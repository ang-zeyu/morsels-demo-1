[6] Tracks of a pack of at least two other wolves came by trap where  1051 was caught; however, there was never any other indication that  1051 may have been a member of a pack.    [7] A frozen foot prevented 1057 from staying with her pack; but she  did associate with other wolves intermittently and with the whole pack  when it came by her restricted area.      The precise ages of the radiotagged wolves were unknown. All  individuals, however, had sharp unworn teeth, indicating that they  were all relatively young. No. 1051, the only male studied, had testes  2.0 cm. long and 1.5 cm. wide; their volume therefore would be less  than 4.5 cc. The small size of these testes, compared with the 7 to 28  cc. reported by Fuller and Novakowski (1955) as the volume of the  testes from wolves taken during fall, would indicate that 1051 had not  yet matured. Since the animal's testes and canine lengths were  considerably greater than those of pups caught in a later study, we  presume 1051 was 18 or 30 months old.    Two of the females, No. 1055 and No. 1059, both captured in January,  had vulvas that seemed to be beginning to swell. No. 1059 was killed by  a trapper about a year later, on January 10, 1970, and an examination  revealed that she had bred in 1969 and carried five fetuses. Sectioning  her incisors and reading the apparent annulations indicated that she  probably was 3+ or 4+ years old.[8]    Three of the wolves were basically lone individuals. One of these, No.  1051, was captured on a night when tracks of at least two other wolves  came by the trap, and this could mean that he had been part of a pack.  However, it is also possible that these were merely tracks of  non-associated wolves that were also traveling through the area. In any  case, 1051 was not seen associating with any other wolf until 4 months  after he was caught, and even then the association seemed to be  temporary and casual. It could be argued that capture, handling by  humans, or wearing a collar prevented him from regaining old  associations or making new ones. However, the wolves radiotagged by  Kolenosky and Johnston (1967) were quickly accepted back into their  packs, and so were two of ours. Thus we conclude that 1051 probably was  a lone wolf when captured.    When 1053 was trapped, her tracks were the only ones in the area, and  she was never seen closely associating with another wolf. No. 1055  probably was with another wolf when captured, as evidenced by tracks.  About a month after she was radiotagged she associated with another  wolf intermittently for about 2 weeks, after which she was only seen  alone.    No. 1057 and No. 1059 were both members of packs. No. 1057 was captured  during the night after a pack of 13 wolves was seen heading toward the  area; 5 days later she was seen with 10 other wolves, which no doubt  represented this same pack. This wolf's association with the pack was  interrupted, however, because of the foot injury sustained during  capture. When 1059 was caught, tracks of two other wolves were seen in  the immediate vicinity, and one of the animals was seen within a  quarter mile of the trapped wolf. Three days after 1059's release, and  perhaps sooner, she was back with her pack, with which she remained at  least through March.    The detailed histories of the associations of the radiotagged wolves  will be discussed in a later section.    Radiotagged wolves were tracked every day that weather permitted during  December, January, and February; every week during March, April, and  May; and once a month during June, July, and August (fig. 16).  Information was obtained for a total of 570 \"wolf-days\"--a wolf-day  being a day in which one radiotagged wolf was located; a pack of five  being located for 1 day would constitute 5 wolf-days.    [Illustration: _Figure 16.--Distribution of the days on which data were  obtained for each of the radiotagged wolves. Because tracking success  was 99 percent, this also represents the distribution of effort. During  June, July, and August, wolves 1053 and 1059 were located 1 day each  month._]    The last day that animals 1051 and 1057 were heard from was April 24,  1969. Both had traveled long distances during the previous week and may  have moved out of range. Signals from wolf 1055 were last heard on May  30; this animal had also been ranging widely. Circles with radii of at  least 50 miles around the last known locations of each wolf were  searched unsuccessfully for the signals. During all subsequent tracking  nights for the remaining wolves, the missing animals were also sought,  but to no avail. Before the last dates that signals from these animals  were heard, attempts to locate marked animals from the air had failed  in only three instances.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] _David W. Kuehn, Personal correspondence to L. D. Mech, 1970._      Daytime Activity Patterns    When radiotagged wolves were located, notes were kept on the type of  activity they were engaged in; the results are summarized in figure 17.  In a total of 171 observations made between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.,  the wolves were resting 62 percent of the time, traveling 28 percent  and feeding 10 percent. They tended to travel more before 11:00 a.m.  and after 3:00 p.m., although resting still composed at least 45  percent of the activity during every hour (fig. 18).    [Illustration: _Figure 17.--Percentage of time spent by radiotagged  wolves in various types of activity throughout the day, from December  through April._]    [Illustration: _Figure 18.--Generally the wolves rested during most of  the day. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    These results generally agree with the statement by Mech (1966a) that  wolves on nearby Isle Royale tend to rest about 11:00 a.m. and begin  traveling again about 4:00 p.m. However, it does appear that the  Minnesota wolves spend much more of the day resting than do the Isle  Royale animals. The difference may be caused by the difference in pack  sizes studied. The Isle Royale pack of 15 to 16 may have had to travel  more to find enough food to feed all its members than did the lone  wolves and pack of five in the present study.      Movements and Range    Wolf movement is greatly hindered by deep, soft snow, so during winter  travel, wolves frequently use areas where they sink into the snow the  least. In our study area, frozen waterways are used extensively where  possible, just as reported by Stenlund (1955). Where few lakes or  rivers exist, wolves follow railroad beds and logging roads, often soon  after a plow or other vehicle has driven on them. In cutting cross  country through deep snow, wolves travel single file and tend to stick  to windblown ridges and to trails of deer and moose. Wolves that have  ranges small enough to cover in a few days form a network of their own  trails, which they can maintain merely by traveling regularly over  them. Packs on Isle Royale depended a great deal on such a system of  trails (Mech 1966a), and so did Pack No. 1059 in our study area.    Wolf packs can travel up to 45 miles in a day but it is usually larger  packs that do so (Stenlund 1955, Burkholder 1959, Mech 1966a, Pimlott  _et al._ 1969). In our study area we sometimes saw evidence of long  moves by large packs along strings of lakes and waterways. However,  most of our movement data pertain to lone wolves and a pack of five.  The daily travel of these animals was usually much less than that  reported for large packs.    Our radiotracking data provide an index to the extent of travel for  each wolf rather than the actual amount of travel, for it is based on  straight line distances between consecutive points at which an animal  was found. This measure will be referred to as the \"net daily  distance.\"    Much variation was found in the net daily distances of wolves, with the  longest ranging from 4.5 miles for 1057 to 12.8 for 1055 (table 3). The  mean net daily distance for each animal, excluding days with no net  movement, varied from 1.5 to 3.6 miles. The movements of these wolves  may have been affected by the snow depth and penetrability, for mean  and maximum net daily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37599"],[0,"The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders (#3)"],[1,"Flanders--the son of Claes,  he that later on shall be known by the name of Ulenspiegel. Philip  will grow up to be a common hangman, being the child of the Emperor  Charles the Fifth, the destroyer of our country. But Ulenspiegel  will be a master of the merry words and frolics of youth, yet good  of heart withal, having for his father Claes, the brave working man  that knows how to earn his own living with courage, honesty, and  gentleness. Charles the Emperor and Philip the King will go riding  their way through life, doing evil by battle, extortion, and other  crimes. But Claes, working hard all the week, living according to right  and according to law, and laughing at his laborious lot instead of  being cast down thereby, will be the model of all the good workpeople  of Flanders. Ulenspiegel, young and immortal, will ramble over the  world and never settle in one place. And he will be peasant, nobleman,  painter, sculptor, all in one. And he will continue his wanderings  hither and thither, lauding things beautiful and good, and laughing  stupidity to scorn. Claes, then, O noble people of Flanders, is your  courage; Soetkin your valiant motherhood; Ulenspiegel your soul. A  sweet and gentle maiden, lover of Ulenspiegel and immortal like him,  shall be your heart; and Lamme Goedzak, with his pot-belly, shall be  your stomach. And up aloft shall stand the devourers of the people; and  beneath them their victims. On high the thieving hornets; and below the  busy bees. While in heaven bleed for evermore the wounds of Christ.\"    And when she had thus spoken, Katheline, the kindly sorceress, went  to sleep.              VI      One day Claes caught a large salmon, and on the Sunday he and Soetkin  and Katheline and the little Ulenspiegel had it for their dinner. But  Katheline only ate enough to satisfy a sparrow.    \"How now, mother?\" said Claes. \"What has happened to the air of  Flanders? Has it suddenly grown solid, so that to breathe it is as  nourishing as a plate of beef? Why, if such were the case, I suppose  you will be telling me that the rain is as good as soup, and the hail  like beans, and the snow some sort of celestial fricassee, fit cheer  for a poor traveller?\"    But Katheline shook her head, and said not a word.    \"Dear me,\" said Claes, \"our mother is in the dumps it seems! What  can it be that grieves her so?\"    But Katheline spake as follows, in a voice that was like a breath  of wind:    \"The wicked night falls blackly. He tells of his coming from afar,  screaming like the sea-eagle. I tremble, and pray to Our Lady--all  in vain. For the Night knows neither walls nor hedges, neither doors  nor windows. Everywhere, like a spirit, he finds a way in. The ladder  creaks. The Night has entered into the loft where I am sleeping. The  Night seizes me in arms that are cold and hard as marble. His face  is frozen, and his kisses like damp snow. The whole cottage seems to  be tossed about over the earth, riding like a ship at sea....\"    Claes said: \"I would counsel you to go every morning to Mass, that  our Lord Christ may give you strength to chase away this phantom  from hell.\"    \"He is so beautiful!\" said Katheline.              VII      Ulenspiegel was weaned, and began to grow like a young poplar. And  soon Claes gave up caressing him, but loved him in a roughish manner,  fearing to make a milksop of him. And when Ulenspiegel came home  complaining that he had got the worst of it in some boyish affray,  Claes would give him a beating because, forsooth, he had not beaten  the others. And with such an education Ulenspiegel grew up as valiant  as a young lion.    When Claes was from home, Ulenspiegel would ask his mother to give him  a liard with which he might go out and amuse himself. Soetkin would  grow angry, and ask why he wanted to go out for amusement--he would  do better to stay at home and tie up faggots. And when he saw that  she was not going to give him anything, the boy would start yelling  like an eagle, while Soetkin made a great clatter with the pots and  pans that she was washing in the wooden tub, pretending that she did  not hear his noise. Then Ulenspiegel would fall to weeping, and the  gentle mother would stop her pretence at harshness, and would come  and kiss him.    \"Will a denier be enough for you?\" she would say.    Now it should be noted that a denier is equal to six liards.    Thus did his mother dote on Ulenspiegel even to excess; and when  Claes was not there, he was king in the house.              VIII      One morning Soetkin saw Claes pacing up and down the kitchen with  head bent, like a man lost in thought.    \"Whatever is the matter with you, my man?\" she asked him. \"You are  pale, and you look angry and distracted.\"    Claes answered her in a low voice, like a dog growling.    \"The Emperor is about to reissue those cursed placards. Death once  again is hovering over the land of Flanders. The Informers are to  have one half of the property of their victims, if so be that such  property does not exceed the value of one hundred florins.\"    \"We are poor,\" Soetkin said.    \"Not poor enough,\" Claes answered. \"Evil folk there are--crows  and corpse-devouring vultures--who would as readily denounce us  to the Emperor for half a sackful of coal as for half a sackful of  florins. What had she, poor old Widow Tanneken that was wife to Sis  the tailor, she that was buried alive at Heyst? Nothing but a Latin  Bible, three gold florins, and a few household utensils of English  pewter. But they were coveted by a neighbour. Then there was Joanna  Martens whom they burnt as a witch after she had been thrown into  the water, for her body did not sink and they held it for a sign of  sorcery. She had a few miserable pieces of furniture and seven gold  pieces in a bag, and the Informer wanted his half of them. Alas! I  could go on till to-morrow morning giving you instances of the same  kind. But to cut a long story short, Mother, life's no longer worth  living in Flanders, and all on account of these placards. Soon every  night-time the death-cart will be passing through the town, and we  shall hear the arid click of bones as the skeletons shake in the wind.\"    Soetkin said: \"You ought not to try and frighten me, my man. The  Emperor is the father of Flanders and Brabant, and as such he is  endowed with long-suffering, gentleness, patience, and pity.\"    \"He would be obliged to renounce too much if he were all that,\"  Claes answered, \"for he has inherited a great amount of confiscated  property.\"    At that very moment the sound of a trumpet was heard, and the clash  of the Heralds' cymbals. Claes and Soetkin, carrying Ulenspiegel in  their arms by turns, rushed out towards where the sound came from,  and with them went a great concourse of people. They came to the Town  Hall, in front of which stood the Heralds on horseback, blowing their  trumpets and sounding their cymbals, and the Provost with his staff  of justice, and the Town Proctor, also on horseback and holding in  his hands the Imperial Edict which he was preparing to read out to  the assembled multitude.    Claes heard every word, how \"that it was once again forbidden to all  and sundry to print, read, to possess or to defend, the writings,  books or doctrines of Martin Luther, of John Wycliffe, John Hus,  Marcilius de Padua, AEcolampadius, Ulricus Zwynglius, Philip Melancthon,  Franciscus Lambertus, Joannes Pomeranus, Otto Brunselsius, Justus  Jonas, Joannes Puperis, and Gorciamus; as well as any copies of the  New Testament printed by Adrien de Berghes, Christophe de Remonda,  and Joannes Xel, which books were full of Lutheran and other kinds  of heresy, and had been condemned and rejected by the Doctors of  Theology at the University of Louvain.    \"Likewise and in the same manner it was forbidden to paint, portray  or cause to be painted or portrayed any opprobrious paintings or  figures of God, or of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or of the saints;  or to break, destroy or deface the images or pictures made to the  honour, remembrance or recollection of God, the Virgin Mary, or of  the saints recognized by the Church.    \"Furthermore,\" said the placard, \"no one, whatever his position in  life, should presume to discuss or dispute concerning Holy Writ, even  in regard to matters admittedly doubtful, unless he were a theologian,  well known and approved by some established university.    \"His Sacred Majesty decreed, among other penalties, that  suspected persons should not be allowed to carry on any honourable  occupation. And as for men who had fallen again into error, or who  were obstinate in the same, they should be condemned to be burnt by  fire, slow or fast, either in a covering of straw, or else bound  to a stake, according to the discretion of the judge. Others, if  they were men of noble or of gentle birth, were to be executed at  the point of the sword, while working people were to be hung, and  the women buried alive. Afterwards their heads were to be fixed on  the top of poles for an example. The property of all the aforesaid,  in so far as it was situate in places subject to confiscation, was  to be made over to the benefit of the Emperor.    \"To the Informers His Sacred Majesty gave one half of all the property  of the dead, provided that such property did not exceed, on any one  occasion, a hundred pounds gross in Flemish money. As for the half  that went to the Emperor, he would reserve it for works of piety and  mercy, as was done in the case of the confiscations at Rome.\"    And Claes went away sadly, with Soetkin and Ulenspiegel.              IX      Once again did Soetkin bear under her girdle the sign of approaching  motherhood; and Katheline also was in a like condition. But she was  afraid, and never ventured out of her house.    When Soetkin went to see her, \"Alas!\" said Katheline, \"what shall I  do? Must I smother the ill-starred fruit of my womb? I would rather  die myself. And yet"]]]
