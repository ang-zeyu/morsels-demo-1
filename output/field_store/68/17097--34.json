I wish he were dead, or back in Cairo, this  brute Mahomet!\" The irascible dragoman would then beat his own head  unmercifully with his fists, in a paroxysm of rage.    To comfort him I could only exclaim, \"Well done, Mahomet! thrash him;  pommel him well; punch his head; you know him best; he deserves it;  don't spare him!\" This advice, acting upon the natural perversity of  his disposition, generally soothed him, and he ceased punching his  head. This man was entirely out of his place, if not out of his mind,  at certain moments, and having upon one occasion smashed a basin by  throwing it in the face of the cook, and upon another occasion narrowly  escaped homicide by throwing an axe at a man's head, which missed by an  inch, he became a notorious character in the little expedition.    We left Berber in the evening, and about two hours after sunset of the  following day reached the junction of the Nile and Atbara. The latter  presented a curious appearance. In no place was it less than four  hundred yards in width, and in many places much wider. The banks were  from twenty-five to thirty feet deep, and had evidently been overflowed  during floods; but now the river bed was dry sand, so glaring that the  sun's reflection was almost intolerable. The only shade was afforded by  the evergreen dome palms; nevertheless the Arabs occupied the banks at  intervals of three or four miles, wherever a pool of water in some deep  bend of the dried river's bed offered an attraction. In such places were  Arab villages or camps, of the usual mat tents formed of the dome-palm  leaves.    Many pools were of considerable size and of great depth. In flood-time a  tremendous torrent sweeps down the course of the Atbara, and the sudden  bends of the river are hollowed out by the force of the stream to a  depth of twenty or thirty feet below the level of the bed. Accordingly  these holes become reservoirs of water when the river is otherwise  exhausted. In such asylums all the usual inhabitants of this large river  are crowded together in a comparatively narrow space. Although these  pools vary in size, from only a few hundred yards to a mile in length,  they are positively full of life; huge fish, crocodiles of immense size,  turtles, and occasionally hippopotami, consort together in close and  unwished-for proximity. The animals of the desert--gazelles, hyenas, and  wild asses--are compelled to resort to these crowded drinking-places,  occupied by the flocks of the Arabs equally with the timid beasts of  the chase. The birds that during the cooler months would wander free  throughout the country are now collected in vast numbers along the  margin of the exhausted river; innumerable doves, varying in species,  throng the trees and seek the shade of the dome-palms; thousands of  desert grouse arrive morning and evening to drink and to depart; while  birds in multitudes, of lovely plumage, escape from the burning desert  and colonize the poor but welcome bushes that fringe the Atbara River.    After several days' journey along the bank of the Atbara we halted at a  spot called Collodabad, about one hundred and sixty miles from the Nile  junction. A sharp bend of the river had left a deep pool about a mile in  length, and here a number of Arabs were congregated, with their flocks  and herds.    On the evening of June 23d I was lying half asleep upon my bed by the  margin of the river, when I fancied that I heard a rumbling like  distant thunder. I had not heard such a sound for months, but a low,  uninterrupted roll appeared to increase in volume, although far distant.  Hardly had I raised my head to listen more attentively when a confusion  of voices arose from the Arabs' camp, with a sound of many feet, and  in a few minutes they rushed into my camp, shouting to my men in the  darkness, \"El Bahr! El Bahr!\" (the river! the river!)    We were up in an instant, and my interpreter, Mahomet, in a state of  intense confusion, explained that the river was coming down, and that  the supposed distant thunder was the roar of approaching water.    Many of the people were asleep on the clean sand on the river's bed;  these were quickly awakened by the Arabs, who rushed down the steep bank  to save the skulls of two hippopotami that were exposed to dry. Hardly  had they descended when the sound of the river in the darkness beneath  told us that the water had arrived, and the men, dripping with wet, had  just sufficient time to drag their heavy burdens up the bank.    All was darkness and confusion, everybody talking and no one listening;  but the great event had occurred; the river had arrived \"like a thief in  the night\". On the morning of the 24th of June, I stood on the banks of  the noble Atbara River at the break of day. The wonder of the desert!  Yesterday there was a barren sheet of glaring sand, with a fringe of  withered bushes and trees upon its borders, that cut the yellow expanse  of desert. For days we had journeyed along the exhausted bed; all  Nature, even in Nature's poverty, was most poor: no bush could boast a  leaf, no tree could throw a shade, crisp gums crackled upon the stems  of the mimosas, the sap dried upon the burst bark, sprung with the  withering heat of the simoom. In one night there was a mysterious  change. Wonders of the mighty Nile! An army of water was hastening to  the wasted river. There was no drop of rain, no thunder-cloud on the  horizon to give hope. All had been dry and sultry, dust and desolation  yesterday; to-day a magnificent stream, some five hundred yards in width  and from fifteen to twenty feet in depth, flowed through the dreary  desert! Bamboos and reeds, with trash of all kinds, were hurried along  the muddy waters. Where were all the crowded inhabitants of the pool?  The prison doors were broken, the prisoners were released, and rejoiced  in the mighty stream of the Atbara.    The 24th of June, 1861, was a memorable day. Although this was actually  the beginning of my work, I felt that by the experience of this night  I had obtained a clew to one portion of the Nile mystery, and that, as  \"coming events cast their shadows before,\" this sudden creation of a  river was but the shadow of the great cause. The rains were pouring in  Abyssinia! THESE WERE SOURCES OF THE NILE!    The journey along the margin of the Atbara was similar to the route from  Berber, through a vast desert, with a narrow band of trees that marked  the course of the river. The only change was the magical growth of the  leaves, which burst hourly from the swollen buds of the mimosas. This  could be accounted for by the sudden arrival of the river, as the water  percolated rapidly through the sand and nourished the famishing roots.    At Gozerajup, two hundred and forty-six miles from Berber, our route was  changed. We had hitherto followed the course of the Atbara, but we were  now to leave that river on our right, while we travelled about ninety  miles south-east to Cassala, the capital of the Taka country, on the  confines of Abyssinia, and the great depot for Egyptian troops.    The entire country from Gozerajup to Cassala is a dead flat, upon which  there is not one tree sufficiently large to shade a full-sized tent.  There is no real timber in the country; but the vast level extent of  soil is a series of open plains and low bush of thorny mimosa. There is  no drainage upon this perfect level; thus, during the rainy season, the  soakage actually melts the soil, and forms deep holes throughout the  country, which then becomes an impenetrable slough, bearing grass and  jungle. No sooner had we arrived in the flooded country than my wife was  seized with a sudden and severe fever, which necessitated a halt upon  the march, as she could no longer sit upon her camel. In the evening  several hundreds of Arabs arrived and encamped around our fire. It  was shortly after sunset, and it was interesting to watch the extreme  rapidity with which these swarthy sons of the desert pitched their camp.  A hundred fires were quickly blazing; the women prepared the food, and  children sat in clusters around the blaze, as all were wet from paddling  through the puddled ground from which they were retreating.    No sooner was the bustle of arrangement completed than a gray old man  stepped forward, and, responding to his call, every man of the hundreds  present formed in line, three or four deep. At once there was total  silence, disturbed only by the crackling of the fires or by the cry of  a child; and with faces turned to the east, in attitudes of profound  devotion, the wild but fervent followers of Mahomet repeated their  evening prayer. The flickering red light of the fires illumined the  bronze faces of the congregation, and as I stood before the front line  of devotees, I tools off my cap in respect for their faith, and at the  close of their prayer made my salaam to their venerable Faky (priest);  he returned the salutation with the cold dignity of an Arab.    On the next day my wife's fever was renewed, but she was placed on a  dromedary and we reached Cassala about sunset. The place is rich in  hyenas, and the night was passed in the discordant howling of these  disgusting but useful animals. They are the scavengers of the country,  devouring every species of filth and clearing all carrion from the  earth. Without the hyenas and vultures the neighborhood of a Nubian  village would be unbearable. It is the idle custom of the people to  leave unburied all animals that die; thus, among the numerous flocks  and herds, the casualties would create a pestilence were it not for the  birds and beasts of prey.    On the following morning the fever had yielded to quinine, and we were  enabled to receive a round of visits--the governor and suite, Elias Bey,  the doctor and a friend, and, lastly, Malem Georgis, an elderly Greek  merchant, who, with great hospitality, insisted upon our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32376"],[0,"Notes on Stable Management in India and the Colonies (#3)"],[1,"her. The bran should only be damped sufficiently to make it stick  together, and should not be sloppy and wet. Some horses at first will not  eat bran, but they can be tempted to by mixing a handful of whatever grain  they have been used to with it.      Oats (_jai_).    Oats are now largely grown over the Punjab, Northern India, and in  Tirhoot, and are sold at nearly the same price as barley. In the seaport  towns Australian oats can usually be obtained; and as good oats are grown  in the colonies as any part of the world. They are more expensive than  the native article, and are generally only used for training race-horses  on. The Indian oat, compared with the English, Australian, or South  African, is a poor article, running very light, with a great amount of  husk; but if properly crushed, and mixed with gram and bran in proportions  of one part of each, they are greatly superior to barley. The oat in India  is a winter crop, and is harvested in the spring. Both colonial and Indian  oats are always white. I have never seen the black or tawny variety which  is so common in Ireland. A demand having arisen for them by Europeans, it  is sometimes possible in Northern India to buy them in the bazaar; but  generally it is necessary to make a special arrangement with the grower,  as natives do not use them as a feeding grain for their own animals. They  grow the crop round the wells, and cut it green in the straw as forage for  the well and plough bullocks in the spring, when they are working hard.  Arrangements can generally be made with the cultivator to purchase so much  from him by weight, thrashed and delivered at your own stable, or else to  purchase so many acres of the standing crop as it is growing; but the  former plan is the most satisfactory, as it is astonishing the heavy crop  that will be produced; and, on the contrary, you will be equally  astonished to find with the other plan how light it is. The negotiations  for the supply of oats should be entered into in good time in the  spring--say about the beginning of March--as it is astonishing how slow  such matters progress in the East, and they had better be left in the  hands of your head syce. No doubt you will be cheated out of a small  amount, but you must make up your mind for this before arriving in the  East; but you will have the satisfaction of knowing that if you tried to  carry on negotiations yourself you would be cheated out of more. I have  tried both plans, and found that the syce could drive a better bargain for  both of us than when I attempted to deal direct with the cultivator.      Maize (_makkai_).    Although grown all over India, maize is not much used for feeding horses;  but in South Africa, where it is known as \"mealies,\" it is the staple food  grain for both man and beast. In India it is said to make horses fat and  soft, but no animal in the world does harder work than a South African  post-cart horse. In all probability the reason they do well on maize is  that in the oat-hay forage they get there is a considerable quantity of  grain; and although I have never seen it used, the experiment of feeding  on oats and maize would be worth while trying in India. In South Africa  maize is usually given whole, but in any of the towns it can be obtained  crushed, and it is better to give it in this state. During the Afghan War  maize was plentiful in some parts of the country, and I gave it to some of  the horses that I had charge of. I had it parched on hot sand, in the same  way as barley (adarwah) is parched, making it into American pop-corn. With  certain somewhat thin and debilitated animals it had a marked effect in  getting flesh on them, and all horses eat it greedily. In India maize is a  summer crop, ripening in the autumn, when the ears or cobs are picked off  the stalks. It is stored in the cob, and the individual grains knocked off  as required by rapping them against a stick; but they must be turned over  in the heap occasionally, as rats and mice are likely to cause damage,  particularly the musk rat, that taints everything it comes into contact  with. Horses have frequently been brought to me, said to be off their  feed, and on inquiry I have found this only to be caused by the grain  being tainted by musk rats, and that when a clean feed is offered to them  they devour it ravenously. There are in South Africa and America a number  of varieties of maize, but in India I only know of two sorts, in one of  which the seeds are white and the other yellow, or a deep red colour. I  don't think that there is much difference in them as far as horse food  goes, but each individual grain should be plump, and fill out the husk  well; they should be free from weevils, worms, or the marks of attacks  from rats and mice. The husk should be well filled out, and have a  shining, pearl-like, glistening appearance, and when let fall on a stone  or other hard substance give off a metallic sound. When broken open, the  grain inside should be of a pure white colour, and of a pleasant, mealy  smell, like fresh flour. If it is discoloured, it denotes that it has been  wet and fermented. Maize can be crushed by most grain-crushing machines,  also in the native mill (chuckie) if the stones are properly set; but both  in South Africa and India the natives pound it in a large wooden mortar  made out of the trunk of a tree.      Wheat (_ghehun_).    Although it is not to be recommended as a food, still I have seen wheat  used when no other grain could be obtained, and it was a choice of it or  nothing at all; and in parts of Australia, and, I believe, America, it is  regularly used as a horse food. It is commonly supposed that wheat is  almost a rank poison to horses, and will cause fever in the feet; and no  doubt with stabled animals in England it will do so, especially as the  majority of cases of this nature are from accidents--horses getting loose  and gorging themselves with wheat during the night, or when unobserved.  With animals standing out in the open and working hard, as they do in  India and the colonies, it is not so dangerous. I should not suddenly  change a horse's feed from oats or gram to a full ration of wheat; but  when nothing else can be got, it can be given in a small quantity without  much fear of danger; but as soon as any other grain could be obtained, it  should be used.      Rice (_dhan_).    In Eastern Bengal and Assam horses are fed on unhusked rice and will do  well on it. During the expedition into the Lushai Hills in 1879-80, in  many places nothing else could be got to feed the transport mules on. Gram  is not grown in that part of the country, and what little there is has to  be imported, and is at a prohibitive price. I found that animals did well  enough on an equal mixture of gram and rice, although at first some of  them refused it. In Japan rice is the only grain horses get, and the pack  ponies of that country are hardy beasts, and appear to work well on it. If  the rice can be crushed, it is all the better; and in Bengal and Assam  there is no difficulty in getting this done, as it is the food of the  people, and they grind it for their own use.      Millet (_bajara_).    The various millets, known in South Africa as \"Kaffir-corn,\" are not often  used in India as horse food, but in the Cape it sometimes is. In India the  millet is a summer crop harvested in the autumn. The seeds are small, and  of a dark or greyish colour. It requires to be crushed before use, as the  husk is very hard.      Pulses (_dhal_).    The various species of pulse grains enter largely into the food of the  natives of India. Two, known as \"mung\" and \"mote,\" or \"moat,\" are  excellent for getting flesh on thin, debilitated animals. They are both  small oblong seeds of an olive green colour, with a very hard husk, and  can be obtained in any bazaar. I prefer the mote to the mung. They both  require to be well boiled to the consistency of a jelly before use, and  then being well mixed in with the food, about a pound in weight of the raw  seed being enough for each feed, so that the horse gets three pounds  daily, a corresponding quantity of the other grain being withdrawn. I have  seen most excellent results in weak animals recovering from a debilitating  illness from its use, but great care must be taken that it is boiled  properly.      Linseed (_ulsie_).    Linseed can be obtained all over India. In fact, a good deal of what is on  the English market comes from the East. Under certain conditions it is  useful in putting on flesh, and as a diet for convalescents; but care must  be exercised in its use, as it contains a great deal of oil, and in cases  of sickness with liver complications, which are common in a hot climate,  especially in English and Australian horses, it is to be avoided. It has  to be boiled to a jelly before use, or, better still, soak it in cold  water for some hours until soft, and then boil it. In the hot weather,  however, I prefer to use either the \"mote\" or \"mung\" to linseed.      Linseed Cake (_rhal_ or _khal_).    Linseed cake can be obtained in nearly every large town, and is the  residue left after the oil is expressed; but as this process is  imperfectly performed, a good deal of oil is left--much more than in the  steam-pressed English cake. It is sold by the \"seer\" (2 lbs. weight), but  in irregular lumps, not moulded into cakes as in Europe. Care must be  taken in buying it, as it is very likely to be musty, and adulterated with  mustard or rape seed. Both these can be easily detected by the taste or  smell, leaving a pungent odour and a sharp burning taste behind. The best  plan is to crush a small quantity of the cake and drop it into some  boiling water, when the sharp smell and taste characteristic of the  mustard and rape oil will be given off. A small quantity of linseed cake  in the food will fatten horses tremendously, but makes them soft in  condition. It is one of the articles used"]]]
