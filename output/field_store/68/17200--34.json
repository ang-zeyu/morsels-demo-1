Taking everything into consideration, I am inclined to favour the belief  held by some, that our own fireside cat was first domesticated from our  mountain wild cat.  I mentioned, this to a naturalist of some repute,  with whom I was dining only a few days ago.    \"_What_?\" he roared, trying to get across the table, in order to jump  down my throat.  \"_You_ ought to know, sir, that all animals increase,  instead of degenerating in size, by being transplanted to domestic  life.\"    I didn't contradict the man in his own house; but indeed, reader, the  rule, if rule it be, admits of numerous exceptions.  It holds good among  horses, and I suppose cattle of all kinds; it even holds good if we go  down the scale of organic life, and apply it to fruit and flowers; but  how about the wilder animals, and our forest trees?  Take the latter  first--will the acorns of a garden-grown oak-tree, or the cone of a  transplanted Scotch pine, produce such noble specimens as those that  toss their giant arms in the forest or on mountain-side?  Or will a  menagerie-bred lion, or tiger--feed them ever so well--ever reach the  noble proportions of those animals who in freedom tread the African  desert, or roam uncaged and untrammelled through the jungles of Eastern  India?  What prison-born elephant ever reached in height to the  shoulders even, of the gigantic bulls that my poor friend, Gordon  Cumming, used to slay?  Do eagles, owls, the wilder hawks, alligators,  or anacondas do anything else but degenerate in captivity?  But even  admitting, hypothetically, that the rule would hold good as regards  cats, there isn't such a very great difference in the size of the tame  and wild cats after all.  I do not think that all the wild cats ever I  saw in Scotland or elsewhere, would average over ten to twelve pounds;  and twelve pounds is no unusual weight for our domestic cheety.  Another  thing that has often struck me is this: the farther north you go in  Scotland, and the nearer to the abode of the wild cat, the greater is  the resemblance in head and tail, and often in colour, of the tame cat  to the wild.  And, mark you, the domestic is often known to inter-breed  with the wild cat, and the offspring can be tamed and reared.  This is  considered nothing unusual in the Highlands.    CHAPTER THREE.    BREEDS AND CLASSES.  THE TORTOISESHELL.    The classification I propose of the domestic cat is an exceedingly  simple one, as I think all classifications ought to be; it will, I  trust, however, be found quite sufficient, and a useful one.  We have  first, then, the two and only two distinct breeds mentioned above,  viz:--One.  The European Cat.  Two.  The Asiatic.    From these two alone, if you get them of different colours, you can very  easily manufacture all the varieties and various-coloured pussies you  are ever likely to meet with, either on the show-benches or in domestic  life.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    ONE.  The European, short-haired, or Western Cats.    These I divide into five primary classes, namely--1, _Tortoiseshell_; 2,  _Black_; 3, _White_; 4, _Blue_ or _Slate-colour_; and 5, the _Tabbies_.    The _Tortoiseshell_ I subdivide into secondary classes: 1, the pure  Tortoiseshell; and 2, the Tortoiseshell-and-white.    The _Black_ is subdivided likewise into two: 1, pure Black; and 2,  Black-and-white.    The _White_ has no subdivision, but is bred in with any or all the other  classes.    The _Blue_ or _Slate-coloured Cat_.  These are subdivided into two: 1,  the pure Blue; and 2, the Blue-and-white.    _Tabbies_ are easily subdivided into four classes, viz:--1, the Red  Tabby; 2, the Brown Tabby; 3, the Blue or Silver Tabby; and 4, the  Spotted Tabby.    There are other odd cats, such as the Manx or tailless cat, the hybrid,  the six-clawed cat, and some curiously-coloured animals, which I shall  mention in another place, for these have no right to have classes of  their own, any more than black-and-tan Newfoundlands, or kittens with  eight legs.    I shall take these in their order of rotation.    1.  _The Tortoiseshell Cat_.--This might also be called the  black-and-tan cat.  If you want to get a good idea of the colour this  cat is, or ought to be, take a keek through a lady's tortoiseshell  back-hair comb.  That is about it; but you never see such perfection in  pussy's coat.    For many a long year it was almost universally believed that there never  was any such thing as a tortoiseshell male or Tom cat, or ever could be;  and many an anxious search has many an old maid had over her newly-born  litter of kits, to see if she would be fortunate enough to find the  much-to-be-desired anomaly.  For, bear in mind, a belief used to be  pretty current that 300 pounds--or was it 500 pounds?--would be paid  over some counter, by some fool or fools unknown, to anyone who should  be able to put the possibility of the existence of a tortoiseshell Tom  beyond dispute--by producing one.  I saw an advertisement the other day  in _The Live Stock Journal_, offering for sale a tortoiseshell Tom, at  the low price of 100 pounds!  I hope, if only for poor Tom's sake, that  somebody with more money than brains bought it--for the cat anyone paid  100 pounds for would, I should think, be certain of good milk and  generous treatment.    I knew a poor old woman in Skye, and this old woman's pussy was as  pussies love to be.  And lo! one night the old woman, in the silence of  night, dreamed a dream.  She thought that the cat came to her bedside,  and said to her, \"Arise, mistress, come and see.\"  That she followed  pussy at once.  That pussy led her to the barn.  That there she found,  cuddled together in a heap upon an old sack, no less than five  tortoiseshell Toms.  She dreamt besides that she sold the lot for 1,000  pounds each, and bought a carriage and four, right off the reel, and set  up for a lady of fashion on the spot.  Anxiously did the old woman watch  for her cattie's accouchement, but much to her disappointment they all  had white about them.  Next time that pussy was in the same way, her  mistress had an old tortoiseshell comb nailed up above its bed.  Even  this didn't do, so--for by this time the ancient dame had tortoiseshell  Tom on the brain--she set out for Portree, a distance of fully sixteen  miles, where she managed to procure a live tortoise as a playmate for  her pet.  Pussy never took much to the tortoise; all she did was to sit  and watch it, and whenever it protruded its scaly head, the cat smacked  it in again.  This might have been the reason why her kittens had all  white about them the third time.  The old woman didn't despair, however;  she took to praying, and prayed in English, and prayed in Gaelic, and  she told me seriously that she never doubted but that her prayers would  one day be answered--_if_, she added, _it was for her good_.  I didn't  doubt it either, but Tom never came ashore as long as I was in the  island, neither was the old creature's snuff-box ever empty.    I have but little fancy for this breed myself.  They are usually  sour-tempered, unfriendly little things to all save those who own and  love them.  They are, moreover, not very prepossessing.  I speak of the  cat as _I_ have found it, and I doubt not there are many exceptions.    _Merits_.--They are excellent and patient mousers, and the _best_ of  hunters.  They are likewise good mothers.  They are as game as a bull  and terrier--in fact they seem to fear nothing on four legs; and when  they do take off the gloves to fight, I pity the animal they tackle, for  what the tortoiseshell lacks in weight, she makes up for amply in  courage.  They are very wise and sagacious, and faithful to the death to  those who own them.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: You don't look for a very large cat of the pure  tortoiseshell breed, nor a very pretty one.  The larger the better to a  certain extent.  I have known a small-sized tortoiseshell cat follow the  rats even into their own burrows, again and again, until she had  exterminated them. 2.  _Head_: The head is small and rather bullety, the  ears moderately large and nicely cocked, and the eyes small, and the  darker the better. 3.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is as near  tortoiseshell as possible, and the markings must not only be deep and  pretty, but very distinct in the centre, although blending insensibly  where they meet, and artistically arranged.  You mustn't expect to find  the colour or markings very nicely arranged on the male tortoiseshell.  No white is allowed on this breed of cat.  Tortoiseshell Tom _is_  tortoiseshell Tom, and prefers to be judged alone and on his own merits;  for, as a rule, his right there is none to dispute. 4.  _Pelage_ or  _Coat_: Hair moderately short, but _very_ fine, glossy, and silken.  N.B.--Knock off from five to eight points for _cinder-holes_.  I now  give the points in a tabular form, with their full value.  Not,  remember, that as a rule I go in for judging by points; still, a table  of this sort has its value, as one can see just at a glance what is  looked for in each breed, and what isn't:--    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Points of the Tortoiseshell Cat.    1.  Size, 5.    2.  Head, 10.    3.  Colour and markings, 25.    4.  Pelage, 10.    Total, 50.    The next pussy which demands a few passing remarks is _The  Tortoiseshell-and-white_.  This is often a very beautiful cat, more  especially when young, as, when old, they sometimes degenerate into very  lazy habits, especially if they have a large amount of white about them.  They are pretty, and they seem to know it, taking great delight in  keeping the white portions of their fur as pure as snow.  I knew a cat  something of this breed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37350"],[0,"The Ancestry of Modern Amphibia: A Review of the Evidence (#3)"],[1,"large size, distinctly separate from the  exoccipital and prootic. Either this bone is a neomorph, which seems  improbable, or there has not been in the ancestry of this particular  family an episode of reduction comparable to that seen in the  terrestrial families, where there is an operculum instead of a normal  opisthotic. Therefore the Proteidae probably are not derived from the  general stem of other salamanders, but diverged sufficiently long ago  that the bones of the otic region were reduced on a different pattern.  They need not be removed from the order, but, in this respect,  recognized as more primitive than any other existing Urodela or Anura. A  recent paper by Hecht (1957) discusses many features of _Necturus_ and  _Proteus_, and shows that they are remote from each other; his evidence  does not seem to prove, however, that they were of independent origin or  that they need be placed in separate families.          VERTEBRAE AND RIBS      Development of the vertebrae and ribs of Recent Amphibia has been  studied by Gamble (1922), Naef (1929), Mookerjee (1930 a, b), Gray  (1930) and Emelianov (1936), among others. MacBride (1932) and Remane  (1938) provide good summaries. In this section reference will be made to  the embryonic vertebral cartilages by the names used for them in these  studies, although the concept of \"arcualia\" is currently considered of  little value in comparative anatomy.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Development of Anuran vertebrae. Upper left, late  tadpole of _Xenopus laevis_; lower left, same just after metamorphosis;  upper right, diagram of general components of primitive Anuran vertebra.  (After MacBride, 1932, Figs. 35, 38, 47D, respectively.) Lower right,  section through anterior portion of urostyle, immediately posterior to  sacral vertebra, in transforming _Ascaphus truei_ (original, from  specimen collected on Olympic Peninsula, Washington). All x 20 approx.  For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]    The centrum in Anura (Fig. 5) is formed in the perichordal sheath  (_Rana_, _Bufo_) or only in the dorsal portion thereof (_Bombinator_,  _Xenopus_). The neural arch develops from the basidorsal cartilages that  rest upon, and at first are entirely distinct from, the perichordal  sheath. Ribs, present as separate cartilages associated with the 2nd,  3rd and 4th vertebrae in the larvae of _Xenopus_ and _Bombinator_, fuse  with lateral processes (diapophyses) of the neural arches at  metamorphosis, but in _Leiopelma_ and _Ascaphus_ the ribs remain freely  articulated in the adult. Basiventral arcualia have been supposed to be  represented by the hypochord, a median rod of cartilage beneath the  shrinking notochord in the postsacral region, which at metamorphosis  ossifies to produce the bulk of the urostyle. Fig. 5, lower right, a  transverse section taken immediately posterior to the sacral ribs in a  transforming specimen of _Ascaphus_, shows that the \"hypochord\" is a  mass of cartilage formed in the perichordal sheath itself, and very  obviously is derived from the ventral part of postsacral perichordal  centra; there are, then, no basiventral arcualia, and the discrete  hypochord shown in MacBride's diagram (Fig. 5, upper right) of a frog  vertebra does not actually occur below the centrum, but only below the  notochord in the postsacral region.    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Development of Urodele vertebrae. Upper figures,  _Triton_: at left, larva at 20 mm., at right, diagram of components of  vertebra (from MacBride, 1932, figs. 17, 47C).

Lower figures,  _Necturus maculosus_ larva: left, at 21 mm.; right, at 20 mm. (from  MacBride, 1932, figs. 41.5, 41.3 respectively, after Gamble, 1922). All  x 20 approx. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]    In Urodela (Fig. 6) the pattern of vertebral and rib development is more  complex, and there has been much controversy over its interpretation.  Neural arches and perichordal centra form in the same manner as in  frogs, but with the addition in certain cases (_Triton_) of a median  supradorsal cartilage, which gives rise to the zygapophyses of each  neural arch. Difficulty comes, however, in understanding the  relationship of the ribs to the vertebrae. Each rib, usually  two-headed, articulates with a \"transverse process\" that in its early  development seems to be separate from both the vertebra and the rib, and  is therefore known, noncommittally, as \"rib-bearer.\" This lies laterally  from the centrum, neural arch, and vertebral artery; upon fusing with  the vertebra it therefore encloses the artery in a foramen separate from  the one between the capitulum and tuberculum of the rib (the usual  location of the vertebral artery). At least four different  interpretations of these structures have been suggested:    (1) Naef (1929) considered the rib-bearer a derivative of the  basiventral, which, by spreading laterally and dorsally to meet the  neural arch, enclosed the vertebral artery. He then supposed that by  reduction of the rib-bearer in other tetrapods (frogs and amniotes) the  vertebrarterial foramen and costal foramen were brought together in a  single foramen transversarium. The implication is that the Urodele  condition is primitive, but it cannot now be supposed that Urodela are  ancestral to any other group, and the rib-bearer is most probably a  specialization limited to salamanders. This does not, of course,  invalidate the first part of his interpretation.    (2) Remane (1938), noting that rib insertions of early Amphibia are  essentially as in Amniota, argued that the rib-bearer is not from the  basiventral but is a neomorph which originates directly from the neural  arch and grows ventrally. This he inferred mainly from Gamble's (1922)  observation on _Necturus_, but his assumption that _Necturus_ is more  primitive than other salamanders (such as the Salamandridae), where the  pattern differs from this, is not necessarily correct. Rather, the  perennibranchs are distinguished mainly by their neotenous features, and  their development is likely to show simplifications which are not  necessarily primitive. The suggestion of a \"neomorph\" ought not to be  made except as a last resort, for it is simply an acknowledgment that  the author does not recognize homology with any structure already known;  sometimes further information will make such recognition possible.    (3) Gray (1930), using _Molge taeniatus_, concluded that the normal  capitulum of the rib was lost, but that the tuberculum bifurcated to  make the two heads seen in Urodela, thus accounting for the failure of  the costal foramen to coincide with that of the vertebral artery. This  answer, too, seems to entail an unprovable assumption which should not  be made without explicit evidence.    (4) Finally, Emelianov (1936) regarded the rib-bearer as a rudimentary  _ventral_ rib, on account of its relationship to the vertebral artery,  and considered the actual rib to be a neomorph in the _dorsal_ position  characteristic of tetrapod ribs in general. This argument would fit the  ontogenetic picture satisfactorily, provided that (_a_) there were some  evidence of ventral, rather than dorsal, ribs in early Amphibia, and  (_b_) we accept the invention of another neomorph in modern Amphibia as  an unavoidable necessity. Emelianov's conclusion (p. 258) should be  quoted here (translation): \"The ribs of Urodela are shown to be upper  ribs, yet we find besides these in Urodela rudimentary lower ribs fused  with the vertebral column. The ribs of Apoda are lower ribs. In Anura  ribs fail to develop fully, but as rare exceptions rudiments of upper  ribs appear.\"    Of these various interpretations, that of Naef seems to involve the  minimum of novelty, namely, that the rib-bearer is the basiventral,  expanded and external to the vertebral artery. It is not necessary to  take this modification as the ancestral condition in tetrapods, of  course. The basiventral (=intercentrum) would merely have expanded  sufficiently to provide a diapophysis for the tuberculum as well as the  (primitive) facet for the capitulum. No neomorph appears under this  hypothesis, which has the distinct advantage of simplicity.    Figures of early stages in vertebral development by the authors  mentioned show that the basidorsals chondrify first, as neural arches,  while a separate mass of mesenchyme lies externally and ventrally from  these. This mesenchyme may chondrify either in one piece (on each side)  or in two; in _Molge_ the part adjacent to the centrum is ossified in  the 20-mm. larva, and subsequently unites with the more dorsal and  lateral cartilaginous part, while the rib, appearing farther out, grows  inward to meet this composite \"rib-bearer.\" In _Necturus_ the mesenchyme  below the neural arch differentiates into a cartilage below the  vertebral artery (position proper to a basiventral), a bridge between  this and the neural arch, and a rib, the latter two chondrifying later  than the \"basiventral\" proper. In the \"axolotl\" (presumably _Ambystoma  tigrinum_) the rib-bearer grows downward from its first center of  chondrification at the side of the neural arch (Emelianov, 1936).    Thus it appears that the simplest hypothesis to account for the  rib-bearer is that (_a_) it is the basiventral, (_b_) it is recognizable  just before chondrification as a mass of mesenchyme in contact with both  the notochordal sheath and the basidorsal cartilage, (_c_) it may  chondrify or ossify first in its ventral portion or in its dorsal  portion, the two then joining before it fuses with the rest of the  vertebra, (_d_) the enclosure of the vertebral artery is a consequence  of the extension of the basiventral beyond the position occupied by it  in primitive Amphibia, and (_e_) there is no indication that this took  place in "]]]
