These are the men who have not yet unfolded. They are in the  chrysalis condition--and to be pitied accordingly. They may depend upon  it, when they pass from the _slough_, they will be ready to confess they  are, alas! too deep in that other \"Slough of Despond,\" which is too well  represented by a sad sensitiveness to the magic of Beauty, and as sad a  consciousness that there is no approach for them, which can be crowned by  a capture of the citadel, or the least enjoyment of the glorious delights  it encloses. When we hear men deteriorating this power, or thanking the  gods they never bent knee or uttered vow at its shrine, we are ever ready  to believe they have either bowed all their days to far other and sadder  principles, and made oath to idols of bad material and worse sculpture, or  that they are as much beyond the reach of any good, and proper, and  beautiful influence, as the clod of the valley to which they are  hastening. They may take pride in denial of such influence--but what is  there to boast of in insensibility of any kind, where the very betrayal of  admiration is the best evidence of a good taste--a good feeling--a good  faith--a good principle? It cannot have escaped common observation, we  presume, that a love of Beauty--or, at least, any peculiar sensitiveness  to that quality in the female sex, has been held--and by sensible men,  too--as a weakness, or an index only of a weak mind, or a feminine spirit.  This is certainly very foolish--and a lamentable mistake. But it is easily  accounted for. It will be observed that the doctrine is never held save by  men who see beauty in things which other persons would hold abhorrent.  They are men who are in love with metaphysics, or glory in a mathematical  existence. They like, beyond all, the _features_ of a problem, and think  only of the _good face_ of a speculation. They see, as they profess, at  least, no proportions, save in some cold system of an absurd philosophy,  and are only fit for judgment in things either too abstract for the mass  of men, or too decidedly \"earthy\" to be worthy the attention of beings  made for a better sphere, and capable of seeing something in much that is  around us, which intimates the order and beauty by which that sphere is  distinguished. This is enough to put an end to this objection, in  reference to the subtle element of which we are venturing our humble, but  we believe, orthodox sentiments. For ourselves, we know of no more sad or  senseless mental condition in which we could be placed--we mean in the  social relation--than this one of such ungraceful stupidity, as this of  which a boast is made by such weary fellows as we have adverted to. If  Beauty is an _outside_ principle, which they argue is of no utility, and  quite unworthy of one who should look beyond the mere _coating_ of this  existence for his reward or his satisfaction, then we say that even an  _outside_ of loveliness and grace, is better than an _interior_ of  deformity, uselessness, indefiniteness, chaos--even though it pretend to  be all spiritual, while it suggests little but nonsense, and is quite  certain to end in nothing.    There is another thought in connexion with this element of Beauty in  Woman, which certainly deserves consideration. We believe the philosophy  which it intimates is founded in very good sense, and withal, in  propriety. Insensibility to the power, we have observed, is no index of  anything virtuous or elevated. It is rather, in all cases, a bad omen. Men  look upon it--and that very rationally--as indicative of something  unhealthy in the moral system. It seems to tell of a hardness--bad  propensities--a crustaceous nature. In short, man regards his fellow, who  is dead to this influence, as rather to be suspected at all times, than to  be trusted at any. But this is not his saddest trial--or what should be  regarded as such, if he can sign himself a man, with any conscience  whatever. His estimation by woman is unqualified and unquestioned. He is  set down by her as a creature as unworthy of regard by the sisterhood, as  he is devoid of warmth or wit in anything that has to do with the social  relations, and, above all, with the mysteries of the passions and  affections. He is marked by them with a timble brand. He is set apart as  a poor thing, who knows nothing of what he was made for, and whose ideas  of the graceful and lovely in life are about as defined and worthy as  those of the brutes that perish. He is run upon and laughed at by the  playful, and satirised and scathed by the witty. In the circle he is  treated--not pitied--as a piece of circulating insensibility; in the  street he is pointed at as one who might be well set up as a mark at its  corners. And this is right. It is well he should be visited by rebuke from  her who presents so continually around him the elements of that power he  is foolish to resist, and unable, after all, to depreciate. Woman's  opinion, here, is a part of the great system which the influence she  defends is meant to support--and we truly hope that she will maintain it  aloud as long as she can utter it. Of the power of Beauty, both the world  of fact, and the world of fancy, are abounding in instances. The records  of ancient story present us with their Helens and their Cleopatras, who  wrought upon nations by the magic of their faces. Later times show us the  wonder of the power in Mary of Scotland, and many a page might be adverted  to, full of the adventures which marked the love passages of kings as well  as clowns, originating in this mysterious influence, as developed in the  graces and glories of woman.    The power of Beauty operates widely, and everywhere. It takes the good man  captive as well as the miscellaneous one, who has no definite rule to  guide him on his wanderings. It bows the masters and teachers of men at  its shrine, as well as the scholars and children of life. It draws the  merchant from his desk--the philosopher from his chair. It gives new  utterance to the poet, while it wins the statesman to confess that there  is some virtue in the outside of the world, after all, and some attraction  apart from the chaos of cabinets and broad seals.    There is a beautiful exemplification of this power given by Florian, in  his story of a Theban sculptor. He is a wandering orphan in the streets  of his native city, and his first entrance into the workshop of the  celebrated Praxitiles well proves the truth of what we have set down in  the foregoing pages.--\"He is suddenly transported on beholding so many  masterpieces of art! He gazes upon them--he is lost in admiration! and  turning to Praxitiles with an air of grace and juvenile freedom, \"Father,\"  cried he, \"give _me_ the chisel, and teach me to become as great as thou  art.\" Praxitiles stared at the boy, astonished at the fire of enthusiasm  which kindled in his eyes, and embracing him with affection, \"Yes!\" said  he, \"remain with me; I will now be _your_ master, but my hope shall be  that you may soon be _mine_.\"    The pupil soon becomes worthy of his teacher. He becomes the heir of his  fortune, and removes to Miletus. There, the daughter of the governor  visits his statuary, and from the time of that visit, his destiny is  sealed. Love usurps the place of every other passion, and the chisel is  cast aside in silence, under that supremacy. The Venus of marble that  adorned his study, was no longer a Venus before that living one which  filled his eye and his bosom. He felt that he must tell his love, or die.  He declares it, in a hurried letter--a slave betrays him--and the  indignant father accuses him before the council. He is banished from the  city--and embarks in a Cretan vessel.    At this time pirates surprise the city, and pillage the temple of Venus.  The statue of that goddess is torn from its pedestal. It was the Palladium  of the island, and on its possession hung the happiness of the Milesians.  The oracle of Delphos was consulted, and it was answered that Miletus  would not be safe till a new statue of Venus, beautiful as the Goddess  herself, should replace that ravished by the pirates. The inhabitants were  in despair. They accused the governor of unjustly banishing the only man  who might now save the city. He is seized, and hurried in chains to a  dungeon. Now came the trial of the daughter, whose beauty had brought on  this fearful crisis. She equips her vessel, and with treasures about her,  determines to go in person to Athens--Corinth--Thebes--to find some artist  who should emancipate her father. Tempted to land on a delicious island,  she there comes suddenly upon her lover, whom she had been taught to  believe had been long laid under the waters that lashed the heights of  Naxos.    The story is soon told. In the humble cabin of his solitude he had  prepared a statue which he said would meet the demand of the sybil. But he  claimed to have it placed veiled upon the pedestal in the temple of  Miletus, before she should even look upon the marble. She consents--and  they embark for that island. The artist is received with shoutings and  joy. The statue is borne to its trial on the altar of Venus. It stands  erect. He fears nothing--and it is unveiled. The features are not  mistaken--and the people utter cries of joy as they behold the image of  his mistress! The enamored sculptor had made her, in his loneliness, the  model of his Venus!--He is called on to claim his reward. \"Release him you  have imprisoned,\" he cried--\"release her father--and I ask no more.\"--It  is done--and the father gives up the daughter to his preserver, at the  foot of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#3)"],[1,"is primarily  yellowish or reddish brown, except in _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ and  _P. ignicolor_ in which it is green. Usually there are some darker  blotches or reticulations on the dorsum. The venter usually is white;  in _P. ignicolor_ it is yellow. The venter is spotted in all members  of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group; the species, arranged from  least to most spotting ventrally, are: _P. euthysanota euthysanota_,  _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_, _P. leonhardschultzei_, and _P.  spinipollex_. The last two species also have bold dark spots on the  flanks. _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ lacks spots on the venter, whereas  _P. ignicolor_ has small dark flecks ventrally.    _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum_ have white stripes on  the upper lips and on the flanks. All species have some form of a pale  stripe above the anus and usually rather distinct white or pale  stripes along the ventrolateral edges of the tarsi and forearms. There  are no bright or boldly marked flash-colors (colors that are revealed  only when the hind limbs are extended), except in _P. ignicolor_,  which has bright red flash-colors in the groin and on the thighs. In  life the iris varies from several different shades of bronze color to  deep red in _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_.    The degree of metachrosis is moderate. Usually any change of color in  life consists only of change in the intensity of color. At times when  the over-all coloration is darkened some markings are obscured.        Osteology    The following description of the skull, hyoid, sternum, and prepollex  is based on a male specimen of _P. spinipollex_ (KU 68632) that has  been cleared and stained. The broad, flat skull (Fig. 3) has a large  frontoparietal fontanelle. The ethmoid is large and has a flange  laterally. The nasals are of moderate size and in broad contact with  the ethmoid, but are separated from one another medially. The anterior  half of the maxillary bears a thin, high flange. The anterior process  of the squamosal is short and widely separated from the maxillary. The  quadratojugal is a small spine-shaped element projecting anteriorly  from the ventral base of the quadrate; the quadratojugal does not  articulate with the maxillary.        [Illustration: FIG. 3. Dorsal aspect of skull of _Ptychohyla          spinipollex_ (KU 68632). Arrow indicates reduced          quadratojugal.]      The posteromedian part of the hyoid plate is calcified; from this  plate the long bony, posterior cornua (thyrohyales) extend  posterolaterally.    The omosternum is calcified, widest anteriorly, and has a convex  anterior edge. The calcified xiphisternum is roughly bell-shaped  having short lateral processes anteriorly and a deep notch  posteriorly.    The swollen thumb is supported by a dorsoventrally flattened spine  that does not extrude through the skin.    VARIATION.--In general, the skull varies little. Usually the  quadratojugal is present only as a short element attached to the  quadrate, but in one specimen of _P. spinipollex_ the quadratojugal  articulates with the maxillary and forms a complete  quadratojugal-maxillary arch on each side of the skull. One specimen  of _P. leonhardschultzei_ has a complete arch on one side and an  incomplete arch on the other.    Only _P. spinipollex_ has lateral processes anteriorly on the  xiphisternum; in the other species the xiphisternum is deeply  bell-shaped.    _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and _P. ignicolor_ have slightly longer  premaxillaries than the other species. The longer premaxillary is  reflected in the larger number of teeth on the bone--9 to 11 (average  10) in four specimens of _P. schmidtorum_ and 10 teeth in one _P.  ignicolor_, as compared with 6 to 10 (average 7.9) in seven specimens  of the other species. The number of maxillary teeth in the various  species are: _P. euthysanota euthysanota_, 43; _P. euthysanota  macrotympanum_, 38; _P. leonhardschultzei_, 38 and 40; _P.  spinipollex_, 34 and 40; _P. schmidtorum schmidtorum_, 37 and 43; _P.  schmidtorum chamulae_, 40 and 41; _P. ignicolor_, 43. The teeth on the  premaxillary and anterior part of the maxillary are long, pointed, and  terminally curved backwards. Posteriorly on the maxillary the teeth  become progressively shorter and blunter.    Variation in number of vomerine teeth is shown in Table 1.        [Illustration: FIG. 4. Tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group:          (A) _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ (KU 60042),          (B) _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ (KU 60049),          (C) _P. leonhardschultzei_ (KU 68556), and          (D) _P. spinipollex_ (KU 60053).]      Tadpoles    Tadpoles of the genus _Ptychohyla_ are adapted to live in mountain  streams. The bodies are streamlined, and the tails are long and have  low fins (Figs. 4 and 5). The mouths are large and directed ventrally.  Tadpoles of the two groups of species have strikingly different  mouthparts.        [Illustration: FIG. 5. Tadpoles of          (A) _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_ (KU 60051),          (B) _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ (KU 58199), and          (C) _P. ignicolor_ (KU 71716).]      Lips of tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group (Fig. 6 A-D)  are folded laterally; there are 4/6 or sometimes 4/7 tooth-rows. A  lateral \"wing\" projects on either side of the upper beak. The beaks  have blunt, peglike serrations. Lips of tadpoles of the _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ group (Fig. 6 E-G) are greatly expanded and form a  funnel-shaped disc; there are 3/3 short tooth-rows. There is no  lateral projection or \"wing\" on either side of the upper beak. The  beaks have long, pointed serrations.      [Illustration: FIG. 6.

A small tadpole of _P. euthysanota  euthysanota_ has six lower rows and three fully developed upper rows  and only the beginning of the first (outer) upper row. A small tadpole  of _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ has four upper rows and five lower  rows. In a small tadpole of _P. leonhardschultzei_ the three upper and  four lower tooth-rows are well developed; the first upper and fifth  lower rows are beginning to develop, and the sixth lower row is  absent. In small tadpoles of _P. spinipollex_, the sixth lower row is  poorly developed, and the seventh row is absent; large individuals  normally have seven lower rows. A small tadpole of _P. schmidtorum  chamulae_ has 3/2 tooth-rows.        Breeding Call    Breeding calls of all species and subspecies of _Ptychohyla_ were  recorded in the field. Obtaining series of calls of _Ptychohyla_ is  difficult because these frogs call mostly from vegetation along  roaring mountain streams and only by locating a calling frog some  distance from the water or along a quiet stretch of the stream can  good recordings be obtained. For example, four individuals of _P.  spinipollex_ were recorded, but only one recording was sufficiently  free of background noise to be analyzed.    Analysis of breeding calls supports the division of the genus  _Ptychohyla_ into two groups of species. The call of each member of  the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group consists of a single long note,  whereas the call of species in the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group  consists of a series of short notes. Since no differences were found  between the calls of subspecies of any given species, the following  discussion of breeding calls pertains to species. These calls are  described briefly below and at greater length in the systematic  accounts farther on. Audiospectrographs of the breeding calls are  shown in Plate 11, and comparisons of the characteristics of the calls  are given in Table 3.
