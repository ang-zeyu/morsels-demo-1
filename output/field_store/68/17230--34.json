These are usually accompanied by overcast sky and  sometimes a slight amount of precipitation. These \"nortes\" may cause a  drop in temperature of about six to eight degrees in a few hours.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Climatographs for Minatitlan, Veracruz, and  Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, based on data given by Contreras (1942). Plotted  points are for mean monthly temperatures and rainfall; months are  indicated by numbers.]      _Vegetation_    The topography and climate combine to produce drastically different  types of climax vegetation on the northern and southern lowlands of the  isthmus. The picture is somewhat complicated by the savannas on the  Gulf Coastal Plain, which, as will be shown later, are dependent upon  edaphic features more than climatic conditions. The following brief  account of the vegetation in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is based on  data provided by Williams (1939) and Goldman (1951), supplemented by  personal observations. The purpose of this description is not to  analyze the flora of the isthmus, but to give the reader a picture of  this aspect of the biota of the major environments with which I shall  be concerned in the ensuing discourse on the amphibians of the region.  The three divisions of the isthmus recognized in the account of the  physiography serve equally well in describing the vegetation. Those  divisions are as follows:    Gulf Lowlands    On the lowlands north of the continental divide and extending to the  Gulf of Mexico are three major types of vegetation--tropical  rainforest, arid tropical scrub forest, and savanna. Aside from these,  there are marshes and lagoons near the coast.    On the coastal dunes there are thickets of sea grape, patches of  _Cenchrus_, and clumps or scattered _Opuntia_. The lagoons are bordered  by mangrove thickets made up primarily of _Lonchocarpus hondurensis_.  In the marshes along the lower Rio Coatzacoalcos and Rio Papaloapan the  tall tough grass, _Gynerium sagittatum_, is common.    According to Beard (1953: 291) the development of savanna vegetation is  dependent upon soil, topography, and drainage. Level regions having  permeable soil horizons lying on top of an impermeable horizon provide  poor drainage. In most savanna regions in the Americas the grasslands  become waterlogged or even partly flooded during the rainy season and  desiccated in the dry season. Many ecologists and phytogeographers have  postulated that savannas are either man made or are examples of a fire  climax. Beard (_op. cit._: 203) provided multitudinous evidence that  the association of savanna vegetation and certain types of edaphic and  topographic conditions was so strongly marked that grassland is the  natural vegetation in these areas.    Savannas are scattered through southern Veracruz eastward to British  Honduras. These usually are grasslands having scattered trees or clumps  of trees around depressions, which may contain water throughout the  year (Pl. 1, fig. 1). According to Williams (_op. cit._), the most  common trees in the savannas in southern Veracruz are _Ceiba  pentandra_, _Chlorophora tinctoria_, and _Byrsonima crassifolia_.    Lying in a rain shadow cast by the Tuxtlas and on sandy and  well-drained soils is a dense xerophytic forest. The crown of this  deciduous forest usually is little more than ten to twelve meters above  the ground (Pl. 1, fig. 2). Conspicuous trees in this scrub forest are  _Acacia cornigera_, _Bauhinia latifolia_, _Calliandra bijuga_, _Cassia  laevigata_, _Guazuma ulmifolia_, and various species of _Bursera_.    The most extensive type of vegetation on the Gulf Coastal Plain is a  tall evergreen forest resembling tropical rainforest. Although this  forest is made up of many species of trees that are characteristic of  true rainforest, the forest on the Gulf Coastal Plain cannot be  classified as true rainforest, neither by the climatic conditions, nor  the structure of the forest. The seasonal variation in rainfall  probably is the chief factor in hindering the development of a  rainforest climax vegetation. Usually a minimum of 65 mm. of rainfall  each month is considered essential for the development of true  rainforest. At Minatitlan the average rainfall for March (39 mm.) and  April (36 mm.) is far below this minimum. Structurally, this forest has  a crown about 30-35 meters above the ground but individual trees rising  five meters or more above the crown (Pl. 2, figs. 1-2). There is no  clear stratification within the forest; in many parts of it there are  dense growths of bushes, small trees, and palms. The forest on the Gulf  Coastal Plain, therefore, most properly might be referred to as a  quasi-rainforest, a term that has been applied to other such forests in  tropical America.    Among the abundant and dominant trees in this forest are _Swietenia  macrophylla_, _Calophyllum brasiliense_, _Achras zapota_, _Ceiba  pentandra_, _Castilla elastica_, _Cedrela mexicana_, _Tabebuia  Donnell-Smithi_, _Calocarpum mammosum_, _Bombax ellipticum_, and a  variety of _Ficus_. Epiphytes and Ilianas are abundant.    Central Ridges    The vegetation of the central ridges of the isthmus is, for the most  part, transitional between the tall rainforest of the Gulf Coastal  Plain and the low xerophytic scrub forest of the semi-arid Pacific  Coastal Plain. On the northern slopes of the ridges the rainforest is  more poorly developed than on the plains to the north. Many of the same  species of trees are present, including _Ceiba pentandra_, _Cedrela  mexicana_, _Swietenia macrophylla_, and _Ficus_ sp.; nevertheless,  these seldom are as large as members of the same species in the forest  on the plains. Other species present on the forested slopes include  _Tabebuia Donnell-Smithi_, _Zanthoxylum melanostictum_, _Pithecolobium  arboreum_, and a species of _Pterocarpus_. The structure of this forest  differs from that on the Gulf Coastal Plain in that there is no  continuous upper canopy and there is a dense undergrowth (Pl. 3, fig.  1). This type of forest extends from Mogone southward to about Matias  Romero.    In the vicinity of Matias Romero open pine-oak forest (_Pinus caribaea_  and _Quercus_ sp.) is found on some ridges as low as 250 meters above  sea level.    On the Plains of Chivela in the southern part of the central region  the vegetation takes on a semi-arid appearance, especially in a savanna  on the plains. Clumps of small trees and bushes, consisting of _Croton  nivea_, _Cordia cana_, _Jacquinia aurantiaca_, _Calycophyllum  candidissimum_, and _Cassia emarginata_, are scattered on a grassy  plain, from which rise widely-spaced palms of an unknown species (Pl.  3, fig. 2).    Pacific Coastal Plain    The vegetation of the Pacific lowlands definitely is semi-arid in  character. Most of the trees are deciduous, thorny, and short. During  the dry season the landscape presents a barren appearance, but shortly  after the first summer rains dense green foliage appears (Pl. 4, figs.  1 and 2). Between Juchitan and La Ventosa few trees are more than two  meters high (Pl. 5, fig. 1). In many areas the trees and bushes form an  almost impenetrable tangle, whereas on especially rocky soils or on  slopes those plants are more widely spaced. Abundant and widespread  species of trees on the Plains of Tehuantepec include _Acacia  cymbispina_, _Prosopis chilensis_, _Caesalpinia coriaria_, _Caesalpinia  eriostachys_, _Celtis iguanaea_, _Cordia brevispicata_, _Jatropha  aconitifolia_, and _Crescentia alata_.    Montane Vegetation    In order to illustrate the interruption of subtropical and temperate  types of vegetation by the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, it  is necessary to digress for a moment from the isthmus and consider the  types of vegetation present on the adjacent highlands. On the higher  peaks, such as Cerro de Zempoaltepetl, above about 2500 meters is fir  forest (_Abies religiosa_); lower on the slopes are extensive pine  forests, which on some slopes are mixed with oak or replaced entirely  by oaks. Subtropical cloud forest, characterized by relatively cool  temperatures and high humidity, is found at elevations usually between  1000 and 1800 meters on the windward slopes of the Sierra Madre  Oriental in Veracruz and northern Oaxaca and on the northern and  southern slopes of the Chiapan-Guatemalan Highlands. None of these  forest types is continuous across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.      _The Sierra de los Tuxtlas_    Although actually located in the region of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,  the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, because of its isolated position, need not  be considered in great detail in analyzing the distribution of animals  inhabiting the lowlands of the isthmus. Nevertheless because some  species living in the highlands adjacent to the isthmus also live in  the Tuxtlas, this range is briefly described here. The Sierra de los  Tuxtlas is a range of volcanos lying near the Gulf Coast in southern  Veracruz between the mouths of the Rio Papaloapan and the Rio  Coatzacoalcos. Volcan San Martin, the highest peak, rises above 1800  meters. This range of volcanos is surrounded by lowlands, which  immediately to the south and west are covered with savanna and in  places by scrub forest. The luxuriant nature of the vegetation on these  volcanos indicates that this range receives much more rainfall than the  surrounding lowlands. Especially on the northern slopes, tropical  rainforest is well developed; this is replaced at about 1200 meters by  cloud forest. The southern and western slopes are drier, for the lower  slopes are covered with a scrubby, but evergreen, forest.    Detailed comments on the herpetofauna of the Tuxtlas have been omitted  purposefully, for the reptiles and amphibians of the region currently  are being studied by Douglas Robinson.

Sydney at present has with its suburbs attained already to the dimensions  of a European city. Only thirty years ago there stood but a few herdsmen's  huts, where now the visitor beholds block after block of handsome stone  private residences, or magnificent shops. There is not one article of  luxury or comfort which cannot be supplied here. The chief building stone  of the locality, sandstone, is chiefly used in the erection of churches,  public buildings, and private dwellings. The Exchange, the Bank, the  Houses of Assembly, Government House, &c., are stately buildings erected  in a solid, massive style, and if \"Hyde Park,\" a treeless meadow in the  centre of the city, by no means answers to its sounding title, the Botanic  Garden, on the other hand, the park known as \"Lady McQuarrie's Chair,\"  \"Kissing-Point,\" and \"Lovers' Walk,\" form promenades as delightful as any  capital of Europe can show in such immediate proximity. Sydney, moreover,  is amply supplied with gas and water, as well as with every means of  conveyance that can facilitate intercourse in a large town, such as  omnibuses, cabs, steamers, &c.    The theatres hitherto, whether as regards scenery or performance, have  hardly exceeded mediocrity, but on the other hand educational  establishments, public libraries, and hospitals, are of singular  excellence. It is truly marvellous, and especially makes a profound  impression upon the denizens of old Europe, to observe what handsome,  imposing, costly buildings have been run up among this comparatively  youthful community. The Sydney University, founded in 1851, is built in  the Gothic style, at an expense of L50,000, and is maintained by an annual  grant of L5000. It is far the finest memorial erected by European  civilization in honour of science, throughout the southern hemisphere. Its  internal organization is somewhat analogous with that of those of the  mother country. All the high schools of Sydney accord academic degrees in  the various branches, and by a Royal Patent of 27th of February, 1858,  holders of honours are raised to the same rank with those in the other  universities of the Empire. Although only secular education is provided by  the University, there have been founded four colleges in immediate  proximity with each other, for the four principal religious denominations  in the colony, Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Methodist, in  which the scholars may, without prejudice to the secular character[5] of  the University proper, receive instruction in their various beliefs. The  erection of these four adjuncts cost about L40,000 more. At the period of  our visit there were only 38 scholars enrolled, whose instruction cost the  state a rather round sum. A commencement had been made with a library, a  museum of natural history, and a numismatic collection.    Besides the University, there are in Sydney a considerable number of very  important educational establishments and public schools. The most  strenuous exertions are made to keep the public schools in a high state of  efficiency, and there is scarcely a hamlet, where the rising generation  may not be instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, and  geography.[6]    An observatory is also in course of erection, but meteorological  observations had long since been carried on in the principal places of the  colony, and from the favourable natural conditions of the continent for  conducting such investigations, the results must greatly contribute to our  acquaintance with the laws regulating atmospherical phenomena.    One very deserving institution dedicated to the noble object of awakening  a sense of the beautiful, and furthering the interests of science, is the  Australian Museum. All that this glorious country presents of interesting  and useful in the three great divisions of nature is here being gradually  classified in scientific order, and displayed in elegant cases in spacious  handsome apartments, the whole thrown open to the public for amusement and  instruction, free of cost. Already an excellent start has been made with  valuable collections of conchylia and birds, as well as numerous  ethnographical specimens and fossil remains. The management of the Museum  has been confided to the most distinguished scientific men of the  colony,[7] and owing to the deep interest taken by these gentlemen in this  truly national undertaking, the sphere of its activity is likely ere long  to be extended to scientific publications, the appearance of which will be  doubly valuable and important in a country which presents so many  different objects for investigation and elucidation.    If, however, our knowledge of Australia and its black aboriginal tribes is  as yet very scanty, it has not assuredly been due to any cold indifference  on the part of the new settlers for the history of a country and a race of  men who are rapidly disappearing from the face of the country. It is  rather to be found in the physical conditions of the continent, and  especially in the great scarcity of perennial springs. In fact, there is  hardly any country, with the exception of Africa, the exploration of which  has cost the lives of so many scientific travellers as this fifth quarter  of the world. What manly devotion, ardour, and perseverance, characterize  such names as Leichhardt, Oxley, Kennedy, Eyre, Mitchell, Cunningham,  Strut, Babbage, Warburton, Stuart, Gregory, Selwyn, MacDonnell, &c.! And  it may fill a German with honest pride, that one of his race has attained  the pinnacle of scientific eminence here! The name of Leichhardt is the  most popular and most highly honoured of the learned names in Australia.  Repeatedly we heard him spoken of as the Australian Humboldt. Rendered all  the more eager by the success of his first enterprise, and stimulated by  the splendid Governmental reward of L10,000 for his last discoveries, the  indefatigable explorer started from Sydney in 1848, on a second journey,  in which he intended to examine Western Australia, by crossing from  Moreton Bay overland, to the West Coast and Port Essington. This proved to  be the close of his earthly career. All trace of the lamented traveller  has been lost, and even the admirably equipped expedition sent out by the  Colonial Government, in March, 1858, under the experienced conduct of Mr.  Gregory, on the track of Leichhardt, spent long months in fruitless  wandering, and returned without any more positive information as to the  destiny of the sorely missed naturalist, except the conjecture that  Leichhardt and his companions had fallen a victim not to the murderous  hand of the natives, but to the inhospitable nature of the region they  were traversing. They seemed to have left the Victoria at its junction  with the Alice (where it was thought a trace of the travellers was  discovered in some incisions made in the bark of some trees),[8] and then  attempted, favoured by heavy storms and showers of rain, to get into the  flat desert country on the north-west. As, however, the rain shortly  afterwards ceased, the unfortunate travellers not merely ran short of  water in prosecuting their dismal journey, but were prevented from  returning, as the small quantity precipitated by a mere meteoric  phenomenon would be exhausted in a few days, and it is not easy to suppose  that such hardy, zealous, and experienced explorers would have failed to  extricate themselves, had not their courage and physical powers been  broken down and destroyed by privations of the most terrible nature.    Despite the tragic fate of Leichhardt's expedition and those of other  explorers,[9] new expeditions are continually being set on foot for  exploring the unknown regions of Australia in every direction, and  although by far the larger part of the information collected consists  rather of ghastly recitals of misery and privation endured than positive  scientific results,[10] yet some of the more recent ones, especially those  of Stuart and Burke, have made also important discoveries in the  interior; and in view of the impulse which the lamentable state of  American politics threatens to impart to cotton-growing everywhere, the  highly fertile banks of the Murray, which with a very little labour might  be made navigable far into the interior, may at no distant period be  covered with numerous cotton plantations.    While the younger and more adventurous spirits enter with all their heart  and soul upon these dangerous experiences of rude hardship, there is in  the capital of the colony a not less marked scientific vitality, and the  valuable libraries and private collections of the Governor-general, Sir  Wm. Denison, Mr. W. Macleay, the botanist, Dr. George Bennett, physician  and geologist,[11] Dr. Roberts, microscopist, Messrs. W. B. Clarke and  Selwyn, geologists, as well as their various and valuable contributions to  science, exercise a doubly important and beneficial influence upon a  number of contiguous states so peculiarly organized as those of Australia,  which, first penal settlements, and then gold-fields, seemed to have been  deprived of all those favourable conditions, which elsewhere are usually  supposed to be requisite for the development of intellectual and  scientific activity.    Much has also been done already in Australia for the diffusion of the  principles of social economy and the diffusion of political and linguistic  knowledge; and the historical writings of Dr. J. D. Lang,[12] and the  philological works of Dr. Threlkeld, both men of high attainments and of  similar zeal in promoting the welfare of their fellow-men, furnished us  with profound information as to the political history of the country, as  well "]]]
