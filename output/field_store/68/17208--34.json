[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#3)"],[1,"money,\" said they, \"but for your approval, and to share your  glory.\"    Napoleon with his wonderful tact had introduced a slight change  into the artillery service, which was productive of immense moral  results. The gun carriages had heretofore been driven by mere  wagoners, who, being considered not as soldiers, but as servants,  and sharing not in the glory of victory, were uninfluenced by any  sentiment of honor. At the first approach of danger, they were  ready to cut their traces and gallop from the field, leaving their  cannon in the hands of the enemy. Napoleon said, \"The cannoneer  who brings his piece into action, performs as valuable a service as  the cannoneer who works it. He runs the same danger, and requires  the same moral stimulus, which is the sense of honor.\" He therefore  converted the artillery drivers into soldiers, and clothed them in  the uniform of their respective regiments. They constituted twelve  thousand horsemen who were animated with as much pride in carrying  their pieces into action, and in bringing them off with rapidity and  safety, as the gunners felt in loading, directing, and discharging  them. It was now the great glory of these men to take care of their  guns. They loved, tenderly, the merciless monsters. They lavished  caresses and terms of endearment upon the glittering, polished,  death-dealing brass. The heart of man is a strange enigma. Even  when most degraded it needs something to love. These blood-stained  soldiers, brutalized by vice, amidst all the honors of battle,  lovingly fondled the murderous machines of war, responding to the  appeal \"call me pet names, dearest.\" The unrelenting gun was the  stern cannoneer's lady love. He kissed it with unwashed, mustached  lip. In rude and rough devotion he was ready to die rather than  abandon the only object of his idolatrous homage. Consistently he  baptized the life-devouring monster with blood. Affectionately he  named it Mary, Emma, Lizzie. In crossing he Alps, dark night came  on as some cannoneers were floundering through drifts of snow,  toiling at their gun. They would not leave the gun alone in the  cold storm to seek for themselves a dry bivouac; but, like brothers  guarding a sister, they threw themselves, for the night, upon the  bleak and frozen snow, by its side. It was the genius of Napoleon  which thus penetrated these mysterious depths of the human soul,  and called to his aid those mighty energies. \"It is nothing but  imagination,\" said one once to Napoleon. \"Nothing but imagination!\"  he rejoined. \"Imagination rules the world.\"    When they arrived at the summit each soldier found, to his surprise  and joy, the abundant comforts which Napoleon's kind care had  provided. One would have anticipated there a scene of terrible  confusion. To feed an army of forty thousand hungry men is not a  light undertaking. Yet every thing was so carefully arranged, and  the influence of Napoleon so boundless, that not a soldier left  the ranks. Each man received his slice of bread and cheese, and  quaffed his cup of wine, and passed on. It was a point of honor  for no one to stop. Whatever obstructions were in the way were to  be at all hazards surmounted, that the long file, extending nearly  twenty miles, might not be thrown into confusion. The descent was  more perilous than the ascent. But fortune seemed to smile. The  sky was clear, the weather delightful, and in four days the whole  army was reassembled on the plains of Italy.    Napoleon had sent Bertlier forward to receive the division, and to  superintend all necessary repairs, while he himself remained to  press forward the mighty host. He was the last man to cross the  mountains. Seated upon a mule, with a young peasant for his guide,  slowly and thoughtfully he ascended those silent solitudes. He was  dressed in the gray great coat which he always wore. Art pictured  him bounding up the cliff, proudly mounted on a prancing charger.  But truth presents him in an attitude more simple and more sublime. Even  the young peasant who acted as his guide was entirely unconscious  of the distinguished rank of the plain traveler whose steps he  was conducting. Much of the way Napoleon was silent, abstracted in  thoughts. And yet he found time for human sympathy. He drew from  his young and artless guide the secrets of his heart. The young  peasant was sincere and virtuous. He loved a fair maid among the  mountains. She loved him. It was his heart's great desire to have  her for his own. He was poor and had neither house nor land to  support a family. Napoleon struggling with all his energies against  combined England and Austria, and with all the cares of an army,  on the march to meet one hundred and twenty thousand foes, crowding  his mind, with pensive sympathy won the confidence of his companion  and elicited this artless recital of love and desire. As Napoleon  dismissed his guide, with an ample reward, he drew from his pocket  a pencil and upon a loose piece of paper wrote a few lines, which he  requested the young man to give, on his return, to the Administrator  of the Army, upon the other side. When the guide returned, and presented  the note, he found, to his unbounded surprise and delight, that he  had conducted Napoleon over the mountains; and that Napoleon had  given him a field and a house. He was thus enabled to be married,  and to realize all the dreams of his modest ambition. Generous  impulses must have been instinctive in a heart, which in an hour  so fraught with mighty events, could turn from the toils of empire  and of war, to find refreshment in sympathizing with a peasant's  love. This young man but recently died, having passed his quiet  life in the enjoyment of the field and the cottage which had been  given him by the ruler of the world.    The army now pressed forward, with great alacrity, along the banks  of the Aosta. They were threading a beautiful valley, rich in verdure  and blooming beneath the sun of early spring. Cottages, vineyards,  and orchards, in full bloom, embellished their path, while upon  each side of them rose, in majestic swell, the fir-clad sides of the  mountains. The Austrians pressing against the frontiers of France,  had no conception of the storm which had so suddenly gathered,  and which was, with resistless sweep, approaching their rear. The  French soldiers, elated with the Herculean achievement they had  accomplished, and full of confidence in their leader, pressed gayly  on. But the valley before them began to grow more and more narrow.  The mountains, on either side, rose more precipitous and craggy.  The Aosta, crowded into a narrow channel, rushed foaming over the  rocks, leaving barely room for a road along the side of the mountain.  Suddenly the march of the whole army was arrested by a fort, built  upon an inaccessible rock, which rose pyramidally from the bed of  the stream. Bristling cannon, skillfully arranged on well-constructed  bastions, swept the pass, and rendered further advance apparently  impossible. Rapidly the tidings of this unexpected obstruction  spread from the van to the rear. Napoleon immediately hastened  to the front ranks. Climbing the mountain opposite the fort, by a  goat path, he threw himself down upon the ground, when a few bushes  concealed his person from the shot of the enemy, and with his  telescope long and carefully examined the fort and the surrounding  crags. He perceived one elevated spot, far above the fort, where a  cannon might by possibility be drawn. From that position its shot  could be plunged upon the unprotected bastions below. Upon the  face of the opposite cliff, far beyond the reach of cannon-balls,  he discerned a narrow shelf in the rock by which he thought it  possible that a man could pass. The march was immediately commenced,  in single file, along this giddy ridge. .......... And even the  horses, insured to the terrors of the Great St. Bernard, were led  by their riders upon the narrow path, which a horse's hoof had never  trod before, and probably will never tread again. The Austrians,  in the fort, had the mortification of seeing thirty-five thousand  soldiers, with numerous horses, defile along this airy line, as  if adhering to the side of the rock. But neither bullet nor ball  could harm them.    Napoleon ascended this mountain ridge, and upon its summit, quite  exhausted with days and nights of sleeplessness and toil, laid  himself down, in the shadow of the rock, and fell asleep. The long  line filed carefully and silently by, each soldier hushing his  comrade, that the repose of their beloved chieftain might not be  disturbed. It was an interesting spectacle, to witness the tender  affection, beaming from the countenances of these bronzed and war-worn  veterans, as every foot trod softly, and each eye, in passing, was  riveted upon the slender form, and upon the pale and wasted cheek  of the sleeping Napoleon.    The artillery could by no possibility be thus transported; and an  army without artillery is a soldier without weapons. The Austrian  commander wrote to Melas, that he had seen an army of thirty-five  thousand men and four thousand horse creeping by the fort, along  the face of Mount Albaredo. He assured the commander-in-chief,  however, that not one single piece of artillery had passed or could  pass beneath the guns of his fortress. When he was writing this  letter, already had one half of the cannon and ammunition of the army  been conveyed by the fort, and were safely and rapidly proceeding  on their way down the valley. In the darkness of the night trusty  men, with great caution and silence, strewed hay and straw upon the  road. The wheels of the lumbering carriages were carefully bound  with cloths and wisps of straw, and, with axles well oiled, were  drawn by the hands of these picked men, beneath the very walls of  the fortress, and within half pistol-shot of its guns. In two nights  the artillery and the baggage-train"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#3)"],[1,"  figure, it would go on, passing through whatever else was in the  way, until its power was lost. I use the term 'bullet,' though as I  said, it isn't properly one.\"    \"By Jove, Tom, it certainly is a dangerous weapon!\"    \"Yes, the range-limit idea is a new one. That's what I've been  working on lately. There are other features of the gun which I'll  explain later, particularly the power it has to shoot out luminous  bars of light. But now we'll see what it will do to the image.\"    Tom took his place at the end of the range, and began to adjust some  valves and levers. In spite of the fact that the gun was larger than  an ordinary rifle, it was not as heavy as the United States Army  weapon.    Tom aimed at the armor-plate, and, by means of an arrangement on the  rifle, he could tell exactly when he was pointing at the scarecrow,  even though he could not see it.    \"Here she goes!\" he suddenly exclaimed.    Ned watched his chum. The young inventor pressed a small button at  the side of the rifle barrel, about where the trigger should have  been. There was no sound, no smoke, no flame and not the slightest  jar.    Yet as Ned watched he saw the steel plate move slightly. The next  instant the scarecrow figure seemed to fly all to pieces. There was  a shower of straw, rags and old clothes, which fell in a shapeless  heap at the end of the range.    \"Say. I guess you did for that fellow, all right!\" exclaimed Ned.    \"It looks so,\" admitted Tom, with a note of pride in his voice. \"Now  we'll try another test.\"    As he laid aside his rifle in order to help Mr. Jackson shift the  steel plate there was a series of yells outside the shed.    \"What's that?\" asked Tom, in some alarm.    \"Sounds like some one calling,\" answered Ned.    \"It is,\" agreed Mr. Jackson. \"Perhaps Eradicate's mule has gotten  loose. I guess we'd better--\"    He did not finish, for the shouts increased in volume, and Tom and  Ned could hear some one yelling:    \"I'll have the law on you for this! I'll have you arrested, Tom  Swift! What do you mean by trying to kill me? Where are you? Don't  try to hide away, now. You were trying to shoot me, and I'm not  going to have it!\"    Some one pounded on the door of the shed.    \"It's Barney Moker!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I wonder what can have  happened?\"          CHAPTER III    A DIFFICULT TEST      Tom Swift opened the door of the improvised rifle gallery and looked  out. By the light of a full moon, which shone down from a cloudless  sky, he saw a man standing at the portal. The man's face was  distorted with rage, and he shook his fist at the young inventor.    \"What do you mean by shooting at me?\" he demanded. \"What do you  mean, I say? The idea of scaring honest folks out of their wits, and  making 'em think the end of the world has come! What do you mean by  it? Why don't you answer me? I say, Tom Swift, why don't you answer  me?\"    \"Because you don't give me a chance, Mr. Moker,\" replied our hero.    \"I want to know why you shot at me? I demand to know!\" and Mr.  Moker, who was a sort of miserly town character, living all alone in  a small house, just beyond Tom's home, again shook his fist almost  in the lad's face. \"Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me?\"  he shouted.    \"I will, if you give me a chance!\" fairly exploded Tom. \"If you can  be cool for five minutes, and come inside and tell me what happened  I'll be glad to answer any of your questions, Mr. Moker. I didn't  shoot at you.\"    \"Yes, you did! You tried to shoot a hole through me!\"    \"Tell me about it?\" suggested Tom, as the excited man calmed down  somewhat. \"Are you hurt?\"    \"No, but it isn't your fault that I'm not. You tried hard enough to  hurt me. Here I am, sitting at my table reading, and, all at once  something goes through the side of the house, whizzes past my ear,  makes my hair fairly stand up on end, and goes outside the other  side of the house. What kind of bullets do you use, Tom Swift?  that's what I want to know. They went through the side of my house,  and never left a mark. I demand to know what kind they are.\"    \"I'll tell you, if you'll only give me a chance,\" went on Tom  wearily. \"How do you know it was me shooting?\"    \"How do I know? Why, doesn't the end of this shooting gallery of  yours point right at my house? Of course it does; you can't deny  it!\"    Tom did not attempt to, and Mr. Moker went on:    \"Now what do you mean by it?\"    \"If any of the bullets from my electric gun went near you, it was a  mistake, and I'm sorry for it,\" said Tom.    \"Well, they did, all right,\" declared the excited man. \"They went  right past my ear.\"    \"I don't see how they could,\" declared Tom. \"I was trying my new  electric rifle, but I had the limit set for two hundred feet, the  length of the gallery. That is, the electrical discharge couldn't go  beyond that distance.\"    \"I don't know what it was, but it went through the side of my house  all the same,\" insisted Mr. Moker. \"It didn't make a hole, but it  scorched the wall paper a little.\"    \"I don't see how it could,\" declared Tom. \"It couldn't possibly have  gone over two hundred feet with the gage set for that distance.\" He  paused suddenly, and hurried over to where he had placed his gun.  Catching up the weapon he looked at the gage dial. Then he uttered  an exclamation.    \"I'm sorry to admit that you are right, Mr. Moker!\" he said finally.  \"I made a mistake. The gage is set for a thousand feet instead of  two hundred. I forgot to change it. The charge, after passing  through the steel plate, and the scarecrow figure, destroying the  latter, went on, and shot through the side of your house.\"    \"Ha! I knew you were trying to shoot me!\" exclaimed the still angry  man. \"I'll have the law on you for this!\"    \"Oh, that's all nonsense!\" broke in Ned Newton. \"Everybody knows Tom  Swift wouldn't try to shoot you, or any one else, Mr. Moker.\"    \"Then why did he shoot at me?\"    \"That was a mistake,\" explained Tom, \"and I apologize to you for  it.\"    \"Humph! A lot of good that would do me, if I'd been killed!\"  muttered the miser. \"I'm going to sue you for this. You might have  put me in my grave.\"    \"Impossible!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Why impossible?\" demanded the visitor.    \"Because I had so set the rifle that almost the entire force of the  electrical bullet was expended in blowing apart the scarecrow figure  I made for a test,\" explained Tom. \"All that passed through your  house was a small charge, and, if it HAD hit you there would have  been no more than a little shock, such as you would feel in taking  hold of an electric battery.\"    \"How do I know this?\" asked the man cunningly. \"You say so, but for  all I know you may have wanted to kill me.\"    \"Why?\" asked Tom, trying not to laugh.    \"Oh, so you might get some of my money. Of course I ain't got none,\"  the miser went on quickly, \"but folks thinks I've got a lot, and I  have to be on the lookout all the while, or they'd murder me for  it.\"    \"I wouldn't,\" declared the young inventor. \"It was a mistake. Only  part of the spent charge passed near you. Why, if it had been a  powerful charge you would never have been able to come over here. I  set the main charge to go off inside the scarecrow, and it did so,  as you can see by looking at what's left of it,\" and he pointed to  the pile of clothes and rags.    \"How do I know this?\" insisted the miser with a leer at the two  lads.    \"Because if the charge had gone off either before or after it passed  through the figure, it would not have caused such havoc of the cloth  and straw,\" explained Tom. \"First the charge would have destroyed  the steel plate, which it passed through without even denting it.  Why, look here, I will now fire the rifle at short range, and set it  to destroy the plate. See what happens.\"    He quickly adjusted the weapon, and aimed it at the plate, which,  had again been set up on the range. This time Tom was careful to set  the gage so that even a small part of the spent charge would not go  outside the gallery.    The young inventor pressed the button, and instantly the heavy steel  plate was bent, torn and twisted as though a small sized cannon ball  had gone through it.    \"That's what the rifle will do at short range,\" said Tom. \"Don't  worry, Mr. Moker, you didn't have a narrow escape. You were in no  danger at all, though I apologize for the fright I caused you.\"    \"Humph! That's an easy way to get out of it!\" exclaimed the miser.  \"I believe I could sue you for damages, anyhow. Look at my scorched  wall paper.\"    \"Oh, I'll pay for that,\" said Tom quickly, for he did not wish to  have trouble with the unpleasant man. \"Will ten dollars be enough?\"  He knew that the whole room could be repapered for that, and he did  not believe the wall-covering was sufficiently damaged for such work  to be necessary.    \"Well, if you'll make it twelve dollars, I won't say anything more  about it,\" agreed the miser craftily, \"though it's worth thirteen  dollars, if it is a penny. Give me twelve dollars, Tom Swift, and I  won't prosecute you.\"    \"All right, twelve dollars it shall be,\" responded the young  inventor, passing over the money, and glad to be rid of the  unpleasant character.    \"And after this, just fire that gun of yours the other way,\"  suggested Mr. Moker as he went out, carefully folding the bills  which Tom had handed him.    \"Hum! that was rather queer,\" remarked Ned, after a pause.    \"It sure was,\" agreed his chum. \"This rifle will do more than I  thought it would. I'll have to be more careful. I was sure I set the  gage for two hundred feet. I'll have to invent some automatic  attachment to prevent it being discharged when the gage is set  wrong.\" Let us state here that Tom did this, and never had another  accident.    \"Well, does this end the test?\" asked Ned.    \"No, indeed. I want you to try it, while I look on,\" spoke Tom. \"We  haven't any more stuffed figures to fire at, but I'll set up some  targets."]]]
