[Illustration: The unsocial novice]    Nowhere else, perhaps, not even in his \"Floor Games\" and \"Little Wars\"  has Mr. Wells, or any other author succeeded in drawing so convincing  a picture of the possibilities of constructive play as is to be found  in those pages, all too brief, in \"The New Machiavelli\" where the play  laboratory at Bromstead is described. One can imagine the eager boy  who played there looking back across the years strong in the  conviction that it could not have been improved, and yet the picture  of a child at solitary play is not, after all, the ideal picture. Our  laboratory, while it must accommodate the unsocial novice and make  provision for individual enterprise at all ages and stages, must be  above all the place where the give and take of group play will develop  along with block villages and other community life in miniature.      FLOOR BLOCKS    In his reminiscences of his boyhood play Mr. Wells lays emphasis on  his great good fortune in possessing a special set of \"bricks\" made to  order and therefore sufficient in number for the ambitious floor games  he describes. Comparatively few adults can look back to the possession  of similar play material, and so a majority cannot realize how it  outweighs in value every other type of toy that can be provided.    Where the budget for equipment is limited, floor blocks can be cut by  the local carpenter or, in a school, by the manual training  department. The blocks in use at The Play School (see cut, p. 20) are  of white wood, the unit block being 1-3/8\" X 2-3/4\" X 5-1/2\". They  range in size from half units and diagonals to blocks four times the  unit in length (22\").    [Illustration: The Hill Floor Blocks at the Gregory Avenue School]    At present there is but one set of blocks on the market that  corresponds to the one Mr. Wells describes. These are the \"_Hill Floor  Blocks_,\" manufactured and sold by A. Schoenhut & Co., of  Philadelphia. They are of hard maple and come in seven sizes, from 3\"  squares to oblongs of 24\", the unit block being 6\" in length. There  are 680 pieces in a set. Half and quarter sets are also obtainable.  They are the invention of Professor Patty Smith Hill of Teachers  College, Columbia University, and are used in The Teachers College  Kindergarten and in many other schools.    [Illustration: Useful alike to builders and cabinet makers]    [Illustration: Advanced research in Peg-Lock construction]    The School of Childhood at the University of Pittsburgh makes use of  several varieties of blocks, some of commercial manufacture, others  cut to order. The list given is as follows:[C]    A. Nest of blocks.    B. Large blocks made to order of hard maple in five sizes:        Cubes, 5\" X 5\".        Oblongs, 2-1/2\" X 5\" X 10\".        Triangular prisms made by cutting cube diagonally into two and          four parts.        Pillars made by cutting oblongs into two parts.        Plinths made by cutting oblongs into two parts.        Light weight 12\" boards, 3'-0\" to 7'-0\" long.    C. Froebel's enlarged fifth and sixth gifts.    D. Stone Anchor blocks.    E. Architectural blocks for flat forms.    F. Peg-Lock blocks.    As children become more dexterous and more ambitious in their block  construction, the _Peg-Lock Blocks_ will be found increasingly  valuable. These are a type of block unknown to Mr. Wells, but how he  would have revelled in the possession of a set! They are manufactured  by the Peg-Lock Block Co. of New York. Cut on a smaller scale than the  other blocks described, they are equipped with holes and pegs, by  which they may be securely joined. This admits of a type of  construction entirely outside the possibilities of other blocks. They  come in sets of varying sizes and in a great variety of shapes. The  School of Childhood uses them extensively, as does The Play School.    [Footnote C: See University of Pittsburgh Bulletin, \"Report of the  Experimental Work in the School of Childhood.\"]    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*      FLOOR TOYS    The \"Do-with Toys\" shown in the accompanying cuts were designed by  Miss Caroline Pratt some years ago to meet the need generally felt by  devotees of the play laboratory of a consistent series of toys to be  used with floor blocks. For if the market of the present day can offer  something more adequate in the way of blocks than was generally  available in Mr. Wells' boyhood, the same is not true when it comes to  facilities for peopling and stocking the resulting farms and  communities that develop.    Mr. Wells tells us that for his floor games he used tin soldiers and  such animals as he could get--we know the kind, the lion smaller than  the lamb, and barnyard fowl doubtless overtopping the commanding  officer. Such combinations have been known to children of all  generations and play of the kind Mr. Wells describes goes on in spite  of the inconsistency of the materials supplied.    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    But when we consider fostering such play, and developing its  possibilities for educational ends, the question arises whether this  is the best provision that can be made, or if the traditional  material could be improved, just as the traditions concerning blocks  are being improved.    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    A few pioneers have been experimenting in this field for some years  past. No one of them is ready with final conclusions but among them  opinion is unanimous that constructive play is stimulated by an  initial supply of consistent play material calculated to suggest  supplementary play material of a kind children can manufacture for  themselves.    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    Blocks are of course the most important type of initial material to be  provided; beyond this the generally accepted hypothesis is embodied in  the \"Do-with\" series which provides, first a doll family of  proportions suited to block houses, then a set of farm animals and  carts, then a set of wild animals, all designed on the same size  scale, of construction simple enough to be copied at the bench, and  suggesting, each set after its kind, a host of supplementary toys,  limited in variety and in numbers only by the experience of the child  concerned and by his ability to construct them.    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    This working hypothesis for the selection of toys is as yet but little  understood either by those who buy or those who sell play materials.  The commercial dealer declares with truth that there is too little  demand to justify placing such a series on the market. Not only does  he refuse to make \"Do-withs\" but he provides no adequate substitutes.  His wooden toys are merely wooden ornaments without relation to any  series and without playability, immobile, reasonless, for the  philosophy of the play laboratory is quite unknown to the makers of  play materials, while those who buy are guided almost entirely by  convention and have no better standard by which to estimate what  constitutes their money's worth.    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    On the other hand enthusiasts raise the question, why supply any toys?  Is it not better for children to make all their toys? And as Miss  Pratt says, \"getting ready for play is mistaken for play itself.\"    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    [Illustration: Small wooden toy.]*    Too much \"getting ready\" kills real play, and if our purpose is to  foster and enrich the actual activity, we must understand the subtle  value of initial play materials, of having at hand ready for the  promptings of play impulse the necessary foundation stones on which a  superstructure of improvisation can be reared.    [Illustration: Transportation Toys]    [Illustration: A trunk line]    When by hook or crook the devotees of floor games have secured a  population and live stock for their block communities, then, as Mr.  Wells reminds us, comes commerce and in her wake transportation  problems to tax the inventive genius of the laboratory.    Simple transportation toys are the next need, and suitable ones can  generally, though not always, be obtained in the shops. A few  well-chosen pieces for initial material will soon be supplemented by  \"Peg-lock\" or bench-made contrivances.    For railroad tracks the block supply offers possibilities better  adapted to the ages we are considering than any of the elaborate rail  systems that are sold with the high-priced mechanical toys so  fascinating to adult minds. Additional curved blocks corresponding to  the unit block in width and thickness are a great boon to engineers,  for what is a railroad without curves!    Transportation toys can be perfectly satisfactory when not made  strictly to scale. Indeed, the exigencies of the situation generally  demand that realists be satisfied with rather wide departures from the  general rule. Train service, however, should accommodate at least one  passenger to a car.    [Illustration: Play area.]*      LARGE AND SMALL SCALE TOYS    The floor scheme pictured here is a good illustration of our  principles of selection applied to toys of larger scale. The dolls,  the tea set, the chairs are from the toy shop. The little table in the  foreground, and the bed are bench made. The bedding is of home  manufacture, the jardiniere too, is of modelling clay, gaily painted  with water colors. The tea table and stove are improvised from blocks  as is the bath room, through the door of which a block \"tub\" may be  seen. The screen used as a partition at the back is one of the Play  School \"properties\" with large sheets of paper as panels. (See cut p.  20.)    There are some important differences, however, between the content of  a play scheme like this and one of the kind we have been considering  (see cut page 30). These result from the size and character of the  initial play material, for dolls like these invite an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#3)"],[1,"Hezekiah; What  Threatenings Rabshakeh Made To Hezekiah When Sennacherib Was Gone  Against The Egyptians; How Isaiah The Prophet Encouraged Him; How  Sennacherib Having Failed Of Success In Egypt, Returned Thence To  Jerusalem; And How Upon His Finding His Army Destroyed, He Returned  Home; And What Befell Him A Little Afterward.
