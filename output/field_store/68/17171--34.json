The following is related in the memoirs of Mary Somerville. When a girl  she and her brother had coaxed their timid mother to accompany them for  a sail. The day was sunny, but a stiff breeze was blowing, and presently  the boat began to toss and roll. \"George,\" Mrs. Fairfax called to the  man in charge, \"this is an awful storm! I fear we are in great danger;  mind how you steer; remember I trust in you!\" He replied, \"Dinna trust  in me, leddy; trust in God Almighty.\" In terror the lady exclaimed,  \"Dear me, is it come to that!\" To _that_ it ought to come on the day of  marriage quite as much as on the day of death. It is not only in times  of danger and distress that we want God's presence, but in the time of  our well-being, when all goes merry as a marriage bell. Live away from  Him, and the happiness you enjoy to-day may become your misery  to-morrow.          CHAPTER II.    TO BE OR NOT TO BE--MARRIED?         \"A bitter and perplexed 'What shall I do?'\"--_Coleridge._      \"Then, why pause with indecision    When bright angels in thy vision    Beckon thee to fields Elysian?\"--_Longfellow._      To be or not to be--married? That is the question that may occur to  readers of the last chapter. If so much precaution and preparation are  necessary to ensure a harmless, not to say a happy marriage, is the game  worth the candle? Is it not better for the unmarried to cultivate the  contented state of mind of that old Scotch lady who said, \"I wadna gie  my single life for a' the double anes I ever saw\"?    The controversy as to whether celibacy or wedlock be the happier state  is a very old one, perhaps as old as what may be called the previous  question--whether life itself be worth living. Some people are very  ingenious in making themselves miserable, no matter in what condition  of life they find themselves; and there are a sufficient number of  querulous celibates as well as over-anxious married people in the world  to make us see the wisdom of the sage's words: \"Whichever you do,  whether you marry or abstain, you will repent.\" If matrimony has more  pleasures and celibacy fewer pains, if loving be \"a painful thrill, and  not to love more painful still,\" it is impossible exactly to balance the  happiness of these two states, containing respectively more pleasure and  more pain, and less pleasure and less pain. \"If hopes are dupes, fears  may be liars.\"    It has been said of the state of matrimony that those who are in desire  to get out, and those who are out, wish to enter. The more one thinks on  the matter in this spirit, the more one becomes convinced that the  Scotch minister was by no means an alarmist who thus began an extempore  marriage service: \"My friends, marriage is a blessing to a few, a curse  to many, and a great uncertainty to all. Do ye venture?\" After a pause,  he repeated with great emphasis, \"Do ye venture?\" No objection being  made to the venture, he then said, \"Let's proceed.\"    With the opinion of this Scotch minister we may compare that of Lord  Beaconsfield: \"I have often thought that all women should marry, and no  men.\" The Admiral of Castile said, that \"he who marries a wife and he  who goes to war must necessarily submit to everything that may happen.\"  There will, however, always be young men and maidens who believe that  nothing can happen in matrimony that is worse than never to be married  at all.    When Joseph Alleine, who was a great student, married, he received a  letter of congratulation from an old college friend, who said that he  had some thoughts of following his example, but wished to be wary, and  would therefore take the freedom of asking him to describe the  inconveniences of a married life. Alleine replied, \"Thou would'st know  the inconveniences of a wife, and I will tell thee. First of all,  whereas thou risest constantly at four in the morning, or before, she  will keep thee till six; secondly, whereas thou usest to study fourteen  hours in the day, she will bring thee to eight or nine; thirdly, whereas  thou art wont to forbear one meal at least in the day for thy studies,  she will bring thee to thy meat. If these are not mischief enough to  affright thee, I know not what thou art.\" Most people will think that  such \"inconveniences of a wife\" are the strongest arguments in her  favour. Nearly all men, but especially bookish men, require the healthy  common-sense influence of women to guide and sweetly order their lives.  If we make fools of ourselves with them, we are even greater fools  without them.    With whatever luxuries a bachelor may be surrounded, he will always find  his happiness incomplete unless he has a wife and children to share it.    Who does not sympathize with Leigh Hunt? When in prison he wrote to the  governor requesting that \"his wife and children might be allowed to be  with him in the daytime: that his happiness was bound up in them, and  that a separation in respect of abode would be almost as bad to him as  tearing his body asunder.\"    To be, or not to be--married? This is one of those questions in  reference to which the speculative reason comes to no certain  conclusion. _Solvitur ambulando._ It has nearly distracted some men,  whose minds were sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought. They have  almost died of indecision, like the donkey between two exactly similar  bundles of hay. An individual of this description, who was well known to  the writer, after dropping into a letter-pillar a proposal to a young  lady, was seen a few moments afterwards endeavouring to extract with a  stick the precious document. Failing in his attempt, the wretched mortal  walked round and round the pillar, tortured with the recurrence of  reasons against matrimony which he had lately argued away. Fortunately  for both parties the lady refused the tempting offer.    And yet this hesitating lover was, perhaps, but a type of many young men  of the age. Nowadays, it is often said they are giving up matrimony as  if it were some silly old habit suited only to their grandfathers and  grandmothers. The complaint is an old one. It was brought against pagan  youths more than eighteen hundred years ago, and yet the world has got  along. But can all the blame be justly thrown upon the one sex to the  exclusion of the other? Have thoughtless extravagance and ignorance of  household economy on the part of the ladies no share in deterring the  men from making so perilous a venture?    It is said that years ago in Burmah the ladies of the Court met in  formal parliament to decide what should be done to cure the increasing  aversion of young men to marriage. Their decision was a wise one. They  altered, by an order from the palace, the style of dress to be worn by  all honest women, reduced the ornaments to be assumed by wives to the  fewest and simplest possible, and ordained that at a certain age women  should withdraw from the frivolities of fashion and of the fashionable  world. Success was the result, and young Burmah went up in a body to the  altar.    Robert Burton, in his very quaint and interesting \"Anatomy of  Melancholy,\" gives an abstract of all that may be said \"to mitigate the  miseries of marriage,\" by Jacobus de Voragine. \"Hast thou means? thou  hast none to keep and increase it. Hast none? thou hast one to help to  get it. Art in prosperity? thine happiness is doubled. Art in adversity?  she'll comfort, assist, bear a part of thy burden to make it more  tolerable. Art at home? she'll drive away melancholy. Art abroad? she  looks after thee going from home, wishes for thee in thine absence, and  joyfully welcomes thy return. There's nothing delightsome without  society, no society so sweet as matrimony. The band of conjugal love is  adamantine. The sweet company of kinsmen increaseth, the number of  parents is doubled, of brothers, sisters, nephews. Thou art made a  father by a fair and happy issue. Moses curseth the barrenness of  matrimony--how much more a single life!\" \"All this,\" says Burton, \"is  true; but how easy a mater is it to answer quite opposite! To exercise  myself I will essay. Hast thou means? thou hast one to spend it. Hast  none? thy beggary is increased. Art in prosperity? thy happiness is  ended. Art in adversity? like Job's wife, she'll aggravate thy misery,  vex thy soul, make thy burden intolerable. Art at home? she'll scold  thee out of doors. Art abroad? If thou be wise, keep thee so; she'll  perhaps graft horns in thine absence, scowl on thee coming home.  Nothing gives more content than solitariness, no solitariness like this  of a single life. The band of marriage is adamantine--no hope of loosing  it; thou art undone. Thy number increaseth; thou shalt be devoured by  thy wife's friends. Paul commends marriage, yet he prefers a single  life. Is marriage honourable? What an immortal crown belongs to  virginity! 'Tis a hazard both ways, I confess, to live single, or to  marry; it may be bad, it may be good; as it is a cross and calamity on  the one side, so 'tis a sweet delight, an incomparable happiness, a  blessed estate, a most unspeakable benefit, a sole content, on the  other--'tis all in the proof.\"    In balancing this question Lord Bacon takes higher ground, and thinks of  the effect of marriage and celibacy on a man in his public capacity. \"He  that hath wife and children hath given hostages to Fortune, for they are  impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.  Certainly the best works, and of the greatest merit for the public, have  proceeded from the unmarried or childless men, which, both in affection  and means, have married and endowed the public. Yet it were great reason  that those that have children should have greatest care of future times,  unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges.

Waste from markets,  hotels, cafes and households should be collected in covered metal  receptacles and frequently emptied. Garbage should never be dumped in or  near towns, but should be utilized or promptly destroyed by fire.    Rats find abundant food in country slaughterhouses; reform in the  management of these is badly needed. Such places are centers of rat  propagation. It is a common practice to leave offal of slaughtered  animals to be eaten by rats and swine, and this is the chief means of  perpetuating trichinae in pork. The law should require that offal be  promptly cremated or otherwise disposed of. Country slaughterhouses  should be as cleanly and as constantly inspected as abattoirs.    Another important source of rat food is found in remnants of lunches  left by employees in factories, stores, and public buildings. This food,  which alone is sufficient to attract and sustain a small army of rats,  is commonly left in waste baskets or other open receptacles. Strictly  enforced rules requiring all remnants of food to be deposited in covered  metal vessels would make trapping far more effective.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Guillotine trap made entirely of metal.]    Military training camps, unless subjected to rigid discipline in the  matter of disposal of garbage and waste, soon become centers of rat  infestation. Waste from camps, deposited in covered metal cans and  collected daily, should be removed far from the camp itself and either  burned or utilized in approved modern ways.          DESTROYING RATS AND MICE.      The Biological Survey has made numerous laboratory and field experiments  with various agencies for destroying rats and mice. The results form the  chief basis for the following recommendations:      TRAPS.    Owing to their cunning, it is not always easy to clear rats from  premises by trapping; if food is abundant, it is impossible. A few  adults refuse to enter the most innocent-looking trap. And yet trapping,  if persistently followed, is one of the most effective ways of  destroying the animals.    =Guillotine trap.=--For general use the improved modern traps with a  wire fall released by a baited trigger and driven by a coiled spring  have marked advantages over the old forms, and many of them may be used  at the same time. These traps, sometimes called \"guillotine\" traps, are  of many designs, but the more simply constructed are preferable.  Probably those made entirely of metal are the best, as they are more  durable. Traps with tin or sheet-metal bases are not recommended.    Guillotine traps of the type shown in figure 5 should be baited with  small pieces of Vienna sausage (Wienerwurst) or fried bacon. A small  section of an ear of corn is an excellent bait if other grain is not  present. The trigger wire should be bent inward to bring the bait into  proper position for the fall to strike the rat in the neck, as shown in  figure 6.    Other excellent baits for rats and mice are oatmeal, toasted cheese,  toasted bread (buttered), fish, fish offal, fresh liver, raw meat, pine  nuts, apples, carrots, and corn, and sunflower, squash, or pumpkin  seeds. Broken fresh eggs are good bait at all seasons, and ripe  tomatoes, green cucumbers, and other fresh vegetables are very tempting  to the animals in winter. When seed, grain, or meal is used with a  guillotine trap, it is put on the trigger plate, or the trigger wire may  be bent outward and the bait placed directly under it.    Oatmeal (rolled oats) is recommended as a bait for guillotine traps made  with wooden base and trigger plate (fig. 7). These traps are especially  convenient to use on ledges or other narrow rat runs or at the openings  of rat burrows. They are often used without bait.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Method of baiting guillotine trap.]    A common mistake in trapping for rats and mice is to use only one or two  traps when dozens are needed. For a large establishment hundreds of  traps may be used to advantage, and a dozen is none too many for an  ordinary barn or dwelling infested with rats. House mice are less  suspicious than rats and are much more easily trapped. Small guillotine  traps baited with oatmeal will soon rid an ordinary dwelling of the  smaller pests.    =Cage trap.=--When rats are abundant, the large French wire cage traps  may be used to advantage. They should be made of stiff wire, well  reinforced. Many of those sold in stores are useless, because a  full-grown rat can bend the light wires apart and so escape.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Guillotine trap with wooden base and trigger  plate.]    Cage traps may be baited and left open for several nights until the rats  are accustomed to enter them to obtain food. They should then be closed  and freshly baited, when a larger catch may be expected, especially of  young rats (fig. 8). As many as 25, and even more, partly grown rats  have been taken at a time in one of these traps. It is better to cover  the trap than to leave it exposed. A short board should be laid on the  trap and an old cloth or bag or a bunch of hay or straw thrown  carelessly over the top. Often the trap may be placed with the entrance  opposite a rat hole and fitting it so closely that rats can not pass  through without entering the trap. If a single rat is caught it may be  left in the trap as a decoy to others.    Notwithstanding the fact that sometimes a large number of rats may be  taken at a time in cage traps, a few good guillotine traps intelligently  used will prove more effective in the long run.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Cage trap with catch of rats.]    =Figure-4 trigger trap.=--The old-fashioned box trap set with a  figure-4 trigger is sometimes useful to secure a wise old rat that  refuses to be enticed into a modern trap. Better still is a simple  deadfall--a flat stone or a heavy plank--supported by a figure-4  trigger. An old rat will go under such a contrivance to feed without  fear.    =Steel trap.=--The ordinary steel trap (No. 0 or 1) may sometimes be  satisfactorily employed to capture a rat. The animal is usually caught  by the foot, and its squealing has a tendency to frighten other rats.  The trap may be set in a shallow pan or box and covered with bran or  oats, care being taken to have the space under the trigger pan free of  grain. This may be done by placing a very little cotton under the  trigger and setting as lightly as possible. In a narrow run or at the  mouth of a burrow a steel trap unbaited and covered with very light  cloth or tissue paper is often effective.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Barrel trap: 1, With stiff paper cover; 2, with  hinged barrel cover; _a_, stop; _b_, baits.]    The best bait usually is food of a kind that the rats and mice do not  get in the vicinity. In a meat market, vegetables or grain should be  used; in a feed store, meat. As far as possible food other than the bait  should be inaccessible while trapping is in progress. The bait should be  kept fresh and attractive, and the kind changed when necessary. Baits  and traps should be handled as little as possible.    [Illustration: FIG. 10--Pit trap. _aa_, Rat run; _bb_, cover; _cc_,  position of weights; _dd_, rods on which covers turn.]    =Barrel trap.=--About 60 years ago a writer in the Cornhill Magazine  gave details of a trap, by means of which it was claimed that 3,000 rats  were caught in a warehouse in a single night. The plan involved tolling  the rats to the place and feeding them for several nights on the tops of  barrels covered with coarse brown paper. Afterwards a cross was cut in  the paper, so that the rats fell into the barrel (fig. 9 (1)). Many  variations of the plan, but few improvements upon it, have been  suggested by agricultural writers since that time. Reports are  frequently made of large catches of rats by means of a barrel fitted  with a light cover of wood, hinged on a rod so as to turn with the  weight of a rat (fig. 9 (2)).    =Pit trap.=--A modification of the barrel trap is the pit trap (fig.  10). This consists of a stout narrow box sunk in the ground so that the  top is level with the rat run. It is fixed with a cover of light wood or  metal in two sections, the sections fitting nicely inside the box and  working independently. They turn on rods, to which they are fastened.  They are weighted near the ends of the box and so adjusted that they  swing easily. An animal stepping upon the cover beyond the rods is  precipitated into the box, while the cover immediately swings back to  its place. Besides rats, the trap is well adapted to capture larger  animals, as minks, raccoons, opossums, and cats. It is especially useful  to protect poultry yards, game preserves, and the like. The trap should  be placed along the fence outside the yard, and behind a shelter of  boards or brush that leans against the fence.    =Fence and battue.=--In the rice fields of the Far East the natives  build numerous piles of brush and rice straw, and leave them for several  days until many rats have taken shelter in them. A portable bamboo  inclosure several feet in height is then set up around each pile in  succession and the straw and brush are thrown out over the top, while  dogs and men kill the trapped rodents. Large numbers are destroyed in  this way, and the plan with modifications may be utilized in America  with satisfactory results. A wire netting of fine mesh may be used for  the inclosure. The scheme is applicable at the removal of grain, straw,  or haystacks, as well as brush piles.    In a large barn near Washington, a few years ago, piles of unhusked corn  were left in the loft and were soon infested with rats. A wooden pen was  set down surrounding the piles in turn and the corn thrown out until  dogs were able to get at the rats. In this way several men and dogs  killed 500 rats in a single day.
