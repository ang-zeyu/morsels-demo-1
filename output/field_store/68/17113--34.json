(#3)"],[1,"on the  paper; and though every glance at the sea told us that with daylight no  human strength could prevail against it, it added to our uncomfortable  feelings to know that it would be nearly night when the crisis arrived.  We had but one consolation--there were no women or children on board.  All were able-bodied men, capable of doing all that men could do in a  struggle for life. But, fortunately for the reader of these pages, to  say nothing of the relief to ourselves, at one o'clock the wind veered;  we got on a little canvass; the good ship struggled for her life; by  degrees she turned her back upon danger, and at night we were again on  our way rejoicing.    On the twenty-seventh we furled sails off the port of Sisal. Five  vessels were at anchor, an extraordinary circumstance for Sisal, and  fortunate for us, because otherwise, as our captain had never been  there before, though carefully looking for it, we might not have been  able to find it. Our anchorage ground was on the open coast, two or  three miles from land, at which distance it was necessary to keep, lest  we should be driven ashore in case of a norther. Captain Scholefield,  in fact, before he had discharged his cargo, was obliged to slip his  cables and put to sea, and did not get back to his anchorage ground in  nine days.    It was only four o'clock in the afternoon, but, by the regulations of  the port, no passenger could land until the vessel had been visited by  the health and custom-house officers. We looked out till dark, and long  after the moon rose, but no notice whatever was taken of us, and, with  no very amiable feelings toward the lazy officials, we turned in again  on board.    In the morning, when we went on deck, we saw anchored under our stern  the brig Lucinda, in which we had thought of taking passage; she had  sailed from New-York four days after we did, and arrived during the  night.    Very soon we saw coming off toward us the separate canoes of the health  and custom-house officers. We were boarded by a very little man with a  very big mustache, who was seasick before he mounted the deck, and in a  few minutes betook himself to a berth. The preliminaries, however, were  soon settled, and we went ashore. All disposition we might have had to  complain the night before ceased on landing. Our former visit was not  forgotten. The account of it had been translated and published, and, as  soon as the object of our return was known, every facility was given  us, and all our trunks, boxes, and multifarious luggage were passed  without examination by the custom-house officers.    The little town of Sisal had not increased either in houses or  inhabitants, and did not present any additional inducements to remain  in it. The same afternoon we sent off our luggage in a carreta for  Merida, and the next morning started in calezas ourselves.    From the suburbs of the town the plain was inundated, and for more than  a mile our horses were above their knees in water. When we passed  before, this ground was dry, parched, and cracking open. It was now the  last of the rainy season, and the great body of water, without any  stream by which to pass off, was drying up under a scorching sun, to  leave the earth infected with malaria.    We had arrived in the fulness of tropical vegetation; the stunted trees  along the road were in their deepest green, and Dr. Cabot opened to us  a new source of interest and beauty. In order to begin business at  once, he rode in the first caleza alone, and before he had gone far, we  saw the barrel of his gun protrude on one side, and a bird fall. He had  seen at Sisal, egretes, pelicans, and ducks which were rare in  collections at home, and an oscillated wild turkey, which alone he  thought worth the voyage to that place; and now, our attention being  particularly directed to the subject, in some places the shrubs and  bushes seemed brilliant with the plumage and vocal with the notes of  birds. On the road he saw four different species which are entirely  unknown in the United States, and six others which are found only in  Louisiana and Florida, of most of which he procured specimens.    We stopped at Huncuma during the heat of the day; at dark reached  Merida, and once more rode up to the house of Dona Micaela. Coming  directly from home, we were not so much excited as when we reached it  after a toilsome and comfortless journey in Central America; but even  now it would ill become me to depreciate it, for the donna had read the  account of my former visit to Merida, and she said, with an emphasis  that covered all the rest, that the dates of arrival and departure as  therein mentioned corresponded exactly with the entries in her book.    We had arrived at Merida at an opportune moment. As on the occasion of  our first visit, it was again a season of fiesta. The fete of San  Cristoval, an observance of nine days, was then drawing to its close,  and that evening a grand _function_ was to be performed in the church  dedicated to that saint. We had no time to lose, and, after a hasty  supper, under the guidance of an Indian lad belonging to the house, we  set out for the church. Very soon we were in the main street leading to  it, along which, as it seemed, the whole population of Merida was  moving to the fete. In every house a lantern hung from the balconied  windows, or a long candle stood under a glass shade, to light them on  their way. At the head of the street was a large plaza, on one side of  which stood the church, with its great front brilliantly illuminated,  and on the platform and steps, and all the open square before it, was a  great moving mass of men, women, and children, mostly Indians, dressed  in white.    We worked our way up to the door, and found the church within a blaze  of light. Two rows of high candlesticks, with wax candles eight or ten  feet high, extended the whole length from the door to the altar. On  each side hung innumerable lamps, dotting the whole space from the  floor to the ceiling; and back at the extreme end, standing on an  elevated platform, was an altar thirty feet high, rich with silver  ornaments and vases of flowers, and hung with innumerable lamps  brilliantly burning. Priests in glittering vestments were officiating  before it, music was swelling through the corridor and arches, and the  floor of the immense church was covered with women on their knees,  dressed in white, with white shawls over their heads. Through the  entire body of the church not a man was to be seen. Near us was a bevy  of young girls, beautifully dressed with dark eyes, and their hair  adorned with flowers, sustaining, though I was now a year older and  colder, my previous impressions of the beauty of the ladies of Merida.    The chant died sway, and as the women rose from their knees, their  appearance was like the lifting of a white cloud, or spirits of air  rising to a purer world; but, as they turned toward the door, the  horizon became dusky with Indian faces, and half way up a spot rose  above the rest, black as a thunder-cloud. The whole front ranks were  Indians, except a towering African, whose face, in the cloud of white  around, shone like the last touch of Day and Martin's best.    We waited till the last passed out, and, leaving the empty church  blazing with light, with rockets fireworks, drums, and violins all  working away together on the steps, we followed the crowd.    Turning along the left side of the plaza, we entered an illuminated  street, at the foot of which, and across it, hung a gigantic cross,  also brilliantly illuminated, and apparently stopping the way. Coming  as we did directly from the church, it seemed to have some immediate  connexion with the ceremonies we had just beheld; but the crowd stopped  short of the cross, opposite a large house, also brilliantly  illuminated. The door of this house, like that of the church, was open  to all who chose to enter, or rather, at that moment, to all who could  force their way through. Waiting the motion of the mass before us, and  pressed by those behind, slowly, and with great labour, we worked our  way into the sala. This was a large room extending along the whole  front of the house, hot to suffocation, and crowded, or rather jammed,  with men and women, or gentlemen and ladies, or by whatever other names  they may be pleased to be called, clamorous and noisy as Bedlam let  loose. For some time it was impossible for us to form any idea of what  was going on. By degrees we were carried lengthwise through the sala,  at every step getting elbowed, stamped upon, and occasionally the rim  of a straw hat across the nose, or the puff of a paper cigar in the  eyes. Very soon our faces were trickling with tears, which there was no  friendly hand to wipe away, our own being pinned down to our sides.    On each side of the sala was a rude table, occupying its whole length,  made of two rough boards, and supporting candles stuck in little tin  receivers, about two feet apart. Along the tables were benches of the  same rough materials, with men and women, whites, Mestizoes, and  Indians, all sitting together, as close as the solidity and resistance  of human flesh would permit, and seemingly closer than was sufferable.  Every person at the table had before him or her a paper about a foot  square, covered with figures in rows, and a small pile of grains of  corn, and by its side a thumping stick some eighteen inches long, and  one in diameter; while, amid all the noise, hubbub, and confusion, the  eyes of all at the tables were bent constantly upon the papers before  them. In that hot place, they seemed like a host of necromancers and  witches, some of the latter young and extremely pretty, practising the  black art.    By degrees we were passed out into the corridor, and here we were  brought to a dead stand. Within arm's length was an imp of a boy,  apparently the ringleader in this nocturnal orgy, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#3)"],[1,"argument?    It seemed that G. H. Q.--mysterious people in a mysterious place--were  drawing up rules for war correspondence and censorship; altering rules  made the day before, formulating new rules for to-morrow, establishing  precedents, writing minutes, initialing reports with, \"Passed to you,\"  or, \"I agree,\" written on the margin. The censors who lived with us and  traveled with us and were our friends, and read what we wrote before the  ink was dry, had to examine our screeds with microscopic eyes and with  infinite remembrance of the thousand and one rules. Was it safe to  mention the weather? Would that give any information to the enemy?  Was it permissible to describe the smell of chloride-of-lime in the  trenches, or would that discourage recruiting? That description of  the traffic on the roads of war, with transport wagons, gun-limbers,  lorries, mules--how did that conflict with Rule No. 17a (or whatever it  was) prohibiting all mention of movements of troops?    One of the censors working late at night, with lines of worry on his  forehead and little puckers about his eyes, turned to me with a queer  laugh, one night in the early days. He was an Indian Civil Servant, and  therefore, by every rule, a gentleman and a charming fellow.    \"You don't know what I am risking in passing your despatch! It's too  good to spoil, but G. H. Q. will probably find that it conveys accurate  information to the enemy about the offensive in 1925. I shall get the  sack--and oh, the difference to me!\"    It appeared that G. H. Q. was nervous of us. They suggested that our  private letters should be tested for writing in invisible ink between  the lines. They were afraid that, either deliberately for some  journalistic advantage, or in sheer ignorance as \"outsiders,\" we might  hand information to the enemy about important secrets. Belonging to  the old caste of army mind, they believed that war was the special  prerogative of professional soldiers, of which politicians and people  should have no knowledge. Therefore as civilians in khaki we were hardly  better than spies.    The Indian Civil Servant went for a stroll with me in the moonlight,  after a day up the line, where young men were living and dying in dirty  ditches. I could see that he was worried, even angry.    \"Those people!\" he said.    \"What people?\"    \"G. H. Q.\"    \"Oh, Lord!\" I groaned. \"Again?\" and looked across the fields of corn  to the dark outline of a convent on the hill where young officers were  learning the gentle art of killing by machine-guns before their turn  came to be killed or crippled. I thought of a dead boy I had seen that  day--or yesterday was it?--kneeling on the fire-step of a trench, with  his forehead against the parapet as though in prayer... How sweet was  the scent of the clover to-night! And how that star twinkled above the  low flashes of gun-fire away there in the salient.    \"They want us to waste your time,\" said the officer. \"Those were the  very words used by the Chief of Intelligence--in writing which I have  kept. 'Waste their time!'... I'll be damned if I consider my work is to  waste the time of war correspondents. Don't those good fools see that  this is not a professional adventure, like their other little wars; that  the whole nation is in it, and that the nation demands to know what its  men are doing? They have a right to know.\"          IV      Just at first--though not for long--there was a touch of hostility  against us among divisional and brigade staffs, of the Regulars, but  not of the New Army. They, too, suspected our motive in going to their  quarters, wondered why we should come \"spying around,\" trying to \"see  things.\" I was faintly conscious of this one day in those very early  times, when with the officer who had been a ruler in India I went to a  brigade headquarters of the 1st Division near Vermelles. It was not easy  nor pleasant to get there, though it was a summer day with fleecy clouds  in a blue sky. There was a long straight road leading to the village of  Vermelles, with a crisscross of communication trenches on one side,  and, on the other, fields where corn and grass grew rankly in abandoned  fields. Some lean sheep were browsing there as though this were Arcady  in days of peace. It was not. The red ruins of Vermelles, a mile or  so away, were sharply defined, as through stereoscopic lenses, in the  quiver of sunlight, and had the sinister look of a death-haunted place.  It was where the French had fought their way through gardens, walls,  and houses in murderous battle, before leaving it for British troops to  hold. Across it now came the whine of shells, and I saw that shrapnel  bullets were kicking up the dust of a thousand yards down the straight  road, following a small body of brown men whose tramp of feet raised  another cloud of dust, like smoke. They were the only representatives of  human life--besides ourselves--in this loneliness, though many men must  have been in hiding somewhere. Then heavy \"crumps\" burst in the fields  where the sheep were browsing, across the way we had to go to the  brigade headquarters.    \"How about it?\" asked the captain with me. \"I don't like crossing that  field, in spite of the buttercups and daisies and the little frisky  lambs.\"    \"I hate the idea of it,\" I said.    Then we looked down the road at the little body of brown men. They were  nearer now, and I could see the face of the officer leading them--a boy  subaltern, rather pale though the sun was hot. He halted and saluted my  companion.    \"The enemy seems to have sighted our dust, sir. His shrapnel is  following up pretty closely. Would you advise me to put my men under  cover, or carry on?\"    The captain hesitated. This was rather outside his sphere of influence.  But the boyishness of the other officer asked for help.    \"My advice is to put your men into that ditch and keep them there until  the strafe is over.\" Some shrapnel bullets whipped the sun-baked road as  he spoke.    \"Very good, sir.\"    The men sat in the ditch, with their packs against the bank, and wiped  the sweat off their faces. They looked tired and dispirited, but not  alarmed.    In the fields behind them--our way--the 4.2's (four--point-twos) were  busy plugging holes in the grass and flowers, rather deep holes, from  which white smoke-clouds rose after explosive noises.    \"With a little careful strategy we might get through,\" said the captain.  \"There's a general waiting for us, and I have noticed that generals are  impatient fellows. Let's try our luck.\"    We walked across the wild flowers, past the sheep, who only raised their  heads in meek surprise when shells came with a shrill, intensifying  snarl and burrowed up the earth about them. I noticed how loudly and  sweetly the larks were singing up in the blue. Several horses lay dead,  newly killed, with blood oozing about them, and their entrails smoking.  We made a half-loop around them and then struck straight for the chateau  which was the brigade headquarters. Neither of us spoke now. We were  thoughtful, calculating the chance of getting to that red-brick house  between the shells. It was just dependent on the coincidence of time and  place.    Three men jumped up from a ditch below a brown wall round the chateau  garden and ran hard for the gateway. A shell had pitched quite close  to them. One man laughed as though at a grotesque joke, and fell as he  reached the courtyard. Smoke was rising from the outhouses, and there  was a clatter of tiles and timbers, after an explosive crash.    \"It rather looks,\" said my companion, \"as though the Germans knew there  is a party on in that charming house.\"    It was as good to go on as to go back, and it was never good to go back  before reaching one's objective. That was bad for the discipline of the  courage that is just beyond fear.    Two gunners were killed in the back yard of the chateau, and as we went  in through the gateway a sergeant made a quick jump for a barn as a  shell burst somewhere close. As visitors we hesitated between two ways  into the chateau, and chose the easier; and it was then that I became  dimly aware of hostility against me on the part of a number of officers  in the front hall. The brigade staff was there, grouped under the  banisters. I wondered why, and guessed (rightly, as I found) that the  center of the house might have a better chance of escape than the  rooms on either side, in case of direct hits from those things falling  outside.    It was the brigade major who asked our business. He was a tall, handsome  young man of something over thirty, with the arrogance of a Christ  Church blood.    \"Oh, he has come out to see something in Vermelles? A pleasant place for  sightseeing! Meanwhile the Hun is ranging on this house, so he may see  more than he wants.\"    He turned on his heel and rejoined his group. They all stared in my  direction as though at a curious animal. A very young gentleman--the  general's A. D. C.--made a funny remark at my expense and the others  laughed. Then they ignored me, and I was glad, and made a little study  in the psychology of men awaiting a close call of death. I was perfectly  conscious myself that in a moment or two some of us, perhaps all of us,  might be in a pulp of mangled flesh beneath the ruins of a red-brick  villa--the shells were crashing among the outhouses and in the  courtyard, and the enemy was making good shooting--and the idea did not  please me at all. At the back of my brain was Fear, and there was a  cold sweat in the palms of my hands; but I was master of myself, and  I remember having a sense of satisfaction because I had answered the  brigade major in a level voice, with a touch of his own arrogance. I saw  that these officers were afraid; that they, too, had Fear at the back of  the brain, and that their conversation and laughter were the camouflage  of the soul. The face of the young A. D. C. was flushed and he"]]]
