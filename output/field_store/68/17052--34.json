I seize my styler and write the decision down.    There is the slit in the door.    I twiddle the note and think Well nobody asked for it yet.    Suppose it is real, after all?    I remember the itchy, sweaty feeling I got yesterday and try to  picture really embarking on a thing like this, but I cannot work up  any lather today.    I begin to picture M'Clare reading my decision not to back up my own  idea.    I pick up the coin and juggle it around.    The speaker remarks When I am quite ready will I please make a note  of my decision and post it through the door.    I go on flipping the coin up and presently it drops on the floor, it  is Heads this time.    Tossing coins is a pretty feeble way to decide.    I drop the note on the floor and take another sheet and write \"YES.  Lysistrata Lee.\"    Using that name seems to make it more legal.    I slip the paper in the slit and poke till it falls through on the  other side of the door.    I am suddenly immensely hungry and dial breakfast all over again.           *       *       *       *       *    Just as I finish M'Clare's voice starts once more.    \"It's always the minor matters that cause the most difficulty. The  timing of this announcement has cost me as much thought as any aspect  of the arrangements. The trouble is that however honest you are--and  your honesty has been tested repeatedly--and however strong your  imagination--about half of your training has been devoted to  developing it--you can't possibly be sure, answering a hypothetical  question, that you are giving the answer you would choose if you knew  it was asked in dead earnest.    \"Those of you who answered the question in the negative are out of  this. They have been told that it was a test, of an experimental  nature, and have been asked to keep the whole thing a secret. They  will be returning to Earth in a few hours' time. I ask the rest of  you to think it over once again. Your decision is still private. Only  the two people who gathered you together know which members of the  class are in this ship. The list of possible helpers was compiled by a  computer. I haven't seen it myself.    \"You have a further half hour in which to make up your minds finally.  Please remember that if you have any private reservations on the  matter, or if you are secretly afraid, you may endanger us all. You  all know enough psychology to realize this.    \"If you still decide in favor of the project, write your name on a  slip of paper and post it as before. If you are not absolutely certain  about it, do nothing. Please think it over for half an hour.\"    Me, I had enough thinking. I write my name--just L. Lee--and post it  straight away.    However I cannot stop thinking altogether. I guess I think very hard,  in fact. My Subconscious insists afterwards that it did register the  plop as something came through the slit, but my Conscious failed to  notice it at all.    Hours later--my watch says twenty-five minutes but I guess the  Mass-Time has affected it--anyway I had three times too much solitary  confinement--when will they let me out of here?--there is a knock at  the door and a second later it slides apart.    I am expecting Ram or Peter so it takes me an appreciable fraction of  a moment to realize I am seeing D. J. M'Clare.    Then I remember he is back on Earth buried in Exam papers and  conclude I am having a hallucination.    This figment of my imagination says politely, \"Do you mind if I sit  down?\"    He collapses on the couch as though thoroughly glad of it.    It is a strange thing, every time I see M'Clare I am startled all over  again at how good-looking he is; seems I forget it between times which  is maybe why I never fell for him as most female students do.    However what strikes me this time is that he looks tired,  three-days-sleepless tired with worries on top.    I guess he is real, at that.    He says, \"Don't look so accusing, Lizzie, I only just got on this ship  myself.\"    This does not make sense; you cannot just arrive on a ship twenty-four  hours after it goes on Mass-Time; or can you?    M'Clare leans back and closes his eyes and inquires whether I am one  of the Morse enthusiasts?    So that is the name; I say when we get back I will learn it first  thing.    \"Well,\" says he, \"I did my best to arrange privacy for all of you;  with so many ingenious idiots on board I'm not really surprised that  they managed to circumvent me. I had to cheat and check that you  really were on the list; and I knew that whoever backed out you'd  still be on board.\"    So I should hope he might: Horrors there is my first answer screwed  up on the floor and Writing side top-most.    However he has not noticed it, he goes on \"Anyway you of all people  won't be thought to have dropped out because you were afraid.\"    I have just managed to hook my heel over the note and get it out of  sight, M'Clare has paused for an answer and I have to dredge my  Sub-threshold memories for--    WHAT?           *       *       *       *       *    M'Clare opens his eyes and says like I am enacting Last Straw, \"Have  some sense, Lizzie.\" Then in a different tone, \"Ram says he gave you  the letter half an hour ago.\"    What letter?    My brain suddenly registers a small pale patch been occupying a corner  of my retina for the last half hour; it turns out to be a letter  postmarked Excenus 23.    I disembowel it with one jerk. It is from my Dad and runs like this:         My dear Liz,         Thank you for your last letter, glad you are keeping fit and       so am I.         I just got a letter from your College saying you will get a       degree conferred on you on September 12th and parents if on       Earth will be welcome.         Well Liz this I got to see and Charlie says the same, but       the letter says too Terran Authority will not give a permit       to visit Earth just for this, so I wangled on to a       Delegation which is coming to discuss trade with the       Department of Commerce. Charlie and I will be arriving on       Earth on August 24th.         Liz it is good to think I shall be seeing you again after       four years. There are some things about your future I meant       to write to Professor M'Clare about, but now I shall be able       to talk it over direct. Please give him my regards.         Be seeing you Lizzie girl, your affectionate Dad                                                     J. X. Lee.    Dear old Dad, after all these years farming with a weather-maker on a  drydust planet I want to see his face the first time he sees real  rain.    Hell's fires and shades of darkness, I shan't be there!    M'Clare says, \"Your father wrote to me saying that he will be arriving  on Earth on 24th August. I take it your letter says the same. I came  on a dispatch boat; you can go back on it.\"    _Now_ what is he talking about? Then I get the drift.    I say, \"Look. So Dad will be on Earth before we get back. What  difference does that make?\"    \"You can't let him arrive and find you missing.\"    Well I admit to a qualm at the thought of Dad let loose on Earth  without me, but after all Uncle Charlie is a born Terrie and can keep  him in line; Hell he is old enough to look after himself anyway.    \"You met my Dad,\" I point out. \"You think J. X. Lee would want any  daughter of his backing out on a job so as to hold his hand? I can  send him a letter saying I am off on a job or a Test or whatever I  please and hold everything till I get back; what are you doing about  people's families on Earth already?\"    M'Clare says we were all selected as having families not on Earth at  present, and I must go back.    I say like Hell I will.    He says he is my official guardian and responsible for me.    I say he is just as responsible for everyone else on this ship.    I spent years and years trying to think up a remark would really get  home to M'Clare; well I have done it now.    I say, \"Look. You are tired and worried and maybe not thinking so well  just now.    \"I know this is a very risky job, don't think I missed that at all. I  tried hard to imagine it like you said over the speaker. I cannot  quite imagine dying but I know how Dad will feel if I do.    \"I did my level best to scare myself sick, then I decided it is just  plain worth the risk anyway.    \"To work out a thing like this you have to have a kind of arithmetic,  you add in everybody's feelings with the other factors, then if you  get a plus answer you forget everything else and go right ahead.    \"I am not going to think about it any more, because I added up the sum  and got the answer and upsetting my nerves won't help. I guess you  worked out the sum, too. You decided four million people were worth  risking twenty, even if they do have parents. Even if they are your  students. So they are, too, and you gave us all a chance to say No.    \"Well nothing has altered that, only now the values look different to  you because you are tired and worried and probably missed breakfast,  too.\"    Brother some speech, I wonder what got into me? M'Clare is wondering,  too, or maybe gone to sleep sitting, it is some time before he answers  me.    \"Miss Lee, you are deplorably right on one thing at least. I don't  know whether I was fit to make such a decision when I made it, but I'm  not fit now. As far as you personally are concerned....\" He trails off  looking tireder than ever, then picks up again suddenly. \"You are  again quite right, I am every bit as responsible for the other people  on board as I am for you.\"    He climbs slowly to his feet and walks out without another word.    The door is left open and I take this as an invitation to freedom and  shoot through in case it was a mistake.    No because Ram is opening doors all along the corridor and ten of  Russett's brightest come pouring out like mercury finding its own  level and coalesce in the middle of the floor.    The effect of release is such"]]]
