[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#3)"],[1,"  the nomadic portion of the Turkish peasantry. They live in caves or rudely  constructed huts, shifting their habitation at will, or upon the  exhaustion of the pasturage. Their costume is most primitive both in style  and material; the trousers and caps being made of sheepskin and the tunic  of plaited wheat-straw. In contradistinction to the Yuraks the settled  inhabitants of the country are called Turks. That term, however, which  means rustic or clown, is never used by the Turks themselves except in  derision or disdain; they always speak of themselves as \"Osmanli.\"      [Illustration: AN ANGORA SHEPHERD.]    The great length of the Angora fleece, which sometimes reaches eight  inches, is due solely to the peculiar climate of the locality. The same  goats taken elsewhere have not thriven. Even the Angora dogs and cats are  remarkable for the extraordinary length of their fleecy covering. On  nearing Angora itself, we raced at high speed over the undulating plateau.  Our zaptieh on his jaded horse faded away in the dim distance, and we saw  him no more. This was our last guard for many weeks to come, as we decided  to dispense with an escort that really retarded us. But on reaching  Erzerum, the Vali refused us permission to enter the district of Alashgerd  without a guard, so we were forced to take one.      [Illustration: 1, THE ENGLISH CONSUL AT ANGORA FEEDING HIS PETS; 2,    PASSING A CARAVAN OF CAMELS; 3, PLOWING IN ASIA MINOR.]    We were now on historic ground. To our right, on the Owas, a tributary of  the Sakaria, was the little village of Istanas, where stood the ancient  seat of Midas, the Phrygian king, and where Alexander the Great cut with  his sword the Gordian knot to prove his right to the rulership of the  world. On the plain, over which we were now skimming, the great Tatar,  Timur, fought the memorable battle with Bajazet I., which resulted in the  capture of the Ottoman conqueror. Since the time that the title of Asia  applied to the small coast-province of Lydia, this country has been the  theater for the grandest events in human history.      [Illustration: A CONTRAST.]    The old mud-houses of modern Angora, as we rolled into the city,  contrasted strongly with the cyclopean walls of its ancient fortress.  After two days in Angora we diverged from the direct route to Sivas  through Yuezgat, so as to visit the city of Kaisarieh. Through the efforts  of the progressive Vali at Angora, a macadamized road was in the course of  construction to this point, a part of which--to the town of Kirshehr--was  already completed. Although surrounded by unusual fertility and luxuriance  for an interior town, the low mud-houses and treeless streets give  Kirshehr that same thirsty and painfully uniform appearance which  characterizes every village or city in Asiatic Turkey. The mud buildings  of Babylon, and not the marble edifices of Nineveh, have served as models  for the Turkish architect. We have seen the Turks, when making the  mud-straw bricks used in house-building, scratch dirt for the purpose from  between the marble slabs and boulders that lay in profusion over the  ground. A few of the government buildings and some of the larger private  residences are improved by a coat of whitewash, and now and then the warm  spring showers bring out on the mud roofs a relieving verdure, that  frequently serves as pasture for the family goat. Everything is low and  contracted, especially the doorways. When a foreigner bumps his head, and  demands the reason for such stupid architecture, he is met with that  decisive answer, \"Adet\"--custom, the most powerful of all influences in  Turkey and the East.      [Illustration: A TURKISH FLOUR-MILL.]    Our entry into Kirshehr was typical of our reception everywhere. When we  were seen approaching, several horsemen came out to get a first look at  our strange horses. They challenged us to a race, and set a spanking pace  down into the streets of the town. Before we reached the _khan_, or inn,  we were obliged to dismount. \"Bin! bin!\" (\"Ride! ride!\") went up in a  shout. \"Nimkin deyil\" (\"It is impossible\"), we explained, in such a jam;  and the crowd opened up three or four feet ahead of us. \"Bin bocale\"  (\"Ride, so that we can see\"), they shouted again; and some of them rushed  up to hold our steeds for us to mount. With the greatest difficulty we  impressed upon our persistent assistants that they could not help us. By  the time we reached the khan the crowd had become almost a mob, pushing  and tumbling over one another, and yelling to every one in sight that \"the  devil's carts have come.\" The inn-keeper came out, and we had to assure  him that the mob was actuated only by curiosity. As soon as the bicycles  were over the threshold, the doors were bolted and braced. The crowds  swarmed to the windows. While the khanji prepared coffee we sat down to  watch the amusing by-play and repartee going on around us. Those who by  virtue of their friendship with the khanji were admitted to the room with  us began a tirade against the boyish curiosity of their less fortunate  brethren on the outside. Their own curiosity assumed tangible shape. Our  clothing, and even our hair and faces, were critically examined. When we  attempted to jot down the day's events in our note-books they crowded  closer than ever. Our fountain-pen was an additional puzzle to them. It  was passed around, and explained and commented on at length.    Our camera was a \"mysterious\" black box. Some said it was a telescope,  about which they had only a vague idea; others, that it was a box  containing our money. But our map of Asiatic Turkey was to them the most  curious thing of all. They spread it on the floor, and hovered over it,  while we pointed to the towns and cities. How could we tell where the  places were until we had been there? How did we even know their names? It  was wonderful--wonderful! We traced for them our own journey, where we had  been and where we were going, and then endeavored to show them how, by  starting from our homes and continuing always in an easterly direction, we  could at last reach our starting-point from the west. The more intelligent  of them grasped the idea. \"Around the world,\" they repeated again and  again, with a mystified expression.    Relief came at last, in the person of a messenger from Osman Beg, the  inspector-general of agriculture of the Angora vilayet, bearing an  invitation to supper. He stated that he had already heard of our  undertaking through the Constantinople press, and desired to make our  acquaintance. His note, which was written in French, showed him to be a  man of European education; and on shaking hands with him a half-hour  later, we found him to be a man of European origin--an Albanian Greek, and  a cousin of the Vali at Angora. He said a report had gone out that two  devils were passing through the country. The dinner was one of those  incongruous Turkish mixtures of sweet and sour, which was by no means  relieved by the harrowing Turkish music which our host ground out from an  antiquated hand-organ.      [Illustration: MILL IN ASIA MINOR.]    Although it was late when we returned to the khan, we found everybody  still up. The room in which we were to sleep (there was only one room) was  filled with a crowd of loiterers, and tobacco smoke. Some were playing  games similar to our chess and backgammon, while others were looking on,  and smoking the gurgling narghile, or water-pipe. The bicycles had been  put away under lock and key, and the crowd gradually dispersed. We lay  down in our clothes, and tried to lose consciousness; but the Turkish  supper, the tobacco smoke, and the noise of the quarreling gamesters, put  sleep out of the question. At midnight the sudden boom of a cannon  reminded us that we were in the midst of the Turkish Ramadan. The sound of  tramping feet, the beating of a bass drum, and the whining tones of a  Turkish bagpipe, came over the midnight air. Nearer it came, and louder  grew the sound, till it reached the inn door, where it remained for some  time. The fast of Ramadan commemorates the revelation of the Koran to the  prophet Mohammed. It lasts through the four phases of the moon. From  daylight, or, as the Koran reads, \"from the time you can distinguish a  white thread from a black one,\" no good Mussulman will eat, drink, or  smoke. At midnight the mosques are illuminated, and bands of music go  about the streets all night, making a tremendous uproar. One cannon is  fired at dusk, to announce the time to break the fast by eating supper,  another at midnight to arouse the people for the preparation of breakfast,  and still another at daylight as a signal for resuming the fast. This, of  course, is very hard on the poor man who has to work during the day. As a  precaution against oversleeping, a watchman goes about just before  daybreak, and makes a rousing clatter at the gate of every Mussulman's  house to warn him that if he wants anything to eat he must get it  instanter. Our roommates evidently intended to make an \"all night\" of it,  for they forthwith commenced the preparation of their morning meal. How it  was despatched we do not know, for we fell asleep, and were only awakened  by the muezzin on a neighboring minaret, calling to morning prayer.      [Illustration: GIPSIES OF ASIA MINOR.]    Our morning ablutions were usually made _a la_ Turk: by having water  poured upon the hands from a spouted vessel. Cleanliness is, with the  Turk, perhaps, more than ourselves, the next thing to godliness. But his  ideas are based upon a very different theory. Although he uses no soap for  washing either his person or his clothes, yet he considers himself much  cleaner than the giaour, for the reason that he uses running water  exclusively, never allowing the same particles to touch him the second  time. A Turk believes that all water is purified after running six feet.  As a test of his faith we have often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#3)"],[1,"views of       the adjacent country; 'Patrician trees' at intervals form       umbrageous alleys; water is made contributory from a hundred       mountain streams and rivulets, to form jets, cascades, and       fountains, which, infinitely varied in their 'play,' ramble       among lilies, or--it is scarcely an exaggeration to say--fling       their spray into the clouds, and descend to refresh the topmost       leaves of trees that were in their prime three centuries ago.       The most striking and original of the walks is that which leads       through mimic Alpine scenery to the great conservatory; here       Art has been most triumphant; the rocks, which, have been all       brought hither, are so skilfully combined, so richly clad in       mosses, so luxuriantly covered with heather, so judiciously       based with ferns and water-plants, that you move among or       beside them in rare delight at the sudden change which       transports you from trim parterres to the utmost wildness of       natural beauty. From these again you pass into a garden, in the       centre of which is the conservatory, always renowned, but now       more than ever, as the prototype of the famous Palace of Glass,       which, in this _Annus Mirabilis_, received under its roof six       millions of the people of all nations, tongues, and creeds. In       extent, the conservatory at Chatsworth is but a pigmy compared       with that which glorifies Hyde Park: but it is filled with the       rarest Exotics from all parts of the globe--from 'farthest       Ind,' from China, from the Himalayas, from Mexico; here you see       the rich banana, Eschol's grape hanging in ripe profusion       beneath the shadow of immense paper-like leaves; the feathery       cocoa-palm, with its head peering almost to the lofty arched       roof; the far-famed silk cotton-tree, supplying a sheet of       cream-colored blossoms, at a season when all outward vegetable       gayety is on the wane: the singular milk-tree of the       Caraccas--the fragrant cinnamon and cassia--with thousands of       other rare and little-known species of both flowers and fruits.       The Italian Garden--opposite the library windows, with its       richly colored parterres, and its clustered foliage wreathed       around the pillars which support the statues and busts       scattered among them, and hanging from one to the other with a       luxurious verdure which seems to belong to the south--is a       relief to the eye sated with the splendors of the palatial       edifice.    [Illustration: THE ROCK-WORK.]         \"The water-works, which were constructed under the direction of       M. Grillet, a French artist, were begun in 1690, when a pipe       for what was then called 'the great fountain' was laid down;       the height of twenty feet to which it threw water being, at       that time, considered sufficiently wonderful to justify the       hyperbolical language of Cotton:             '--should it break or fall, I doubt we should           Begin to reckon from the second flood.'         It was afterward elevated to fifty feet, and then to       ninety-four feet; but it is now celebrated as the most       remarkable fountain in the world; it rises to the height of two       hundred and sixty-seven feet, and has been named the _Emperor       Fountain_, in honor of the visit of the Emperor of Russia to       Chatsworth in 1844. Such is the velocity with which the water       is ejected, that it is shown to escape at the rate of one       hundred miles per minute; for the purpose of supplying it, a       reservoir, or immense artificial lake, has been constructed on       the hills, above Chatsworth, which is fed by the streams around       and the springs on the moors drains being cut for this purpose,       commencing at Humberly Brook, on the Chesterfield Road, two       miles and a half from the reservoir, which covers eight acres;       a pipe winds down the hill side, through which the water       passes; and such is its waste, that a diminution of a foot may       be perceived when the water-works have been played for three       hours. Nothing can exceed the stupendous effect of this column,       which may be seen for many miles around, shooting upwards to       the sky in varied and graceful evolutions. From this upper lake       the waterfalls are also supplied, which are constructed with so       natural an effect on the hill side, behind the water-temple,       which reminds the spectator of the glories of St. Cloud. From       the dome of this temple bursts forth a gush of water that       covers its surface, pours through the urns at its sides, and       springs up in fountains underneath, thence descending in a long       series of step-like falls, until it sinks beneath the rocks at       the base, and--after rising again to play as 'the dancing       fountain' is conveyed by drains under the garden and       park,--being emptied into the Derwent.[1] But we may not forget       that our space is limited: to describe the gardens and       conservatories of Chatsworth would occupy more pages than we       can give to the whole theme; suffice it that the taste and       liberality of the Duke of Devonshire, and the skill and       judgment of Sir Joseph Paxton, have so combined Nature and Art       in this delicious region, as to supply all the enjoyment that       may be desired or is attainable, from trees, shrubs, and       flowers seen under the happiest arrangement of countries,       classes, and colors.    [Illustration: THE GREAT CONSERVATORY.]    [Illustration: THE ITALIAN GARDEN.]         \"The erection of the present house is narrated by Lysons, who       says, the south front was begun to be rebuilt on the 12th of       April, 1687, and the great hall and staircase covered in about       the middle of April, 1690; the east front was begun in 1693,       and finished in 1700; the south gallery was pulled down and       rebuilt in 1703; in 1704, the north front was pulled down; the       west front was finished in 1706; and the whole of the building       not long afterwards completed, being about twenty years from       the time of its commencement. The architect was Mr. William       Talman, but in May, 1692, the works were surveyed by Sir       Christopher Wren.         \"On entering--the Lower Hall or Western Lodge contains some       very fine antique statuary, and fragments which deserve the       especial attention of the connoisseur. Among them are several       which were the treasured relics of Canova and Sir Henry       Englefield, and others found in Herculaneum, and presented by       the King of Naples to 'the beautiful' Duchess of Devonshire. A       corridor leads thence to the Great Hall, which is decorated       with paintings by the hand of a famous artist in his       day--Verrio--celebrated by Pope for his proficiency in       ceiling-painting. The effect of the hall is singularly good,       with its grand stair and triple arches opening to the principal       rooms. The sub-hall, behind, is embellished by a graceful       fountain, with the story of Diana and Actaeon, and the abundance       of water at Chatsworth is sufficient for it to be constantly       playing, producing an effect seldom attempted within doors. A       long gallery leads to the various rooms inhabited by the Duke,       the walls being decorated with a large number of fine pictures       by the older masters of the Flemish and Italian schools. In the       billiard-room are Landseer's famed picture of Bolton Abbey in       the Olden Time, with charming specimens of Collins, and other       British painters.    [Illustration: THE ENTRANCE HALL]         \"The chapel is richly decorated with foliage in carved       woodwork, which has been erroneously attributed to Grinling       Gibbons. It was executed by Thomas Young, who was engaged as       the principal carver in wood in 1689, and by a pupil of his,       Samuel Watson, a native of Heanor, in Derbyshire, whose claim       to the principal ornamental woodcarving at Chatsworth is set       forth in verses on his tomb in Heanor Church.         \"Over the Colonnade on the north side of the quadrangle, is a       gallery nearly one hundred feet long in which have been hung a       numerous and valuable collection of drawings by the old       masters, arranged according to the schools of art of which they       are examples. There is no school unrepresented, and as the eye       wanders over the thickly-covered wall, it is arrested by       sketches from the hands of Raffaelle, Da Vinci, Claude Poussin,       Paul Veronese, Salvator Rosa, and the other great men who have       made Art immortal. To describe these works would occupy a       volume; to study them a life; it is a glorious collection       fitly displayed.    [Illustration: THE SCULPTURE GALLERY.]         \"The old state-rooms, which form the upper floors of the south       front, occupy the same position as those which were       appropriated to the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots during her       long residence here. There is, however, but little to see of       her period; if we except some needlework at the back of a       canopy representing hunting scenes, worked by the hand of the       famous Countess of Shrewsbury, popularly known as 'Bess of       Hardwick.'         \"The gallery, ninety feet by twenty-two, originally constructed       for dancing, has been fitted up by the present Duke as a       library. Among the books which formed the original library at       Chatsworth, are several which belonged to the celebrated       Hobbes, who was many years a resident at the old hall. The       library of Henry Cavendish, and the extensive and valuable       collection at Devonshire House have aided to swell its stores.
