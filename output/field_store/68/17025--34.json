He returned to Hanover in 1816, where he lived in  comfortable independence, through the never-failing generosity of his  brother, until his death in 1821. A notice of him in a Bristol paper  says: \"Died, March 15, 1821, at Hanover, ALEXANDER HERSCHEL, Esqr., well  known to the public of Bath and Bristol as a performer and elegant  musician; and who for forty-seven years was the admiration of the  frequenters of concerts and theatres of both those cities as principal  violoncello. To the extraordinary merits of Mr. HERSCHEL was united  considerable acquirement in the superior branches of mechanics and  philosophy, and his affinity to his brother, Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL, was  not less in science than in blood.\"    We shall learn more of the sister, CAROLINA, as time goes on. Now in  these early years she was a silent and persistent child, growing up with  a feeling that she was uncared for and neglected, and lavishing all her  childish affection, as she did all that of her womanly life, on her  brother WILLIAM. Throughout her long life, \"my brother\" was WILLIAM,  \"my nephew\" _his_ son.    The brothers JACOB and WILLIAM were, with their father, members of the  band of the Guards in 1755, when the regiment was ordered to England,  and they were absent from Hanover a year.    WILLIAM (then seventeen years old) went as oboist, and out of his  scanty pay brought back to Hanover, in 1756, only one memento of his  stay--a copy of LOCKE _On the Human Understanding_.    He appears to have served with the Guard during part of the campaign of  1757. His health was then delicate, and his parents \"determined to  remove him from the service--a step attended by no small  difficulties.\"[3]    This \"removal\" was hurriedly and safely effected, so hurriedly that the  copy of LOCKE was not put in the parcels sent after him to Hamburg by  his mother; \"she, dear woman, knew no other wants than good linen and  clothing.\"    Thus, at last, the young WILLIAM HERSCHEL, the son of an oboe-player in  the King's Guard, is launched in life for himself, in the year 1757, at  the age of nineteen.    All his equipment is the \"good linen and clothing,\" a knowledge of  French, Latin, and English, some skill in playing the violin, the organ,  and the oboe, and an \"uncommon precipitancy\" in doing what there is to  be done.    A slender outfit truly; but we are not to overlook what he said of  himself on another occasion. \"I have, nevertheless, several resources in  view, and do not despair of succeeding pretty well in the end.\"    From 1757 to 1760--three years--we know nothing of his life. We can  imagine what it was. His previous visit to England had given him a good  knowledge of the language, and perhaps a few uninfluential  acquaintances. On his return he would naturally seek these out, and, by  means of his music, he could gain a livelihood. We first hear of him as  charged with the organization of the music of a corps of the militia of  Durham, under the auspices of the EARL OF DARLINGTON. \"La maniere dont  il remplit cette mission, le fit connaitre avantageusement.\"[4] The  nature of the service of these militia corps, which were then forming  all over England, is well described in the Autobiography of GIBBON.  Every county-gentleman felt constrained to serve his country,  and the regimental mess-rooms were filled with men of rank and fashion.    In 1760 we hear of him again. He has attracted the notice of those about  him.        \"About the year 1760, as MILLER[5] was dining at Pontefract with      the officers of the Durham militia, one of them, knowing his love of      music, told him they had a young German in their band as a performer      on the hautboy, who had only been a few months in England, and yet      spoke English almost as well as a native, and who was also an      excellent performer on the violin; the officer added that if MILLER      would come into another room, this German should entertain him with      a solo. The invitation was gladly accepted, and MILLER heard a solo      of GIARDINI'S executed in a manner that surprised him. He afterwards      took an opportunity of having some private conversation with the      young musician, and asked him whether he had engaged himself for any      long period to the Durham militia. The answer was, 'Only from month      to month.' 'Leave them, then,' said the organist, 'and come and live      with me. I am a single man, and think we shall be happy together;      and, doubtless, your merit will soon entitle you to a more eligible      situation.' The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and      the reader may imagine with what satisfaction Dr. MILLER      must have remembered this act of generous feeling when he hears      that this young German was HERSCHEL, the Astronomer. 'My humble      mansion,' says MILLER, 'consisted, at that time, but of two rooms.      However, poor as I was, my cottage contained a library of      well-chosen books; and it must appear singular that a foreigner who      had been so short a time in England should understand even the      peculiarities of the language so well as to fix upon SWIFT for his      favorite author.'        \"He took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at      Mr. CROPLEY'S concerts; the first violin was resigned to him; 'and      never,' says the organist, 'had I heard the concertos of CORELLI,      GEMINIANI, and AVISON, or the overtures of HANDEL performed more      chastely, or more according to the original intention of the      composers, than by Mr. HERSCHEL. I soon lost my companion; his fame      was presently spread abroad; he had the offer of pupils, and was      solicited to lead the public concerts both at Wakefield and Halifax.      A new organ for the parish church of Halifax was built about this      time, and HERSCHEL was one of the seven candidates for the      organist's place. They drew lots how they were to perform in      succession. HERSCHEL drew the third, the second fell to Dr.      WAINWRIGHT of Manchester, whose finger was so rapid that old      SNETZLER, the organ-builder, ran about the church exclaiming:      '_Te tevel! te tevel! he run over te keys like one cat; he will      not give my piphes room for to shpeak._' 'During Mr. WAINWRIGHT'S      performance,' says MILLER, 'I was standing in the middle aisle with      HERSCHEL. 'What chance have you,' said I, 'to follow this man?' He      replied, 'I don't know; I am sure fingers will not do.' On which he      ascended the organ loft, and produced from the organ so uncommon a      fulness, such a volume of slow, solemn harmony, that I could by no      means account for the effect. After this short _ex tempore_      effusion, he finished with the Old Hundredth psalm-tune, which he      played better than his opponent.        \"'_Ay, ay_,' cried old SNETZLER, '_tish is very goot, very goot      indeet; I vil luf tish man, for he gives my piphes room for to      shpeak._' Having afterwards asked Mr. HERSCHEL by what means, in the      beginning of his performance, he produced so uncommon an effect, he      replied, 'I told you fingers would not do!' and producing two pieces      of lead from his waistcoat pocket, 'one of these,' said he,      'I placed on the lowest key of the organ, and the other upon the      octave above; thus by accommodating the harmony, I produced the      effect of four hands, instead of two.'\"[6]    The dates in this extract are not so well defined as might be wished.  HERSCHEL had certainly been more than a few months in England at the  time of his meeting with Dr. MILLER, which was probably about 1760. The  appointment as organist at Halifax was in 1765, and the pupils and  public concerts must have filled up the intervening five years. During a  part of this time he lived in Leeds, with the family of Mr. BULMAN, whom  he afterwards provided with a place as clerk to the Octagon Chapel, in  his usual generous manner.    All during his life he was placing some of the less fortunate and  energetic members of his family.    We cannot be too grateful to Dr. MILLER, who, seeing his opportunity,  used it. Their frank friendship does honor to both. HERSCHEL'S  organ-playing, which no doubt had been begun when his brother was the  organist of the garrison chapel at Hanover, must have been perfected at  this time, and it was through his organ-playing that he was able to  leave the needy life in Yorkshire.    He was sure to have emerged sooner or later, but every year spared to  him as a struggling musician was a year saved to Astronomy.    During all this period, a constant correspondence was maintained  between the family at Hanover and the absent son.    Many of WILLIAM'S letters were written in English, and addressed to his  brother JACOB, and treated of such subjects as the Theory of Music, in  which he was already far advanced.    His little sister was still faithful to the memory of her _dearest_  brother, and his father, whose health was steadily declining, became  painfully eager for his return. In 1764 (April 2), he returned to  Hanover on a very brief visit. He was attached to England, he was  prospering there, and he had no inclination towards returning to a life  in Hanover. His sister says:        \"Of the joys and pleasures which all felt at this long-wished-for      meeting with my--let me say my _dearest_--brother, but a small      portion could fall to my share; for with my constant attendance at      church and school, besides the time I was employed in doing the      drudgery of the scullery, it was but seldom I could make one in the      group when the family were assembled together.        \"In the first week, some of the orchestra were invited to a concert,      at which some of my brother WILLIAM'S compositions, overtures, etc.,      and some of my eldest brother JACOB'S were performed, to the great      delight of my dear father, who hoped and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29056"],[0,"Almost A Man (#3)"],[1,"gives to the child of which this particular ovum  may form a part. Your mother is English, your father American. Their  childhood and youth were spent thousands of miles apart, and yet both  were working by the habits of their lives to create you in your peculiar  traits and talents. Are you like your parents in any of their  capabilities?\"    \"Yes, I am like mother in her love for music; you know she is a fine  musician.\"    \"Yes, and in the cultivation of her own musical ability she made it  easier for you to learn music; just as your father, in his study as an  engineer, has given you a love for mathematics.\"    \"But my grandfather and great-grandfather were engineers, and I am going  to be one, too.\"    \"It is true that you inherit from your grandparents, also, but it must  be through your parents, and they may have changed the direction of  the inheritance. This important fact you should know and remember.  You can change yourself by education so that the inheritance of your  children may be quite changed. For example, if you know that you  lack perseverance, you can, by constantly making a mighty effort to  overcome this defect, compel yourself to persevere, and this would  tend to give your children perseverance. So you see we need not  despair because we have inherited faults from our ancestors, but we  should determine all the more that we will not pass these defects on  to later generations.\"    \"I guess that is what Dr. Brice meant when he said that mother's good  care of her health had overcome in us children to a great extent the  tendency to consumption which is in her family. Nearly all my cousins on  her side die with it, but when she was a little girl her father made her  live out of doors all the time and she grew strong, and we none of us  seem to have any tendency to consumption.\"    \"You see then the value of caring for yourself in youth, not only for  your own sake but for that of your children. Your mother did not know  that she would ever have children to be benefitted by her out-door life.  But one day she met a young man who pleased her, and as they grew to  know each other better they came to love each other so that they wished  to leave home and friends and make their own home and live their united  lives separate and apart from all the rest of the world. So they were  married, as we say. Marriage is the union of one man and one woman under  the sanction of the law. This is the closest and most sacred human  relation. In this relation the _spermatozoon_ of the man unites with the  germ or _ovum_ of the woman and a new life is begun. When your parents  knew that such a little life had begun in their home they felt a great  and holy joy, and desired that every good might surround it in its  development. You were the first to come into your father's home. After  your life had begun you were still so small as not to be visible to the  naked eye, and would have been lost had you come into the world. But a  home had been prepared for you in your mother's body, where day by day  you grew and grew. The food which she ate nourished you as well as  herself. The air which she breathed was life to you as well as to her.    \"You have seen the father-bird bringing food to the mother-bird as she  sits upon her eggs and waits for the birdlings to come forth, and you  have thought it a pretty sight to watch his tender care of her. Even so  your father watched over your mother and you. He provided everything as  pleasant as possible, he removed every care from her path so that she  might be happy and so make you happy. His love for her took on a new and  strange tenderness it had not known before. And she, holding you warm  and close in the embrace of her body, thought of you and loved you. She  wondered how you would look; she dreamed of you; she fancied she could  feel the touch of your fluttering fingers; she made your little wardrobe  and with each stitch wove in some tender thought of the baby whom she  had never seen. Then one day she cried out with great anguish of body  but joy of heart, 'O my baby is coming.' Then through long hours she  suffered, going down almost to the gates of death that you might have  life. But she never murmured; in spite of all her pain and anguish of  body her very soul was full of rejoicing that soon she would hold you in  her arms. When all those hours of peril and anxiety were past and you  were laid in your mother's arms, your father came and bent over you both  with a measureless love, and looking into your little face they knew  what the Scripture meant when it said, 'And they twain shall be one  flesh,' for were not you a living fulfillment of that saying? You were a  part of each united in a living being who belonged to them both. Then  for the first time could they realize, even dimly, the yearning, tender  love of their heavenly Father who had granted to them to know by  experience his feelings towards his children.\"    Great tears had gathered in the boy's eyes as she talked, and now with  choking voice he said, \"I don't think I can ever be disobedient again,  Dr. Barrett. I did not understand it all as I do now. You know we only  hear these things talked of among the boys, and I had come to feel that  there was some reason why I ought to be ashamed of my father and mother;  but it all looks so different to me now. I wish you could talk to the  other boys as you have to me.\"    \"It may not be possible for me to do so, although I should be glad to do  it, but you can help them to think more truly on these subjects. You can  especially help them to treat women and girls with more respect than  they often do, because you can see how an injury to any girl is an  injury to the whole world.\"    \"I don't quite see that,\" said Carl.    \"You can see that if any one had injured your mother in her girlhood it  would have been an injury to all her children, can you not?\"    \"O yes.\"    \"And that injury might be passed on to future generations. There lived a  poor girl, about a hundred years ago, who was uncared for by good people  and wronged by evil ones, and to-day she is known as a 'mother of  criminals,' and no one can tell where the mischief will end. You would  feel very indignant if you knew that some one had done your mother an  injury in her girlhood, and you would feel the same way should any one  wrong your sisters.\"    \"I knocked Bill Jones down last week because he said something to my  sister Kate.\"    \"You felt a righteous anger and manifested it. Well, in all probability  you will some day marry. If so, there is in the world to-day the girl  who will be your wife. How do you want her to be treated by the boys who  are her school-companions? Do you like to think that they are rough with  her, or playing at lovering with her? Is it a pleasant thought that she  is allowing them to caress her or write her silly sentimental notes?\"    Carl's face was scarlet, but he answered bravely; \"No, it isn't.\"    The Doctor continued. \"Some day, in all likelihood, a little girl-child  will climb upon your knee and call you papa. No creature can ever be to  you what that little daughter will be. If any one should injure  her----.\"    \"I'd kill him,\" broke in Carl hotly.    \"If you feel that way, dear boy, you should remember that every girl is  some one's daughter, perhaps some one's sister, will probably be some  one's wife and some one's mother, so that all girls should be sacred to  you, treated with chivalrous courtesy and protected even as you feel you  would protect those who may belong especially to you.\"    \"But don't you believe in boys and girls being friends at all?\"    \"Most assuredly I do. Nothing is more charming than the frank  comradeship of girls and boys, and that is why I am so sorry to see them  spoil it with sentimentality. They ought to be good friends, helping  each other, having jolly good times together, but never in ways that  will bring a blush to the cheeks of either, now, or in the years to  come.\"    A rap sounded on the door and the maid entered with a note which she  gave to the doctor, who handed it to Carl, saying, \"Here is the note for  Miss Bell. I have kept you waiting a long time, but I hope it has not  been unprofitable.\"    \"Indeed it has not. I am ever so much obliged to you, I am sure.\"    \"And if you ever wish to talk to me again you will feel free to come,  will you not?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, I surely will,\" answered the lad with a frank clasp of the  hand.    \"Wait a moment,\" said the doctor, \"I have just thought of a little book  that I am sure you will be interested in reading. It is called 'A  Gateway and a Gift,' and it deals with some of the questions we have  been talking about this evening. You can lend it to some of your boy  friends if you wish.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Carl, taking the book which the doctor handed him, and  then with another \"Good night,\" he walked away in the darkness.    The note which he gave to Miss Bell the next morning read merely:    \"Don't say anything to Carl. Just wait.\"    If Miss Bell had seen a note slipped by Carl into Susie Glenn's hand an  hour later she might have thought it an evidence that the doctor's plan  had failed. But had she read the note her opinion would have been that  it had succeeded. It read:        \"Dear Susie:--It was real mean of me to write that note      yesterday. Will you forgive me? Say, Susie, I think all this      nonsense about lovers and sweethearts is silly rot, don't you?      Let's be just friends. Respectfully yours,        CARL.\"    Susie's answer was short but to the point. It read:        \"All right. Let's.        SUSIE.\"    Several months later Miss Bell and Miss Lane called again on Dr.  Barrett.    \"Have you come with another problem?\" asked the doctor.    \"No, we have come to report progress and to learn, if possible, just how  it has come about. There has been a wonderful change in the school. The  girls and boys are no less friendly, but it is"]]]
