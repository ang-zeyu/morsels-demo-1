Of the three sierran faunas, those of the  Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra de Tamaulipas have most in common.  Migration from one to the other in relative recent time may account for  the resemblance. The Sierra San Carlos may have been isolated for a  long time and interchange between its fauna and those of the other two  sierras, therefore, may have been slight.    Study of the taxonomic resemblance shows that the dividing line, in  eastern Mexico, between Nearctic and Neotropical faunas is along the  eastern base of the Sierra Madre Oriental, the southern base of the  Sierra de Tamaulipas and thence to the coast at or near Soto la Marina.          PLANT-MAMMAL RELATIONSHIPS      Merriam (1898) assigned to Tamaulipas four Life-zones. There were:  Transitional on the highest elevations of the Sierra Madre; Upper  Austral at lower elevations on the Sierra Madre; Lower Austral over  most of the state; and Tropical in the coastal areas.    Dice (1943) outlined Biotic Provinces on a map of North America and in  the northern part of Tamaulipas showed two Biotic Provinces, Tamaulipan  and Potosian. He did not show the southeastern limits of the Chihuahuan  Biotic Province nor any of the limits of the Veracruzian Biotic  Province and in text mentioned nothing about the limits of these two  provinces with reference to Tamaulipas. Later, Goldman and Moore (1946)  divided Tamaulipas in three Biotic Provinces: Tamaulipas, Sierra Madre,  and Veracruz. Still later (1949), Smith published a map of Mexican  Biotic Provinces based on the herpetofauna of the Republic. He divided  Tamaulipas among four Provinces. Two were Nearctic (Austro-oriental and  Tamaulipan) and the other two were Neotropical (Veracruzian and  Cordoban).    Leopold (1950 and 1959) recognized five principal vegetational types in  Tamaulipas as follows: Mesquite-grassland; Pine-oak Forest; Thorn  Forest; Tropical Deciduous Forest; and Desert.    For dealing with the mammals of Tamaulipas in the following accounts  the four Biotic Provinces (Tamaulipan, Potosian, Veracruzian, and  Chihuahuan) of Dice are the most useful. For dealing with types of  vegetation in the accounts that follow, Leopold's (1950) system is  employed although reference is made to other associations and  formations that have been reported in Tamaulipas.      Tamaulipan Biotic Province    This Province is recognized by most authors who have written about the  zoogeography of Mexico. It is the most extensive in the state and  includes the northern part of the Coastal Plain (see Fig. 2).    The vegetation of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province is in general  Mesquite-grassland but in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra de  Tamaulipas other types of vegetation are found.         Two formations occur in the Mesquite-grassland. The first is       the Mesquite Scrub, in which the dominant plant is the       mesquite (_Prosopis juliflora_), associated with _Cordia       boissieri_, several species of _Acacia_, and in some areas       with _Opuntia_ and _Yucca treculeana_. The dominant grasses       are of the genera _Bouteloua_ and _Andropogon_. The second       formation is the Gulf Bluestem Prairie, where species of       _Andropogon_ are the dominants on the well-drained sites.       Sloughs and depressions are occupied by cordgrass, _Spartina       spartinae_. Many areas have been invaded by mesquite and       other shrubs.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Four biotic provinces: 1 Tamaulipan; 2 Potosian;  3 Chihuahuan; 4 Veracruzian.]         Around the Sierra de Tamaulipas and in the area between it       and the Sierra San Carlos the vegetation is Thorn Forest       (Tropical Thorn Forest of Martin _et al._, 1954), in which       the dominant plants are _Acacia_, _Ichthyomethia_, _Ipomea_,       _Prosopis_, and _Cassia_. Another type of vegetation in the       Sierra de Tamaulipas is the Tropical Deciduous Forest at 300       to 700 meters elevation, the trees of which are 20 meters       high with a canopy averaging eight meters high (Martin _et       al._, _op. cit._). The common species of trees belong to the       genera _Tabebuia_, _Ipomea_, _Bombax_, and _Conzattia_.       Species of _Bursera_, _Acacia_, and _Cassia_ are less       abundant. In the low canyons _Bursera_, _Ceiba_, and       _Psidium_, draped with lianas and various epiphytes, can be       found.         The Pine-oak Formation grows above an elevation of 800       meters in the Sierra de Tamaulipas and is characterized by       _Pinus cembroides_, _P. nelsonii_, _P. teocote_, and       _Quercus arizonica_. Martin _et al._ (_op. cit._) recorded       Montane Scrub from the dry areas, between elevations of 600       and 900 meters. That scrub is formed by huisaches (_Acacia       farnesiana_) along with a few oaks and some trees of the       Tropical Deciduous Forest.         The vegetation of the Sierra San Carlos was studied by Dice       (1937) and divided into three life belts, each with several       associations. For more information about the plants of each       association and their related mammals see the publication of       the mentioned author.         Endemic mammals of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province, in the       part of it that is in Tamaulipas, are the following:       _Scalopus inflatus_; _Lepus californicus curti_;       _Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus_; _Cratogeomys castanops       tamaulipensis_; _Dipodomys ordii parvabullatus_; and       _Sigmodon hispidus solus_. Other characteristic mammals of       this Province in the state of Tamaulipas are: _Sylvilagus       floridanus connectens_; _S. audubonii parvulus_; _Lepus       californicus merriami_; _Perognathus merriami merriami_;       _Dipodomys ordii compactus_; _Orzomys melanotis carrorum_;       _Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius_; _Peromyscus boylii       ambiguus_; _Canis latrans texensis_; _C. l. microdon_; _C.       lupus monstrabilis_; _Taxidea taxus berlandieri_; _Mephitis       mephitis varians_; _Felis pardalis albescens_; _Trichechus       manatus latirostris_; and _Odocoileus virginianus texanus_.         Many other kinds of mammals occur mainly in the Tamaulipan       Province but are not listed above because they occur also in       one or more of the other provinces.         The Sierra de Tamaulipas is placed in the Tamaulipan Biotic       Province because the fauna, especially of non-flying       mammals, is closely related to that of the rest of the       Province. Nevertheless, many mammals found in this Sierra       are tropical in relationship. This is especially true of the       bats. Therefore, most of the tropical bats that occur in       Tamaulipas occur in the Veracruzian Biotic Province and in       the Sierra de Tamaulipas.      Potosian Biotic Province    This Province occupies all of the Sierra Madre Oriental and, therefore,  the southwestern part of the state.    The vegetation in general is Pine-oak Forest, in which the most common  trees are _Abies religiosa_, _Pinus flexilis_, _P. patula_, _P.  montezumae_, _P. teocote_, _Populus tremuloides_, _Juniperus  flaccida_, _Quercus arizonica_, _Q. clivicola_ and _Q. polymorpha_.         In his study of plants of the Gomez Farias area, Martin       (1958) recorded several different types of vegetation, which       in part can be placed in the Potosian Biotic Province,       especially those types that occur to the northwest of the       Cloud Forest. In addition to the Cloud Forest, Martin       recognized Humid Pine-oak Forest, Dry Oak-pine Forest,       Chaparral, Thorn Forest and Scrub, and Thorn Desert.         The only mammal endemic to the Potosian Province in       Tamaulipas is _Cryptotis pergracilis pueblensis_. Other       mammals that occur mainly in this Province are: _Sorex       saussurei_; _Notiosorex crawfordi_; _Glaucomys volans       herreranus_; _Cratogeomys castanops planifrons_;       _Perognathus nelsoni_; _Liomys irroratus alleni_;       _Reithrodontomys fulvescens griseoflavus_; _Microtus       mexicanus subsimus_; _Ursus americanus eremicus_; _Conepatus       leuconotus texensis_; and _Odocoileus hemionus_.         The fauna of this Province is a mixture of elements with       tropical affinities on the east side of the Sierra Madre and       with those of the Mexican Plateau on the west side.      Chihuahuan Biotic Province    This Province occurs in Tamaulipas only in a small portion of the  Central Plateau physiographic region and occupies the southwesternmost  part of the state.         The vegetation is of two types: Desert or       Mesquite-grassland. The last is like that described for the       Tamaulipan Biotic Province. In the Desert type the dominant       plants are the cactus, _Opuntia leptocaulis_, and yuccas,       _Yucca filifera_ and _Y. potosina_. Subdominants are       mariola, guayule, _Agave lechugilla_, _A. stricta_ or       _Larrea divaricata_. Along stream banks mesquite, _Prosopis       juliflora_, can be found.         No endemic mammals of the Chihuahuan Province are known in       Tamaulipas. Mammals that occur principally in this Province       are: _Dipodomys merriami atronasus_; _D. ordii durranti_;       _Peromyscus melanophrys consobrinus_; _P. difficilis       petricola_; _Onychomys torridus subrufus_; and _Neotoma       albigula subsolana_.      Veracruzian Biotic Province    This Province includes the southern part of the Coastal Plain  physiographic region, south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la  Marina. But the exact line between this Province and the Tamaulipan  Province to the north is difficult to draw. The northern boundary of  the Veracruzian Province is the line between the Nearctic and  Neotropical regions in eastern Mexico.    Vegetation of most of the Veracruzian Biotic Province is Tropical  Deciduous Forest. This Forest is made up of _Tabebuia_, _Ipomea_,  _Bombax_, and _Conzattia_, along with some _Ceiba_, _Bursera_, and  _Psidium_.

In House Field the herbaceous vegetation was much more lush than in  Quarry Field and woody plants and weeds were more abundant. A graveled  and heavily used road along one edge of House Field, leading to the  Reservation Headquarters, was a barrier which voles rarely crossed. A  little-used dirt road crossing the trapping plot in Quarry Field  constituted a less effective barrier. The disturbed areas bordering the  roads were likewise little used and tended to reinforce the effects of  the roads as barriers. There were almost pure stands of _Bromus  japonicus_ along both roads. No mammal of any kind was taken in traps  set where this grass was dominant.    Because seasonal changes in vole density followed the curve for rate of  growth of the complex of grasses on the Reservation, and because years  in which there was a sparse growth of plants due to dry weather showed a  decrease in the density of voles, the relationships between productivity  of plants and vole population levels on the two study areas were  investigated. In both fields the composition of the plant cover was  similar, and the differences were chiefly quantitative. In June, 1951,  ten square-meter quadrats were clipped on each of the areas to be  studied. The clippings from each were dried in the sun and weighed. From  Quarry Field the mean yield amounted to 1513 +- 302 lbs. per acre; while  from House Field the yield was 2351 +- 190 lbs. per acre (Table 1). Using  experience gained in making these samples, I periodically estimated the  relative productivity of the two areas. House Field was from 1.5 to 3  times as productive as Quarry Field during the growing seasons of 1951  and 1952. Although House Field, being more productive, usually supported  a larger population of voles than Quarry Field the reverse was true at  the time of the clipping (Fig. 5).      TABLE 1.

In June, 1951, the population of voles and cotton rats on  Quarry Field was increasing rapidly whereas in House Field that trend  was reversed. The trends were reflected by the percentages of immature  individuals in the two populations and by the ratios of the June, 1951,  densities to the March, 1951, densities (Table 1). Perhaps the density  curve was determined in part by factors inherent in the population and,  to that extent, was fluctuating independently of the environment  (Errington, 1946:153).    The flood in 1951 reduced the population of voles and obscured the  normal seasonal trends. Although House Field produced a heavier crop of  vegetation, Quarry Field produced a larger crop of rodents, chiefly  _Microtus_ and _Sigmodon_. In House Field, however, the ratio of  _Sigmodon_ to _Microtus_ was notably higher. Presumably the cotton rats  competed with the voles and exerted a depressing effect on their  numbers. The intensity of the effect seemed to depend on the abundance  of both species. That this depressing effect involved more than direct  competition for plant food was suggested by the fact that in House  Field, with a heavy crop of vegetation and a seemingly high carrying  capacity for both herbivorous rodents, the biomass of voles, and of all  rodents combined, were lower than in Quarry Field which had less  vegetation and fewer cotton rats. The relationships between voles and  cotton rats are discussed further later in this report.    When the centers of activity (Hayne, 1949b) of individual voles were  plotted it was seen that there was a shift in the places of high density  of voles on the trapping areas. This shift seemed to be related to the  advance of the forest edge with such woody plants as _Rhus_ and  _Symphoricarpos_ and young trees invading the area. These shifts were  clearly shown when the distribution of activity centers on both areas in  June, 1951, was compared with the distribution in June, 1952 (Fig. 1).  The shift was gradual and the more or less steady progress could be  observed by comparing the monthly trapping records. It was perhaps  significant that during the summers the centers of activity were less  concentrated than during the winter. The shift of voles away from the  woods was more nearly evident in winter when the voles were driven into  areas of denser ground cover, which provided better shelter.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Progressive encroachment of woody vegetation onto  study areas, and the accompanying shift of the centers of populations of  voles. Activity centers of individuals were calculated as described by  Hayne (1949b) and are indicated by dots. The cross-hatched areas show  places where the vegetation was influenced by the shade of woody  plants.]    From 1948 to 1950 and again in 1952 and 1953 I trapped in various  habitat types in a mixed prairie near Hays, Kansas. Before the great  drought of the thirties, _Microtus ochrogaster_ was the most common  species of small mammal in that area. Since 1948, at least, it has been  taken only rarely and from a few habitats. No voles have been taken from  grazed sites. In a relict area, voles were trapped in a lowland  association dominated by big bluestem. Since 1948 only one vole has been  trapped in the more extensive hillside association characterized by a  mixture of big bluestem, little bluestem and side-oats grama. None was  taken in the upland parts of the relict area where buffalo grass and  blue grama dominated the association.    In the pastured areas there are nine livestock exclosures established by  the Department of Botany of Ft. Hays Kansas State College. These  exclosures included many types of habitat found in the mixed prairie.  All of these exclosures were trapped and voles were taken in only two of  them. An exclosure situated near a pond, on low ground producing a  luxuriant growth of big bluestem and western wheat grass, has supported  voles in 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1953. An upland exclosure containing only  short grasses also supported a few voles in 1953.    An examination of the nature of the various plant associations of the  mixed prairie indicates that yield of grasses, amount of debris and  basal cover may be critical factors in the distribution of voles. The  association to which the voles seemed to belong was the lowland  association. Hopkins _et al_ (1952:401; 409) reported the yield of  grasses from the lowland to be approximately twice as great as from the  hillside and upland in most years. Probably equally important to the  voles was the fact that debris accumulation in the lowland was  approximately five times as great as in the upland and approximately  2.5 times as great as on the hillside (Hopkins, unpublished data). The  unexpected presence of voles in the short grass exclosure was probably  due to two factors. In ungrazed short grass, basal cover may reach 90  per cent (Albertson, 1937:545), thus providing excellent cover for  voles. Also, the ungrazed exclosure had greater yield and a thicker mat  of debris than the grazed short grass surrounding it and was thus a  relatively good habitat, although it did not compare favorably with the  lowland type.    Samples of the populations of various areas, obtained by snap-trapping,  gave further information regarding the types of vegetation preferred by  voles. Voles were taken in all ungrazed and unmown grasslands trapped in  eastern Kansas, although some of the areas were not used at all seasons  of the year nor in years having a low population of _Microtus_. Reithro  Field, similar to Quarry Field in its general aspect, had a heavy  population of voles in the spring and summer of 1951, a time when voles  were generally abundant. On the same area the population of small  mammals was sampled in the summer of 1949 and, though occasional sign of  voles was seen, not one vole was trapped. Later trapping, in the spring  and summer of 1952, also failed to catch any voles and Fitch (1953, _in  litt._) caught none in several trapping attempts in 1953. These later  times were characterized by a general scarcity of voles. Reithro Field  was drier, with less dense vegetation, than the two main study areas and  had larger percentages of little bluestem (_Andropogon scoparius_) and  side-oats grama (_Bouteloua curtipendula_) and smaller percentages of  _Vernonia_, _Verbena_, _Solanum_ and _Solidago_.    Various species of foxtail (_Setaria_) dominated most roadsides in the  vicinity of the Reservation. Voles almost always used these strips of  grass but never were abundant in them. Voles were taken near the margin  of a weedy field, fallow since 1948, but there was none in the middle of  the field. Most individuals were"]]]
