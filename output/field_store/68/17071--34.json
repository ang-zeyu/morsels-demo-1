This probably does injustice to reality (females  were treated the same way), but it should be noted that any error  introduced in this way was almost certain to have increased the number  of \"subadults\" in the samples. Thus, the hypothesis above based on  age-ratios is not automatically invalid because of improper aging.      _Timing of the breeding season_    The time in which egg-clusters are deposited is a good rough index to  events in the breeding cycle. We found four egg-clusters, one on July  14, 1957, and three on July 27, 1957; the only other eggs taken to date  were found in late August (Lowe, 1950:94). Thus, courtship could occur  in June, oviposition in July and August, and hatching from August to  September. Actually, it is likely that the season is more restricted in  time for any one year. Lowe's find was made in a year in which the  summer rains were late, beginning in late July (Stebbins, 1951:137),  whereas ours were made in a year having abundant and relatively early  rainfall, beginning in late June. Microclimatic humidity is of extreme  importance to both the salamanders and their food.    We suppose a great deal of breeding activity takes place underground;  the chronology of events in such sites may bear no close relationship to  those occurring at the surface, yet it is likely that a close parallel  would be found. Breeding activities are ordinarily associated in time  with greatest food abundance.      _Clutch-size_    By clutch-size we refer to the number of eggs in laid clusters. We  collected clutches of six, four, four and one; adding one more of three  (Lowe, _op. cit._) gives an average of 3.6 eggs per cluster; the average  is 4.2 eggs if our clutch of one is discarded on the grounds it was  incomplete.    For comparison we have listed (Table 6) clutch-sizes for some other  plethodontids. It should be noted that these numbers refer only to eggs  deposited in clusters, and not to large ovarian eggs. Thus, _Aneides  hardii_ has the lowest range in clutch-size of any North American  plethodontid on record. It has been noted in other species that low  clutch-size is correlated with low productivity, slow population  turnover, and long average life-expectancy (Lack, 1954:103-105; Pitelka  and Johnston, MS). If this is the case with this salamander, several  other features in its environment and habits would tend to reinforce  such population structure: the animals are exceedingly well-concealed  (they were first described only 17 years ago [Taylor, 1941]), apparently  have few natural enemies (one garter snake [_Thamnophis_] was collected  within the habitat of the salamander in three years), apparently have  few and benign parasites, and abundant and readily available food.

[2] Clusters of one and two occasionally found in _D. ochrophaeus_.    [3] This study, and from Lowe (1950).      _Eggs and \"incubation\"_    Our information concerning eggs essentially duplicates that already  reported (see Stebbins, 1951). All egg clusters that we found were in  small chambers within decomposing fir logs. In each instance the eggs  were suspended from the roofs of the chambers. The clutch of six eggs  was a compact mass, and the individual suspensory cables of the eggs  were intertwined and fused with one another. The clutches of four eggs,  although they too were compact clusters, had each suspensory pedicel  distinct from the others. The surface of the eggs was lightly moist, but  did not glisten with water, and each egg was completely free of the  others. The outer coat of jelly of the fresh eggs measured about 6.4 by  5.7 mm. as they hung suspended; sizes were uniform and no egg was  notably smaller or larger than the others.    We attempted to keep eggs artificially, but mold destroyed them after 12  days. We had difficulty keeping them wet without inundating them, for  the climate at Las Cruces, New Mexico, where we kept the eggs, is  exceedingly dry in summer. Until death, embryos were active and  responsive to disturbances around them. This was at a time when the limb  buds could not be detected and when the external gills were evident only  under close scrutiny.    Two times we found adult female salamanders in the chambers with the egg  clusters. The other two egg clutches seemingly had no attendant adult,  but our method of going through a log was such that we could easily have  alarmed any attendant animal well before we found the eggs, allowing  time for the adult to move away from the eggs. We presume that  incubation, so-called, in _A. hardii_ is similar to that found in other  plethodontids (see, for example, Gordon, 1952:683). Our findings on the  conditions of the stomachs of these attendant adults have been outlined  above (\"Food and Foraging\"). Our limited data suggest that only females  are found in chambers with eggs.      Summary    The montane relict plethodontid _Aneides hardii_ was studied in the  field and laboratory in 1956-1958. Food items detected in a small sample  of stomachs are listed tabularly. Two roundworms were found to  parasitize the guts of the salamanders; the parasitism looks to be  benign. Subterranean winter inactivity is thought to be an integral part  of the salamanders' lives, and is suggested in part by the life cycles  of the worms. Summer activity appears to occur at the ground surface in  logs and talus, and underground; the latter site is suggested by certain  ratios obtained in the samples, showing adults to outnumber young and  males to outnumber females. The season for egg deposition seems to be in  July and August. Clutch-size is lower than for any other plethodontid on  record. \"Incubation\" of eggs apparently parallels that characteristic of  other plethodontids.      Literature Cited    Bishop, S.
