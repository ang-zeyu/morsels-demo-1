This numerous order of animals is divided into three families: 1.  _Apes_, which are destitute of tails; 2. _Baboons_, having short tails;  3. _Monkeys_, having long tails. The whole group are confined to warm  countries, and none but the latter kinds are met with in America. They  are not found in Europe, except at Gibraltar. Here, among the rocks,  are considerable numbers of apes; and it has been conjectured that they  come hither from the African coast, by means of passages under the  Straits. This idea, however, is groundless. No doubt these animals were  once common in Europe; but they have been gradually extirpated, except  at Gibraltar, where they have made a stand. Its rocks and caverns seem  to have proved as impregnable a garrison to them as to the British.      APES.    The ORANG-OUTANG;--a native of Cochin China, Malacca, and the large  adjacent islands. It has a countenance more like that of man than any  other animal. It seldom walks erect, and seems to make its home in the  trees. It is covered with reddish brown hair.    _An Orang-Outang in Holland._--This was a female, brought to that  country in 1776. She generally walked on all fours, like other apes,  but could also walk nearly erect. When, however, she assumed this  posture, her feet were not usually extended like those of a man, but  the toes were curved beneath, in such a manner that she rested chiefly  on the exterior sides of the feet. One morning she escaped from her  chain, and was seen to ascend with wonderful agility the beams and  oblique rafters of the building. With some trouble she was retaken, and  very extraordinary muscular powers were, on this occasion, remarked in  the animal. The efforts of four men were found necessary in order to  secure her. Two of them seized her by the legs, and a third by the  head, whilst the other fastened the collar round her body.    During the time she was at liberty, among other pranks, she had taken a  bottle of Malaga wine which she drank to the last drop, and then set  the bottle again in its place. She ate readily of any kind of food  which was presented to her; but her chief sustenance was bread, roots,  and fruit. She was particularly fond of carrots, strawberries, aromatic  plants, and roots of parsley. She also ate meat, boiled and roasted, as  well as fish, and was fond of eggs, the shells of which she broke with  her teeth, and then emptied by sucking out the contents. If  strawberries were presented to her on a plate, she would pick them up,  one by one, with a fork, and put them into her mouth, holding, at the  same time, the plate in the other hand. Her usual drink was water; but  she also would drink very eagerly all sorts of wine, and of Malaga, in  particular, she was very fond. While she was on shipboard, she ran  freely about the vessel, played with the sailors, and would go, like  them, into the kitchen for her mess. When, at the approach of night,  she was about to lie down, she would prepare the bed on which she slept  by shaking well the hay, and putting it in proper order; and, lastly,  would cover herself up snugly in the quilt.    One day, on noticing the padlock of her chain opened with a key, and  shut again, she seized a little bit of stick, and, putting it into the  keyhole, turned it about in all directions, endeavoring to open it.  When this animal first arrived in Holland, she was only two feet and a  half high, and was almost entirely free from hair on any part of her  body, except her back and arms; but, on the approach of winter, she  became thickly covered all over, and the hair on her back was at least  six inches long, of a chestnut color, except the face and paws, which  were somewhat of a reddish bronze color. This interesting brute died  after having been seven months in Holland.    _An Orang-Outang killed in Sumatra._--This specimen measured eight feet  in height when suspended for the purpose of being skinned. The form and  arrangement of his beard were beautiful; there was a great deal of the  human expression in his countenance, and his piteous actions when  wounded, and great tenacity of life, rendered the scene tragical and  affecting. On the spot where he was killed, there were five or six tall  trees, which greatly prolonged the combat; for so great were his  strength and agility in bounding from branch to branch, that his  pursuers were unable to take a determinate aim, until they had felled  all the trees but one. Even then he did not yield himself to his  antagonists till he had received five balls, and been moreover thrust  through with a spear. One of the first balls appears to have penetrated  his lungs, for he was observed immediately to sling himself by his feet  from a branch, with his head downwards, so as to allow the blood to  flow from his mouth. On receiving a wound, he always put his hand over  the injured part, and distressed his pursuers by the human-like agony  of his expression. When on the ground, after being exhausted by his  many wounds, he lay as if dead, with his head resting on his folded  arms. It was at this moment that an officer attempted to give him the  _coup-de-grace_ by pushing a spear through his body, but he immediately  jumped on his feet, wrested the weapon from his antagonist, and  shivered it in pieces. This was his last wound, and his last great  exertion; yet he lived some time afterwards, and drank, it is stated,  great quantities of water. Captain Cornfoot also observes, that the  animal had probably travelled some distance to the place where he was  killed, as his legs were covered with mud up to the knees.    _An Orang-Outang brought to England._--Dr. Clark Abel has given the  following interesting account of an orang-outang which he brought from  Java to England: \"On board ship an attempt being made to secure him by  a chain tied to a strong staple, he instantly unfastened it, and ran  off with the chain dragging behind; but finding himself embarrassed by  its length, he coiled it once or twice, and threw it over his shoulder.  This feat he often repeated; and when he found that it would not remain  on his shoulder, he took it into his mouth. After several abortive  attempts to secure him more effectually, he was allowed to wander  freely about the ship, and soon became familiar with the sailors, and  surpassed them in agility. They often chased him about the rigging, and  gave him frequent opportunities of displaying his adroitness in  managing an escape. On first starting, he would endeavor to outstrip  his pursuers by mere speed; but when much pressed, eluded them by  seizing a loose rope, and swinging out of their reach. At other times,  he would patiently wait on the shrouds, or at the mast-head, till his  pursuers almost touched him, and then suddenly lower himself to the  deck by any rope that was near him, or bound along the main-stay from  one mast to the other, swinging by his hands, and moving them one over  the other. The men would often shake the ropes by which he clung with  so much violence, as to make me fear his falling; but I soon found that  the power of his muscles could not be easily overcome. When in a  playful humor, he would often swing within arm's length of his pursuer,  and having struck him with his hand, throw himself from him.    \"Whilst in Java, he lodged in a large tamarind-tree near my dwelling,  and formed a bed by intertwining the small branches, and covering them  with leaves. During the day, he would lie with his head projecting  beyond his nest, watching whoever might pass under; and when he saw any  one with fruit, would descend to obtain a share of it. He always  retired for the night at sunset, or sooner if he had been well fed, and  rose with the sun, and visited those from whom he habitually received  food.    \"Of some small monkeys on board from Java, he took little notice whilst  under the observation of the persons of the ship. Once, indeed, he  openly attempted to throw a small cage, containing three of them,  overboard; because, probably, he had seen them receive food, of which  he could obtain no part. But although he held so little intercourse  with them when under our inspection, I had reason to suspect that he  was less indifferent to their society when free from our observation;  and was one day summoned to the top-gallant-yard of the mizzen-mast, to  overlook him playing with a young male monkey. Lying on his back,  partially covered with a sail, he for some time contemplated, with  great gravity, the gambols of the monkey, which bounded over him; but  at length caught him by the tail, and tried to envelop him in his  covering. The monkey seemed to dislike his confinement, and broke from  him, but again renewed its gambols, and although frequently caught,  always escaped. The intercourse, however, did not seem to be that of  equals, for the orang-outang never condescended to romp with the  monkey, as he did with the boys of the ship. Yet the monkeys had  evidently a great predilection for his company; for whenever they broke  loose, they took their way to his resting-place, and were often seen  lurking about it, or creeping clandestinely towards him. There appeared  to be no gradation in their intimacy, as they appeared as confidently  familiar with him when first observed, as at the close of their  acquaintance.    \"This animal neither practises the grimaces and antics of other  monkeys, nor possesses their perpetual proneness to mischief. Gravity,  approaching to melancholy, and mildness, were sometimes strongly  expressed in his countenance, and seemed to be the characteristics of  his disposition. When he first came among strangers, he would sit for  hours with his hand upon his head, looking pensively at all around him;  and when much incommoded by their examination, would hide himself  beneath any covering that was at hand. His mildness was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#3)"],[1," animals were right in the  middle of the frozen lakes (evidently for a noonday rest), and some of  them were lying down. They paid no attention to the plane at a height of  6,000 feet, but were frightened when it came down to 200 feet. This was  the only area where Caribou were sighted during the entire flight.    Duncan A. McLeod, of Winnipeg, informed me that he had seen thousands  and thousands of Caribou on April 16, 1941, while he was flying from  Isle à la Crosse to Beaverlodge on Lake Athabaska. They were nearer to  Lake Athabaska than to the starting-point. They were congregated on  frozen lakes about the middle of the day.    \"Their nomadic migrations during the past 10 years have brought caribou  herds during winter months to northwestern Ontario (Little Sachigo  Lake); central Manitoba (Cormorant, Cross, and Island Lakes); northern  Saskatchewan (Churchill River); northeastern Alberta (Clearwater and  Athabaska Rivers and Lake Claire)\" (Banfield, 1949: 478, fig. 1).      _Spring migration in the Churchill region_    The Hudson Bay Railway is perhaps the only one in North America from  which Barren Ground Caribou of the present subspecies have been seen. On  May 21, 1947, a passenger reported three or four of the animals near  Mile 326, between Gillam and Amery. Farther north, between Herchmer and  Chesnaye, the railway passes for perhaps 30-40 miles through the western  edge of a tundra area, interspersed with small spruce timber; this is  known as the \"Little Barrens.\" It was a thrilling experience to see my  first Caribou here, during a period of three-quarters of an hour on the  afternoon of May 21, from Mile 453 to about Mile 475. There were eight  bands, varying in number from 2 to 60 or 70 and averaging about 20  individuals. The first and largest band was loping away from the train,  at a distance of perhaps 350 yards. A band of 9 or 10, at about 250  yards, exhibited both a trotting and a loping gait. Others, as far off  as half a mile or a mile and therefore less alarmed, seemed to content  themselves with trotting. They maintained a noticeably close formation  while fleeing from the train. Yearlings, appearing only about half the  size of the adults, were readily distinguishable. The animals were in  the midst of their spring migration and were evidently moving in a  general northerly direction over the snow-covered Barrens. The ice of  the small lakes was still solid enough for the Caribou to trot over it.    Two weeks previously a large movement had passed through this area, as I  learned from several sources. A member of the Royal Canadian Mounted  Police detachment at Churchill, for example, had traveled through the  Caribou for a distance of 15 miles without coming to the end of them; he  estimated their numbers at more than 5,000. Joe Chambers, a trapper of  Goose Creek, said the animals had been very plentiful in April, moving  generally northward. He spoke of finding a good many Caribou that Wolves  had killed, contenting themselves with eating only the tongue and the  unborn fawn.    According to a railway conductor, only 12 Caribou were seen from the  train as it passed through the Little Barrens on May 25, and none on May  28.    John Ingebrigtsen, of Churchill, reported passing a frozen lake  somewhere east of the Duck Lake Post, that was \"absolutely full\" of  Caribou. It was about a mile and a half long by half a mile wide, and he  estimated the number of animals at not less than 20,000. This was in the  early part of May, 1942 or 1943, when the spring migration was no doubt  under way.    During a plane flight from Eskimo Point to Baker Lake on May 22, 1947,  John M. Bourassa and Don Gallagher sighted numbers of Caribou, including  one herd of about 500. On May 28 the former saw a Caribou between  Churchill and Fort Churchill. From other sources I learned that small  numbers occasionally pass along the outskirts of Churchill during the  migrations.    Professor Hazel R. Ellis (_in litt._, April 13, 1953) reports seeing  several bands of Caribou from the train as it approached Churchill on  June 8, 1947; also a band between Churchill and Fort Churchill on June  13 and 21, 1949, and a single animal on June 28, 1949, on the west side  of the river near Churchill. On July 5, 1949, she filmed a herd of over  40 Caribou at Bird Cove on Cape Churchill.    Preble writes (1902: 41): \"Between York Factory and Fort Churchill a few  small bands [of Woodland Caribou] are found throughout the year on the  'Barrens'.\" He includes reports to this effect from several sources,  including J. W. Tyrrell (1898). The latter, however, does not specify  which species of Caribou his party encountered. It might be expected  that _R. a. arcticus_, rather than _R. caribou sylvestris_, would be the  proper inhabitant of this tundra area. It is beyond question that the  animals seen in recent years on the \"Little Barrens\" between the  Churchill and the Nelson Rivers are the Barren Ground species.  Furthermore, Mr. G. W. Malaher, of the Manitoba Game and Fisheries  Branch, informed me that a considerable number of this species spend the  summer and have their fawns on the Barrens in this area.      _Spring migration in the Nueltin Lake region_    The general pattern of this migration, as manifested particularly about  the northwestern portion of the lake, was explained by Charles Schweder.  As a rule, practically all the local Caribou spend the winter in the  wooded country to the southward. When the northward movement starts in  the spring, the does precede the bucks; they migrate through this area  mostly in May (and apparently more commonly in the latter half of the  month), but to some extent in April or even earlier. During June the  majority of the animals passing by are bucks. According to Fred  Schweder, Jr., the spring migration here is more regular, less erratic,  than the fall migration.    When I arrived at Nueltin Lake on May 31, the spring migration was in  full swing; it continued through June in gradually lessening force, and  the last northbound band was seen on July 1. In the meantime many  interesting details of caribou behavior came to light.    While flying from Churchill to Duck Lake Post on May 31, at a height of  about 500 feet, we detected three bands on the frozen surface of Seal  River, where they were evidently taking a noonday rest. They numbered  approximately 40, 20, and 6 individuals. Within 20 minutes after  resuming our journey, from Duck Lake Post to Nueltin Lake, we saw four  more bands, numbering from two to a dozen individuals. Finally, just  before landing on Windy Bay, we noticed a band of perhaps 20 crossing  the bay a mile from its head.    Observations during the following 10 days showed that this was a very  definite crossing-place for the Caribou, as if some invisible barrier on  each side kept them to a certain line of march. Moreover, Charles  Schweder informed me that they followed this identical route year after  year. An examination of the local topography (map 1) soon revealed the  reason. The rugged south side of Windy Bay rises steeply for some 500  feet to the summit of the Windy Hills, and over a considerable distance  there are precipices and talus slopes barring the passage of such  animals as Caribou. But the mile-long South Bay, meeting Windy Bay at  right angles, affords a convenient break in the hills; and the slopes  thereabouts are gradual enough to be negotiated readily by the Caribou.  So here they converge from the neighboring heights, making long,  slanting trails through the snow that are visible for miles; they pass  out of the narrow mouth of South Bay as through a funnel, then follow  the beaten path of their predecessors across the ice of Windy Bay toward  the farther shore, until they are lost to view among a cluster of  islands. It may be further remarked that their course northeastward from  the mouth of South Bay is less obstructed by islands than almost any  near-by portion of Windy Bay.    From our camp, a mile or so distant, Caribou in bands of approximately  the following numbers were observed using this crossing-place during the  early part of June: June 1--7, 10, 18, 20, and several other bands of  unrecorded size; June 2--10, 3, 7; June 3--4, 4, 10, 30, 70, and others;  June 4--3, 40?; June 5--40, 50, 75; June 6--25; June 10--8. Of course  many others must have passed while our attention was elsewhere engaged.  In most cases my records indicate the time of day when the bands were  crossing Windy Bay. The periods were mainly from 10 to 11 a.m., from  2:30 to 5 p.m., and in the evening. Perhaps the infrequency of midday  passages was due to the habit of the Caribou of resting at this period.  One of the last bands to pass during the evening of June 1 consisted of  about 20 individuals. Two big bucks were in the lead, and apparently a  few others were scattered along the line. At the very rear was a big,  extra-dark buck, immediately preceded by a yearling barely half its  size.    In crossing the bay ice, the animals traveled habitually in long files,  one after the other, and yet not altogether in single file. In watching  the endlessly interesting spectacle from camp, we could not always count  the individuals exactly, for here and there a few would get abreast of  others and be partly concealed. The general formation of each band was  that of a much strung-out procession. For the most part the animals  progressed at a moderate walking gait; there were no flies to spur them  on at this season. On one occasion the forward element of a large band  was actually running, but those in the rear were going calmly, and there  was no visible cause of alarm. At mid-morning of June 6 most of a band  of 25 were lying down to rest on the bay ice, while a few remained  standing.    Meanwhile Caribou in some numbers were advancing northward by crossing  Windy River, the ice on which did not break up generally till June 14.  On June 3,"]]]
