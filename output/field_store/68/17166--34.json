Frequent explosions of gunpowder, lighting  fires between decks, and a liberal use of that admirable antiseptic,  oil of tar, were the preventives we made use of against impure air; and  above all things we were careful to keep the men's bedding and wearing  apparel dry. As we advanced towards the Line, the weather grew gradually  better and more pleasant. On the 14th of July we passed the Equator, at  which time the atmosphere was as serene, and the temperature of the air  not hotter than in a bright summer day in England. From this period,  until our arrival on the American coast, the heats, the calms, and  the rains by which we had been so much incommoded, were succeeded by a  series of weather as delightful as it was unlooked for. At three o'clock  in the afternoon of the 2nd of August, the 'Supply', which had been  previously sent a-head on purpose, made the signal for seeing the land,  which was visible to the whole fleet before sunset, and proved to be  Cape Frio, in latitude 23 deg 5 min south, longitude 41 deg 40 1/4 min  west.    Owing to light airs we did not get a-breast of the city of St.  Sebastian, in the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, until the 7th of the month,  when we anchored about three quarters of a mile from the shore.          CHAPTER V.        From the Arrival of the Fleet at Rio de Janeiro, till its Departure for  the Cape of Good Hope; with some Remarks on the Brazils.      Brazil is a country very imperfectly known in Europe. The Portugueze,  from political motives, have been sparing in their accounts of it.  Whence our descriptions of it, in the geographical publications in  England, are drawn, I know not: that they are miserably erroneous and  defective, is certain.    The city of St. Sebastian stands on the west side of the harbour, in a  low unhealthy situation, surrounded on all sides by hills, which  stop the free circulation of air, and subject its inhabitants to  intermittents and putrid diseases. It is of considerable extent: Mr.  Cook makes it as large as Liverpool; but Liverpool, in 1767, when Mr.  Cook wrote, was not two-thirds of its present size. Perhaps it  equals Chester, or Exeter, in the share of ground it occupies, and is  infinitely more populous than either of them. The streets intersect each  other at right angles, are tolerably well built, and excellently paved,  abounding with shops of every kind, in which the wants of a stranger,  if money is not one of them, can hardly remain unsatisfied. About the  centre of the city, and at a little distance from the beach, the Palace  of the Viceroy stands, a long, low building, no wise remarkable in  its exterior appearance; though within are some spacious and handsome  apartments. The churches and convents are numerous, and richly  decorated; hardly a night passes without some of the latter being  illuminated in honour of their patron saints, which has a very brilliant  effect when viewed from the water, and was at first mistaken by us for  public rejoicings. At the corner of almost every street stands a little  image of the Virgin, stuck round with lights in an evening, before which  passengers frequently stop to pray and sing very loudly. Indeed, the  height to which religious zeal is carried in this place, cannot fail  of creating astonishment in a stranger. The greatest part of the  inhabitants seem to have no other occupation, than that of paying visits  and going to church, at which times you see them sally forth richly  dressed, en chapeau bras, with the appendages of a bag for the hair,  and a small sword: even boys of six years old are seen parading about,  furnished with these indispensable requisites. Except when at their  devotions, it is not easy to get a sight of the women, and when  obtained, the comparisons drawn by a traveller, lately arrived from  England, are little flattering to Portugueze beauty. In justice,  however, to the ladies of St. Sebastian, I must observe, that the custom  of throwing nosegays at strangers, for the purpose of bringing on an  assignation, which Doctor Solander, and another gentleman of Mr. Cook's  ship, met with when here, was never seen by any of us in a single  instance. We were so deplorably unfortunate as to walk every evening  before their windows and balconies, without being honoured with a single  bouquet, though nymphs and flowers were in equal and great abundance.    Among other public buildings, I had almost forgot to mention an  observatory, which stands near the middle of the town, and is tolerably  well furnished with astronomical instruments. During our stay here, some  Spanish and Portuguese mathematicians were endeavouring to determine  the boundaries of the territories belonging to their respective crowns.  Unhappily, however, for the cause of science, these gentleman have not  hitherto been able to coincide in their accounts, so that very little  information on this head, to be depended upon, could be gained. How far  political motives may have caused this disagreement, I do not presume to  decide; though it deserves notice, that the Portuguese accuse the Abbee  de la Caille, who observed here by order of the King of France, of  having laid down the longitude of this place forty-five miles too much  to the eastward.    Until the year 1770, all the flour in the settlement was brought  from Europe; but since that time the inhabitants have made so rapid a  progress in raising grain, as to be able to supply themselves with it  abundantly. The principal corn country lies around Rio Grande, in the  latitude of 32 deg south, where wheat flourishes so luxuriantly, as to  yield from seventy to eighty bushels for one. Coffee also, which they  formerly received from Portugal, now grows in such plenty as to enable  them to export considerable quantities of it. But the staple commodity  of the country is sugar. That they have not, however, learnt the art  of making palatable rum, the English troops in New South Wales can bear  testimony; a large quantity, very ill flavoured, having been bought and  shipped here for the use of the garrison of Port Jackson.    It was in 1771 that St. Salvador, which had for more than a century been  the capital of Brazil, ceased to be so; and that the seat of Government  was removed to St. Sebastian. The change took place on account of  the colonial war, at that time carried on by the Courts of Lisbon and  Madrid. And, indeed, were the object of security alone to determine  the seat of Government, I know but few places better situated in that  respect than the one I am describing; the natural strength of the  country, joined to the difficulties which would attend an attack on the  fortifications, being such as to render it very formidable.    It may be presumed that the Portuguese Government is well apprized of  this circumstance and of the little risque they run in being deprived  of so important a possession, else it will not be easy to penetrate the  reasons which induce them to treat the troops who compose the garrison  with such cruel negligence. Their regiments were ordered out with a  promise of being relieved, and sent back to Europe at the end of  three years, in conformity to which they settled all their domestic  arrangements. But the faith of Government has been broken, and at the  expiration of twenty years, all that is left to the remnant of these  unfortunate men, is to suffer in submissive silence. I was one evening  walking with a Portuguese officer, when this subject was started, and  on my telling him, that such a breach of public honour to English troops  would become a subject of parliamentary enquiry, he seized my hand  with great eagerness, \"Ah, Sir!\" exclaimed he, \"yours is a free  country--we\"!----His emotions spoke what his tongue refused.    As I am mentioning the army, I cannot help observing, that I saw nothing  here to confirm the remark of Mr. Cook, that the inhabitants of the  place, whenever they meet an officer of the garrison, bow to him with  the greatest obsequiousness; and by omitting such a ceremony, would  subject themselves to be knocked down, though the other seldom deigns to  return the compliment. The interchange of civilities is general between  them, and seems by no means extorted. The people who could submit to  such insolent superiority, would, indeed, deserve to be treated as  slaves.    The police of the city is very good. Soldiers patrole the streets  frequently, and riots are seldom heard of. The dreadful custom of  stabbing, from motives of private resentment, is nearly at an end,  since the church has ceased to afford an asylum to murderers. In other  respects, the progress of improvement appears slow, and fettered by  obstacles almost insurmountable, whose baneful influence will continue,  until a more enlightened system of policy shall be adopted. From morning  to night the ears of a stranger are greeted by the tinkling of the  convent bells, and his eyes saluted by processions of devotees, whose  adoration and levity seem to keep equal pace, and succeed each other in  turns. \"Do you want to make your son sick of soldiering? Shew him the  Trainbands of London on a field-day.\" Let him who would wish to give his  son a distaste to Popery, point out to him the sloth, the ignorance, and  the bigotry of this place.    Being nearly ready to depart by the 1st of September, as many officers  as possible went on that day to the palace to take leave of his  Excellency, the Viceroy of the Brazils, to whom we had been previously  introduced; who on this, and every other occasion, was pleased to honour  us with the most distinguished marks of regard and attention. Some part,  indeed, of the numerous indulgencies we experienced during our stay  here, must doubtless be attributed to the high respect in which the  Portuguese held Governor Phillip, who was for many years a captain in  their navy, and commanded a ship of war on this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#3)"],[1,"forward silent and staring. A short  avenue of cypresses led, widening as it went, to a marble terrace  that lay broad and white in the sunlight. The children, blinking,  leaned their arms on the broad, flat balustrade and gazed.  Immediately below them was a lake just like a lake in \"The  Beauties of Italy\" a lake with swans and an island and weeping  willows; beyond it were green slopes dotted with groves of trees,  and amid the trees gleamed the white limbs of statues. Against a  little hill to the left was a round white building with pillars, and to  the right a waterfall came tumbling down among mossy stones to  splash into the lake. Steps fed from the terrace to the water, and  other steps to the green lawns beside it. Away across the grassy  slopes deer were feeding, and in the distance where the groves of  trees thickened into what looked almost a forest were enormous  shapes of grey stone, like nothing that the children had ever seen  before.    \"That chap at school ,\" said Gerald.    \"It is an enchanted castle,\" said Kathleen.    \"I don't see any castle,\" said Jimmy.    \"What do you call that, then?\" Gerald pointed to where, beyond a  belt of lime-trees, white towers and turrets broke the blue of the  sky.    \"There doesn't seem to be anyone about,\" said Kathleen, \"and yet  it's all so tidy. I believe it is magic\"    \"Magic mowing machines,\" Jimmy suggested.    \"If we were in a book it would be an enchanted castle certain to  be,\" said Kathleen.    \"It is an enchanted castle,\" said Gerald in hollow tones.    \"But there aren't any\" Jimmy was quite positive.    \"How do you know? Do you think there's nothing in the world but  what you've seen?\" His scorn was crushing.    \"I think magic went out when people began to have  steam-engines,\" Jimmy insisted, \"and newspapers, and telephones  and wireless telegraphing.\"    \"Wireless is rather like magic when you come to think of it,\" said  Gerald.    \"Oh, that sort!\" Jimmy's contempt was deep.    \"Perhaps there's given up being magic because people didn't  believe in it any more,\" said Kathleen.    \"Well, don't let's spoil the show with any silly old not believing,\"  said Gerald with decision. \"I'm going to believe in magic as hard  as I can. This is an enchanted garden, and that's an enchanted  castle, and I'm jolly well going to explore.\"    The dauntless knight then led the way, leaving his ignorant squires  to follow or not, just as they jolly well chose. He rolled off the  balustrade and strode firmly down towards the lawn, his boots  making, as they went, a clatter full of determination. The others  followed. There never was such a garden out of a picture or a  fairy-tale. They passed quite close by the deer, who only raised  their pretty heads to look, and did not seem startled at all. And  after a long stretch of turf they passed under the heaped-up heavy  masses of lime-trees and came into a rose-garden, bordered with  thick, close-cut yew hedges, and lying red and pink and green and  white in the sun, like a giant's many-coloured, highly-scented  pocket-handkerchief.    \"I know we shall meet a gardener in a minute, and he'll ask what  we re doing here. And then what will you say?\" Kathleen asked  with her nose in a rose.    \"I shall say we have lost our way, and it will be quite true,\" said  Gerald.    But they did not meet a gardener or anybody else, and the feeling  of magic got thicker and thicker, till they were almost afraid of the  sound of their feet in the great silent place. Beyond the rose garden  was a yew hedge with an arch cut in it, and it was the beginning of  a maze like the one in Hampton Court.    \"Now,\" said Gerald, \"you mark my words. In the middle of this  maze we shall find the secret enchantment. Draw your swords, my  merry men all, and hark forward tallyho in the utmost silence.  Which they did. It was very hot in the maze, between the close yew  hedges, and the way to the maze's heart was hidden well. Again  and again they found themselves at the black yew arch that opened  on the rose garden, and they were all glad that they had brought  large, clean pocket-handkerchiefs with them. It was when they  found themselves there for the fourth time that Jimmy suddenly  cried, \"Oh, I wish ' and then stopped short very suddenly. \"Oh!\" he  added in quite a different voice, \"where's the dinner?\" And then in  a stricken silence they all remembered that the basket with the  dinner had been left at the entrance of the cave. Their thoughts  dwelt fondly on the slices of cold mutton, the six tomatoes, the  bread and butter, the screwed-up paper of salt, the apple turnovers,  and the little thick glass that one drank the ginger-beer out of.    \"Let's go back,\" said Jimmy, \"now this minute, and get our things  and have our dinner.\"    \"Let's have one more try at the maze. I hate giving things up,\" said  Gerald.    \"I am so hungry!\" said Jimmy.    \"Why didn't you say so before?\" asked Gerald bitterly.    \"I wasn't before.\"    \"Then you can't be now. You don't get hungry all in a minute.  What's that?\"    That was a gleam of red that lay at the foot of the yew-hedge a thin  little line, that you would hardly have noticed unless you had been  staring in a fixed and angry way at the roots of the hedge.    It was a thread of cotton. Gerald picked it up. One end of it was  tied to a thimble with holes in it, and the other--    \"There is no other end,\" said Gerald, with firm triumph. \"It's a clew  that's what it is. What price cold mutton now? I've always felt  something magic would happen some day, and now it has.\"    \"I expect the gardener put it there,\" said Jimmy.    \"With a Princess's silver thimble on it? Look! there's a crown on  the thimble.\"    There was.    \"Come,\" said Gerald in low, urgent tones, \"if you are adventurers  be adventurers; and anyhow, I expect someone has gone along the  road and bagged the mutton hours ago.\"    He walked forward, winding the red thread round his fingers as he  went. And it was a clew, and it led them right into the middle of  the maze. And in the very middle of the maze they came upon the  wonder.    The red clew led them up two stone steps to a round grass plot.  There was a sun-dial in the middle, and all round against the yew  hedge a low, wide marble seat. The red clew ran straight across the  grass and by the sun-dial, and ended in a small brown hand with  jewelled rings on every finger. The hand was, naturally, attached  to an arm, and that had many bracelets on it, sparkling with red  and blue and green stones. The arm wore a sleeve of pink and gold  brocaded silk, faded a little here and there but still extremely  imposing, and the sleeve was part of a dress, which was worn by a  lady who lay on the stone seat asleep in the sun. The rosy gold  dress fell open over an embroidered petticoat of a soft green  colour. There was old yellow lace the colour of scalded cream, and  a thin white veil spangled with silver stars covered the face.    \"It's the enchanted Princess,\" said Gerald, now really impressed. \"I  told you so.\"    \"It's the Sleeping Beauty,\" said Kathleen. \"It is look how  old-fashioned her clothes are, like the pictures of Marie  Antoinette's ladies in the history book. She has slept for a hundred  years. Oh, Gerald, you're the eldest; you must be the Prince, and  we never knew it.\"    \"She isn't really a Princess,\" said Jimmy. But the others laughed at  him, partly because his saying things like that was enough to spoil  any game, and partly because they really were not at all sure that it  was not a Princess who lay there as still as the sunshine. Every  stage of the adventure the cave, the wonderful gardens, the maze,  the clew, had deepened the feeling of magic, till now Kathleen and  Gerald were almost completely bewitched.    \"Lift the veil up,\" Jerry, said Kathleen in a whisper, \"if she isn't  beautiful we shall know she can't be the Princess.    \"Lift it yourself,\" said Gerald.    \"I expect you're forbidden to touch the figures,\" said Jimmy.    \"It's not wax, silly,\" said his brother.    \"No,\" said his sister, \"wax wouldn't be much good in this sun. And,  besides, you can see her breathing. It's the Princess right enough.\"  She very gently lifted the edge of the veil and turned it back. The  Princess's face was small and white between long plaits of black  hair. Her nose was straight and her brows finely traced. There were  a few freckles on cheekbones and nose.    \"No wonder,\" whispered Kathleen, \"sleeping all these years in all  this sun! Her mouth was not a rosebud. But all the same \"Isn't she  lovely!\" Kathleen murmured. \"Not so dusty,\" Gerald was  understood to reply. \"Now, Jerry,\" said Kathleen firmly, \"you're the  eldest.\"    \"Of course I am,\" said Gerald uneasily.    \"Well, you've got to wake the Princess.\"    \"She's not a Princess,\" said Jimmy, with his hands in the pockets of  his knickerbockers; \"she's only a little girl dressed up.\"    \"But she's in long dresses,\" urged Kathleen.    \"Yes, but look what a little way down her frock her feet come. She  wouldn't be any taller than Jerry if she was to stand up.\"    \"Now then,\" urged Kathleen. \"Jerry, don't be silly. You've got to do  it.\"    \"Do what?\" asked Gerald, kicking his left boot with his right.    \"Why, kiss her awake, of course.\"    \"Not me!\" was Gerald's unhesitating rejoinder.    \"Well, someone's got to.\"    \"She'd go for me as likely as not the minute she woke up,\" said  Gerald anxiously.    \"I'd do it like a shot,\" said Kathleen, \"but I don't suppose it ud  make any difference me kissing her.\"    She did it; and it didn't. The Princess still lay in deep slumber.    \"Then you must, Jimmy. I dare say you'll do. Jump back quickly  before she can hit you.\"    \"She won't hit him, he's such a little chap,\" said Gerald.    \"Little yourself!\" said Jimmy. \"I don't mind kissing her. I'm not a  coward, like Some People. Only if I do, I'm going to be the  dauntless leader for the rest of the day.\"    \"No, look here hold "]]]
