But at the commencement of the seventeenth century, their  abbey lands infinitely advanced in value, and their rental swollen by  the prudent accumulation of more than seventy years, a Greymount, who  was then a county member, was elevated to the peerage as Baron Marney.  The heralds furnished his pedigree, and assured the world that although  the exalted rank and extensive possessions enjoyed at present by  the Greymounts, had their origin immediately in great territorial  revolutions of a recent reign, it was not for a moment to be supposed,  that the remote ancestors of the Ecclesiastical Commissioner of 1530  were by any means obscure. On the contrary, it appeared that they were  both Norman and baronial, their real name Egremont, which, in their  patent of peerage the family now resumed.    In the civil wars, the Egremonts pricked by their Norman blood, were  cavaliers and fought pretty well. But in 1688, alarmed at the prevalent  impression that King James intended to insist on the restitution of the  church estates to their original purposes, to wit, the education of the  people and the maintenance of the poor, the Lord of Marney Abbey became  a warm adherent of \"civil and religious liberty,\"--the cause for which  Hampden had died in the field, and Russell on the scaffold,--and joined  the other whig lords, and great lay impropriators, in calling over the  Prince of Orange and a Dutch army, to vindicate those popular principles  which, somehow or other, the people would never support. Profiting by  this last pregnant circumstance, the lay Abbot of Marney also in this  instance like the other whig lords, was careful to maintain, while he  vindicated the cause of civil and religious liberty, a very loyal and  dutiful though secret correspondence with the court of St Germains.    The great deliverer King William the Third, to whom Lord Marney was  a systematic traitor, made the descendant of the Ecclesiastical  Commissioner of Henry the Eighth an English earl; and from that time  until the period of our history, though the Marney family had never  produced one individual eminent for civil or military abilities, though  the country was not indebted to them for a single statesman, orator,  successful warrior, great lawyer, learned divine, eminent author,  illustrious man of science, they had contrived, if not to engross any  great share of public admiration and love, at least to monopolise no  contemptible portion of public money and public dignities. During the  seventy years of almost unbroken whig rule, from the accession of the  House of Hanover to the fall of Mr Fox, Marney Abbey had furnished  a never-failing crop of lord privy seals, lord presidents, and  lord lieutenants. The family had had their due quota of garters and  governments and bishoprics; admirals without fleets, and generals who  fought only in America. They had glittered in great embassies with  clever secretaries at their elbow, and had once governed Ireland when  to govern Ireland was only to apportion the public plunder to a corrupt  senate.    Notwithstanding however this prolonged enjoyment of undeserved  prosperity, the lay abbots of Marney were not content. Not that it was  satiety that induced dissatisfaction. The Egremonts could feed on.  They wanted something more. Not to be prime ministers or secretaries of  state, for they were a shrewd race who knew the length of their tether,  and notwithstanding the encouraging example of his grace of Newcastle,  they could not resist the persuasion that some knowledge of the  interests and resources of nations, some power of expressing opinions  with propriety, some degree of respect for the public and for himself,  were not altogether indispensable qualifications, even under a Venetian  constitution, in an individual who aspired to a post so eminent and  responsible. Satisfied with the stars and mitres and official seals,  which were periodically apportioned to them, the Marney family did not  aspire to the somewhat graceless office of being their distributor. What  they aimed at was promotion in their order; and promotion to the highest  class. They observed that more than one of the other great \"civil and  religious liberty\" families,--the families who in one century plundered  the church to gain the property of the people, and in another century  changed the dynasty to gain the power of the crown,--had their brows  circled with the strawberry leaf. And why should not this distinction be  the high lot also of the descendants of the old gentleman usher of one  of King Henry's plundering vicar-generals? Why not? True it is, that  a grateful sovereign in our days has deemed such distinction the only  reward for half a hundred victories. True it is, that Nelson, after  conquering the Mediterranean, died only a Viscount! But the house of  Marney had risen to high rank; counted themselves ancient nobility; and  turned up their noses at the Pratts and the Smiths, the Jenkinsons and  the Robinsons of our degenerate days; and never had done anything  for the nation or for their honours. And why should they now? It was  unreasonable to expect it. Civil and religious liberty, that had  given them a broad estate and a glittering coronet, to say nothing  of half-a-dozen close seats in parliament, ought clearly to make them  dukes.    But the other great whig families who had obtained this honour, and who  had done something more for it than spoliate their church and betray  their king, set up their backs against this claim of the Egremonts.  The Egremonts had done none of the work of the last hundred years  of political mystification, during which a people without power or  education, had been induced to believe themselves the freest and most  enlightened nation in the world, and had submitted to lavish their blood  and treasure, to see their industry crippled and their labour mortgaged,  in order to maintain an oligarchy, that had neither ancient memories to  soften nor present services to justify their unprecedented usurpation.    How had the Egremonts contributed to this prodigious result? Their  family had furnished none of those artful orators whose bewildering  phrase had fascinated the public intelligence; none of those toilsome  patricians whose assiduity in affairs had convinced their unprivileged  fellow-subjects that government was a science, and administration an  art, which demanded the devotion of a peculiar class in the state for  their fulfilment and pursuit. The Egremonts had never said anything that  was remembered, or done anything that could be recalled. It was decided  by the Great Revolution families, that they should not be dukes.  Infinite was the indignation of the lay Abbot of Marney. He counted his  boroughs, consulted his cousins, and muttered revenge. The opportunity  soon offered for the gratification of his passion.    The situation of the Venetian party in the wane of the eighteenth  century had become extremely critical. A young king was making often  fruitless, but always energetic, struggles to emancipate his national  royalty from the trammels of the factious dogeship. More than sixty  years of a government of singular corruption had alienated all hearts  from the oligarchy; never indeed much affected by the great body of the  people. It could no longer be concealed, that by virtue of a plausible  phrase power had been transferred from the crown to a parliament, the  members of which were appointed by an extremely limited and exclusive  class, who owned no responsibility to the country, who debated and  voted in secret, and who were regularly paid by the small knot of great  families that by this machinery had secured the permanent possession  of the king's treasury. Whiggism was putrescent in the nostrils of  the nation; we were probably on the eve of a bloodless yet important  revolution; when Rockingham, a virtuous magnifico, alarmed and  disgusted, resolved to revive something of the pristine purity and  high-toned energy of the old whig connection; appealed to his \"new  generation\" from a degenerate age, arrayed under his banner the generous  youth of the whig families, and was fortunate to enlist in the service  the supreme genius of Edmund Burke.    Burke effected for the whigs what Bolingbroke in a preceding age had  done for the tories: he restored the moral existence of the party. He  taught them to recur to the ancient principles of their connection,  and suffused those principles with all the delusive splendour of his  imagination. He raised the tone of their public discourse; he breathed  a high spirit into their public acts. It was in his power to do more for  the whigs than St John could do for his party. The oligarchy, who had  found it convenient to attaint Bolingbroke for being the avowed  minister of the English Prince with whom they were always in secret  communication, when opinion forced them to consent to his  restitution, had tacked to the amnesty a clause as cowardly as it was  unconstitutional, and declared his incompetence to sit in the parliament  of his country. Burke on the contrary fought the whig fight with  a two-edged weapon: he was a great writer; as an orator he was  transcendent. In a dearth of that public talent for the possession of  which the whigs have generally been distinguished, Burke came forward  and established them alike in the parliament and the country. And what  was his reward? No sooner had a young and dissolute noble, who with  some of the aspirations of a Caesar oftener realised the conduct of  a Catiline, appeared on the stage, and after some inglorious  tergiversation adopted their colours, than they transferred to him  the command which had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#3)"],[1,"was seen of them, after that time however they took courage again  and returned.  As they approached they made signs to show that they  came in peace, and with them they brought huge bales of furs which  they wished to barter.    The Norsemen, it is true, could not understand the language of  the natives, nor could the natives understand the Norsemen; but by  signs they made known that they wished to barter their furs for  weapons.  This, however, Thorfinn forbade.  Instead he gave them  strips of red cloth which they took very eagerly and bound about  their heads.  Thorfinn also commanded his men to take milk to the  savages.  And when they saw it they were eager to buy and drink it.  So that it was said many of them carried away their merchandise in  their stomachs.    Thus the days and months passed.  Then one summer day a little son  was born to Thorfinn and Gudrid.  They called him Snorri, and he  was the first white child to be born on the Continent which later  men called the New World.  Thus three years went past.  But the days  were not all peaceful.  For quarrels arose between the newcomers  and the natives, and the savages attacked the Norsemen and killed  many of them.    Then Thorfinn said he would no longer stay in Vineland, but would  return to Greenland.  So he and all his company made ready their  ship, and sailed out upon the seas, and came at length safely to  Greenland.    Then after a time Thorfinn sailed to Iceland.  There he made his home  for the rest of his life, the people holding him in high honour.  Snorri also, his son who had been born in Vineland, grew to be a  man of great renown.    Such are some of the old Norse stories of the first finding of  America.  The country which Leif called Helluland was most likely  Labrador, Markland Newfoundland, and Vineland Nova Scotia.    Besides these there were many other tales of voyages to Vineland.  For after Leif and his brothers many other Vikings of the North  sailed, both from Greenland and from Norway, to the fair western  lands.  Yet although they sailed there so often these old Norsemen  had no idea that they had discovered a vast continent.  They thought  that Vineland was merely an island, and the discovery of it made  no stir in Europe.  By degrees too the voyages thither ceased.  In  days of wild warfare at home the Norsemen forgot the fair western  land which Leif had discovered.  They heard of it only in minstrel  tales, and it came to be for them a sort of fairy-land which had  no existence save in a poet's dream.    But now wise men have read these tales with care, and many have  come to believe that they are not mere fairy stories.  They have  come to believe that hundreds of years before Columbus lived the  Vikings of the North sailed the western seas and found the land  which lay beyond, the land which we now call America.    __________            Chapter 2 - The Sea of Darkness and the Great Faith of Columbus          In those far-off times besides the Vikings of the North other  daring sailors sailed the seas.  But all their sailings took them  eastward.  For it was from the east that all the trade and the riches  came in those days.  To India and to far Cathay sailed the merchant  through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, to return with a rich  and fragrant cargo of silks and spices, pearls and priceless gems.    None thought of sailing westward.  For to men of those days the  Atlantic Ocean was known as the Outer Sea or the Sea of Darkness.  There was nothing to be gained by venturing upon it, much to be  dreaded.  It was said that huge and horrible sea-dragons lived there,  ready to wreck and swallow down any vessel that might venture near.  An enormous bird also hovered in the skies waiting to pounce upon  vessels and bear them away to some unknown eyrie.  Even if any  foolhardy adventurers should defy these dangers, and escape the  horror of the dragons and the bird, other perils threatened them.  For far in the west there lay a bottomless pit of seething fire.  That was easy of proof.  Did not the face of the setting sun glow  with the reflected light as it sank in the west? There would be no  hope nor rescue for any ship that should be drawn into that awful  pit.    Again it was believed that the ocean flowed downhill, and that if a  ship sailed down too far it would never be able to get back again.  These and many other dangers, said the ignorant people of those  days, threatened the rash sailors who should attempt to sail upon  the Sea of Darkness.  So it was not wonderful that for hundreds of  years men contented themselves with the well-known routes which  indeed offered adventure enough to satisfy the heart of the most  daring.    But as time passed these old trade-routes fell more and more into  the hands of Turks and Infidels.  Port after port came under their  rule, and infidel pirates swarmed in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean  until no Christian vessel was safe.  At every step Christian traders  found themselves hampered and hindered, and in danger of their  lives, and they began to long for another way to the lands of spice  and pearls.    Then it was that men turned their thoughts to the dread Sea of  Darkness.  The less ignorant among them had begun to disbelieve the  tales of dragons and fiery pits.  The world was round, said wise  men.  Why then, if that were so, India could be reached by sailing  west as well as by sailing east.    Many men now came to this conclusion, among them an Italian sailor  named Christopher Columbus.  The more Columbus thought about his  plan of sailing west to reach India, the more he believed in it,  and the more he longed to set out.  But without a great deal of money  such an expedition was impossible, and Columbus was poor.  His only  hope was to win the help and friendship of a king or some other  great and wealthy person.    The Portuguese were in those days a sea-faring people, and their  ships were to be found wherever ships dared go.  Indeed Prince Henry  of Portugal did so much to encourage voyages of discovery that he  was called Henry the Navigator.  And although he was by this time  dead, the people still took great interest in voyages of discovery.  So at length Columbus determined to go to King John of Portugal to  tell him of his plans, and ask for his aid.    King John listened kindly enough, it seemed, to what Columbus had  to say.  But before giving him any answer he said that he must  consult his wise men.  These wise men looked upon the whole idea  of sailing to the west to reach the east as absurd.  So King John  refused to give Columbus any help.    Yet although most of King John's wise men thought little of the  plan, King John himself thought that there was something in it.  But instead of helping Columbus he meanly resolved to send out  an expedition of his own.  This he did, and when Columbus heard of  it he was so angry that he left Portugal, which for more than ten  years he had made his home.  He was poor and in debt, so he left  the country secretly, in fear of the King, and of those to whom he  owed money.    When Columbus thus fled from Portugal, penniless and in debt, he  was a man over forty.  He was a bitterly disappointed man, too, but  he still clung to his great idea.  So he sent his brother Bartholomew  to England to beg King Henry VII to help him, while he himself  turned towards Spain.  Bartholomew, however, reached England in an  evil hour for his quest.  For Henry VII had but newly wrested the  crown from Richard III, and so had no thought to spare for unknown  lands.  Christopher also arrived in Spain at an unfortunate time.  For the Spaniards were carrying on a fierce warfare against the  Moors, and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had little thought  or money to spare for any other undertaking.  Therefore, although  Ferdinand listened to what Columbus had to say, for the time being  he could promise no help.    So years passed.  Columbus remained in Spain.  For in spite of all  his rebuffs and disappointments he did not despair.  As the court  moved from place to place he followed it, hoping always that the  day would come when the King and Queen would listen to him, and  believe in his great enterprise.    Meanwhile he lived in want and misery, and just kept himself from  starvation by making and selling maps.  To the common people he  seemed a madman, and as he passed through the streets in his worn  and threadbare garments children jeered and pointed fingers of  scorn at him.    Yet in spite of mockery and derision Columbus clung to his faith.  Indeed it burned in him so strongly that at length he made others  share it too, and men who were powerful at court became his friends.    At last the war with the Moors ended victoriously for Spain.  Then  these friends persuaded Queen Isabella to listen again to what  Columbus had to say.  To this the Queen consented, and when she  heard how poor Columbus was she sent him some money, so that he  might buy clothes fit to appear at court.    When Columbus heard the good news he was overjoyed.  As quickly as  might be he bought new clothes, and mounting upon a mule he rode  towards Granada.  But when Columbus arrived he found the court  still in the midst of rejoicings to celebrate victory.  Among  the light-hearted, gaily dressed throng there was no one who had  a thought to spare for the melancholy, white-haired dreamer who  passed like a dark shadow amidst them.  With his fate, as it were,  trembling in the balance, Columbus had no heart for rejoicing.  So  he looked on \"with indifference, almost with contempt.\"    But at length his day came.  At length all the jubilation was over,  and Ferdinand and Isabella turned their thoughts to Columbus.  He  came before them and talked so earnestly of his great project that  they could not but believe in it.  The day was won.  Both King and  Queen, but more especially the Queen, were willing to help the  great enterprise.  Now"]]]
