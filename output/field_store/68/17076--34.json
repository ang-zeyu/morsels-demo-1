They were descending too quickly.  There was no room for doubt. Much too quickly.    The Merchant said, peevishly, \"Why do you keep silence?\"    \"Well, then, if you wish me to speak, I would suggest that you strap on  your Floater and help me prepare the Ejector.\"    The Pilot fought a noble fight. He was no beginner. The atmosphere,  abnormally high and thick in the gravitational potential of this world  whipped and burned about the ship, but to the very last it looked as  though he might bring it under control despite that.    He even maintained course, following the extrapolated line to the point  on the northern continent toward which they were headed. Under other  circumstances, with a shade more luck, the story would eventually have  been told and retold as a heroic and masterly reversal of a lost  situation. But within sight of victory, tired body and tired nerves  clamped a control bar with a shade too much pressure. The ship, which  had almost levelled off, dipped down again.    There was no room to retrieve the final error. There was only a mile  left to fall. The Pilot remained at his post to the actual landing, his  only thought that of breaking the force of the crash, of maintaining the  spaceworthiness of the vessel. He did not survive. With the ship bucking  madly in a soupy atmosphere, few Ejectors could be mobilized and only  one of them in time.    When afterwards, the Explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose  to his feet, he had the definite feeling that but for himself and  the Merchant, there were no survivors. And perhaps that was an  over-calculation. His Floater had burnt out while still sufficiently  distant from surface to have the fall stun him. The Merchant might have  had less luck, even, than that.    He was surrounded by a world of thick, ropy stalks of grass, and in the  distance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on  his native Arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high  above what he would consider normal tree-tops.    He called, his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the Merchant  answered. The Explorer made his way toward him, thrusting violently at  the coarse stalks that barred his path.    \"Are you hurt?\" he asked.    The Merchant grimaced. \"I've sprained something. It hurts to walk.\"    The Explorer probed gently. \"I don't think anything is broken. You'll  have to walk despite the pain.\"    \"Can't we rest first?\"    \"It's important to try to find the ship. If it is spaceworthy or if it  can be repaired, we may live. Otherwise, we won't.\"    \"Just a few minutes. Let me catch my breath.\"    The Explorer was glad enough for those few minutes. The Merchant's eyes  were already closed. He allowed his to do the same.    He heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open. Never sleep on a  strange planet, he told himself futilely.    The Merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of  terror.    The Explorer called, \"It's only a native of this planet. It won't harm  you.\"    But even as he spoke, the giant had swooped down and in a moment they  were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.    The Merchant struggled violently and, of course, quite futilely. \"Can't  you talk to it?\" he yelled.    The Explorer could only shake his head. \"I can't reach it with the  Projector. It won't be listening.\"    \"Then blast it. Blast it down.\"    \"We can't do that.\" The phrase \"you fool\" had almost been added. The  Explorer struggled to keep his self-control. They were swallowing space  as the monster moved purposefully away.    \"Why not?\" cried the Merchant. \"You can reach your blaster. I see it in  plain sight. Don't be afraid of falling.\"    \"It's simpler than that. If this monster is killed, you'll never trade  with this planet. You'll never even leave it. You probably won't live  the day out.\"    \"Why? Why?\"    \"Because this is one of the young of the species. You should know what  happens when a trader kills a native young, even accidentally. What's  more, if this is the target-point, then we are on the estate of a  powerful native. This might be one of his brood.\"    That was how they entered their present prison. They had carefully burnt  away a portion of the thick, stiff covering and it was obvious that the  height from which they were suspended was a killing one.    Now, once again, the prison-cage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc.  The Merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake. The cover  lifted and light flooded in. As was the case the time before, there were  two specimens of the young. They were not very different in appearance  from adults of the species, reflected the Explorer, though, of course,  they were considerably smaller.    A handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars. Its odor  was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends.    The Merchant drew away and said, huskily, \"What are they doing?\"    The Explorer said, \"Trying to feed us, I should judge. At least this  seems to be the native equivalent of grass.\"    The cover was replaced and they were set swinging again, alone with  their fodder.      IV    Slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out  to be only Red.    He said, \"No one's around. I had my eye peeled, you bet.\"    Red said, \"Ssh. Look. You take this stuff and stick it in the cage. I've  got to scoot back to the house.\"    \"What is it?\" Slim reached reluctantly.    \"Ground meat. Holy Smokes, haven't you ever seen ground meat? That's  what you should've got when I sent you to the house instead of coming  back with that stupid grass.\"    Slim was hurt. \"How'd I know they don't eat grass. Besides, ground meat  doesn't come loose like that. It comes in cellophane and it isn't that  color.\"    \"Sure--in the city. Out here we grind our own and it's always this color  till it's cooked.\"    \"You mean it isn't cooked?\" Slim drew away quickly.    Red looked disgusted. \"Do you think animals eat _cooked_ food. Come on,  take it. It won't hurt you. I tell you there isn't much time.\"    \"Why? What's doing back at the house?\"    \"I don't know. Dad and your father are walking around. I think maybe  they're looking for me. Maybe the cook told them I took the meat.  Anyway, we don't want them coming here after me.\"    \"Didn't you ask the cook before you took this stuff?\"    \"Who? That crab? Shouldn't wonder if she only let me have a drink of  water because Dad makes her. Come on. Take it.\"    Slim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch.  He turned toward the barn and Red sped away in the direction from which  he had come.    He slowed when he approached the two adults, took a few deep breaths to  bring himself back to normal, and then carefully and nonchalantly  sauntered past. (They were walking in the general direction of the barn,  he noticed, but not dead on.)    He said, \"Hi, Dad. Hello, sir.\"    The Industrialist said, \"Just a moment, Red. I have a question to ask  you?\"    Red turned a carefully blank face to his father. \"Yes, Dad?\"    \"Mother tells me you were out early this morning.\"    \"Not real early, Dad. Just a little before breakfast.\"    \"She said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the  night and didn't go back to sleep.\"    Red waited before answering. Should he have told Mom that?    Then he said, \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What was it that awakened you?\"    Red saw no harm in it. He said, \"I don't know, Dad. It sounded like  thunder, sort of, and like a collision, sort of.\"    \"Could you tell where it came from?\"    \"It _sounded_ like it was out by the hill.\" That was truthful, and  useful as well, since the direction was almost opposite that in which  the barn lay.    The Industrialist looked at his guest. \"I suppose it would do no harm to  walk toward the hill.\"    The Astronomer said, \"I am ready.\"    Red watched them walk away and when he turned he saw Slim peering  cautiously out from among the briars of a hedge.    Red waved at him. \"Come on.\"    Slim stepped out and approached. \"Did they say anything about the meat?\"    \"No. I guess they don't know about that. They went down to the hill.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Search me. They kept asking about the noise I heard. Listen, did the  animals eat the meat?\"    \"Well,\" said Slim, cautiously, \"they were sort of _looking_ at it and  smelling it or something.\"    \"Okay,\" Red said, \"I guess they'll eat it. Holy Smokes, they've got to  eat _something_. Let's walk along toward the hill and see what Dad and  your father are going to do.\"    \"What about the animals?\"    \"They'll be all right. A fellow can't spend all his time on them. Did  you give them water?\"    \"Sure. They drank that.\"    \"See. Come on. We'll look at them after lunch. I tell you what. We'll  bring them fruit. Anything'll eat fruit.\"    Together they trotted up the rise, Red, as usual, in the lead.      V    The Astronomer said, \"You think the noise was their ship landing?\"    \"Don't you think it could be?\"    \"If it were, they may all be dead.\"    \"Perhaps not.\" The Industrialist frowned.    \"If they have landed, and are still alive, where are they?\"    \"Think about that for a while.\" He was still frowning.    The Astronomer said, \"I don't understand you.\"    \"They may not be friendly.\"    \"Oh, no. I've spoken with them. They've--\"    \"You've spoken with them. Call that reconnaissance. What would their  next step be? Invasion?\"    \"But they only have one ship, sir.\"    \"You know that only because they say so. They might have a fleet.\"    \"I've told you about their size. They--\"    \"Their size would not matter, if they have handweapons that may well be  superior to our artillery.\"    \"That is not what I meant.\"    \"I had this partly in mind from the first.\" The Industrialist went on.  \"It is for that reason I agreed to see them after I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31570"],[0,"A Taxonomic Study of the Middle American Snake, Pituophis deppei (#3)"],[1,"like the adults.    _Variation._--Specimens from the southern part of the range in Oaxaca  have 229 to 245 ventrals (average 238.3); to the north on the Mexican  Plateau in the state of Michoac['a]n seven specimens have 231 to 243  (average 237.1) ventrals. In the relatively isolated mountain ranges of  the Sierra del Sur in Guerrero and the Sierra de Coalcom['a]n in  southern Michoac['a]n the ranges of variation and average numbers of  ventrals are, respectively, 234 to 258 (245.8) and 236 to 246 (242.2).  The longest neck-stripes are found in specimens from Oaxaca and  Guerrero; nevertheless, some specimens from the Mexican Plateau in  Michoac['a]n and three of the four specimens from the Sierra de  Coalcom['a]n have neck-stripes equally long. One specimen from 40  kilometers north of Ciudad M['e]xico and several from the vicinity of  Tanc['i]taro, Michoac['a]n, have rather shorter neck-stripes. One  specimen from Dos Aguas, Michoac['a]n, has the neck-stripes partially  fragmented into rows of spots as in _gibsoni_.    On the basis of specimens from Tanc['i]taro, Michoac['a]n, Schmidt and  Shannon (1947: 79) described the subspecies _brevilineata_, which they  diagnosed as differing from _lineaticollis_ in having fewer ventrals and  shorter neck-stripes. The present data suggest that the characters used  to diagnose the subspecies are variable not only in Michoac['a]n, but  throughout the range of the species. Consequently, _Pituophis (deppei)  brevilineata_ Schmidt and Shannon (1947) is placed in the synonymy of  _Pituophis lineaticollis lineaticollis_ Cope (1861).    _Distribution._--The southern part of the Mexican Plateau in the states  of Michoac['a]n, M['e]xico, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcom['a]n in  southern Michoac['a]n, and the Sierra del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca.    _Specimens examined._--Total of 25, as follows: _Guerrero_: Acahuizotla,  USNM 46537; Chilpancingo, CNHM 38356-9, UIMNH 35000, UMMZ 85724-5;  Omiltemi, USNM 46462. _M['e]xico_: 40 km.

Washington,       vol. 67, p. 172, August 5, 1954.    _Type._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 107060, obtained  by Colvin Gibson. Type locality: Yepocapa, Chimaltenango, Guatemala.    _Diagnosis._--This race is characterized by paired, elongated,  pale-centered, paravertebral spots on the anterior part of the body.  Posterior to the paired spots are 22 to 27 dorsal body-blotches; these  and the lateral intercalary spots have pale centers. There are 234 to  246 ventrals and 57 to 65 caudals.    _Variation._--The few specimens that are available from a small  geographic area do not permit a discussion of geographic variation at  this time. All of the specimens have the paired paravertebral spots and  blotches with light centers. In this respect the population of  _lineaticollis_ east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is noticeably  different from the nominal subspecies in the Mexican highlands. Smith  and Taylor (1945: 108) listed a specimen from San Cristobal, Chiapas. I  have not seen this specimen and so do not know to which subspecies it  belongs. On geographical grounds it probably is _gibsoni_.    _Distribution._--Guatemalan highlands and probably highlands of Chiapas.  Aside from the specimens examined, two others are known--one from  Volc['a]n Agua, Sacatepequez (Slevin, 1939: 400), and one from  Due[~n]as, Sacatepequez (Boulenger, 1894: 65); these localities are not  shown in figure 1.    _Specimens examined._--Eight, as follows: Guatemala: _Chimaltenango_:  Chichavac, CNHM 1927; Finca El Tesoro, 3 km. SE of Acatenango, UMMZ  107062-3; Finca Recreo, 4.5 km. SW of Yepocapa, UMMZ 107381; R['i]o Los  Positos, 5.5 km. NE of Yepocapa, UMMZ 107061; R['i]o Sobolopop, 8 km.
