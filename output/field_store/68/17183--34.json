The mellow, bland,       and sunny luxuriance of her home society--its good       fellowship, its hearty and constitutional       _companionableness_, the thriftless gayety of the people,       their dogged but amiable invincibility of opinion, and that       overflowing hospitality which knew no ebb--these traits,       though far from being impaired, are modified at the present       day by circumstances which have been gradually attaining a       marked influence over social life as well as political       relation. An observer cannot fail to note that the manners       of our country have been tending towards a uniformity which       is visibly effacing all local differences. The old states,       especially, are losing their original distinctive habits and       modes of life, and in the same degree, I fear, are losing       their exclusive American character. A traveller may detect       but few sectional or provincial varieties in the general       observances and customs of society, in comparison with what       were observable in the past generations, and the pride, or       rather the vanity, of the present day is leading us into a       very notable assimilation with foreign usages. The country       now apes the city in what is supposed to be the elegancies       of life, and the city is inclined to value and adopt the       fashions it is able to import across the Atlantic, and thus       the whole surface of society is exhibiting the traces of a       process by which it is likely to be rubbed down, in time, to       one level, and varnished with the same gloss. It may thus       finally arrive at a comfortable insipidity of character       which may not be willingly reckoned as altogether a due       compensation for the loss of that rough but pleasant flavor       which belonged to it in its earlier era. There is much good       sense in that opinion which ascribes a wholesome influence       to those homebred customs, which are said to strengthen       local attachments and expand them into love of country. What       belonged to us as characteristically American, seems already       to be dissolving into a mixture which affects us       unpleasantly as a plain and cosmopolitan substitute for the       old warmth and salient vivacity of our ancestors. We no       longer present in our pictures of domestic life so much as       an earnest lover of our nationality might desire of what       abroad is called the \"red bird's wing\"--something which       belongs to us and to no one else. The fruitfulness of modern       invention in the arts of life, the general fusion of thought       through the medium of an extra-territorial literature, which       from its easy domestication among us is scarcely regarded as       foreign, the convenience and comfort of European customs       which have been incorporated into our scheme of living,--all       these, aided and diffused by our extraordinary facilities of       travel and circulation, have made sad work, even in the       present generation, with those old _nationalisms_ that were       so agreeable to the contemplation of an admirer of the       picturesque in character and manners.    [Illustration: THE \"SWALLOW BARN.\"]         \"Looking myself somewhat hopelessly upon this onward gliding       of the stream, I am not willing to allow these sketches of       mine entirely to pass away. They have already begun to       assume the tints of a relic of the past, and may, in another       generation, become archaeological, and sink into the chapter       of antiquities. Presenting, as I make bold to say, a       faithful picture of the people, the modes of life, and the       scenery of a region full of attraction, and exhibiting the       lights and shades of its society with the truthfulness of a       painter who has studied his subject on the spot, they may       reasonably claim their accuracy of delineation to be set off       as an extenuation for any want of skill or defect of finish       which a fair criticism may charge against the artist. Like       some sign-post painters, I profess to make a strong       likeness, even if it should be thought to be _hard_,--and       what better workmen might call a daub,--as to which I must       leave my reader to judge for himself when he has read this       book. The outward public award on this point was kind, and       bestowed quite as much praise as I could have desired--much       more than I expected--when the former edition appeared. But       \"the progress\" has brought out many competitors since that       day, and has, perhaps, rendered the public taste more       scrupulous. A book then was not so perilous an offering as       it is now in the great swarm of authorships. We run more       risk, just now, of being left alone--unread--untalked       of--though not, happily, unpuffed by newspapers, who are       favorites with the publisher, and owe him courtesies.         \"I wish it to be noted that Swallow Barn is not a novel. I       confess this in advance, although I may lose by it. It was       begun on the plan of a series of detached sketches linked       together by the hooks and eyes of a traveller's notes; and       although the narrative does run into some by-paths of       personal adventure, it has still preserved its desultory,       sketchy character to the last. It is, therefore, utterly       unartistic in plot and structure, and may be described as       variously and interchangeably partaking of the complexion of       a book of travels, a diary, a collection of letters, a       drama, and a history,--and this, serial or compact, as the       reader may choose to compute it. Our old friend Polonius had       nearly hit it in his rigmarole of 'pastoral-comical,       tragical-comical-historical-pastoral'--which, saving 'the       tragical,' may well make up my schedule: and so I leave it       to the 'censure' of my new reader.\"    [Illustration: VIRGINIA MILL-BOYS RACING.]    Here the history of the book is admirably told. The work itself, so  full of truthful and effective pictures, offers numerous passages for  quotation, but though we have nothing better to give our readers, we  shall limit our extracts to a few scenes illustrated by Mr. Strother's  pencil. We present first the old barn itself.         \"Beyond the bridge, at some distance, stands a prominent       object in the perspective of this picture,--the most       venerable appendage to the establishment--a huge barn with       an immense roof hanging almost to the ground, and thatched a       foot thick with sunburnt straw, which reaches below the       eaves in ragged flakes. It has a singularly drowsy and       decrepit aspect. The yard around it is strewed knee-deep       with litter, from the midst of which arises a long rack       resembling a chevaux de frise, which is ordinarily filled       with fodder. This is the customary lounge of half a score of       oxen and as many cows, who sustain an imperturbable       companionship with a sickly wagon, whose parched tongue and       drooping swingle-trees, as it stands in the sun, give it a       most forlorn and invalid character; whilst some sociable       carts under the sheds, with their shafts perched against the       walls, suggest the idea of a set of gossiping cronies taking       their ease in a tavern porch. Now and then a clownish       hobble-de-hoy colt, with long fetlocks and disordered mane,       and a thousand burs in his tail, stalks through this       company. But as it is forbidden ground to all his tribe, he       is likely very soon to encounter a shower of corn-cobs from       some of the negro men; upon which contingency he makes a       rapid retreat across the bars which imperfectly guard the       entrance to the yard, and with an uncouth display of his       heels bounds towards the brook, where he stops and looks       back with a saucy defiance; and after affecting to drink for       a moment, gallops away with a braggart whinny to the       fields.\"    The life led by the young negroes on the plantations of Virginia is  generally easy, and of course utterly free from the cares which beset  their youthful masters, compelled to pore over \"miserable books.\"         \"There is a numerous herd of little negroes about the       estate; and these sometimes afford us a new diversion. A few       mornings since we encountered a horde of them, who were       darting about the bushes like untamed monkeys. They are       afraid of me because I am a stranger, and take to their       heels as soon as they see me. If I ever chance to get near       enough to speak to one of them, he stares at me with a       suspicious gaze, and, after a moment, makes off at full       speed, very much frightened, towards the cabins at some       distance from the house. They are almost all clad in a long       coarse shirt which reaches below the knee, without any other       garment. But one of the group we met on the morning I speak       of, was oddly decked in a pair of ragged trowsers,       conspicuous for their ample dimensions in the seat. These       had evidently belonged to some grown-up person, but were cut       short in the legs to make them fit the wearer. A piece of       twine across the shoulder of this grotesque imp, served for       suspenders, and kept his habiliments from falling about his       feet. Ned ordered this crew to prepare for a foot-race, and       proposed a reward of a piece of money to the winner. They       were to run from a given point, about a hundred paces       distant, to the margin of the brook. Our whole suite of dogs       were in attendance, and seemed to understand our pastime.

Its history, (#3)"],[1,"attention.    Other tests, similar to these experiments, were applied to dogs, horses,  and horned cattle. A lean and scraggy dog, covered with parasites and  eruptions, with eyes running foul humour, a dog which could neither run  nor stand, and which was reduced to the last stage of wasting marasmus,  was rescued from the jaws of death and thoroughly cured without special  treatment, by the sole influence of a rich restorative diet. This dog  afterwards became a fine hunting hound, beautiful in shape, and  admirable for his sportive attributes.    These experiments having been submitted to the judgment of the Academie  des Sciences in Paris, were honoured with its approval, and the reports  concerning them were printed at the Academy's expense, and crowned at  the competitive examination.    The vital resistance of horned cattle is so feeble, that those animals  which are periodically exhibited in the north of London, though  certainly chosen from among the most healthy and robust, could not herd  together in large numbers for the space of a month in the Agricultural  Hall at Islington, without sinking under infectious and contagious  diseases--almost one and all. Under the conditions in which we see them  in that Show, a single month would be sufficient to produce almost their  complete destruction; for even a single week, which is the usual  duration of their confinement, affects them so much as to render a large  proportion of them unhealthy.    Every one knows how apt cavalry horses are to sicken and die off during  a campaign. Every one has heard of the fearful ravages amongst the  horses of the Allied armies during the Crimean war, when many companies  were dismounted owing to this mortality.    Let us now transport ourselves in thought into the middle of those  immense steppes where vast and innumerable herds of herbivorous animals  are being bred for our supply, and consider what will be the effects on  their health and life if they should be afflicted with a scarcity of  forage, in consequence of this long dry summer.    It is unnecessary to say that there exist in Russia, in Hungary, in  Australia, in North and South America, and in many other parts of the  globe, large tracts of country which are still uninhabited, whose  uncultivated soil supplies with food great numbers of sheep and cattle.  These spacious tracts, known as moorlands or steppes, particularly  abound in Russia, on the banks of the Wolga, the Don, the Dnieper; in  Hungary, on the banks of the Danube; and also in South America, in the  republics of Venezuela, New Granada, Columbia, &c.    Now, in hot and rainy seasons these steppes teem with rich and luxuriant  verdure; the plants growing up in the marshes are prolific and abundant,  and even those parts of the wild moors which produce nothing but heath  are capable of feeding and fattening flocks and herds.    Under conditions so auspicious as these, animals may still suffer, but  in what way? By excess of food, or repletion. They are in general robust  and healthy, and thus fortified they inhale without detriment the  deleterious gases of oxygen with carbon, carburetted hydrogen and the  like, exhaled by the plants which grow out of the swampy soils. Thus  protected, too, they are proof against the fluctuations of the seasons,  and against every injury which threatens them; and their strong and  sound condition enables them to sustain the fatigues of their long and  arduous journeys, and to supply the rich countries of the West with  their flesh, fleece, and hides.    When the seasons have thus conveyed a due proportion of heat, water, and  electricity to the elements of the soil, both plants and animals conduce  to the comfort and health of man, and fulfil his expectations. But the  laws of nature are involved in mystery. Good and evil go hand in  hand--death and life travel close together--and a few years of  prosperous harvests are almost invariably followed by blight,  barrenness, and scarcity. Most men think only of the present time, and  this imprudence and want of foresight prevent farmers and great cattle  proprietors from collecting and holding in reserve the requisite stores  of sustenance to supply their sheep and oxen during these barren  seasons. Sickness then breaks out, and these helpless creatures perish  in vast numbers, to the detriment of their owners' best interests.    And truly, when continual rains cause the rivers to overflow, when the  plains are drenched and soaked, or when a burning sun scorches the  ground, herbivorous animals wander in vain from field to field in quest  of sustenance to restore their strength, or of pure and healthy water to  slake their thirst; their vital resistance dwindles away, deleterious  gases poison and bewilder them, their blood is debased, and as Ovid  says,      \"Corpora foeda jacent, vitiantur odoribus herbae.\"    And since these mild and harmless animals, which seem to have been  created merely to clothe us, and to nourish us with their milk and  flesh, have not been endowed by nature either with the intelligence, or  the activity, or the cunning, or the invention, or the skill bestowed on  the omnivorous and carnivorous species, hard is their fate under the  pressing needs of hunger. Peaceful creatures, they browse in vain on  deleterious plants on a sterile soil; their external and internal  teguments now afford a favourable seat for the propagation of  parasites--for the _parasitogenia_; and soon after a general _adynamia_,  or relaxation of the fibres, delivers them up without resistance to the  morbific elements of the infectious diseases to which they are exposed,  where the languishing, the sick, and the rotting are herded together,  and they are carried off by hecatombs by this wasteful and devouring  typhus.      II.    We may readily conclude, from these general observations on infectious  and contagious diseases, that they must have existed in all former ages;  and if in our present advanced state of civilization they are so  destructive, we may be sure that in those remote periods they must have  been, both as regards man as well as the brute creation, the cause of  general extermination, in whatever parts of the earth they prevailed.  And indeed, whenever we refer to ancient or modern history, we are  continually struck with the analogy which exists between the epidemic  diseases signalized by the general name of PLAGUE, and which  decimated all the living beings, and those which more recently, and at  the present moment, have startled the world by their fatal effects on  men and animals.    Moreover, we cannot too often repeat the fact--in order that those  documents relating to the past which contain useful instruction may be  examined and searched into--that the physiological and pathological laws  which rule and determine the phenomena of organic matter, whether in  health or sickness, were, like the laws of chemistry, electricity, and  astronomy, originally established at the time of creation, and that  matter submits with passive obedience to the laws of transformation and  transubstantiation, which are the absolute condition of life. These are  the eternal laws of which a synthesis so admirable is furnished by the  Gospel, in this short injunction, \"_Take, eat, this is my body; drink,  this is my blood._\"    Now, if man, who is the sovereign master of this matter, did not take  care to regulate and modify it for his own benefit and the benefit of  all living creatures on whom his own life depends, as well as his wealth  and happiness; if he did not seek thereby continually to diminish the  sum of evil, and to extend the sum of good which it is his mission to  increase, he would violate these laws, which are inherent in matter, and  which have existed for his use since the creation of the world.    We must likewise believe that those PLAGUES which are spoken of  in the Bible, those which Homer alludes to, that which is related by  Plutarch, and which succeeded the general drought in 753 before Christ;  those mentioned by Titus Livius, Virgil, Ovid, and other Latin authors,  the most virulent of which plagues raged in the years 310, 212, and 178  of the Foundation of Rome, resembled the epidemics or plagues which are  witnessed in our own day.    The plague of 212 swept away all the inhabitants of Sicily, cattle as  well as men; that of 178 destroyed all the priests, who sought in vain  for victims free from the contagion, to offer them up as sacrifices to  the offended Gods.    Cecilius Severus gives a most striking description of a pestilential  disease which, in 376 A.D., swept away all the cattle in  Europe. Judging from his account of that scourge, we may fairly believe  that the distemper he has described was identically the same as the one  which has just broken out in England. \"A universal distaste, sudden  dejection, vertigoes, spasmodic tension in the limbs, _a painful_  _swelling of the lower belly_, violent affections of the nerves, sudden  death--everything shows the presence of a pestilential ferment, which  irritates the solids, infects and vitiates the fluids, which is the  cause of the putrefaction of the humours, manifested by the swelling of  the lower belly, which in that case depends on a putrid fermentation so  as to disengage air.\"    A piece of iron, representing the sign of the Cross, was heated in the  fire, and when red-hot was applied to the forehead of the sick animals;  and this remedy was looked upon at that time as the most effectual they  could apply.    Gregoire de Tours makes mention of an epidemic, the result of a long dry  summer, which, in 592, was very fatal in its havoc, sparing no living  creature whatever.    Andre Duchesne, in his \"History of England,\" speaks of an epidemic  which, in 1316, during the reign of Edward II., owed its origin, on the  contrary, to a long season of rains.    The celebrated physicians Ramazzini and Lancisi relate that in 1711,"]]]
