CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY REMARKS--GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF BREEDING, NUTRITION,  MANAGEMENT, &c.      The principal domestic animals reared for economical purposes in the  United States, are Horned or neat cattle, the Horse, the Mule, Sheep,  and Swine. A few Asses are bred, but for no other object than to keep up  the supply of jacks for propagating mules. We have also goats, rabbits,  and the house domestics, the dog and cat; the two former, only in very  limited numbers, but both the latter much beyond our legitimate wants.  There have been a few specimens of the Alpaca imported, and an  arrangement is now in progress for the introduction of a flock of  several hundred, which, if distributed among intelligent and wealthy  agriculturists, as proposed, will test their value for increasing our  agricultural resources. We shall confine ourselves to some general  considerations, connected with the first-mentioned and most important of  our domestic animals.    Their number as shown by the agricultural statistics collected in 1839,  by order of our General Government, was 15,000,000 neat cattle;  4,335,000 horses and mules, (the number of each not being specified;)  19,311,000 sheep; and 26,300,000 swine. There is much reason to question  the entire accuracy of these returns, yet there is doubtless an  approximation to the truth. Sheep have greatly increased since that  period, and would probably number, the present year, (1848,) not less  than 30,000,000; and if our own manufactures continue to thrive, and we  should moreover become wool exporters, of which there is now a  reasonable prospect, an accurate return for 1850, will undoubtedly give  us not less than 33,000,000 for the entire Union. There has been a great  increase in the value of the other animals enumerated, but not in a  ratio corresponding with that of sheep. This is not only manifest in  their augmented numbers, but in the gradual and steady improvement of  the species.    It may be safely predicted, that this improvement will not only be  sustained, but largely increased; for there are some intelligent and  spirited breeders to be found in every section of the country, whose  liberal exertions and successful examples are doing much for this  object. Wherever intelligence and sound judgment are to be found, it  will be impossible long to resist the effects of a comparison between  animals, which, on an equal quantity of the same food, with the same  attention and in the same time, will return 50, 20, or even 10 per cent.  more in their intrinsic value or marketable product, than the ordinary  class. This improvement has been, relatively, most conspicuous in the  Western and Southern states; not that the present average of excellence  in their animals surpasses, or even reaches that of the North and East;  but the latter have long been pursuing this object, with more or less  energy, and they have for many years had large numbers of excellent  specimens of each variety; while with few exceptions, if we exclude the  blood-horse or racing nag, the former have, till recently, paid  comparatively little attention to the improvement of their domestic  animals. The spirit for improvement through extensive sections, is now  awakened, and the older settled portions of the country may hereafter  expect competitors, whose success will be fully commensurate with their  own. Before going into the management of the different varieties, we  will give some general principles and remarks applicable to the  treatment of all.    _The purpose for which animals are required_, should be first  determined, before selecting such as may be necessary either for  breeding or use. Throughout the Northeastern states, cows for the dairy,  oxen for the yoke, and both for the butcher, are wanted. In much of the  West and South, beef alone is the principal object; while the dairy is  neglected, and the work of the ox is seldom relied on, except for  occasional drudgery.    Sheep may be wanted almost exclusively for the fleece, or for the fleece  and heavy mutton, or in the neighborhood of markets, for large early  lambs. The pastures and winter food, climate, and other conditions,  present additional circumstances, which should be well considered before  determining on the particular breed, either of cattle or sheep, that  will best promote the interest of the farmer.    The kind of work for which the horse may be wanted, whether as a  roadster, for the saddle, as a heavy team horse, or the horse of all  work, must be first decided, before selecting the form or character of  the animal.    The range of pig excellence is more circumscribed, as it is only  necessary to breed such as will yield the greatest amount of valuable  carcass, within the shortest time, and with the least expense.      PRINCIPLES OF BREEDING.    All breeding is founded on the principle, that _like begets like_. This  is, however, liable to some exceptions, and is much more generally true  when _breeding down_ than when _breeding up_. If two animals (which can  never be exactly similar in all respects) are requisite to the  perpetuation of the species, it necessarily results, that the progeny  must differ in a more or less degree from each parent. With wild  animals, and such of the domestic as are allowed to propagate without  the interference of art, and whose habits, treatment, and food are  nearly similar to their natural condition, the change through successive  generations is scarcely perceptible. It is only when we attempt to  improve their good qualities, that it is essential carefully to  determine, and rigidly to apply, what are adopted as the present  scientific principles of breeding. We cannot believe that we have  penetrated beyond the mere threshold of this art. Unless, then, we  launch into experiments, which are necessarily attended with  uncertainty, our duty will be, to take for our guide the most successful  practice of modern times, until further discoveries enable us to modify  or add to such as are already known and adopted. We may assume, then, as  the present rules for this art,    1st. That the animals selected for breed, should unite in themselves all  the good qualities we wish to perpetuate in the offspring.    2d. These qualities, technically called _points_, should be inbred in  the animals as far as practicable, by a long line of descent from  parents similarly constituted. The necessity for this rule is evident  from the fact, that in mixing different species, and especially  mongrels, with a long-established breed, the latter will most strongly  stamp the issue with its own peculiarities. This is forcibly illustrated  in the case of the Devon cattle, an ancient race, whose color, form, and  characteristics are strikingly perpetuated, sometimes to the sixth or  even a later generation. So far is this principle carried by many  experienced breeders, that they will use an animal of indifferent  external appearance, but of approved descent, (_blood_,) in preference  to a decidedly superior one, whose pedigree is imperfect.    3d. All the conditions of soil, situation, climate, treatment, and food,  should be favorable to the object sought.    4th. As a general rule, the female should be relatively larger than the  male. This gives ample room for the perfect development of the f[oe]tus,  easy parturition, and a large supply of milk for the offspring, at a  period in its existence, when food has a greater influence in perfecting  character and form, than at any subsequent time.    5th. Exceptions to this rule may be made, when greater size is required  than can be obtained from the female, and especially when more vigor and  hardiness of constitution are desirable. For this purpose, strong  masculine development in the sire is proper, and if otherwise  unattainable, something of coarseness may be admitted, as this may be  afterwards corrected, and nothing will atone for want of constitution  and strength.    6th. Pairing should be with a strict reference to correcting the  imperfections of one animal, by a corresponding excellence in the other.    7th. _Breeding in-and-in_, or propagating from animals nearly allied,  may be tolerated under certain circumstances, though seldom; and only in  extreme cases between those of the same generation, as brother and  sister. When the animal possesses much stamina and peculiar merit, which  it is desired to perpetuate in the breed, it may be done either in the  ascending or descending line, as in breeding the son to the parent, or  the parent to his own progeny. This has been practised with decided  advantage, and in some cases has even been continued"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#3)"],[1,"partitions consisting of little round disks of sorghum, or  Indian millet, about half a centimetre thick. (About one-fifth of an  inch.--Translator's Note.) This is a white pith, divested of its fibrous  wrapper and easy for the Osmia's mandibles to attack. My diaphragms are  much thicker than the natural partitions; this is an advantage, as we  shall see. In any case, I could not well use thinner ones, for these  disks must be able to withstand the pressure of the rammer which places  them in position in the tube. On the other hand, the experiment showed  me that the Osmia makes short work of the material when it is a case of  drilling a hole through it.    To keep out the light, which would disturb my insects destined to spend  their larval life in complete darkness, I cover the tube with a thick  paper sheath, easy to remove and replace when the time comes for  observation. Lastly, the tubes thus prepared and containing either  Osmiae or other bramble-dwellers are hung vertically, with the opening  at the top, in a snug corner of my study. Each of these appliances  fulfils the natural conditions pretty satisfactorily: the cocoons from  the same bramble-stick are stacked in the same order which they occupied  in the native shaft, the oldest at the bottom of the tube and the  youngest close to the orifice; they are isolated by means of partitions;  they are placed vertically, head upwards; moreover, my device has  the advantage of substituting for the opaque wall of the bramble a  transparent wall which will enable me to follow the hatching day by day,  at any moment which I think opportune.    The male Osmia splits his cocoon at the end of June and the female at  the beginning of July. When this time comes, we must redouble our watch  and inspect the tubes several times a day if we would obtain exact  statistics of the births. Well, during the six years that I have studied  this question, I have seen and seen again, ad nauseam; and I am in a  position to declare that there is no order governing the sequence of  hatchings, absolutely none. The first cocoon to burst may be the one at  the bottom of the tube, the one at the top, the one in the middle or  in any other part, indifferently. The second to be split may adjoin the  first or it may be removed from it by a number of spaces, either above  or below. Sometimes several hatchings occur on the same day, within the  same hour, some farther back in the row of cells, some farther forward;  and this without any apparent reason for the simultaneity. In short, the  hatchings follow upon one another, I will not say haphazard--for each  of them has its appointed place in time, determined by impenetrable  causes--but at any rate contrary to our calculations, based on this or  the other consideration.    Had we not been deceived by our too shallow logic, we might have  foreseen this result. The eggs are laid in their respective cells at  intervals of a few days, of a few hours. How can this slight difference  in age affect the total evolution, which lasts a year? Mathematical  accuracy has nothing to do with the case. Each germ, each grub has its  individual energy, determined we know not how and varying in each germ  or grub. This excess of vitality belongs to the egg before it leaves the  ovary. Might it not, at the moment of hatching, be the cause why this  or that larva takes precedence of its elders or its juniors, chronology  being altogether a secondary consideration? When the hen sits upon her  eggs, is the oldest always the first to hatch? In the same way, the  oldest larva, lodged in the bottom storey, need not necessarily reach  the perfect state first.    A second argument, had we reflected more deeply on the matter, would  have shaken our faith in any strict mathematical sequence. The same  brood forming the string of cocoons in a bramble-stem contains  both males and females; and the two sexes are divided in the series  indiscriminately. Now it is the rule among the Bees for the males to  issue from the cocoon a little earlier than the females. In the case  of the Three-pronged Osmia, the male has about a week's start.  Consequently, in a populous gallery, there is always a certain number  of males, who are hatched seven or eight days before the females and who  are distributed here and there over the series. This would be enough to  make any regular hatching-sequence impossible in either direction.    These surmises accord with the facts: the chronological sequence of  the cells tells us nothing about the chronological sequence of the  hatchings, which take place without any definite order. There is,  therefore, no surrender of rights of primogeniture, as Leon Dufour  thought: each insect, regardless of the others, bursts its cocoon when  its time comes; and this time is determined by causes which escape our  notice and which, no doubt, depend upon the potentialities of the egg  itself. It is the case with the other bramble-dwellers which I have  subjected to the same test (Osmia detrita, Anthidium scapulare, Solenius  vagus, etc.); and it must also be the case with Odynerus rubicola: so  the most striking analogies inform us. Therefore the singular exception  which made such an impression on Dufour's mind is a sheer logical  illusion.    An error removed is tantamount to a truth gained; and yet, if it were  to end here, the result of my experiment would possess but slight value.  After destruction, let us turn to construction; and perhaps we shall  find the wherewithal to compensate us for an illusion lost. Let us begin  by watching the exit.    The first Osmia to leave her cocoon, no matter what place she occupies  in the series, forthwith attacks the ceiling separating her from the  floor above. She cuts a fairly clean hole in it, shaped like a truncate  cone, having its larger base on the side where the Bee is and its  smaller base opposite. This conformation of the exit-door is a  characteristic of the work. When the insect tries to attack the  diaphragm, it first digs more or less at random; then, as the boring  progresses, the action is concentrated upon an area which narrows  until it presents no more than just the necessary passage. Nor is the  cone-shaped aperture special to the Osmia: I have seen it made by the  other bramble-dwellers through my thick disks of sorghum-pith. Under  natural conditions, the partitions, which, for that matter, are very  thin, are destroyed absolutely, for the contraction of the cell at  the top leaves barely the width which the insect needs. The truncate,  cone-shaped breach has often been of great use to me. Its wide base made  it possible for me, without being present at the work, to judge which  of the two neighbouring Osmiae had pierced the partition; it told me the  direction of a nocturnal migration which I had been unable to witness.    The first-hatched Osmia, wherever she may be, has made a hole in her  ceiling. She is now in the presence of the next cocoon, with her head  at the opening of the hole. In front of her sister's cradle, she usually  stops, consumed with shyness; she draws back into her cell, flounders  among the shreds of the cocoon and the wreckage of the ruined ceiling;  she waits a day, two days, three days, more if necessary. Should  impatience gain the upper hand, she tries to slip between the wall of  the tunnel and the cocoon that blocks the way. She even undertakes the  laborious work of gnawing at the wall, so as to widen the interval, if  possible. We find these attempts, in the shaft of a bramble, at places  where the pith is removed down to the very wood, where the wood itself  is gnawed to some depth. I need hardly say that, although these lateral  inroads are perceptible after the event, they escape the eye at the  moment when they are being made.    If we would witness them, we must slightly modify the glass apparatus.  I line the inside of the tube with a thick piece of whity-brown  packing-paper, but only over one half of the circumference; the other  half is left bare, so that I may watch the Osmia's attempts. Well,  the captive insect fiercely attacks this lining, which to its eyes  represents the pithy layer of its usual abode; it tears it away by tiny  particles and strives to cut itself a road between the cocoon and the  glass wall. The males, who are a little smaller, have a better chance of  success than the females. Flattening themselves, making themselves thin,  slightly spoiling the shape of the cocoon, which, however, thanks to  its elasticity, soon recovers its first condition, they slip through the  narrow passage and reach the next cell. The females, when in a hurry  to get out, do as much, if they find the tube at all amenable to the  process. But no sooner is the first partition passed than a second  presents itself. This is pierced in its turn. In the same way will the  third be pierced and others after that, if the insect can manage them,  as long as its strength holds out. Too weak for these repeated borings,  the males do not go far through my thick plugs. If they contrive to cut  through the first, it is as much as they can do; and, even so, they  are far from always succeeding. But, in the conditions presented by  the native stalk, they have only feeble tissues to overcome; and then,  slipping, as I have said, between the cocoon and the wall, which is  slightly worn owing to the circumstances described, they are able to  pass through the remaining occupied chambers and to reach the outside  first, whatever their original place in the stack of cells. It is just  possible that their early eclosion forces this method of exit upon them,  a method which, though often attempted, does not always succeed. The  females, furnished with stronger tools, make greater progress in my  tubes. I see some who pierce three or four partitions, one after the  other, and are so many stages ahead before those whom they have left  behind are even hatched. While they are"]]]
