This is all very well for an hour or two;  but you can't balance yourself for a week.    George said:    \"Let's go up the river.\"    He said we should have fresh air, exercise and quiet; the constant change  of scene would occupy our minds (including what there was of Harris's);  and the hard work would give us a good appetite, and make us sleep well.    Harris said he didn't think George ought to do anything that would have a  tendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might be  dangerous.  He said he didn't very well understand how George was going  to sleep any more than he did now, seeing that there were only  twenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; but thought that  if he _did_ sleep any more, he might just as well be dead, and so save  his board and lodging.    Harris said, however, that the river would suit him to a \"T.\"  I don't  know what a \"T\" is (except a sixpenny one, which includes  bread-and-butter and cake _ad lib._, and is cheap at the price, if you  haven't had any dinner).  It seems to suit everybody, however, which is  greatly to its credit.    It suited me to a \"T\" too, and Harris and I both said it was a good idea  of George's; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that  we were surprised that George should have come out so sensible.    [Picture: Montmorency] The only one who was not struck with the  suggestion was Montmorency.  He never did care for the river, did  Montmorency.    \"It's all very well for you fellows,\" he says; \"you like it, but _I_  don't.  There's nothing for me to do.  Scenery is not in my line, and I  don't smoke.  If I see a rat, you won't stop; and if I go to sleep, you  get fooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard.  If you ask me, I  call the whole thing bally foolishness.\"    We were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.          CHAPTER II.      Plans discussed.--Pleasures of \"camping-out,\" on fine nights.--Ditto, wet  nights.--Compromise decided on.--Montmorency, first impressions  of.--Fears lest he is too good for this world, fears subsequently  dismissed as groundless.--Meeting adjourns.    We pulled out the maps, and discussed plans.    We arranged to start on the following Saturday from Kingston.  Harris and  I would go down in the morning, and take the boat up to Chertsey, and  George, who would not be able to get away from the City till the  afternoon (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day,  except Saturdays, when they wake him up and put him outside at two),  would meet us there.    Should we \"camp out\" or sleep at inns?    George and I were for camping out.  We said it would be so wild and free,  so patriarchal like.    Slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the  cold, sad clouds.  Silent, like sorrowing children, the birds have ceased  their song, and only the moorhen's plaintive cry and the harsh croak of  the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters, where the  dying day breathes out her last.    From the dim woods on either bank, Night's ghostly army, the grey  shadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering  rear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above the  waving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes; and Night, upon her  sombre throne, folds her black wings above the darkening world, and, from  her phantom palace, lit by the pale stars, reigns in stillness.                              [Picture: River scene]    Then we run our little boat into some quiet nook, and the tent is  pitched, and the frugal supper cooked and eaten.  Then the big pipes are  filled and lighted, and the pleasant chat goes round in musical  undertone; while, in the pauses of our talk, the river, playing round the  boat, prattles strange old tales and secrets, sings low the old child's  song that it has sung so many thousand years--will sing so many thousand  years to come, before its voice grows harsh and old--a song that we, who  have learnt to love its changing face, who have so often nestled on its  yielding bosom, think, somehow, we understand, though we could not tell  you in mere words the story that we listen to.    And we sit there, by its margin, while the moon, who loves it too, stoops  down to kiss it with a sister's kiss, and throws her silver arms around  it clingingly; and we watch it as it flows, ever singing, ever  whispering, out to meet its king, the sea--till our voices die away in  silence, and the pipes go out--till we, common-place, everyday young men  enough, feel strangely full of thoughts, half sad, half sweet, and do not  care or want to speak--till we laugh, and, rising, knock the ashes from  our burnt-out pipes, and say \"Good-night,\" and, lulled by the lapping  water and the rustling trees, we fall asleep beneath the great, still  stars, and dream that the world is young again--young and sweet as she  used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face,  ere her children's sins and follies had made old her loving heart--sweet  as she was in those bygone days when, a new-made mother, she nursed us,  her children, upon her own deep breast--ere the wiles of painted  civilization had lured us away from her fond arms, and the poisoned  sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life we led  with her, and the simple, stately home where mankind was born so many  thousands years ago.    Harris said:    \"How about when it rained?\"    You can never rouse Harris.  There is no poetry about Harris--no wild  yearning for the unattainable.  Harris never \"weeps, he knows not why.\"  If Harris's eyes fill with tears, you can bet it is because Harris has  been eating raw onions, or has put too much Worcester over his chop.    [Picture: Mermaid] If you were to stand at night by the sea-shore with  Harris, and say:    \"Hark! do you not hear?  Is it but the mermaids singing deep below the  waving waters; or sad spirits, chanting dirges for white corpses, held by  seaweed?\"  Harris would take you by the arm, and say:    \"I know what it is, old man; you've got a chill.  Now, you come along  with me.  I know a place round the corner here, where you can get a drop  of the finest Scotch whisky you ever tasted--put you right in less than  no time.\"    Harris always does know a place round the corner where you can get  something brilliant in the drinking line.  I believe that if you met  Harris up in Paradise (supposing such a thing likely), he would  immediately greet you with:    \"So glad you've come, old fellow; I've found a nice place round the  corner here, where you can get some really first-class nectar.\"    In the present instance, however, as regarded the camping out, his  practical view of the matter came as a very timely hint.  Camping out in  rainy weather is not pleasant.    It is evening.  You are wet through, and there is a good two inches of  water in the boat, and all the things are damp.  You find a place on the  banks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen, and you  land and lug out the tent, and two of you proceed to fix it.    It is soaked and heavy, and it flops about, and tumbles down on you, and  clings round your head and makes you mad.  The rain is pouring steadily  down all the time.  It is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry weather:  in wet, the task becomes herculean.  Instead of helping you, it seems to  you that the other man is simply playing the fool.  Just as you get your  side beautifully fixed, he gives it a hoist from his end, and spoils it  all.    \"Here! what are you up to?\" you call out.    \"What are _you_ up to?\" he retorts; \"leggo, can't you?\"    \"Don't pull it; you've got it all wrong, you stupid ass!\" you shout.    \"No, I haven't,\" he yells back; \"let go your side!\"    \"I tell you you've got it all wrong!\" you roar, wishing that you could  get at him; and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out.    \"Ah, the bally idiot!\" you hear him mutter to himself; and then comes a  savage haul, and away goes your side.  You lay down the mallet and start  to go round and tell him what you think about the whole business, and, at  the same time, he starts round in the same direction to come and explain  his views to you.  And you follow each other round and round, swearing at  one another, until the tent tumbles down in a heap, and leaves you  looking at each other across its ruins, when you both indignantly  exclaim, in the same breath:    \"There you are! what did I tell you?\"    Meanwhile the third man, who has been baling out the boat, and who has  spilled the water down his sleeve, and has been cursing away to himself  steadily for the last ten minutes, wants to know what the thundering  blazes you're playing at, and why the blarmed tent isn't up yet.    At last, somehow or other, it does get up, and you land the things.  It  is hopeless attempting to make a wood fire, so you light the methylated  spirit stove, and crowd round that.    Rainwater is the chief article of diet at supper.  The bread is  two-thirds rainwater, the beefsteak-pie is exceedingly rich in it, and  the jam, and the butter, and the salt, and the coffee have all combined  with it to make soup.    After supper, you find your tobacco is damp, and you cannot smoke.  Luckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates, if  taken in proper quantity, and this restores to you sufficient interest in  life to induce you to go to bed.    There you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest, and  that the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom of the  sea--the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom.  You wake up  and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened.  Your  first impression is that the end of the world has come; and then you  think that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#3)"],[1,"t, would also do well to remember it's nature and importance. They  are not thus honourably distinguished from the rest of their  fellow-subjects, merely that they may privilege their persons, their  estates, or their domestics; that they may list under party banners;  may grant or with-hold supplies; may vote with or vote against a  popular or unpopular administration; but upon considerations far more  interesting and important. They are the guardians of the English  constitution; the makers, repealers, and interpreters of the English  laws; delegated to watch, to check, and to avert every dangerous  innovation, to propose, to adopt, and to cherish any solid and  well-weighed improvement; bound by every tie of nature, of honour, and  of religion, to transmit that constitution and those laws to their  posterity, amended if possible, at least without any derogation. And  how unbecoming must it appear in a member of the legislature to vote  for a new law, who is utterly ignorant of the old! what kind of  interpretation can he be enabled to give, who is a stranger to the  text upon which he comments!    INDEED it is really amazing, that there should be no other state of  life, no other occupation, art, or science, in which some method of  instruction is not looked upon as requisite, except only the science  of legislation, the noblest and most difficult of any. Apprenticeships  are held necessary to almost every art, commercial or mechanical: a  long course of reading and study must form the divine, the physician,  and the practical professor of the laws: but every man of superior  fortune thinks himself _born_ a legislator. Yet Tully was of a  different opinion: \"It is necessary, says he[e], for a senator to be  thoroughly acquainted with the constitution; and this, he declares, is  a knowlege of the most extensive nature; a matter of science, of  diligence, of reflexion; without which no senator can possibly be fit  for his office.\"    [Footnote e: _De Legg._ 3. 18. _Est senatori necessarium nosse  rempublicam; idque late patet:--genus hoc omne scientiae, diligentiae,  memoriae est; sine quo paratus esse senator nullo pacto potest._]    THE mischiefs that have arisen to the public from inconsiderate  alterations in our laws, are too obvious to be called in question; and  how far they have been owing to the defective education of our  senators, is a point well worthy the public attention. The common law  of England has fared like other venerable edifices of antiquity, which  rash and unexperienced workmen have ventured to new-dress and refine,  with all the rage of modern improvement. Hence frequently it's  symmetry has been destroyed, it's proportions distorted, and it's  majestic simplicity exchanged for specious embellishments and  fantastic novelties. For, to say the truth, almost all the perplexed  questions, almost all the niceties, intricacies, and delays (which  have sometimes disgraced the English, as well as other, courts of  justice) owe their original not to the common law itself, but to  innovations that have been made in it by acts of parliament;  \"overladen (as sir Edward Coke expresses it[f]) with provisoes and  additions, and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of  none or very little judgment in law.\" This great and well-experienced  judge declares, that in all his time he never knew two questions made  upon rights merely depending upon the common law; and warmly laments  the confusion introduced by ill-judging and unlearned legislators.  \"But if, he subjoins, acts of parliament were after the old fashion  penned, by such only as perfectly knew what the common law was before  the making of any act of parliament concerning that matter, as also  how far forth former statutes had provided remedy for former  mischiefs, and defects discovered by experience; then should very few  questions in law arise, and the learned should not so often and so  much perplex their heads to make atonement and peace, by construction  of law, between insensible and disagreeing words, sentences, and  provisoes, as they now do.\" And if this inconvenience was so heavily  felt in the reign of queen Elizabeth, you may judge how the evil is  increased in later times, when the statute book is swelled to ten  times a larger bulk; unless it should be found, that the penners of  our modern statutes have proportionably better informed themselves in  the knowlege of the common law.    [Footnote f: 2 Rep. Pref.]    WHAT is said of our gentlemen in general, and the propriety of their  application to the study of the laws of their country, will hold  equally strong or still stronger with regard to the nobility of this  realm, except only in the article of serving upon juries. But, instead  of this, they have several peculiar provinces of far greater  consequence and concern; being not only by birth hereditary  counsellors of the crown, and judges upon their honour of the lives of  their brother-peers, but also arbiters of the property of all their  fellow-subjects, and that in the last resort. In this their judicial  capacity they are bound to decide the nicest and most critical points  of the law; to examine and correct such errors as have escaped the  most experienced sages of the profession, the lord keeper and the  judges of the courts at Westminster. Their sentence is final,  decisive, irrevocable: no appeal, no correction, not even a review can  be had: and to their determination, whatever it be, the inferior  courts of justice must conform; otherwise the rule of property would  no longer be uniform and steady.    SHOULD a judge in the most subordinate jurisdiction be deficient in  the knowlege of the law, it would reflect infinite contempt upon  himself and disgrace upon those who employ him. And yet the  consequence of his ignorance is comparatively very trifling and small:  his judgment may be examined, and his errors rectified, by other  courts. But how much more serious and affecting is the case of a  superior judge, if without any skill in the laws he will boldly  venture to decide a question, upon which the welfare and subsistence  of whole families may depend! where the chance of his judging right,  or wrong, is barely equal; and where, if he chances to judge wrong, he  does an injury of the most alarming nature, an injury without  possibility of redress!    YET, vast as this trust is, it can no where be so properly reposed as  in the noble hands where our excellent constitution has placed it: and  therefore placed it, because, from the independence of their fortune  and the dignity of their station, they are presumed to employ that  leisure which is the consequence of both, in attaining a more  extensive knowlege of the laws than persons of inferior rank: and  because the founders of our polity relied upon that delicacy of  sentiment, so peculiar to noble birth; which, as on the one hand it  will prevent either interest or affection from interfering in  questions of right, so on the other it will bind a peer in honour, an  obligation which the law esteems equal to another's oath, to be master  of those points upon which it is his birthright to decide.    THE Roman pandects will furnish us with a piece of history not  unapplicable to our present purpose. Servius Sulpicius, a gentleman of  the patrician order, and a celebrated orator, had occasion to take the  opinion of Quintus Mutius Scaevola, the oracle of the Roman law; but  for want of some knowlege in that science, could not so much as  understand even the technical terms, which his friend was obliged to  make use of. Upon which Mutius Scaevola could not forbear to upbraid  him with this memorable reproof[g], \"that it was a shame for a  patrician, a nobleman, and an orator of causes, to be ignorant of that  law in which he was so peculiarly concerned.\" This reproach made so  deep an impression on Sulpicius, that he immediately applied himself  to the study of the law; wherein he arrived to that proficiency, that  he left behind him about a hundred and fourscore volumes of his own  compiling upon the subject; and became, in the opinion of Cicero[h], a  much more complete lawyer than even Mutius Scaevola himself.    [Footnote g: _Ff._ 1. 2. 2. Sec. 43. _Turpe esse patricio, & nobili, &  causas oranti, jus in quo versaretur ignorare._]    [Footnote h: _Brut._ 41.]    I WOULD not be thought to recommend to our English nobility and gentry  to become as great lawyers as Sulpicius; though he, together with this  character, sustained likewise that of an excellent orator, a firm  patriot, and a wise indefatigable senator; but the inference which  arises from the story is this, that ignorance of the laws of the land  hath ever been esteemed dishonourable, in those who are entrusted by  their country to maintain, to administer, and to amend them.    BUT surely there is little occasion to enforce this argument any  farther to persons of rank and distinction, if we of this place may be  allowed to form a general judgment from those who are under our  inspection: happy, that while we lay down the rule, we can also  produce the example. You will therefore permit your professor to  indulge both a public and private satisfaction, by bearing this open  testimony; that in the infancy of these studies among us, they were  favoured with the most diligent attendance, and pursued with the most  unwearied application, by those of the noblest birth and most ample  patrimony: some of whom are still the ornaments of this seat of  learning; and others at a greater distance continue doing honour to  it's institutions, by comparing our polity and laws with those of  other kingdoms abroad, or exerting their senatorial abilities in the  councils of the nation at home.    NOR will some degree of legal knowlege be found in the least  superfluous to persons of inferior rank; especially those of the  learned professions.
