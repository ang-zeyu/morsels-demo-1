Schevill and E.M. Mitchell currently under review. The scientific names  are followed by the name of the individual who named the species and the  year of naming, and then by the common name most often used in the  western North Atlantic.[6] It may be noted that some of the authors are  in parentheses. This indicates that though the species name has remained  the same since the date of naming the species has since been assigned to  another genus. Because the species are not arranged in taxonomic order  in this field guide, the page of the synoptic account of each is  provided in the column to the right.    [Footnote 6: Most common names are based on some characteristic of the  species (e.g., spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin);  others are the names of authors of the species (e.g., True's beaked  whale) or of habitats or macrohabitats which they inhabit (e.g., North  Sea beaked whale and harbor porpoise); the origins of some common names,  however, are less obvious (e.g., dense-beaked whale), and of less use in  field references.]    [Illustration: Figure 1.--The western North Atlantic, from lat.  35 deg.N-65 deg.N.]    [Illustration: Figure 2.--The western North Atlantic, from lat. 37 deg.N  south to eastern Venezuela.]    [Illustration: Figure 3.--A baleen whale (humpback) showing the main  body parts referred to in the text.]    [Illustration: Figure 4.--A fin whale in the North Atlantic with the  paired blowholes open during respiration.

Watkins._)]      DOLPHIN OR PORPOISE    There is still considerable controversy over the correct usage of the  terms dolphin and porpoise. As mentioned in the preceding section,  common names of any species may vary from locale to locale and even from  individual to individual. Some persons argue for the use of the term  porpoise for all small cetaceans. Others insist on the term dolphin.  Still others either randomly use the terms or call members of the family  Delphinidae dolphins and members of the family Phocoenidae porpoises.  The evidence supporting any one of these positions is confusing at best  and no usage of terms appears to be without problems. We see no wholly  satisfactory resolution to the problem at this time. For all these  reasons, we have little desire to defend our decision to follow the last  of these practices in this guide, referring to all members of the family  Delphinidae for which the term dolphin or porpoise appears in the common  name as dolphins, and to the one member of the family Phocoenidae  represented in the western North Atlantic, _Phocoena phocoena_, as the  harbor porpoise. Although all cetaceans may be regarded as whales, the  term \"whale\" most commonly applies to the larger animals. For all  species treated, other common names by which they may be known are also  listed.    Detailed treatment of the relative merits of the various terminologies  is inappropriate here. Furthermore, it is our opinion that the usage of  the terms dolphin, porpoise, and whale as part of the common names of  cetaceans is largely a matter of personal preference.      ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDE    The differences between baleen and toothed whales are easy enough to see  in animals washed up on the beach or maintained in a tank at a zoo or  aquarium. But since an animal at sea can seldom be examined that  closely, its most obvious characteristics may be its overall size, the  presence or absence of a dorsal fin, its prominent coloration or  markings, its general behavior, or its swimming, blowing, and diving  characteristics. For that reason, regardless of their scientific  relationships, all the whales, dolphins, and the one porpoise covered in  the main text of this guide are divided into three groups. Those over 40  feet (12.2 m) long are discussed in the section on Large Whales, those  from 13 to 40 feet (4.0 to 12.2 m) in the Medium-Sized Whale, and those  less than 13 feet (4.0 m) in the Small Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoise  (with a dorsal fin). There are no small whales, dolphins, or porpoises  in this region without a dorsal fin. Each section is further divided  into those animals with a dorsal fin and those without. From that point,  animals likely to be confused in the field are grouped together and the  important differences between them are discussed.    The synoptic accounts of the species are followed by five appendices:  Appendix A discusses and illustrates man-made and applied tags and  natural markings on cetaceans and their importance in studies of natural  history. Appendix B discusses the data which are most important to  record in observations of cetaceans at sea, gives examples, and provides  blank sighting forms. Appendix C discusses possible causes of cetacean  strandings and the manner in which stranded animals should be handled  and adds a key and tables to aid in identifying stranded cetaceans.  Appendix D provides guidelines for collecting data on stranded cetaceans  and provides forms and specific instructions for taking standard  measurements. Appendix E lists institutions to be contacted in the event  of a cetacean stranding or for information.    A bibliography of useful references on cetaceans in general and  cetaceans of this region in particular and a directory to species  accounts are included.

All toothed whales have  teeth, which are used primarily for grasping rather than for chewing.  The number varies from 2 to over 250, though they are buried beneath the  gums in females and immature animals of several species, take peculiar  form in one (narwhal), and are extensively worn in others.

To use the guide to identify living animals observed at sea, a  person or persons should:      1. First estimate the animal's size and determine whether or not it has  a dorsal fin.    2. Note also any distinctive features of body shape and coloration and  observe its general behavior, including swimming, blowing, and diving  characteristics. It should be noted that coloration may vary somewhat at  sea, depending on light conditions and water clarity. For example,  animals which appear dark gray or black at the surface or when dead may  appear brown in good light or when submerged. Making a brief sketch at  this point may aid in identifying the animal or in later recalling its  distinctive features.    3. Using the directory, locate the section to which the animal probably  belongs.    4.

The  eastern part of the basin is the valley of the Rio Balsas. From the  point of junction of the two rivers, the Rio Balsas flows southward  through a narrow gorge, which separates the Sierra de Coalcoman from  the Sierra del Sur, to the Pacific Ocean. In Michoacan the floor of the  Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin varies from 200 to 700 meters above sea level.    The central part of Mexico is a vast table-land, the Mexican Plateau,  the southern part of which extends into northern Michoacan. In this  region the terrain is rolling and varies from 1500 to 1900 meters above  sea level. Many small mountain ranges rise from the plateau and break  the continuity of the rolling table-land. Located on the southern part  of the Mexican Plateau in Michoacan are several lakes, the largest of  which are Lago de Chapala, Lago de Cuitzeo, and Lago de Patzcuaro.    Bordering the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau is a nearly unbroken  chain of volcanos, the Cordillera Volcanica. The highest peaks in  Michoacan, Cerro San Andres (3930 meters) and Cerro de Tancitaro (3870  meters), are in this range. Parts of the Cordillera Volcanica in  Michoacan are known by separate names; these are, from west to east:  Sierra de los Tarascos, Sierra de Ozumatlan, and Serrania de Ucareo.    Lying between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and east of  the Rio Coahuayana and west of the Rio Balsas, is an isolated highland  mass, the Sierra de Coalcoman. This mountain range rises to elevations  of slightly more than 3000 meters. It has a length of about 200  kilometers and a width of about 80 kilometers. Except for a relatively  low connection with the Cordillera Volcanica, the Sierra de Coalcoman is  isolated from other mountain ranges in southwestern Mexico.      CLIMATE    The climates in Michoacan vary from tropical in the lowlands to cool  temperate at high elevations in the Sierra de Coalcoman and Cordillera  Volcanica. The highest temperatures are known in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec  Basin, where at Churumuco the mean annual temperature is 29.3 deg. C. and  the range of monthly means is 3.5 deg. C. (Contreras, 1942). Frosts occur  sporadically on the Mexican Plateau, and in the winter snow falls on the  highest mountains.    Precipitation varies geographically and seasonally. Most of the rain  falls between June and October. In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin  rainfall in the rest of the year is negligible. The annual average  rainfall at Coahuayana on the Pacific Coastal Plain is 871 mm.  (Guzman-Rivas, 1957:52). In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin rainfall  seldom exceeds 800 mm. per year. In the mountains precipitation is  heavier and somewhat more evenly distributed throughout the year, but  still definitely cyclic. For example, Uruapan (elevation, 1500 meters)  receives an average annual rainfall of 1674 mm. (Contreras, 1942). The  prevailing winds are from the Pacific Ocean. The southern (windward)  slopes of the Sierra de Coalcoman probably receive more rain than any  other part of the state. The Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin lies in a rain  shadow of the Sierra de Coalcoman, and the Mexican Plateau lies in a  somewhat less drastic rain shadow of the Cordillera Volcanica; these are  the driest regions in the state.      VEGETATION AND ANIMAL HABITATS    For the purposes of this report I have adopted the classification of  types of vegetation that seem to me most significant in terms of  ecological distribution of reptiles and amphibians in Michoacan. These  types are as follows:        TEMPERATE (1000-4000 meters)        Fir Forest (2400-4000 meters)        Pine-oak Forest (1000-4000 meters)        Mesquite-grassland (1500-2100 meters)        TROPICAL (0-1000 meters)        Arid Tropical Scrub Forest (0-1000 meters)        Tropical Semi-deciduous Forest (150-600 meters)    The vegetation of the Pacific Coastal Plain and the Balsas-Tepalcatepec  Basin consists of arid tropical scrub forest, composed of deciduous  trees, which in many places are stunted and widely spaced. In the dry  season there is little cover provided by this forest. In the rainy  season there is a sparse growth of grasses and some shade provided by  the small leaves of the thorny trees.    In Michoacan the rainfall is heaviest on the southern slopes of the  Sierra de Coalcoman and somewhat less so on the southwestern slopes of  the Cordillera Volcanica. At these relatively low elevations (150 to 600  meters) there is tropical semi-deciduous forest, characterized by  relatively dense shade throughout the year and by a leaf mulch on the  ground. This type of forest forms the gallery forest along the larger  streams in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin and on the Pacific Coastal  Plain.    Rainfall also is heavy on the high mountain ridges, where temperatures  are low. On these ridges, fir forest, often mixed with pine and oaks, is  found. This habitat is characterized by a cool, moist climate, many  rotting logs, and a moist ground cover of leaves and needles.    Most of the mountains are covered with pine-oak forest, which in most  places is decidedly subhumid, but where this forest occurs on the  windward sides of high ridges, it sometimes is noticeably humid. In  this forest the important animal habitats include the needle- and  leaf-litter, and in some areas, bromeliads.    The rolling terrain of the Mexican Plateau supports cacti, small  leguminous trees, and grasses. Like the arid tropical scrub forest, this  type of vegetation, the Mesquite-grassland association, is deciduous and  thus provides little shelter in the dry season. Unlike the areas in  which arid tropical scrub forest is developed, the Mesquite-grassland is  found in areas having warm days and cool nights.          GEOGRAPHY OF THE HERPETOFAUNA      Although the main part of my final report on the herpetofauna of  Michoacan will deal with the geographical and ecological patterns of  distribution of the herpetofauna, a brief summary of the faunal  assemblages is presented here.    In Michoacan there are two major faunal assemblages, one in the  lowlands, and one in the highlands. A large number of the species  inhabiting the lowlands are wide-ranging species, such as _Bufo  marinus_, _Iguana iguana_, and _Boa constrictor_. Sixty-three species  are known to occur on the Pacific Coastal Plain; 41 of these, together  with 36 others occur in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, a physiographic  region to which several species of reptiles are endemic; for example,  _Enyaliosaurus clarki_, _Urosaurus gadowi_, _Cnemidophorus calidipes_,  and _Eumeces altamirani_.    Generally speaking, the members of the highland faunal assemblage have  more restricted geographic ranges. The major exceptions are those  species that are widely distributed on the Mexican Plateau, such as:  _Bufo compactilis_, _Sceloporus torquatus_, and _Salvadora bairdi_. In  the montane habitats of the Cordillera Volcanica, 45 species of  amphibians and reptiles are known; 34 species have been found in the  Sierra de Coalcoman. Fourteen species are known to occur in both ranges.  Several species are known only from the Cordillera Volcanica and  adjacent highlands, and three species are endemic to the Sierra de  Coalcoman.          ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES      In the following pages the 176 species and subspecies of amphibians and  reptiles known to occur in the state of Michoacan are discussed in  relation to their variation, life histories, ecology, and distribution  in the state. Data have been gathered from 9676 specimens. I have not  prolonged the accounts of species with information that has been  presented elsewhere. Consequently, the length and completeness of the  accounts are variable. I have given only the information that I consider  a worthwhile contribution to our knowledge of the particular species.    The synonymies given at the beginning of each account include the first  use of the trivial name by the original author, the first usage of the  combination that I am using, and, if the circumstances make it  necessary, additional names or combinations that have been proposed  since the publication of the checklists of Mexican amphibians and  reptiles by Smith and Taylor (1945, 1948, and 1950b). References cited  only in the synonymies are not listed in the Literature Cited. Preceding  the discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of the localities  in Michoacan from which specimens have been examined. The listing of a  locality means that one or more specimens, as indicated, has been  examined from that locality. Only for those specimens especially  mentioned in the text are catalogue numbers given.
