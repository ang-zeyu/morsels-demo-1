I think of a fringe of box-elders  along Paxton Creek, decked in early spring with true maple flowers on  thread-like stems, each cluster surmounted by soft green foliage  apparently borrowed from the ash, and it seems that no other tree could  fit better into the place or the season. Then I remember another, a  single stately tree that has had a great field all to itself, and stands  up in superb dignity, dominating even the group of pin-oaks nearest to  it. 'Twas the surprising mist of bloom on this tree that took me up the  field on a run, one spring day, when the running was sweet in the air,  but sticky underfoot. The color effect of the flowers is most delicate,  and almost indescribable in ordinary chromatic terms. Don't miss the  acquaintance of the ash-leaved maple at its flowering time, in the very  flush of the springtime, my tree-loving friends!    I have not found a noticeable fragrance in the flowers of the box-elder,  such as is very apparent where there is a group of Norway maples in  bloom together. The red maples also give to the air a faint and  delightfully spicy odor, under favorable conditions. May I hint that the  lusty box-elder, when it is booming along its spring growth, furnishes  a loose-barked whistle stick about as good as those that come from the  willow? The generous growth that provides its loosening sap can also  spare a few twigs for the boys, and they will be all the better for a  melodious reason for the spring ramble.    [Illustration: The ash-leaved maples in bloom]    The striped maple of Pennsylvania, a comparatively rare and entirely  curious small tree or large shrub, is not well known, though growing  freely as \"elkwood\" and \"moosewood\" in the Alleghanies, because it is  rather hard to transplant, and thus offers no inducements to the  nurserymen. These good people, like the rest of us, move along the lines  of least resistance, wherefore many a fine tree or fruit is rare to us,  because shy or difficult of growth, or perhaps unsymmetrical. The fine  Rhode Island Greening apple is unpopular because the young tree is  crooked, while the leather-skinned and punk-fleshed Ben Davis is a model  of symmetry and rapidity of growth. Our glorious tulip tree of the  woods, because of its relative difficulty in transplanting, has had to  be insisted upon from the nurserymen by those who know its superb  beauty. For the same reason this small charming maple, with the large,  soft, comfortable leaves upon which the deer love to browse, is kept  from showing its delicate June bloom and its remarkable longitudinally  striped bark in our home grounds. I hope some maple friends will look  for it, and, finding, admire this, the aristocrat among our native  species.    [Illustration: Striped maple]    The mountain maple--the nurserymen call it _Acer spicatum_--is another  native of rather dwarf growth. It is bushy, and not remarkable in leaf,  its claim for distinction being in its flowers and samaras, which are  held saucily up, above the branches on which they grow, rather than  drooping modestly, as other maples gracefully bear their bloom and  fruit. These shiny seeds or keys are brightly scarlet, as well, and thus  very attractive in color. There is a reason for this, in nature's  economy; for while the loosely hung samaras of the other maples are  distributed by the breezes, the red pods of this mountain maple hold  stiffly upward to attract the birds upon whom it largely depends for  that sowing which must precede its reproduction.    Of the other maples of America--a score of them there are--I might write  pages, to weariness. The black maple of the Eastern woods, the  large-leaved maples of the West, these and many more are in this great  family, to say nothing of the many interesting cultivated forms and  variations introduced from European nurseries, and most serviceable in  formal ornamental planting. But I have told of those I know best and  those that any reader can know as well in one season, if he looks for  them with the necessary tree love which is but a fine form of true love  of God's creation. This love, once implanted, means surer protection for  the trees, otherwise so defenseless against the unthinking vandalism of  commercialism or incompetence--a vandalism that has not only devastated  our American forests, but mutilated shamefully many trees of priceless  value in and about our cities.    Of the Japanese maples--their leaves seemingly a showing of the  ingenuity of these Yankees of the Orient, in their twists of form and  depths of odd color--I could tell a tale, but it would be of the tree  nursery and not of the broad outdoors. Let us close the book and go  afield, in park or meadow, on street or lawn, and look to the maples for  an unsuspected feast of bloom, if it be spring, or for richness of  foliage in summer and autumn; and in coldest winter let us notice the  delicate twigs and yet sturdy structure of this tree family that is most  of all characteristic of the home, in city or country.          The Growth of the Oak      The old saw has it, \"Great oaks from little acorns grow,\" and all of us  who remember the saying have thus some idea of what the beginning of an  oak is. But what of the beginning of the acorn? In a general way, one  inferentially supposes that there must be a flower somewhere in the  life-history of the towering white oak that has defied the storms of  centuries and seems a type of everything sturdy and strong and  masculine; but what sort of a flower could one imagine as the source of  so much majesty? We know of the great magnolias, with blooms befitting  the richness of the foliage that follows them. We see, and some of us  admire, the exquisitely delicate blossoms of that splendid American  tree, the tulip or whitewood. We inhale with delight the fragrance that  makes notable the time when the common locust sends forth its white  racemes of loveliness. But we miss, many of us, the flowering of the  oaks in early spring, and we do not realize that this family of trees,  most notable for rugged strength, has its bloom of beginning at the  other end of the scale, in flowers of delicate coloring and rather  diminutive size.    The reason I missed appreciating the flowers of the oak--they are quite  new to me--for some years of tree admiration was because of the  distracting accompaniment the tree gives to the blooms. Some trees--most  of the maples, for instance--send out their flowers boldly ahead of the  foliage, and it is thus easy to see what is happening above your head,  as you stroll along drinking in the spring's nectar of spicy air.  Others, again, have such showy blooms that the mass of foliage only  accentuates their attractiveness, and it is not possible to miss them.    [Illustration: The swamp white oak in winter]    But the oak is different; it is, as modest as it is strong, and its  bloom is nearly surrounded by the opening leaves in most seasons and in  most of the species I am just beginning to be acquainted with. Then,  too, these opening leaves are of such indescribable colors--if the  delicate chromatic tints they reflect to the eye may be so strongly  named--that they harmonize, and do not contrast, with the flowers. It is  with them almost as with a fearless chipmunk whose acquaintance I  cultivated one summer--he was gay with stripes of soft color, yet he so  fitted any surroundings he chose to be in that when he was quiet he  simply disappeared! The oak's flowers and its exquisite unfolding of  young foliage combine in one effect, and it is an effect so beautiful  that one easily fails to separate its parts, or to see which of the mass  of soft pink, gray, yellow and green is bloom and which of it is  leafage.    [Illustration: Flowers of the pin-oak]    Take the pin-oak, for instance, and note the softness of the greenery  above its flowers. Hardly can we define the young leaves as green--they  are all tints, and all beautiful. This same pin-oak, by the way (I mean  the one the botanists call _Quercus palustris_), is a notable  contradiction of the accepted theory that an oak of size and dignity  cannot be reared in a lifetime. There are hundreds of lusty pin-oaks all  over the Eastern States that are shading the homes of the wise men who  planted them in youth, and they might well adorn our parks and avenues  in place of many far less beautiful and permanent trees. With ordinary  care, and in good soil, the pin-oak grows rapidly, and the  characteristic spreading habit and the slightly down-drooping branches  are always attractive. In its age it has not the ruggedness of its kin,  though it assumes a stately and somewhat formal habit, and, I must  confess, accumulates some ragged dead branches in its interior.    This raggedness is easily cared for, for the tree requires--and few  trees do--no \"trimming\" of its outer branches. The interior twigs that  the rapid growth of the tree has deprived of air and light can be  quickly and easily removed. In Washington, where street-tree planting  has been and is intelligently managed under central authority, the  avenues of pin-oaks are a splendid feature of the great boulevards which  are serving already as a model to the whole country. Let us plant oaks,  and relieve the monotony of too many maples, poplars and horse-chestnuts  along our city and village highways.    I like, too, to see the smooth little acorns of the pin-oak before the  leaves drop; they seem so finished and altogether pleasing, and with the  leaves make a classical decorative motive worth more attention from  designers.    While I am innocent of either ability or intent to write botanically of  the great oak family, I ought perhaps to transcribe the information that  the flowers we see--if we look just at the right time in the  spring-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28767"],[0,"The Defenders (#3)"],[1,"light, eating synthetics--    \"You shouldn't be so bitter,\" he said.    Mary smiled a little. \"I'm bitter because I know you'll never come  back.\" She turned away. \"I'll never see you again, once you go up  there.\"    He was shocked. \"What? How can you say a thing like that?\"    She did not answer.           *       *       *       *       *    He awakened with the public newscaster screeching in his ears, shouting  outside the building.    \"Special news bulletin! Surface forces report enormous Soviet attack  with new weapons! Retreat of key groups! All work units report to  factories at once!\"    Taylor blinked, rubbing his eyes. He jumped out of bed and hurried to  the vidphone. A moment later he was put through to Moss.    \"Listen,\" he said. \"What about this new attack? Is the project off?\" He  could see Moss's desk, covered with reports and papers.    \"No,\" Moss said. \"We're going right ahead. Get over here at once.\"    \"But--\"    \"Don't argue with me.\" Moss held up a handful of surface bulletins,  crumpling them savagely. \"This is a fake. Come on!\" He broke off.    Taylor dressed furiously, his mind in a daze.    Half an hour later, he leaped from a fast car and hurried up the stairs  into the Synthetics Building. The corridors were full of men and women  rushing in every direction. He entered Moss's office.    \"There you are,\" Moss said, getting up immediately. \"Franks is waiting  for us at the outgoing station.\"    They went in a Security Car, the siren screaming. Workers scattered out  of their way.    \"What about the attack?\" Taylor asked.    Moss braced his shoulders. \"We're certain that we've forced their hand.  We've brought the issue to a head.\"    They pulled up at the station link of the Tube and leaped out. A moment  later they were moving up at high speed toward the first stage.    They emerged into a bewildering scene of activity. Soldiers were  fastening on lead suits, talking excitedly to each other, shouting back  and forth. Guns were being given out, instructions passed.    Taylor studied one of the soldiers. He was armed with the dreaded Bender  pistol, the new snub-nosed hand weapon that was just beginning to come  from the assembly line. Some of the soldiers looked a little frightened.    \"I hope we're not making a mistake,\" Moss said, noticing his gaze.    Franks came toward them. \"Here's the program. The three of us are going  up first, alone. The soldiers will follow in fifteen minutes.\"    \"What are we going to tell the leadys?\" Taylor worriedly asked. \"We'll  have to tell them something.\"    \"We want to observe the new Soviet attack.\" Franks smiled ironically.  \"Since it seems to be so serious, we should be there in person to  witness it.\"    \"And then what?\" Taylor said.    \"That'll be up to them. Let's go.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In a small car, they went swiftly up the Tube, carried by anti-grav  beams from below. Taylor glanced down from time to time. It was a long  way back, and getting longer each moment. He sweated nervously inside  his suit, gripping his Bender pistol with inexpert fingers.    Why had they chosen him? Chance, pure chance. Moss had asked him to come  along as a Department member. Then Franks had picked him out on the spur  of the moment. And now they were rushing toward the surface, faster and  faster.    A deep fear, instilled in him for eight years, throbbed in his mind.  Radiation, certain death, a world blasted and lethal--    Up and up the car went. Taylor gripped the sides and closed his eyes.  Each moment they were closer, the first living creatures to go above the  first stage, up the Tube past the lead and rock, up to the surface. The  phobic horror shook him in waves. It was death; they all knew that.  Hadn't they seen it in the films a thousand times? The cities, the sleet  coming down, the rolling clouds--    \"It won't be much longer,\" Franks said. \"We're almost there. The surface  tower is not expecting us. I gave orders that no signal was to be sent.\"    The car shot up, rushing furiously. Taylor's head spun; he hung on, his  eyes shut. Up and up....    The car stopped. He opened his eyes.    They were in a vast room, fluorescent-lit, a cavern filled with  equipment and machinery, endless mounds of material piled in row after  row. Among the stacks, leadys were working silently, pushing trucks and  handcarts.    \"Leadys,\" Moss said. His face was pale. \"Then we're really on the  surface.\"    The leadys were going back and forth with equipment moving the vast  stores of guns and spare parts, ammunition and supplies that had been  brought to the surface. And this was the receiving station for only one  Tube; there were many others, scattered throughout the continent.    Taylor looked nervously around him. They were really there, above  ground, on the surface. This was where the war was.    \"Come on,\" Franks said. \"A B-class guard is coming our way.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They stepped out of the car. A leady was approaching them rapidly. It  coasted up in front of them and stopped, scanning them with its  hand-weapon raised.    \"This is Security,\" Franks said. \"Have an A-class sent to me at once.\"    The leady hesitated. Other B-class guards were coming, scooting across  the floor, alert and alarmed. Moss peered around.    \"Obey!\" Franks said in a loud, commanding voice. \"You've been ordered!\"    The leady moved uncertainly away from them. At the end of the building,  a door slid back. Two A-class leadys appeared, coming slowly toward  them. Each had a green stripe across its front.    \"From the Surface Council,\" Franks whispered tensely. \"This is above  ground, all right. Get set.\"    The two leadys approached warily. Without speaking, they stopped close  by the men, looking them up and down.    \"I'm Franks of Security. We came from undersurface in order to--\"    \"This in incredible,\" one of the leadys interrupted him coldly. \"You  know you can't live up here. The whole surface is lethal to you. You  can't possibly remain on the surface.\"    \"These suits will protect us,\" Franks said. \"In any case, it's not your  responsibility. What I want is an immediate Council meeting so I can  acquaint myself with conditions, with the situation here. Can that be  arranged?\"    \"You human beings can't survive up here. And the new Soviet attack is  directed at this area. It is in considerable danger.\"    \"We know that. Please assemble the Council.\" Franks looked around him at  the vast room, lit by recessed lamps in the ceiling. An uncertain  quality came into his voice. \"Is it night or day right now?\"    \"Night,\" one of the A-class leadys said, after a pause. \"Dawn is coming  in about two hours.\"    Franks nodded. \"We'll remain at least two hours, then. As a concession  to our sentimentality, would you please show us some place where we can  observe the Sun as it comes up? We would appreciate it.\"    A stir went through the leadys.    \"It is an unpleasant sight,\" one of the leadys said. \"You've seen the  photographs; you know what you'll witness. Clouds of drifting particles  blot out the light, slag heaps are everywhere, the whole land is  destroyed. For you it will be a staggering sight, much worse than  pictures and film can convey.\"    \"However it may be, we'll stay long enough to see it. Will you give the  order to the Council?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Come this way.\" Reluctantly, the two leadys coasted toward the wall of  the warehouse. The three men trudged after them, their heavy shoes  ringing against the concrete. At the wall, the two leadys paused.    \"This is the entrance to the Council Chamber. There are windows in the  Chamber Room, but it is still dark outside, of course. You'll see  nothing right now, but in two hours--\"    \"Open the door,\" Franks said.    The door slid back. They went slowly inside. The room was small, a neat  room with a round table in the center, chairs ringing it. The three of  them sat down silently, and the two leadys followed after them, taking  their places.    \"The other Council Members are on their way. They have already been  notified and are coming as quickly as they can. Again I urge you to go  back down.\" The leady surveyed the three human beings. \"There is no way  you can meet the conditions up here. Even we survive with some trouble,  ourselves. How can you expect to do it?\"    The leader approached Franks.    \"This astonishes and perplexes us,\" it said. \"Of course we must do what  you tell us, but allow me to point out that if you remain here--\"    \"We know,\" Franks said impatiently. \"However, we intend to remain, at  least until sunrise.\"    \"If you insist.\"    There was silence. The leadys seemed to be conferring with each other,  although the three men heard no sound.    \"For your own good,\" the leader said at last, \"you must go back down. We  have discussed this, and it seems to us that you are doing the wrong  thing for your own good.\"    \"We are human beings,\" Franks said sharply. \"Don't you understand? We're  men, not machines.\"    \"That is precisely why you must go back. This room is radioactive; all  surface areas are. We calculate that your suits will not protect you for  over fifty more minutes. Therefore--\"    The leadys moved abruptly toward the men, wheeling in a circle, forming  a solid row. The men stood up, Taylor reaching awkwardly for his weapon,  his fingers numb and stupid. The men stood facing the silent metal  figures.    \"We must insist,\" the leader said, its voice without emotion. \"We must  take you back to the Tube and send you down on the next car. I am sorry,  but it is necessary.\"    \"What'll we do?\" Moss said nervously to Franks. He touched his gun.  \"Shall we blast them?\"    Franks shook his head. \"All right,\" he said to the leader. \"We'll go  back.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He moved toward the door, motioning Taylor and Moss to follow him. They  looked at him in surprise, but "]]]
