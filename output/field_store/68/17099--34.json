A British Commission has reported to Parliament that it takes three  times as much fodder to produce beef as it does to produce milk or pork  of the same food value. Since cows eat chiefly hay and grass and pigs  eat grain the cost of the production of a unit value of milk is much  less than the cost of the same value in the form of pork. It takes only  fifty per cent. more fodder to produce veal than to produce pork. Milk,  pork, and veal have long been the established protein-containing foods  of nations on the continent of Europe. According to these figures beef  should cost in the market twice what veal costs, and yet the butcher  charges nearly the same for the two. It would save food for milk  production if steers were eaten as veal and not fed up into beef cattle.  A suitable tax on all steers over a year old would accomplish this  result. If all heifers were developed into milch cows and no cow capable  of giving milk in quantity were slaughtered, the country would be placed  on a much better basis than at present. It might make beef expensive,  but there is every reason why it should be expensive. It would increase  the dairy business, which is evidently a need of the times, something  for the protection of the welfare of mankind. For it must be remembered  that a well-nourished cow during a single year will give in the form of  milk as much protein and two and a half times the number of calories as  are contained in her own body.    This was written before the publication of the following words of  Armsby, the foremost authority on animal nutrition:[2]       Roast pig, to those who like it, is not only a delicacy but a     valuable article of diet, but nevertheless, it is possible to     pay too high a price for it, and while a proposal to restrict     rather than to promote meat production in the present crisis     may appear both irrational and unpatriotic it may nevertheless     be in the interest of true food economy....       It may be roughly estimated that about 24 per cent. of the     energy of grain is recovered for human consumption in pork,     about 18 per cent. in milk and only about 3.5 per cent. in     beef and mutton. In other words, the farmer who feeds bread     grains to his stock is burning up 75 to 97 per cent. of them     in order to produce for us a small residue of roast pig, and     so is diminishing the total stock of human food....       The task of the stock feeder must be to utilize through his     skill and knowledge the inedible products of the farm and     factory, such as hay, corn stalks, straw, bran, brewers' and     distillers' grains, gluten feed, and the like, and to make at     least a fraction of them available for man's use. In so doing     he will be really adding to the food supply and will be     rendering a great public service. Rather than seek to     stimulate live stock husbandry the ideal should be to adjust     it to the limits set by the available supply of forage crops     and by-product feeding stuffs while, on the other hand,     utilizing these to the greatest practicable extent, because in     this way we save some of what would otherwise be a total     loss....       The hog is the great competitor of man for the higher grades     of food, and in swine husbandry as ordinarily conducted we are     in danger of paying too much for our roast pig. Cattle and     sheep, on the other hand, although less efficient as     converters, can utilize products which man can not use and     save some of their potential value as human food. From this     point of view, as well as on account of the importance of milk     to infants and invalids, the high economy of food production     by the dairy cow deserves careful consideration, although of     course the large labor requirement is a counterbalancing     factor.       At any rate, it is clear that at the present time enthusiastic     but ill-considered \"booming\" of live stock production may do     more harm than good. If it is desirable to restrict or     prohibit the production of alcohol from grain or potatoes on     the ground that it involves a waste of food value, the same     reason calls for restriction of the burning-up of these     materials to produce roast pig. This means, of course, a     limited meat supply. To some of us this may seem a hardship.     Meat, however, is by no means the essential that we have been     wont to suppose and partial deprivation of it is not     inconsistent with high bodily efficiency. Certainly no     patriotic citizen would wish to insist on his customary     allowance of roast pig at the cost of the food supply of his     brothers in the trenches.    [2] \"Roast Pig,\" _Science_, 1917, xlvi, 160.    The United States Department of Agriculture has estimated that a pig  that has reached the weight of 150 pounds should be slaughtered, because  beyond that weight the cost of the quantity of feed required to maintain  the animal is out of proportion to the gain in food value of the pig.  One might, therefore, call a pig weighing 150 pounds a _maximal economic  hog_.          II    CALORIES IN COMMON LIFE      A person is properly nourished who receives adequate energy in the form  of carbohydrate and fat (and incidentally protein); adequate material  for repair of wornout parts, such as protein and mineral salts; and the  diet must contain certain accessory food substances known as food  hormones or \"vitamins.\" Also, it must contain water. But this is not  all, for the food offered must be acceptable to the palate of the  individual. A member of the French Scientific Commission which visited  the United States in the summer of 1917, when questioned regarding the  use of corn bread in France, replied \"on ne peut pas changer des  habitudes.\" The proper nutrition of an individual depends, therefore,  not only upon a sufficient supply of food from a mechanistic standpoint,  but also upon the reasonable satisfaction of the sense of appetite.  These dual fundamentals of proper nutrition should be ever borne in  mind.    Heat from the sun enters into the composition of the food substances  when they are being built up in the plants, and this energy, which is  latent in the food, is set free in the animal body and is used as the  source of power behind all the physical activities of the body. The  energy can all be recovered as heat and measured in the form of  calories. According to the principles of the law of the conservation of  energy, heat is not destructible. The understanding of the value of a  calorie is indispensable for the comprehension of nutrition. A calorie  is the measure of a unit of heat, or the quantity of heat necessary to  raise a liter of water from 0 deg. to 1 deg. Centigrade. Apparatus has  been invented for measuring the heat production of a man, an apparatus  which is called a calorimeter or a measurer of calories. If one puts a  man weighing, say, 156 pounds in the box of such an apparatus, so that  he lies comfortably on a bed in complete muscular relaxation, and before  his breakfast, one finds that he produces 70 calories an hour. Only in  certain types of disease is there any variation from this normal, though  of course the weight of the man makes a difference in his requirement  for energy. If, at the same time the subject is in the box, the quantity  of oxygen which he absorbs is measured and if certain other chemical  analyses be carried out, one can calculate the exact amounts of protein,  fat, and sugar which have been oxidized by this oxygen. Now, if one  calculates how much heat ought to have been set free from the oxidation  of these quantities of protein fat and carbohydrate, it is discovered  that the heat which ought to have been produced is exactly that quantity  which was measured as having been produced by the man. This measurement  represents the _basal metabolism_ of a man at complete rest, when his  oxidative activities are at their lowest ebb.    The basal metabolism as measured by 70 calories per hour in the case of  this individual represents the sum of the fuel needed--(1) to maintain  the beating of the heart, which every minute of a man's life moves the  blood or one-twentieth part of the weight of the body, in a circle  through the blood-vessels; (2) to maintain the muscles of respiration  that the blood may be purified in the lungs; (3) to maintain the body  temperature at that constant level which is so characteristic that a  slight variation signifies illness, and (4) to maintain in the living  state the numerous tissues of the body. Any extraneous muscular  movements are carried out in virtue of an increased oxidation of  materials and the heat production rises above the level of the basal  metabolism with increased muscular effort. For a long time the power for  the maintenance of the human machine can be furnished by its own body  fat, as is seen in cases of prolonged fasting, but usually the power is  derived instead from the food-fuel which is taken. The great question in  the world to-day is whether or not a sufficient quantity of food-fuel is  available to support the human family. The question of calories is not  an academic one, but an intensely practical one.    Science strives to express itself in mathematic terms, and this paper is  written with that end in view.    Phenomena of life are phenomena of motion. These motions are maintained  at the expense of chemical energy liberated in the oxidative breakdown  of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Furthermore, the protein structure of  the body cells and the salts of the bones and other tissues are in a  constant state of wearing down. The energy for the human machine and the  materials for its self-repair are taken in the form of food. The general  term _metabolism_ includes all the chemical activities which take place  under the influence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32505"],[0,"The Systematics of the Frogs of the Hyla Rubra Group in Middle America (#3)"],[1,"    |           |         |  Venezuela: Santome  |  4 | 35.5-40.9 | 0.45-0.48 |0.63-0.67| 0.36-0.40                      |    |   (38.5)  |  (0.46)   | (0.65)  |  (0.38)      TABLE 2.--Comparison of Mating Calls in the _Hyla rubra_ Group.

The alary processes of the  premaxillaries are widely separated, concave posteriorly, and vertical.  Ventrally, the premaxillary is connected to the prevomer by bony  tissues. The maxillary is slender and bears 70 to 91 teeth (mean for 6  specimens 78.1). The pars facialis of the maxillary is laterally convex  and about four times as high as the pars dentalis.    The nasal is large (its length about 40 per cent of total length of  skull), and pointed anteriorly and posteriorly in dorsal view. The  nasals are separated anteromedially by the cartilaginous septum nasi.  One or two protuberances are present on the midlateral concavity of the  nasal. Posteriorly, the nasal overlaps the sphenethmoid and articulates  with the palatine. Dorsally the sphenethmoid is large, pentagonal, and  completely ossified. The frontoparietal is elongate, smooth, and bears  a small supraorbital process on the anterior edge of the orbit. A  keyhole-shaped frontoparietal fontanelle is present; the fontanelle is  narrow anteriorly and wide posteriorly.    The bony part of the prooetic is separated dorsally from the squamosal  by the cartilaginous crista parotica. The squamosal is small, its  anterior arm slender and pointed. The posterior arm of the squamosal is  pointed terminally and articulates with the prooetic medially.    The prevomer is large and elongate. Anteriorly the prevomer is  connected to the maxillary-premaxillary articulation; posteriorly, the  prevomer is separated from the sphenethmoid by cartilage. Each prevomer  bears six to nine teeth. The palatine is present and edentate. The  anterior end of the parasphenoid is broad (less pointed than in _Hyla  foliamorta_). The pterygoid is slender and well developed.    _Natural History._--_Hyla boulengeri_ inhabits humid lowland tropical  forests and breeds in temporary ponds. Clasping pairs and gravid  females were observed at Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, on  June 21, 1966. Males were calling from depressions in decaying logs and  stumps, in forked stems, and from leaves of broad-leafed plants near  the pond. Males were observed in late July and early August calling  from _Calathea_ and _Heliconia_ leaves at the edge of a pond in the wet  forest of the Osa Peninsula. William E. Duellman informed me that he  collected calling males in January at El Real, Darien, and in March at  Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama. Taylor (1952) found calling males in  June at Turrialba, Cartago Province, Costa Rica, and Dunn (1931a)  observed males calling in July, November, and December in Panama.  Gravid females have been found from April to August. Breeding  activities of _Hyla boulengeri_ always seem to be associated with  temporary ponds; in Central America breeding apparently takes place  throughout most of the year.    The mating call of _Hyla boulengeri_ consists of one short, moderately  low-pitched note. Each note has a duration of 0.24 to 0.47 second and  is repeated at intervals of one second to several minutes. The notes  have 80 to 120 pulses per second, a fundamental frequency of about 70  cycles per second, and a dominant frequency of 2,840 cycles per second  (Table 2, Pl. 3A).    The eggs are deposited in a mass in the water. No information is  available concerning early development. Tadpoles in advanced stages of  development were found in a temporary pond at Rincon de Osa, Puntarenas  Province, Costa Rica. The pond was about 10 cm. deep, had a muddy  bottom and lacked vegetation. Three recently metamorphosed young were  found in mid-August, 1966, on grass at the edge of another temporary  pond in the forest.    _Tadpoles_--Twelve tadpoles are available. These were collected at  Rincon de Osa, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. The maximum size  represented is 34.0 mm., total length (stage 42 of development).    A typical tadpole in stage 36 of development (KU 104295) has a body  length of 12.0 mm., tail length of 20.0 mm., and total length of 32.0  mm. Other characters are as follows: depth of tail equal to length of  body; body deeper than wide; distance between eye and nostril equal to  that between nostril and tip of snout; mouth anteroventral, upper and  lower lips bare; papillae present laterally; tooth rows 2/3; upper rows  about equal in length; first upper row slightly, and second upper row  widely, interrupted medially; lower rows about equal in length, shorter  than upper rows; third lower row containing 5-10 large teeth; beak  strong, serrate; spiracle nearer anus than eye; anal aperture not  extending to border of ventral fin; caudal musculature slender  posteriorly, extending to tip of pointed tail; dorsal fin extending to  middle of body, slightly deeper than ventral fin; posterior three  fourths of tail spotted; rest of tail and body gray-brown or  transparent; hindlimbs flecked or spotted with brown (Table 3, Fig. 2A  and 3A).

The venter is  immaculate; the dorsum and limbs are gray-brown in preservative (pale  green in life). The interorbital space, supratympanic fold, and  scapular region are darker than the rest of the body; the fingers lack  webbing; the webbing on the foot is the same as in adults; small  metatarsal tubercles are present, but the tarsal fold is absent.

Guenther (1901:267) placed _boulengeri_ in the genus _Hyla_,  and stated that Cope possibly placed _boulengeri_ in the genus  _Scytopis_ on the supposition that it had an accumulation of  \"sebaceous glands\" above the tympanum. Noble (1918:339) redescribed  _Hyla boulengeri_ on the basis of three specimens from Zelaya  Province, Nicaragua, and noted that the glands were not prominent in  any of the specimens. Duellman (1956:8) showed that _Scytopis hebes_  (generotype of _Scytopis_ by monotypy) is a Phrynohyas, and thus  placed _Scytopis_ Cope, 1862, in the synonymy of _Phrynohyas_  Fitzinger, 1843.    Dunn and Emlen (1932:25) placed _Hyla lancasteri_ Barbour in the  synonymy of _Hyla boulengeri_; the former was known solely from one  juvenile. They made no"]]]
