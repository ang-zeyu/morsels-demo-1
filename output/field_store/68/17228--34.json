It is a small species that sometimes is  observed on the ground but was never seen ascending large trees. _Anolis  capito_ is about the same size as _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ and lives  on the trunks of large trees. In the tops of the trees lives a large  green species, _Anolis biporcatus_.    Similar segregation habitatwise can be demonstrated for other members of  the herpetofauna. The avoidance of interspecific competition in feeding  is well illustrated by three species of snakes that probably are the  primary ophidian predators on frogs. _Drymobius margaritiferus  margaritiferus_ is diurnal and terrestrial; it feeds on frogs at the  edges of breeding ponds by day. Also during the day _Leptophis mexicanus  mexicanus_ feeds on frogs in bushes and trees. At night the activities  of both of these species is replaced by those of _Leptodeira  septentrionalis polysticta_, which not only feeds on the frogs in the  trees and bushes, but descends to the ground and even enters the water  in search of food.    From the examples discussed above, the importance of the three  dimensional aspect of the rainforest is apparent. The presence of a  large and diverse habitat above the ground is of great significance in  the rainforest, for of the non-aquatic components of the herpetofauna in  the rainforests of southern El Peten, 42 per cent of the species spend  at least part of their lives in the bushes and trees. Another important  part of the forest is the subterranean level--the rich mulch,  underground tunnels, and rotting subterranean vegetation. Of the 78  species of amphibians and reptiles in southern El Peten, seven are  primarily fossorial, and half-a-dozen others are secondarily fossorial.  Probably the fossorial members of the fauna are the least well  represented in the collection, for such widespread species as _Dermophis  mexicanus mexicanus_, _Rhadinaea decorata decorata_ and _Tantilla  schistosa schistosa_ were expected, but not found.    In the following discussion of the ecological distribution of amphibians  and reptiles in the rainforest I have depended chiefly on my  observations made in southern El Peten, but have taken into  consideration observations made on the same species in other regions,  together with reports from other workers. The reader should keep in mind  that the evidence varies from species to species. Of some species I have  observed only one animal in the field; of others, I have seen scores and  sometimes hundreds of individuals. For species on which I have few  observations or rather inconclusive evidence, the circumstance of  inadequate data is mentioned.    In analyzing the ecological distribution within the forest, it is  convenient to recognize five subdivisions (habitats); each is treated  below as a unit.    1. AQUATIC.--This habitat includes permanent streams and rivers (Pl. 10,  fig. 1), some of which are clear and others muddy. In the rainy season  temporary ponds form in depressions on the forest floor (Pl. 10, fig.  2); these are important as breeding sites for many species of  amphibians. Aquatic members of the herpetofauna are here considered to  be those species that either spend the greatest part of their lives in  the water or usually retreat to water for shelter. Seven species of  turtles and one crocodilian are aquatic. Of these, _Dermatemys mawi_,  _Staurotypus triporcatus_, and _Pseudemys scripta ornata_ inhabit clear  water, whereas _Chelydra rossignoni_, _Claudius angustatus_,  _Kinosternon acutum_, and _K. leucostomum_ inhabit muddy water.  _Crocodylus moreleti_ apparently inhabits both clear and muddy water,  for in the dry season it lives along the clear rivers, but in the rainy  season inhabits flooded areas in the forest as well.    2. AQUATIC MARGIN.--Extensive marshes were lacking in the part of  southern El Peten that I visited; consequently, the aquatic margin  habitat is there limited to the edges of rivers and borders of temporary  ponds. _Bufo marinus_, _Rana palmipes_, and _Rana pipiens_ are  characteristic inhabitants of the aquatic margin, although in the rainy  reason _Bufo marinus_ often is found away from water. Observations  indicate that _Tretanorhinus nigroluteus lateralis_ inhabits the margins  of ponds and streams and actually spends considerable time in the water.  Although _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_ is arboreal, it lives in trees along  rivers, into which it plunges upon being disturbed. Species included in  this category are those that customarily spend most of their lives at  the edge of permanent water. Frogs and toads that migrate to the water  for breeding and the snakes that prey on the frogs at that time are not  assigned to the aquatic-margin habitat.    3. FOSSORIAL.--Characteristic inhabitants of the mulch on the forest  floor are _Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri_, _Lepidophyma flavimaculatum  flavimaculatum_, _Scincella cherriei cherriei_, _Ninia sebae sebae_,  _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_, and _Micrurus affinis apiatus_. Other  species of snakes that spend most of their lives above ground often  forage in the mulch layer; among these are _Coniophanes bipunctatus  biserialis_, _Coniophanes fissidens fissidens_, _Coniophanes imperialis  clavatus_, _Lampropeltis doliata polyzona_, and _Stenorrhina  degenhardti_. Among the amphibians, at least _Hypopachus cuneus  nigroreticulatus_, _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_, and _Syrrhophus  leprus_ are known to seek shelter in the mulch.    4. TERRESTRIAL.--One turtle, _Geoemyda areolata_, is primarily  terrestrial. Among the lizards, conspicuous terrestrial species are  _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_; _Anolis  lemurinus bourgeaei_ and _Basiliscus vittatus_ spend part of their lives  on the ground, but also live on trees and in bushes. _Eumeces  schwartzei_ and _E. sumichrasti_ apparently are terrestrial. The only  terrestrial lizard that is nocturnal is _Coleonyx elegans elegans_,  which by day hides in the leaf litter or below ground. Nocturnal  amphibians that are terrestrial include _Bufo marinus_, _Bufo valliceps  valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus_, _Syrrhophus  leprus_, and _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_. A large number of  active diurnal snakes are terrestrial; these include _Boa constrictor  imperator_, _Clelia clelia clelia_, _Dryadophis melanolomus laevis_,  _Drymarchon corais melanurus_, _Drymobius margaritiferus  margaritiferus_, _Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus_, and _Spilotes  pullatus mexicanus_. Nocturnal terrestrial snakes include three kinds of  _Bothrops_ (_B. atrox asper_, _B. nasutus_, and _B. nummifer nummifer_),  all of which seem to be equally active by day.    5. ARBOREAL.--In this habitat the third dimension (height) of  the rainforest probably is the most complex insofar as the  inter-relationships of species and ecological niches are concerned. I  have attempted to categorize species as to microhabitats within the  arboreal habitat; in so doing, I recognize four subdivisions--bushes,  tree trunks, tree tops, and epiphytes.    Bush inhabitants include several species of lizards and snakes, all of  which have rather elongate, slender bodies, and long tails. Common  bush-inhabitants in southern El Peten are _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_,  _Basiliscus vittatus_, _Laemanctus deborrei_, _Leptophis mexicanus  mexicanus_, and _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_. All of these are diurnal, and  all but _Laemanctus_ have been observed sleeping on bushes at night.    Tree-trunk inhabitants include five species of lizards. _Thecadactylus  rapicaudus_ lives on the trunks of large trees; _Sphaerodactylus  lineolatus_ lives beneath the bark on dead trees and on corozo palms.  _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ lives on the bases and buttresses of large  trees, from which it often descends to the ground. _Corythophanes  cristatus_ and _Anolis capito_ were found only on tree trunks and large  vines.    The least information is available for the species living in the tree  tops. The following species were obtained from tops of trees when they  were felled, or have been observed living in the tree tops: _Anolis  biporcatus_, _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_, _Celestus rozellae_,  _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, _Leptophis ahaetulla  praestans_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_.    Epiphytes, especially the bromeliads, provide refuge for a variety of  tree frogs and small snakes. Of the tree frogs, _Hyla picta_, _Hyla  staufferi_, _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, _Similisca baudini_, and  _Similisca phaeota cyanosticta_ have been found in bromeliads; other  species probably occur there. Among the snakes, _Imantodes cenchoa  leucomelas_, _Leptodeira frenata malleisi_, _Leptodeira septentrionalis  polysticta_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_  are frequent inhabitants of bromeliads; all of these snakes are  nocturnal.      Relationships of the Fauna    Most of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles definitely known from  the rainforest in southern El Peten have extensive ranges in the  Atlantic lowlands of southern Mexico and Central America; many extend  into South America. Sixty-two (80%) of the species belong to this group  having extensive ranges in Middle America. Three species (_Syrrhophus  leprus_, _Leptodeira frenata_, and _Kinosternon acutum_) are at the  southern limits of their distributions in southern El Peten and northern  Alta Verapaz, whereas _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ and _Thecadactylus  rapicaudus_ are at the northern and western limits of their  distributions in El Peten. Nine (11%) species have the center of their  distributions in El Peten and the Yucatan Peninsula; representatives of  this group include _Claudius angustatus_, _Dermatemys mawi_, _Laemanctus  deborrei_, and _Eumeces schwartzei_.

His presence for more than a year among the little band of white men  assembled at this remote fur-trading post on Hudson Bay must have had a  helpful influence in preparing Hearne for his great explorations  overland to the Arctic Ocean. This book is an account of three journeys  which he undertook in rapid succession into the country west of Hudson  Bay and north-west of Fort Prince of Wales in search of the fabled bed  of copper ore, from which pure copper could be loaded directly into  ships at trifling expense. In the first and second journeys he was  obliged to turn back before reaching his destination, but in the third  journey all difficulties were finally overcome, and he was taken to and  shown the \"mine\" of copper.    It has been my good fortune to travel over parts of the same country  through which Hearne had journeyed one hundred and twenty-three years  before me, and into which no white man had ventured during the  intervening time. The conditions which I found were just such as he  describes, except that the inhabitants had changed. The Chipewyan  Indians, whom he found occupying advantageous positions everywhere as  far as the north end of Dubawnt Lake, had disappeared, and in their  places the country had been occupied by scattered bands and families of  Eskimos, who had almost forgotten the ocean shores of the north, from  which they had come. They were depending entirely, for food and  clothing, on the caribou, which they killed on the banks of the inland  streams and lakes. Traces of old Indian encampments were seen in a few  of the scattered groves that are growing along the banks of Dubawnt and  Kazan Rivers, but these camps had evidently not been occupied for many  years.[3]    [Illustration: _Photo. J. B. Tyrrell, Oakley, 1894._  S. HEARNE'S NAME ON THE SMOOTH GLACIATED ROCK AT SLOOP'S COVE, NEAR  CHURCHILL]    Whether Hearne remained at Fort Prince of Wales after his return is not  certain, but it is possible that he may have gone to some of the other  factories near the southern shore of Hudson Bay, and the plans of  Albany, Moos, and Slude (East Main) Rivers, at the end of this book, the  first two of which are dated 1774, may have been made by him at this  time. In the latter year, however, he was at York Factory, and from  there, in May or June, he was sent inland to the Saskatchewan River,  where he established Cumberland House on Pine Island Lake, close to a  trading-post which had been previously built by Joseph Frobisher, an  enterprising merchant from Montreal. The following year he was recalled  to Hudson Bay to take charge of his old home, Fort Prince of Wales, in  the place of Governor Norton, who had died, and there he remained  quietly trading with the Indians till August 1782, when the fort was  taken and burnt by the French under Admiral La Perouse.    As soon as the French with three vessels of war appeared before the  fort and demanded its capitulation, Hearne surrendered at discretion,  without firing a shot. He was at once taken on board the French ships,  and allowed to retain all his private papers and effects, while the furs  and other property of the Hudson's Bay Company were either confiscated  or burnt. After pillaging and destroying the fort, La Perouse sailed  southward to York Factory, which also surrendered to him as soon as he  appeared before it, and then, with all his prisoners on board, including  the Governors of Fort Prince of Wales, York, and Severn, he sailed for  France.    Hearne does not appear to have been treated by La Perouse as an enemy  who had been taken prisoner at the capture of a hostile fort, but rather  as a literary man whom he was anxious to encourage and patronise. While  a prisoner on board the French ships he was treated with every  consideration, and his generous captor, who was one of the foremost  geographers of his time, read his manuscript journal with evident  interest, and returned it to him on the express condition that he would  print and publish it immediately on his arrival in England.    On the signing of peace with the French in the following year, Hearne  was sent back by the Hudson's Bay Company to Churchill. He made no  attempt to live again in the fort, which was very unfavourably situated  for obtaining both wood and water, but took up his residence on the site  of the original trading-post of the Hudson's Bay Company, five miles  south of Fort Prince of Wales, where the buildings of the Company stand  at the present day.    In 1784, while Hearne was at Churchill, there arrived from England a  boy, fourteen years old, named David Thompson, who afterwards became the  great geographer of North-Western America. Thompson remained at  Churchill for only one year, during which time he copied some of  Hearne's Journal, and though he did not carry away any very friendly  feelings towards his superior officer, the knowledge which he gained of  the interior country, and of the possibilities of travel through it,  must have had a stimulating effect on him in after life. His note-books,  which are now in possession of the Government of the Province of  Ontario, are filled with detailed information about North-Western  America, so much of which he subsequently explored. In 1787 Hearne left  Churchill and returned to England, and from that date until his death,  in 1792, he probably spent most of his time in revising and preparing  his Journal for publication.    Before discussing Hearne's character and the extent and value of his  work, it will be interesting to recount briefly the circumstances which  led up to the expedition to the Coppermine River. In the seventeenth  century the search for gold and silver monopolised the thoughts of many  of the adventurers in the Southern Seas, but those adventurers who  turned their attention to the more northern countries recognised that  there were other sources of wealth beside the precious metals. They saw  that the furs of many of the wild animals which roamed through the  forests might easily be obtained from the natives in exchange for  articles of European manufacture of but trifling value, and that these  furs might be sold in the markets of Europe and Asia at an enormous  profit. In this way what is known as the fur trade had its beginning on  the American continent.    The Dutch, French, and English strove for shares in this lucrative  trade, and many of the wars and massacres of that time had their origin  in the strenuous endeavours of one or other of these nations to outwit  its rivals. The Dutch had headquarters on the Hudson River, in what is  now the State of New York, the French on the St. Lawrence River, in the  present Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, while the English established  themselves on the shores of Hudson Bay, founding a fur-trading company,  which was destined to survive till the present time, and to be one of  the greatest commercial corporations that the world has ever known.    This Company was called \"The Governor and Company of Adventurers of  England, trading into Hudson's Bay,\" or in brief, \"The Hudson's Bay  Company.\" At first it occupied a few small buildings, called factories  or forts, situated at advantageous places near the mouths of rivers on  the shore of Hudson Bay, where the Indians, who were accustomed to roam  through the great unknown inland country, could come down in canoes to  trade their furs for guns, knives, and other commodities brought from  England by the white people.    About the beginning of the eighteenth century, some of the Indians who  came to the more northern factories or trading-posts, and especially to  those situated at the mouths of the Churchill and Nelson Rivers, brought  with them rough pieces of native copper, and ornaments and weapons  fashioned from this metal. On being asked where the copper came from,  they said that they found it on the banks of a river, far away to the  north, and that it could be collected from the surface in great  abundance, but that the distance through which it was necessary for them  to carry it prevented them from bringing much of it to the factories.  These stories, along with the specimens which the Indians had in their  possession, gradually aroused more and more interest in the minds of the  fur-traders. At last they determined that there were far greater riches  within their reach than could be obtained by trading with the Indians  for furs, and decided to go in search of the copper mines whatever the  cost of such a search might be. Among the first to take up this quest  was Captain James Knight, a man of about eighty years of age, who had  spent most of his life in trading for furs with the Indians, and who for  several years had been in charge of York Factory for the Hudson's Bay  Company. With him were Captain Barlow, another fur-trader from Fort  Albany, and Captain Vaughan.    When the Committee, appointed in 1748 by the British House of Commons to  inquire into the state and conditions of the countries adjoining Hudson  Bay, was taking evidence, one of the chief witnesses was a Captain  Carruthers, who in his evidence stated \"that he had heard a good deal of  a Copper Mine to the northward of the Churchill River--that the Governor  (Knight) was mighty fond of the Discovery, and made great inquiries  about it,--that the witness had seen copper which was said to be brought  from thence,--that the Governor (Knight) was very earnest in this  Discovery, which was always his topic.\"    Joseph Robson states that \"Governor Knight and Captain Barlow being well  assured that there were rich mines to the northward, from the accounts  of the Indians of those parts who had brought some of the ore to the  factory, they were bent upon making the discovery; and the Governor said  he knew the way to the place as well as to his bedside.\"[4]"]]]
