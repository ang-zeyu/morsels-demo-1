It  is formed from two Greek words, one (_lepis_) signifying a _scale_, and  the other (_pteron_) denoting a _wing_; and was applied by the great  naturalist Linnaeus to the scaly-winged insects popularly known as  Butterflies and Moths.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--SCALES FROM THE WINGS OF BUTTERFLIES.]    Every one of my readers has undoubtedly handled some of the interesting  creatures of this group--having been led to do so either by the extreme  beauty of their clothing, or, perhaps, from a murderous intent in order  to protect his own garments from the ravages of a supposed marauder. A  light mealy powder will probably have been observed afterwards on the  fingers that have touched the victim's wings.    This powder, although it sometimes presents a beautiful glossy surface  when spread over the skin, does not exhibit any definite form or  structure without a more minute examination. Yet these are the scales  that led the immortal naturalist to invent the somewhat long but useful  term _Lepidoptera_.    The very next time the opportunity offers itself, dust off a little of  the mealy powder with a small and very soft brush on to a strip of white  paper or a slip of glass, and examine it with a powerful lens or the low  power of a compound microscope. What a sight you will then behold! Each  little particle of dust is a beautifully formed scale, stamped with a  number of minute rounded projections, and often displaying the most  gorgeous colours. A great variety of designs and tints are often  exhibited by the 'dust' from a single wing. Take, for instance, for your  inspection, scales from the wing of one of our commonest insects, the  Small Tortoiseshell Butterfly (Plate III), and you will be surprised at  the pleasing contrasts. But when your curiosity leads you to deal with  others in the same manner, the varied display of forms and colours is  simply amazing.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--PORTION OF THE WING OF A BUTTERFLY FROM WHICH  SOME OF THE SCALES HAVE BEEN REMOVED.]    In order that we may learn still more of the structure of the wings of  the _Lepidoptera_, we will examine a portion of one from which some of  the scales have been removed, again bringing the lens or the microscope  into our service. We now see that the scales are arranged in rows with  great regularity on a thin and transparent membrane, which is supported  by a system of branching rays. And the membrane itself, in parts which  have been laid bare, is marked with regular rows of dots--the points at  which the scales were originally attached by means of short hollow rods.    The framework that supports the thin membrane we have spoken of as  consisting of a system of _rays_, but to these the terms _veins_,  _nerves_, _nervures_, or _nervules_ are more commonly applied by various  naturalists. We cannot do better, however, than adhere to the name  originally used, for the structures in question do not perform the  functions of veins, though at first they contain blood, nor are they  themselves parts of the nervous systems of the insects to which they  belong.    The result of our examination of the wings of butterflies and moths has  been to justify the application of the term _Lepidoptera_; but we must  now study other equally important and interesting features of the  structure of these insects. First, let us note the general form of the  body.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--BODY OF A BUTTERFLY--UNDER SIDE.    1-7, segments of the abdomen; 8, anal extremity; _a_, antennae; _b_,  tarsus; _c_, tibia; _d_, femur; _e_, palpi; _f_, head; _g_, thorax.]    A cursory glance at this portion of the creature's anatomy will show  that it consists of three distinct and well-defined parts. In front  there is the head, the size of which is somewhat small in proportion.  Two very large eyes make up the greater portion of its bulk. It is  remarkable, too, that butterflies possess eyes proportionately much  larger than those of moths. Now, since butterflies always fly by day,  and moths are, generally speaking, nocturnal insects, we might be led to  suppose that the reverse of this arrangement would have suited the  creatures better; for a small eye, we should think, would be able to  collect sufficient light in the daytime to form a bright image, and a  larger light-receiving area would be necessary during the darker hours  for the same purpose. But it is evident that the sense of vision must  depend on other conditions besides the size of the eye; and as these  conditions are not understood in relation to the eyes of insects, any  attempt at an explanation would be quite useless.    The eye of a butterfly or moth is worthy of a closer examination, for it  is a most beautiful and marvellous structure. The outer globular  transparent membrane--the _cornea_--is divided into a large number of  minute polygonal _facets_, each one of which admits light into a small  conical compartment surrounded by a coloured membrane, and supplied with  a fibre of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34165"],[0,"Birds Illustrated (#3)"],[1,"man, they would soon  become thoroughly domesticated. Trapped and hunted as they are with  dog and gun it is not strange that as a whole they remain timid and  mistrustful, and were they not naturally birds of civilization would  rapidly disappear with the settlement of the country. As it is, they  seem to realize that man is only at times their enemy, and that his  cultivated fields afford them a safe refuge from many other enemies,  and insure a more certain and bountiful supply of food than found  elsewhere.\"    Quails destroy injurious insects and seeds of weeds, upon which they  largely feed. When startled they rise with a loud whirring sound, their  flight being very swift, low, and direct, a rather laborious effort.  They move about in small coveys or family groups, pairing during the  nesting season, and share alike in the duties of protecting and rearing  the young.    The nest is placed on the ground, in a depression, usually in the grass  upon the prairies, sometimes in a thicket, under a low bush. It is  usually arched over with grass, with entrance on the side.    From fifteen to twenty pure white eggs are usually laid.    S. P. Cheney pleasantly says: \"Familiar as I have been with almost all  parts of Vermont for more than thirty years, I have seen only one Quail  in the state, and he was evidently a 'tramp.' I heard him just at night,  the first day of July, 1884. Did not get sight of him till the next  morning, when he came out into the sun, stood on the top rail of a  fence, warmed himself, and whistled his spirited, forceful tune, his  solid little body swelling and throbbing at every note, especially when  he rose to the tonic. I was prepared for him, and made an exact copy of  what he gave: _Bob, Bob, White! Bob White! Bob, Bob, White!_ After the  performance he stood, evidently listening for a reply; none came, and  without another note he disappeared, to be seen no more.\"          BIRDS IN THE SCHOOLS.      The movement to protect the birds of America and prevent them from being  transformed into millinery in such prodigious numbers, is having a  marked revival in many parts of the country, especially in the state  of New York. In New York City there was recently held a large public  meeting, under the auspices of the Audubon Society and the American  Museum of Natural History, to protest against the wholesale and  indiscriminate destruction of native birds for personal adornment. State  Superintendent of Schools Skinner of that state has established a \"bird  day\" in the public schools in connection with Arbor Day, in which the  pupils will be taught the great value of birds to mankind. Mr. Skinner  also has in preparation a manual upon the subject, 100,000 copies of  which he will have distributed among the New York state schools.    Public ignorance regarding the value of birds in the economy of  nature and especially to human life is so great as to be almost  incomprehensible. A number of estimates recently made by Morris K.  Jesup, President of the American Museum of Natural History, show how  important it is that a stronger safe-guard, in the shape of public  sentiment, should be thrown about our feathered benefactors. In a late  interview upon this subject, Mr. Jesup said:    \"Among the birds most worn this winter are the Herons, which are killed  for their aigrettes; the Terns, or Sea Swallows and Gulls; in short  mostly marsh and maritime birds.\" It is known that the killing of a  great number of these shore birds has been followed by an increase in  human mortality among the inhabitants of the coast, the destroyed birds  having formerly assisted in keeping the beaches and bayous free from  decaying animal matter. New Orleans had a plague of bugs about the  middle of September, just when the yellow fever began, and, strange as  it may seem, the bugs proved far more troublesome than the disease, and  certainly the annoyance was more immediate. The people called it a  mystery, but the scientists said it was merely the result of man's  improvidence in destroying the birds. The destruction has been going on  in Louisiana, particularly on the Gulf coast, for years, and has been  carried on by professional hunters, who kill the birds solely for  millinery purposes. Nature revenged herself on New Orleans, as she will  on every place where birds are destroyed for fashionable purposes.    Would it not be a good thing to increase the intelligence of the present  and rising generation respecting the value of birds by introducing into  the schools of every state in the Union the idea which has been adopted  by State Superintendent Skinner? And we respectfully suggest that the  use of this magazine by teachers, through the wise co-operation of  school boards, everywhere, as a text book, would quickly supply the  knowledge of bird-life and utility so sadly needed by the community. We  present some of the innocent creatures each month in accurate outline  and color, and the dullest pupil cannot fail to be impressed by their  beauty and the necessity for their protection. \"Our schools, public and  private, can hardly be criticised as instructors in the common branches  of learning, but they could also teach the rising generation the equally  important truths relating to the material world with which we are  encircled.\" In Colorado and in some other states Boards of Education  have supplied their teachers with BIRDS in sufficient quantities to  enable their pupils to study the subjects in the most profitable manner.                                                    --C. C. MARBLE.          THE PASSENGER PIGEON.      If the reader is interested in numbers, he will appreciate the  statement written about 1808 by Wilson, who estimated that a flock  of Wild Pigeons observed by him near Frankfort, Kentucky, contained  at least 2,230,272,000 individuals. If he is also interested in the aspect  presented by these birds in flight, cloud-like in form and apparently  boundless in extent, he will read the full and graphic descriptions  given by Audubon. In 1863, when the writer was a boy, he remembers  seeing the birds brought to town in barrels and sold at a price which  did not justify transportation to market. What appeared to be a cloud,  dark and lowering, was not infrequently seen approaching, soon to shut  out the light of the sun, until the birds which composed it, on the way  to or from their feeding or roosting places, had passed on. Now hear  what Major Bendire, as late as 1892, says: \"It looks now as if their  total extermination might be accomplished within the present century.  The only thing which retards their complete extinction is that it no  longer pays to net these birds, they being too scarce for this now, at  least in the more settled portions of the country, and also, perhaps,  that from constant and unremitting persecution on their breeding  grounds, they have changed their habits somewhat, the majority no longer  breeding in colonies, but scattering over the country and breeding in  isolated pairs.\"    The natural home of the Wild Pigeon is within the wooded lands, and  they are seldom met with upon the broad prairies. Audubon observed  that it was almost entirely influenced in its migrations by the abundance  of its food, that temperature had little to do with it, as they not  infrequently moved northward in large columns as early as the 7th of  March, with a temperature twenty degrees below the freezing point.    \"The Wild Pigeons are capable of propelling themselves in long continued  flights and are known to move with an almost incredible rapidity,  passing over a great extent of country in a very short time.\" Pigeons  have been captured in the state of New York with their crops still  filled with the undigested grains of rice that must have been taken in  the distant fields of Georgia or South Carolina, apparently proving that  they must have passed over the intervening space within a very few  hours. Audubon estimated the rapidity of their flight as at least a mile  a minute.    The Wild Pigeon is remarkable for its ease and grace, whether on the  ground or the limbs of trees. Though living, moving, and feeding  together in large companies, they mate in pairs. Several broods are  reared in a season, nesting beginning very early in the spring. The  nests are placed on trees, being a slight platform structure of twigs,  without any material for lining whatever. Two white eggs are laid.    Mr. Goss says (1891) that the Passenger Pigeon is still to be found in  numbers within the Indian Territory and portions of the southern states,  and in Kansas a few breed occasionally in the Neosho Valley.          THE PASSENGER PIGEON.      Some people call us the Wild Pigeon and the Gypsy among birds. We do  wander long distances in search of food, and when we have eaten all the  beech nuts in one part of the country, take wing, and away we go like a  great army to another place.    And such an army! We form in a column eight or ten miles long, thousands  and thousands of us, our approach sounding like a gale among the rigging  of a vessel. Not always in a straight course do we go, but in a winding  way looking for all the world, against the sky, like a vast river. Then  our leaders give the word, our captains, you know, and we form in a  straight line, sweeping along as you have seen regiments of soldiers  marching on parade. We are just as fond of forming new figures as they  are, and our captains, by their actions, give their orders much in the  same way.    \"Down, Up! Right, Left!\" and away we go forming our evolutions in the  air.    But you should see us when Mr. Hawk attacks our flock. Then, like a  torrent, and with a noise like thunder, we rush into one compact mass,  each pressing upon the other toward the center. Swiftly we descend  almost to the earth, then up again, forming as we do a straight column,  twisting, turning, looking, when far up in the air, like a great"]]]
