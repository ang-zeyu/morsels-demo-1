The brutal sport of cockfighting  was a popular pastime with our ancestors until prohibited by law, and is  still prevalent in many lands. In early times birds of prey were  captured when very young and carefully trained to hunt for their  masters. Under the feudal system there were regulations prescribing the  kinds of birds which different classes of men might use in this way: the  eagle and vulture were for emperors only; the gyrfalcon for kings; the  lesser falcons for nobles; the harrier for esquires; the merlin for  ladies; the goshawk for yeomen; the kestrel for servants; the sparrow  hawk for priests.    Much of the value of various kinds of poultry comes from their ability  to destroy insects which damage vegetation, and to maintain themselves  on these and on foods not available for the larger domestic mammals. The  services of poultry in this respect being limited to those insects that  can be secured from the ground, and to areas on which the birds can live  safely and do no damage to crops, we are dependent upon wild aerial  birds to keep insect life in check on trees and high bushes and on land  not occupied by poultry.    =Place of wild birds in civilization.= As no insect-eating aerial birds  have been domesticated, the preservation of wild birds that destroy  insects is of as much importance to man as the production of domestic  birds. Indeed, the wild birds are much more valuable to us in the wild  state than they would be if domesticated.    In nature species prey upon each other--the lowest forms of life upon  inorganic and decayed matter, the higher forms upon the lower, the  larger creatures upon the smaller, the savage upon the defenseless.  Fertile lands not only produce luxuriant vegetation but teem with insect  life, which, if not kept in check, would soon destroy that vegetation.  In tropical and semitropical regions there are mammals, some of them  quite large, which feed upon insects. In temperate regions where insects  are not to be obtained during the winter, there would be no adequate  check upon their increase and the consequent destruction of vegetation  if it were not for the vast numbers of insect-eating migratory birds  which come to these regions for the summer. Necessary as these birds are  to vegetation on uncultivated lands, they are more necessary in  cultivated fields, orchards, and gardens where the crops are more  attractive to insects than the mixed vegetation on wild lands. As insect  destroyers the domestic birds that are kept on cultivated lands only  fill the place of the nonmigratory wild birds that have been driven away  or exterminated. So it is to the interest of every one to protect  insect-eating wild birds, for although these birds may do some damage to  crops, their service usually more than pays for it.    =Classes of domestic birds.= There are three classes of domestic  birds--poultry, pigeons, and cage birds. The poultry class comprises  land and water birds and contains nine kinds--fowls, ducks, geese,  turkeys, guineas, peafowls, pheasants, swans, and ostriches. The pigeon  class has but one kind, the pigeon, which is the only aerial bird  domesticated for economic purposes. The cage-bird class has as its most  important representative the canary. The other birds of this class have  never been popular in America.    The question of increasing the number of species of birds in  domestication interests many people. There is a general impression among  those not familiar with the commercial aspect of aviculture that many  more species might be domesticated. While it is true that many birds  capable of domestication have not been domesticated, there are few of  these that would serve any purpose not better served by some species  already domesticated. It will be shown as the different kinds and  varieties of domestic birds are discussed that the most useful kinds are  always the most popular, and that many others are kept principally as  ornaments. The number of ornamental creatures that can be kept in  domestication is limited, for as a rule animals, like people, must earn  their living.          CHAPTER II    CHARACTERS AND HABITS OF BIRDS RELATED TO USE      =Feathers.= The feathers of a bird are the most highly developed form of  protective covering in animals, serving other important functions in  addition to the primary one. Compared with the hair of a mammal or the  scale of a fish or of a reptile, a typical soft feather from the body of  a bird is a very complex structure, partaking of the characters of both  scales and hair. The fact that birds have scales and hair as well as  feathers shows their relation to these other forms of animal covering.  This is best observed on a fowl. The legs of a fowl are normally smooth,  with scales on the front of the shank and on the upper surfaces of the  toes. In feather-legged fowls the feathers appear first along the outer  sides of the shanks and toes. As the number of feathers is increased  they grow longer and more feathers appear, until in the most heavily  feathered specimens the soft skin is covered and the scales are almost  hidden.    The face of a fowl is normally almost bare, the skin being a bright red  like the comb and wattles; but at a distance of a few feet we can  usually see some very small, fine feathers on it, and if we examine  closely we see in addition still finer growths--hairs. Among the body  feathers of a fowl, too, are quite long hairs. These are most easily  observed after a bird is plucked. They do not come out with the  feathers, and are removed by singeing.    =Structure of feathers.= The smallest feather that to the naked eye  appears as something more complex than a hair, looks like a little bunch  of fuzzy filaments. This is called down.    In the next higher form of feather a small round quill appears with  filaments protruding from it like the hairs in an artist's brush. Such  a feather is called a stub feather, or simply a stub. The best place to  find these is on the outside of the shank of a fowl with scantily  feathered legs.    The first form of the complete feather is best observed either on the  head of a fowl or at the hock joint. The feathers in these places are  very small, yet complete. The round quill is lengthened into a shaft.  Extending from each side of this shaft is a single row of filaments,  called barbs, the edges of which, interlocked with little hooks, form  the web of the feather. On other parts of the body of the bird the  feathers are larger, but the general structure is always the same. The  size and special structure of the feather are always adjusted to suit  the part on which it grows or the service which it has to perform.    As the first function of the feathers is to keep the bird dry and warm,  the body feathers are all soft as compared with the large stiff feathers  of the wings and tail; yet as we look at the feathers on different parts  of the body of a bird we notice differences in their structure, and also  notice that the structure of a feather is not always the same throughout  its length. On the exposed parts of the feathers of the neck, back,  wings, and breast the web is perfect and the feathers overlap so closely  that they present a smooth surface. Under the surface, especially next  the skin, the barbs are not smoothly joined, but are fluffy. Thus the  same feathers which present a hard, smooth surface to the weather  provide a soft, warm garment next the skin. Under the wings and on the  underside of the body the feathers are quite fluffy throughout their  whole length.    =Arrangement of the feathers.= As you look at a living bird the feathers  appear to grow on all parts of the body. When the feathers are removed  from the bird you see that while the skin is nearly all rough, with the  little elevations where the feathers were removed, there are quite large  areas where the skin is perfectly smooth, showing that no feathers grew  there. These places are bare because feathers on them would interfere  with the movements of the bird. The feathers on adjacent parts give the  smooth areas sufficient protection.    =Decorative feather forms.= The natural decorative forms of plumage are  found mostly in male birds and consist of extraordinary developments of  the plumage of the neck and back, where the male birds of some species  always have feathers differing in form from the feathers on the same  parts of the female. When a feather appendage not common to a species is  developed on some varieties, as the crest and beard on fowls and the  ruff on pigeons, both sexes have it. The most interesting feather  decorations will be described particularly in the chapters on the  species on which they occur.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Brown Leghorn chick (one day old)]    =Color in feathers.= While colors in the plumage are distributed very  differently in different species of birds, often making combinations  peculiar to a species, there is in all the same wonderful formation of  patterns, that depends for its effect in a section upon some overlapping  feathers being marked alike and others having a different marking; and  for the effect in a single feather, upon adjacent barbs being now alike,  now different, in the distribution of the pigment in them. The best  common example of a pattern covering a series of feathers is found on  the wing of a Mallard Duck or of a Rouen Duck. Interesting examples of  the formation of patterns on a single feather may be found in the  plumage of barred, laced, and penciled fowls, and also in the lacings on  the body feathers of the females of the varieties of ducks mentioned.  Perhaps the most interesting illustrations of this kind, however, are to  be seen on the plain feathers of the guinea and the gorgeous tail of the  peacock.
