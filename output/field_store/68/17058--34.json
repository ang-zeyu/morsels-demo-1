It has  sometimes been thought that the red men came to America by way of the  Kurile Islands, Kamchatka, and the Aleutian Islands. If this was their  route, they avoided a migration of two or three thousand miles through  one of the coldest and most inhospitable of regions. This, however,  is far from probable. The distance from Kamchatka to the first of the  Aleutian Islands is over one hundred miles. As the island is not in  sight from the mainland, there is little chance that a band of savages,  including women, would deliberately sail thither. There is equally  little probability that they walked to the island on the ice, for the  sea is never frozen across the whole width. Nevertheless the climate may  at that time have been colder than now. There is also a chance that a  party of savages may have been blown across to the island in a storm.  Suppose that they succeeded in reaching Bering Island, as the most  Asiatic of the Aleutians is called, the next step to Copper Island would  be easy. Then, however, there comes a stretch of more than two hundred  miles. The chances that a family would ever cross this waste of ocean  are much smaller than in the first case. Still another possibility  remains. Was there once a bridge of land from Asia to America in this  region? There is no evidence of such a link between the two continents,  for a few raised beaches indicate that during recent geological times  the Aleutian Islands have been uplifted rather than depressed.    The passage from Asia to America at Bering Strait, on the other hand,  is comparatively easy. The Strait itself is fifty-six miles wide, but  in the middle there are two small islands so that the longest stretch  of water is only about thirty-five miles. Moreover the Strait is usually  full of ice, which frequently becomes a solid mass from shore to shore.  Therefore it would be no strange thing if some primitive savages, in  hunting for seals or polar bears, crossed the Strait, even though they  had no boats. Today the people on both sides of the Strait belong to  the American race. They still retain traditions of a time when their  ancestors crossed this narrow strip of water. The Thilanottines have  a legend that two giants once fought fiercely on the Arctic Ocean. One  would have been defeated had not a man whom he had befriended cut the  tendon of his adversary's leg. The wounded giant fell into Bering Strait  and formed a bridge across which the reindeer entered America. Later  came a strange woman bringing iron and copper. She repeated her visits  until the natives insulted her, whereupon she went underground with her  fire-made treasures and came back no more. Whatever may have been the  circumstances that led the earliest families to cross from Asia to  America, they little recked that they had found a new continent and that  they were the first of the red race.    Unless the first Americans came to the new continent by way of the  Kurile and Aleutian Islands, it was probably their misfortune to  spend many generations in the cold regions of northeastern Asia and  northwestern America. Even if they reached Alaska by the Aleutian route  but came to the islands by way of the northern end of the Kamchatkan  Peninsula, they must have dwelt in a place where the January temperature  averages -10 degrees F. and where there are frosts every month in the  year. If they came across Bering Strait, they encountered a still more  severe climate. The winters there are scarcely worse than in northern  Kamchatka, but the summers are as cold as the month of March in New York  or Chicago.    Perhaps a prolonged sojourn in such a climate is one reason for  the stolid character of the Indians. Of course we cannot speak with  certainty, but we must, in our search for an explanation, consider the  conditions of life in the far north. Food is scanty at all times, and  starvation is a frequent visitor, especially in winter when game is hard  to get. The long periods of cold and darkness are terribly enervating.  The nervous white man goes crazy if he stays too long in Alaska. Every  spring the first boats returning to civilization carry an unduly large  proportion of men who have lost their minds because they have endured  too many dark, cold winters. His companions say of such a man, \"The  North has got him.\" Almost every Alaskan recognizes the danger. As one  man said to a friend, \"It is time I got out of here.\"    \"Why?\" said the friend, \"you seem all right. What's the matter?\"    \"Well,\" said the other, \"you see I begin to like the smell of skunk  cabbage, and, when a man gets that way, it's time he went somewhere  else.\"    The skunk cabbage, by the way, grows in Alaska in great thickets ten  feet high. The man was perfectly serious, for he meant that his mind was  beginning to act in ways that were not normal. Nowhere is the strain of  life in the far north better described than in the poems of Robert W.  Service.    Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand, As I  blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land;  Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heartbreaking  woes, And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough  knows! North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain  Passed like a dream I slept to lose and waked to dream again. River  and plain and mighty peak--and who could stand unawed? As their summits  blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God. North,  aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes, And  all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes, Till  at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill, And I  burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill. *          * From \"Ballads of a Cheechako.\"      The human organism inherits so delicate an adjustment to climate that,  in spite of man's boasted ability to live anywhere, the strain of the  frozen North eliminates the more nervous and active types of mind. Only  those can endure whose nerves lack sensitiveness and who are able to  bear long privation and the strain of hunger and cold and darkness.  Though the Indian may differ from the white man in many respects, such  conditions are probably as bad for him as for any race. For this reason  it is not improbable that long sojourns at way stations on the cold,  Alaskan route from central Asia may have weeded out certain types of  minds. Perhaps that is why the Indian, though brave, stoical, and hardy,  does not possess the alert, nervous temperament which leads to invention  and progress.    The ancestors of the red man unwittingly chose the easiest path  to America and so entered the continent first, but this was their  misfortune. They could not inherit the land because they chose a path  whose unfavorable influence, exerted throughout centuries, left them  unable to cope with later arrivals from other directions. The parts of  America most favorable for the Indian are also best for the white man  and Negro. There the alerter minds of the Europeans who migrated in the  other direction have quickly eliminated the Indian. His long northern  sojourn may be the reason why farther south in tropical lands he is even  now at a disadvantage compared with the Negro or with the coolie from  the East Indies. In Central America, for instance, it is generally  recognized that Negroes stand the heat and moisture of the lowlands  better than Indians. According to a competent authority: \"The American  Indians cannot bear the heat of the tropics even as well as the  European, not to speak of the African race. They perspire little, their  skin becomes hot, and they are easily prostrated by exertion in an  elevated temperature. They are peculiarly subject to diseases of hot  climates, as hepatic disorders, showing none of the immunity of the  African. Furthermore, the finest physical specimens of the race are  found in the colder regions of the temperate zones, the Pampas and  Patagonian Indians in the south, the Iroquois and Algonkins in  the north; whereas, in the tropics they are generally undersized,  short-lived, of inferior muscular force and with slight tolerance of  disease.\" * \"No one,\" adds another observer, \"could live among  the Indians of the Upper Amazon without being struck with their  constitutional dislike to heat. The impression forced itself upon my  mind that the Indian lives as a stranger or immigrant in these hot  regions.\" * * Thus when compared with the other inhabitants of America,  from every point of view the Indian seems to be at a disadvantage, much  of which may be due to the path which he took from the Old World to the  New.          * D. G. Brinton, \"The American Race,\" pp. 34, 35.          * * H. W. Bates, \"The Naturalist on the River Amazons.\" vol.II,  pp. 200, 201.      Before the red man lost his American heritage, he must have enjoyed it  for thousands upon thousands of years. Otherwise he never could have  become so different from his nearest relative, the Mongol. The two are  as truly distinct races as are the white man and the Malay. Nor could  the Indians themselves have become so extraordinarily diverse except  during the lapse of thousands of years. The Quichua of the cold  highlands of Peru is as different from the Maya of Yucatan or the Huron  of southern Canada as the Swede is from the Armenian or the Jew.  The separation of one stock from another has gone so far that almost  countless languages have been developed. In the United States alone  the Indians have fifty-five \"families\" of languages and in the whole of  America there are nearly two hundred such groups. These comprise over  one thousand distinct languages which are mutually unintelligible and at  least as different as Spanish and Italian. Such differences might arise  in a day at the Tower of Babel, but in the processes of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30666"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#3)"],[1," so fine an imitator that it is hard to  believe he is not doing more than mimicking the notes of other birds,  but rather that he really does mock them with a sort of defiant  sarcasm. He banters them less, perhaps, than the Cat Bird, but one  would naturally expect all other birds to fly at him with vengeful  purpose. But perhaps the birds are not so sensitive as their human  brothers, who do not always look upon imitation as the highest  flattery.    A gentleman who kept a note-book, describes one of the matinee  performances of the Mocker, which he attended by creeping under a tent  curtain. He sat at the foot of a tree on the top of which the bird was  perched unconscious of his presence. The Mocker gave one of the notes  of the Guinea-hen, a fine imitation of the Cardinal, or Red Bird,  an exact reproduction of the note of the Phoebe, and some of the  difficult notes of the Yellow-breasted Chat. \"Now I hear a young  chicken peeping. Now the Carolina Wren sings, '_cheerily, cheerily,  cheerily_.' Now a small bird is shrilling with a fine insect tone. A  Flicker, a Wood-pewee, and a Phoebe follow in quick succession. Then a  Tufted Titmouse squeals. To display his versatility, he gives a dull  performance which couples the '_go-back_' of the Guinea fowl with the  plaint of the Wood-pewee, two widely diverse vocal sounds. With all  the performance there is such perfect self-reliance and consciousness  of superior ability that one feels that the singer has but to choose  what bird he will imitate next.\"    Nor does the plaintive, melancholy note of the Robin, that \"pious\"  bird, altogether express his character. He has so many lovely traits,  according to his biographers, that we accept him unhesitatingly as a  truly good bird. Didn't he once upon a time tenderly cover with leaves  certain poor little wanderers? Isn't he called \"The Bird of the  Morning?\" And evening as well, for you can hear his sad voice long  after the sun has himself retired.    The poet Coleridge claims the credit of first using the Owl's cry  in poetry, and his musical note _Tu-whit, tu-who!_ has made him a  favorite with the poets. Tennyson has fancifully played upon it in  his little \"Songs to the Owl,\" the last stanza of which runs:        \"I would mock thy chant anew;      But I cannot mimic it,      Not a whit of thy tuhoo,      Thee to woo to thy tuwhit,      Thee to woo to thy tuwhit.        With a lengthen'd loud halloo,      Tuwhoo, tuwhit, tuwhit, tuhoo-o-o.\"    But Coleridge was not correct in his claim to precedence in the use of  the Owl's cry, for Shakespeare preceded him, and Tennyson's \"First  Song to the Owl\" is modeled after that at the end of \"Love's Labor  Lost:\"        \"When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,      Then nightly sings the staring Owl,                Tu-who;      Tu-whit, tu-who, a merry note.\"    In references to birds, Tennyson is the most felicitous of all poets  and the exquisite swallow-song in \"The Princess\" is especially  recommended to the reader's perusal.    Birds undoubtedly sing for the same reasons that inspire to utterance  all the animated creatures in the universe. Insects sing and bees,  crickets, locusts, and mosquitos. Frogs sing, and mice, monkeys,  and woodchucks. We have recently heard even an English Sparrow do  something better than chipper; some very pretty notes escaped him,  perchance, because his heart was overflowing with love-thoughts, and  he was very merry, knowing that his affection was reciprocated. The  elevated railway stations, about whose eaves the ugly, hastily built  nests protrude everywhere, furnish ample explanation of his reasons  for singing.    Birds are more musical at certain times of the day as well as at  certain seasons of the year. During the hour between dawn and sunrise  occurs the grand concert of the feathered folk. There are no concerts  during the day--only individual songs. After sunset there seems to be  an effort to renew the chorus, but it cannot be compared to the  morning concert when they are practically undisturbed by man.    Birds sing because they are happy. Bradford Torrey has given with much  felicity his opinion on the subject, as follows:    \"I recall a Cardinal Grosbeak, whom I heard several years ago, on the  bank of the Potomac river. An old soldier had taken me to visit the  Great Falls, and as we were clambering over the rocks this Grosbeak  began to sing; and soon, without any hint from me, and without knowing  who the invisible musician was, my companion remarked upon the  uncommon beauty of the song. The Cardinal is always a great singer,  having a voice which, as European writers say, is almost equal to the  Nightingale's; but in this case the more stirring, martial quality of  the strain had given place to an exquisite mellowness, as if it were,  what I have no doubt it was,                          A Song of Love.\"                                --C. C. Marble.    [TO BE CONTINUED.]          [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff. YELLOW-THROATED VIREO.]      THE YELLOW-THROATED VIREO.      The popular name of this species of an attractive family is Yellow  Throated Greenlet, and our young readers will find much pleasure in  watching its pretty movements and listening to its really delightful  song whenever they visit the places where it loves to spend the happy  hours of summer. In some respects it is the most remarkable of all  the species of the family found in the United States. \"The Birds  of Illinois,\" a book that may be profitably studied by the young  naturalist, states that it is decidedly the finest singer, has the  loudest notes of admonition and reproof, and is the handsomest in  plumage, and hence the more attractive to the student.    A recognized observer says he has found it only in the woods, and  mostly in the luxuriant forests of the bottom lands. The writer's  experience accords with that of Audubon and Wilson, the best  authorities in their day, but the habits of birds vary greatly with  locality, and in other parts of the country, notably in New England,  it is very familiar, delighting in the companionship of man. It breeds  in eastern North America, and winters in Florida, Cuba and Central  America.    The Vireo makes a very deep nest, suspended by its upper edge,  between the forks of a horizontal branch. The eggs are white,  generally with a few reddish brown blotches. All authorities agree as  to the great beauty of the nest, though they differ as to its exact  location. It is a woodland bird, loving tall trees and running water,  \"haunting the same places as the Solitary Vireo.\" During migration the  Yellow-throat is seen in orchards and in the trees along side-walks  and lawns, mingling his golden colors with the rich green of June  leaves.    The Vireos, or Greenlets, are like the Warblers in appearance and  habits. We have no birds, says Torrey, that are more unsparing of  their music; they sing from morning till night, and--some of them, at  least--continue theirs till the very end of the season. The song of  the Yellow-throat is rather too monotonous and persistent. It is hard  sometimes not to get out of patience with its ceasless and noisy  iteration of its simple tune; especially if you are doing your utmost  to catch the notes of some rarer and more refined songster. This is  true also of some other birds, whose occasional silence would add much  to their attractiveness.          THE MOCKING BIRD.      Some bright morning this month, you may hear a Robin's song from a  large tree near by. A Red Bird answers him and then the Oriole chimes  in. I can see you looking around to find the birds that sing so  sweetly. All this time a gay bird sits among the green leaves and  laughs at you as you try to find three birds when only one is there.    It is the Mocking Bird or Mocker, and it is he who has been fooling  you with his song. Nature has given him lots of music and gifted him  with the power of imitating the songs of other birds and sounds of  other animals.    He is certainly the sweetest of our song birds. The English  Nightingale alone is his rival. I think, however, if our Mocker could  hear the Nightingale's song, he could learn it.    The Mocking Bird is another of our Thrushes. By this time you have  surely made up your minds that the Thrushes are sweet singers.    The Mocker seems to take delight in fooling people. One gentleman  while sitting on his porch heard what he thought to be a young bird in  distress. He went in the direction of the sound and soon heard the  same cry behind him. He turned and went back toward the porch, when he  heard it in another direction. Soon he found out that Mr. Mocking Bird  had been fooling him, and was flying about from shrub to shrub making  that sound.    His nest is carelessly made of almost anything he can find. The small,  bluish-green eggs are much like the Catbird's eggs.    Little Mocking Birds look very much like the young of other Thrushes,  and do not become Mockers like their parents, until they are full  grown.    Which one of the other Thrushes that you have seen in BIRDS does the  Mocking Bird resemble?    He is the only Thrush that sings while on the wing. All of the others  sing only while perching.

Frank-hearted hostess of the field and wood,      Gipsy, whose roof is every spreading tree,      June is the pearl of our New England year,      Still a surprisal, though expected long,      Her coming startles. Long she lies in wait,      Makes many a feint, peeps forth, draws coyly back,      Then, from some southern ambush in the sky,      With one great gush of blossoms storms the world.      A week ago the Sparrow was divine;      The Bluebird, shifting his light load of song      From post to post along the cheerless fence,      Was as a rhymer ere the poet came;      But now, O rapture! sunshine winged and voiced,      Pipe blown"]]]
