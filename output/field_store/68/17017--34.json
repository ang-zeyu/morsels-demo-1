[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication â€” Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"experience on this subject, has likewise assured me that  this sometimes occurs.) but the reversion in this instance is not to a very  ancient period, for the best existing varieties of the heartsease are of  comparatively modern origin. With most of our cultivated vegetables there is  some tendency to reversion to what is known to be, or may be presumed to be,  their aboriginal state; and this would be more evident if gardeners did not  generally look over their beds of seedlings, and pull up the false plants or  \"rogues\" as they are called. It has already been remarked, that some few  seedling apples and pears generally resemble, but apparently are not identical  with, the wild trees from which they are descended. In our turnip (13/8.  'Gardener's Chronicle' 1855 page 777.) and carrot-beds a few plants often  \"break \"--that is, flower too soon; and their roots are generally hard and  stringy, as in the parent-species. By the aid of a little selection, carried  on during a few generations, most of our cultivated plants could probably be  brought back, without any great change in their conditions of life, to a wild  or nearly wild condition: Mr. Buckman has effected this with the parsnip  (13/9. Ibid 1862 page 721.); and Mr. Hewett C. Watson, as he informs me,  selected, during three generations, \"the most diverging plants of Scotch kail,  perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage; and in the third  generation some of the plants came very close to the forms now established in  England about old castle-walls, and called indigenous.\"    REVERSION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS WHICH HAVE RUN WILD.    In the cases hitherto considered, the reverting animals and plants have not  been exposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which  could have induced this tendency; but it is very different with animals and  plants which have become feral or run wild. It has been repeatedly asserted in  the most positive manner by various authors, that feral animals and plants  invariably return to their primitive specific type. It is curious on what  little evidence this belief rests. Many of our domesticated animals could not  subsist in a wild state; thus, the more highly improved breeds of the pigeon  will not \"field\" or search for their own food. Sheep have never become feral,  and would be destroyed by almost every beast of prey. (13/10. Mr. Boner speaks  ('Chamois-hunting' 2nd edition 1860 page 92) of sheep often running wild in  the Bavarian Alps; but, on making further inquiries at my request, he found  that they are not able to establish themselves; they generally perish from the  frozen snow clinging to their wool, and they have lost the skill necessary to  pass over steep icy slopes. On one occasion two ewes survived the winter, but  their lambs perished.) In several cases we do not know the aboriginal parent-  species, and cannot possibly tell whether or not there has been any close  degree of reversion. It is not known in any instance what variety was first  turned out; several varieties have probably in some cases run wild, and their  crossing alone would tend to obliterate their proper character. Our  domesticated animals and plants, when they run wild, must always be exposed to  new conditions of life, for, as Mr. Wallace (13/11. See some excellent remarks  on this subject by Mr. Wallace 'Journal Proc. Linn. Soc.' 1858 volume 3 page  60.) has well remarked, they have to obtain their own food, and are exposed to  competition with the native productions. Under these circumstances, if our  domesticated animals did not undergo change of some kind, the result would be  quite opposed to the conclusions arrived at in this work. Nevertheless, I do  not doubt that the simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral, does  cause some tendency to reversion to the primitive state; though this tendency  has been much exaggerated by some authors.    [I will briefly run through the recorded cases. With neither horses nor cattle  is the primitive stock known; and it has been shown in former chapters that  they have assumed different colours in different countries. Thus the horses  which have run wild in South America are generally brownish-bay, and in the  East dun-coloured; their heads have become larger and coarser, and this may be  due to reversion. No careful description has been given of the feral goat.  Dogs which have run wild in various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a  uniform character; but they are probably descended from several domestic  races, and aboriginally from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in  Europe and La Plata, are regularly striped; in some cases they have grown to  an unusually large size, but do not differ from the domestic animal in any  other character. When variously-coloured tame rabbits are turned out in  Europe, they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild animal; there can  be no doubt that this does really occur, but we should remember that oddly-  coloured and conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of prey and  from being easily shot; this at least was the opinion of a gentleman who tried  to stock his woods with a nearly white variety; if thus destroyed, they would  be supplanted by, instead of being transformed into, the common rabbit. We  have seen that the feral rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto Santo,  have assumed new colours and other new characters. The best known case of  reversion, and that on which the widely spread belief in its universality  apparently rests, is that of pigs. These animals have run wild in the West  Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands, and have everywhere acquired  the dark colour, the thick bristles, and great tusks of the wild boar; and the  young have reacquired longitudinal stripes. But even in the case of the pig,  Roulin describes the half-wild animals in different parts of South America as  differing in several respects. In Louisiana the pig (13/12. Dureau de la Malle  'Comptes Rendus' tome 41 1855 page 807. From the statements above given, the  author concludes that the wild pigs of Louisiana are not descended from the  European Sus scrofa.) has run wild, and is said to differ a little in form,  and much in colour, from the domestic animal, yet does not closely resemble  the wild boar of Europe. With pigeons and fowls (13/13. Capt. W. Allen, in his  'Expedition to the Niger' states that fowls have run wild on the island of  Annobon, and have become modified in form and voice. The account is so meagre  and vague that it did not appear to me worth copying; but I now find that  Dureau de la Malle ('Comptes Rendus' tome 41 1855 page 690) advances this as a  good instance of reversion to the primitive stock, and as confirmatory of a  still more vague statement in classical times by Varro.), it is not known what  variety was first turned out, nor what character the feral birds have assumed.  The guinea-fowl in the West Indies, when feral, seems to vary more than in the  domesticated state.    With respect to plants run wild, Dr. Hooker (13/14. 'Flora of Australia' 1859  Introduction page 9.) has strongly insisted on what slight evidence the common  belief in their reversion to a primitive state rests. Godron (13/15. 'De  l'Espece' tome 2 pages 54, 58, 60.) describes wild turnips, carrots, and  celery; but these plants in their cultivated state hardly differ from their  wild prototypes, except in the succulency and enlargement of certain parts,--  characters which would certainly be lost by plants growing in poor soil and  struggling with other plants. No cultivated plant has run wild on so enormous  a scale as the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) in La Plata. Every botanist who  has seen it growing there, in vast beds, as high as a horse's back, has been  struck with its peculiar appearance; but whether it differs in any important  point from the cultivated Spanish form, which is said not to be prickly like  its American descendant, or whether it differs from the wild Mediterranean  species, which is said not to be social (though this may be due merely to the  nature of the conditions), I do not know.]    REVERSION TO CHARACTERS DERIVED FROM A CROSS, IN THE CASE OF SUB-VARIETIES,  RACES, AND SPECIES.    When an individual having some recognisable peculiarity unites with another of  the same sub-variety, not having the peculiarity in question, it often  reappears in the descendants after an interval of several generations. Every  one must have noticed, or heard from old people of children closely resembling  in appearance or mental disposition, or in so small and complex a character as  expression, one of their grandparents, or some more distant collateral  relation. Very many anomalies of structure and diseases (13/16. Mr. Sedgwick  gives many instances in the 'British and Foreign Med.-Chirurg. Review' April  and July 1863 pages 448, 188.) of which instances have been given in the last  chapter, have come into a family from one parent, and have reappeared in the  progeny after passing over two or three generations. The following case has  been communicated to me on good authority, and may, I believe, be fully  trusted: a pointer-bitch produced seven puppies; four were marked with blue  and white, which is so unusual a colour with pointers that she was thought to  have played false with one of the greyhounds, and the whole litter was  condemned; but the gamekeeper was permitted to save one as a curiosity. Two  years afterwards a friend of the owner saw the young dog, and declared that he  was the image of his old pointer-bitch Sappho, the only blue and white pointer  of pure descent which he had ever seen. This led to close inquiry, and it was  proved that he was the great-great-grandson of Sappho; so that, according to  the common expression, he had only 1/16th of her blood in his veins. I may  give one other instance, on the authority of Mr. R. Walker, a large cattle-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#3)"],[1," eyepieces is a single double-convex lens. With  such a lens the magnifying power of the telescope is measured by the  ratio of the focal length of the objective to that of the eye lens.  Suppose the first is sixty inches and the latter half an inch; then the  magnifying power will be a hundred and twenty diameters--i. e., the disk  of a planet, for instance, will be enlarged a hundred and twenty times  along each diameter, and its area will be enlarged the square of a  hundred and twenty, or fourteen thousand four hundred times. But in  reckoning magnifying power, diameter, not area, is always considered.  For practical use an eyepiece composed of an ordinary single lens is  seldom advantageous, because good definition can only be obtained in the  center of the field. Lenses made according to special formulae, however,  and called solid eyepieces, give excellent results, and for high powers  are often to be preferred to any other. The eyepieces usually furnished  with telescopes are, in their essential principles, compound  microscopes, and they are of two descriptions, \"positive\" and  \"negative.\" The former generally goes under the name of its inventor,  Ramsden, and the latter is named after great Dutch astronomer, Huygens.  The Huygens eyepiece consists of two plano-convex lenses whose focal  lengths are in the ratio of three to one. The smaller lens is placed  next to the eye. Both lenses have their convex surfaces toward the  object glass, and their distance apart is equal to half the sum of their  focal lengths. In this kind of eyepiece the image is formed between the  two lenses, and if the work is properly done such an eyepiece is  achromatic. It is therefore generally preferred for mere seeing  purposes. In the Ramsden eyepiece two plano-convex lenses are also used,  but they are of equal focal length, are placed at a distance apart equal  to two thirds of the focal length of either, and have their convex sides  facing one another. With such an eyepiece the image viewed is beyond the  farther or field lens instead of between the two lenses, and as this  fact renders it easier to adjust wires or lines for measuring purposes  in the focus of the eyepiece, the Ramsden construction is used when a  micrometer is to be employed. In order to ascertain the magnifying power  which an eyepiece gives when applied to a telescope it is necessary to  know the equivalent, or combined, focal length of the two lenses. Two  simple rules, easily remembered, supply the means of ascertaining this.  The equivalent focal length of a negative or Huygens eyepiece is equal  to half the focal length of the larger or field lens. The equivalent  focal length of a positive or Ramsden eyepiece is equal to three fourths  of the focal length of either of the lenses. Having ascertained the  equivalent focal length of the eyepiece, it is only necessary to divide  it into the focal length of the object glass (or mirror) in order to  know the magnifying power of your telescope when that particular  eyepiece is in use.    [Illustration: NEGATIVE EYEPIECE.]    [Illustration: POSITIVE EYEPIECE.]    A first-class object glass (or mirror) will bear a magnifying power of  one hundred to the inch of aperture when the air is in good  condition--that is, if you are looking at stars. If you are viewing the  moon, or a planet, better results will always be obtained with lower  powers--say fifty to the inch at the most. And under ordinary  atmospheric conditions a power of from fifty to seventy-five to the inch  is far better for stars than a higher power. With a five-inch telescope  that would mean from two hundred and fifty to three hundred and  seventy-five diameters, and such powers should only be applied for the  sake of separating very close double stars. As a general rule, the  lowest power that will distinctly show what you desire to see gives the  best results. The experienced observer never uses as high powers as the  beginner does. The number of eyepieces purchased with a telescope should  never be less than three--a very low power--say ten to the inch; a very  high power, seventy-five or one hundred to the inch, for occasional use;  and a medium power--say forty to the inch--for general use. If you can  afford it, get a full battery of eyepieces--six or eight, or a  dozen--for experience shows that different objects require different  powers in order to be best seen, and, moreover, a slight change of power  is frequently a great relief to the eye.    There is one other thing of great importance to be considered in  purchasing a telescope--the mounting. If your glass is not well mounted  on a steady and easily managed stand, you might better have spent your  money for something more useful. I have endured hours of torment while  trying to see stars through a telescope that was shivering in the wind  and dancing to every motion of the bystanders, to say nothing of the  wriggling contortions caused by the application of my own fingers to the  focusing screw. The best of all stands is a solid iron pillar firmly  fastened into a brick or stone pier, sunk at least four feet in the  ground, and surmounted by a well-made equatorial bearing whose polar  axis has been carefully placed in the meridian. It can be readily  protected from the weather by means of a wooden hood or a rubber sheet,  while the tube of the telescope may be kept indoors, being carried out  and placed on its bearing only when observations are to be made. With  such a mounting you can laugh at the observatories with their cumbersome  domes, for the best of all observatories is the open air. But if you  dislike the labor of carrying and adjusting the tube every time it is  used, and are both fond of and able to procure luxuries, then, after  all, perhaps, you had better have the observatory, dome, draughts and  all.    The next best thing in the way of a mounting is a portable tripod stand.  This may be furnished either with an equatorial bearing for the  telescope, or an altazimuth arrangement which permits both up-and-down  and horizontal motions. The latter is cheaper than the equatorial and  proportionately inferior in usefulness and convenience. The essential  principle of the equatorial bearing is motion about two axes placed at  right angles to one another. When the polar axis is in the meridian, and  inclined at an angle equal to the latitude of the place, the telescope  can be moved about the two axes in such a way as to point to any quarter  of the sky, and the motion of a star, arising from the earthy rotation,  can be followed hour after hour without disturbing the instrument. When  thus mounted, the telescope may be driven by clockwork, or by hand with  the aid of a screw geared to a handle carrying a universal joint.    And now for testing the telescope. It has already been remarked that the  excellence of a telescope depends upon the perfection of the image  formed at the focus of the objective. In what follows I have only a  refractor in mind, although the same principles would apply to a  reflector. With a little practice anybody who has a correct eye can form  a fair judgment of the excellence of a telescopic image. Suppose we have  our telescope steadily mounted out of doors (if you value your peace of  mind you will not try to use a telescope pointed out of a window,  especially in winter), and suppose we begin our observations with the  pole star, employing a magnifying power of sixty or seventy to the inch.  Our first object is to see if the optician has given us a good glass. If  the air is not reasonably steady we had better postpone our experiment  to another night, because we shall find that the star as seen in the  telescope flickers and \"boils,\" and behaves in so extraordinary a  fashion that there is no more definition in the image than there is  steadiness in a bluebottle buzzing on a window pane. But if the night is  a fine one the star image will be quiescent, and then we may note the  following particulars: The real image is a minute bright disk, about one  second of arc in diameter if we are using a four-and-a-half or five-inch  telescope, and surrounded by one very thin ring of light, and the  fragments, so to speak, of one or possibly two similar rings a little  farther from the disk, and visible, perhaps, only by glimpses. These  \"diffraction rings\" arise from the undulatory nature of light, and their  distance apart as well as the diameter of the central disk depend upon  the length of the waves of light. If the telescope is a really good one,  and both object glass and eyepiece are properly adjusted, the disk will  be perfectly round, slightly softer at the edge, but otherwise equally  bright throughout; and the ring or rings surrounding it will be exactly  concentric, and not brighter on one side than on another. Even if our  telescope were only two inches or two inches and a half in aperture we  should at once notice a little bluish star, the mere ghost of a star in  a small telescope, hovering near the polar star. It is the celebrated  \"companion,\" but we shall see it again when we have more time to study  it. Now let us put the star out of focus by turning the focusing screw.  Suppose we turn it in such a way that the eyepiece moves slightly  outside the focus, or away from the object glass. Very beautiful  phenomena immediately begin to make their appearance. A slight motion  outward causes the little disk to expand perceptibly, and just as this  expansion commences, a bright-red point appears at the precise center of  the disk. But, the outward motion continuing, this red center  disappears, and is replaced by a blue center, which gradually expands  into a sort of flare over the middle of the disk. The disk itself has in  the mean time enlarged into a series of concentric bright rings,  graduated in luminosity with beautiful precision from center toward  circumference. The outermost ring is considerably brighter, however,  than it "]]]
