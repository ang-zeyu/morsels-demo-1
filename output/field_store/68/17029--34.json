It is in the third plate of the \"Rake's  Progress\" the woman alluded to is introduced. A small critic might here  find a fit subject for vituperation, and loudly condemn Cunningham as a  writer who was too idle to examine the works he was describing; pouncing  on his minute errors, and forgetting the totality of his generous  labors. Much of this spirit infests literature; and merges the kindly  exposition of error into the bitterness of personal attack. The  fallibility of human nature should teach us charity, and our own faults  lead us to \"more gently scan our brother man,\"--a thing too often  unthought of by those who are nothing if not critical, and as frequently  nothing when they are. The painter was descended from a Westmoreland  family. Sprung from an industrious race of self-helping yeomen, whose  hardy toil brought them health and contentment, Hogarth had an early  advantage, derived from his father's love of letters, which eventually  drew him away from field and wood to the great London mart. Like  thousands of others, he was unsuccessful. Fortunately, in this instance,  his want of success in literature stimulated the strong mind of his son  to seek occupation of more certain profit; and those who feel interest  in the whereabouts of celebrated men, may think upon the days when  William Hogarth wrought in silver, as the apprentice of Ellis Gamble, in  Cranbourne Street, and speculate upon the change of circumstances,  wrought by his own exertions, when, as a great painter, in after time,  he occupied the house, now known as the Sabloniere Hotel, in Leicester  Square.    Hogarth's character of mind, evidenced in his works and proved by his  biography, is so perfectly honest, open, home-bred English, that we  claim him with pride--as belonging exclusively to England. His  originality is of English growth; his satire broad, bold, fair-play  English. He was no screened assassin of character, either with pen or  pencil; no journalist's hack to stab in secret--concealing his name, or  assuming a forged one; no masked caricaturist, responsible to none. His  philosophy was of the straightforward, clear-sighted English school; his  theories--stern, simple, and unadorned--thoroughly English; his  determination--proved in his love as well as in his hate--quite English;  there is a firmness of purpose, a rough dignity, a John-Bull look in his  broad intelligent face; the very fur round his cap must have been plain  English rabbit-skin! No matter what \"schools\" were in fashion, Hogarth  created and followed his own; no matter what was done, or said, or  written, Hogarth maintained his opinion unflinchingly; he was not to be  moved or removed from his resolve. His mind was vigorous and inflexible,  and withal, keen and acute; and though the delicacy of his taste in this  more refined age may be matter of question, there can be no doubt as to  his integrity and uprightness of purpose--in his determination to  denounce vice, and by that means cherish virtue.    Professor Leslie, in his eloquent and valuable Lectures on Painting,  delivered in the spring of the present year to the students of the Royal  Academy, has nobly vindicated Hogarth as an artist and a man, in words  that all who heard will long remember. \"Hogarth,\" he said, \"it is true,  is often gross; but it must be remembered that he painted in a less  fastidious age than ours, and that his great object was to expose vice.  _Debauchery is always made by him detestable, never attractive._\"  Charles Lamb, one of the best of his commentators, who has viewed his  labors in a kindred spirit, speaking of one of his most elaborate and  varied works, the \"Election Entertainment,\" asks, \"What is the result  left on the mind? Is it an impression of the vileness and worthlessness  of our species? Or is not the general feeling which remains after the  individual faces have ceased to act sensibly on the mind, _a kindly one  in favor of the species_?\" Leslie speaks of his \"high species of humor,  pregnant with moral meanings,\" and no happier choice of phrase could  characterize his many works. Lamb, with true discrimination, says: \"All  laughter is not of a dangerous or soul-hardening tendency. There is the  petrifying sneer of a demon, which excludes and kills love, and there is  the cordial laughter of a man, which implies and cherishes it.\"    Hogarth's works are before us all; and are lessons as much for to-day as  they were for yesterday. We have no intention of scrutinizing their  merits or defects; we write only of the influence of a class of art such  as he brought courageously before the English public. Every one is  acquainted with the \"Rake's Progress,\" and can recall subject after  subject, story after story, which he illustrated. Comparatively few can  judge of him as a painter, but all can comprehend his moral  essays--brave as true!    His fearlessness and earnestness are above all price; independent, in  their high estate, of all praise. We would send \"Marriage a la Mode\"  into general circulation during the London season, where the market for  wives and husbands is presided over by interest rather than affection.  The matrimonial mart was as bravely exposed by the great satirist, as  the brutal and unmanly cock-fight, which at that period was permitted to  take place at the Cock-pit _Royal_, on the south side of St. James's  Park.    Society always needs such men as William Hogarth--true, stern men--to  grapple with and overthrow the vices which spring up--the very weeds  both of poverty and luxury,--the latter filled with the more bitter and  subtle poison. Calling to mind the period, we the more honor the great  artist's resolution; if the delicacy of our improved times is offended  by what may seem deformity upon his canvas, we must remember that we do  not shrink from _Hogarth's_ coarseness, but from the coarseness he  labored, by exposing, to expel. He painted what Smollett, and Fielding,  and Richardson wrote far more offensively; but he surpassed the  novelists both in truth and in intention. He painted without  sympathizing with his subjects, whom he lashed with unsparing bitterness  or humor. He never idealized a vice into a virtue--he never compromised  a fact, much less a principle.    He has, indeed, written fearful sermons on his canvas; sermons which,  however exaggerated they may seem to us in some of their painful details  of human sin and human misery, are yet so real, that we never doubt that  such things _were_, and _are_. No one can suspect Hogarth to have been  tainted by the vices he exposed. In this he has the advantage of the  novelists of his period: he gives vice no loophole of escape: it is  there in its hideous aspect, each step distinctly marked, each character  telling its own tale of warning, so that \"he who runs may read.\"    Whoever desires to trace the life of this English artist--to note him in  his apprenticeship--when he tamed as well as his rough nature would  permit, his hand to the delicate graving so cherished by his master,  Ellis Gamble; and when freed from his apprenticeship, he sought art  through the stirring scenes of life, saying quaintly enough, that  \"copying other men's works resembled pouring wine out of one vessel into  another; there was no increase of quantity, and the flavor of the  vintage was liable to evaporate;\"--whoever would study the great, as  well as the small, peculiarities of the painter who converted his  thumb-nail into a palette, and while transcribing characters and events  both rapidly and faithfully, complained of his \"constitutional  idleness:\"--whenever, we say, our readers feel desirous of revelling in  the biography of so diligent, so observing, so faithful, so brave a  spirit, we should send them to our old friend Allan Cunningham's most  interesting history of the man. Honest Allan had much in common with our  great national artist: though of different countries, they sprung from  the same race--sturdy yeomen; they were alike lovers of independence,  fighting for the best part of life manfully and faithfully enjoying the  noble scorn of wrong, and battling for the right from the cradle to the  grave. Self-educated--that is to say, educated by Nature, which gave and  nourished his high intellect and independent soul--Allan could  comprehend and appreciate the manly bearing and stern self-reliance of  the painter, whose best resources were in himself; thus the biography of  Hogarth is among the finest examples of its class which our language  supplies. Allan's sympathies were with his subject; and his knowledge  also came to his aid: for the poet was thoroughly imbued with a love of  art.    Allan Cunningham was a better disciplinarian, and less prone to look for  or care for enjoyment, than Hogarth; though we have many pleasant  memories how he truly relished both music and conversation. But there  was more sentiment in the Scottish poet than in the English painter; and  the deep dark eyes of the Scot had more of fervor and less of sarcasm in  their brightness. We repeat, Allan, of all writers, could thoroughly  appreciate Hogarth; and his biography is written _con amore_. He says  that \"all who love the dramatic representations of actual life,--all who  have hearts to be gladdened by humor,--all who are pleased with  judicious and well-directed satire,--all who are charmed with the  ludicrous looks of popular folly, and all who can be moved with the  pathos of human suffering, are admirers of Hogarth.\" But to our  thinking; Hogarth had a calling even more elevated than the Scottish  poet has given him in this eloquent summing-up of his attributes; \"he is  one of our greatest teachers--a TEACHER to whom is due the _highest_  possible honor; and the more we feel the importance of the teacher, the  more we value those who teach well. In grappling with folly and in  combating with crimes, he was compelled to reveal the nature of that he  proposed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1," the German frontier, their names ran  as follows: Barchon, Evegnee, Fleron, Chaudfontaine, Embourg, Boncelles,  Flemalle, Hollogne, Loncin, Lantin, Liers, and Pontisse. The armaments  of the forts consisted of 6-inch and 4.7-inch guns, with 8-inch mortars  and quick firers. They were in the relative number of two, four, two and  four for the major forts, and two, two, one and three for the minor  _fortins_, as such were termed. The grand total was estimated at 400  pieces. In their confined underground quarters the garrisons, even of  the major forts, did not exceed eighty men from the engineer, artillery  and infantry branches of the service. Between Fort Pontisse and the  Dutch frontier was less than six miles.    [Illustration: This bridge over the Meuse at Liege was blown up by the  Belgians to delay the German advance. The German army crossed on pontoon  bridges.]    It was through this otherwise undefended gap that Von Kluck purposed to  advance his German army after the presumed immediate fall of Liege, to  that end having seized the Meuse crossing at Vise. The railway line to  Aix-la-Chapelle was dominated by Fort Fleron, while the minor Forts  Chaudfontaine and Embourg, to the south, commanded the trunk line by way  of Liege into Belgium. On the plateau, above Liege, Fort Loncin held  the railway junction of Ans and the lines running from Liege north and  west. Finally, the forts were not constructed on a geometric circle, but  in such manner that the fire of any two was calculated to hold an enemy  at bay should a third between them fall. This was probably an accurate  theory before German guns of an unimagined caliber and range were  brought into action.    In command of the Belgian forts at Liege was General Leman. He had  served under Brialmont, and was pronounced a serious and efficient  officer. He was a zealous military student, physically extremely active,  and constantly on the watch for any relaxation of discipline. These  qualities enabled him to grasp at the outset the weakness of his  position.    If the Germans believed the refusal to grant a free passage for their  armies through Belgium to be little more than a diplomatic protest, it  would seem the Belgian Government was equally mistaken in doubting the  Germans would force a way through an international treaty of Belgian  neutrality. Consequently, the German crossing of the frontier discovered  Belgium with her mobilization but half complete, mainly on a line for  the defense of Brussels and Antwerp. It had been estimated by Brialmont  that 75,000 men of all arms were necessary for the defense of Liege on a  war footing, probably 35,000 was the total force hastily gathered in the  emergency to withstand the German assault on the fortifications. It  included the Civic Guard.    General Leman realized, therefore, that, without a supporting field  army, it would be impossible for him to hold the German hosts before  Liege for more than a few days--a week at most.    But he hoped within such time the French or British would march to his  relief. Thus his chief concern was for the forts protecting the railway  leading from Namur down the Meuse Valley into Liege--the line of a  French or British advance.    On the afternoon of August 4, 1914, German patrols appeared on the left  bank of the Meuse, approaching from Vise. They were also observed by the  sentries on Forts Barchon, Evegnee and Fleron. German infantry and  artillery presently came into view with the unmistakable object of  beginning the attack on those forts. The forts fired a few shots by way  of a challenge. As evening fell the woods began to echo with the roar of  artillery. Later, Forts Fleron, Chaudfontaine and Embourg were added to  the German bombardment. The Germans used long range field pieces with  powerful explosive shells. The fire proved to be remarkably accurate. As  their shells exploded on the cupolas and platforms of the forts, the  garrisons in their confined citadels began to experience that inferno of  vibrations which subsequently deprived them of the incentive to eat or  sleep. The Belgians replied vigorously, but owing to the broken nature  of the country, and the forethought with which the Germans took  advantage of every form of gun cover, apparently little execution was  dealt upon the enemy. However, the Belgians claimed to have silenced two  of the German pieces.    In the darkness of this historic night of August 4, 1914, the flames of  the fortress guns pierced the immediate night with vivid streaks. Their  searchlights swept in broad streams the wooded slopes opposite. The  cannonade resounded over Liege, as if with constant peals of thunder. In  the city civilians sought the shelter of their cellars, but few of the  German shells escaped their range upon the forts to disturb them.    This exchange of artillery went on until near daybreak of August 5,  1914, when infantry fire from the woods to the right of Fort Embourg  apprised the defenders that the Germans were advancing to the attack.  The Germans came on in their customary massed formation. The prevalent  opinion that in German tactics such action was employed to hearten the  individual soldier, was denied by their General Staff. In their opinion  an advantage was thus gained by the concentration of rifle fire. Belgian  infantry withstood the assault, and counterattacked. When dawn broke, a  general engagement was in progress. About eight o'clock the Germans were  compelled to withdraw.    [Illustration: Beginning of German Invasion of Belgium.]    The first engagement of the war was won by the Belgians. It was reported  that the Belgian fire had swept the Germans down in thousands, but this  was denied by German authorities. Up to this time the German forces  before Liege were chiefly Von Kluck's vanguard under Von Emmich, his  second line of advance, and detachments of Von Buelow's army. On the  Belgian side no attempt was made to follow up the advantage. The reason  given is that the Germans were seen to be in strong cavalry force, an  arm lost totally in the military complement of Liege. The German losses  were undoubtedly severe, especially in front of Fort Barchon. This was  one of the major forts, triangular in shape, and surrounded by a ditch  and barbed wire entanglements. The armament of these major forts had  recently been reenforced by night, secretly, with guns of heavier  caliber from Antwerp. As they outmatched the German field pieces of the  first attack, presumably the German Intelligence Department had failed  in news of them. An armistice requested by the Germans to gather in the  wounded and bury the dead was refused. Thereupon the artillery duel  recommenced.    A hot and oppressive day disclosed woods rent and scarred, standing  wheat fields shell-plowed and trampled, and farm houses set ablaze. The  bringing of the Belgian wounded into Liege apprised the citizens that  their side had also suffered considerably. Meanwhile, the Germans were  reenforced by the Tenth Hanoverian Army Corps, from command of which  General von Emmich had been detached to lead Von Kluck's vanguard, also  artillery with 8.4-inch howitzers.    The bombardment on this 5th day of August, 1914, now stretched from Vise  around the Meuse right bank half circle of forts to embrace Pontisse and  Boncelles at its extremities. In a few hours infantry attack began  again. The Germans advanced in masses by short rushes, dropping to fire  rifle volleys, and then onward with unflinching determination. The  forts, wreathed in smoke, blazed shells among them; their machine guns  spraying streams of bullets. The Germans were repulsed and compelled to  retire, but only to re-form for a fresh assault. Both Belgian and German  aeroplanes flew overhead to signal their respective gunners. A Zeppelin  was observed, but did not come within range of Belgian fire. The  Belgians claim to have shot down one German aeroplane, and another is  said to have been brought to earth by flying within range of its own  artillery.    During the morning of August 5, Fort Fleron was put out of action by  shell destruction of its cupola-hoisting machinery. This proved a weak  point in Brialmont's fortress plan. It was presently discovered that the  fire of the supporting forts Evegnee and Chaudfontaine could not command  the lines forming the apex of their triangle. Further, since the Belgian  infantry was not in sufficient force to hold the lines between the  forts, a railway into Liege fell to the enemy. The fighting here was of  such a desperate nature, that General Leman hastened to reenforce with  all his reserve.    This battle went on during the afternoon and night of August 5, into the  morning of August 6, 1914. But the fall of Fort Fleron began to tell in  favor of the Germans. Belgian resistance perforce weakened. The  ceaseless pounding of the German 8.4-inch howitzers smashed the inner  concrete and stone protective armor of the forts, as if of little more  avail than cardboard. At intervals on August 6, Forts Chaudfontaine,  Evegnee and Barchon fell under the terrific hail of German shells. A way  was now opened into the city, though, for the most part, still contested  by Belgian infantry. A party of German hussars availed themselves of  some unguarded path to make a daring but ineffectual dash to capture  General Leman and his staff.    General Leman was consulting with his officers at military headquarters,  on August 6, 1914, when they were startled by shouts outside. He rushed  forth into a crowd of citizens to encounter eight men in German uniform.  General Leman cried for a revolver to defend himself, but another  officer, fearing the Germans had entered the city in force, lifted him  up over a foundry wall. Both Leman and the officer made their escape by  way of an adjacent house. Belgian Civic Guards hastening to the scene  dispatched an officer and two men of the German raiders. The rest of the  party are"]]]
