In the center, in the warmest part of the  hive, are the royal nurseries, the domain set apart for the queen and  her attendants; here also are about 16,000 cells wherein the eggs  repose, 15 or 16,000 chambers occupied by the youthful bees, and 40,000  rooms filled with infants in their cradles, cared for by thousands of  nurses. And, last of all, in the most secret and private quarters, are  the three, four, six or twelve sealed palaces, vast in size compared  with the others, where the growing princesses lie who await their hour;  wrapped in a kind of shroud, all of them motionless and pale, and fed in  the darkness.      The appointed day arrives, the one that has been chosen by the \"spirit  of the hive\"; and a certain part of the population will at once sally  forth. In the sleeping city there remain the males, the very young bees  that look after the brood-cells, and some thousands of workers who go on  gathering honey, guarding the treasure, and keeping up the moral  atmosphere of the hive. For it must be understood that each hive has its  own moral code; some are admirable in every respect, while others have  fallen away sadly from the paths of virtue. A careless bee-keeper will  often spoil his people, and cause them to lose respect for the property  of others, whereby they will become a danger to all the hives around.  They will give up the hundreds of visits to neighboring flowers that are  necessary in order to form one drop of honey, and will prefer to force  their way into other hives, that are too weak for selfdefense, and to  rob these of the fruit of their labors; and it is very difficult to  bring back to the paths of duty a hive that shall have become so  depraved.      All things go to prove that it is not the queen, but the \"spirit of the  hive,\" that fixes on the hour for the swarm. This queen of ours, like  many a leader among men, is herself compelled to obey commands that are  far more important, and far more secret, than those which she gives to  her subjects. At break of dawn, or perhaps a night or two before, the  word will be given; and scarcely has the sun drunk in the first drops of  dew when a most unusual stir may be noticed inside and all around the  buzzing hive. Sometimes, too, for day after day before the actual  swarming takes place, one will find a curious excitement, for which  there would seem no cause, that suddenly appears, and as suddenly  vanishes, in the golden, gleaming throng. One asks oneself, has a cloud  that we cannot see crept across the sky that the bees are watching; or  is it their mere sorrow at the thought of leaving? Has a council of bees  been summoned to consider whether they really must go? Of all this we  know nothing; we do know that the \"spirit of the hive\" has no difficulty  in letting its message be known to the multitude. Certain as it may seem  that the bees are able to communicate with each other, we cannot tell  whether this is done in our human fashion. It is possible that they  themselves do not hear their own song, the murmur that comes to us  heavily laden with perfume of honey, the joyous whisper of fairest  summer days that the bee-keeper loves so well, the festival song of  labor that rises and falls around the hive, and that might almost be the  chant of the eager flowers, the voice of the white carnation, the  marjoram, and the thyme.    Certain sounds that the bees put forth, however, can be readily  understood by us, sounds that convey anger, sorrow, rejoicing or  threats. They have their songs of abundance, when the harvest is  plentiful, their psalms of grief and the chorus they chant to the queen;  and at the time when she is being chosen the young princesses will send  forth long and mysterious warcries.... It is quite possible that the  sounds we ourselves make do not reach the bees; in any event these  sounds do not seem in the least to disturb them, but are regarded by the  bees perhaps as not intended for them, not in their world, and anyhow of  no interest. In the same way perhaps we too only hear a very small part  of the sounds that the bees produce, and there may be many of which we  are ignorant. We soon shall be shown how quickly they contrive to  understand each other, and how each one is told precisely the right  thing to do, when, for instance, that great honey-thief, the dreadful  moth that bears a death's head on its back, forces its way into the  hive, humming its own strange song. The news travels quickly from group  to group; and from the guards on the threshold to the workers on the  most distant combs, the whole population of the hive becomes suddenly  alert and eager, and trembles with fear.      For a long time it was thought that when these clever bees, usually so  prudent and well-advised, left the treasures of their kingdom and sought  a future that was so full of uncertainty, they were obeying some foolish  impulse, some suggestion that had no especial meaning. It is our habit,  when we consider the bees, to say that all that we do not as yet  understand is just due to fate, that it happens because it had to  happen. But now that we have discovered two or three of the secrets of  the hive, we have learned why it is that the bees swarm; the reason  being merely that the generation at present in the hive has thought it  its duty to sacrifice itself on behalf of the generation that is to  come.    The fact that this is the case can easily be proved. If the bee-keeper  chooses to destroy the young queens in their cells, to enlarge the  store-houses and dormitories in the hive, all the restlessness,  confusion, the stir and the worry, would at once disappear. The bees  would immediately take up their work again and revisit the flowers; the  old queen, having no one to fill her place, would give up her great  desire for the light of the sun, and decide to remain where she was. All  her doubts as to the future being now set at rest, she would peacefully  continue her labors, which consist in the laying of two or three  thousand eggs a day, as she passes from cell to cell, omitting none, and  never pausing to rest.      This particular hive, however, that we are now watching, has not been  interfered with by man; the bees have been left to do what seemed right  to them. On the appointed day then, the beautiful day, whose dawn, still  moist with the dew, comes nearer and nearer beneath the trees,  approaching with radiant and glowing steps, the bees all become  impatient, and feverishly restless. Over the whole surface of the golden  corridors that divide the walls of the hive, the workers are busily  making preparations for the journey. Each one will first of all provide  herself with honey sufficient for five or six days. From this honey  that they carry within them they will distil the wax needed to build the  new home. They will take with them also some kind of solid substance  with which they will afterwards block up all the holes, strengthen weak  places, varnish the walls and shut out the light; for the bees love to  work in complete darkness, guiding themselves with their wonderful eyes,  or perhaps with their antennae, or feelers, which very possibly possess  some sense, unknown to us, that enables them to triumph over the  darkness.      This is the most dangerous day in the life of the bee; it is full of the  most dreadful possibilities; and the bees are well aware of it. Thinking  of nothing now but their mighty adventure, they will have no time to  visit the gardens and meadows; and to-morrow, and after to-morrow, it  may rain, or there may be wind; their wings may be frozen and the  flowers refuse to open. They would soon die of hunger; no one would come  to help them, and they would seek help from none. For one city knows not  the other, and assistance never is given. And even if the bee-keeper  place the new hive by the side of the old one, the queen and her cluster  of bees would not dream of returning to the safety and wealth of the  home they had left, no matter what hardships they might have to endure;  and all, one by one, and down to the last of them, would perish of  hunger and cold around their unhappy queen rather than go back to the  hive where they were born.      This is a thing, some people might say, that men would not do; it is a  proof that the bee cannot have much intelligence. Is this so certain?  Other creatures may have an intelligence that is different from ours,  and produces different results; and yet it does not follow that they are  inferior to us. Are we so readily able to understand of what the people  are thinking whom we see, perhaps, talking behind a closed window or  moving about in the street? Or let us suppose that an inhabitant of  Venus or Mars were to look down from the top of a mountain, and watch  us, who to him would seem mere little black specks, as we come and go in  the streets and squares of our towns. Would the mere sight of our  movements, our buildings, machines and canals, give him any very real  idea of ourselves? All he could do, like ourselves as we gaze at the  hive, would be to take note of one or two facts that seem very  extraordinary. And from these facts he would jump at conclusions that  would be just as uncertain as those that it pleases us to form  concerning the bee.    \"What are they aiming at, what are they trying for?\" he would wonder,  after years and years of patient watching. \"I can see nothing that seems  to direct their actions. The little things that one day they collect and  build up, the next they destroy and scatter. In a great many cases their  conduct is quite extraordinary. There are some men, for instance, who  seem to do no work and hardly to stir from their place. They can be told  from the others by their glossier coat, and also by their being  generally fatter. They live in buildings ten or twenty times bigger than  those of the workers, very much richer, and full of little ingenious  contrivances.
