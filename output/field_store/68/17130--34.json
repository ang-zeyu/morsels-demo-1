Nor is the Indian girl, with her full, lithe figure,  long, glossy hair, quick and mischievous eyes, who walks erect as a  grenadier beneath her heavy water-jar, and salutes you in a musical,  impudent voice, as you pass--nor is the Indian girl to be overlooked in  the novel contrasts which the \"bello sexo\" affords in this glorious land  of the sun.\"    Some of the pleasantest incidents related in the book are those which  befell the author in his dealings with the Indians, in prosecuting his  archaeological investigations. These Indians are all passionate admirers  of the United States, and of the \"hijos de Washington\"--the sons of  Washington. Mr. Squier was waited upon officially by the authorities of  several of the Indian pueblos or towns, and among them by the  municipality of the Indian pueblo of Subtiaba, headed by a great friend  of our author, Don Simon Roque, first alcalde, who presented him with an  address in the aboriginal language, of which the following is a literal  translation:         \"SIR: The municipality of the Pueblo of Subtiaba, of which       we are members, entertain the highest enthusiasm in view of       the relations which your arrival induces us to believe will       speedily be established between Nicaragua and the United       States, the greatest and most glorious republic beneath the       sun. We rejoice in the depths of our hearts that a man like       yourself has been chosen to convey to us the assurances of       future prosperity, in the name of the sons of Washington;       and we trust in the Almighty, that the flag of the United       States may soon become the shield of Nicaragua on land and       sea. Convey our sincerest thanks for their sympathy to the       great people which you represent, and give to your generous       government the assurances of that deep gratitude which we       feel but cannot express. We beg of you, sir, to accept this       humble evidence of the cordial sentiments which we entertain       both for you, your countrymen, and your Government, and       which are equally shared by the people which we represent                     JOSE DE LA CRUZ GARCIAS,      (Signed)     SIMON ROQUE,                   FRANCISCO LUIS AUTAN.\"    Our author returned the visit, and gives us the following account of his  reception:         \"The reader may be assured that I did not forget my promise       to the municipality of Subtiaba. A day was shortly       afterwards fixed for my visit, and I was received with great       ceremony at the cabildo or council chamber, where I found       collected all the old men who could assist me in forming a       vocabulary of the ancient language, which I had casually       expressed a desire to procure. It was with difficulty that       we could effect an entrance, for a half-holiday had been       given to the boys of all the schools, in honor of the       occasion, and they literally swarmed around the building. We       were finally ushered into an inner room, where the archives       of the municipality were preserved. Upon one side was a       large chest of heavy wood, with massive locks, which had       anciently been the strong box or treasury. A shadow fell       over Simon's animated face as he pointed it out to me, and       said that he could remember the time when it was filled with       \"duros,\" hard dollars, and when, at a single stroke of the       alarm bell, two thousand armed men could be gathered in the       plaza of Subtiaba. But those days were passed, and the       municipality now scarcely retained a shadow of its former       greatness. Under the crown it had earned the title 'leal y       fiel' (loyal and true), and in reward of its fidelity it had       received a grant of all the lands intervening between it and       the ocean, to hold them in perpetuity for the benefit of its       citizens. And Simon showed me the royal letters, signed \"Yo,       el Rey\" (I, the King), which the imperial emperor had       thought it not derogatory to their dignity to address to his       predecessors in office, and notwithstanding his ardent       republicanism, I thought Simon looked at them with something       of regret. I inquired for manuscripts which might throw some       light upon the early history of the country, but found only       musty records of no interest or value.    [Illustration: INDIAN HOUSE, SUBTIABA, NICARAGUA.]         \"My attempts to fill out the blank vocabulary with which I       was provided created a great deal of merriment. I enjoyed it       quite as much as any of them, for nothing could be more       amusing than the discussions between the old men in respect       to certain doubtful words and phrases. They sometimes quite       forgot my presence, and rated each other soundly as       ignoramuses, whereat Simon was greatly scandalized, and       threatened to put them all in the stocks as \"hombres sin       verguenza\" (men destitute of shame). 'Ah!' said he, 'these       old sinners give me more trouble than the young ones'--a       remark which created great mirth amongst the outsiders, and       especially amongst the young vagabonds who clung like       monkeys to the window bars. The group of swarthy, earnest       faces, gathered round the little table, upon which was       heaped a confused mass of ancient, time-stained papers,       would have furnished a study for a painter. It was quite       dark when I had concluded my inquiries, but I was not       permitted to leave without listening to a little poem, 'Una       Decima,' written by one of the school-masters, who read it       to me by the light of a huge wax candle, borrowed, I am       sure, from the church for the occasion. My modesty forbids       my attempting a translation, and so I compromise matters by       submitting the original:                    DECIMA.             Nicaragua, ve harta cuando           Cesara vuestro desvelo,           Ya levantara el vuelo           Hermoso, alegre, y triunfante;           Al mismo tiempo mirando           De este personage el porte,           Y mas sera cuando corte           Todos los gradeciamentos:           Diremos todos contentos           Viva el Gobierno del Norte.                                D. S.    \"As I mounted my horse, Don Simon led off with three cheers for 'El  Ministro del Norte,' and followed it with three more for 'El Amigo de  los Indios' (the friend of the Indians), all of which was afterwards  paraded by a dingy little Anglo-servile paper published in Costa Rica,  as evidence that I was tampering with the Indians, and exciting them to  undertake the utter destruction of the white population!\"          THE CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC.      _A History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac and the Wars of the North  American Tribes against the English Colonies after the Conquest of  Canada_, is the title of a new work to be published during the summer by  Francis Parkman, Jr. of Boston. Mr. Parkman, in introducing himself to  the public two or three years since, by a volume of sketches of western  travel, _The Oregon Trail_, betrayed not alone his strong natural fancy  for the wild life of the Indian, but a sensitive and sagacious eye for  character and scenery, and a style of nervous simplicity which in the  present undertaking have more perfect play in a much wider and worthier  sphere. The narrative proceeds clearly, and with simple grace. Many  figures, familiar by name, but by name only, pass sharply defined before  the reader's eye. The author has not lost in the lore of the historian  the feeling of the poet, but he does not compromise the dignity of  history, nor mistake its purpose, by indulging too much in luxuriance of  picturesque description. We congratulate Mr. Parkman that his tastes  have led him to the exploration of a subject in which we are all so  interested, a subject whose historical romance has never been before  attempted. The consultation of all the authorities, personal  observation, and the want of any unfair gilding of events or character,  fix the reader's faith in the severe integrity and justice of the  author's results. This history will materially mitigate the complaint  that American literature has so little honored the singular charm of the  aboriginal American race, and we cannot hesitate to predict for it a  position of authority to the student and of honor to the author, which  the works of few men so young in the literary career have attained.  Little estimate of its value, or of the value of any history, can be  formed from extracts, but the following will indicate the freshness and  poetic simplicity of the style, the author's exact eye for  characteristic life and scenery, and just appreciation of historical  truth and character.    Here is a glance at the life of the Iroquois:         \"The life of the Iroquois, though void of those multiplying       phases which vary the routine of civilized existence, was       one of sharp excitement and sudden contrast. The chase, the       war-path, the dance, the festival, the game of hazard, the       race of political ambition, all had their votaries. When the       assembled sachems had resolved on war against some foreign       tribe, and when, from their great council-house of bark, in       the Valley of Onondaga, their messengers had gone forth to       invite the warriors to arms, then from east to west, through       the farthest bounds of the confederacy, a thousand warlike       hearts caught up the summons with glad alacrity. With       fasting and praying, and consulting dreams and omens, with       invoking the war-god, and dancing the frantic war-dance, the       warriors sought to insure the triumph of their arms; and,       these strange rites concluded, they began their stealthy       progress, full of confidence, through the devious pathways       of the forest. For days and weeks,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33966"],[0,"Occurrence of the Garter Snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, in the Great Plains and (#3)"],[1,"from Douglas County,      Kansas) matches _ornata_ in olive coloration. These unusually      pale specimens of _parietalis_ differ from _ornata_ in not      having a continuous black edge along each side of dorsal      stripe; black pigment of this area is concentrated into rows      of spots alternating with those of lower series. From _T. s.      infernalis_, _ornata_ differs in having paired black spots      on the ventrals and in having more than three series of red      crescents on dorsolateral area of each side.    _Remarks._--The type of _ornata_ seems to have been lost, and the  available information concerning it is far from satisfactory. In the  original description, Baird listed three specimens, purportedly from  \"Indianola, Texas\" (J. H. Clark, 438), from the Rio Grande, Texas (J.  H. Clark, 768), and from near San Antonio, Texas (Dr. Kennerley, no  number). None of these three specimens could have been _ornata_ as  conceived of by us because all were collected outside the geographic  range of _ornata_. However, there was also included a plate with a  drawing of a specimen and a reference to an earlier paper (Baird and  Girard, 1853) in which a specimen obtained by Col. Graham \"Between  San Antonio and El Paso\" was described. Smith and Brown (1946:72) have  presented evidence that this specimen figured (rather than any of the  three specifically mentioned) served as a basis for the plate, and  they therefore considered it to be the holotype of _ornata_, even  though Baird referred this specimen to \"_Eutaenia parietalis_ Say\" in  the same paper (1859) in which the original description of _ornata_  was published. Cope (1900:1079) listed under _Eutaenia sirtalis  parietalis_ a specimen, U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, from El Paso,  obtained by Col. Graham, and referred to it as a type (without  specifying of what it was the type). Smith and Brown (_loc. cit._)  interpreted this statement by Cope as further evidence that the  specimen in question should be considered the type of _ornata_, and  they restricted the type locality, originally stated as \"between San  Antonio and El Paso\" to \"El Paso.\" Actually all valid records of the  species _sirtalis_ from the vicinity of the Rio Grande are from the El  Paso region or from farther north.    It is with some misgivings that we herewith accept the interpretation  proposed by Smith and Brown regarding the applicability of the name  _ornata_ and the designation by these authors of the now missing  specimen from the region of El Paso as the holotype of that form. The  evidence linking the name _ornata_ with the New Mexican subspecies is  tenuous; there is some doubt as to the provenance of U. S. Nat. Mus.  No. 960 (the supposed type), and even more doubt as to whether this  is the specimen depicted in the plate that formed part of the original  description.    Cope (1900:1076) recognized as a distinct subspecies, _Eutaenia  sirtalis dorsalis_, the same population that we recognize herein as  _T. s. ornata_, and Smith (1942:98) considered the name _dorsalis_ to  be a synonym of _T. s. parietalis_. However, it is almost certain  that both authors misapplied the name, since the type of Baird's  and Girard's (1853:31) _Eutainia dorsalis_ was obtained in Coahuila,  Mexico, between Monclova and the Rio Grande, far south of the known  range limits of _T. sirtalis_ in Texas. The description does not fit  _T. sirtalis_ and almost certainly pertains to another species.        _Specimens examined._--Univ. of Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.      (hereafter abbreviated to \"KU\") Nos. 5479 to 5497, from the      north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, Sierra County, New      Mexico, and 8592 and 8593 from near Las Lunas, Valencia      County, New Mexico; Univ. of New Mexico Mus. Nos. 571 and      572 (J. S. Findley) from 2 miles west and 1/4 mile north of      Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, and No. 4021 (E.      D. Flaherty) from 1 mile west and 1/2 mile south of Isleta,      Bernalillo County, New Mexico.      DESCRIPTION OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_    From most of the vast area occupied by _parietalis_, material has  not been available to us, and our concept of this subspecies is based  chiefly on specimens and living material from Kansas and northeastern  Colorado. A total of 520 live _parietalis_ has been examined from the  University of Kansas Natural History Reservation some 130 miles south  and a little east of the type locality in Nebraska. These probably  differ but little from typical specimens. The range of individual  variation in pattern is especially notable. In those from the  Reservation, the ground color varies from dull olive-brown to almost  jet black. The markings on the dorsolateral area vary in color, in  shade and in extent. These marks are chiefly confined to the skin  between the scales of rows three to nine. Although most typically  these marks are of some shade of red (hence the name \"red-sided garter  snake\"), they may be pale buff, or pale greenish yellow, or may even  have a bluish tint. In approximately ten per cent of the specimens  from the Reservation there is no red at all in the pattern, which  hence is similar to that of _T. s. sirtalis_ in the eastern United  States. Only a minority have all the dorsolateral marks red, and  in some of these specimens the marks higher on the sides are  progressively paler red, having a bleached out appearance. Most  typically the marks between rows three to six are some shade of red  while the smaller marks between rows six to nine are pale--yellowish,  greenish, or buffy. In some the pale area of the lateral stripe is in  varying degrees suffused with red, which may extend onto the edges of  the ventrals and even to the underside of the tail.    _T. s. parietalis_ may be diagnosed, on the basis of these snakes from  northeastern Kansas, as follows: Size medium large (length 23.5 to  34.5, or, exceptionally 43.5 inches in adult males; 32.5 to 46.0  inches in adult females), dorsolateral color olive to black.  Approximately every other scale of the third row is bordered above and  anteriorly by a crescent-shaped area of scarlet colored skin. Similar  crescent-shaped areas border the scales of the fourth and fifth rows  and often two adjacent crescents meet at the ends of an intervening  scale and fuse forming an H-shaped mark. Placed alternately with these  markings are similar but smaller crescent-shaped markings on the skin  of the upper half of the dorsolateral area on each side bordering  every other scale of the sixth, seventh and eighth rows. The crescents  of this upper series also may fuse to form series of H-shaped markings  alternating with those of the lower series. The dorsal stripe is  yellow with a faint dusky suffusion; it involves all of the middorsal  scale row and approximately the adjacent half of the row on either  side. The lateral stripe is faint, yellowish gray, chiefly on the  upper half of the second scale row, lower half of third, and the  intervening skin, and is often invaded or suffused by the red marks  of the dorsolateral area. The first scale row, adjacent corners of  the ventrals, and lower half of the second scale row are suffused  with dark pigment and appear dusky, but this area is often marked with  black, setting off the paler area of the lateral stripe. The ventrals  are dull, whitish, faintly suffused with yellowish, greenish or  bluish, each ventral having a black dot usually of semicircular shape  on its anterior margin near the anterolateral corner.      COMPARISON OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_ AND _T. S. FITCHI_    Like most widely ranging subspecies, _parietalis_ and _fitchi_ vary  geographically and local populations often are noticeably different  from typical material. It is possible that future revisors will  recognize additional subspecies, but in the variant populations  known to us the degree of differentiation is slight as compared,  for instance, with that in the subspecies of _Thamnophis elegans_.  Scalation is remarkably uniform in all the subspecies of _sirtalis_,  but coastal and northern populations tend to have fewer ventrals  and subcaudals than do their counterparts farther inland and farther  south. In their geographic variation the ventrals and subcaudals  follow clines, and do not in themselves warrant subspecific divisions.  Variation occurs chiefly in the color and pattern including the  intensity of dark pigmentation of the dorsolateral area, head, ventral  surface and lower edge of the lateral stripe; in extent, position and  shade of red or pale colored markings on the dorsolateral area; in  presence and extent of reddish suffusion on the head, in the region  of the lateral stripe, and on the ventral surface of the tail. Most  of these same characters vary within the subspecies _fitchi_, but the  range of variation is relatively minor. Fitch (_op. cit._:582-584)  described typical populations and also described briefly several small  series from British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and California which were  not entirely typical. Most frequent variation was in heavy reddish  suffusion on the sides of the head not found in typical _fitchi_. In  each local population of this subspecies the characters seem to be  remarkably uniform and stable.           *       *       *       *       *    Illustration: FIG. 2.
