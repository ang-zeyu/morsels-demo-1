At high water no land is visible for many miles to the north or south  of Venice, except in the form of small islands crowned with towers or  gleaming with villages: there is a channel, some three miles wide, between  the city and the mainland, and some mile and a half wide between it and  the sandy breakwater called the Lido, which divides the lagoon from the  Adriatic, but which is so low as hardly to disturb the impression of the  city's having been built in the midst of the ocean, although the secret of  its true position is partly, yet not painfully, betrayed by the clusters  of piles set to mark the deep-water channels, which undulate far away in  spotty chains like the studded backs of huge sea-snakes, and by the  quick glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker and dance  before the strong winds upon the unlifted level of the shallow sea. But  the scene is widely different at low tide. A fall of eighteen or twenty  inches is enough to show ground over the greater part of the lagoon; and  at the complete ebb the city is seen standing in the midst of a dark  plain of seaweed, of gloomy green, except only where the larger branches  of the Brenta and its associated streams converge towards the port of  the Lido. Through this salt and sombre plain the gondola and the  fishing-boat advance by tortuous channels, seldom more than four or five  feet deep, and often so choked with slime that the heavier keels furrow  the bottom till their crossing tracks are seen through the clear sea  water like the ruts upon a wintry road, and the oar leaves blue gashes  upon the ground at every stroke, or is entangled among the thick weed  that fringes the banks with the weight of its sullen waves, leaning to  and fro upon the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide. The scene is  often profoundly oppressive, even at this day, when every plot of higher  ground bears some fragment of fair building: but, in order to know what  it was once, let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the  windings of some unfrequented channel far into the midst of the  melancholy plain; let him remove, in his imagination, the brightness of  the great city that still extends itself in the distance, and the walls  and towers from the islands that are near; and so wait, until the bright  investiture and sweet warmth of the sunset are withdrawn from the  waters, and the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness  beneath the night, pathless, comfortless, infirm, lost in dark languor  and fearful silence, except where the salt runlets plash into the  tideless pools, or the sea-birds flit from their margins with a  questioning cry; and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the  horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently chosen by man for  his habitation. They little thought, who first drove the stakes into the  sand, and strewed the ocean reeds for their rest, that their children  were to be the princes of that ocean, and their palaces its pride; and  yet, in the great natural laws that rule that sorrowful wilderness, let  it be remembered what strange preparation had been made for the things  which no human imagination could have foretold, and how the whole  existence and fortune of the Venetian nation were anticipated or  compelled, by the setting of those bars and doors to the rivers and the  sea. Had deeper currents divided their islands, hostile navies would  again and again have reduced the rising city into servitude; had  stronger surges beaten their shores, all the richness and refinement of  the Venetian architecture must have been exchanged for the walls and  bulwarks of an ordinary sea-port. Had there been no tide, as in other  parts of the Mediterranean, the narrow canals of the city would have  become noisome, and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous. Had the  tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in its rise, the  water-access to the doors of the palaces would have been impossible:  even as it is, there is sometimes a little difficulty, at the ebb, in  landing without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps: and the  highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards, and overflow the entrance  halls. Eighteen inches more of difference between the level of the flood  and ebb would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace, at low water,  a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets, and the entire system of  water-carriage for the higher classes, in their easy and daily  intercourse, must have been done away with. The streets of the city  would have been widened, its network of canals filled up, and all the  peculiar character of the place and the people destroyed.    Sec. VII. The reader may perhaps have felt some pain in the contrast  between this faithful view of the site of the Venetian Throne, and the  romantic conception of it which we ordinarily form; but this pain, if he  have felt it, ought to be more than counterbalanced by the value of the  instance thus afforded to us at once of the inscrutableness and the  wisdom of the ways of God. If, two thousand years ago, we had been  permitted to watch the slow settling of the slime of those turbid rivers  into the polluted sea, and the gaining upon its deep and fresh waters of  the lifeless, impassable, unvoyageable plain, how little could we have  understood the purpose with which those islands were shaped out of the  void, and the torpid waters enclosed with their desolate walls of sand!  How little could we have known, any more than of what now seems to us  most distressful, dark, and objectless, the glorious aim which was then  in the mind of Him in whose hand are all the corners of the earth! how  little imagined that in the laws which were stretching forth the gloomy  margins of those fruitless banks, and feeding the bitter grass among  their shallows, there was indeed a preparation, and _the only  preparation possible_, for the founding of a city which was to be set  like a golden clasp on the girdle of the earth, to write her history on  the white scrolls of the sea-surges, and to word it in their thunder,  and to gather and give forth, in worldwide pulsation, the glory of the  West and of the East, from the burning heart of her Fortitude and  Splendor.

Seven miles to the north of Venice, the banks of sand, which near  the city rise little above low-water mark, attain by degrees a higher  level, and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass, raised  here and there into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks  of sea. One of the feeblest of these inlets, after winding for some time  among buried fragments of masonry, and knots of sunburnt weeds whitened  with webs of fucus, stays itself in an utterly stagnant pool beside a  plot of greener grass covered with ground ivy and violets. On this mound  is built a rude brick campanile, of the commonest Lombardic type, which  if we ascend towards evening (and there are none to hinder us, the door  of its ruinous staircase swinging idly on its hinges), we may command  from it one of the most notable scenes in this wide world of ours. Far  as the eye can reach, a waste of wild sea moor, of a lurid ashen grey;  not like our northern moors with their jet-black pools and purple heath,  but lifeless, the color of sackcloth, with the corrupted sea-water  soaking through the roots of its acrid weeds, and gleaming hither and  thither through its snaky channels. No gathering of fantastic mists, nor  coursing of clouds across it; but melancholy clearness of space in the  warm sunset, oppressive, reaching to the horizon of its level gloom. To  the very horizon, on the north-east; but, to the north and west, there  is a blue line of higher land along the border of it, and above this,  but farther back, a misty band of mountains, touched with snow. To the  east, the paleness and roar of the Adriatic, louder at momentary  intervals as the surf breaks on the bars of sand; to the south, the  widening branches of the calm lagoon, alternately purple and pale  green, as they reflect the evening clouds or twilight sky; and almost  beneath our feet, on the same field which sustains the tower we gaze  from, a group of four buildings, two of them little larger than cottages  (though built of stone, and one adorned by a quaint belfry), the third  an octagonal chapel, of which we can see but little more than the flat  red roof with its rayed tiling, the fourth, a considerable church with  nave and aisles, but of which, in like manner, we can see little but the  long central ridge and lateral slopes of roof, which the sunlight  separates in one glowing mass from the green field beneath and grey moor  beyond. There are no living creatures near the buildings, nor any  vestige of village or city round about them. They lie like a little  company of ships becalmed on a far-away sea.    Sec. II. Then look farther to the south. Beyond the widening branches of  the lagoon, and rising out of the bright lake into which they gather,  there are a multitude of towers, dark, and scattered among square-set  shapes of clustered palaces, a long and irregular line fretting the  southern sky.    Mother and daughter, you behold them both in their widowhood,--TORCELLO  and VENICE.    Thirteen hundred years ago, the grey moorland looked as it does this  day, and the purple mountains stood as radiantly in the deep distances  of evening; but on the line of the horizon, there were strange fires  mixed with the light of sunset, and the lament of many human voices  mixed with the fretting of the waves on their ridges of sand. The flames  rose from the ruins of Altinum; the lament from the multitude of its  people, seeking, like Israel of old, a refuge from the sword in the  paths of the sea.

It is as if  the soul of man, itself severed from the root of its health, and about  to fall into corruption, lost the perception of life in all things  around it; and could no more distinguish the wave of the strong  branches, full of muscular strength and sanguine circulation, from the  lax bending of a broken cord, nor the sinuousness of the edge of the  leaf, crushed into deep folds by the expansion of its living growth,  from the wrinkled contraction of its decay.[1] Thus, in morals, there  is a care for trifles which proceeds from love and conscience, and is  most holy; and a care for trifles which comes of idleness and frivolity,  and is most base. And so, also, there is a gravity proceeding from  thought, which is most noble; and a gravity proceeding from dulness and  mere incapability of enjoyment, which is most base. Now, in the various  forms assumed by the later Gothic of Venice, there are one or two  features which, under other circumstances, would not have been signs of  decline; but, in the particular manner of their occurrence here,  indicate the fatal weariness of decay. Of all these features the most  distinctive are its crockets and finials.    Sec. XIV. There is not to be found a single crocket or finial upon any  part of the Ducal Palace built during the fourteenth century; and although  they occur on contemporary, and on some much earlier, buildings, they  either indicate detached examples of schools not properly Venetian, or  are signs of incipient decline.    The reason of this is, that the finial is properly the ornament of  gabled architecture; it is the compliance, in the minor features of the  building, with the spirit of its towers, ridged roof, and spires.  Venetian building is not gabled, but horizontal in its roots and general  masses; therefore the finial is a feature contradictory to its spirit,  and adopted only in that search for morbid excitement which is the  infallible indication of decline. When it occurs earlier, it is on  fragments of true gabled architecture, as, for instance, on the porch of  the Carmini.    In proportion to the unjustifiableness of its introduction was the  extravagance of the form it assumed; becoming, sometimes, a tuft at the  top of the ogee windows, half as high as the arch itself, and  consisting, in the richest examples, of a human figure, half emergent  out of a cup of leafage, as, for instance, in the small archway of the  Campo San Zaccaria: while the crockets, as being at the side of the  arch, and not so strictly connected with its balance and symmetry,  appear to consider themselves at greater liberty even than the finials,  and fling themselves, hither and thither, in the wildest contortions.  Fig. 4. in Plate I, is the outline of one, carved in stone, from the  later Gothic of St. Mark's; fig. 3. a crocket from the fine Veronese  Gothic; in order to enable the reader to discern the Renaissance  character better by comparison with the examples of curvature above  them, taken from the manuscripts. And not content with this exuberance  in the external ornaments of the arch, the finial interferes with its  traceries. The increased intricacy of these, as such, being a natural  process in the developement of Gothic, would have been no evil; but they  are corrupted by the enrichment of the finial at the point of the  cusp,--corrupted, that is to say, in Venice: for at Verona the finial,  in the form of a fleur-de-lis, appears long previously at the cusp  point, with exquisite effect; and in our own best Northern Gothic it is  often used beautifully in this place, as in the window from Salisbury,  Plate XII. (Vol. II.), fig. 2. But in Venice, such a treatment of it was  utterly contrary to the severe spirit of the ancient traceries; and the  adoption of a leafy finial at the extremity of the cusps in the door of  San Stefano, as opposed to the simple ball which terminates those of the  Ducal Palace, is an unmistakable indication of a tendency to decline.    In like manner, the enrichment and complication of the jamb mouldings,  which, in other schools, might and did take place in the healthiest  periods, are, at Venice, signs of decline, owing to the entire  inconsistency of such mouldings with the ancient love of the single  square jamb and archivolt. The process of enrichment in them is shown by  the successive examples given in Plate VII., below. They are numbered,  and explained in the Appendix.    Sec. XV. The date at which this corrupt form of Gothic first prevailed  over the early simplicity of the Venetian types can be determined in an  instant, on the steps of the choir of the Church of St. John and Paul.  On our left hand, as we enter, is the tomb of the Doge Marco Cornaro,  who died in 1367. It is rich and fully developed Gothic, with crockets  and finials, but not yet attaining any extravagant developement.  Opposite to it is that of the Doge Andrea Morosini, who died in 1382.  Its Gothic is voluptuous, and over-wrought; the crockets are bold and  florid, and the enormous finial represents a statue of St. Michael.  There is no excuse for the antiquaries who, having this tomb before  them, could have attributed the severe architecture of the Ducal Palace  to a later date; for every one of the Renaissance errors is here in  complete developement, though not so grossly as entirely to destroy the  loveliness of the Gothic forms. In the Porta della Carta, 1423, the vice  reaches its climax.    Sec. XVI. Against this degraded Gothic, then, came up the Renaissance  armies; and their first assault was in the requirement of universal  perfection. For the first time since the destruction of Rome, the world  had seen, in the work of the greatest artists of the fifteenth  century,--in the painting of Ghirlandajo, Masaccio, Francia, Perugino,  Pinturicchio, and Bellini; in the sculpture of Mino da Fiesole, of  Ghiberti, and Verrocchio,--a perfection of execution and fulness of  knowledge which cast all previous art into the shade, and which, being  in the work of those men united with all that was great in that of  former days, did indeed justify the utmost enthusiasm with which their  efforts were, or could be, regarded. But when this perfection had once  been exhibited in anything, it was required in everything; the world  could no longer be satisfied with less exquisite execution, or less  disciplined knowledge. The first thing that it demanded in all work was,  that it should be done in a consummate and learned way; and men  altogether forgot that it was possible to consummate what was  contemptible, and to know what was useless. Imperatively requiring  dexterity of touch, they gradually forgot to look for tenderness of  feeling; imperatively requiring accuracy of knowledge, they gradually  forgot to ask for originality of thought. The thought and the feeling  which they despised departed from them, and they were left to  felicitate themselves on their small science and their neat fingering.  This is the history of the first attack of the Renaissance upon the  Gothic schools, and of its rapid results, more fatal and immediate in  architecture than in any other art, because there the demand for  perfection was less reasonable, and less consistent with the  capabilities of the workman; being utterly opposed to that rudeness or  savageness on which, as we saw above, the nobility of the elder schools  in great part depends. But inasmuch as the innovations were founded on  some of the most beautiful examples of art, and headed by some of the  greatest men that the world ever saw, and as the Gothic with which they  interfered was corrupt and valueless, the first appearance of the  Renaissance feeling had the appearance of a healthy movement. A new  energy replaced whatever weariness or dulness had affected the Gothic  mind; an exquisite taste and refinement, aided by extended knowledge,  furnished the first models of the new school; and over the whole of  Italy a style arose, generally now known as cinque-cento, which in  sculpture and painting, as I just stated, produced the noblest masters  which the world ever saw, headed by Michael Angelo, Raphael, and  Leonardo; but which failed of doing the same in architecture, because,  as we have seen above, perfection is therein not possible, and failed  more totally than it would otherwise have done, because the classical  enthusiasm had destroyed the best types of architectural form.    Sec. XVII. For, observe here very carefully, the Renaissance principle,  as it consisted in a demand for universal perfection, is quite distinct  from the Renaissance principle as it consists in a demand for classical  and Roman _forms_ of perfection. And if I had space to follow out the  subject as I should desire, I would first endeavor to ascertain what  might have been the course of the art of Europe if no manuscripts of  classical authors had been recovered, and no remains of classical  architecture left, in the fifteenth century; so that the executive  perfection to which the efforts of all great men had tended for five  hundred years, and which now at last was reached, might have been  allowed to develope itself in its own natural and proper form, in  connexion with the architectural structure of earlier schools. This  refinement and perfection had indeed its own perils, and the history of  later Italy, as she sank into pleasure and thence into corruption, would  probably have been the same whether she had ever learned again to write  pure Latin or not. Still the inquiry into the probable cause of the  enervation which might naturally have followed the highest exertion of  her energies, is a totally distinct one from that into the particular  form given to this enervation by her classical learning; and it is  matter of considerable regret to me that I cannot treat these two  subjects separately: I must be content with marking them for separation  in"]]]
