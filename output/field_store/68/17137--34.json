I have seen several skulls where a  division in the parietal bone or the temporal squama presented at the  same time features of a fracture and suture; in one or two of these  cases so much so, that it was and still is impossible for me to decide  exactly which of the two conditions I had before me. Gruber describes  one such case[12] as an instance of an oblique parietal suture, while  Hyrtl and Ranke both consider this case as one with an acquired  division. To differentiate a congenital real oblique suture from a  division which is the result of a fracture, we must be guided largely  by the situation, form, and serration of the division, and the  condition of the surrounding bones, especially that of the opposite  parietal. A straight course, ending with one extremity in or near the  middle of the anterior or posterior border of the parietal, a complex  serration, no continuity of the division on the neighboring bones, and  particularly a co-existence of an allied or similar division on the  opposite parietal,--all favor the conclusion that the division under  consideration is a real congenital suture, and not the result of a  fracture.    In the second case there are reasons for believing that an oblique  suture of the parietal bone can originate in the same way as the  horizontal one, namely, through a persistence of the original separation  between the two centres from which the bone is developed, and a  co-existent difference in the relative position or the relative growth  of the two centres. It is in this connection that the above-described  division in the parietals of the chimpanzee will prove of value.    The occasional persistence of the separation between the two original  segments of the parietal bone is sufficiently demonstrated by the  presence of the complete horizontal parietal suture. Differences in  the relative position of these segments can be observed in a limited  degree in Ranke's illustrations of embryos, before referred to; it can  be deduced from such cases as the two of Hyrtl,[13] in which the  division of the parietal was directed from the upper portion of the  anterior to the lower portion of the posterior border of the bone. The  most pronounced change in the position of these centres may be  witnessed in cases where the parietal bone shows a perfect vertical  instead of a horizontal suture. Such cases have been referred to  before, and I presented at the meeting of the Association of American  Anatomists, in 1899, several such examples, found by me in skulls of  monkeys in Professor Huntington's anatomical collection in the Medical  Department of Columbia University. One of these specimens is shown in  the accompanying illustration (Fig. 5).    A difference in the relative growth of the two centres of the  parietal bone is well shown in the difference of size between the  inferior and superior portions of the parietal in cases of the  complete horizontal suture in the same. In the majority of such cases  on record the superior portion is larger, particularly anteriorly,  than the inferior; so much so, that that condition seems to be the  typical one. The difference in the size of the two portions of the  parietal, and in their relative anterior and posterior height, is most  pronounced in one of Gruber's cases,[14] where the \"parietal suture\"  begins only 10 mm. above the pterion, and ends 40 mm. above the  asterion. In Dorsey's case[15] the lower portion of the divided  parietal is 12 mm. higher than the upper. The same condition as is  found in Gruber's case, here mentioned, exists in the almost identical  left division of the second case of Putnam, of which I have a  photograph in my hands. A somewhat similar excess of the posterior  over the anterior part of the lower severed portion of the parietal  can also be seen in the illustrations of the cases of Tarin, Lucae,  and Turner (Admiralty Islands skull). In Calori's interesting case[16]  there is a decided excess of the lower portion of the divided parietal  in its posterior portion on the left and in its anterior portion on  the right side.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. _Macacus rhesus_ (Medical Department, Columbia  University), showing a Complete Division of the Right Parietal Bone in  a Vertical Direction.]    In case the upper segment was not vertically above the lower one, but  in a position a little more forward or backward of it; and,  furthermore, if the relative growth of the two segments differed, and  their separation remained permanent,--the separation of any portion of  the parietal bone in almost any form and to almost any extent might  result. Such coincidence of anomalous conditions, although  necessarily rare, cannot, from what we know on the subject in parietal  and other bones, be declared improbable. All cases where oblique  suture on one side co-exists with more or less horizontal suture on  the other side in the parietal bone, as in the second of Putnam's  cases, would of course point directly to a similar origin of the  anomaly on both sides of the cranium. That such cases have not been  more frequently observed is largely due, I think, to the rarity of  bilateral parietal divisions.    A third mode of development of the oblique suture in the parietal bone  suggests itself where the severed portion of the bone is small, and  that is the possible existence of a supernumerary, third centre of  ossification. I am by no means ready to defend this theory, yet there  are cases in which it would afford the easiest explanation. I have a  Peruvian skull at hand, in which there is a bilateral, quite  symmetrical quadrangular separate piece of bone, encroaching on the  mastoid process of the parietal. The surface of the left parietal bone  in this skull measures across its middle in antero-posterior direction  120 mm., in infero-superior direction 130 mm.; similar measures of the  right parietal are respectively 117 and 130 mm. The separate bone on  the left measures across its middle in antero-posterior direction 20  mm., in infero-superior direction 12 to 21 mm.; the same portion on  the right measures respectively 25 and 11 to 15 mm. Both pieces are  joined to the parietal bone by a squamous suture (Fig. 6).    [Illustration: Fig. 6 (99/3550). Quadrilateral Fontanel Bones in a  Peruvian Male Skull, encroaching upon the Mastoid Angle of the  Parietals.]    It is apparent that the separate pieces of bone in this case are too  small to be easily taken for representatives of one of the regular  centres of ossification of the parietal bone; but the same pieces are  somewhat too large, and especially too singularly outlined and joined  to the parietal, to be without difficulty diagnosed as simple Wormian  or fontanel bones. One of Ranke's cases,[17] though the separation of  the mastoid angle is oblong instead of quadrangular, as in the  Peruvian skull, seems to me to present a similar difficulty in  properly diagnosing the nature of the severed portion. This group of  cases needs further observation, particularly on the bones of infants  and embryos. I have two monkey skulls at hand which actually show a  multiplicity of the original segments of the parietal. These specimens  will be described in a future publication.    So much as to the _formation_ of the oblique sutures in the parietal.  It should not be forgotten that such sutures can be _simulated_ by  those which divide true Wormian or fontanel bones from the parietal.  The distinction between the real oblique parietal and these  extra-parietal sutures must depend largely on the extent of the  division and form of the separate piece of bone.    We may now return to the skull of our chimpanzee. In considering the  nature of the divisions in the parietal bones of this skull, we can at  once and absolutely discard the idea of the divisions being due to  fractures, or being boundaries of Wormian or fontanel bones, and thus  really extra-parietal in their nature. There is nothing about the  sutures, or the divided pieces, or the neighboring bones, that would  even suggest such an explanation; and in our records on Wormian and  fontanel bones we find no analogies either in man, or apes, or lower  animals, to the conditions here observed. The necessary conclusion  from this can only be that we have before us two examples of real  parietal division.    The division on the left side, had it existed alone, would be readily  acceptable as an instance of the \"parietal suture.\" The anterior  extremity and more than the anterior third of the course of the  division correspond exactly to the same features of a typical,  horizontal \"parietal suture;\" while the elevation of the posterior  extremity of the division, though unusual, can readily be explained as  due to an excess in growth of the inferior original centre of the  bone, which may, in addition, have been situated slightly posterior to  the upper centre.    The division in the right parietal of the chimpanzee begins at its  anterior end, and runs for the first third of its course in the same  way as that on the left side; its posterior end, however, does not  reach the lambdoid, but turns up and ends in the sagittal border.  Should this formation have existed alone, I should be inclined to  consider it either as the result of an accessory centre of the  parietal, or, possibly, as a persistence of the anterior portion of  the divided superior centre of the bone, the posterior portion of the  same being united with the lower segment of the parietal in the usual  way. With the division of the left parietal in the same skull before  me, everything points to a similar origin of the division on both  sides, and to the right as well as the left division being a true  \"parietal suture,\" deflected less on the left and more on the right  side by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#3)"],[1,"about 30 inches apart, cut a pole 10 feet long for a bed piece  and place in front of trees then cut a notch in each tree about 27  inches above the bed piece, and nail a good, strong piece across from  one tree to the other in the notches. Cut a long pole five or six  inches through for the deadfall, place the large end on top of bed  log, letting end stick by the tree far enough to place on poles for  weights.    Then cut two stakes and drive on outside of both poles, and fasten  top of stakes to the trees one foot above the cross piece. Then on  the inside, 30 inches from the trees, drive two more solid stakes  about 2 feet apart and nail a piece across them 6 inches lower than  the cross piece between the trees. Then cut a lever about three feet  long and flatten one end, and a bait stick about two feet long. Cut  two notches 6 inches apart, one square on the top and the other on  the bottom, and both close to the top end of bait stick.    Fasten bait on the other end and then raise up the deadfall, place  the lever stick across the stick nailed between the two trees,  letting the end run six inches under the deadfall. Take the bait  stick and hook lower notch on the piece nailed on the two stakes and  place end of lever in the top notch, then cut weights and place on  each side until you think you have enough to hold any bear. Then put  on as many more and it will be about right. Stand up old chunks  around the sides and back and lots of green brush on the outside. Get  it so he can't see the bait.    It doesn't require a very solid pen. I drive about three short stakes  in front and leave them one foot high, so when he pulls back they  will come against him, and the set is complete. You can weight it  with a ton of poles and still it will spring easy. The closer  together the two notches the easier it will spring.    This trap can be built lighter and is good for coon. In fact, will  catch other fur bearers, but is not especially recommended for small  animals, such as ermine and mink.        CHAPTER III.    OTTER DEADFALLS.    At the present day when steel traps are so cheap and abundant it may  sound very primitive and an uncertain way of trapping these animals  for one to advocate the use of the deadfall, especially as every  hunter knows the animal is much more at home in the water than on  land. But on land they go and it was by deadfalls the way-back  Indians killed a many that were in their packs at the end of the  hunting season.    Of course these wooden traps were not set at haphazard thru the brush  as marten traps, but were set up at the otter slide places, and where  they crossed points in river bends, or it might be where a narrow  strip of land connected two lakes. These places were known from one  generation to another and the old traps were freshened up spring and  fall by some member of the family hunting those grounds.    These special deadfalls were called otter traps, but really when once  set were open for most any animal of a medium size passing that path.  The writer has known beaver, lynx, fox and in one instance a cub bear  to be caught in one of these deadfalls. There was a simplicity and  usefulness about these traps that commended them to the trapper and  even now in this rush century some hunters might use them with  advantage.    When once set, they remain so until some animal comes along and is  caught. I say \"caught\" because if properly erected they rarely miss.  They require no bait and therefore are never out of order by the  depredations of mice, squirrels or moose birds. I knew a man who  caught two otters together. This may sound fishy, but when once a  present generation trapper sees one of these traps set he will  readily believe this apparently impossible result is quite likely to  happen.    The trap is made thus: Cut four forked young birch about five feet  long, pointing the lower ends and leaving the forks uppermost. Plant  two of these firmly in the ground at each side of the otter path,  three inches apart between them and about twenty inches across the  path. These must be driven very hard in the ground and a throat piece  put in level between the uprights across the path from side to side.  As a choker and to support the weight of logs to kill the otter, cut  a pole (tamarac preferable) long enough to pass three feet each side  of your picket or uprights, see that this falls easy and clear.      [Illustration: OTTER DEADFALL.]    Now cut two short poles for the forks to lay in from side to side of  the path, being in the same direction as the choker. At the middle of  one of these short poles tie a good stout cord or rope (the Indians  used split young roots), making a loop of same long enough to lay  over the pole in front and down to the height the choke pole is going  to be. When set, next comes the trigger which must be of hard wood  and about a foot long, round at one end and flat at the other. A  groove is hacked out all around the stick at the round end. This is  to tie the cord to.    The choke stick is now brought up to say twenty inches from the  ground and rested on top of the trigger. A stick about an inch in  diameter is placed outside the pickets and the flat end of the  trigger is laid in against this. The tied stick to be about eight  inches from the ground. The tying at the end of the trigger being at  one side will create a kind of leverage sufficiently strong to press  hard against the tied stick. Care must be taken, however, to have  this pressure strong enough but not too strong for the animal to set  off.    Now load each end of the choke stick with small laps of wood to  insure holding whatever may catch. A little loose moss or grass is  placed fluffy under tread stick when set to insure the otter going  over and not under. When he clambers over the tread stick his weight  depresses it, the trigger flies up, letting the loaded bar fall on  his body, which holds him till death.    While my description of the making of a deadfall for otters is plain  enough to me, yet the novice may not succeed in constructing one the  first time. Still if he is a trapper he will very soon perceive where  any mistake may be and correct it. I have used both steel traps and  deadfalls and altho I do not wish to start a controversy yet I must  say that a deadfall well set is a good trap. For marten on a stump  they are never covered unless with snow, nor is the marten when  caught destroyed by mice.    Of course, to set a deadfall for otter it must be done in the fall  before the ground is frozen. Once made, however, it can be set up  either spring or fall and will, with a little repairs, last for  years. I am aware the tendency of the age is to progress and not to  use obsolete methods, still even some old things have their  advantages. Good points are not to be sneered at and one of these I  maintain for spring and fall trapping in a district where otter move  about from lake to lake or river to river is the old time Indian  deadfall.        CHAPTER IV.    MARTEN DEADFALL.    Having seen a good many descriptions of deadfalls in the H-T-T  lately, writes a Colorado trapper, I thought I would try to show the  kind that is used around here for marten. It is easily made, and can  always be kept above the snow.    First, cut a pole (z) five or six inches through and twelve feet  long, lay it in the crotch of a tree five feet from the ground. Then  cut two sticks two inches through and fifteen inches long, cut a  notch in each three inches from the top and have the notch in one  slant downwards (B), the other upwards (A). The sticks should be  nailed on each side of the pole (z), the top of which should be  flattened a little. Have the notches about six inches above the top  of the pole.    Cut another stick 10 inches long (F), cut the top off square and nail  it six inches farther down the pole on the same side as (B), have the  top five inches above the top of pole (Z). Now cut two more sticks  two and one-half feet long (C-D), cut a notch in each two inches from  the top and nail a stick (E) across them in the notches, so they will  be about seven inches apart. Set a straddle of the pole (Z); they  should be two inches farther down the pole than (F). Then cut another  pole (X) ten feet long, lay it under (Z), lift up one end of it and  nail the stick C and D to each side of it. See that when the sticks  C, D and E are lifted up they will fall clear and easily.      [Illustration: MARTEN DEADFALL.]    Now cut a bait stick (G) one-half inch through and seven inches long,  sharpened at one end. Cut another stick (H) an inch through and  fifteen inches long, flatten a little on one side. To set the trap  lift up C, D, E and X, and put the end of H under E and rest it on  the top of F, hold down the other end while you put the bait stick  (G) in the notches A and B, then let the end of H come up on the  outside of B against the end of G. Put the bait on the other end of  G; when the end is pulled out of the notch the trap will spring and  spring easily if made properly. Lay a block of wood at the back end  and some small sticks on top, so the animal will have to crawl under  E to get the bait. Muskrat makes the best bait for marten.      * * *    When you find a tall straight spruce or something that is pretty  straight (not a balsam) cut it about a foot over your head, says a  Northwestern trapper, or as high as you can. When you have cut it,  split the stump down the center two feet. Be careful doing this, for  you are striking a dangerous blow as I have good cause to know and  remember. Trim out the tree clean and taper off the butt end to make  it enter into split. Drive down into split about fourteen inches. Cut  a crotch into ground or snow solid.    Now cut the mate of this piece already in, split and put into split  and into crotch on top of other. Have the piece heavy enough to hold  wolverine. See cuts for the rest. Cover bait as shown in cut. I"]]]
