I suspect that those who have criticised Mr.       Hope's work with asperity have never seen his house.         These sentiments are not the result of partiality or       prejudice, for I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Hope. They       are delivered with zeal, but with deference. It is quite       consolatory to find a gentleman of large fortune, of       respectable ancestry, and of classical attainments, devoting       a great portion of that leisure time which hangs like a       leaden weight upon the generality of fashionable people, to       the service of the Fine Arts, and in the patronage of merit       and ingenuity. How much the world will again be indebted to       Mr. Hope's taste and liberality may be anticipated from the       \"_Costume of the Ancients_,\" a work which has recently been       published under his particular superintendence.]         [Footnote A: This book is beautifully executed, undoubtedly,       but being little more than a thin folio pamphlet devoid of       _typographical_ embellishment--it has been thought by some       hardly fair to say this of a press which brought out so many       works characterized by magnitude and various elegance. B.B.]    To say that I was not gratified by the perusal of it would be a  confession contrary to the truth; but to say how ardently I  anticipated an amplification of the subject, how eagerly I looked  forward to a number of curious, apposite, and amusing anecdotes, and  found them not therein, is an avowal of which I need not fear the  rashness, when the known talents of the detector of Stern's  plagiarisms[4] are considered. I will not, however, disguise to you  that I read it with uniform delight, and that I rose from the perusal  with a keener appetite for         \"The small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold.\"         _Dr. Ferriar's Ep._ v. 138.         [Footnote 4: In the fourth volume of the Transactions of the       Manchester Literary Society, part iv., p. 45-87, will be       found a most ingenious and amusing Essay, entitled       \"_Comments on Sterne_,\" which excited a good deal of       interest at the time of its publication. This discovery may       be considered, in some measure, as the result of the       BIBLIOMANIA. In my edition of Sir Thomas More's Utopia, a       suggestion is thrown out that even Burton may have been an       imitator of Boisatuau [Transcriber's Note: Boiastuau]: see       vol. II. 143.]    Whoever undertakes to write down the follies which grow out of an  excessive attachment to any particular pursuit, be that pursuit  horses,[5] hawks, dogs, guns, snuff boxes,[6] old china, coins, or  rusty armour, may be thought to have little consulted the best means  of ensuring success for his labours, when he adopts the dull vehicle  of _Prose_ for the commnication [Transcriber's Note: communication] of  his ideas not considering that from _Poetry_ ten thousand bright  scintillations are struck off, which please and convince while they  attract and astonish. Thus when Pope talks of allotting for         \"Pembroke[7] Statues, dirty Gods and Coins;       Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne[8] alone;       And books to Mead[9] and butterflies to Sloane,\"[10]    when he says that         These Aldus[11] printed, those Du Sueil has bound[12]    moreover that         For Locke or Milton[13] 'tis in vain to look;       These shelves admit not any modern book;    he not only seems to illustrate the propriety of the foregoing  remark, by shewing the immense superiority of verse to prose, in  ridiculing reigning absurdities, but he seems to have had a pretty  strong foresight of the BIBLIOMANIA which rages at the present day.  However, as the ancients tell us that a Poet cannot be a  _manufactured_ creature, and as I have not the smallest pretensions  to the \"rhyming art,\" [although in former times[14] I did venture to  dabble with it] I must of necessity have recourse to _Prose_; and, at  the same time, to your candour and forbearance in perusing the pages  which ensue.         [Footnote 5: It may be taken for granted that the first book       in this country which excited a passion for the _Sports of       the field_ was Dame Juliana Berners, or Barnes's, work, on       _Hunting and Hawking_, printed at St. Alban's, in the year       1486; of which Lord Spencer's copy is, I believe, the only       perfect one known. It was formerly the Poet Mason's, and is       mentioned in the quarto edition of Hoccleve's Poems, p. 19,       1786. See too Bibl. Mason. Pt. iv. No. 153. Whether the       forementioned worthy lady was really the author of the work       has been questioned. Her book was reprinted by Wynkyn de       Worde in 1497, with an additional Treatise on _Fishing_. The       following specimen, from this latter edition, ascertains the       general usage of the French language with our huntsmen in       the 15th century.

Those who are anxious to       procure the rare books mentioned in these bibliographical       treatises, may be pretty safely taxed with being infected by       the BIBLIOMANIA. What apology my friend Mr. Haslewood, the       author of them, has to offer in extenuation of the mischief       committed, it is _his_ business, and not mine, to consider;       and what the public will say to his curious forthcoming       reprint of the ancient edition of Wynkyn De Worde _on       Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing_, 1497 (with wood cuts), I       will not pretend to divine!         In regard to Hawking, I believe the enterprising Colonel       Thornton in [Transcriber's Note: is] the only gentleman of       the present day who keeps up this custom of \"good old       times.\"         The Sultans of the East seem not to have been insensible to       the charms of Falconry, if we are to judge from the evidence       of Tippoo Saib having a work of this kind in his library;       which is thus described from the Catalogue of it just       published in a fine quarto volume, of which only 250 copies       are printed.         \"_Shabbar Nameh_, 4to. a Treatise on Falcony;       containing Instructions for selecting the best species of       Hawks, and the method of teaching them; describing their       different qualities; also the disorders they are subject to,       and method of cure.

Of _Old China_, _Coins_, and _Rusty Armour_, the names of       hundreds present themselves in these departments; but to the       more commonly-known ones of Rawle and Grose, let me add that       of the late Mr. John White, of Newgate-Street; a catalogue       of whose curiosities [including some very uncommon books]       was published "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#3)"],[1,"/2 to 3/4 inch thick. The shells of the jacket are braced  together by a large number of rivets, RR; and the top, or crown, is  strengthened by heavy longitudinal girders riveted to it, or is braced  to the top of the boiler by long bolts. A large number of fire-tubes  (only three are shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity) extend  from the fire-box to the smoke-box. The most powerful \"mammoth\" American  locomotives have 350 or more tubes, which, with the fire-box, give 4,000  square feet of surface for the furnace heat to act upon. These tubes  are expanded at their ends by a special tool into the tube-plates of the  fire-box and boiler front. George Stephenson and his predecessors  experienced great difficulty in rendering the tube-end joints quite  water-tight, but the invention of the \"expander\" has removed this  trouble.    The _fire-brick arch_ shown (Fig. 6) in the fire-box is used to deflect  the flames towards the back of the fire-box, so that the hot gases may  be retarded somewhat, and their combustion rendered more perfect. It  also helps to distribute the heat more evenly over the whole of the  inside of the box, and prevents cold air from flying directly from the  firing door to the tubes. In some American and Continental locomotives  the fire-brick arch is replaced by a \"water bridge,\" which serves the  same purpose, while giving additional heating surface.    The water circulation in a locomotive boiler is--upwards at the fire-box  end, where the heat is most intense; forward along the surface;  downwards at the smoke-box end; backwards along the bottom of the  barrel.      OTHER TYPES OF BOILERS.    For small stationary land engines the _vertical_ boiler is much used.  In Fig. 8 we have three forms of this type--A and B with cross  water-tubes; C with vertical fire-tubes. The furnace in every case is  surrounded by water, and fed through a door at one side.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Diagrammatic representation of three types of  vertical boilers.]    The _Lancashire_ boiler is of large size. It has a cylindrical shell,  measuring up to 30 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter, traversed from  end to end by two large flues, in the rear part of which are situated  the furnaces. The boiler is fixed on a seating of fire-bricks, so built  up as to form three flues, A and BB, shown in cross section in Fig. 9.  The furnace gases, after leaving the two furnace flues, are deflected  downwards into the channel A, by which they pass underneath the boiler  to a point almost under the furnace, where they divide right and left  and travel through cross passages into the side channels BB, to be led  along the boiler's flanks to the chimney exit C. By this arrangement the  effective heating surface is greatly increased; and the passages being  large, natural draught generally suffices to maintain proper combustion.  The Lancashire boiler is much used in factories and (in a modified form)  on ships, since it is a steady steamer and is easily kept in order.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Cross and longitudinal sections of a Lancashire  boiler.]    In marine boilers of cylindrical shape cross water-tubes and fire-tubes  are often employed to increase the heating surface. Return tubes are  also led through the water to the funnels, situated at the same end as  the furnace.      AIDS TO COMBUSTION.    We may now turn our attention more particularly to the chemical process  called _combustion_, upon which a boiler depends for its heat. Ordinary  steam coal contains about 85 per cent. of carbon, 7 per cent. of oxygen,  and 4 per cent. of hydrogen, besides traces of nitrogen and sulphur and  a small incombustible residue. When the coal burns, the nitrogen is  released and passes away without combining with any of the other  elements. The sulphur unites with hydrogen and forms sulphuretted  hydrogen (also named sulphurous acid), which is injurious to steel  plates, and is largely responsible for the decay of tubes and funnels.  More of the hydrogen unites with the oxygen as steam.    The most important element in coal is the carbon (known chemically by  the symbol C). Its combination with oxygen, called combustion, is the  act which heats the boiler. Only when the carbon present has combined  with the greatest possible amount of oxygen that it will take into  partnership is the combustion complete and the full heat-value (fixed by  scientific experiment at 14,500 thermal units per pound of carbon)  developed.    Now, carbon may unite with oxygen, atom for atom, and form _carbon  monoxide_ (CO); or in the proportion of one atom of carbon to _two_ of  oxygen, and form _carbon dioxide_ (CO_2). The former gas is  combustible--that is, will admit another atom of carbon to the  molecule--but the latter is saturated with oxygen, and will not burn,  or, to put it otherwise, is the product of _perfect_ combustion. A  properly designed furnace, supplied with a due amount of air, will cause  nearly all the carbon in the coal burnt to combine with the full amount  of oxygen. On the other hand, if the oxygen supply is inefficient, CO as  well as CO_2 will form, and there will be a heat loss, equal in  extreme cases to two-thirds of the whole. It is therefore necessary that  a furnace which has to eat up fuel at a great pace should be  artificially fed with air in the proportion of from 12 to 20 _pounds_ of  air for every pound of fuel. There are two methods of creating a violent  draught through the furnace. The first is--    The _forced draught_; very simply exemplified by the ordinary bellows  used in every house. On a ship (Fig. 10) the principle is developed as  follows:--The boilers are situated in a compartment or compartments  having no communication with the outer air, except for the passages down  which air is forced by powerful fans at a pressure considerably greater  than that of the atmosphere. There is only one \"way out\"--namely,  through the furnace and tubes (or gas-ways) of the boiler, and the  funnel. So through these it rushes, raising the fuel to white heat. As  may easily be imagined, the temperature of a stokehold, especially in  the tropics, is far from pleasant. In the Red Sea the thermometer  sometimes rises to 170 deg. Fahrenheit or more, and the poor stokers have  a very bad time of it.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Sketch showing how the \"forced draught\" is  produced in a stokehold and how it affects the furnaces.]    [Illustration: SCENE IN THE STOKEHOLD OF A BATTLE-SHIP.]    The second system is that of the _induced draught_. Here air is  _sucked_ through the furnace by creating a vacuum in the funnel and in a  chamber opening into it. Turning to Fig. 6, we see a pipe through which  the exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders is shot upwards into  the funnel, in which, and in the smoke-box beneath it, a strong vacuum  is formed while the engine is running. Now, \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" so  air will get into the smoke-box if there be a way open. There  is--through the air-doors at the bottom of the furnace, the furnace  itself, and the fire-tubes; and on the way oxygen combines with the  carbon of the fuel, to form carbon dioxide. The power of the draught is  so great that, as one often notices when a train passes during the  night, red-hot cinders, plucked from the fire-box, and dragged through  the tubes, are hurled far into the air. It might be mentioned in  parenthesis that the so-called \"smoke\" which pours from the funnel of a  moving engine is mainly condensing steam. A steamship, on the other  hand, belches smoke only from its funnels, as fresh water is far too  precious to waste as steam. We shall refer to this later on (p. 72).      BOILER FITTINGS.    The most important fittings on a boiler are:--(1) the safety-valve; (2)  the water-gauge; (3) the steam-gauge; (4) the mechanisms for feeding it  with water.      THE SAFETY-VALVE.    Professor Thurston, an eminent authority on the steam-engine, has  estimated that a plain cylindrical boiler carrying 100 lbs. pressure to  the square inch contains sufficient stored energy to project it into the  air a vertical distance of 3-1/2 miles. In the case of a Lancashire  boiler at equal pressure the distance would be 2-1/2 miles; of a  locomotive boiler, at 125 lbs., 1-1/2 miles; of a steam tubular boiler,  at 75 lbs., 1 mile. According to the same writer, a cubic foot of heated  water under a pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs. per square inch has _about  the same energy as one pound of gunpowder_.    Steam is a good servant, but a terrible master. It must be kept under  strict control. However strong a boiler may be, it will burst if the  steam pressure in it be raised to a certain point; and some device must  therefore be fitted on it which will give the steam free egress before  that point is reached. A device of this kind is called a _safety-valve_.  It usually blows off at less than half the greatest pressure that the  boiler has been proved by experiment to be capable of withstanding.    In principle the safety-valve denotes an orifice closed by an  accurately-fitting plug, which is pressed against its seat on the boiler  top by a weighted lever, or by a spring. As soon as the steam pressure  on the face of the plug exceeds the counteracting force of the weight  or spring, the plug rises, and steam escapes until equilibrium of the  opposing forces is restored.    On stationary engines a lever safety-valve is commonly employed (Fig.  11). The blowing-off point can be varied by shifting the weight along  the arm so as to give it a greater or less leverage. On locomotive and  marine boilers, where shocks and movements have to be reckoned with,  weights are replaced by springs, set to a certain tension, and locked up  so that they cannot be tampered with.
