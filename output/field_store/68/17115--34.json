I just believe that that saying, and the other: 'Handsome is as handsome  does,' were invented by some ugly old thing with a skin as yellow as a  pumpkin. Oh, here is Adele at last!\"    Mrs. Raymond laughed, and turned toward the door through which her  daughter came, her face aglow with pride.    \"Beatrice has been ready a long time,\" she chided, the gentleness of her  tone softening the reproof. \"You should not have kept her waiting, my  daughter, when this is the day she is expecting a letter from her  father.\"    \"Don't scold her, auntie,\" pleaded Bee gazing at her cousin with  admiring eyes. \"Oh, Adele! how do you make yourself look so pretty?\"    Adele smiled, well pleased. She was accustomed to being told of her  beauty, but she never wearied of the homage it exacted.    \"You look nice too, Bee,\" she said condescendingly with a glance of  approval at Beatrice's white robed figure. \"Aren't you going to wear any  hat?\"    \"I am going to carry it until we reach the road.\" Bee caught up a broad  brimmed leghorn from a chair, and held it carelessly by the strings. \"I  don't like to wear one any more than I have to. I'll beat you to the  gate, Adele.\"    \"A race?\" Adele drew her brows together in a prim little frown. \"Such  great girls as we are. Why, we are almost young ladies! It would not be  proper.\"    \"Bother propriety!\" ejaculated her cousin. \"There is a whole year before  we are sixteen. We don't need to give up running until then. Do we,  auntie?\"    \"No;\" answered her aunt indulgently. \"Be girls just as long as you can.  You will be young ladies soon enough. I wish Adele would take more  exercise.\"    \"Just through the orchard then,\" cried Adele catching up her skirts  daintily. \"Here goes! Oh, Bee!\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Bee, surprised.    \"No wonder you could be dressed before I was,\" exclaimed Adele in  shocked tones. \"There are three buttons of your dress unfastened.\"    \"Are there?\" Bee backed up to her unconcernedly. \"Do button them, like a  dear. I never was good at closing exercises.\"    Adele giggled appreciatively.    \"Professor Lawrence says that closing exercises should be marked by  decorum as well as dispatch,\" she remarked in didatic accents. \"I  observe the dispatch, Miss Raymond, but I must say--\"    \"Oh, hurry up,\" interrupted Bee impatiently. \"What's a button more or  less on such a glorious day as this? Come on, or I shall run a race  with my shadow.\"    \"Catch me then.\" Adele darted away quickly. \"If I beat I shall read your  letter first.\"    \"Good-bye, dears,\" called Mrs. Raymond after them. \"Don't let her beat  you, Bee.\"    \"I won't, auntie,\" Beatrice paused long enough to say, and then sped  after her cousin.    There were ripples of sunshine all tangled over the bowers of apple  blooms, and dancing blithely over the mats of blue violets in the grass.  Gold belted honeybees hummed a song of contentment in every flowery  cluster. Gauze-winged dragon flies darted hither and thither, while  butterflies sailed by on new born wings of bronze, and scarlet and gold.  The wind laughed a gleeful accompaniment to the merry maidens who ran  gaily down the path o'ershadowed by the trees. Adele's graceful form was  in the lead, but Beatrice was gradually gaining upon her. At length, as  they were nearing the edge of the orchard, Bee gave an exultant shout  and passed her cousin, reaching the gate just ahead of her.    \"Weren't you awfully afraid that I'd get to read that letter?\" laughed  Adele as, flushed and panting, she leaned against the gate. \"How fast  you do run, Bee! I am all out of breath.\"    \"So am I,\" admitted Bee. \"We will have time to rest for a moment before  going on to the office. Take off your hat, and you will soon be cool.\"  She swung her own back and forth by the strings as she spoke.    \"I'm afraid of freckles,\" sighed her cousin.    \"Gracious!\" ejaculated Bee, quickly putting her hat on her head. \"I had  forgotten all about freckles. How can you always remember, Adele?\"    \"Perhaps if you had to take the care of your skin that I do, you would  not forget either.\"    \"But don't you ever get tired of it? I should think that you would want  to go bareheaded sometimes.\"    \"I would, Bee; but I like to keep my skin nice too. One can't do both.\"    \"Can't one?\" asked Bee thoughtfully. \"I should think that the skin would  need air and sunshine just like the flowers, and the butterflies, and  all other pretty growing things.\"    \"Mamma always puts her lillies in the shade, doesn't she?\" queried Adele  laughing. \"It keeps them white, and that's the reason she tells me to  keep on my hat. Tan and freckles may be healthful, but they are not  pretty. At least she doesn't think so. Do you know the reason that I  always give Dolly Madison as my favorite character in history, Bee?\"    \"No. I have wondered about it. I should think you would prefer Queen  Elizabeth, or Joan of Arc, or somebody like them. I like women who do  things. Miss Rosa Bonheur, Miss Herschel, or Grace Darling suit me  better.\"    \"Well, I like Dolly best because I sympathize with her. When she was a  little girl her mother cut holes in her sunbonnet, and tied her hair  through them so that she couldn't throw it off. She had a pretty skin  too, and her mother didn't want it to get tanned, or sun-burned. I  always think of what Dolly had to go through whenever I want to throw  off my hat, and it helps me to keep it on. I know just how she felt  about that everlasting bonnet. But after a while, you know, she became  the mistress of the White House.\"    Bee laughed outright.    \"Is that the reason that you are taking such good care of your  complexion?\" she asked teasingly. \"I never thought it of you, Adele.\"    \"Laugh if you want to,\" retorted Adele.    \"Isn't Professor Lawrence always telling the boys that one of them may  be President of the United States some day, and that every one of them  is eligible? Now the President has to have a wife, doesn't he? Well, I  never could see why a girl mightn't look forward to being the Mistress  of the White House as well as a boy might expect to be President.\"    \"If having a perfect complexion is one of the essentials toward becoming  the Mistress of the White House you are right in line for the position,\"  said Bee wiping her eyes. \"Never mind, Adele! I was just having a little  fun. Your skin is lovely, and I expect I would be just as careful as you  are if it were mine. I wonder how it would feel to be a beauty!\"    \"It's a great responsibility,\" declared Adele with a toss of her head.  \"There is so much to live up to. If I am the least bit untidy some one  is sure to say: 'Such a pretty girl should always be neat and dainty.'  Or, 'beauty and dirt don't go together, my dear.' While you--you can be  as careless as you wish, and no one thinks anything about it.\"    \"I am not so sure about that.\" Bee shook her head dubiously. \"Aunt Annie  is always taking me to task for my untidiness. And there is much  demanded of me in other ways. If you are expected to be neat and dainty  at all times, I am urged to be industrious.\"        \"'How doth the little busy bee      Improve each shining hour,      And gather honey all the day      From every opening flower!'\"    quoted Adele in a sing-song tone. \"Isn't that what the girls are always  saying, Bee? I never see you flying about the house helping mamma, or  running errands, or pouring over your books that I don't think of the  'Little busy bee.' Now I can't find time to do anything except to dress,  and to keep myself looking nice.\"    \"Well, a butterfly is not expected to do anything but to fly in the sun,  and be happy,\" laughed Bee. \"And you are like a golden and white  butterfly, Adele. Bees must make honey. They are too homely to do  anything else, while butterflies--\"    \"Speaking of butterflies,\" interrupted Adele quickly. \"There is one just  about to light on your head.\"    \"What kind is it?\" queried Beatrice holding her head very still, and  speaking anxiously. \"I hope it isn't a cabbage butterfly. I shouldn't  like to think that even a butterfly would take my head for a cabbage.\"    \"It's yellow and black, Bee. Is that the cabbage butterfly? I don't know  as much about such things as you do.\"    \"The cabbage butterfly is white. Has it settled yet?\"    \"Yes.\" Adele watched as a yellow and black Swallow Tail poised gently  upon Bee's head for a moment, and then flew away. \"There! it's gone.\"    \"That's a good omen,\" declared Bee turning toward the gate. \"Whenever a  butterfly lights on your head it means favorable news from a distance.  There will be something good in father's letter, I know. Come, Adele!  lets hurry so that we can get it.\"    Adele straightened her hat a little, and then the two girls set off for  the postoffice.          Chapter III    The Good News         \"As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far       country.\"         --_Proverbs._      \"Suppose there shouldn't be a letter,\" remarked Adele suggestively as  the cousins entered the postoffice. \"What would you do?\"    \"But there will be,\" answered Bee confidently. \"In all the years that he  has been away father has not failed to send me a letter once a month.  Even though it may not be an answer to my last, I'll get a letter.\"    She was not disappointed. There was a letter for her, and Adele received  one also.    \"Let's hurry to the old elm tree so that we can read them,\" cried Adele.  \"I wonder who mine's from? I didn't expect a letter.\"    Beatrice assented readily. The old elm tree stood by the side of the  road just outside the town and was a favorite resting place for  pedestrians. It did not take the girls long to reach the spot, so eager  were they to read their letters. Beatrice threw herself down on the  grass without ceremony, and tore open her epistle. Adele sank down with  a graceful and effective arrangement of her draperies. Before"]]]
