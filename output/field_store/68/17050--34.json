In _Dimetrodon_ the relationship of the dorsal surface of the palate  and the ventromedial surface of the mandible in front of the  articulation with the quadrate is unlike that in _Captorhinus_. When  the mandible of _Dimetrodon_ is at rest (adducted), a line drawn  between these two areas is oblique, between 30 and 40 degrees from the  horizontal. Depression of the mandible increases this angle. The  insertion of the anterior pterygoid is thus always considerably below  the origin, permitting the muscle to be active throughout the movement  of the mandible, from maximum depression to complete adduction. This  was a major factor in adding substantially to the speed and power of  the bite.    The presence and extent of a posterior pterygoid is more difficult to  assess, because of the closeness of the glenoid cavity and the raised  ridge of the prearticular, and the occupancy of at least part of this  region by the anterior pterygoid. In some specimens of _Dimetrodon_ the  internal process of the articular is double (see Romer and Price,  1940:87, Fig. 16) indicating that there was a double insertion here.  Whether the double insertion implies the insertion of two separate  muscles is, of course, the problem. Division of the pterygoid into  anterior and posterior portions is the reptilian pattern (Adams, 1919),  and such is adhered to here, with the posterior pterygoid arising as a  thin sheet from the quadrate wing of the pterygoid and the quadrate,  and inserting by means of a tendon on the internal process of the  articular, next to the insertion of the anterior pterygoid.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. _Dimetrodon._ Internal aspect of right cheek,  showing anterior and posterior pterygoid muscles. Skull modified from  Romer and Price (1940). Approx. x 1/4.]    Watson (1948) has reconstructed the musculature of the jaw in  _Dimetrodon_ with results that are at variance with those of the  present study. Watson recognized two divisions, an inner temporal and  an outer masseteric, of the capitimandibularis, but has pictured them  (830: Fig. 4; 831: Fig. 5C) as both arising from the inner surface of  the skull roof above the temporal opening. But in _Captorhinus_ the  masseter arose from the lower part of the cheek close to the outer  surface of the coronoid process. Watson has shown (1948:860, Fig. 17B)  the same relationship of muscle to zygoma in _Kannemeyeria sp._ It is  this arrangement that is also characteristic of mammals and presumably  of _Thrinaxodon_. In view of the consistency of this pattern, I have  reconstructed the masseter as arising from the lower wall of the cheek  beneath the temporal opening.    Watson's reconstruction shows both the temporal and masseter muscles as  being limited anteroposteriorly to an extent only slightly greater than  the anteroposterior diameter of the temporal opening. The whole of the  posterior half of the adductor chamber is unoccupied. More probably  this area was filled by muscles. The impress on the inner surface of  the cheek is evident, and the extent of both the coronoid process and  Meckelian opening beneath the rear part of the chamber indicate that  muscles passed through this area.    Watson remarked (1948:829-830) that the Meckelian opening in  _Dimetrodon_ \"is very narrow and the jaw cavity is very small. None the  less, it may have been occupied by the muscle or a ligament connected  to it. Such an insertion leaves unexplained the great dorsal production  of the dentary, surangular and coronoid. This may merely be a device to  provide great dorsal-ventral stiffness to the long jaw, but it is  possible and probable that some part of the temporal muscle was  inserted on the inner surface of the coronoid. Indeed a very  well-preserved jaw of _D. limbatus?_ (R. 105: Pl. I, Fig. 2) bears a  special depressed area on the outer surface of the extreme hinder end  of the dentary which differs in surface modelling from the rest of the  surface of the jaw, has a definite limit anteriorly, and may represent  a muscle insertion. The nature of these insertions suggests that the  muscle was already divided into two parts, an outer masseter and an  inner temporalis.\" But, unaccountably, Watson's illustration (1948:830,  Fig. 4) of his reconstruction limits the insertion of the temporal to  the anterior limit of the Meckelian opening and a part of the coronoid  process above it. No muscle is shown entering the Meckelian canal. It  seems more likely that the temporal entered and inserted in the canal  and on its dorsal lips. The masseter inserted lateral to it, over the  peak of the coronoid process, and overlapping onto the dorsalmost  portions of its external face, as Watson has illustrated (Plate I,  middle fig.).    I am in agreement with Watson's reconstruction of the origins for both  the anterior and posterior pterygoid muscles. On a functional basis,  however, I would modify slightly Watson's placement of the insertions  of these muscles. Watson believed that the jaw of _Dimetrodon_ was  capable of anteroposterior sliding. The articular surfaces of the jaws  of _Dimetrodon_ that I have examined indicate that this capability, if  present at all, was surely of a very limited degree, and in no way  comparable to that of _Captorhinus_. The dentition of _Dimetrodon_  further substantiates the movement of the jaw in a simple up and down  direction. The teeth of _Dimetrodon_ are clearly stabbing devices; they  are not modified at all for grinding and the correlative freedom of  movement of the jaw that that function requires in an animal such as  _Edaphosaurus_. Nor are they modified to parallel the teeth of  _Captorhinus_. The latter's diet is less certain, but presumably it was  insectivorous (Romer, 1928). With the requisite difference in levels of  origin and insertion of the anterior pterygoid in _Dimetrodon_ insuring  the application of force throughout the adduction of the jaws, it would  seem that the whole of the insertion should be shifted downward and  outward in the notch. If this change were made in the reconstruction,  the anterior pterygoid would have to be thought of as having arisen by  a tendon from the ridge that Watson has pictured (1948:828, Fig. 3) as  separating his origins for anterior and posterior pterygoids. The  posterior pterygoid, in turn, arose by tendons from the adjoining  lateral ridge and from the pterygoid process of Romer and Price.  Tendinous origins are indicated by the limitations of space in this  area, by the strength of the ridges pictured and reported by Watson,  and by the massiveness of the pterygoid process of Romer and Price.      Discussion    A comparison of the general pattern of the adductor musculature of  _Captorhinus_ and _Dimetrodon_ reveals an expected similarity. The  evidence indicates that the lateral and medial temporal masses were  present in both genera. The anterior pterygoid aided in initiating  adduction in _Captorhinus_, whereas in _Dimetrodon_ this muscle was  adductive throughout the swing of the jaw. Evidence for the presence  and extent of a pseudotemporal muscle in both _Captorhinus_ and  _Dimetrodon_ is lacking. The posterior division of the pterygoid is  small in _Captorhinus_. In _Dimetrodon_ this muscle has been  reconstructed by Watson as a major adductor, an arrangement that is  adhered to here with but slight modification.    The dentition of _Captorhinus_ suggests that the jaw movement in  feeding was more complex than the simple depression and adduction that  was probably characteristic of _Dimetrodon_ and supports the  osteological evidence for a relatively complex adductor mechanism.    In _Captorhinus_ the presence of an overlapping premaxillary beak  bearing teeth that are slanted posteriorly requires that the mandible  be drawn back in order to be depressed. Conversely, during closure, the  jaw must be pulled forward to complete full adduction. The  quadrate-articular joint is flat enough to permit such anteroposterior  sliding movements. The relationship of the origin and insertion of the  anterior pterygoid indicates that this muscle, ineffective in  maintaining adduction, may well have acted to pull the mandible  forward, in back of the premaxillary beak, in the last stages of  adduction. Abrasion of the sides of the inner maxillary and outer  dentary teeth indicates that tooth-to-tooth contact did occur. Whether  such abrasion was due to contact in simple vertical adduction or in  anteroposterior sliding is impossible to determine, but the evidence  considered above indicates the latter probability.    Similarities of _Protorothyris_ to sphenacodont pelycosaurs in the  shape of the skull and palate already commented upon by Watson (1954)  and Hotton (1961) suggest that the condition of the adductors in  _Dimetrodon_ is a retention of the primitive reptilian pattern, with  modifications mainly limited to an increase in size of the temporalis.  _Captorhinus_, however, seems to have departed rather radically from  the primitive pattern, developing specializations of the adductors that  are correlated with the flattening of the skull, the peculiar marginal  and anterior dentition, the modifications of the quadrate-articular  joint, and the development of the coronoid process.      Thrinaxodon    The evidence for the position and extent of the external adductors of  the lower jaw in _Thrinaxodon_ was secured in part from dissections of  _Didelphis marsupialis_, the Virginia opossum. Moreover, comparison of  the two genera reveals striking similarities in the shape and spatial  relationships of the external adductors. These are compared below in  some detail.    The sagittal crest in _Thrinaxodon_ is present but low. It arises  immediately in front of the pineal foramen from the confluence of  bilateral ridges that extend posteriorly and medially from the base of  the postorbital"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#3)"],[1,"was admitted as a free State  in the following year.    With the admission of Arkansas and Michigan, thirteen slave States were  balanced by a like number of free States. The South still had Florida,  which would in time become a slave State. Against this single Territory  there was an immense region to the northwest, equal in area to all the  slave States combined, which, according to the Ordinance of 1787 and the  Missouri Compromise, had been consecrated to freedom. Foreseeing this  condition, a few Southern planters began a movement for the extension  of territory to the south and west immediately after the adoption of  the Missouri Compromise. When Arkansas was admitted in 1836, there was a  prospect of the immediate annexation of Texas as a slave State. This did  not take place until nine years later, but the propaganda, the object of  which was the extension of slave territory, could not be maintained by  those who contended that slavery was a curse to the country. Virginia,  therefore, and other border slave States, as they became committed to  the policy of expansion, ceased to tolerate official public utterances  against slavery.    Three more or less clearly defined sections appear in the later  development of the crusade. These are the New England States, the Middle  States, and the States south of North Carolina and Tennessee. In New  England, few negroes were ever held as slaves, and the institution  disappeared during the first years of the Republic. The inhabitants had  little experience arising from actual contact with slavery. When slavery  disappeared from New England and before there had been developed in the  country at large a national feeling of responsibility for its continued  existence, interest in the subject declined. For twenty years previous  to the founding of Garrison's Liberator in 1831, organized abolition  movements had been almost unknown in New England. In various ways  the people were isolated, separated from contact with slavery. Their  knowledge of this subject of discussion was academic, theoretical,  acquired at second-hand.    In New York and New Jersey slaves were much more numerous than in New  England. There were still slaves in considerable numbers until about  1825. The people had a knowledge of the institution from experience and  observation, and there was no break in the continuity of their organized  abolition societies. Chief among the objects of these societies was the  effort to prevent kidnapping and to guard the rights of free negroes.  For both of these purposes there was a continuous call for activity.  Pennsylvania also had freedmen of her own whose rights called for  guardianship, as well as many freedmen from farther south who had come  into the State.    The movement of protest and protection did not stop at Mason and Dixon's  Line, but extended far into the South. In both North Carolina and  Tennessee an active protest against slavery was at all times maintained.  In this great middle section of the country, between New England and  South Carolina, there was no cessation in the conflict between free  and slave labor. Some of these States became free while others remained  slave; but between the people of the two sections there was continuous  communication. Slaveholders came into free States to liberate their  slaves. Non-slaveholders came to get rid of the competition of slave  labor, and free negroes came to avoid reenslavement. Slaves fled thither  on their way to liberty. It was not a matter of choice; it was an  unavoidable condition which compelled the people of the border States to  give continuous attention to the institution of slavery.    The modern anti-slavery movement had its origin in this great middle  section, and from the same source it derived its chief support. The  great body of active abolitionists were from the slave States or  else derived their inspiration from personal contact with slavery. As  compared with New England abolitionists, the middlestate folk were  less extreme in their views. They had a keener appreciation of the  difficulties involved in emancipation. They were more tolerant towards  the idea of letting the country at large share the burdens involved  in the liberation of the slaves. Border-state abolitionists naturally  favored the policy of gradual emancipation which had been followed in  New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Abolitionists who continued  to reside in the slave States were forced to recognize the fact that  emancipation involved serious questions of race adjustment. From  the border States came the colonization society, a characteristic  institution, as well as compromise of every variety.    The southernmost section, including South Carolina, Georgia, and the  Gulf States, was even more sharply defined in the attitude it  assumed toward the anti-slavery movement. At no time did the cause of  emancipation become formidable in this section. In all these States  there was, of course, a large class of non-slaveholding whites, who  were opposed to slavery and who realized that they were victims of an  injurious system; but they had no effective organ for expression. The  ruling minority gained an early and an easy victory and to the end held  a firm hand. To the inhabitants of this section it appeared to be a  self-evident truth that the white race was born to rule and the black  race was born to serve. Where negroes outnumbered the whites fourfold,  the mere suggestion of emancipation raised a race question which seemed  appalling in its proportions. Either in the Union or out of the Union,  the rulers were determined to perpetuate slavery.    Slavery as an economic institution became dependent upon a few  semitropical plantation crops. When the Constitution was framed, rice  and indigo, produced in South Carolina and Georgia, were the two most  important. Indigo declined in relative importance, and the production  of sugar was developed, especially after the annexation of the Louisiana  Purchase. But by far the most important crop for its effects upon  slavery and upon the entire country was cotton. This single product  finally absorbed the labor of half the slaves of the entire country. Mr.  Rhodes is not at all unreasonable in his surmise that, had it not been  for the unforeseen development of the cotton industry, the expectation  of the founders of the Republic that slavery would soon disappear would  actually have been realized.    It was more difficult to carry out a policy of emancipation when slaves  were quoted in the market at a thousand dollars than when the price  was a few hundred dollars. All slave-owners felt richer; emancipation  appeared to involve a greater sacrifice. Thus the cotton industry went  far towards accounting for the changed attitude of the entire country  on the subject of slavery. The North as well as the South became  financially interested.    It was not generally perceived before it actually happened that the  border States would take the place of Africa in furnishing the required  supply of laborers for Southern plantations. The interstate slave-trade  gave to the system a solidarity of interest which was new. All  slave-owners became partakers of a common responsibility for the system  as a whole. It was the newly developed trade quite as much as the system  of slavery itself which furnished the ground for the later anti-slavery  appeal. The consciousness of a common guilt for the sin of slavery grew  with the increase of actual interstate relations.    The abolition of the African slave-trade was an act of the general  Government. Congress passed the prohibitory statute in 1807, to go into  effect January, 1808. At no time, however, was the prohibition entirely  effective, and a limited illegal trade continued until slavery was  eventually abolished. This inefficiency of restraint furnished another  point of attack for the abolitionists. Through efforts to suppress the  African slave-trade, the entire country became conscious of a common  responsibility. Before the Revolutionary War, Great Britain had been  censured for forcing cheap slaves from Africa upon her unwilling  colonies. After the Revolution, New England was blamed for the activity  of her citizens in this nefarious trade both before and after it was  made illegal. All of this tended to increase the sense of responsibility  in every section of the country. Congress had made the foreign  slave-trade illegal; and citizens in all sections gradually became  aware of the possibility that Congress might likewise restrict or forbid  interstate commerce in slaves.    The West Indies and Mexico were also closely associated with the United  States in the matter of slavery. When Jamestown was founded, negro  slavery was already an old institution in the islands of the Caribbean  Sea, and thence came the first slaves to Virginia. The abolition of  slavery in the island of Hayti, or San Domingo, was accomplished during  the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. As incidental to the  process of emancipation, the Caucasian inhabitants were massacred  or banished, and a republican government was established, composed  exclusively of negroes and mulattoes. From the date of the Missouri  Compromise to that of the Mexican War, this island was united under a  single republic, though it was afterwards divided into the two republics  of Hayti and San Domingo.    The \"horrors of San Domingo\" were never absent from the minds of those  in the United States who lived in communities composed chiefly of  slaves. What had happened on the island was accepted by Southern  planters as proof that the two races could live together in peace only  under the relation of master and slave, and that emancipation boded  the extermination of one race or the other. Abolitionists, however,  interpreted the facts differently: they emphasized the tyranny of the  white rulers as a primary cause of the massacres; they endowed"]]]
