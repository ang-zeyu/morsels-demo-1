Thou sawest, Lord,  how while yet a boy, being seized on a time with sudden oppression of  the stomach, and like near to death--Thou sawest, my God (for Thou wert  my keeper), with what eagerness and what faith I sought, from the pious  care of my mother and Thy Church, the mother of us all, the baptism of  Thy Christ, my God and Lord. Whereupon the mother of my flesh, being  much troubled (since, with a heart pure in Thy faith, she even more  lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation), would in eager haste  have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the health-giving  sacraments, confessing Thee, Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins,  unless I had suddenly recovered. And so, as if I must needs be  again polluted should I live, my cleansing was deferred, because the  defilements of sin would, after that washing, bring greater and more  perilous guilt. I then already believed: and my mother, and the whole  household, except my father: yet did not he prevail over the power of my  mother's piety in me, that as he did not yet believe, so neither  should I. For it was her earnest care that Thou my God, rather than he,  shouldest be my father; and in this Thou didst aid her to prevail over  her husband, whom she, the better, obeyed, therein also obeying Thee,  who hast so commanded.      I beseech Thee, my God, I would fain know, if so Thou willest, for  what purpose my baptism was then deferred? was it for my good that the  rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to sin? or was it not  laid loose? If not, why does it still echo in our ears on all sides,  \"Let him alone, let him do as he will, for he is not yet baptised?\" but  as to bodily health, no one says, \"Let him be worse wounded, for he is  not yet healed.\" How much better then, had I been at once healed; and  then, by my friends' and my own, my soul's recovered health had been  kept safe in Thy keeping who gavest it. Better truly. But how many and  great waves of temptation seemed to hang over me after my boyhood! These  my mother foresaw; and preferred to expose to them the clay whence I  might afterwards be moulded, than the very cast, when made.      In boyhood itself, however (so much less dreaded for me than youth),  I loved not study, and hated to be forced to it. Yet I was forced; and  this was well done towards me, but I did not well; for, unless forced, I  had not learnt. But no one doth well against his will, even though what  he doth, be well. Yet neither did they well who forced me, but what was  well came to me from Thee, my God. For they were regardless how I should  employ what they forced me to learn, except to satiate the insatiate  desires of a wealthy beggary, and a shameful glory. But Thou, by whom  the very hairs of our head are numbered, didst use for my good the error  of all who urged me to learn; and my own, who would not learn, Thou  didst use for my punishment--a fit penalty for one, so small a boy and  so great a sinner. So by those who did not well, Thou didst well for me;  and by my own sin Thou didst justly punish me. For Thou hast commanded,  and so it is, that every inordinate affection should be its own  punishment.    But why did I so much hate the Greek, which I studied as a boy? I do not  yet fully know. For the Latin I loved; not what my first masters, but  what the so-called grammarians taught me. For those first lessons,  reading, writing and arithmetic, I thought as great a burden and penalty  as any Greek. And yet whence was this too, but from the sin and vanity  of this life, because I was flesh, and a breath that passeth away and  cometh not again? For those first lessons were better certainly, because  more certain; by them I obtained, and still retain, the power of reading  what I find written, and myself writing what I will; whereas in the  others, I was forced to learn the wanderings of one Aeneas, forgetful of  my own, and to weep for dead Dido, because she killed herself for love;  the while, with dry eyes, I endured my miserable self dying among these  things, far from Thee, O God my life.    For what more miserable than a miserable being who commiserates not  himself; weeping the death of Dido for love to Aeneas, but weeping not  his own death for want of love to Thee, O God. Thou light of my heart,  Thou bread of my inmost soul, Thou Power who givest vigour to my mind,  who quickenest my thoughts, I loved Thee not. I committed fornication  against Thee, and all around me thus fornicating there echoed \"Well  done! well done!\" for the friendship of this world is fornication  against Thee; and \"Well done! well done!\" echoes on till one is ashamed  not to be thus a man. And for all this I wept not, I who wept for Dido  slain, and \"seeking by the sword a stroke and wound extreme,\" myself  seeking the while a worse extreme, the extremest and lowest of Thy  creatures, having forsaken Thee, earth passing into the earth. And  if forbid to read all this, I was grieved that I might not read what  grieved me. Madness like this is thought a higher and a richer learning,  than that by which I learned to read and write.    But now, my God, cry Thou aloud in my soul; and let Thy truth tell me,  \"Not so, not so. Far better was that first study.\" For, lo, I would  readily forget the wanderings of Aeneas and all the rest, rather than  how to read and write. But over the entrance of the Grammar School is a  vail drawn! true; yet is this not so much an emblem of aught recondite,  as a cloak of error. Let not those, whom I no longer fear, cry out  against me, while I confess to Thee, my God, whatever my soul will, and  acquiesce in the condemnation of my evil ways, that I may love Thy  good ways. Let not either buyers or sellers of grammar-learning cry out  against me. For if I question them whether it be true that Aeneas came  on a time to Carthage, as the poet tells, the less learned will reply  that they know not, the more learned that he never did. But should I ask  with what letters the name \"Aeneas\" is written, every one who has  learnt this will answer me aright, as to the signs which men have  conventionally settled. If, again, I should ask which might be forgotten  with least detriment to the concerns of life, reading and writing or  these poetic fictions? who does not foresee what all must answer who  have not wholly forgotten themselves? I sinned, then, when as a boy I  preferred those empty to those more profitable studies, or rather loved  the one and hated the other. \"One and one, two\"; \"two and two, four\";  this was to me a hateful singsong: \"the wooden horse lined with  armed men,\" and \"the burning of Troy,\" and \"Creusa's shade and sad  similitude,\" were the choice spectacle of my vanity.    Why then did I hate the Greek classics, which have the like tales? For  Homer also curiously wove the like fictions, and is most sweetly vain,  yet was he bitter to my boyish taste. And so I suppose would Virgil  be to Grecian children, when forced to learn him as I was Homer.  Difficulty, in truth, the difficulty of a foreign tongue, dashed, as it  were, with gall all the sweetness of Grecian fable. For not one word of  it did I understand, and to make me understand I was urged vehemently  with cruel threats and punishments. Time was also (as an infant) I  knew no Latin; but this I learned without fear or suffering, by mere  observation, amid the caresses of my nursery and jests of friends,  smiling and sportively encouraging me. This I learned without any  pressure of punishment to urge me on, for my heart urged me to give  birth to its conceptions, which I could only do by learning words not of  those who taught, but of those who talked with me; in whose ears also I  gave birth to the thoughts, whatever I conceived. No doubt, then, that  a free curiosity has more force in our learning these things, than a  frightful enforcement. Only this enforcement restrains the rovings of  that freedom, through Thy laws, O my God, Thy laws, from the master's  cane to the martyr's trials, being able to temper for us a wholesome  bitter, recalling us to Thyself from that deadly pleasure which lures us  from Thee.    Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline, nor  let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies, whereby Thou  hast drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest become a  delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued; that I may  most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my affections, and  Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end. For  lo, O Lord, my King and my God, for Thy service be whatever useful  thing my childhood learned; for Thy service, that I speak, write, read,  reckon. For Thou didst grant me Thy discipline, while I was learning  vanities; and my sin of delighting in those vanities Thou hast forgiven.  In them, indeed, I learnt many a useful word, but these may as well be  learned in things not vain; and that is the safe path for the steps of  youth.    But woe is thee, thou torrent of human custom! Who shall stand against  thee? how long shalt thou not be dried up? how long roll the sons of Eve  into that huge and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely overpass who  climb the cross? Did not I read in thee of Jove the thunderer and the  adulterer? both, doubtless, he could not be; but so the feigned thunder  might countenance and pander to real adultery. And now which of our  gowned masters lends a sober ear to one who from their own school cries  out, \"These were Homer's fictions, transferring things human to the  gods; would he had brought down things divine to us!\" Yet more truly had  he said, \"These are indeed his fictions; but attributing a divine nature  to wicked men, that crimes might be no longer crimes, and whoso commits  them might seem to imitate not abandoned men, but the celestial gods.\"    And yet, thou "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32962"],[0,"A Handbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing (#3)"],[1,"but little difficulty. It is made in three stages as shown in Fig. 5,  and the procedure is similar to that used in joining a large and small  tube. Care should be taken to avoid softening the top of the \"T\" too  much, or the glass will bend and distort the finished work; although a  slight bend can be rectified by re-heating and bending back. Local  re-heating is often useful in giving the joint its final shape.    An exhaustion branch is often made by a totally different method. This  method is shown by _g_, _h_, and _i_, Fig. 5; _g_ is the tube on which  the branch is to be made. The end of a rod of similar glass should be  heated until a mass of thoroughly liquid glass has collected, as shown,  and at the same time a spot should be heated on that part of the tube  where it is desired to make the branch. The mass of hot glass on the rod  is now brought in contact with the heated spot on the tube and expanded  by blowing as shown by _h_. The air pressure in the tube is still  maintained while the rod is drawn away as shown by _i_. This will give a  hollow branch which may be cut off at any desired point, and is then  ready for connection to the vacuum pump.    If the rod used is of a dissimilar glass, the branch should be blown  much thinner. Such a branch will often serve as a useful basis for  joining two tubes of different composition, as the ordinary type of  branch is more liable to crack when made with two glasses having  different coefficients of expansion.    _Blowing Bulbs._--A bulb may be blown on a closed tube such as that  shown by _c_, Fig. 5, by rotating it in the blowpipe flame until the end  is softened, removing it from the flame and blowing cautiously. It is  desirable to continue the rotation during blowing. In the case of a very  small tube, it is sufficient to melt the end without previous sealing,  rotate it in the flame until enough glass has collected, remove from the  flame and blow while keeping the tube in rotation.    _Thermometer Bulbs._--If the thermometer is to be filled with mercury,  it is desirable to use a rubber bulb for blowing, as moisture is liable  to condense inside the tube when the mouth is used, and this moisture  will cause the mercury thread to break. In any case, a slight pressure  should be maintained inside the thermometer tube while it is in the  flame; otherwise the fine capillary tube will close and it will be very  difficult to expand the heated glass into a bulb.    _Large Bulbs._--When a large bulb is needed on a small or medium sized  tube, it is often necessary to provide more glass than would be obtained  if the bulb were blown in the ordinary way. One method is to expand the  tube in successive stages along its axis, as shown by _a_, Fig. 6. These  expanded portions are then re-heated, so that they run together into one  hollow mass from which the bulb is blown; _b_ and _c_, illustrate this.  Another method, and one which is useful for very large bulbs, is to  fuse on a length of large, thick-walled, tubing. The heat reflector,  _g_, Fig. 3, should be used, if necessary, when making large bulbs. It  consists of a sheet of asbestos mounted in a foot, and is used by being  placed close to the mass of glass on the side away from the blowpipe  flame while the glass is being heated.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    _Bulbs of Dissimilar Glass._--These may be made by the second method  given under \"Large Bulbs,\" but the joint should be blown as thin as  possible. Further instructions in the use of unlike glasses are given on  page 94.    _A Bulb in the Middle of a Tube._--Unless the bulb is to be quite small,  it will be necessary to join in a piece of thick glass tubing, or to  draw the thin tube out from a larger piece, thus leaving a thick mass in  the middle as shown by _d_, Fig. 6. This mass of glass should now be  rotated in the blowpipe flame until it is quite soft and on the point of  running together. Considerable practice will be necessary before the two  ends of the tube can be rotated at the same speed and without  \"wobbling,\" but this power must be acquired. When the glass is  thoroughly hot, remove from the flame, hold in a horizontal position,  and expand by blowing. It is essential to continue the rotation while  this is done. Should one part of the bulb tend to expand more than the  other, turn the expanded part to the bottom, pause for about a second,  both in rotating and blowing, in order that the lower portion may be  cooled by ascending air-currents; then continue blowing and turning as  before.    _Absorption Bulbs or Washing Bulbs._--These are made by an elaboration  of the processes given in the last paragraph, _g_, _h_, and _i_, Fig. 6,  illustrate this.    _A Thistle Funnel._--This is made by blowing a fairly thick-walled bulb  on a glass tube, bursting a hole by heating and blowing, and enlarging  the burst-out part by heating and rotating against a turn-pin.    _Bending Glass Tube._--Small tubing may be bent in a flat flame gas  burner and offers no special difficulty. Large or thin-walled tubing  should be heated in the blowpipe flame and a slight bend made; another  zone of the tube, just touching the first bend, should now be heated and  another slight bend made. In this way it is possible to avoid flattening  and a bend having any required angle can gradually be produced. A final  shaping of the bend may be made by heating in a large blowpipe flame and  expanding slightly by air pressure.    _Glass Spirals._--If a tube is heated by means of a long, flat-flame  burner, the softened tube may be wound on to an iron mandrel which has  previously been covered with asbestos. The mandrel should be made  slightly conical in order to facilitate withdrawal. It is desirable to  heat the surface of the asbestos almost to redness by means of a second  burner, and thus avoid undue chilling of the glass and the consequent  production of internal strain.    [Illustration: Fig. 7]    _A Thermo-Regulator for Gas._--Fig. 7, _a-e_, shows an easily  constructed thermo-regulator. The mercury reservoir, _a_, and the upper  part, _b_, are made by joining two larger pieces of tubing on to the  capillary. The gas inlet passes through a rubber stopper, in order to  allow of adjustment for depth of insertion, and the bye-pass branches,  _d_ and _e_, are connected by a piece of rubber tubing which can be  compressed by means of a screw clip, thus providing a means of  regulating the bye-pass.    _Use of Glass Rod._--Apart from its most common laboratory use for  stirring; glass rod may be used in building up such articles as  insulating feet for electrical apparatus or acid-resisting cages for  chemical purposes. Such a cage is shown by _f_, _g_ and _h_, Fig. 7.  Further, by an elaboration of the method of making an exhaustion branch,  given on page 18, blown articles may also be constructed from rod. Note  the added parts of _e_, Fig. 9.    _A Simple Foot._--The form of foot shown by Fig. 7, _k_, is easy to make  and has many uses. First join a glass rod to a length of glass tubing as  shown (the joint should be expanded slightly by blowing), cut off the  tube and heat the piece remaining on the rod until it can be turned out  as shown by _i_. This should be done with the large turn-pin, and care  should be taken not to heat the supporting rod too strongly, otherwise  the piece of tube will become bent and distorted; it is better to  commence by heating the edge of the piece of tube and turn out a lip,  then extend the heating by degrees and turn out more and more until the  foot looks like that shown by _i_.    We now need to make three projections of glass rod. These are produced  as follows:--Heat the end of the glass rod until a thoroughly melted  mass of glass has accumulated (the rod must be rotated while this is  being done, otherwise the glass will drop off); when sufficient melted  glass has been obtained, the edge of the turned-out foot should be  heated to dull redness over about one-third of its circumference, and  the melted glass on the rod should be drawn along the heated portion  until both are so completely in contact as to form one mass of  semi-fluid glass. The rod should now be drawn away slowly, and, finally,  separated by melting off, thus producing a flat projection. A repetition  of the process will give the other two projections, and the finished  foot may be adjusted to stand upright by heating the projections  slightly and standing it on the carbon plate mentioned on page 7. After  the foot is adjusted it should be annealed slightly by heating to just  below the softening point of the glass and then rotating in a smoky gas  flame until it is covered with a deposit of carbon, after which it  should be allowed to cool in a place free from draughts and where the  hot glass will not come in contact with anything. The finished foot is  shown by _k_, Fig. 7.    _Building up from Glass Rod._--A glass skeleton-work can be constructed  from rod without much difficulty, and is sometimes useful as a container  for a substance which has to be treated with acid, or for similar  purposes. The method is almost sufficiently explained by the  illustration in Fig. 7; _f_ shows the initial stage, _g_ the method of  construction of the net-work, and _h_ the finished container. It is  convenient to introduce the substance at the stage indicated by _g_. The  important points to observe in making this contrivance are that the  glass rod must be kept hot by working while it is actually in the flame,  and that the skeleton must be made as thin as possible with the  avoidance of heavy masses of glass at any place. If these details are  neglected it will be almost certain to crack.    _Stirrers._--These are usually made from glass rod, and no special  instructions are necessary for their construction, except that the glass  should be in a thoroughly fused condition before making any joins and  the finished join should be annealed slightly by"]]]
