Returning from school one day, I met my mother just setting out for the  meeting, and I begged her to let me go along. She consented, and without  stopping to lay my books down I scampered away in my mother's wake. The  speeches interested and excited me, especially the address of the great  Miss Lydia Becker, who was the Susan B. Anthony of the English movement,  a splendid character and a truly eloquent speaker. She was the secretary  of the Manchester committee, and I had learned to admire her as the  editor of the _Women's Suffrage Journal_, which came to my mother every  week. I left the meeting a conscious and confirmed suffragist.    I suppose I had always been an unconscious suffragist. With my  temperament and my surroundings I could scarcely have been otherwise.  The movement was very much alive in the early seventies, nowhere more so  than in Manchester, where it was organised by a group of extraordinary  men and women. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Bright, who were  always ready to champion the struggling cause. Mr. Jacob Bright, a  brother of John Bright, was for many years member of Parliament for  Manchester, and to the day of his death was an active supporter of woman  suffrage. Two especially gifted women, besides Miss Becker, were members  of the committee. These were Mrs. Alice Cliff Scatcherd and Miss  Wolstentholm, now the venerable Mrs. Wolstentholm-Elmy. One of the  principal founders of the committee was the man whose wife, in later  years, I was destined to become, Dr. Richard Marsden Pankhurst.    When I was fifteen years old I went to Paris, where I was entered as a  pupil in one of the pioneer institutions in Europe for the higher  education of girls. This school, one of the founders of which was Madame  Edmond Adam, who was and is still a distinguished literary figure, was  situated in a fine old house in the Avenue de Neuilly. It was under the  direction of Mlle. Marchef-Girard, a woman distinguished in education,  and who afterward was appointed government inspector of schools in  France. Mlle. Marchef-Girard believed that girls' education should be  quite as thorough and even more practical than the education boys were  receiving at that time. She included chemistry and other sciences in her  courses, and in addition to embroidery she had her girls taught  bookkeeping. Many other advanced ideas prevailed in this school, and the  moral discipline which the pupils received was, to my mind, as valuable  as the intellectual training. Mlle. Marchef-Girard held that women  should be given the highest ideals of honour. Her pupils were kept to  the strictest principles of truth-telling and candour. Myself she  understood and greatly benefited by an implicit trust which I am sure I  could not have betrayed, even had I felt for her less real affection.    My roommate in this delightful school was an interesting young girl of  my own age, Noemie Rochefort, daughter of that great Republican,  Communist, journalist, and swordsman, Henri Rochefort. This was very  shortly after the Franco-Prussian War, and memories of the Empire's  fall and of the bloody and disastrous Commune were very keen in Paris.  Indeed my roommate's illustrious father and many others were then in  exile in New Caledonia for participation in the Commune. My friend  Noemie was torn with anxiety for her father. She talked of him  constantly, and many were the blood-curdling accounts of daring and of  patriotism to which I listened. Henri Rochefort was, in fact, one of the  moving spirits of the Republican movement in France, and after his  amazing escape in an open boat from New Caledonia, he lived through many  years of political adventures of the most lively and picturesque  character. His daughter and I remained warm friends long after our  school-days ended, and my association with her strengthened all the  liberal ideas I had previously acquired.    I was between eighteen and nineteen when I finally returned from school  in Paris and took my place in my father's home as a finished young lady.  I sympathised with and worked for the woman-suffrage movement, and came  to know Dr. Pankhurst, whose work for woman suffrage had never ceased.  It was Dr. Pankhurst who drafted the first enfranchisement bill, known  as the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill, and introduced into the House  of Commons in 1870 by Mr. Jacob Bright. The bill advanced to its second  reading by a majority vote of thirty-three, but it was killed in  committee by Mr. Gladstone's peremptory orders. Dr. Pankhurst, as I have  already said, with another distinguished barrister, Lord Coleridge,  acted as counsel for the Manchester women, who tried in 1868 to be  placed on the register as voters. He also drafted the bill giving  married women absolute control over their property and earnings, a bill  which became law in 1882.    My marriage with Dr. Pankhurst took place in 1879.    I think we cannot be too grateful to the group of men and women who,  like Dr. Pankhurst, in those early days lent the weight of their  honoured names to the suffrage movement in the trials of its struggling  youth. These men did not wait until the movement became popular, nor did  they hesitate until it was plain that women were roused to the point of  revolt. They worked all their lives with those who were organising,  educating, and preparing for the revolt which was one day to come.  Unquestionably those pioneer men suffered in popularity for their  feminist views. Some of them suffered financially, some politically. Yet  they never wavered.    My married life lasted through nineteen happy years. Often I have heard  the taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal  outlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed  beings. This is probably not true of any suffragist, and it is most  certainly not true of me. My home life and relations have been as nearly  ideal as possible in this imperfect world. About a year after my  marriage my daughter Christabel was born, and in another eighteen months  my second daughter Sylvia came. Two other children followed, and for  some years I was rather deeply immersed in my domestic affairs.    I was never so absorbed with home and children, however, that I lost  interest in community affairs. Dr. Pankhurst did not desire that I  should turn myself into a household machine. It was his firm belief that  society as well as the family stands in need of women's services. So  while my children were still in their cradles I was serving on the  executive committee of the Women's Suffrage Society, and also on the  executive board of the committee which was working to secure the Married  Women's Property Act. This act having passed in 1882, I threw myself  into the suffrage work with renewed energy. A new Reform Act, known as  the County Franchise Bill, extending the suffrage to farm labourers, was  under discussion, and we believed that our years of educational  propaganda work had prepared the country to support us in a demand for a  women's suffrage amendment to the bill. For several years we had been  holding the most splendid meetings in cities all over the kingdom. The  crowds, the enthusiasm, the generous response to appeals for support,  all these seemed to justify us in our belief that women's suffrage was  near. In fact, in 1884, when the County Franchise Bill came before the  country, we had an actual majority in favour of suffrage in the House of  Commons.    But a favourable majority in the House of Commons by no means insures  the success of any measure. I shall explain this at length when I come  to our work of opposing candidates who have avowed themselves  suffragists, a course which has greatly puzzled our American friends.  The Liberal party was in power in 1884, and a great memorial was sent  to the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable William E. Gladstone, asking  that a women's suffrage amendment to the County Franchise Bill be  submitted to the free and unbiased consideration of the House. Mr.  Gladstone curtly refused, declaring that if a women's suffrage amendment  should be carried, the Government would disclaim responsibility for the  bill. The amendment was submitted nevertheless, but Mr. Gladstone would  not allow it to be freely discussed, and he ordered Liberal members to  vote against it. What we call a whip was sent out against it, a note  virtually commanding party members to be on hand at a certain hour to  vote against the women's amendment. Undismayed, the women tried to have  an independent suffrage bill introduced, but Mr. Gladstone so arranged  Parliamentary business that the bill never even came up for discussion.    I am not going to write a history of the woman suffrage movement in  England prior to 1903, when the Women's Social and Political Union was  organised. That history is full of repetitions of just such stories as  the one I have related. Gladstone was an implacable foe of woman  suffrage. He believed that women's work and politics lay in service to  men's parties. One of the shrewdest acts of Mr. Gladstone's career was  his disruption of the suffrage organisation in England. He accomplished  this by substituting \"something just as good,\" that something being  Women's Liberal Associations. Beginning in 1881 in Bristol, these  associations spread rapidly through the country and, in 1887, became a  National Women's Liberal Federation. The promise of the Federation was  that by allying themselves with men in party politics, women would soon  earn the right to vote. The avidity with which the women swallowed this  promise, left off working for themselves, and threw themselves into the  men's work was amazing.    The Women's Liberal Federation is an organisation of women who believe  in the principles of the Liberal party. (The somewhat older Primrose  League is a similar organisation of women who adhere to Conservative  party"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#3)"],[1,"individual had no absolute rights against Society.  The eighteenth century view is that individuals existed first, each with  their own special claims and responsibilities; that they deliberately  formed a Social State, either by a contract or otherwise; and that then  finally they limited their own action out of regard for the interests of  the social organism thus arbitrarily produced. This is hardly the view  of the nineteenth century. It is possible that logically the individual  is prior to the State; historically and in the order of Nature, the  State is prior to the individual. In other words, such rights as every  single personality possesses in a modern world do not belong to him by  an original ordinance of Nature, but are slowly acquired in the growth  and development of the social state. It is not the truth that individual  liberties were forfeited by some deliberate act when men made themselves  into a Commonwealth. It is more true to say, as Aristotle said long ago,  that man is naturally a political animal, that he lived under strict  social laws as a mere item, almost a nonentity, as compared with the  Order, Society, or Community to which he belonged, and that such  privileges as he subsequently acquired have been obtained in virtue of  his growing importance as a member of a growing organisation. But if  this is even approximately true, it seriously restricts that liberty of  the individual for which Mill pleads. The individual has no chance,  because he has no rights, against the social organism. Society can  punish him for acts or even opinions which are anti-social in character.  His virtue lies in recognising the intimate communion with his fellows.  His sphere of activity is bounded by the common interest. Just as it is  an absurd and exploded theory that all men are originally equal, so it  is an ancient and false doctrine to protest that a man has an individual  liberty to live and think as he chooses in any spirit of antagonism to  that larger body of which he forms an insignificant part.    Nowadays this view of Society and of its development, which we largely  owe to the _Philosophie Positive_ of M. Auguste Comte, is so familiar  and possibly so damaging to the individual initiative, that it becomes  necessary to advance and proclaim the truth which resides in an opposite  theory. All progress, as we are aware, depends on the joint process of  integration and differentiation; synthesis, analysis, and then a larger  synthesis seem to form the law of development. If it ever comes to pass  that Society is tyrannical in its restrictions of the individual, if, as  for instance in some forms of Socialism, based on deceptive analogies of  Nature's dealings, the type is everything and the individual nothing, it  must be confidently urged in answer that the fuller life of the future  depends on the manifold activities, even though they may be  antagonistic, of the individual. In England, at all events, we know that  government in all its different forms, whether as King, or as a caste  of nobles, or as an oligarchical plutocracy, or even as trades unions,  is so dwarfing in its action that, for the sake of the future, the  individual must revolt. Just as our former point of view limited the  value of Mill's treatise on _Liberty_, so these considerations tend to  show its eternal importance. The omnipotence of Society means a dead  level of uniformity. The claim of the individual to be heard, to say  what he likes, to do what he likes, to live as he likes, is absolutely  necessary, not only for the variety of elements without which life is  poor, but also for the hope of a future age. So long as individual  initiative and effort are recognised as a vital element in English  history, so long will Mill's _Liberty_, which he confesses was based on  a suggestion derived from Von Humboldt, remain as an indispensable  contribution to the speculations, and also to the health and sanity, of  the world.      What his wife really was to Mill, we shall, perhaps, never know. But  that she was an actual and vivid force, which roused the latent  enthusiasm of his nature, we have abundant evidence. And when she died  at Avignon, though his friends may have regained an almost estranged  companionship, Mill was, personally, the poorer. Into the sorrow of that  bereavement we cannot enter: we have no right or power to draw the veil.  It is enough to quote the simple words, so eloquent of an unspoken  grief--\"I can say nothing which could describe, even in the faintest  manner, what that loss was and is. But because I know that she would  have wished it, I endeavour to make the best of what life I have left,  and to work for her purposes with such diminished strength as can be  derived from thoughts of her, and communion with her memory.\"      W.

ON LIBERTY.          CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY.      The subject of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, so  unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical  Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the  power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the  individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in  general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical  controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to  make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far  from being new, that in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost  from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more  civilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself  under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental  treatment.    The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous  feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar,  particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this  contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the  government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the  political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the  popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position  to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a  governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance  or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the  governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not  desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its  oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as  highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against  their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the  weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable  vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey  stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king  of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any  of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude  of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots,  was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to  exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by  liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition  of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it  was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and  which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was  held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was  the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the  community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its  interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important  acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation,  the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or  less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or  when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely,  became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so  long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be  ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less  efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations  beyond this point.    A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased  to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an  independent power, opposed in interest to themselves. It appeared to  them much better that the various magistrates of the State should be  their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. In that way  alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that"]]]
