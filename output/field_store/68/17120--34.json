Besides, as you  say, we can hire a man or two to help, and shall have some money to fall  back upon until things begin to pay. There are plenty of women who  manage even without the assistance of a son, and I do not know why I  should not be able to get on with you and Marion to help me, especially  as farming is a comparatively simple business, in a new country. At any  rate, as you say, with two or three cows and plenty of ducks and hens,  and what we can grow on the ground, there will be no fear of our  starving.\"    The next day Mr. Renshaw came downstairs for the first time since he had  heard of the misfortune. He had received a letter that morning saying  that a call was at once to be made on each shareholder for the amount  still standing on each share, and this sum was in itself more than he  could meet even after the sale of his house and its contents. He was in  a state of profound depression. He had, while upstairs, been  endeavouring to think of some means of supporting his family, but had  been wholly unable to think of any plan whatever. He knew that at his  age he should find it next to impossible to obtain employment, even as  a clerk at the lowest salary; his knowledge of archaeology would be  absolutely useless to him, for the books he had already published had  not even paid the expenses of printing.    Few words were spoken at breakfast, but when the meal was finished Mrs.  Renshaw began: \"My dear Alfred, Wilfrid and I have been talking over  what we had better do under the circumstances. I have told him that the  failure of the bank involves the loss of all our property, that the  house will have to be sold, and that, in fact, there remains nothing but  the thousand pounds of my settlement. We have talked it over in every  light, and have quite arrived at the conclusion as to what we think the  best thing to be done if you see matters in the same light and will  consent to our plan. I had at first thought of starting a little  school.\"    \"I would never agree to that,\" Mr. Renshaw said; \"never. I must do  something, my dear, though I have not made up my mind in what direction.  But whatever it is, it is for me to work, and not for you.\"    \"Well, we have already given up the idea,\" Mrs. Renshaw went on.  \"Wilfrid was sure that you would not like it, and, as he pointed out,  the money might be spent before I could obtain sufficient pupils to pay.  Besides, he is anxious to be of use; but the difficulty struck us of  obtaining any kind of remunerative work here.\"    \"That is what I have been thinking,\" Mr. Renshaw said. \"I shall be  willing to work at anything in my power, but I don't see what possible  work I can get.\"    \"Quite so, my dear. In this country it is of course terribly difficult  for anyone to get employment unless he has been trained in some  particular line, therefore Wil and I are agreed that the very best plan,  indeed the only plan we can think of, is for us to go out to a new  country. My little money will take us to New Zealand, buy a good-sized  piece of land there, and suffice to enable us to clear it and stock it  to some extent. The life will no doubt be rough for us all for a time;  but none of us will care for that, and at any rate we are sure to be  able to keep the wolf from the door.\"    \"To New Zealand!\" Mr. Renshaw repeated aghast. \"That is a terrible  undertaking. Besides, I know nothing whatever about farming, and I fear  that I am quite unfit for hard work.\"    \"I do not think it will be at all necessary for you to work yourself,  Alfred. Of course we can hire men there just as we can in England. I  believe the natives are willing to work at very low rates of pay, so we  need have no difficulty on that score. Wilfrid is growing up now, and  will soon be able to relieve you of all responsibility, and then you  will be able to devote yourself to your favourite studies; and I should  think that a book from your hand upon native manners and customs would  be sure to be a great success. Accustomed as you are to tracing things  up from small remains, and with your knowledge of primitive peoples,  your work would be very different from those written by men without any  previous acquaintance with such matters.\"    \"The idea certainly pleases me,\" Mr. Renshaw said; \"but, of course, I  shall want time to think over your startling proposal, Helen.\"    \"Of course, my dear. In the meantime we will go on packing up and  preparing to move at once from here, as you say that there must be a  sale of everything; then you can think the matter over, and if you  decide upon any better scheme than ours we can carry that out. If not,  we shall be ready to put ours into execution.\"    The next month was a busy one. There was great sympathy evinced by all  the Renshaw's neighbours and acquaintances when it was heard that their  whole fortune was swept away by the failure of the bank. There were  farewell visits to be paid, not only to these, but to their poorer  neighbours. In answer to inquiries as to their plans, Mr. Renshaw always  replied that at present nothing whatever was settled. Mrs. Renshaw  hinted that, although their plans were not definitely fixed, she thought  it probable that they would go abroad; while Wilfrid and Marion both  informed their friends confidently that they were going to New Zealand.    The work of packing went on. A few articles of furniture that were  special favourites with them all were packed up and sent to be  warehoused in London, in order that they might some day be forwarded to  them when they had made themselves a home; but nothing else was taken  beyond their clothes, a good selection of books for their general  reading, a large box of those which Mr. Renshaw declared absolutely  indispensable to himself, and a few nick-nacks specially prized.  Everything else was handed over for sale for the benefit of the  creditors of the bank. During these weeks Mr. Renshaw continued to speak  as if he regarded the New Zealand project as wholly impracticable, and  on each occasion when he did so his wife replied cheerfully: \"Well, my  dear, we are in no way wedded to it, and are quite ready to give it up  and adopt any plan you may decide upon. The matter is entirely in your  hands.\"    But Mr. Renshaw could hit upon no other scheme; and, indeed, his wife's  suggestion as to a book on the natives of New Zealand had much taken his  fancy. Certainly he, a trained antiquarian, should be able to produce a  book upon such a subject that would be of vastly greater value than  those written by settlers and others having no training whatever that  would qualify them for such work. It was probable that he should be able  to throw some entirely new light upon the origin and history of the  Maoris or natives of New Zealand, and that his book would greatly add to  his reputation, and would sell well. Really the idea was not such a very  bad one, and, for himself, he should certainly prefer a life in a new  country to shabby lodgings in some out-of-the-way place, after having  for so many years been a personage of importance in his own  neighbourhood.    \"I see one great objection to your scheme, Helen, and that is that there  is a war going on with the Maoris.\"    \"I know there is,\" Mrs. Renshaw, who had talked the matter over with  Wilfrid, replied; \"but it is confined to two or three of the tribes, and  the settlers in other parts have been in no way disturbed. The troops  have taken most of their strongholds, and the troubles are considered to  be approaching an end; therefore I do not think there is any occasion  to be uneasy on that score. Besides, in some respects the trouble will  be advantageous, as we should probably be able to buy land cheaper than  we otherwise should have done, and the land will rapidly rise in value  again when the disturbances are over. But, of course, we should not go  to the disturbed districts. These are round Auckland and New Plymouth,  and the troubles are confined to the tribes there. Everything is  perfectly peaceable along the other parts of the coast.\"    It was not until two or three days before the move was to be made from  the house that Mrs. Renshaw recurred to the subject.    \"You have not said yet, Alfred, what plans you have decided upon. As we  shall leave here in three days it is quite time that we made up our  minds about it, as, of course, our movements must depend on your  decision. If you have fixed upon any place for us to settle down in, it  would be cheaper for us to move there at once instead of wasting money  by going up to London first. Another reason I have for asking is, that  Robert and William Grimstone, the gardener's sons, who have got an idea  from something Wilfrid said to them that we might be going abroad, have  asked him to ask you if you would take them with you. They have been  working in the garden under their father for the last two or three  years, and are strong active young fellows of nineteen and twenty. As  their father has worked here ever since we came, and we have known the  young fellows since they were children, such an arrangement would have  been a very pleasant one had you liked my plan of emigrating, as it  would have been much more agreeable having two young fellows we knew  with us instead of strangers. Of course I told Wilfrid to tell them that  nothing whatever was settled, and that our plans were not in any way  formed, and that they had better, therefore, look out for situations  about here, and that I was sure you would give them good letters of  recommendation.\"    Mr. Renshaw was silent. \"I really do not see that there is any occasion  to come to a decision in a hurry,\" he said irritably.    \"Not in a hurry, Alfred,\" his wife said quietly. \"You see, we have had a  month to think it over, and I do not see that we shall be more likely to  settle upon an advantageous scheme at the end of six months"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33648"],[0,"The Mammals of Warren Woods, Berrien County, Michigan (#3)"],[1,"midst of the largest patch of rushes.      _Cleared-upland sedge habitat_:         _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 3.         _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 1.         _Microtus ochrogaster._ Prairie vole. 9.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 1.         _Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus._ Thirteen-striped       ground squirrel. Burrows.    Sedges are dominant over a part of the cleared upland, occurring on  the moist gentle slopes which are too well drained for rushes, but not  in any numbers on the drier and higher parts of the upland. With the  sedges there are a few grasses, and the ground is sometimes covered by  a moss, but the sedges are by far the most abundant plant.    Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took on the first night, August  15, one prairie white-footed mouse and one prairie vole. Other prairie  voles and white-footed mice were taken on later nights, as well as one  Pennsylvania vole and one house mouse. Burrows of the thirteen-striped  ground squirrel were numerous in the sedges.      _Cleared-upland blue-grass habitat_:         _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 12.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 1.         _Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus._ Thirteen-striped       ground squirrel. 23.    The most widespread habitat of the cleared upland on the south part of  the preserve is the blue-grass habitat. In this habitat the  blue-grass, _Poa_, is the dominant plant, growing to a height of  usually not over 0.5 meter. With the blue-grass are associated a few  thistles, yarrow, and several other herbs. During the whole period of  my stay in the region, July and August, the habitat was very dry, and  the grass and herbs had mostly dried up. This habitat and all the  other habitats of the clearing were being heavily pastured by stock.    Trap-lines totaling one hundred mouse traps, set on August 6 and  August 18, took on the first nights two prairie white-footed mice, one  house mouse, and one young thirteen-striped ground squirrel. More  white-footed mice were taken on later nights. Many ground squirrels  were taken in larger traps at the mouths of their burrows; most of  these were young of the year, and all of them were very fat in  preparation for their approaching hibernation.      _Cultivated field habitat_:         _Scalopus aquaticus machrinus._ Prairie mole. 1.         _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 23.         _Microtus ochrogaster._ Prairie vole. 1.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 2.         _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 2.    Cultivated fields occur throughout the region about the woods, but the  only ones in which trapping was done were wheat stubble-fields. After  the wheat was cut off these stubble-fields grew up rather thickly to  weeds. On the ground there were a number of fallen heads of wheat and  some shelled-out grain, furnishing abundant food for mice.    Seventy mouse traps set in a wheat stubble-field just north of Warren  Woods, caught on the first nights, August 13 and August 29, sixteen  prairie white-footed mice. Other white-footed mice and two house mice  were taken on later nights. Several cottontails were seen in this  field, and a few mole ridges were noted. A prairie mole was taken by  Clifford Reid in a grassy patch at the edge of a garden. In another  wheat field the Helming boys picked up a prairie vole.      _Orchard habitat_:         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 1.         _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 2.    No especial study of the mammal life of the orchard was made, and no  intensive trapping was done in the habitat. However, the orchard cannot  be included in any of the other habitats recognized in the region.    A northern white-footed mouse was caught alive by the Helming boys in  an orchard on July 16. A vole was seen to cross a road in a small  orchard on July 15; a trap was set and two Pennsylvania voles secured,  one a young of the year.      _Edificarian habitat_:[1]         _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 1.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 2.         _Rattus norvegicus._ Norway rat. 4.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 22.         _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 2.    From time to time a few traps were set in the old farmhouse and in the  barn and other outbuildings of our camp. In these buildings northern  white-footed mice, Norway rats, and house mice were taken. Several  cottontails were seen in and under the old barn. The Helming boys  trapped a short-tailed shrew and also house mice and a white-footed  mouse in the basement of their house.          RECORDS OF THE NUMBER OF EMBRYOS      All the females taken were examined for embryos, and the results are  here tabulated by species and dates. The term _subadult_ is used to  indicate an individual which has reached adult size, but which is  still immature as shown by the pelage, unworn condition of the teeth,  and weakness of the skull sutures. For each individual the age is  first stated, next the number of embryos if any, and last the length  of the embryos in millimeters measured as they lie rolled in the fetal  membranes. For embryos too small to measure with field equipment the  term _small_ is applied.    These records indicate the breeding period of the different species  and the number of young.      _Mephitis nigra._ Eastern skunk        August 19: subadult, 0 embryos.      _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed mouse        July 16: adult, 3 embryos, size small.

NEW STATE RECORD OF THE PRAIRIE VOLE      The specimens of prairie vole, _Microtus ochrogaster_, listed above from  the sedges and rushes of cleared upland in the Warren Woods preserve and  from a nearby wheat field constitute the first authentic record of the  species from Michigan. The prairie vole had previously been erroneously  reported to be abundant in Washtenaw County by Covert[2], who evidently  mistook the Pennsylvania vole for this species.          OTHER MAMMALS OF THIS REGION      The following notes on mammals formerly or at present living in the  region but not found by me in Warren Woods are based mostly on  information furnished by George R. Fox, Director of the Edward K.  Warren Foundation, and by William Schmidt, a trapper and hunter.    _Didelphis virginiana virginiana._ Virginia opossum. Three were seen  and one captured in Three Oaks in the winter of 1919-20, and another  was found in a granary on the outskirts of the town. The previous  winter one was shot just southwest of town, and another was seen in a  ravine north of Harbert. One was killed in Warren Woods some time ago.    _Condylura cristata._ Star-nosed mole. Mr. Hans captured one four miles  south of Three Oaks, near the Indiana line in 1919, and brought the skin  to Mr. Fox. One was taken by Dr. Parker at Lakeside in June, 1919.    _Ursus americanus americanus._ Eastern black bear. Formerly occurred  in the region.    _Canis lycaon._ Timber wolf. About eleven years ago three were killed  from a pack of nine wolves at Lakeside. About 1910 a pack of eight  were seen at various times during the winter on the marsh between"]]]
