This cactus is most common in disturbed areas  such as sandy flats bordering washes, eroded adobe banks, and land once  cleared by man. In these areas it is often the dominant plant with  respect to area covered, usually growing in dense patches each covering  approximately 150 square feet. It provides substitute nesting sites for  _Neotoma lepida_ in areas devoid of rock piles, and is probably the  major factor governing the distribution of this wood rat in the  sageland. Cottontails and brush rabbits use prickly-pear cactus  extensively as refuge. Their forms and short burrows can be seen beneath  many of the clumps of cactus.    This cactus serves as food for many mammals at least in the fruiting  period in the fall. Usually only the fruit is eaten, but some pads are  chewed by rabbits. The fruit or seeds of this plant are eaten by striped  skunks, gray foxes, coyotes, pocket mice, kangaroo rats, wood rats, and  probably white-footed mice.    The coyote is the dominant carnivore of the coastal sage flats. Many  individuals spend the day in the adjacent chaparral-covered foothills  and travel down into the flats at night to forage.      Southern Oak Woodland Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Alnus rhombifolia_  _Quercus agrifolia_  _Ribes indecorum_  _Rhus integrifolia_  _Rhus ovata_  _Rhus trilobata_    This association is limited to the Pacific slope of the mountain range,  occurs in the mouths of canyons and on the floors of canyons, and  extends up the larger canyons to 4000 feet elevation or higher. In a few  areas on the flats at the coastal base of the range the oaks replace the  coastal sage.    The large oaks forming an overhead canopy and the lack of much  undergrowth give the oak woodland a shaded parklike appearance. Few  brushy or herbaceous plants grow in the mull-laden soil beneath the  oaks. Some grasses, however, are present locally.    Two habitats are found in the oak woodland: the pure oak woodland and  the riparian. Much of the oak woodland is in canyons and therefore near  streams or seepages. The larger streams have bordering growths of  alders, willows, and blackberries, inhabited by meadow mice and shrews  that are normally absent from the adjacent oak woodland. NEOTOMA  FUSCIPES MACROTIS and PEROMYSCUS CALIFORNICUS INSIGNIS are commonly  found in the riparian habitat, and _Peromyscus boylii_ probably reaches  peak abundance in the stream-side thickets and tangles of plant debris.    The rather open floor of the oak woodland is relatively devoid of mammal  life. _Peromyscus californicus_ and _Peromyscus boylii_, the only  ground-dwelling rodents commonly found here, usually are taken near the  limited areas of brushy growth, or the shelter afforded by logs and  fallen branches. The paucity of shelter for small mammals seems to be an  important factor limiting rodent populations in the oak woodland.    In the foothills of the San Gabriels the gray squirrel is restricted to  the oak woodland, even though this association may be represented by  only a narrow strip of canyon bottom oak trees. The presence or absence  of \"bridges\" of oak woodland between mountains which are centers of gray  squirrel populations and nearby ranges has probably been a major factor  influencing the present geographic distribution of this animal.    The raccoon is the most abundant carnivore of the oak woodland, being  especially common in the riparian habitat.      Chaparral Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Adenostoma fasciculatum_  _Rhamnus crocea_  _Quercus dumosa_  _Cercocarpus betuloides_  _Yucca Whipplei_  _Prunus ilicifolia_  _Ceanothus sp._  _Arctostaphylos sp._  _Umbellularia californica_    This association is characteristic of the Pacific slope of the San  Gabriels and extends from roughly 2000 feet elevation to 5000 or 6000  feet elevation. The ecotone between the chaparral and yellow pine forest  associations covers a broad elevational belt, with chaparral following  dry slopes up into coniferous forests, and conifers extending down north  slopes surrounded by chaparral.    The chaparral association is characterized by tracts of dense brushy  plants. These plants are from three to ten feet tall, their interlacing  branches often forming nearly impenetrable thickets. Typically little  herbaceous growth is present beneath the chaparral, the ground being  covered with varying amounts of mull.    The effects of fire, slope, exposure, and elevation, make the chaparral  association extremely varied with regard to habitats or plant  formations. There are nearly pure stands of greasewood on the lower arid  slopes; scrub oak, sumac, and lilac clothe less dry exposures; scrub  oak and bay trees occur commonly amid granite talus; and locally groves  of bigcone-spruce are found. Because of the many habitats present, and  the difficulty of collecting in the chaparral, less was learned of the  ecology of the mammals in this association than of those occurring  elsewhere. The distribution of several chaparral-inhabiting mammals  seems to be influenced by the distribution of locally characteristic  plants, for example oak and bay woodland, or greasewood chaparral.    Several habitats within the chaparral community support few species of  mammals and few individuals. Possibly the compact, rocky nature of the  soil limits burrowing rodents, and the lack of herbaceous growth limits  the food supply. Steep rocky slopes in San Antonio Canyon grown to  mountain-mahogany and scrub oak were sparsely populated by _Peromyscus  boylii rowleyi_, _Peromyscus californicus insignis_, and _Neotoma  fuscipes macrotis_. Fifty traps set on such a slope for one night caught  only three _Peromyscus_. Traps set in tracts of greasewood brush on dry  south slopes at the head of Cow Canyon produced only California mice,  _Peromyscus californicus insignis_ Rhoads.    Following is a list of the mammals taken in the course of approximately  600 trap nights in the lower parts of the chaparral belt. All of the  traps were set on slopes in San Antonio Canyon below 4000 feet  elevation. The list gives a general indication of the relative numbers  of rodents inhabiting one chaparral habitat: the arid greasewood-covered  south slopes of the lower chaparral belt.

The following list  gives the mammals taken in the course of about 200 trap nights in the  granite talus one half mile northwest of the mouth of Icehouse Canyon,  at 5200 feet elevation.

Yellow Pine Forest Association    MAJOR PLANTS    _Pinus ponderosa_  _P. lambertiana_  _Libocedrus decurrens_  _Abies concolor_  _Quercus Kelloggii_  _Ribes nevadense_  _Ribes Roezlii_  _Arctostaphylos sp._  _Ceanothus cordulatus_    The crest of the range, from the upper limit of the chaparral  association at roughly 6000 feet to the limited areas of boreal flora  above 8500 feet elevation, is covered by yellow pine forests. On the  desert slope of the range the coniferous forests which extend down to  about 6000 feet represent the best development of this association,  while the coniferous forests on the coastal side of the drainage divide  are often more or less diluted by chaparral elements. For example,  yellow pines"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#3)"],[1,"different from what we find in  natural sciences, and often no adequate vocabulary based on common human  experiences. An American who has travelled in Asia and an Englishman who  has travelled in Australia may meet in Paris and exchange travelling  experiences with mutual understanding, because both of them have  experienced travel; and they will have an adequate vocabulary to  describe each experience, because most men have also experienced travel.  But a saint who has known the spiritual condition called ecstasy cannot  explain ecstasy to a man who has never known it, and if he should try to  do so would discover at once that no modern language is suitable for the  purpose. His experience is rare and not universal, and men have  developed no complete vocabulary to describe experiences not common to  the majority of mankind, and this is especially true of psychical  experiences. It is the same in dealing with fairies, as these are  hypothetically conceived, for only a few men and women can assert that  they have seen fairies, and hence there is no adequate vocabulary to  describe fairies. Among the Ancients, who dealt so largely with  psychical sciences, there seems to have been a common language which  could be used to explain the invisible world and its inhabitants; but we  of this age have not yet developed such a language. Consequently, men  who deny human immortality, as well as men with religious faith who have  not through personal psychical experiences transformed that faith into a  fact, nowadays when they happen to read what Plato, Iamblichus, or any  of the Neo-Platonists have written, or even what moderns have written in  attempting to explain psychic facts, call it all mysticism. And to the  great majority of Europeans and Americans, mysticism is a most  convenient noun, applicable to anything which may seem reasonable yet  wholly untranslatable in terms of their own individual experience; and  mysticism usually means something quite the reverse of scientific  simply because we have by usage unwisely limited the meaning of the word  _science_ to a knowledge of things material and visible, whereas it  really means a knowing or a knowledge of everything which exists. We  have tried to deal with the rare psychical experiences of Irish, Scotch,  Manx, Welsh, or Breton seers, and psychics generally, in the clearest  language possible; but if now and then we are charged with being  mystical, this is our defence.      III. THE METHOD OF STUDYING THE FAIRY-FAITH    In this study, which is first of all a folk-lore study, we pursue  principally an anthropo-psychological method of interpreting the Celtic  belief in fairies, though we do not hesitate now and then to call in the  aid of philology; and we make good use of the evidence offered by  mythologies, religions, metaphysics, and physical sciences. Folk-lore, a  century ago was considered beneath the serious consideration of  scholars; but there has come about a complete reversal of scholarly  opinion, for now it is seen that the beliefs of the people, their  legends, and their songs are the source of nearly all literatures, and  that their institutions and customs are the origin of those of modern  times. And, to-day, to the new science of folk-lore,--which, as Mr.  Andrew Lang says, must be taken to include psychical research or  psychical sciences,--archaeology, anthropology, and comparative  mythology and religion are indispensable. Thus folk-lore offers the  scientific means of studying man in the sense meant by the poet who  declared that the proper study of mankind is man.      IV. DIVISIONS OF THE STUDY    This study is divided into four sections or parts. The first one deals  with the living Fairy-Faith among the Celts themselves; the second, with  the recorded and ancient Fairy-Faith as we find it in Celtic literature  and mythology; the third, with the Fairy-Faith in its religious aspects;  and in the fourth section an attempt has been made to suggest how the  theories of our newest science, psychical research, explain the belief  in fairies.    I have set forth in the first section in detail and as clearly as  possible the testimony communicated to me by living Celts who either  believe in fairies, or else say that they have seen fairies; and  throughout other sections I have preferred to draw as much as possible  of the material from men and women rather than from books. Books too  often are written out of other books, and too seldom from the life of  man; and in a scientific study of the Fairy-Faith, such as we have  undertaken, the Celt himself is by far the best, in fact the only  authority. For us it is much less important to know what scholars think  of fairies than to know what the Celtic people think of fairies. This is  especially true in considering the Fairy-Faith as it exists now.      V. THE COLLECTING OF MATERIAL    In June, 1908, after a year's preparatory work in things Celtic under  the direction of the Oxford Professor of Celtic, Sir John Rhys, I  began to travel in Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany, and to  collect material there at first hand from the people who have shaped and  who still keep alive the Fairy-Faith; and during the year 1909-10 fresh  folk-lore expeditions were made into Brittany, Ireland, and Wales, and  then, finally, the study of the Fairy-Faith was made pan-Celtic by  similar expeditions throughout the Isle of Man, and into Cornwall. Many  of the most remote parts of these lands were visited; and often there  was no other plan to adopt, or any method better, or more natural, than  to walk day after day from one straw-thatched cottage to another, living  on the simple wholesome food of the peasants. Sometimes there was the  picturesque mountain-road to climb, sometimes the route lay through  marshy peat-lands, or across a rolling grass-covered country; and with  each change of landscape came some new thought and some new impression  of the Celtic life, or perhaps some new description of a fairy.    This immersion in the most striking natural and social environment of  the Celtic race, gave me an insight into the mind, the religion, the  mysticism, and the very heart of the Celt himself, such as no mere study  in libraries ever could do. I tried to see the world as he does; I  participated in his innermost thoughts about the great problem of life  and death, with which he of all peoples is most deeply concerned; and  thus he revealed to me the source of his highest ideals and  inspirations. I daily felt the deep and innate seriousness of his  ancestral nature; and, living as he lives, I tried in all ways to be  like him. I was particularly qualified for such an undertaking: partly  Celtic myself by blood and perhaps largely so by temperament, I found it  easy to sympathize with the Celt and with his environments. Further,  being by birth an American, I was in many places privileged to enter  where an Englishman, or a non-Celt of Europe would not be; and my  education under the free ideals of a new-world democracy always made it  possible for me to view economic, political, religious, and racial  questions in Celtic lands apart from the European point of view, and  without the European prejudices which are so numerous and so greatly to  be regretted. But without any doubt, during my sojourn, extending over  three years, among the Celts, these various environments shaped my  thoughts about fairies and Fairyland--as they ought to have done if  truth is ever to be reached by research.    These experiences of mine lead me to believe that the natural aspects of  Celtic countries, much more than those of most non-Celtic countries,  impress man and awaken in him some unfamiliar part of himself--call it  the Subconscious Self, the Subliminal Self, the Ego, or what you  will--which gives him an unusual power to know and to feel invisible, or  psychical, influences. What is there, for example, in London, or Paris,  or Berlin, or New York to awaken the intuitive power of man, that  subconsciousness deep-hidden in him, equal to the solitude of those  magical environments of Nature which the Celts enjoy and love?    In my travels, when the weather was too wild to venture out by day, or  when the more favourable hours of the night had arrived, with fires and  candles lit, or even during a road-side chat amid the day's journey,  there was gathered together little by little, from one country and  another, the mass of testimony which chapter ii contains. And with all  this my opinions began to take shape; for when I set out from Oxford in  June, I had no certain or clear ideas as to what fairies are, nor why  there should be belief in them. In less than a year afterwards I found  myself committed to the Psychological Theory, which I am herein setting  forth.      VI. THEORIES OF THE FAIRY-FAITH    We make continual reference throughout our study to this Psychological  Theory of the Nature and Origin of the Celtic Fairy-Faith, and it is one  of our purposes to demonstrate that this is the root theory which  includes or absorbs the four theories already advanced to account for  the belief in fairies. To guide the reader in his own conclusions, we  shall here briefly outline these four theories.    The first of them may be called the Naturalistic Theory, which is, that  in ancient and in modern times man's belief in gods, spirits, or fairies  has been the direct result of his attempts to explain or to rationalize  natural phenomena. Of this theory we accept as true that the belief in  fairies often anthropomorphically reflects the natural environment as  well as the social condition of the people who hold the belief. For  example, amid the beautiful low-lying green hills and gentle dells of  Connemara (Ireland), the 'good people' are just as beautiful, just as  gentle, and just as happy as their environment; while amid the  dark-rising mountains and in the mysterious cloud-shadowed lakes of the  Scotch"]]]
