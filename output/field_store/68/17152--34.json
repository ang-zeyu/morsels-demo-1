One  Pompilus, though greatly inferior to the Segestria in size and  strength, nevertheless makes war upon the Black Spider and succeeds in  overpowering this formidable quarry. This is Pompilus apicalis, VAN DER  LIND, who is hardly larger than the Hive-bee, but very much slenderer.  She is of a uniform black; her wings are a cloudy brown, with  transparent tips. Let us follow her in her expeditions to the old wall  inhabited by the Segestria: we will track her for whole afternoons  during the July heats; and we will arm ourselves with patience, for the  perilous capture of the game must take the Wasp a long time.    The Spider-huntress explores the wall minutely; she runs, leaps and  flies; she comes and goes, flitting to and fro. The antennae quiver; the  wings, raised above the back, continually beat one against the other.  Ah, here she is, close to a Segestria's funnel! The Spider, who has  hitherto remained invisible, instantly appears at the entrance to  the tube; she spreads her six fore-legs outside, ready to receive the  huntress. Far from fleeing before the terrible apparition, she watches  the watcher, fully prepared to prey upon her enemy. Before this intrepid  demeanour the Pompilus draws back. She examines the coveted game, walks  round it for a moment, then goes away without attempting anything. When  she has gone, the Segestria retires indoors, backwards. For the second  time the Wasp passes near an inhabited funnel. The Spider on the lookout  at once shows herself on the threshold of her dwelling, half out of her  tube, ready for defence and perhaps also for attack. The Pompilus moves  away and the Segestria reenters her tube. A fresh alarm: the Pompilus  returns; another threatening demonstration on the part of the Spider.  Her neighbour, a little later, does better than this: while the huntress  is prowling about in the neighbourhood of the funnel, she suddenly leaps  out of the tube, with the lifeline which will save her from falling,  should she miss her footing, attached to her spinnerets; she rushes  forward and hurls herself in front of the Pompilus, at a distance  of some eight inches from her burrow. The Wasp, as though terrified,  immediately decamps; and the Segestria no less suddenly retreats  indoors.    Here, we must admit, is a strange quarry: it does not hide, but is eager  to show itself; it does not run away, but flings itself in front of the  hunter. If our observations were to cease here, could we say which of  the two is the hunter and which the hunted? Should we not feel sorry for  the imprudent Pompilus? Let a thread of the trap entangle her leg; and  it is all up with her. The other will be there, stabbing her in the  throat. What then is the method which she employs against the Segestria,  always on the alert, ready for defence, audacious to the point of  aggression? Shall I surprise the reader if I tell him that this problem  filled me with the most eager interest, that it held me for weeks in  contemplation before that cheerless wall? Nevertheless, my tale will be  a short one.    On several occasions I see the Pompilus suddenly fling herself on one of  the Spider's legs, seize it with her mandibles and endeavour to draw the  animal from its tube. It is a sudden rush, a surprise attack, too  quick to permit the Spider to parry it. Fortunately, the latter's two  hind-legs are firmly hooked to the dwelling; and the Segestria escapes  with a jerk, for the other, having delivered her shock attack, hastens  to release her hold; if she persisted, the affair might end badly for  her. Having failed in this assault, the Wasp repeats the procedure  at other funnels; she will even return to the first when the alarm is  somewhat assuaged. Still hopping and fluttering, she prowls around the  mouth, whence the Segestria watches her, with her legs outspread. She  waits for the propitious moment; she leaps forward, seizes a leg, tugs  at it and springs out of reach. More often than not, the Spider holds  fast; sometimes she is dragged out of the tube, to a distance of a few  inches, but immediately returns, no doubt with the aid of her unbroken  lifeline.    The Pompilus' intention is plain: she wants to eject the Spider from her  fortress and fling her some distance away. So much perseverance leads to  success. This time all goes well: with a vigorous and well-timed tug  the Wasp has pulled the Segestria out and at once lets her drop to  the ground. Bewildered by her fall and even more demoralized by being  wrested from her ambush, the Spider is no longer the bold adversary that  she was. She draws her legs together and cowers into a depression in  the soil. The huntress is there on the instant to operate on the evicted  animal. I have barely time to draw near to watch the tragedy when the  victim is paralysed by a thrust of the sting in the thorax.    Here at last, in all its Machiavellian cunning, is the shrewd method  of the Pompilus. She would be risking her life if she attacked the  Segestria in her home; the Wasp is so convinced of it that she takes  good care not to commit this imprudence; but she knows also that, once  dislodged from her dwelling, the Spider is as timid, as cowardly as she  was bold at the centre of her funnel. The whole point of her tactics,  therefore, lies in dislodging the creature. This done, the rest is  nothing.    The Tarantula-huntress must behave in the same manner. Enlightened  by her kinswoman, Pompilus apicalis, my mind pictures her wandering  stealthily around the Lycosa's rampart. The Lycosa hurries up from  the bottom of her burrow, believing that a victim is approaching; she  ascends her vertical tube, spreading her fore-legs outside, ready to  leap. But it is the Ringed Pompilus who leaps, seizes a leg, tugs and  hurls the Lycosa from her burrow. The Spider is henceforth a craven  victim, who will let herself be stabbed without dreaming of employing  her venomous fangs. Here craft triumphs over strength; and this craft is  not inferior to mine, when, wishing to capture the Tarantula, I make her  bite a spike of grass which I dip into the burrow, lead her gently  to the surface and then with a sudden jerk throw her outside. For the  entomologist as for the Pompilus, the essential thing is to make the  Spider leave her stronghold. After this there is no difficulty in  catching her, thanks to the utter bewilderment of the evicted animal.    Two contrasting points impress me in the facts which I have just set  forth: the shrewdness of the Pompilus and the folly of the Spider. I  will admit that the Wasp may gradually have acquired, as being highly  beneficial to her posterity, the instinct by which she first of all so  judiciously drags the victim from its refuge, in order there to paralyse  it without incurring danger, provided that you will explain why the  Segestria, possessing an intellect no less gifted than that of the  Pompilus, does not yet know how to counteract the trick of which she  has so long been the victim. What would the Black Spider need to do to  escape her exterminator? Practically nothing: it would be enough for her  to withdraw into her tube, instead of coming up to post herself at the  entrance, like a sentry, whenever the enemy is in the neighbourhood. It  is very brave of her, I agree, but also very risky. The Pompilus will  pounce upon one of the legs spread outside the burrow for defence  and attack; and the besieged Spider will perish, betrayed by her own  boldness. This posture is excellent when waiting for prey. But the Wasp  is not a quarry; she is an enemy and one of the most dreaded of enemies.  The Spider knows this. At the sight of the Wasp, instead of placing  herself fearlessly but foolishly on her threshold, why does she not  retreat into her fortress, where the other would not attack her? The  accumulated experience of generations should have taught her this  elementary tactical device, which is of the greatest value to the  prosperity of her race. If the Pompilus has perfected her method of  attack, why has not the Segestria perfected her method of defence? Is it  possible that centuries upon centuries should have modified the one  to its advantage without succeeding in modifying the other? Here I am  utterly at a loss. And I say to myself, in all simplicity: since the  Pompili must have Spiders, the former have possessed their patient  cunning and the other their foolish audacity from all time. This may  be puerile, if you like to think it so, and not in keeping with the  transcendental aims of our fashionable theorists; the argument contains  neither the subjective nor the objective point of view, neither  adaptation nor differentiation, neither atavism nor evolutionism. Very  well, but at least I understand it.    Let us return to the habits of Pompilus apicalis. Without expecting  results of any particular interest, for in captivity the respective  talents of the huntress and the quarry seem to slumber, I place  together, in a wide jar, a Wasp and a Segestria. The Spider and her  enemy mutually avoid each other, both being equally timid. A judicious  shake or two brings them into contact. The Segestria, from time to time,  catches hold of the Pompilus, who gathers herself up as best she can,  without attempting to use her sting; the Spider rolls the insect between  her legs and even between her mandibles, but appears to dislike doing  it. Once I see her lie on her back and hold the Pompilus above her,  as far away as possible, while turning her over in her fore-legs  and munching at her with her mandibles. The Wasp, whether by her own  adroitness or owing to the Spider's dread of her, promptly escapes  from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34634"],[0,"A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook (#3)"],[1," Roberts. As they rowed towards the shore, Captain Cook ordered the  launch to leave her station at the west point of the bay, in order to  assist his own boat. This is a circumstance worthy of notice; for it  clearly shows, that he was not unapprehensive of meeting with resistance  from the natives; or unmindful of the necessary preparation for the  safety of himself and his people. I will venture to say, that from the  appearance of things, just at that time, there was not one, beside  himself, who judged that such precaution was absolutely requisite; so  little did his conduct on the occasion bear the marks of rashness, or a  precipitate self-confidence! He landed, with the marines, at the upper  end of the town of Kavaroah (Kaawaloa): the Indians immediately flocked  round, as usual, and showed him the customary marks of respect, by  prostrating themselves before him. There were no signs of hostilities,  or much alarm among them. Captain Cook, however, did not seem willing to  trust to appearances; but was particularly attentive to the disposition  of the marines, and to have them kept clear of the crowd. He first  enquired for the king's sons, two youths[4] who were much attached to  him, and generally his companions on board. Messengers being sent for  them, they soon came to him, and informing him that their father was  asleep, at a house not far from them, he accompanied them thither, and  took the marines along with them. As he passed along, the natives every  where prostrated themselves before him, and seemed to have lost no part  of that respect they had always shown to his person. He was joined by  several chiefs, among whom was Kanynah (Kanaina), and his brother  Koohowrooah (Kuhaulua?). They kept the crowd in order, according to  their usual custom; and being ignorant of his intention in coming on  shore, frequently asked him if he wanted any hogs, or other provisions;  he told them that he did not, and that his business was to see the king.  When he arrived at the house he ordered some of the Indians to go in,  and inform Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu), that he waited without to speak with  him. They came out two or three times, and instead of returning any  answer from the king, presented some pieces of red cloth to him, which  made Captain Cook suspect that he was not in the house; he therefore  desired the lieutenant of marines to go in. The lieutenant found the old  man just awaked from sleep, and seemingly alarmed at the message; but he  came out without hesitation. Captain Cook took him by the hand, and in a  friendly manner, asked him to go on board, to which he very readily  consented. Thus far matters appeared in a favourable train, and the  natives did not seem much alarmed or apprehensive of hostility on our  side; at which Captain Cook expressed himself a little surprized,  saying, that as the inhabitants of that town appeared innocent of  stealing the cutter, he should not molest them, but that he must get the  king on board. Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu) sat down before his door, and was  surrounded by a great crowd: Kanynah (Kanaina) and his brother were both  very active in keeping order among them. In a little time, however, the  Indians were observed arming themselves with long spears, clubs, and  daggers, and putting on thick mats, which they use as armour. This  hostile appearance increased, and became more alarming, on the arrival  of two men in a canoe from the opposite side of the bay, with the news  of a chief, called Kareemoo (Kalimo), having been killed by one of the  \"Discovery's\" boats, in their passage across: they had also delivered  this account to each of the ships. Upon that information, the women, who  were sitting upon the beach at their breakfasts, and conversing  familiarly with our people in the boats, retired, and a confused murmur  spread through the crowd. An old priest came to Captain Cook, with a  cocoa nut in his hand, which he held out to him as a present, at the  same time singing very loud. He was often desired to be silent, but in  vain: he continued importunate and troublesome, and there was no such  thing as getting rid of him or his noise: it seemed, as if he meant to  divert their attention from his countrymen, who were growing more  tumultuous, and arming themselves in every quarter. Captain Cook, being  at the same time surrounded by a great crowd, thought his situation  rather hazardous: he therefore ordered the lieutenant of marines to  march his small party to the water-side, where the boats lay within a  few yards of the shore: the Indians readily made a lane for them to  pass, and did not offer to interrupt them. The distance they had to go  might be about fifty or sixty yards; Captain Cook followed, having hold  of Kariopoo's (Kalaniopuu's) hand, who accompanied him very willingly:  he was attended by his wife, two sons, and several chiefs. The  troublesome old priest followed, making the same savage noise. Keowa  (Keoua)[5], the younger son, went directly into the pinnace, expecting  his father to follow; but just as he arrived at the water-side, his wife  threw her arms about his neck, and, with the assistance of two chiefs,  forced him to sit down by the side of a double canoe. Captain Cook  expostulated with them, but to no purpose: they would not suffer the  king to proceed, telling him, that he would be put to death if he went  on board the ship. Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu), whose conduct seemed entirely  resigned to the will of others, hung down his head, and appeared much  distressed.    While the king was in this situation, a chief, well known to us, of the  name of Coho (Koho), was observed lurking near, with an iron dagger,  partly concealed under his cloke, seemingly, with the intention of  stabbing Captain Cook, or the lieutenant of marines. The latter proposed  to fire at him, but Captain Cook would not permit it. Coho (Koho)  closing upon them, obliged the officer to strike him with his piece,  which made him retire. Another Indian laid hold of the serjeant's  musket, and endeavoured to wrench it from him, but was prevented by the  lieutenant's making a blow at him. Captain Cook, seeing the tumult  increase, and the Indians growing more daring and resolute, observed,  that if he were to take the king off by force, he could not do it  without sacrificing the lives of many of his people. He then paused a  little, and was on the point of giving his order to reimbark, when a man  threw a stone at him; which he returned with a discharge of small shot,  (with which one barrel of his double piece was loaded). The man, having  a thick mat before him, received little or no hurt; he brandished his  spear, and threatened to dart it at Captain Cook, who being still  unwilling to take away his life, instead of firing with ball, knocked  him down with his musket. He expostulated strongly with the most forward  of the crowd, upon their turbulent behaviour. He had given up all  thoughts of getting the king on board, as it appeared impracticable; and  his care was then only to act on the defensive, and to secure a safe  embarkation for his small party, which was closely pressed by a body of  several thousand people. Keowa (Keoua), the king's son, who was in the  pinnace, being alarmed on hearing the first firing, was, at his own  entreaty, put on shore again; for even at that time, Mr. Roberts, who  commanded her, did not apprehend that Captain Cook's person was in any  danger: otherwise he would have detained the prince, which, no doubt,  would have been a great check on the Indians. One man was observed,  behind a double canoe, in the action of darting his spear at Captain  Cook, who was forced to fire at him in his own defence, but happened to  kill another close to him, equally forward in the tumult: the serjeant  observing that he had missed the man he aimed at, received orders to  fire at him, which he did, and killed him. By this time, the impetuosity  of the Indians was somewhat repressed; they fell back in a body, and  seemed staggered; but being pushed on by those behind, they returned to  the charge, and poured a volley of stones among the marines, who,  without waiting for orders, returned it with a general discharge of  musketry, which was instantly followed by a fire from the boats. At this  Captain Cook was heard to express his astonishment: he waved his hand to  the boats, called to them to cease firing, and to come nearer in to  receive the marines. Mr. Roberts immediately brought the pinnace as  close to the shore as he could, without grounding, notwithstanding the  showers of stones that fell among the people; but Mr. John Williamson,  the lieutenant, who commanded in the launch, instead of pulling in to  the assistance of Captain Cook, withdrew his boat further off, at the  moment that everything seems to have depended upon the timely exertions  of those in the boats. By his own account, he mistook the signal: but be  that as it may, this circumstance appears to me, to have decided the  fatal turn of the affair, and to have removed every chance which  remained with Captain Cook, of escaping with his life. The business of  saving the marines out of the water, in consequence of that, fell  altogether upon the pinnace; which thereby became so much crowded, that  the crew were, in a great measure, prevented from using their fire-arms,  or giving what assistance they otherwise might have done, to Captain  Cook; so that he seems, at the most critical point of time, to have  wanted the assistance of both boats, owing to the removal of the launch.  For notwithstanding that they kept up a fire on the crowd from the  situation to which they removed in that boat, the fatal confusion which  ensued on her being withdrawn, to say the least of it, must have  prevented the full effect, that the prompt co-operation of the two  boats, according to Captain Cook's orders, must have had, towards the  preservation of himself and his people. At that time, it was "]]]
