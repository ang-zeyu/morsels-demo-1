In the legs use as large  wire as will go easily through the tarsus and not rip the skin open, to  insure rigidity in the finished specimen. Use galvanized soft steel  wires if possible. If ordinary black iron wire is used it should be  waxed before placing. For the tail cut one wire of a length to go half  way through the body and leave enough protruding to allow of handily  setting tail into position.    Cut six or eight medium wires, twice length of thickness of body, for  wing pinning and feather wrapping, if either or both of these are found  necessary. Make cornered points on wires. Sharpen neck- and wing-wires  at both ends, leg, tail, and pinning-wires at one end.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    To set neck-wire in body, thrust it in a little above center of larger  end of body, run it diagonally through and out at middle back (see Fig.  5). Push two-thirds its length out of back, loop one-third back along  its own length and push it back through body so that both ends protrude,  shorter end beneath other in front. Bend the short end squarely and  force it into front of body to anchor neck-wire firmly in place. Consult  note sketch and wrap a soft neck of natural size upon the wire (see Fig.  6). Leave head end of neck a little bit long to set into brain cavity  for solid anchorage. For neck material use cotton in small birds, tow in  medium size, and fine excelsior in large birds. Only excelsior will need  tying down with thread or cord.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    To make cords in nape of neck, which support the mane, thread a large  sewing needle with heavy thread for small birds, a darning needle with  string for larger. Double the cord and knot its end heavily. Run the  needle through ridge of body just back of shoulders, carry cord to a  little below where skull will set to and run cord through neck from back  to front so it will protrude between jaws when they are set (see Fig.  7).    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    Let long end of cord hang free so that it may be passed through the  mouth when skull is set on neck-wire. With this done, lay aside the  body.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    The next step is wiring the wings and legs and substituting muscles of  same. To place a wing-wire draw the wing inside out. Take wing bone in  left hand. Place point of wire under small tendon that draws across back  of elbow joint, push through and up to wrist. Turn wing right side out  and by parting feathers on under side of wrist, locate two points of  bone at joint which have a cord or tendon drawn across between them.  Work the wire through under this.    The simplest way to anchor tip of wing-wire is to push it outside skin  just forward of wrist, turn a short right angle bend near its tip with  pliers and carrying it forward, push the point through a hollow pan  which will be found in the hand bones (see Fig. 8).    After a wing-wire is set, wrap cotton, tow, or excelsior about the upper  arm-bone to approximate shape and size of flesh removed. Wrap slightly  with thread or cord and tie.    In a small bird in which the forearm was skinned out from the inside,  slip in a film of cotton or tow to replace flesh of same. In a large  bird in which the wing was opened along forearm and hand, lay in a soft  filling after skin is in place on artificial body and sewn up. Sew wing  incision carefully, beginning at body and keeping feathers out of  stitch.    To place the leg-wires, start sharpened end into ball of foot, push wire  upward through back of leg to hock or heel joint. Take leg in left hand,  keeping heel straight, and push wire through at back of joint. A little  turning of the wire will aid in passing through leg easily.    Now turn leg inside out and push wire to just beyond end of shin bone  (see Fig. 9). Slip wire rapidly back and forth in leg to make it run  easily. There should be no kinks in wires.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    Hold wire down to back of bone and wrap on cotton, tow, or excelsior,  according to size of bird, to replace flesh. Tie this material loosely  with a few turns of thread or cord. See that wing and leg wrapping is  smooth and nicely tapering from elbow and heel.    It now remains to place the body, set wings and legs and tail, sew up  the breast incision, and, if a large bird, the wings.    In preparing to place the body, take a turn of end of nape cord about  tip of neck-wire and twist a wisp of cotton about them both to prevent  wire catching in neck skin when passing through. Hold up the bird-skin  by the head, shake it out loose and rattle neck-wire up through the  neck. Run wire out of mouth, remove cotton and release free end of nape  cord. Draw wire back to base of skull, leaving nape cord hanging from  mouth. Now push wire through brain cavity, between eye sockets and  forward out of roof of mouth inside until neck is seated in brain  cavity. Tip of wire may have to be curved to accomplish this, in  curve-billed birds.    When head is set take excelsior body in right hand, hold it with head  up, and with left hand pull shoulder skin into place. Now lay the bird  down, take a wing-wire and start it through the body at side of back,  one-half to one and one-half inches, according to size of bird, to rear  of actual position of shoulder joint.    Pull wire through on opposite side of breast. When head of wing-bone is  drawn down to same distance as above, from body, bend wire sharply  forward to lay upon body, thus setting shoulder joint so that it is  flexible. Now turn over end of wire left protruding from side of breast  and clinch it into body squarely. When wings are set shake skin down  over body and set legs.    Having previously marked the hip joint with a spot of ink, run a  leg-wire through at this point, quartering it out on opposite side where  thigh will set. Pull wire through to a considerable length without  drawing other end up into the foot.    Loop sharp end squarely, with long enough point to go clear through body  again, push it back through, clinching tip down on other side. Now pull  the knee to its proper distance from hip joint, thus leaving bare wire  for thigh bone. Bend thigh into place flat against side of body, with  knee at side of breast.    When legs are set shake and carefully pull skin of rump into place. Take  tail-wire and push it through center of tail, under the bone, using care  that it does not disturb tail quills. Push sharp end of wire into body  above center and forward of end of body.    Consult notes for actual set of tail. See that wire supports tail  without looseness. (For general details of wiring, see Fig. 10.) Fill  butt of tail and thighs with a little chopped tow.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    Now lay the bird upon its back. Turn the legs out at the sides a little,  leaving knees against body. Draw edges of skin together along incision  and sew up with medium stitches, neither short and labored or long and  slouchy. Begin at rump end of incision.    In a bird in which the neck was opened to accommodate skinning the head,  sew up this incision carefully, beginning at body end and sewing toward  head.    When a large bird, in which the wings were opened for cleaning, is to be  mounted with closed wings, very little sewing need be done, but if the  wings are to be raised or spread the incision should be neatly stitched  its entire length.    Also in a large bird, in which the tendons were drawn through ball of  foot, the fatty tissue of the ball should be replaced with chopped tow  and the short incision sewn up. Beeswax will keep thread from fraying.    With the sewing all done, bend the legs into semi-position, fold the  wings, if to be closed, and turn them sharply up over the back so that  their under side is outward and elbows meet over center of back. Shake  out the plumage a little by grasping the feet. Drill the perch and mount  the bird upon it. Position the legs, body, and head, and set the tail  as per Nature, to suit the position.    Adjust the plumage a little with tweezers. Compress the wings loosely to  the sides. If there is an unnatural hollowness between the shoulders,  lift the mane and at one side of it where the skin is bare, make a short  longitudinal incision. Through this place a little soft filling over and  between the shoulders to fill out hollowness. It is not necessary to sew  up this incision in a long feathered specimen.    Now settle down to the fascinating task of adjusting the feather tracts,  nicely manipulating the plumage, in places feather by feather, until  characteristic markings of the species are brought out in their normal  position as though the bird had just ruffled and then allowed the  feathers to settle back softly. Jewelers' tweezers are the finest thing  to be had for this work.    Return to the head. Pull the nape cord taut and tie it to neck-wire in  roof of mouth. Cut off the wire within the mouth so that the mandibles  close naturally. Tie the bill shut with cord or thread. It is necessary  in many specimens to thread the cord through the nostrils to accomplish  this.    To set the eyes, wipe a drop of liquid glue into the cotton of the eye  sockets and inside the lids, using a bit of wire for the purpose. Set  the eyes with regard to expression to suit the position, picking the  lids over their edges with needle and tweezers.    Pin, or tie with thread, the toes to grasp the perch.    Cut two pieces of thin cardboard for the tail. Curve them slightly.  Place one over and one under the long quills just clear of the coverts  and pin them through in two or three places to hold the quills even  until dry.    In mounting a specimen with spread wings, card the flight feathers full  length with curved strips, same as tail, then run a long sharpened wire  into the body under each wing and lay a loose bunch of cotton over it,  under the quills, to raise them and hold in proper"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#3)"],[1,"m, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went,  he gave his hours of freedom to reading and study in libraries and  museums.    During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he  conceived the idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and  of making the present translation. He commenced to gather all the  necessary material for this work, which included intensive studies of  the ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile, he continued his hotel work  also, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four he was assistant  manager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.    However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time  and study to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real  career. In Vienna he found music, drama, languages, history,  literature and gastronomy, and met interesting people from all parts  of the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest of his life,  he had a distaste for the \"superheated, aristocratic and military  atmosphere.\" It was at that city that he met the man who was  responsible for his coming to America. Were we writing Mr. Vehling's  biography, we would have ample material for a racy and startling  narrative. We desire only to indicate the remarkable preparation for  the work before us, which he has had. A Latin scholar of exceptional  promise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an artist  competent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be  anticipated? It is the combination that has made this book possible.    The book has claims even upon our busy and practical generation. Mr.  Vehling has himself stated them:        \"The important addition to our knowledge of the      ancients--for our popular notions about their table are      entirely erroneous and are in need of revision.        \"The practical value of many of the ancient formulae--for      'In Olde Things There is Newnesse.'        \"The human interest--because of the amazing mentality      and the culinary ingenuity of the ancients revealed to      us from an altogether new angle.        \"The curious novelty and the linguistic difficulty, the      philological interest and the unique nature of the task,      requiring unique prerequisites--all these factors      prompted us to undertake this translation.\"    One word as to Mr. Vehling's work in America. He was for five years  manager of catering at the Hotel Pfister in Milwaukee; for two and a  half years he was inspector and instructor of the Canadian Pacific  Railway; he was connected with some of the leading hotels in New York  City, and with the Eppley and the Van Orman Hotels chains, in  executive capacity. He not only has the practical side of food use and  preparation, he is an authority upon the science in his field. His  printed articles on food and cookery have been read with extraordinary  interest, and his lectures upon culinary matters have been well  received. It is to be hoped that both will eventually be published in  book form.    There is no financial lure in getting out an English translation of  Apicius. It is a labor of love--but worth the doing. We have claimed  that Mr. Vehling has exceptional fitness for the task. This will be  evident to anyone who reads his book. An interesting feature of his  preparation is the fact that Mr. Vehling has subjected many of the  formulae to actual test. As Dr. Lister in the old edition of 1705  increased the value and interest of the work by making additions from  various sources, so our editor of today adds much and interesting  matter in his supplements, notes and illustrations.    It is hardly expected that many will follow Mr. Vehling in testing the  Apician formulae. Hazlitt in speaking of \"The Young Cook's Monitor\"  which was printed in 1683, says:        \"Some of the ingredients proposed for sauces seem to our      ears rather prodigious. In one place a contemporary      peruser has inserted an ironical calculation in MS. to      the effect that, whereas a cod's head could be bought      for fourpence, the condiments recommended for it were      not to be had for less than nine shillings.\"    We shall close with a plagiarism oft repeated. It was a plagiarism as  long ago as 1736, when it was admitted such in the preface of Smith's  \"The Compleat Housewife\":        \"It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear      in public without a preface, as for a lady to appear at      a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to the      custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity.      The subject being both common and universal, needs no      argument to introduce it, and being so necessary for the      gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no      encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since      there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating      and drinking....\"    Old Apicius and Joseph Dommers Vehling really need no introduction.                                                     FREDERICK STARR      Seattle, Washington, August 3, 1926.          PREFACE      The present first translation into English of the ancient cookery book  dating back to Imperial Roman times known as the Apicius book is  herewith presented to antiquarians, friends of the Antique as well as  to gastronomers, friends of good cheer.    Three of the most ancient manuscript books that exist today bearing  the name of Apicius date back to the eighth and ninth century. Ever  since the invention of printing Apicius has been edited chiefly in the  Latin language. Details of the manuscript books and printed editions  will be found under the heading of Apiciana on the following pages.    The present version has been based chiefly upon three principal Latin  editions, that of Albanus Torinus, 1541, who had for his authority a  codex he found on the island of Megalona, on the editions of Martinus  Lister, 1705-9, who based his work upon that of Humelbergius, 1542,  and the Giarratano-Vollmer edition, 1922.    We have also scrutinized various other editions forming part of our  collection of Apiciana, and as shown by our \"family tree of Apicius\"  have drawn either directly or indirectly upon every known source for  our information.    The reasons and raison d'etre for this undertaking become sufficiently  clear through Dr. Starr's introduction and through the following  critical review.    It has been often said that the way to a man's heart is through his  stomach; so here is hoping that we may find a better way of knowing  old Rome and antique private life through the study of this cookery  book--Europe's oldest and Rome's only one in existence today.

THANKS      For many helpful hints, for access to works in their libraries and for  their kind and sympathetic interest in this work I am especially  grateful to Professor Dr. Edward Brandt, of Munich; to Professor Dr.  Margaret Barclay Wilson, of Washington, D.C., and New York City; to  Mr. Arnold Shircliffe, and Mr. Walter M. Hill, both of Chicago.                                                            J. D. V.      Chicago, in the Summer of 1936.

Then as now the oft quoted maxim stands that man is what he  eats.    Much of the ancient life is still shrouded and will forever be hidden  by envious forces that have covered up bygone glory and grandeur.  Ground into mealy dust under the hoofs of barbarian armies!  Re-modeled, re-used a hundred times! Discarded as of no value by  clumsy hands! The \"Crime of Ignorance\" is a factor in league with the  forces of destruction. Much is destroyed by blind strokes of  fate--fate, eternally pounding this earth in its everlasting enigmatic  efforts to shape life into something, the purpose of which we do not  understand, the meaning of which we may not even venture to dream of  or hope to know.    Whatever there has been preserved by \"Providence,\" by freaks of chance,  by virtue of its own inherent strength--whatever has been buried by  misers, fondled, treasured by loving hands of collectors and  connoisseurs during all these centuries--every speck of ancient dust,  every scrap of parchment or papyrus, a corroded piece of metal, a  broken piece of stone or glass, so eagerly sought by the archaeologists  and historians of the last few generations--all these fragmentary  messages from out of the past emphasize the greatness of their time.  They show its modernity, its nearness to our own days. They are now  hazy reminiscences, as it"]]]
