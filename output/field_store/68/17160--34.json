I have used outline  drawings in the text, as being more clear for purposes of explanation.  The dates given to the illustrations are to be taken as approximate to  the time in which the style was worn. Many of the photographs have been  arranged from my own costume collection, which has made so much of my  research simple, reliable, and pleasant. I am also happy to state that  before the final revision of this book I have heard that my collection  of historical costumes and accessories will, after a preliminary  exhibition at Messrs. Harrod's, be presented to the Victoria and Albert  Museum as a gift to the nation by the Directors of that firm. Thus the  actual dresses shown in these plates will find a permanent home in  London, and become valuable examples to students of costume. The  coiffures in the collotype plates are not to be judged as examples, for  it would have consumed far too much time to set up these figures more  perfectly, but all the bonnets, caps, and accessories given are genuine  examples.    In a book of this size, one cannot go into the designs of materials, &c.,  which is a study any earnest student would not neglect, but in this  connection I would draw attention to the comparative colour density and  proportion of designs chosen for various effects.    It has been my endeavour to arrange a greater variety of the forms which  make up the characters of each period, and also to give a wider  knowledge into the footwear, or details of the footwear, than is usual  in most costume books.    In a review of the styles I would not press any choice for building new  designs, as I believe in close individual research and selection, which  may utilise many interesting features from costume settings even in  periods which are almost scorned. I believe the purest beauty is found  in the simple forms of dress and decoration settings from the 12th to  the 15th centuries, schemed to the natural proportions of the figure.  The grace of line and movement is often aided by the short train, which  can be so happily caught up in many ways; the slight drag of the train  always keeps the front clear in outline, besides showing the movement of  the limbs. Length of fall in the material was desired, the figure  creating its own folds with every turn, but a belt was often placed  rather high under the breast. There is little reason with nature of  fine form to make dress into sections by a corset waist. A long, lithe,  complete curve in outline--much happier unbroken, except by the  girdle--is certainly the most artistically useful conception, not  breaking the rhythm (as does the harder belt), while it also induces  much beauty in lifting and arranging the drapery. The long falling  sleeve also has the same qualities, giving a greater fullness of shape,  a variety of colour (by a difference of lining), with a winglike motion,  besides softening the angle of the elbow.    I think the next garment for high esteem is the chasuble-shaped tunic  (with or without sleeves). Falling cleanly from the shoulders, it stops  at a charming length for the skirt to take up the flow of line. The  delightful effect of partly-laced or clasped sides was not missed by the  ablest designers. How refined, too, was the character of decoration of  the old period! The art of concentrating effects is seen to perfection,  retaining the breadth of shape and length unbroken. Jewelled embroidery  of fine enrichment was wrought on the borders, neck settings, square  corners, the girdle, and the clasps. The preciousness of effect was  truly appreciated by the enclosing of the face in the purity of white  lawn and zephyr-like veilings; the circlet and the long interlaced  plaits and charming nettings were all tastefully schemed. Has woman ever  looked more supreme through all the centuries of extravagant styles and  distortions? I believe not: but I have come to the conclusion that, at  whatever period of seeming insanity of style, the woman of fine taste  can overcome all obstacles by her individual choice and \"set up,\" and  has really always looked fascinating.    There was another form of decoration at this period--the cutting of the  edges into a variety of simple or foliated shapes, giving a flutter and  enrichment to forms in a simple manner, and this, in conjunction with  the increasing richness of materials, was a valuable aid to lighten the  effects. It was probably initiated by the heraldic characteristics in  vogue.    The pricked and slashed details had much the same result in enriching  surfaces.    Later the fan sleeves of the 18th century were enhanced in a similar way  by the curved and scalloped shaping, which was used as late as the  Victorian sixties with happy effect on the polonaises.    Now, as regards the finest corset dress, the palm must be given to the  sack-back dress of the eighteenth century (not in the period of its  distortion with hoops), and a full setting showed it to greatest  advantage.    This type of design lent itself to more variety in beauty of arrangement  than any other; the looping, reefing, and tying always set gracefully in  accord with the back fall. The easy exchange of the stomacher also gave  additional chance of effect, and the beauty of the fan-shaped sleeve,  with its lace falls at the elbow, was a delightful creation. How rich  and refined this character could be, without the monstrous forms and  head-dresses which later invaded it and turned it into ornate absurdity!    When we examine the period of Charles I, we find much charming dignity  in the adaptations of earlier inventions; the collar settings were  noble, indeed perfect, in arrangement, and the bodice decoration and  proportions most interesting.    For the grace of girlhood no dresses are happier than those of the early  19th century to 1830, and the inventions in trimmings through this  period were prolific in beauty and lightness of style.    Analysis of the many fashion-plates and original dresses of this  period will well repay all interested in beautiful needlecraft and dress  design. The arrangement of frills, insertions, gathered effects, applied  forms, and tasselled or buttoned additions, will be found full of beauty  and novelty, especially in the dresses of white embroidery. Plates XXIII  and XXIV (see pp. 218-231) give some happy examples of this time.    [Illustration: Plate I.--Boots and Shoes from the 14th to the 19th  Centuries.         1. Charles II.       2.

There are many dresses of real charm to be found amongst the mass of  heavy styles which must not be overlooked in studying design and style.  Even the crinoline dress, when treated with the exquisite silk gauzes,  as Fig. 3 in Plates XXXI and XXXIII (see pp. 270-282), was as alluring  as any woman could wish, and the original design of the jacket in the  latter figure, with its richly embroidered, long-skirted front cut short  at the back, arranged itself perfectly on this type of undersetting.  There was notable refinement of effect and beauty of proportion in many  dresses of the sixties, as exemplified in Fig. A, Plate XXXII (see p.  279), the waist being set rather high, and the very full skirt carried  back by the crinoline being held thus with its cross ties.          CHAPTER I      PREHISTORIC DRESS. FEMALE.    The woman's attire would have been chiefly a shortish skirt or wrap of  coarse linen, wool, or leather, gathered in front or folded at one hip;  grass cloth may also have been in use in most primitive tribes. Probably  the upper part of the body was kept bare, except for many ornaments and  necklaces, but a bodice or jacket cut in the same simple form as the  male shirt, with a heavy belt or girdle, would have been used, and  certainly a large shawl, which could be wrapped over the head and round  the figure during inclement hours. Dyed or painted patterns on the  cloths might well have been also in use, their chief designs being  stripes, circles or dots, zigzag lines, diamonds and plaid squares, rope  patterns and plaited patterns. The hair would have been loose, plaited,  or coiled on top, held by bone pins or circlets of bronze.      PREHISTORIC DRESS. MALE.    We have little description or illustration to certify the actual dress  of the early inhabitants of Britain, but we can draw conclusions with  pretty certain assurance, from the knowledge of their mode of living.  From their attainments in artistic design and handiwork, it is clear  they had arrived at a very high state of savage culture before the Roman  invasion; and we have only to study the better types of savage life  still in progress, to picture how our own primitive race would be likely  to dress under the conditions of climate. The thousands of \"finds,\"  which accumulate evidence every year, give us a closer acquaintance with  their customs and work. The rest we must imagine from our general  knowledge of what they had to contend with in climate, forest, cave, and  floods.    These early people, it is presumed from certain discoveries, had long  known the art of coarsely weaving flax and wool, which must soon have  been in general use, from its being healthier and cleaner than the  garments of skin. And very probably a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34949"],[0,"Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea (#3)"],[1,"side, but none was heard in a large lake  nearby or in adjacent fields. On May 15, 4 mi. ESE Ch'orwon,  approximately one hundred tadpoles, thought to be of this species,  congregated near a drain (into a lower field) of an unused rice field;  the tadpoles were well-developed, some having hind legs. The earliest  and latest dates of collection represented in our material are May 8 and  October 29. The call is best described as a raspy \"waak,\" \"week,\" or  \"wiick\" in the middle register.    The listing of \"Hylae arboreae var japonicae descript pars _Schleg. in  Fauna Japon._ p. 112 ...\" by G[:u]nther (1858:81) in synonymy under the  account of _Polypedates schlegelii_, implies that Schlegel was the first  author to use the name-combination _Hyla arborea japonica_. Boulenger  (1882:86, 381) went so far as to credit Schlegel as the author of the  name _japonica_. The reason for this action is not known because  Schlegel (in von Siebold, 1838:112) referred to this hylid only under  the name \"Hyla arborea.\"      =Rana rugosa= Schlegel        _Rana rugosa_ Schlegel, Reptilia [Saurii et Batrachii], _in_ von        Siebold, Fauna Japonica, p. 110, pl. 3, figs. 3-4, 1838 (type        locality designated as Japan, probably near Nagasaki, by        Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:123, July 22, 1907).        _Specimens examined_ (26).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 13 (KU), 1 (UMMZ); 2 mi. S Ch'orwon, 4 (KU); 2 mi. E      Hoengsong, 3 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU);      6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--_Rana rugosa_ was associated with _Rana nigromaculata_ and  _Rana amurensis coreana_ at all localities where the species was taken  save at 2 mi. E Hoengsong, where _R. a. coreana_ was not observed. Three  specimens of _R. rugosa_ were collected among grasses and reeds in  water along the edge of Ch'orwon Reservoir, 2 mi. S Ch'orwon, where they  were difficult to find in the thick vegetation even though their low,  soft calls were heard; the specimen from 1 mi. NW Oho-ri was found in a  rice field. Otherwise, habitats recorded indicate a preference for  small, fast-flowing streams, especially in wooded valleys. On one  occasion, individuals were found trapped in cement-walled pits about old  ruins on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest. The earliest  and latest dates of capture among our specimens are May 15 and November  6. In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed  4 mi. W Ch'ungju.    _R. rugosa_ may have an extensive breeding season as suggested by the  variation in size of frogs collected or observed in 1954. Of nine frogs  obtained on May 29, five ranged in snout-vent length from 26 to 28, and  four from 42 to 54. Three specimens collected on October 9 measured 39,  41, and 55, and two obtained on November 6 measured 25 and 37.      =Rana nigromaculata= Hallowell        _Rana nigromaculata_ Hallowell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,        [12]:500 (for 1860), 1861 (type locality, Simoda, Japan).        _Specimens examined_ (47).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 6 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch'orwon, 5 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch'ungju, 2      (KU); 7 mi. W Ch'ungju, 1 (KU); 2 mi. E Hoengsong, 1 (KU); 8 mi. SW      Kunsan, 1 (KU); 1 mi. NW Oho-ri, 5 (KU); 5 mi. ENE Pusan, 2 (KU); 5      mi. ESE Seoul, 9 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3 (KU), 10 (UMMZ); 6 mi. NNE      Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU).        _Description._--Back brownish or grayish (greenish in life), having      few, indistinct or well-defined, dark blotches, or extensive      blackish areas (representing fusion of markings); pale, middorsal      stripe (pale green, buff or yellowish in life) from snout to anus,      sometimes as wide as interorbital width, but indistinct or lacking      when pattern on back absent; blackish bar often present behind      tympanum; posterior surface of thigh mottled; underparts pale yellow      to whitish, sometimes having a few dusky marks on throat;      longitudinal ridges between dorsolateral folds indistinct in some      small frogs; largest female and male having respective snout-vent      lengths of 100 and 70.    _Remarks._--_Rana nigromaculata_ is the most abundant ranid in central  Korea and, in a general way, the ecological equivalent of _Rana pipiens_  in temperate North America. The species is associated with most aquatic  habitats, from rocky streams to rice fields and large impoundments. In  the vicinity of Seoul the din of large breeding congresses was heard  more or less continuously from mid-April to mid-May. Large numbers of  juveniles (approximately one inch long) were noticed first on July 8 and  were present thereafter for about three weeks, being commonest in  standing water after heavy rains or during prolonged showers. These data  and the different sizes of individuals collected at the same time  suggest either variable growth or, more probably, an extensive breeding  season. Our earliest and latest dates of collection are April 16 and  October 7. The Korean name for \"frog,\" most often applied to _R.  nigromaculata_, sounds something like \"keg-oh-ree.\" The call is a  prolonged, raspy, staccato croak, sometimes with a rising inflection at  the end.    In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed 5  mi. W Kwangju and 3 mi. S Osan.    Despite a high degree of individual variation, _Rana nigromaculata_  seemingly varies geographically as well; some subspecies probably should  be recognized, but the species as a whole has never been thoroughly  studied systematically. The division of _R. nigromaculata_ into three  subspecies by Schmidt (1927:563-567) was considered untenable by Fang  and Chang (1931:95-98), and it has been regarded by most recent authors  as a variable, monotypic species.    The named subspecies _R. n. chosenica_ (Okada, 1931:89, with type  locality at Seoul, and geographically restricted to Korea) was  considered a subspecies of _Rana plancyi_ by Shannon (1956:36). The most  trenchant characters of _plancyi_ seem to be the wide dorsolateral  folds, the uniform greenish dorsum, the presence of dermal pustules on  the back between the dorsolateral folds, and the lack of a mottled  pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. Among our specimens of  _R. nigromaculata_, the width of the dorsolateral folds is variable, a  uniform greenish dorsum is found only in large males, dermal pustules  are mixed with ridges in only one male (KU 38733), and all have a  spotted or mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. All of  our specimens having an indistinct pattern on the back, or lacking a  pattern, are males and resemble the photographs of males published by  Moriya (1954: pl. I, fig. 5) and Liu (1936: pl. IV, figs. 1-2);  juveniles of both sexes and large females have contrasting patterns.    None of our frogs seems, therefore, clearly referable to the species  _plancyi_, although some characters are suggestive of _plancyi_. Moriya  (_op. cit.:19_), who studied variation of _R. nigromaculata_ in Japan,  noted that one of the most distinct populations there (_R. n.  brevipoda_) resembled _Rana plancyi_. Ting (1939) discovered that  _nigromaculata_ and _plancyi_ were cross-fertile and raised hybrid  larvae through metamorphosis. Pope and Boring (1940) suggested  hybridization between the two species in eastern China, and the above  mentioned facts suggest to us the possibility of hybridization in other  regions.      =Rana amurensis coreana= Okada        _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Annot. Zool. Japon., 11:140        (footnote), July 25, 1927, _nomen nudum_.        _Rana temporaria coreana_ Okada, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist. Soc, 6:19,        pl. 1, fig. 7, 1928 (type locality, Keijo [= Seoul], Korea).        _Rana amurensis coreana_, Shannon, Herpetologica, 12:38, March 6,        1956.        _Specimens examined_ (9).--Central National Forest, near      Pup'yong-ni, 1 (KU); 2 mi. S Ch'orwon, 1 (KU); 4 mi. W Ch'ungju, 1      (KU); 1 mi. N Oho-ri, 1 (KU); 5 mi. ESE Seoul, 3 (KU); Yongp'yong, 2      (KU).    _Remarks._--One individual of _R. a. coreana_ (KU 38698) and one of  _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ (KU 38715) were collected on May 29 along a  stream in the Central National Forest in association with _R. rugosa_  and _R. nigromaculata_. Specimens of _coreana_ from the vicinity of  Seoul were found in rice fields. The earliest date of collection was  April 13 at Yongp'yong. Our largest specimen of _coreana_ measured 47 in  snout-vent length.    Because _R. a. coreana_ and _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ are sympatric in  central Korea and closely resemble one another, the two species were not  distinguished in the field and the following observations may pertain to  either (or both) species. Wood frogs were observed 2 mi. E Songdong-ni  on July 12 in paddies (rice fields) along with individuals of _Hyla  arborea_, _Rana rugosa_, and _Rana nigromaculata_. At Chip'o-ri on April  6, individuals (probably _R. t. dybowskii_) were seen in a seepage pool  from an abandoned rice field; _R. nigromaculata_ also was seen there.  Six or seven egg masses (some having small tadpoles) were observed in  the shallow water, but it was not certain to which species the eggs  belonged. Completely metamorphosed young (probably _R. a. coreana_) were  first seen 1 mi. N Oho-ri on June 9. At Taehoesan-ni on November 12,  several sluggish frogs were seen in a small pool that was covered by a  thin layer of ice.    On September 26 in the Central National Forest, many wood frogs of  various sizes were observed. _R. amurensis_ and _R. temporaria_ probably  have extended breeding seasons that correspond to those of _R. rugosa_  and _R. nigromaculata_. Judging from our observations, _amurensis_  prefers the proximity of water, whereas _temporaria_ may occur some  distance from permanent water.    In our specimens, _R. amurensis coreana_ differs from _R. temporaria  dybowskii_ in having (1) smaller maximal size, ("]]]
