Is it       that mere scenery, without history, is enjoyable without       being suggestive, or, amid the tumult of the rushing torrent       at one's feet, is the milk of thought too much agitated for       the cream to rise? I fancied yesterday, as I rested on the       softest rock I could find at the upper end of the ravine,       that I should tumble you out a letter to-day, with ideas       pitching forth like saw-logs over a waterfall; but my memory       has nothing in it to-day but the rocks and rapids it took       in--the talent wrapped in its napkin of delight remaining in       unimproved _statu-quo_-sity. One certainly gets the       impression, while the sight and hearing are so overwhelmed,       that one's mind is famously at work, and that we shall hear       from it to-morrow; but it is Jean Paul, I think, who says       that 'the mill makes the most noise when there is no grist       in the hopper.'         \"We have had the full of the moon and a cloudless sky for       the last two or three nights, and of course we have walked       the ravine till the 'small hours,' seeing with wonder the       transforming effects of moonlight and its black shadows on       the falls and precipices. I have no idea (you will be glad       to know) of trying to reproduce these sublimities on       paper--at least not with my travelling stock of verbs and       adjectives. To 'sandwich the moon in a muffin,' one must       have time and a ladder of dictionaries. But one or two       effects struck me which perhaps are worth briefly naming,       and I will throw into the lot a poetical figure, which you       may use in your next song....         \"The fourth Fall, (or the one that is flanked by the ruins       of a saw-mill) is, perhaps, a hundred feet across; and its       curve over the upper rock and its break upon the lower one,       form two parallel lines, the water everywhere falling the       same distance with the evenness of an artificial cascade.       The stream not being very full, just now, it came over, in       twenty or thirty places, thicker than elsewhere; and the       effect, from a distance, as the moonlight lay full upon it,       was that of twenty or thirty immovable marble columns       connected by transparent curtains of falling lace, and with       bases in imitation of foam. Now it struck me that this might       suggest a new and fanciful order of architecture, suitable       at least to the structure of green-houses, the glass roofs       of which are curved over and slope to the ground with very       much the contour of a waterfall....         \"Subterranean as this foaming river looks by day, it looks       like a river in cloud-land by night. The side of the ravine       which is in shadow, is one undistinguishable mass of black,       with its wavy upper edge in strong relief against the sky,       and, as the foaming stream catches the light from the       opposite and moonlit side, it is outlined distinctly on its       bed of darkness, and seems winding its way between hills of       clouds, half black, half luminous. Below, where all is deep       shadow except the river, you might fancy it a silver mine       laid open to your view amid subterranean darkness by the       wand of an enchanter, or (if you prefer a military trope, my       dear General), a long white plume laid lengthwise between       the ridges of a cocked hat.\"    [Illustration]          NEW PROOF OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION.      \"The earth does move, notwithstanding,\" whispered Galileo, leaving the  dungeon of the Inquisition: by which he meant his friends to  understand, that if the earth did move, the fact would remain so in  spite of his punishment. But a less orthodox assembly than the  conclave of Cardinals might have been staggered by the novelty of the  new philosophy. According to Laplace, the apparent diurnal phenomena  of the heavens would be the same either from the revolution of the sun  or the earth; and more than one reason made strongly in favor of the  prevalent opinion that the earth, not the sun, was stationary. First,  it was most agreeable to the impression of the senses; and next, to  disbelieve in the fixity of the solid globe, was not only to eject  from its pride of place our little planet, but to disturb the  long-cherished sentiment that we ourselves are the centre--the be-all  and end-all of the universe. However, the truth will out; and this is  its great distinction from error, that while every new discovery adds  to its strength, falsehood is weakened and at last driven from the  field. That the earth revolves round the sun, and rotates on its polar  axis, have long been the settled canons of our system. But the  rotation of the earth has been rendered _visible_ by a practical  demonstration, which has drawn much attention in Paris and London, and  is beginning to excite interest in this country. The inventor is M.  Foucault; and the following description has been given of the mode of  proof:         \"At the centre of the dome of the Pantheon a fine wire is       attached, from which a sphere of metal, four or five inches       in diameter, is suspended so as to hang near the floor of       the building. This apparatus is put in vibration after the       manner of a pendulum. Under and concentrical with it is       placed a circular table, some twenty feet in diameter, the       circumference of which is divided into degrees, minutes,       &c., and the divisions numbered. Now, supposing the earth to       have the diurnal motion imputed to it, and which explains       the phenomena of day and night, the plane in which this       pendulum vibrates will not be affected by this motion, but       the table, over which the pendulum is suspended, will       continually change its position, in virtue of the diurnal       motion, so as to make a complete revolution round its       centre. Since, then, the table thus revolves, and the       pendulum which vibrates over it does not revolve, the       consequence is, that a line traced upon the table by a point       projecting from the bottom of the ball will change its       direction relatively to the table from minute to minute and       from hour to hour, so that if such point were a pencil, and       that paper were spread upon the table, the course formed by       this pencil would form a system of lines radiating from the       centre of the table. The practised eye of a correct       observer, especially if aided by a proper optical       instrument, may actually see the motion which the table has       in common with the earth, under the pendulum between two       successive vibrations. It is, in fact, apparent that the       ball, or rather the point attached to the bottom of the       ball, does not return precisely to the same point of the       circumference of the table after two successive vibrations.       Thus is rendered visible the motion which the table has in       common with the earth.\"    Crowds are said to flock daily to the Pantheon to witness this  interesting experiment. It has been successfully repeated by Professor  Ansted at the Russell Institution, in London, in a manner similar to  the experiment at the Pantheon at Paris. The wire, which suspended a  weight of twenty-eight pounds, was of the size of the middle C-string  of a piano. It was thirty feet long, and vibrated over a graduated  table fixed to the floor. The rotation of the table, implying that of  the earth on which it rested, was visible in about five minutes, and  the wonderful spectacle was presented of the rotation of the room  round the pendulum. The experiment excited the astonishment of every  beholder, and many eminent scientific gentlemen who were present  expressed their great delight in witnessing a phenomenon which they  considered the most satisfactory they had witnessed in the whole  course of their lives.    Although nothing, to minds capable of comprehending it, can add to the  force or clearness of the demonstration by which the rotation of the  earth has been established, yet even the natural philosopher himself  cannot regard the present experiment without feelings of profound  interest and satisfaction; and to the great mass, to whom the  complicated physical phenomena by which the rotation of the earth has  been established are incomprehensible, M. Foucault's very ingenious  illustration is invaluable.    A correspondent of the Newark _Daily Advertiser_ appears to have  anticipated the experiment of M. Foucault, suspending a fifty-six  pound weight by a small wire from the rafters of a barn. But however  simple and conclusive the illustration, it should be attempted only by  scientific men. Professor Sylvester, writing to the _Times_, of  experiments made in London, says:         \"The experiments connected with the practical demonstration       of the phenomenon require to be conducted with great care;       and some discredit has been brought upon attempts to       illustrate it in England by persons who have not taken the       necessary precautions to protect the motion from the       excentric deviation to which it is liable, and which may,       and indeed must, have the effect of causing, in some cases,       an apparent failure, and in others a still more unfortunate,       because fallacious, success. I believe, from the character       of the persons connected with the experiments, that the true       phenomenon has been accurately produced and observed in       Paris.
