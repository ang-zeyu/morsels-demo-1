Many an impatient cavalier burned to achieve a  kindred fortune. To the excited fancy of the Spaniards the unknown land  of Florida seemed the seat of surpassing wealth, and Pamphilo de Narvaez  essayed to possess himself of its fancied treasures. Landing on  its shores, and proclaiming destruction to the Indians unless they  acknowledged the sovereignty of the Pope and the Emperor, he advanced  into the forests with three hundred men. Nothing could exceed their  sufferings. Nowhere could they find the gold they came to seek. The  village of Appalache, where they hoped to gain a rich booty, offered  nothing but a few mean wigwams. The horses gave out, and the famished  soldiers fed upon their flesh. The men sickened, and the Indians  unceasingly harassed their march. At length, after two hundred and  eighty leagues  [5] of wandering, they found themselves on the  northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and desperately put to sea in such  crazy boats as their skill and means could construct. Cold, disease,  famine, thirst, and the fury of the waves, melted them away. Narvaez  himself perished, and of his wretched followers no more than four  escaped, reaching by land, after years of vicissitude, the Christian  settlements of New Spain.  [6]    The interior of the vast country then comprehended under the name of  Florida still remained unexplored. The Spanish voyager, as his caravel  ploughed the adjacent seas, might give full scope to his imagination,  and dream that beyond the long, low margin of forest which bounded his  horizon lay hid a rich harvest for some future conqueror; perhaps a  second Mexico with its royal palace and sacred pyramids, or another  Cuzco with its temple of the Sun, encircled with a frieze of gold.  Haunted by such visions, the ocean chivalry of Spain could not long  stand idle.    Hernando de Soto was the companion of Pizarro in the conquest of Peru.  He had come to America a needy adventurer, with no other fortune than  his sword and target. But his exploits had given him fame and fortune,  and he appeared at court with the retinue of a nobleman. [7] Still,  his active energies could not endure repose, and his avarice and  ambition goaded him to fresh enterprises. He asked and obtained  permission to conquer Florida. While this design was in agitation,  Cabeca de Vaca, one of those who had survived the expedition of Narvaez,  appeared in Spain, and for purposes of his own spread abroad the  mischievous falsehood, that Florida was the richest country yet  discovered. De Soto's plans were embraced with enthusiasm. Nobles and  gentlemen contended for the privilege of joining his standard; and,  setting sail with an ample armament, he landed at the bay of Espiritu  Santo, now Tampa Bay, in Florida, with six hundred and twenty chosen  men, a band as gallant and well appointed, as eager in purpose and  audacious in hope, as ever trod the shores of the New World. The clangor  of trumpets, the neighing of horses, the fluttering of pennons, the  glittering of helmet and lance, startled the ancient forest with  unwonted greeting. Amid this pomp of chivalry, religion was not  forgotten. The sacred vessels and vestments with bread and wine for the  Eucharist were carefully provided; and De Soto himself declared that the  enterprise was undertaken for God alone, and seemed to be the object  of His especial care. These devout marauders could not neglect the  spiritual welfare of the Indians whom they had come to plunder; and  besides fetters to bind, and bloodhounds to hunt them, they brought  priests and monks for the saving of their souls.    The adventurers began their march. Their story has been often told. For  month after month and year after year, the procession of priests and  cavaliers, crossbowmen, arquebusiers, and Indian captives laden with  the baggage, still wandered on through wild and boundless wastes, lured  hither and thither by the ignis fatuus of their hopes. They traversed  great portions of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, everywhere  inflicting and enduring misery, but never approaching their phantom El  Dorado. At length, in the third year of their journeying, they reached  the banks of the Mississippi, a hundred and thirty-two years before its  second discovery by Marquette. One of their number describes the great  river as almost half a league wide, deep, rapid, and constantly rolling  down trees and drift-wood on its turbid current.    The Spaniards crossed over at a point above the mouth of the Arkansas.  They advanced westward, but found no treasures,--nothing indeed but  hardships, and an Indian enemy, furious, writes one of their officers,  \"as mad dogs.\" They heard of a country towards the north where maize  could not be cultivated because the vast herds of wild cattle devoured  it. They penetrated so far that they entered the range of the roving  prairie tribes; for, one day, as they pushed their way with difficulty  across great plains covered with tall, rank grass, they met a band of  savages who dwelt in lodges of skins sewed together, subsisting on game  alone, and wandering perpetually from place to place. Finding neither  gold nor the South Sea, for both of which they had hoped, they returned  to the banks of the Mississippi.    De Soto, says one of those who accompanied him, was a \"stern man, and of  few words.\" Even in the midst of reverses, his will had been law to  his followers, and he had sustained himself through the depths of  disappointment with the energy of a stubborn pride. But his hour was  come. He fell into deep dejection, followed by an attack of fever, and  soon after died miserably. To preserve his body from the Indians, his  followers sank it at midnight in the river, and the sullen waters of the  Mississippi buried his ambition and his hopes.    The adventurers were now, with few exceptions, disgusted with the  enterprise, and longed only to escape from the scene of their miseries.  After a vain attempt to reach Mexico by land, they again turned back  to the Mississippi, and labored, with all the resources which their  desperate necessity could suggest, to construct vessels in which they  might make their way to some Christian settlement. Their condition was  most forlorn. Few of their horses remained alive; their baggage had been  destroyed at the burning of the Indian town of Mavila, and many of the  soldiers were without armor and without weapons. In place of the gallant  array which, more than three years before, had left the harbor of  Espiritu Santo, a company of sickly and starving men were laboring among  the swampy forests of the Mississippi, some clad in skins, and some in  mats woven from a kind of wild vine.    Seven brigantines were finished and launched; and, trusting their lives  on board these frail vessels, they descended the Mississippi, running  the gantlet between hostile tribes, who fiercely attacked them. Reaching  the Gulf, though not without the loss of eleven of their number, they  made sail for the Spanish settlement on the river Panuco, where they  arrived safely, and where the inhabitants met them with a cordial  welcome. Three hundred and eleven men thus escaped with life, leaving  behind them the bones of their comrades strewn broadcast through the  wilderness.  [7]    De Soto's fate proved an insufficient warning, for those were still  found who begged a fresh commission for the conquest of Florida; but the  Emperor would not hear them. A more pacific enterprise was undertaken  by Cancello, a Dominican monk, who with several brother ecclesiastics  undertook to convert the natives to the true faith, but was murdered in  the attempt. Nine years later, a plan was formed for the colonization of  Florida, and Guido de las Bazares sailed to explore the coasts, and  find a spot suitable for the establishment. [8] After his return, a  squadron, commanded by Angel de Villafane, and freighted with supplies  and men, put to sea from San Juan d'Ulloa; but the elements were  adverse, and the result was a total failure. Not a Spaniard had yet  gained foothold in Florida.    That name, as the Spaniards of that day understood it, comprehended the  whole country extending from the Atlantic on the east to the longitude  of New Mexico on the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico and the River of  Palms indefinitely northward towards the polar sea. This vast territory  was claimed by Spain in right of the discoveries of Columbus, the  grant of the Pope, and the various expeditions mentioned above. England  claimed it in right of the discoveries of Cabot; while France could  advance no better title than might be derived from the voyage of  Verazzano and vague traditions of earlier visits of Breton adventurers.    With restless jealousy Spain watched the domain which she could not  occupy, and on France especially she kept an eye of deep distrust. When,  in 1541, Cartier and Roberval essayed to plant a colony in the part of  ancient Spanish Florida now called Canada, she sent spies and fitted  out caravels to watch that abortive enterprise. Her fears proved just.  Canada, indeed, was long to remain a solitude; but, despite the Papal  bounty gifting Spain with exclusive ownership of a hemisphere, France  and Heresy at length took root in the sultry forests of modern Florida.            CHAPTER II    1550-1558.    VILLEGAGNON.    In the middle of the sixteenth century, Spain was the incubus of Europe.  Gloomy and portentous, she chilled the world with her baneful shadow.  Her old feudal liberties were gone, absorbed in the despotism of Madrid.  A tyranny of monks and inquisitors, with their swarms of spies and  informers, their racks, their dungeons, and their fagots, crushed all  freedom of thought or speech; and, while the Dominican held his reign  of terror and force, the deeper Jesuit guided the mind from infancy  into those narrow depths of bigotry from which it was never to escape.  Commercial despotism was joined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#3)"],[1,"prolific vocabulary, he  called his first mate.    \"Mr. Gross,\" he said, \"the damned renegades are gone. Do you think you  can find them?\"    Long experience in the vicissitudes of life, acquired in that best  school of all, the forecastle, had taught Peter Gross the folly of  saying, \"I told you so.\" Therefore he merely replied:    \"I'll try, sir.\"    So it befell that he sought news of the missing ones at the great white  _stadhuis_, where the Heer Sachsen, always his friend, met him and  conceived the inspiration for his prompt recommendation to the  governor-general.    Peter Gross ambled on toward Ah Sing's _rumah makan_ without the  slightest suspicion he was being followed. On his part, Governor-General  Van Schouten was content to let his quarry walk on unconscious of  observation while he measured the man.    \"God in Israel, what a man!\" his excellency exclaimed admiringly, noting  Peter Gross's broad shoulders and stalwart thighs. \"If he packs as much  brains inside his skull as he does meat on his bones, there are some  busy days ahead for my Dyaks.\" He smacked his lips in happy  anticipation.    Ah Sing's grog-shop, with its colonnades and porticoes and fussy gables  and fantastic cornices terminating in pigtail curlicues, was a squalid  place for all the ornamentation cluttered on it. Peter Gross observed  its rubbishy surroundings with ill-concealed disgust.    \"'Twould be a better Batavia if some one set fire to the place,\" he  muttered to himself. \"Yet the law would call it arson.\"    Looking up, he saw Ah Sing seated in one of the porticoes, and quickly  masked his face to a smile of cordial greeting, but not before the  Chinaman had detected his ill humor.    There was a touch of three continents in Ah Sing's appearance. He sat  beside a table, in the American fashion; he smoked a long-stemmed  hookah, after the Turkish fashion, and he wore his clothes after the  Chinese fashion. The bland innocence of his pudgy face and the seraphic  mildness of his unblinking almond eyes that peeped through slits no  wider than the streak of a charcoal-pencil were as the guilelessness of  Mother Eve in the garden. Motionless as a Buddha idol he sat, except for  occasional pulls at the hookah.    \"Good-morning, Ah Sing,\" Peter Gross remarked happily, as he mounted the  colonnade.    The tiny slits through which Ah Sing beheld the pageantry of a sun-baked  world opened a trifle wider.    \"May Allah bless thee, Mr. Gross,\" he greeted impassively.    Peter Gross pulled a chair away from one of the other tables and placed  it across the board from Ah Sing. Then he succumbed to it with a sigh of  gentle ease.    \"A hot day,\" he panted, and fanned himself as though he found the  humidity unbearable.    \"Belly hot,\" Ah Sing gravely agreed in a guttural voice that sounded  from unfathomable abysses.    \"A hot day for a man that's tasted no liquor for nigh three months,\"  Peter Gross amended.    \"You makee long trip?\" Ah Sing inquired politely.    Peter Gross's features molded themselves into an expression eloquently  appreciative of his past miseries.    \"That's altogether how you take it, Ah Sing,\" he replied. \"From Frisco  to Melbourne to Batavia isn't such a thunderin' long ways, not to a man  that's done the full circle three times. But when you make the voyage  with a Methodist captain who doesn't believe in grog, it's the longest  since Captain Cook's. Ah Sing, my throat's dryer than a sou'east  monsoon. Hot toddy for two.\"    Ah Sing clapped his hands and uttered a magic word or two in Chinese. A  Cantonese waiter paddled swiftly outside, bearing a lacquered tray and  two steaming glasses. One he placed before Ah Sing and the other before  Peter Gross, who tossed a coin on the table.    \"Pledge your health, sir,\" Peter Gross remarked and reached across the  board to clink glasses with his Chinese friend. Ah Sing lifted his glass  to meet the sailor's and suddenly found it snaked out of his hands by a  deft motion of Peter Gross's middle finger. Gross slid his own glass  across the table toward Ah Sing.    \"If you don't mind,\" he remarked pleasantly. \"Your waiter might have  mistaken me for a plain A. B., and I've got to get back to my ship  to-night.\"    Ah Sing's bland and placid face remained expressionless as a carved  god's. But he left the glass stand, untasted, beside him.    The _Coryander's_ mate sipped his liquor and sank deeper into his chair.  He studied with an air of affectionate interest the long lane of  quaintly colonnaded buildings that edged the city within a city, the  Chinese campong. Pigtailed Orientals, unmindful of the steaming heat,  squirmed across the scenery. Ten thousand stenches were compounded into  one, in which the flavor of garlic predominated. Peter Gross breathed  the heavy air with a smile of reminiscent pleasure and dropped another  notch into the chair.    \"It feels good to be back ashore again for a spell, Ah Sing,\" he  remarked. \"A nice, cool spot like this, with nothing to do and some of  your grog under the belt, skins a blistery deck any day. I don't wonder  so many salts put up here.\"    Back of the curtain of fat through which they peered, Ah Sing's oblique  eyes quivered a trifle as they watched the sailor keenly.    \"By the way,\" Peter Gross observed, stretching his long legs out to the  limit of their reach, \"you haven't seen any of my men, have you? Smith,  he's pock-marked and has a cut over his right eye; Jacobson, a tall  Swede, and Le Beouf, a little Frenchman with a close-clipped black  mustache and beard?\"    Ah Sing gravely cudgeled his memory.    \"None of your men,\" he assured, \"was here.\"    Peter Gross's face fell.    \"That's too bad!\" he exclaimed in evident disappointment. \"I thought  sure I'd find 'em here. You're sure you haven't overlooked them? That  Frenchie might call for a hop; we picked him out of a hop-joint at  Frisco.\"    \"None your men here,\" Ah Sing repeated gutturally.    Peter Gross rumpled his tousled hair in perplexity.    \"We-el,\" he drawled unhappily, \"if those chaps don't get back on  shipboard by nightfall I'll have to buy some men from you, Ah Sing. Have  y' got three good hands that know one rope from another?\"    \"Two men off schooner _Marianna_,\" Ah Sing replied in his same thick  monotone. \"One man, steamer _Callee-opie_. Good strong man. Work hard.\"    \"You stole 'em, I s'pose?\" Peter Gross asked pleasantly.    Ah Sing's heavy jowls waggled in gentle negation.    \"No stealum man,\" he denied quietly. \"Him belly sick. Come here, get  well. Allie big, strong man.\"    \"How much a head?\"    \"Twlenty dlolla.\"    \"F. O. B. the _Coryander_ and no extra charges?\"    Ah Sing's inscrutable face screwed itself into a maze of unreadable  wrinkles and lines.    \"Him eat heap,\" he announced. \"Five dlolla more for board.\"    \"You go to blazes,\" Peter Gross replied cheerfully. \"I'll look up a  couple of men somewhere else or go short-handed if I have to.\"    Ah Sing made no reply and his impassive face did not alter its  expressionless fixity. Peter Gross lazily pulled himself up in his chair  and extended his right hand across the table. A ring with a big  bloodstone in the center, a bloodstone cunningly chiseled and marked,  rested on the middle finger.    \"See that ring, Ah Sing?\" he asked. \"I got that down to Mauritius. What  d'ye think it's worth?\"    Ah Sing's long, claw-like fingers groped avariciously toward the ring.  His tiny, fat-encased eyes gleamed with cupidity.    With a quick, cat-like movement, Peter Gross gripped one of the  Chinaman's hands.    \"Don't pull,\" he cautioned quickly as Ah Sing tried to draw his hand  away. \"I was going to tell you that there's a drop of adder's poison  inside the bloodstone that runs down a little hollow pin if you press  the stone just so--\" He moved to illustrate.    \"No! No!\" Ah Sing shrieked pig-like squeals of terror.    \"Just send one of your boys for my salts, will you?\" Peter Gross  requested pleasantly. \"I understand they got here yesterday morning and  haven't been seen to leave. Talk English--no China talk, savvy?\"    A flash of malevolent fury broke Ah Sing's mask of impassivity. The rage  his face expressed caused Peter Gross to grip his hand the harder and  look quickly around for a possible danger from behind. They were alone.  Peter Gross moved a finger toward the stone, and Ah Sing capitulated. At  his shrill cry there was a hurried rustle from within. Peter Gross kept  close grip on the Chinaman's hand until he heard the shuffling tramp of  sailor feet. Smith, Jacobson and Le Beouf, blinking sleepily, were  herded on the portico by two giant Thibetans.    Peter Gross shoved the table and Ah Sing violently back and leaped to  his feet.    \"You'll--desert--will you?\" he exclaimed. Each word was punctuated by a  swift punch on the chin of one of the unlucky sailors and an echoing  thud on the floor. Smith, Jacobson, and Le Beouf lay neatly cross-piled  on one of Ah Sing's broken chairs.    \"I'll pay for the chair,\" Peter Gross declared, jerking his men to their  feet and shoving them down the steps.    Ah Sing shrilled an order in Chinese. The Thibetan giants leaped for  Peter Gross, who sprang out of their reach and put his back to the wall.  In his right hand a gun flashed.    \"Ah Sing, I'll take you first,\" he shouted.    The screen separating them from the adjoining portico was violently  pushed aside.    \"Ah Sing!\" exclaimed a sharp, authoritative voice.    Ah Sing looked about, startled. The purpled fury his face expressed  sickened to a mottled gray. Adriaan Adriaanszoon Van Schouten,  governor-general of Java, leaning lightly on his cane, frowned sternly  at the scene of disorder. At a cry from their master the two Thibetans  backed away from Peter Gross, who lowered his weapon.    \"Is it thus you observe our laws, Ah Sing?\" Van Schouten demanded  coldly.    Ah Sing licked his lips. \"Light of the sun--\" he began, but the governor  interrupted shortly:    \"The"]]]
