Bread and salt meat he smelled at, but would  not taste: all our liquors he treated in the same manner, and could drink  nothing but water. On being shown that he was not to wipe his hands on the  chair which he sat upon, he used a towel which was gave to him, with great  cleanliness and decency.    In the afternoon his hair was closely cut, his head combed, and his beard  shaved; but he would not submit to these operations until he had seen them  performed on another person, when he readily acquiesced. His hair, as might  be supposed, was filled with vermin, whose destruction seemed to afford him  great triumph; nay, either revenge, or pleasure, prompted him to eat them!  but on our expressing disgust and abhorrence he left it off.    To this succeeded his immersion in a tub of water and soap, where he was  completely washed and scrubbed from head to foot; after which a shirt,  a jacket, and a pair of trousers, were put upon him. Some part of this  ablution I had the honour to perform, in order that I might ascertain the  real colour of the skin of these people. My observation then was (and it  has since been confirmed in a thousand other instances) that they are as  black as the lighter cast of the African negroes.    Many unsuccessful attempts were made to learn his name; the governor  therefore called him Manly, from the cove in which he was captured: this  cove had received its name from the manly undaunted behaviour of a party of  natives seen there, on our taking possession of the country.    To prevent his escape, a handcuff with a rope attached to it, was fastened  around his left wrist, which at first highly delighted him; he called it  'bengadee' (or ornament), but his delight changed to rage and hatred when  he discovered its use. His supper he cooked himself: some fish were given  to him for this purpose, which, without any previous preparation whatever,  he threw carelessly on the fire, and when they became warm took them up,  and first rubbed off the scales, peeled the outside with his teeth, and ate  it; afterwards he gutted them, and laying them again on the fire, completed  the dressing, and ate them.    A convict was selected to sleep with him, and to attend him wherever he  might go. When he went with his keeper into his apartment he appeared very  restless and uneasy while a light was kept in; but on its extinction, he  immediately lay down and composed himself.    Sullenness and dejection strongly marked his countenance on the  following morning; to amuse him, he was taken around the camp, and to the  observatory: casting his eyes to the opposite shore from the point where  he stood, and seeing the smoke of fire lighted by his countrymen, he looked  earnestly at it, and sighing deeply two or three times, uttered the word  'gweeun' (fire).    His loss of spirits had not, however, the effect of impairing his appetite;  eight fish, each weighing about a pound, constituted his breakfast, which  he dressed as before. When he had finished his repast, he turned his back  to the fire in a musing posture, and crept so close to it, that his shirt  was caught by the flame; luckily his keeper soon extinguished it; but he  was so terrified at the accident, that he was with difficulty persuaded to  put on a second.    1st. January, 1789. To-day being new-year's-day, most of the officers were  invited to the governor's table: Manly dined heartily on fish and roasted  pork; he was seated on a chest near a window, out of which, when he had  done eating, he would have thrown his plate, had he not been prevented:  during dinner-time a band of music played in an adjoining apartment; and  after the cloth was removed, one of the company sang in a very soft  and superior style; but the powers of melody were lost on Manly, which  disappointed our expectations, as he had before shown pleasure and  readiness in imitating our tunes. Stretched out on his chest, and putting  his hat under his head, he fell asleep.    To convince his countrymen that he had received no injury from us, the  governor took him in a boat down the harbour, that they might see and  converse with him: when the boat arrived, and lay at a little distance  from the beach, several Indians who had retired at her approach, on seeing  Manly, returned: he was greatly affected, and shed tears. At length they  began to converse. Our ignorance of the language prevented us from knowing  much of what passed; it was, however, easily understood that his friends  asked him why he did not jump overboard, and rejoin them. He only sighed,  and pointed to the fetter on his leg, by which he was bound.    In going down the harbour he had described the names by which they  distinguish its numerous creeks and headlands: he was now often heard to  repeat that of 'Weerong' (Sydney Cove), which was doubtless to inform his  countrymen of the place of his captivity; and perhaps invite them to rescue  him. By this time his gloom was chased away, and he parted from his friends  without testifying reluctance. His vivacity and good humour continued all  the evening, and produced so good an effect on his appetite, that he ate  for supper two kangaroo rats, each of the size of a moderate rabbit, and in  addition not less than three pounds of fish.    Two days after he was taken on a similar excursion; but to our surprise the  natives kept aloof, and would neither approach the shore, or discourse with  their countryman: we could get no explanation of this difficulty, which  seemed to affect us more than it did him. Uncourteous as they were, he  performed to them an act of attentive benevolence; seeing a basket made  of bark, used by them to carry water, he conveyed into it two hawks and  another bird, which the people in the boat had shot, and carefully covering  them over, left them as a present to his old friends. But indeed the  gentleness and humanity of his disposition frequently displayed themselves:  when our children, stimulated by wanton curiosity, used to flock around  him, he never failed to fondle them, and, if he were eating at the time,  constantly offered them the choicest part of his fare.    February, 1789. His reserve, from want of confidence in us, continued  gradually to wear away: he told us his name, and Manly gave place to  Arabanoo. Bread he began to relish; and tea he drank with avidity:  strong liquors he would never taste, turning from them with disgust and  abhorrence. Our dogs and cats had ceased to be objects of fear, and were  become his greatest pets, and constant companions at table. One of our  chief amusements, after the cloth was removed, was to make him repeat the  names of things in his language, which he never hesitated to do with  the utmost alacrity, correcting our pronunciation when erroneous. Much  information relating to the customs and manners of his country was also  gained from him: but as this subject will be separately and amply treated,  I shall not anticipate myself by partially touching on it here.    On the 2nd of February died Captain John Shea of the marines, after a  lingering illness: he was interred on the following day, with the customary  military honours, amidst the regret of all who knew him. In consequence of  his decease, appointments for the promotion of the oldest officer of  each subordinate rank were signed by the major commandant of the marine  battalion, until the pleasure of the lords of the admiralty should be  notified.*    [*These appointments were confirmed by the admiralty.]    On the 17th of February the 'Supply' again sailed for Norfolk Island. The  governor went down the harbour in her, and carried Arabanoo with him, who  was observed to go on board with distrust and reluctance; when he found she  was under sail, every effort was tried without success to exhilarate him;  at length, an opportunity being presented, he plunged overboard, and struck  out for the nearest shore: believing that those who were left behind would  fire at him, he attempted to dive, at which he was known to be very expert:  but this was attended with a difficulty which he had not foreseen: his  clothes proved so buoyant, that he was unable to get more than his head  under water: a boat was immediately dispatched after him, and picked him  up, though not without struggles and resistance on his side. When brought  on board, he appeared neither afraid or ashamed of what he had done, but  sat apart, melancholy and dispirited, and continued so until he saw the  governor and his other friends descend into a boat, and heard himself  called upon to accompany them: he sprang forward, and his cheerfulness and  alacrity of temper immediately returned, and lasted during the remainder of  the day. The dread of being carried away, on an element of whose boundary  he could form no conception, joined to the uncertainty of our intention  towards him, unquestionably caused him to act as he did.    One of the principal effects which we had supposed the seizure and  captivity of Arabanoo would produce, seemed yet at as great a distance as  ever; the natives neither manifested signs of increased hostility on his  account, or attempted to ask any explanation of our conduct through the  medium of their countryman who was in our possession, and who they knew was  treated with no farther harshness than in being detained among us. Their  forbearance of open and determined attack upon can be accounted for only  by recollecting their knowledge of our numbers, and their dread of our  fire-arms: that they wanted not sufficient provocation to do so, will  appear from what I am about to relate.    March, 1789. Sixteen convicts left their work at the brick-kilns without  leave, and marched to Botany Bay, with a design to attack the natives,  and to plunder them of their fishing-tackle and spears: they had armed  themselves with their working tools and large clubs. When they arrived near  the bay, a body of Indians, who had probably seen them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#3)"],[1,"that has yet been erected in the cities of the United States. How easily  Broadway, for the money that its piles of brick and stone will have cost  in ten years, might be made the most splendid street in Christendom, by  a mere observance of the principles of taste and unity!    [Illustration: PRINCIPAL HALL OF PETERSON & HUMPHREY'S CARPET HOUSE.]    In a little hamlet of five or fifteen hundred inhabitants, great  buildings are out of place. In a city like ours, every thing should be  in keeping, and the predominant principle should be the _gigantesque_.  If the lot-holders from Bowling Green to the New Park would but consider  the matter, with intelligent reference not only to the glory of the city  but to their own profit; if each separate square were built as if it  were _one_ edifice (as, without any blending of property, it might be  very easily), though these squares were all of plain brick, and no more  costly than the well-known row of stores in William-street, what an  imposing spectacle they would present! But if one block were like the  Astor House, the next like Stewart's (except only the Reade street  front), the next a row of free-stone, the next one of brick, the next  one of granite,--here a Gothic, there a Byzantine, then a Corinthian,  then, if you please, as plain a front as that of the New-York  Hotel--with here and there a church, library, lyceum, or art gallery, of  a style less suitable for shops or dwellings,--and there would be  nothing in the world to compare with Broadway. But this running of  democracy into the ground, this whim of every vulgar fellow who owns a  front of twenty feet, that he must illustrate his independence by  building on it in his own peculiar way, is baulking Providence, and for  the full cost of magnificence confining us to tricksy meanness. Two or  three years ago rose the chaste and simple front of 349 Broadway, in a  row of decayed brick shops, which, it was hoped would give place to an  entire range in imitation of the initial structure. But since then, the  owner of a couple of adjoining lots--a Connecticut man probably--has  caused to be put up two stores of a different style, not of half the  value of continuations of the less expensive edifice which they join. If  instead of this patchwork, now planted here for half a century, there  had been an extension of uniform stores from corner to corner--though  either Beck's or the building we have mentioned had been the model--the  single splendid edifice would have been a pride and boast of the city,  and the separate stores would have been of much greater value than the  best can be now. It is as revolting (and much more vexatious, for its  publicity) as the worst case of Saxon and Congo amalgamation. A  magnificent pile has been erected in Wall-street on the corner west of  the Exchange; but some person, ignorant, it is to be hoped for his  soul's sake, of the true obligations of morality applicable in the case,  has built, at the same time, at the same cost, of the same height, and  without any conceivable justifying reason, an utterly incongruous basket  of offices, as if for the special purpose of vexing the eyes of men who  have instincts of decency.    [Illustration: THOMPSON'S SALOON.]    The imposing edifice on the corner of Broadway and White-street, of  which a view is presented on a preceding page, is one of the  improvements of the city made during the last year. In the great  carpet-house of Peterson & Humphrey are offered the productions of the  best looms in the world, in a variety and profusion probably unequalled  elsewhere in America. The principal saloon is like a street, and it is  almost always thronged with people.    Not far from the store of Peterson & Humphrey--at 359 Broadway--is the  new and beautiful building erected by the well-known confectioners,  Thompson & Son. This was opened to the public but a few weeks ago, and  it is the most splendid establishment of the kind in America. The  several sales during the last three quarters of a century of the ground  upon which it is built, illustrate the rapid increase of value in real  estate in this city during that period. The lot formed a part of the De  Peyster farm, and was called pasture ground. On the death of Major De  Peyster, the farm was divided, and this lot, then thirty-two feet wide,  was on the 13th of December, 1784, sold for L100 New-York currency; in  1789 it was sold for L150; in 1805 for $1500; in 1820 for $4000; in 1825  for $11,000; and in 1850 it was bought by Mr. Thompson for $60,000, and  he has expended $50,000 in the erection of the building with which it is  now occupied, and which is twenty-eight feet wide, one hundred and  ninety feet deep, and sixty-two feet high. It is built in a very rich  style, of Paterson stone, similar to that used in Trinity church. The  architects were Field and Correja, and the decorations in fresco are by  Rossini. Mr. Thompson, senior, has been a quarter of a century in the  business for which he has erected this new edifice, and in which he has  accumulated his fortune. In 1820 there were but one or two houses of  the kind in New-York, and these were of limited capacity and in every  way inferior to Taylor's, Weller's, or Thompson's, of the present day.  These are among the most luxurious and comfortable resorts for ladies  and gentlemen who visit the city but for a part of a day, or who have  not time or inclination to go to houses in distant parts of the town, to  lunch or dine, or for those who come down Broadway to do shopping, and  need a resting place, or enjoy an exchange for gossip.    [Illustration: PRINCIPAL SALOON AT THOMPSON'S.]    The next of the Palaces of Trade recently erected in the city, for which  we have now room for any description, is the great silk house of the  well-known merchants, Bowen & McNamee, constituting one of the most  attractive features of the lower part of Broadway. It is built of white  marble, and the style of architecture is Elizabethan, and peculiarly  elaborate and effective. The building is thirty-seven and a half feet  wide, one hundred and forty-seven deep, and four stories high; and each  story consists of a single unbroken hall, lined with the richest  English, German, French, Italian and Indian goods. The architect was Mr.  Joseph C. Wells, and his plans were used in all the minutest details of  ornament and furniture. It is regarded, we believe, as the greatest  triumph of its kind of which our commercial metropolis has to boast;  indeed in magnificence of design, beauty of execution, and perfect  adaptation to its purposes, there is nothing superior to it, probably,  among the buildings devoted to trade in all the world.    It was said by Jefferson that the genius of Architecture would never  make her abode in America; but the new edifices in New-York, of which we  have described some prominent specimens, may lead others to a different  conclusion. And we are of opinion that the progress of this country, in  the last quarter of a century, has been less conspicuous in any thing  else than in this noble art, little as it is now understood, much as it  is still disregarded. In some recent speculations on the subject, the  _Tribune_ observes:    \"There is no American architecture, unless the Lowell factories may be  regarded as such. Our churches are small and imperfect imitations of a  miscellaneous Gothic, and our exchanges, colleges, lyceums, banks and  custom-houses affect the Greek, with as much propriety as our merchants,  professors and clerks would indue themselves with the Athenian costume.  There is no hope of the churches and banks. They are nothing if not  Gothic and Grecian. We shall not discuss the probable character of our  architecture. It is clear that New-York will build brick houses, and in  blocks. But beauty costs no more than ugliness, and although every man  has the right to build a house of that appearance which best pleases  himself, yet every citizen is bound to have at heart the beauty of the  city. He cannot escape it. His pride compels it; and therefore every man  who builds a house ought to consult, to some extent, the general effect  of his building, and as he would not paint it blue or black, he should  no less consider its form than its color.    \"Cheapness and convenience will, of course, be the first principles in  our building, beauty and picturesqueness will be secondary. The point is  to combine these without much compromising either. At present our cities  are the unhandsomest in the world. The street architecture is monotonous  and heavy. The houses, compared with those of other capitals, are low,  but they are not light. Paris and the Italian cities have always a  festal air. Vienna is brilliant. Even grim old Rome seems waiting to be  gay. You do not immediately see the reason of this. The houses are high,  the streets narrow, shutting out the sky, and the swarms of passengers  do not explain the charm. But if you look narrowly you will see that the  difference of effect produced, arises, not so much from any essential  architectural superiority; because the mass of building in any city is  of about the same general character--but that it is due to the \"broken  and various lines which every where meet the eye, relieving the heavy  gravity of the smooth fronts which with us are entirely unrelieved.  Sometimes, indeed, a street is built with regard to its architectural  beauty, as the _Rue de Rivoli_, in Paris, of which the harmony is  uniformity and not monotony. One side of this street is the garden of  the Tuileries, and the other is like a prolonged palace front. The  northern side of the _Boulevards des Italiens_ is truly picturesque, but  for directly the contrary reason--the infinite variety of line  presented.
