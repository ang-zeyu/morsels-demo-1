He had come in, a few minutes  earlier, from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of Building  257 from across the square of asphalt known as the Alden Village Green.  He had called a cleaning woman to come straighten the place up, then had  hired the best lawyer in town to get his descendants a conviction, a  genius who had never gotten a client less than a year and a day. Gramps  had then moved the daybed before the television screen, so that he could  watch from a reclining position. It was something he'd dreamed of doing  for years.    \"Schen-_ec_-ta-dy,\" murmured Gramps. \"Got it!\" His face had changed  remarkably. His facial muscles seemed to have relaxed, revealing  kindness and equanimity under what had been taut lines of bad temper. It  was almost as though his trial package of _Super_-anti-gerasone had  already arrived. When something amused him on television, he smiled  easily, rather than barely managing to lengthen the thin line of his  mouth a millimeter.    Life was good. He could hardly wait to see what was going to happen  next.                                                      --KURT VONNEGUT, JR.

They have been on the wing all  day, and yet now they seem as tireless as the wind, and as if unable  to curb their powers.    One fall they gathered in this way and took refuge for the night in a  large chimney-stack in a city near me, for more than a month and a  half. Several times I went to town to witness the spectacle, and a  spectacle it was: ten thousand of them, I should think, filling the  air above a whole square like a whirling swarm of huge black bees, but  saluting the ear with a multitudinous chippering, instead of a  humming. People gathered upon the sidewalks to see them. It was a rare  circus performance, free to all. After a great many feints and playful  approaches, the whirling ring of birds would suddenly grow denser  above the chimney; then a stream of them, as if drawn down by some  power of suction, would pour into the opening. For only a few seconds  would this downward rush continue; then, as if the spirit of frolic  had again got the upper hand of them, the ring would rise, and the  chippering and circling go on. In a minute or two the same manoeuvre  would be repeated, the chimney, as it were, taking its swallows at  intervals to prevent choking. It usually took a half-hour or more for  the birds all to disappear down its capacious throat. There was always  an air of timidity and irresolution about their approach to the  chimney, just as there always is about their approach to the dead  tree-top from which they procure their twigs for nest-building. Often  did I see birds hesitate above the opening and then pass on,  apparently as though they had not struck it at just the right angle.  On one occasion a solitary bird was left flying, and it took three or  four trials either to make up its mind or to catch the trick of the  descent. On dark or threatening or stormy days the birds would begin  to assemble by mid-afternoon, and by four or five o'clock were all in  their lodgings.    The chimney is a capacious one, forty or fifty feet high and nearly  three feet square, yet it did not seem adequate to afford  breathing-space for so many birds. I was curious to know how they  disposed themselves inside. At the bottom was a small opening. Holding  my ear to it, I could hear a continuous chippering and humming, as if  the birds were still all in motion, like an agitated beehive. At nine  o'clock this multitudinous sound of wings and voices was still going  on, and doubtless it was kept up all night. What was the meaning of  it? Was the press of birds so great that they needed to keep their  wings moving to ventilate the shaft, as do certain of the bees in a  crowded hive? Or were these restless spirits unable to fold their  wings even in sleep? I was very curious to get a peep inside that  chimney when the swifts were in it. So one afternoon this opportunity  was afforded me by the removal of the large smoke-pipe of the old  steam-boiler. This left an opening into which I could thrust my head  and shoulders. The sound of wings and voices filled the hollow shaft.  On looking up, I saw the sides of the chimney for about half its  length paved with the restless birds; they sat so close together that  their bodies touched. Moreover, a large number of them were  constantly on the wing, showing against the sky light as if they were  leaving the chimney. But they did not leave it. They rose up a few  feet and then resumed their positions upon the sides, and it was this  movement that caused the humming sound. All the while the droppings of  the birds came down like a summer shower. At the bottom of the shaft  was a mine of guano three or four feet deep, with a dead swift here  and there upon it. Probably one or more birds out of such a multitude  died every night. I had fancied there would be many more. It was a  long time before it dawned upon me what this uninterrupted flight  within the chimney meant. Finally I saw that it was a sanitary  measure: only thus could the birds keep from soiling each other with  their droppings. Birds digest very rapidly, and had they all continued  to cling to the sides of the wall, they would have been in a sad  predicament before morning. Like other acts of cleanliness on the part  of birds, this was doubtless the prompting of instinct and not of  judgment. It was Nature looking out for her own.    In view, then, of the doubtful sense or intelligence of the wild  creatures, what shall we say of the new school of nature writers or  natural history romancers that has lately arisen, and that reads into  the birds and animals almost the entire human psychology? This,  surely: so far as these writers awaken an interest in the wild  denizens of the field and wood, and foster a genuine love of them in  the hearts of the young people, so far is their influence good; but so  far as they pervert natural history and give false impressions of the  intelligence of our animals, catering to a taste that prefers the  fanciful to the true and the real, is their influence bad. Of course  the great army of readers prefer this sugar-coated natural history to  the real thing, but the danger always is that an indulgence of this  taste will take away a liking for the real thing, or prevent its  development. The knowing ones, those who can take these pretty tales  with the pinch of salt of real knowledge, are not many; the great  majority are simply entertained while they are being humbugged. There  may be no very serious objection to the popular love of sweets being  catered to in this field by serving up the life-history of our animals  in a story, all the missing links supplied, and all their motives and  acts humanized, provided it is not done covertly and under the guise  of a real history. We are never at a loss how to take Kipling in his  \"Jungle Book;\" we are pretty sure that this is fact dressed up as  fiction, and that much of the real life of the jungle is in these  stories. I remember reading his story of \"The White Seal\" shortly  after I had visited the Seal Islands in Bering Sea, and I could not  detect in the story one departure from the facts of the life-history  of the seal, so far as it is known. Kipling takes no covert liberties  with natural history, any more than he does with the facts of human  history in his novels.    Unadulterated, unsweetened observations are what the real nature-lover  craves. No man can invent incidents and traits as interesting as the  reality. Then, to know that a thing is true gives it such a savor! The  truth--how we do crave the truth! We cannot feed our minds on  simulacra any more than we can our bodies. Do assure us that the thing  you tell is true. If you must counterfeit the truth, do it so deftly  that we shall never detect you. But in natural history there is no  need to counterfeit the truth; the reality always suffices, if you  have eyes to see it and ears to hear it. Behold what Maeterlinck makes  out of the life of the bee, simply by getting at and portraying the  facts--a true wonder-book, the enchantment of poetry wedded to the  authority of science.    Works on animal intelligence, such as Romanes's, abound in incidents  that show in the animals reason and forethought in their simpler  forms; but in many cases the incidents related in these works are not  well authenticated, nor told by trained observers. The observations of  the great majority of people have no scientific value whatever.  Romanes quotes from some person who alleges that he saw a pair of  nightingales, during a flood in the river near which their nest was  placed, pick up the nest bodily and carry it to a place of safety.  This is incredible. If Romanes himself or Darwin himself said he saw  this, one would have to believe it. Birds whose nests have been  plundered sometimes pull the old nest to pieces and use the material,  or parts of it, in building a new nest; but I cannot believe that any  pair of birds ever picked up a nest containing eggs and carried it off  to a new place. How could they do it? With one on each side, how could  they fly with the nest between them? They could not carry it with  their feet, and how could they manage it with their beaks?    My neighbor met in the woods a black snake that had just swallowed a  red squirrel. Now your romance-naturalist may take such a fact as this  and make as pretty a story of it as he can. He may ascribe to the  snake and his victim all the human emotions he pleases. He may make  the snake glide through the tree-tops from limb to limb, and from tree  to tree, in pursuit of its prey: the main thing is, the snake got the  squirrel. If our romancer makes the snake fascinate the squirrel, I  shall object, because I don't believe that snakes have this power.  People like to believe that they have. It would seem as if this  subtle, gliding, hateful creature ought to have some such mysterious  gift, but I have no proof that it has. Every year I see the black  snake robbing birds'-nests, or pursued by birds whose nests it has  just plundered, but I have yet to see it cast its fatal spell upon a  grown bird. Or, if our romancer says that the black snake was drilled  in the art of squirrel-catching by its mother, I shall know he is a  pretender.    Speaking of snakes reminds me of an incident I have several times  witnessed in our woods in connection with a snake commonly called the  sissing or blowing adder. When I have teased this snake a few moments  with my cane, it seems to be seized with an epileptic or cataleptic  fit. It throws itself upon its back, coiled nearly in the form of a  figure eight, and begins a series of writhings and twistings and  convulsive movements astonishing to behold. Its mouth is open and  presently full of leaf-mould, its eyes are covered with the same, its  head is thrown back, its white belly up; now it is under the leaves,  now out, the body all the while being rapidly drawn through this  figure eight, so that the head"]]]
