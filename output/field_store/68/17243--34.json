One reply is obvious. The sight  of climbers struggling upwards to the supreme pinnacle will have taught  men to lift their eyes unto the hills--to raise them off the ground and  direct them, if only for a moment, to something pure and lofty and  satisfying to that inner craving for the worthiest which all men have  hidden in their souls. And when they see men thrown back at first but  venturing again and again to the assault till with faltering footsteps  and gasping breaths they at last reach the summit they will thrill with  pride. They will no longer be obsessed with the thought of what mites  they are in comparison with the mountains--how insignificant they are  beside their material surroundings. They will have a proper pride in  themselves and a well-grounded faith in the capacity of spirit to  dominate material.    And direct practical results flow from this increasing confidence which  man is acquiring in face of the mountains. A century ago Napoleon's  crossing of the Alps was thought an astounding feat. During the last  thirty years troops--and Indian troops--have been moved about the  Himalaya in all seasons and crossed passes over 15,000 feet above sea  level in the depth of winter. On the Gilgit frontier, in Chitral, and in  Tibet, neither cold nor snow nor wind stopped them. In winter or in  summer, in spring or in autumn, they have faced the Himalayan passes.  And they have been able to negotiate them successfully because of their  increased knowledge of men's capacities and of the way to overcome  difficulties that constant wrestling with mountains in all parts of the  world during the last half-century has given. The activities of the  Alpine Club have produced direct practical results in the movement of  troops in the Himalaya.    More still will follow. When men have proved that they can surmount the  highest peak in the Himalaya they will take heart to climb other peaks  and become more and more at home in that wonderful region, extending for  nigh two thousand miles from the Roof of the World in the North and West  to the borders of Burma and China in the South and East and containing  more than seventy peaks over 24,000 feet in height--that is higher than  any in the Andes, the second highest range of mountains in the  world--and more than eleven hundred peaks over 20,000 feet in height.  This great mountain region which in Europe would stretch from Calais to  the Caspian is one vast mine of beauty of every varied description. And  a mine of beauty has this advantage over a mine of material wealth--that  we can never exhaust it. And not only can we never exhaust it, but the  more we take out the more we find, and the more we give away the richer  we are. We may go on digging into a gold mine, but eventually we shall  find there is no gold left. We shall have exhausted our mine. But we may  dig into that mine of beauty in the Himalaya and never exhaust it. The  more we dig the more we shall find--richer beauty, subtler beauty, more  varied beauty--beauty of mountain form and beauty of pure and delicate  colour, beauty of forest, beauty of river and beauty of lake and  combined beauty of rushing torrent, precipitous cliff, richest  vegetation and overtopping snowy summit. And when we have discovered  these treasures and made them our own we can actually increase their  value to ourselves by giving them away to others. By imparting to others  the enjoyment which we have felt we shall have increased our own  enjoyment.    We cannot expect those who are first engaged in climbing Mount Everest  to have the time or inclination to observe and describe the full beauty  there is. They will be set on overcoming the physical difficulties and  they will be so exhausted for the moment by the effort they will have  made that they will not have the repose of mind which is so necessary  for seeing and depicting beauty. But when they have pioneered the way  and beaten down a path, others will more leisurely follow after. Many  even of these may not be able to express in words or in picture the  enjoyment they have felt and be able to communicate it to others. They  may not be given to public speech or writing and may have no capacity  for painting. The flame of their enjoyment may be kept sacred and hidden  within them, and it may be only in the privacy of colloquy with some  kindred soul that the white glow of their enjoyment may ever be shown.  But, others there may be who have the capacity for making the world at  large share with them some little of the joy they have felt--who can  make our nerves tingle and our blood course quicker, our eyes uplift  themselves and our outlook widen as we go out with them to face and  overcome the mountains. Such men as these from their very intimacy with  the mountains are able to point out beauties which distant beholders  would never suspect. And as Leslie Stephen through his love of mountains  has been able to attract thousands to the Alps and given them enjoyment,  clean and fresh, which but for him they might never have known, so we  hope that in the fulness of time a greater Stephen will tell of the  unsurpassable beauty of the Himalaya and by so doing add appreciably to  the enjoyment of human life.                         *       *       *       *       *    Such are some of the advantages which men in general will obtain from  the attempt to climb Mount Everest. But it is time now to say something  of the mountain itself.    Mount Everest for its size is a singularly shy and retiring mountain. It  hides itself away behind other mountains. On the north side, in Tibet,  it does indeed stand up proudly and alone, a true monarch among  mountains. But it stands in a very sparsely inhabited part of Tibet, and  very few people ever go to Tibet. From the Indian side only its tip  appears among a mighty array of peaks which being nearer look higher.  Consequently for a long time no one suspected Mount Everest of being the  supreme mountain not only of the Himalaya but of the world. At the time  when Hooker was making his Himalayan journeys--that was in  1849--Kanchenjunga was believed to be the highest.    How it was eventually discovered to be the highest is a story worth  recording. In the very year that Hooker was botanising in the Sikkim  Himalaya the officers of the Great Trigonometrical Survey were making  observations from the plains of India to the peaks in Nepal which could  be seen from there. When they could find a native name for a peak they  called it by that name. But in most cases no native name was  forthcoming, and in those cases a Roman number was affixed to the peak.  Among these unnamed peaks to which observations to determine the  altitude and position were taken from stations in the plains was Peak  XV. The observations were recorded, but the resulting height was not  computed till three years later, and then one day the Bengali Chief  Computer rushed into the room of the Surveyor-General, Sir Andrew Waugh,  breathlessly exclaiming, \"Sir! I have discovered the highest mountain in  the world.\" The mean result of all the observations taken from the six  stations from which Peak XV had been observed came to 29,002 feet, and  this Peak XV is what is now known as Mount Everest.    The question is often asked, \"Why twenty-nine thousand and two?\" \"Why be  so particular about the two?\" The answer is that that particular figure  is the mean of many observations. But it is not infallible. It is indeed  in all probability below rather than above the mark, and a later  computation of the observed results puts the height at 29,141 feet. In  any case, however, there are, as Sir Sidney Burrard has pointed out in  his discussion of this point in Burrard and Hayden's _Himalaya and  Tibet_, many causes of slight error in observing and computing the  altitude of a distant and very lofty peak. The observations are made  with a theodolite. The telescope of the theodolite may not be absolutely  perfect. The theodolite may not be levelled with perfect accuracy. The  graduations on the circle of the theodolite may not be quite accurate.  The observer himself may not have observed with sufficient perfection.  An error of ten feet may have resulted from these causes. Then there are  other and greater sources of possible error. There may be error in the  assumed height of the observing station; and the altitudes of peaks are  always varying in nature with the increase and decrease of snow in  summer and winter and in a season of heavy snowfall or a season of light  snowfall. Another source of error arises from the varying effects of  gravitational attraction. \"The attraction of the great mass of the  Himalaya and Tibet,\" says Burrard, \"pulls all liquids towards itself, as  the moon attracts the ocean and the surface of the water assumes an  irregular form at the foot of the Himalaya. If the ocean were to  overflow Northern India its surface would be deformed by Himalayan  attraction. The liquid in levels is similarly affected and theodolites  cannot consequently be adjusted; their plates when levelled are still  tilted upward towards the mountains, and angles of observation are too  small by the amount the horizon is inclined to the tangential plane. At  Darjeeling the surface of water in repose is inclined about 35'' to  this plane, at Kurseong about 51'', at Siliguri about 23'', at Dehra  Dun and Mussooree about 37''.
