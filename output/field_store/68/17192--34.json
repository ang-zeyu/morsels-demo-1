These floes become welded  together and form the \"ice-foot\" frequently referred to in these pages,  and photographs showing how this is done are seen on Figs. 5, 6, 7 and  8.    At the back of the rookery, nesting sites are to be seen stretching up  the steep cliff to a height of over 1000 feet, some of them being almost  inaccessible, so difficult is the climb which the penguins have made to  reach them.      [Illustration: Fig. 6. \"... Throw up Masses of Ice,]      [Illustration: Fig. 7. \"... Which are Frozen into a Compact Mass as    Winter approaches\" (Page 10)]    On Duke of York Island, some twenty miles south of the Cape Adare  rookery, another breeding-place has been made. This is a small colony  only, as might be expected. Indeed it is difficult to see why the  penguins chose this place at all whilst room still exists at the bigger  rookery, because Duke of York Island, until late in the season, is cut  off from open water by many miles of sea-ice, so that with the exception  of an occasional tide crack, or seals' blow holes, the birds of that  rookery have no means of getting food except by making a long journey on  foot. When the arrivals were streaming up to Cape Adare many were seen  to pass by, making in a straight line for Duke of York Island, and so  adding another twenty miles on foot to the journey they had already  accomplished.    When the time arrived for the birds to feed, some open leads had formed  about half way across the bay, and those of the Duke of York colony were  to be seen streaming over the ice for many miles on their way between  the water and their nests. They seem to think nothing of long journeys,  however, as in the early season, when unbroken sea-ice intervened  between the two rookeries, parties of penguins from Cape Adare actually  used to march out and meet their Duke of York friends half way over,  presumably for the pleasure of a chat.    To realize what this meant, we must remember that an Adelie penguin's  eyes being only about twelve inches above the ground when on the march,  his horizon is only one mile distant. Thus from Cape Adare he could just  see the top of the mountain on Duke of York Island peeping above the  horizon _on the clearest day_. In anything like thick weather he could  not see it at all, and probably he had never been there. So in the first  place, what was it that impelled him to go on this long journey to meet  his friends, and when so impelled, what instinct pointed out the way?  This of course merely brings us to the old question of migratory  instinct, but in the case of the penguin, its horizon is so very short  that it is quite evident he possesses a special sense of direction, in  addition to the special sense which urged him to go and meet the Duke of  York Island contingent, and I may here remark that when we were  returning to New Zealand in the summer of 1913, we passed troops of  penguins swimming in the open sea far out of sight of land,--an  unanswerable reply to those naturalists who still maintain that  migrating birds must rely upon their eyes for guidance, and this remark  applies equally to the penguins we found on the northern limits of the  pack-ice, some five hundred miles from the rookeries to which they would  repair the following year.

According to Pennell, it appears probable that there is a great hang of    pack in the sea west of Cape Adare and south of the Balleny Islands, and    most likely it is here that the Adelies repair when they leave Cape    Adare rookery in the autumn. I think, however, it is safe to assume that    they seek the northernmost limits of the pack during the winter, as    these would offer the most favourable conditions.

And later, form the Beautiful Terraces of    the Ice-foot\"]      [Illustration: Fig. 9. Penguins at the Rookery (Page 18)]    The exact whereabouts of the Adelie penguins during the winter months  has been much discussed by different writers. It is agreed that they  repair to the pack-ice, but our knowledge of the movements of this pack  is very vague at the present time, and so unfortunately I can give but a  rough idea of the subject.    I have collected and noted down the latest evidence for the benefit of  the zoologists of future expeditions who may wish to investigate the  matter further, and I am indebted for nearly the whole of it to  Commander Harry L. Pennell, R.N., commander of the _Terra Nova_ from  1910 to 1913, who kindly drew up for me Tables A and B (_see_ pp. 13 and  14).    Probably the information which more nearly concerns the penguins of Cape  Adare rookery will be found in Table A. The birds from Cape Crozier and  Cape Royds rookeries must have some four hundred miles further to travel  when they go North in the autumn than those at Cape Adare.          PART I      THE FASTING PERIOD    Diary from October 13 to November 3, describing the arrival of the  Adelie penguins at the rookery, and habits during the periods of mating  and building.    The first Adelie penguins arrived at the Ridley Beach rookery, Cape  Adare, on October 13. A blizzard came on then, with thick drift which  prevented any observations being made. The next day, when this subsided,  there were no penguins to be seen.    On October 15 two of them were loitering about the beach. During the  forenoon they were separate, but in the afternoon they kept company, and  walked over to the south-east corner of the rookery under the cliff of  Cape Adare, where they were sheltered from the cold breeze.    On October 16 at 11 A.M. there were about twenty penguins arrived.  Several came singly, and one little party of three came up together. On  arrival they wandered about by themselves, and stood or walked about the  beach, giving one the impression of simply hanging about, waiting for  something to \"turn up.\"    By 4 P.M. there must have been close on a hundred penguins at the  rookery. It was a calm day and misty, so that I could not see far out  across the sea-ice, but so far it was evident that the birds were not  arriving in batches, but just dribbling in. They were then for the most  part squatting about the rookery, well scattered, some solitary, others  in groups, and facing in all directions. (Fig. 9.) They were not on the  prominences where the nesting sites are, but in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#3)"],[1," or commission, is a curious and very  interesting document. He is ordered to prepare an authoritative chart,  called a \"Padron General\", on which all discoveries are to be shown,  and whence the charts for all ships are to be copied; and he is also  to examine all pilots in the use of the astrolabe and quadrant, and  to give instruction in his house at Seville. Vespucci was able to give  theoretical instruction in cosmography; although a man who first went  to sea when he was nearly fifty, and who had only made three voyages,  could not be an experienced pilot. With such experts as Juan de la Cosa,  Juan Diaz de Solis, Vicente Pinzon, and others, available, it was indeed  a strange selection. But Ferdinand and Fonseca were notorious for their  bad appointments. Columbus was sent home in chains, Blasco Nunez de Balboa  was beheaded; while high places, for which they were more or less unfit,  were entrusted to Ovando, Bobadilla, Pedrarias, and Vespucci.    Vespucci held the appointment of Chief Pilot until the 22nd of February  1512, when he died at Seville, aged 61. He had married a Spaniard  named Maria Cerezo, but left no children. His widow received a pension  of 10,000 maravedis,[27] to be paid out of the salary of her husband's  successor,[28] Juan Diaz de Solis. Vespucci left his papers to his nephew  Giovanni, son of his brother Antonio, who received the appointment of a  royal pilot, with a salary of 20,000 maravedis, on May 22nd, 1512.[29]  He went as chief pilot in the expedition of Pedrarias Davila in 1514;  and is mentioned as a royal pilot in 1515 and 1516. In 1524 he was a  member of the Badajoz Commission, but was dismissed in March 1525.    This is all that is known of the life of Amerigo Vespucci, beyond what  is contained in his own letters, which we will now proceed to consider  in detail.    Of the two letters of Vespucci that have been preserved, the earliest  was written from Lisbon in March or April 1503, and was addressed to  Lorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici. The original Italian text is lost, but  it was translated into Latin by \"Jocundus Interpreter\", who is supposed  to have been the same Giuliano di Bartolomeo di Giocondo who brought  the invitation to Vespucci to come to Portugal in 1501.[30] The letter  describes the voyage of discovery sent from Lisbon in May 1501, in which  Vespucci alleged that he took part. He alludes to a previous letter  in which he had fully described \"the new countries\", and continues:  \"it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries  were known to our ancestors, and to all who hear about them they will  be entirely new.\" He does not mention the name of the commander of the  expedition, and assumes all the glory of the discovery for himself. \"_I_  have found a continent in that southern part more populous and more  full of animals than our Europe or Asia or Africa.\"[31] Moreover, the  safety of the ships, their navigation across the ocean, their escape  from perils, were all due to this wonderful beef contractor, if we are  to believe his own account. \"If my companions had not trusted in me,  to whom cosmography was known, no one, not the leader of our navigation,  would have known where we were after running five hundred leagues.\" He  goes on to tell us that his \"knowledge of the marine chart, and the rules  taught by it, were more worth than all the pilots in the world\".[32]  After relating some fictitious stories about the natives and their  cannibalism, and giving a glowing but vague account of the vegetation,  he concludes with some absurd remarks about the stars of the southern  hemisphere, which he has the assurance to tell us were measured by him  to see which was the largest. The letter concludes with the statement  that this was his third voyage, as he had made two by order of the King  of Spain. This is the first intimation of a design to make two voyages  out of the Hojeda expedition, one of which was to precede the Admiral's  discovery of the mainland. He also announces his intention of collecting  all the wonderful things he had seen into a cosmographical book, that  his record may live with future generations, intending to complete it,  with the aid of friends, at home. The letter shows the character of the  man, and how little reliance can be placed on his statements.    The letter to Medici was printed very soon after it was written. The  first issue, entitled _Mundus Novus_, consisting of four 4to leaves,  and the second, _Epistola Albericij de Novo Mundo_, are without place  or date. A copy of the third, printed at Augsburg in 1504, and entitled  _Mundus Novus_, is in the Grenville Library. Then followed two others,  and the sixth issue was the early Paris edition of Jean Lambert, a copy  of which is in the Bibliotheque Nationale. Another Paris edition, nearly  as old, is in the Grenville Library. In 1505, an issue, entitled _De Ora  Antarctica_, and edited by Ringmann, appeared at Strasbourg. The letter  was also included in the book of voyages, _Paesi novamente retrovati_,  printed at Vicenza in 1507, where it was called _Novo Mondo da Alb.  Vesputio_. It was thus widely circulated over Europe, and Vespucci  obtained the credit of discoveries made by the unnamed Portuguese  commander. The title, _Novus Mundus_, is taken from the opening boast  of his letter, that it is lawful to call the discovery _a new world_  because no one had ever seen it before. It was thus that Vespucci got  his name connected, throughout Europe, with the discovery of a New World,  and this prepared the way for the proposal to give it the name of America!    The more important letter of Vespucci, containing the account of  his alleged four voyages, was written in September 1504, a short  time before he left Portugal. A copy, in French, was sent to Rene  II, Duke of Lorraine, while the Italian original was addressed to a  \"Magnificent Lord\", who is supposed, with much probability, to have  been Piero Soderini, the Gonfaloniere of Florence from 1502 to 1512.  Vespucci speaks of him as having been his schoolfellow, and as being, at  the time the letter was written, in a high official position at Florence.    The French copy was translated into Latin, and published at St. Die in  April 1507, in the _Cosmographiae Introductio_, a rare little book by the  Professor of Cosmography at the University of St. Die in Lorraine, named  Martin Waldzeemueller, who used the _nom de plume_ of Hylacomylus. The  Italian version was also printed at an early date, a little volume in  quarto of thirty-two pages, without place or year. It is excessively rare,  only four copies being known to exist. One belonged to Baccio Valori,  and from it Bandini published a new edition in 1745. It was afterwards  the property of the Marchese Gino Capponi. The second belonged to Gaetano  Poggiale of Leghorn, and is now in the Palatine Library at Florence. The  third is in the Grenville Library. The fourth belonged to the Carthusian  Monastery at Seville, and was bought by Varnhagen in 1863 at Havanna.[33]    The Medici letter, and both the Latin and Italian versions of the Soderini  letter, are given by Varnhagen in his work on Vespucci.    There are forty-four words or expressions of Spanish or Portuguese origin  in the Italian version,[34] which Vespucci must have got into the habit  of using during his long residence in Spain, even when writing in his  own language. Twelve of these refer to things belonging to the sea or  ships,[35] an indication that Vespucci was ignorant of maritime affairs  before he went to sea with Hojeda in 1499. But the Hispanicisms also show  that the letter to Soderini was written by an Italian who had lived for  several years among Spaniards. Vespucci answers to this description. He  had been ten years in Spain or Portugal, or in Spanish or Portuguese  ships, when he composed the letter to Soderini.    The feature in Vespucci's letters that has struck nearly all the students  who have examined them, is their extraordinary vagueness. Not a single  name of a commander is mentioned, and in the account of the two Spanish  voyages there are not half-a-dozen names of places. The admirers of  Vespucci explain this away by pointing out that he was corresponding  with a friend, and only wrote what was likely to amuse him; and that he  refers to a book he had written for fuller details. This might explain  many omissions, but it is scarcely sufficient to account for the absolute  silence respecting commanders and comrades, whom it would be as natural  to mention as dates or the number of ships, and quite as entertaining.  This extraordinary silence can really be accounted for only by the  assumption that no real names could be made to fit into the facts as he  gave them. This is, no doubt, the true explanation.    The \"book\" is referred to in four places in the Soderini letter, and  once in the Medici letter. In one place Vespucci says: \"In these four  voyages I have seen so many things different from our customs that I have  written a book to be called _The Four Voyages_, in which I have related  the greater part of the things that I saw, very clearly and to the best  of my ability. I have not yet published it, because my own affairs are in  such a bad state that I have no taste for what I have written, yet I am  inclined to publish it. In this work will be seen every event in detail,  so I do not enlarge upon them here.\"[36] A little further on he says:  \"In each of my voyages I have noted down the most remarkable things,  and all is reduced to a volume, in the geographical style, entitled _The  Four Voyages_, in which all things are described in detail; but I have  not yet sent out a copy, because it is necessary for me to revise it.\"[37]  According to these two statements the book had been actually written, but  not yet revised or shown to anyone. He also speaks of his observations  of fixed stars as being in his _Four Voyages_.[38] But towards the"]]]
