The year 1827 found him a hardened,  hopeless old man of sixty, battered in health and ruined in pocket; but  who, by dint of stays, hair-dye, and courage, yet faced the world with  undaunted front, and dined as gaily in bailiff-haunted Belsize as he had  dined at Carlton House. Of the possessions of the House of Wotton Wade,  this old manor, timberless and bare, was all that remained, and its  master rarely visited it.    On the evening of May 3, 1827, Lord Bellasis had been attending a pigeon  match at Hornsey Wood, and having resisted the importunities of his  companion, Mr. Lionel Crofton (a young gentleman-rake, whose position  in the sporting world was not the most secure), who wanted him to go on  into town, he had avowed his intention of striking across Hampstead to  Belsize. \"I have an appointment at the fir trees on the Heath,\" he said.    \"With a woman?\" asked Mr. Crofton.    \"Not at all; with a parson.\"    \"A parson!\"    \"You stare! Well, he is only just ordained. I met him last year at Bath  on his vacation from Cambridge, and he was good enough to lose some  money to me.\"    \"And now waits to pay it out of his first curacy. I wish your lordship  joy with all my soul. Then, we must push on, for it grows late.\"    \"Thanks, my dear sir, for the 'we,' but I must go alone,\" said Lord  Bellasis dryly. \"To-morrow you can settle with me for the sitting of  last week. Hark! the clock is striking nine. Good night.\"                *          *          *          *          *      At half-past nine Richard Devine quitted his mother's house to begin the  new life he had chosen, and so, drawn together by that strange fate of  circumstances which creates events, the father and son approached each  other.                *          *          *          *          *      As the young man gained the middle of the path which led to the Heath,  he met Sir Richard returning from the village. It was no part of his  plan to seek an interview with the man whom his mother had so deeply  wronged, and he would have slunk past in the gloom; but seeing him thus  alone returning to a desolated home, the prodigal was tempted to utter  some words of farewell and of regret. To his astonishment, however, Sir  Richard passed swiftly on, with body bent forward as one in the act of  falling, and with eyes unconscious of surroundings, staring straight  into the distance. Half-terrified at this strange appearance, Richard  hurried onward, and at a turn of the path stumbled upon something which  horribly accounted for the curious action of the old man. A dead body  lay upon its face in the heather; beside it was a heavy riding whip  stained at the handle with blood, and an open pocket-book. Richard took  up the book, and read, in gold letters on the cover, \"Lord Bellasis.\"    The unhappy young man knelt down beside the body and raised it.  The skull had been fractured by a blow, but it seemed that life yet  lingered. Overcome with horror--for he could not doubt but that his  mother's worst fears had been realized--Richard knelt there holding his  murdered father in his arms, waiting until the murderer, whose name he  bore, should have placed himself beyond pursuit. It seemed an hour to  his excited fancy before he saw a light pass along the front of the  house he had quitted, and knew that Sir Richard had safely reached his  chamber. With some bewildered intention of summoning aid, he left the  body and made towards the town. As he stepped out on the path he heard  voices, and presently some dozen men, one of whom held a horse, burst  out upon him, and, with sudden fury, seized and flung him to the ground.    At first the young man, so rudely assailed, did not comprehend his own  danger. His mind, bent upon one hideous explanation of the crime, did  not see another obvious one which had already occurred to the mind of  the landlord of the Three Spaniards.    \"God defend me!\" cried Mr. Mogford, scanning by the pale light of  the rising moon the features of the murdered man, \"but it is Lord  Bellasis!--oh, you bloody villain! Jem, bring him along here, p'r'aps  his lordship can recognize him!\"    \"It was not I!\" cried Richard Devine. \"For God's sake, my lord say--\"  then he stopped abruptly, and being forced on his knees by his captors,  remained staring at the dying man, in sudden and ghastly fear.    Those men in whom emotion has the effect of quickening circulation  of the blood reason rapidly in moments of danger, and in the terrible  instant when his eyes met those of Lord Bellasis, Richard Devine had  summed up the chances of his future fortune, and realized to the full  his personal peril. The runaway horse had given the alarm. The  drinkers at the Spaniards' Inn had started to search the Heath, and had  discovered a fellow in rough costume, whose person was unknown to  them, hastily quitting a spot where, beside a rifled pocket-book and a  blood-stained whip, lay a dying man.      The web of circumstantial evidence had enmeshed him. An hour ago escape  would have been easy. He would have had but to cry, \"I am the son of Sir  Richard Devine. Come with me to yonder house, and I will prove to  you that I have but just quitted it,\"--to place his innocence beyond  immediate question. That course of action was impossible now. Knowing  Sir Richard as he did, and believing, moreover, that in his raging  passion the old man had himself met and murdered the destroyer of  his honour, the son of Lord Bellasis and Lady Devine saw himself in  a position which would compel him either to sacrifice himself, or to  purchase a chance of safety at the price of his mother's dishonour and  the death of the man whom his mother had deceived. If the outcast son  were brought a prisoner to North End House, Sir Richard--now doubly  oppressed of fate--would be certain to deny him; and he would be  compelled, in self-defence, to reveal a story which would at once bring  his mother to open infamy, and send to the gallows the man who had been  for twenty years deceived--the man to whose kindness he owed education  and former fortune. He knelt, stupefied, unable to speak or move.    \"Come,\" cried Mogford again; \"say, my lord, is this the villain?\"    Lord Bellasis rallied his failing senses, his glazing eyes stared into  his son's face with horrible eagerness; he shook his head, raised a  feeble arm as though to point elsewhere, and fell back dead.    \"If you didn't murder him, you robbed him,\" growled Mogford, \"and you  shall sleep at Bow Street to-night. Tom, run on to meet the patrol, and  leave word at the Gate-house that I've a passenger for the coach!--Bring  him on, Jack!--What's your name, eh?\"    He repeated the rough question twice before his prisoner answered, but  at length Richard Devine raised a pale face which stern resolution had  already hardened into defiant manhood, and said \"Dawes--Rufus Dawes.\"                *          *          *          *          *      His new life had begun already: for that night one, Rufus Dawes, charged  with murder and robbery, lay awake in prison, waiting for the fortune of  the morrow.    Two other men waited as eagerly. One, Mr. Lionel Crofton; the other, the  horseman who had appointment with the murdered Lord Bellasis under the  shadow of the fir trees on Hampstead Heath. As for Sir Richard Devine,  he waited for no one, for upon reaching his room he had fallen senseless  in a fit of apoplexy.            BOOK I.--THE SEA. 1827.          CHAPTER I. THE PRISON SHIP.        In the breathless stillness of a tropical afternoon, when the air was  hot and heavy, and the sky brazen and cloudless, the shadow of the  Malabar lay solitary on the surface of the glittering sea.    The sun--who rose on the left hand every morning a blazing ball, to move  slowly through the unbearable blue, until he sank fiery red in mingling  glories of sky and ocean on the right hand--had just got low enough to  peep beneath the awning that covered the poop-deck, and awaken a young  man, in an undress military uniform, who was dozing on a coil of rope.    \"Hang it!\" said he, rising and stretching himself, with the weary sigh  of a man who has nothing to do, \"I must have been asleep\"; and then,  holding by a stay, he turned about and looked down into the waist of the  ship.    Save for the man at the wheel and the guard at the quarter-railing,  he was alone on the deck. A few birds flew round about the vessel, and  seemed to pass under her stern windows only to appear again at her bows.  A lazy albatross, with the white water flashing from his wings, rose  with a dabbling sound to leeward, and in the place where he had been  glided the hideous fin of a silently-swimming shark. The seams of the  well-scrubbed deck were sticky with melted pitch, and the brass plate of  the compass-case sparkled in the sun like a jewel. There was no breeze,  and as the clumsy ship rolled and lurched on the heaving sea, her idle  sails flapped against her masts with a regularly recurring noise, and  her bowsprit would seem to rise higher with the water's swell, to  dip again with a jerk that made each rope tremble and tauten. On the  forecastle, some half-dozen soldiers, in all varieties of undress, were  playing at cards, smoking, or watching the fishing-lines hanging over  the catheads.    So far the appearance of the vessel differed in no wise from that of an  ordinary transport. But in the waist a curious sight presented itself.  It was as though one had built a cattle-pen there. At the foot of the  foremast, and at the quarter-deck, a strong barricade, loop-holed and  furnished with doors for ingress and egress, ran across the deck from  bulwark to bulwark. Outside this cattle-pen an armed sentry stood on  guard; inside, standing, sitting, or walking monotonously, within range  of the shining barrels in the arm chest on the poop, were some sixty men  and boys, dressed in uniform grey."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#3)"],[1,"night. If holed in the  creek bank, the chances are that the animal will dart out into the  water and escape to another den.    The most successful mink hunting is done during the day by having  your dog along and following the banks of creeks, lakes, ponds, etc.  The dog locates the game and the animal is gotten out by methods  already described.      [Illustration: Descendants From Jamestown Imported Hounds.]        CHAPTER II.    THE NIGHT HUNTING DOG--HIS ANCESTRY.    Dogs of almost any breed, from the nondescript mongrel to the bred  and developed hound may be taught to hunt in the woods at night.  However, their success is, in a general way, in proportion to their  adaptability for the work and the plentifulness of game. For  instance, take a country raised dog of hound parentage, and he is as  apt to make as good a night dog as a pedigreed, handsome hound which  has grown up in the city, without opportunity to verify by experience  his instinctive notion of things. Everything else being equal, the  well bred hound should prove by far the better raw material for a  good night hunter.    The ideal coon dogs of most experienced night hunters are the half  bred fox hounds. Thus is enlisted the training of centuries to match  the wits of the 'coon which was born wily, and develops stratagem  from experience and necessity, affording as exciting and pretty a  contest (dog vs. coon) as sport provides.    The more one knows of the hound he follows, the greater will be his  enjoyment and success. He will avoid blaming the dog with his own  mistakes, and wisely refrain from trying to exact from the dog what  by physique and breeding he was not intended by nature to do.    How the modern fox hound descended from the blood hound and the coon  hound from the fox hound is an interesting study of more or less  importance in striking an estimate of the coon dog's prowess and  abilities. It is not such a far cry from the exciting man hunt of  other days to the coon hunt of the present.    What we call the native American fox-hounds are descended from dogs  brought over from England, Ireland and France. The settlers at  Jamestown imported the hounds that spread out over the southern  frontier, originating the superb packs to be found throughout the  South to-day.    The imported dog has never proven a good performer in the chase,  owing to very widely different conditions encountered. His value has  been in cross breeding to give bone and substance to native breeds.    Says one authority: By selection and a different character of work,  we have produced a lighter, faster hound than the ancestral type. Our  hounds are required to go and search for a fox. That quality has  become instinctive in them and it is an extremely necessary natural  quality.    What we have really done in this country with the fox-hound is, we  have created a new type. Our native hounds which are without any near  English or Irish hound crosses are not only faster than their  ancestors, but they get about in rough country, quicker and with  greater ease. The American bred dog, long accustomed to hunting, may  be readily developed to night hunting.    There are some strains of native hounds that train easier than  others. Hounds that have come down through an ancestry which have  long been in large packs have certain fixed notions or instincts  about hunting that are more difficult to change than are hounds which  have grown up singly or in couples.    Whatever manner of hound the trainer may undertake to develop it is  well for him to consider the dog's ancestry and the way in which they  have been hunted. He will find if his hound is well bred that the  ancestral influence will tend to assert itself. Knowing what is in  his hound, the trainer will know better how to handle him to bring  him up to the highest possible degree of efficiency.    There were many different breeds of the hound family existing in  England, when the fox hound, the great grandfather of the typical  night hunter under consideration, began to assume a fixed type and  receive recognition.    \"A popular error\" writes another authority, \"into which many writers  have fallen is to associate the fox hound with any one or two breeds  of hounds for his common ancestry, for the fact is that both the  English and American fox hound is a composite animal, descended from  many different varieties of hounds which have existed in the past.\"    There are a number of breeds of hounds in France to-day that cannot  be intelligently traced to any peculiar origin and there have been a  greater variety of hounds in the past, which have found the way into  the kingdom by different roads.    It will never be known exactly what hunting qualities the hounds of  our crude forefathers possessed or with what melody of tongue,  accuracy of scent, or fleetness of foot they pursued game, which  consisted, with now and then an exception, of the stag, wild boar and  wolf, until the gradual advance of civilization drove the larger  animals from denuded forest and left the cunning fox as the logical  object of especial attention to huntsmen, who have spared neither  time nor expense to accomplish his death legitimately for nearly two  centuries.    Summing up we are impressed with the fact that the perfect fox or  coon hound is a superb physical being of most versatile and capable  properties, subject to our beck and call, if we learn the language of  the chase, before we attempt to tell him what is wanted.    Let us go to the next important topic. Training the Night Hunter,  with due respect and humility. Success in training a fine performer  is a credit to a man; failure is a discredit. Heed well the advice of  experienced men, and profit by their mistakes.      [Illustration: A Lover of Good Dogs.]        CHAPTER III.    TRAINING THE HUNTING DOG.    In training hounds, one should remember that they will always have a  hobby for the first game they learn to hunt; therefore, we should be  careful to start them first at the right kind as for instance: If you  desire to have an all around hound that will hunt coon, fox and  rabbit and to hunt each game well, and in order to succeed you must  break him in on coon first, then when he knows the \"A, B, C,\" of Mr.  Coon, you can break him on foxes and then on rabbits in the day time  and when you will hunt coon he will pay no attention to the fox or  rabbit even if he would see one in front of him, providing there are  coons in that bush.    If you desire to have a true deer hound, train him first on deer,  then on foxes, but you must in all cases train them well on one kind  before you start on another; therefore, a hound thus trained will  always hunt deer in preference to fox. The same would exist if the  dog was first trained on the fox.    Some people claim that it takes from three to five years to train a  hound right. Well, this is not always the case. Young hounds twelve  to fifteen months old are often taken from the city into the bush and  in three days would hunt deer as well as other dogs of five and six  years' training. The reason for this is that these dogs take as  naturally to hunting as ducks do to water. These dogs are born with  the hunting instinct in them and being very intelligent, will start  at once to beat a bush as well as an old timer, as soon as they have  seen the game once they will remember it all their life and you can  train them to hunt any kind whether it is a bear, deer, fox, etc.    Of a necessity in treating on the general subject of training hunting  dogs, some suggestions are applicable to all kinds, while others have  individual bearing. Under the subject of this chapter will be given  subdivisions relating to specific training for specific hunting in so  far as required.    There are some fundamental lessons that all hunting dogs should be  taught to do and some things which he is not to do.    Let him begin to follow you when he is three or four months old; take  him through herds of sheep and cattle, and if he starts after them,  scold him; if he continues chasing them, whip him. I do not believe  in whipping where it can be avoided, but if compelled to, do not take  a club or a No. 10 boot, but a switch; and I never correct a dog by  pulling his ears for fear of hurting his hearing, as a dog that is  hard of hearing is not an A No. 1 dog. Never set your dog on stock of  any kind nor allow him to run after other dogs or house-cats.      [Illustration: \"The Fox Hound is a Composite Animal.\"]    By the time he is four months old, he will likely begin to run  rabbits, but some do not commence until older. Let him run them as it  will teach him to trail and harden his muscles, and, should you have  more than one, it will teach them to depend on each other, and they  will soon learn to go to other dogs when they start a trail or pick  up a loss. If you have a fox or coon hide to drag or a pet to lead,  it will not do any harm, though I do not think it of much value as  they soon learn to associate your tracks with those of the fox or  coon, and I greatly prefer letting them run rabbits as a mode of  training them.    By the time they are eight months old, take them out with a slow dog  that runs and barks a great deal, both trailing and running, and as  soon as the fox is running, let your pup go, but do not let him go  until the old dog has passed with the fox. Should you let him go  meeting the old dog he may take the back track, but if you wait until  the old dog has passed your pup, he will come in behind, and, if he  is bred right, will go in and stay as long as he can find a trail to  follow.    If he should come out after a short run, keep him until the fox is  tired; then let him go again, and if he still continues to come out  after a few times, don't fool with him, but try him for something  else. If your pup has been in good trim, and has come out three times  on fair trials, there is very little chance of making"]]]
