I am now willing, in the next place, to say a few  things to those that endeavor to prove that our constitution is but of  late time, for this reason, as they pretend, that the Greek writers have  said nothing about us; after which I shall produce testimonies for our  antiquity out of the writings of foreigners; I shall also demonstrate  that such as cast reproaches upon our nation do it very unjustly.    12. As for ourselves, therefore, we neither inhabit a maritime country,  nor do we delight in merchandise, nor in such a mixture with other men  as arises from it; but the cities we dwell in are remote from the sea,  and having a fruitful country for our habitation, we take pains in  cultivating that only. Our principal care of all is this, to educate our  children well; and we think it to be the most necessary business of  our whole life to observe the laws that have been given us, and to  keep those rules of piety that have been delivered down to us. Since,  therefore, besides what we have already taken notice of, we have had a  peculiar way of living of our own, there was no occasion offered us in  ancient ages for intermixing among the Greeks, as they had for mixing  among the Egyptians, by their intercourse of exporting and importing  their several goods; as they also mixed with the Phoenicians, who  lived by the sea-side, by means of their love of lucre in trade and  merchandise. Nor did our forefathers betake themselves, as did some  others, to robbery; nor did they, in order to gain more wealth, fall  into foreign wars, although our country contained many ten thousands of  men of courage sufficient for that purpose. For this reason it was that  the Phoenicians themselves came soon by trading and navigation to be  known to the Grecians, and by their means the Egyptians became known  to the Grecians also, as did all those people whence the Phoenicians in  long voyages over the seas carried wares to the Grecians. The Medes also  and the Persians, when they were lords of Asia, became well known to  them; and this was especially true of the Persians, who led their armies  as far as the other continent [Europe]. The Thracians were also known to  them by the nearness of their countries, and the Scythians by the  means of those that sailed to Pontus; for it was so in general that all  maritime nations, and those that inhabited near the eastern or western  seas, became most known to those that were desirous to be writers; but  such as had their habitations further from the sea were for the most  part unknown to them which things appear to have happened as to Europe  also, where the city of Rome, that hath this long time been possessed  of so much power, and hath performed such great actions in war, is yet  never mentioned by Herodotus, nor by Thucydides, nor by any one of their  contemporaries; and it was very late, and with great difficulty, that  the Romans became known to the Greeks. Nay, those that were reckoned the  most exact historians [and Ephorus for one] were so very ignorant of the  Gauls and the Spaniards, that he supposed the Spaniards, who inhabit so  great a part of the western regions of the earth, to be no more than one  city. Those historians also have ventured to describe such customs as  were made use of by them, which they never had either done or said; and  the reason why these writers did not know the truth of their affairs was  this, that they had not any commerce together; but the reason why they  wrote such falsities was this, that they had a mind to appear to know  things which others had not known. How can it then be any wonder, if our  nation was no more known to many of the Greeks, nor had given them any  occasion to mention them in their writings, while they were so remote  from the sea, and had a conduct of life so peculiar to themselves?    13. Let us now put the case, therefore, that we made use of this  argument concerning the Grecians, in order to prove that their nation  was not ancient, because nothing is said of them in our records: would  not they laugh at us all, and probably give the same reasons for our  silence that I have now alleged, and would produce their neighbor  nations as witnesses to their own antiquity? Now the very same  thing will I endeavor to do; for I will bring the Egyptians and the  Phoenicians as my principal witnesses, because nobody can complain Of  their testimony as false, on account that they are known to have borne  the greatest ill-will towards us; I mean this as to the Egyptians in  general all of them, while of the Phoenicians it is known the Tyrians  have been most of all in the same ill disposition towards us: yet do  I confess that I cannot say the same of the Chaldeans, since our first  leaders and ancestors were derived from them; and they do make mention  of us Jews in their records, on account of the kindred there is between  us. Now when I shall have made my assertions good, so far as concerns  the others, I will demonstrate that some of the Greek writers have made  mention of us Jews also, that those who envy us may not have even this  pretense for contradicting what I have said about our nation.    14. I shall begin with the writings of the Egyptians; not indeed of  those that have written in the Egyptian language, which it is impossible  for me to do. But Manetho was a man who was by birth an Egyptian, yet  had he made himself master of the Greek learning, as is very evident;  for he wrote the history of his own country in the Greek tongue, by  translating it, as he saith himself, out of their sacred records;  he also finds great fault with Herodotus for his ignorance and false  relations of Egyptian affairs. Now this Manetho, in the second book of  his Egyptian History, writes concerning us in the following manner. I  will set down his very words, as if I were to bring the very man himself  into a court for a witness: \"There was a king of ours whose name was  Timaus. Under him it came to pass, I know not how, that God was averse  to us, and there came, after a surprising manner, men of ignoble birth  out of the eastern parts, and had boldness enough to make an expedition  into our country, and with ease subdued it by force, yet without  our hazarding a battle with them. So when they had gotten those that  governed us under their power, they afterwards burnt down our cities,  and demolished the temples of the gods, and used all the inhabitants  after a most barbarous manner; nay, some they slew, and led their  children and their wives into slavery. At length they made one of  themselves king, whose name was Salatis; he also lived at Memphis, and  made both the upper and lower regions pay tribute, and left garrisons  in places that were the most proper for them. He chiefly aimed to secure  the eastern parts, as fore-seeing that the Assyrians, who had then the  greatest power, would be desirous of that kingdom, and invade them; and  as he found in the Saite Nomos, [Sethroite,] a city very proper for this  purpose, and which lay upon the Bubastic channel, but with regard to a  certain theologic notion was called Avaris, this he rebuilt, and made  very strong by the walls he built about it, and by a most numerous  garrison of two hundred and forty thousand armed men whom he put into  it to keep it. Thither Salatis came in summer time, partly to gather his  corn, and pay his soldiers their wages, and partly to exercise his  armed men, and thereby to terrify foreigners. When this man had reigned  thirteen years, after him reigned another, whose name was Beon, for  forty-four years; after him reigned another, called Apachnas, thirty-six  years and seven months; after him Apophis reigned sixty-one years, and  then Janins fifty years and one month; after all these reigned Assis  forty-nine years and two months. And these six were the first rulers  among them, who were all along making war with the Egyptians, and were  very desirous gradually to destroy them to the very roots. This whole  nation was styled Hycsos, that is, Shepherd-kings: for the first  syllable Hyc, according to the sacred dialect, denotes a king, as is Sos  a shepherd; but this according to the ordinary dialect; and of these is  compounded Hycsos: but some say that these people were Arabians.\" Now  in another copy it is said that this word does not denote Kings, but,  on the contrary, denotes Captive Shepherds, and this on account of the  particle Hyc; for that Hyc, with the aspiration, in the Egyptian tongue  again denotes Shepherds, and that expressly also; and this to me seems  the more probable opinion, and more agreeable to ancient history. [But  Manetho goes on]: \"These people, whom we have before named kings,  and called shepherds also, and their descendants,\" as he says, \"kept  possession of Egypt five hundred and eleven years.\" After these, he  says, \"That the kings of Thebais and the other parts of Egypt made an  insurrection against the shepherds, and that there a terrible and long  war was made between them.\" He says further, \"That under a king, whose  name was Alisphragmuthosis, the shepherds were subdued by him, and were  indeed driven out of other parts of Egypt, but were shut up in a place  that contained ten thousand acres; this place was named Avaris.\" Manetho  says, \"That the shepherds built a wall round all this place, which was a  large and a strong wall, and this in order to keep all their possessions  and their prey within a place of strength, but that Thummosis the son  of Alisphragmuthosis made an attempt to take them by force and by siege,  with four hundred and eighty thousand men to lie rotund about them, but  that, upon his despair of taking the place by that siege, they came to a  composition with them, that they should leave Egypt, and go, without any  harm to be done to them, whithersoever they would; and that, after  this composition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#3)"],[1,"the amount of liquid for any sort of  bread-making because the condition of flour and meal varies with weather  and keeping. This applies also to sugar--hence the need for intelligence  in the use of receipts. In damp muggy weather moisture is absorbed from  the atmosphere. Upon a dry day especially if there is much wind, drying  out is inevitable. Anything that feels clammy, or that clots, should be  dried in a warm, not hot, oven. Heating flour before mixing it, taking  care not to scorch it in the least, is one small secret of light bread,  biscuit and cake. Flour in a bag may be laid in the sun with advantage.  Use judgment in mixing. Note the appearance of what you are making  closely--when it turns out extra good, set up that first condition as a  standard.           *       *       *       *       *    _Beaten Biscuit_: (Old Style.) Sift a quart of flour into a bowl or  tray, add half a teaspoon salt, then cut small into it a teacup of very  cold lard. Wet with cold water--ice water is best--into a very stiff  dough. Lay on a floured block, or marble slab, and give one hundred  strokes with a mallet or rolling pin. Fold afresh as the dough beats  thin, dredging in flour if it begins to stick. The end of beating is to  distribute air well through the mass, which, expanding by the heat of  baking, makes the biscuit light. The dough should be firm, but smooth  and very elastic. Roll to half-inch thickness, cut out with a small  round cutter, prick lightly all over the top, and bake in steady heat to  a delicate brown. Too hot an oven will scorch and blister, too cold an  one make the biscuit hard and clammy. Aim for the Irishman's \"middle  exthrame.\"    There are sundry machines which do away with beating. It is possible  also to avoid it by running the dough, after mixing, several times  through a food-chopper. Also beaten biscuit can be closely imitated by  making good puff paste, rolling, cutting out, pricking and baking--but  rather more quickly than the real thing. All these are expedients for  those who live in apartments, where the noise of beating might be held  against good neighborhood. Householders, and especially suburban ones,  should indulge in the luxury of a block or stone or marble slab--and  live happy ever after, if they can but get cooks able and willing to  make proper use of it.    _Soda Biscuit_: (Old Style.) Sift a quart of flour with a heaping  teaspoonful of baking soda. Add a good pinch of salt, rub well through  lard or butter the size of the fist, then wet with sour milk to a  moderately soft dough, roll out, working quickly, cut with small round  cutter, set in hot pans, leaving room to swell, and bake in a quick oven  just below scorching heat. Handle as lightly as possible all  through--this makes flaky biscuit.    By way of variety, roll out thin--less than a half-inch, cut with  three-inch cutter, grease lightly on top, and fold along the middle. Let  rise on top a hot stove several minutes before putting to bake. By  adding an egg, beaten light, with a heaping tablespoonful of sugar to  the dough in mixing, these doubled biscuit will be quite unlike the  usual sort.    _Salt Rising Bread_: (As Mammy Made It.) Scald a tablespoonful of sifted  cornmeal, and a teaspoonful--heaped--of salt with a pint of boiling  water, let stand ten minutes, then stir in, taking care to mix smooth,  enough dried and sifted flour to make a thick batter. Damp flour will  not rise. The batter should be almost thick enough to hold the mixing  spoon upright--but not quite thick enough. Set the mixture in warm  water--just as hot as you can bear your hand in. Keep up the heat  steadily, but never make too hot--scalding ruins everything. Keep  lightly covered, and away from draughts. Look in after an hour--if water  has risen on top, stir in more flour. Watch close--in six hours the  yeast should be foamy-light. Have ready three quarts of dry sifted  flour, make a hole in the center of it, pour in the yeast, add a trifle  more salt, a tablespoonful sugar, and half a cup of lard. Work all  together to a smooth dough, rinsing out the vessel that has held the  yeast, with warm not hot water to finish the mixing. Divide into loaves,  put in greased pans, grease lightly over the top, and set to rise, in  gentle heat. When risen bake with steady quick heat. Take from pans hot,  and cool between folds of clean cloth, spread upon a rack, or else turn  the loaves edgewise upon a clean board, and cover with cheese cloth.    To make supper-rolls, shape some of the dough into balls, brush over  with melted butter, set in a deep pan, just so they do not touch, raise  and bake the same as bread. Dough can be saved over for breakfast rolls,  by keeping it very cold, and working in at morning, a tiny pinch of soda  before shaping the balls.    _Sweet Potato Biscuit_: (Old Style.) Boil soft two large or four small  sweet potatoes, mash smooth while very hot, free of strings and eyes,  add a pinch of salt, then rub well through three cups of sifted flour.  Rub in also a generous handful of shortening, then wet up soft with two  eggs beaten very light, and sweet milk. A little sugar also if you have  a sweet tooth--but only a little. Roll to half-inch thickness, cut out  with small cutter, lay in warm pan, and bake brown in a quick oven.  Soda and buttermilk can take the place of eggs and sweet milk--in which  case the sugar is advisable. Mix the soda with the milk--enough to make  it foamy, but no more.    _Waffles_: (Mammy's.) Separate three eggs. Beat yolks and whites very  light. Add to the yolks alternately a pint of very rich sweet milk, and  handfuls of sifted flour. Enough to make a batter rather thicker than  cream. Put in also half a teaspoon--scant--of salt, and half a cup of  lard, or lard and butter, melted so it will barely run. Mix well, then  add the beaten whites of egg. Have the waffle irons hot but not  scorching--grease well with melted lard--the salt in butter will make  the batter stick. Cook quickly but take care not to burn. Lay on hot  plate--have a pitcher of melted butter to pour on. Lay the second waffle  upon the first, butter, and keep hot. It is not safe to begin serving  without at least six waffles in plate. This, of course, provided you  have several eaters with genuine appetites. Syrup can be passed with the  waffles--but it is profanation to drench them with it--strong clear  coffee, and broiled chicken are the proper accompaniments at breakfast.    _Plain Corn Bread_: (The Best.) Sift sound fresh white cornmeal, wet  with cold water to a fairly soft dough, shape it by tossing from hand to  hand into small pones, and lay them as made into a hot pan well  sprinkled with dry meal. The pan should be hot enough to brown the meal  without burning it. Make the pones about an inch thick, four inches  long, and two and a half broad. Bake quickly, taking care not to scorch,  until there is a brown crust top and bottom. For hoe-cakes make the  dough a trifle softer, lay it by handfuls upon a hot-meal-sprinkled  griddle, taking care the handfuls do not touch. Flatten to half an inch,  let brown underneath, then turn, press down and brown the upper side. Do  not let yourself be seduced into adding salt--the delight of plain  corn-bread is its affinity for fresh butter. It should be eaten drenched  with butter of its own melting--the butter laid in the heart of it after  splitting pone or hoe-cake. Salt destroys this fine affinity. It  however savors somewhat bread to be eaten butterless. Therefore Mammy  always said: \"Salt in corn-bread hit does taste so po' white-folks'y.\"  She had little patience with those neighbors of ours who perforce had no  butter to their bread.    _Egg Bread_: (Mammy's.) Beat two eggs very light with a pinch of salt,  add two cups sifted cornmeal, then wet with a pint of buttermilk in  which a teaspoonful of soda has been dissolved. Stir in a spoonful of  shortening, barely melted, mix well, and pour into well greased pans or  skillets, cook quickly, till the crust is a good brown, and serve  immediately. Or bake in muffin moulds. For delicate stomachs the  shortening can be left out, but pans or moulds must be greased extra  well. If milk is very sour, make it one-third water--this is better than  putting in more soda.    _Batter Cakes_: (Old Style.) Sift together half-cup flour, cup and a  half meal, add pinch of salt, scald with boiling water, stir smooth,  then add two eggs well beaten, and thin with sweet milk--it will take  about half a pint. Bake by spoonfuls on a hot, well-greased griddle--the  batter must run very freely. Serve very hot with fresh sausage, or fried  pigs' feet if you would know just how good batter cakes can be.    _Ash Cake_: (Pioneer.) This is possible only with wood fires--to campers  or millionaires. Make dough as for plain bread, but add the least trifle  of salt, sweep the hot hearth very clean, pile the dough on it in a  flattish mound, cover with big leaves--cabbage leaves will do at a  pinch, or even thick clean paper, then pile on embers with coals over  them and leave for an hour or more, according to size. Take up, brush  off ashes, and break away any cindery bits. Serve with new butter and  fresh buttermilk. This was sometimes the sole summer supper of very  great families in the old time. Beyond a doubt, ash cake properly cooked  has a savory sweetness possible to no other sort of corn bread.    _Mush Bread_: (Overton Receipt.) To a quart of very thick mush, well  salted, add three fresh eggs, breaking them in one after the other, and  beating hard between. When smooth add half a cup of rich milk, and half  a cup melted butter. Stir hard, then add one teaspoonful baking powder,  and bake quickly. Bake in the serving dish as it is too soft for turning  out, requiring to be dipped on the plates with a spoon. Hence the name  in some mouths: \"Spoon bread.\"    _Cracklin' Bread_: (Pioneer.) Sift a pint of meal, add a pinch of"]]]
