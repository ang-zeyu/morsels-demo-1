Princess Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold chicken to make a half pint, add the juice of half  a lemon, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, twelve  walnuts chopped very fine, a half teaspoonful of paprika and a half  teaspoonful of salt. Put this mixture between thin slices of buttered  bread, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.      Windsor Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a half pint, add a half  cupful of finely chopped celery, a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of  pepper and four tablespoonfuls of cream; mix. Chop sufficient cold  boiled ham or tongue to make a half pint, add a tablespoonful of tomato  catsup, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of pepper. Trim  the crusts from an entire loaf of bread, butter the end of the loaf and  cut off a thin slice, and so continue until you have the desired  quantity of bread.    Shred one head of Romaine or a bunch of cress. This of course must be  crisp and dry. Put a layer of the chicken mixture on the buttered side  of a slice of bread, put on top another slice of buttered bread, then a  thick layer of the shredded cress or Romaine. Put a thick layer of the  tongue mixture on another slice of bread and cover it over the cress.  Press firmly together and cut the slices directly into halves the long  way. Wrap in waxed paper or tie with baby ribbon. Served at afternoon  teas. If well made, they are the most elaborate and dainty of all  sandwiches.      Tea Biscuit Sandwiches    Put one quart of flour into a bowl; add four level teaspoonfuls of  baking powder, a teaspoonful of salt, and sift. Rub in two level  tablespoonfuls of butter and add sufficient milk to make a dough. This  dough must not be soft, but must be sufficiently stiff to handle  quickly. Knead quickly and roll into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick.  Cut into good-sized round biscuits; they must be at least two and a half  to three inches in diameter. Brush them with milk and bake in a quick  oven. When done, cut the center from each biscuit, leaving a wall one  inch thick; take out the crumb. Fill this space with deviled chicken.  Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to make a pint; add gradually eight  tablespoonfuls of melted butter, cream or olive oil, a dash of cayenne,  a saltspoonful of white pepper, a saltspoonful of celery seed and a  saltspoonful of paprika. When thoroughly mixed fill the spaces just even  and send at once to the table. These are nice for porch suppers, and may  be served with either tea, coffee or chocolate, or may be used as an  accompaniment to mayonnaise of tomatoes.      Cheese Sandwiches No. 1    Butter thin slices of pumpernickel or brown bread; put between each two  slices a very thin layer of Swiss cheese, put two together, and cut into  triangles; garnish with cress.      Cheese Sandwiches No. 2    Chop fine a quarter of a pound of soft American cheese; put it into a  saucepan, add the yolk of one egg beaten with two tablespoonfuls of  cream, a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper and half a  teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Have ready cut and buttered a  sufficient number of slices of bread, either white or whole wheat. Stir  the cheese over the fire until it is thoroughly melted; take from the  fire and when cool spread it between the slices of bread and butter;  that is, spread it on one slice and cover with the other; press two  together and cut into forms.      Cheese Sandwiches No. 3    Rub or pound until perfectly smooth or well mixed one tablespoonful of  butter, two tablespoonfuls of soft club-house cheese, a tablespoonful of  grated Parmesan, a saltspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of anchovy  paste; add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar and a half saltspoonful of  pepper. Cut the bread into thin slices, toast it until it is crisp, not  hard; spread this mixture on one slice, cover it with another, and cut  into shapes.      Workman's Cheese Sandwiches    Cut slices of brown bread about a half inch thick. Do not remove the  crusts. Take a half pint of cottage cheese; press it through a sieve;  add to it two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a half teaspoonful of  salt and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream. Beat until smooth and light.  Spread each slice of bread thickly with the cheese mixture, then put a  very thin slice of white bread on top of the cheese, then cheese and  brown bread, press together. Have the outside brown bread with a layer  of cheese on each, and between the layers of cheese a slice of white  bread. These are palatable, and are very much better for the average  workman than bread and ham.      German Sandwiches    Put a half pound of Swiss cheese through the meat grinder; add to it the  yolks of two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a dash of cayenne  and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub until you have a perfectly smooth  paste. Put this mixture between layers of buttered rye bread and serve.  Do not trim the crusts nor cut.      Honolulu Sandwiches    Put two Spanish sweet peppers (pimientos), one Neufchatel cheese, one  pared and quartered apple and twelve blanched almonds through the meat  grinder. These may be put through alternately, or mixed as you grind.  Rub the mixture, add a half teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of  paprika. Spread this between thin slices of buttered white or brown  bread. Press, cut the crusts and cut into fingers.      My Favorite      ½ pound of American cheese    ½ cupful of thick sour cream    1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce    1 tablespoonful of tomato catsup    ½ teaspoonful of salt    ½ teaspoonful of paprika    Chop or mash the cheese, add gradually the cream, and when smooth add  all the other ingredients.

Peel the tomato and cut it into halves; squeeze out the  seeds and chop the flesh quite fine. Add one finely chopped sweet red  pepper. Add a half teaspoonful of salt and a little black pepper; mix  and spread between slices of white bread, or you may use one slice of  white with one slice of whole wheat bread. These are usually served cut  into rounds with an ordinary cake cutter. If you cut these economically  you can make one good sized round sandwich and a crescent from each, or  if you use a very small cutter you should make four round sandwiches.      Curry Sandwiches    Rub one Neufchatel or Philadelphia cream cheese to a paste. Add one  pimiento, chopped fine; a dozen almonds put through the meat grinder; a  dozen pecan meats, also ground; a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a  level teaspoonful of curry and two tablespoonfuls of desiccated grated  cocoanut. Mix thoroughly, add sufficient olive oil to make a smooth  paste, and spread between thin, unbuttered slices of white bread; trim  the crusts and cut into long fingers. These are nice to serve with plain  lettuce salad at dinner.      Deviled Cheese Sandwiches    Put one pound of American cheese through your meat chopper. Add two  tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one teaspoonful of Worcestershire  sauce, a half teaspoonful of paprika, a dash of cayenne, two  tablespoonfuls of olive oil or melted butter, four tablespoonfuls of  sherry and a half teaspoonful of salt.

Roquefort Sandwiches    Mash a quarter of a pound of Roquefort cheese, adding gradually  sufficient melted butter to make a paste. Spread this between slices of  buttered bread, press together, trim the crusts, and cut into fingers.      Camembert Sandwiches    Spread Camembert cheese between slices of buttered whole wheat bread,  trim the crusts and cut into shape. These may be served after lunch with  coffee, or are exceedingly nice for picnics or for afternoons where  coffee is served.      Cottage Cheese Sandwiches    These are nice for country picnics. The cottage cheese should be made  rather dry. After it has drained and is quite dry, moisten it by adding  either thick cream or melted butter; do not make it too soft. Add a  saltspoonful of black pepper and a palatable seasoning of salt. Spread  between slices of buttered whole wheat or white bread, press the two  together, trim the crusts and cut into shape.      Salt-Cucumber Sandwiches    Spread the bread, and cut the slices about half an inch thick. Then cut  a German or Holland cucumber into very thin slices; put these slices all  over the bread. Take the center from a head of lettuce; hold it  together, and slice it down in sort of shreds; put this over the  cucumber, and have ready some white meat of chicken, cut into the  thinnest possible slices, and cover the lettuce with chicken; then  sprinkle over more shredded lettuce and a little mayonnaise; put over  another slice of buttered bread; press the two together, trim into shape  and serve on a napkin in a pretty wicker basket.      Cucumber Sandwiches    These are very nice to serve with a fish course in place of bread or  rolls and a salad. Slice the cucumbers very thin and soak them in ice  water for one or two hours. They must be crisp and brittle and made just  at serving time. Beat together three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, one  tablespoonful of vinegar, a saltspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper;  stand this dressing on the ice until it thickens. Butter thin slices of  bread, cover them with a layer of cucumbers that have been drained and  dried on a napkin, sprinkle over the dressing, put on another layer of  buttered bread.

Her nursery was shared by two other cubs.  Blind, helpless, murmuring little balls of fur, they were tended  lovingly by the dam.    Soon the thin membrane between their eyelids dried and parted, and they  awoke to a keen interest in their surroundings. Their chamber was dimly  lit by the hole above; and the cubs, directly they were able to crawl,  feebly climbed to a recess behind the shaft, where they blinked at the  clouds that sailed beneath the dome of June, and at the stars that  peeped out when night drew on, or watched the limpid water as, flowing  past the end of the pipe below, it bore along a twirling leaf or rolled  a pebble down the river-bed. Occasionally a salmon-pink wandered across  from the shallows; for a moment or two the play of its tiny fins was  seen at the edge of the pipe; and the cubs, excited by a sight of their  future prey, stretched their necks and knowingly held their heads  askew, so that no movement of the fish might escape their observation.    Among flesh-eating mammals of many kinds, the females display signs of  intelligence earlier than the males. Lutra being the only female among  the cubs, she naturally grew to be the most keenly observant, and often  identified the finny visitor before her brothers ventured to decide that  it was not a moving twig.    The dam spent most of the day asleep in the \"holt,\" and most of the  night fishing in the pools. Inheriting the disposition of their kind,  the cubs also were more particularly lively by night than by day.  Directly the cold dew-mist wreathed the grass at the entrance of the  burrow, they commenced to sport and play, tumbling over each other,  grunting and fighting in mimic anger, or pretending to startle their  mother directly she entered the pipe on returning at intervals from  fishing.    One night, while the cubs were rougher than ever in their fun, Lutra  slipped off the platform and fell headlong down the pipe into the  stream. But almost before she had time to be frightened she discovered  that to swim was as easy as to play; and she rose to the surface with a  faint, flute-like call. She splashed somewhat wildly, for her stroke was  not yet perfected by practice. Hearing the commotion and instantly  recognising its meaning, the dam dived quietly and swiftly right beneath  the cub, and bore her gently back to the platform, where the rest of the  family, having missed their companion, had for the moment ceased to romp  and fight.    A few nights after this incident, the mother commenced in earnest to  educate her young. Tenderly taking each in turn, she carried the  nurslings into the water, and taught them, by a method and in language  known only to themselves, how to dive and swim with the least possible  exertion and disturbance.    Henceforward, throughout the summer, and till the foliage on the trees  near the pool, chilled by the rapid fall of the temperature every  evening, became thinner in the breath of the early autumn wind, the  otter-cubs fished, and frolicked, and slept, or were suckled by their  dam. Sometimes the whole family, together with the old dog-otter,  adjourned to the middle of the meadow, and in the tall, dew-drenched  grass skipped like kittens, though with comical clumsiness rather than  with the agility they displayed in the water. Like kittens, too, the  cubs played with their mother, in spite of wholesome chastisement when  they nipped her muzzle rather more severely than even long-suffering  patience could allow. The dam was at all times loath to correct her  offspring, but the sire rarely endured the familiarity of the cubs for  long. Directly they became unduly presumptuous he lumbered off to the  river, as if he considered it much more becoming to fish than to join in  the sport of his progeny. Perhaps, indeed, he deemed a change of  surroundings essential that he might forget the liberties taken with him  by his disrespectful youngsters.    When about three months old, Lutra began to show promise of that grace  of form and motion which in later life was to be one of her chief  distinctions. Her body, tail, and head gradually lengthened; and, as her  movements in the water became more sinuous and easy, she tired less  rapidly when fishing.    Autumn passed on towards winter, the nights were long, the great harvest  of the leaves fell thickly on the meadow and the stream, the mountain  springs were loosed in muddy torrents, and the river roared, swollen and  turbid, past the \"holt\" under the trailing alder-twigs. The moorhens  came back from the ponds where they had nested in April and May; the  wild duck and the teal flew south from oversea, and in the night  descended circling to the pool; a dabchick from the wild gorge  down-river took up his abode in the sedges.    The quick jerk of the dabchick's oar-like wings caused much wonder to  Lutra, when, walking on the river-bed, she looked up towards the moonlit  sky, and saw the little grebe dive like a dark phantom into the deep  hole beneath the rocky ledges of Penpwll. Once the otter-cub, acting  under an irresistible impulse, swam towards the bird and tried to seize  him. She managed to grip one of his feet, as they trailed behind him  while he dived, but the grebe escaped, leaving in the assailant's mouth  only a morsel of flesh torn from a claw.    In the warm evenings of late summer and the first weeks of autumn, the  angler usually visited the shingle opposite the water-pipe, and waded  up-stream casting for trout. The otter-cubs, grown wiser than when the  angler saw them near the sycamore, discreetly stayed at home, for they  had been taught to regard this strange being, Man, known by his peculiar  footfall and upright walk, as a dreaded enemy scarcely less formidable  than the hounds and the terriers that at intervals accompanied him for  the express purpose of hunting such river-folk as otters and rats.    As yet Lutra had never seen the hounds, nor, till the following summer,  was she to know the import of her instinctive timidity. Roaming, hungry,  and venturesome, she had chanced at nightfall to catch a glimpse, during  an occasional gleam of moonlight, of a large trout struggling  frantically on the surface of the water not far from the angler, had  heard the click of the reel and the swish of the landing net, and had  concluded that these mysterious proceedings gave cause for fear.    The end of October drew nigh; and, when the last golden leaves began to  fall from the beeches, the angler ceased to frequent the riverside.  Henceforward, except when a sportsman passed with his gun, the otters'  haunt remained in peace.    Always at break of day, however, when the pigeons left their roosting  places in the pines, an old, decrepit woman tottered down the steps from  the cottage door to the rock at the brim of the pool, and filled her  pails with water. But the creatures felt little alarm: they had become  accustomed to her presence in the dawn. Lonely and childless and poor,  she knew more than any one else of the otters; but she kept their  whereabouts a secret, for the creatures lent an interest to her  cheerless, forsaken life, and recalled to her halting memory the long  past days when her husband told her tales of hunting and fishing as she  sat, a young and pretty girl, at her spinning wheel in the light of the  flickering \"tallow-dip.\"    Warm, cloudy weather continued from the late autumn through the  winter--except for a few days of frost and snow in December--so that  food was never scarce, and Lutra thrived and grew. The great migration  of salmon took place, but she was not sufficiently big and strong to  grip and hold these monster fish. Her own weight hardly exceeded that of  the smallest of them, so she had to be content with a mixed diet of  salmon-fry and trout, varied with an occasional slug or snail that she  chanced to find in the meadow. For a brief period after the fall of snow  in December, the frost fettered the fields, and the moon shone nightly  on a white waste through which the river flowed, like a black, uneven  line, between its hoar-fringed banks. Then Lutra, bold in the unbroken  stillness of Nature's perfect sleep, climbed the steps leading to a  village garden, and searched the refuse heap for scraps discarded from  the cottager's meagre board. She even wandered further, crossed the  road, and passed under a gate into the fields near the outlying stables  of the inn. Here some birds had roosted in the hazels by the fence, and  the cub stood watching them, like the fox beneath the desired but  distant grapes.    A rough, mongrel sheep-dog, having missed his master, who had been  carousing in the inn that evening, chanced to be trotting homeward to  the farm on the hill, and, sniffing at the gate, discovered the cub in  the hedgerow. With a mad yell the dog tore through the briars at the  side of the gate-post; but Lutra was equally quick, and by the time her  enemy was in the field she had dodged under the bars and was shuffling  away, as quickly as her short legs permitted, down the garden to the  river. The dog turned, crashed back through the briars, and gained  rapidly on the otter. He reached her just as she gained the top of the  wall that, on a level with the garden, formed a barrier against the  river-floods. Lutra felt a sharp nip on her flank, and was bowled over  by the impetuous rush of her foe; but she regained her feet in an  instant, and jumped without hesitation into the water. The river was  shallow where she fell; the dog followed her; and for a moment she was  in deadly peril. But before the sheep-dog recovered from his sudden  plunge, Lutra swam into the deep water and dived straight for home,  leaving the plucky mongrel standing in the ripples, with a look of  almost human disgust and astonishment on his intelligent face. He may  have reasoned thus: \"Surely I caught"]]]
