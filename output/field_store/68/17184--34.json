The  gemmules apparently lie dormant for some little time, but incessant  reproduction is carried on by means of external buds, a very rare method  of reproduction among the freshwater sponges.    The facts just stated prove that considerable specific idiosyncrasy  exists as regards the biology of the sponges, hydroids, and polyzoa of  stagnant water in Bengal; but an even more striking instance of this  phenomenon is afforded by the sponges _Spongilla bombayensis_ and  _Corvospongilla lapidosa_ in Bombay. These two sponges resemble one  another considerably as regards their mode of growth, and are found  together on the lower surface of stones. In the month of November,  however, _C. lapidosa_ is in full vegetative vigour, while _C.  bombayensis_, in absolutely identical conditions, is already reduced to  a mass of gemmules, having flourished during the \"rains.\" It is thus  clear that the effect of environment is not identical in different  species. This is more evident as regards the groups of animals under  consideration in India (and therefore probably in other tropical  countries) than it is in Europe. The subject is one well worthy of study  elsewhere than in India, for it is significant that specimens of _S.  bombayensis_ taken in November in S. Africa were in a state of activity,  thus contrasting strongly with specimens taken at the same time of year  (though not at the same season from a climatic point of view) in the  Bombay Presidency.      GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE INDIAN SPECIES.    The geographical distribution of the lower invertebrates of fresh and of  stagnant water is often an extremely wide one, probably because the  individual of many species exists at certain seasons or in certain  circumstances in a form that is not only resistant to unfavourable  environment, but also eminently capable of being transported by wind or  currents. We therefore find that some genera and even species are  practically cosmopolitan in their range, while others, so far as our  knowledge goes, appear to have an extraordinarily discontinuous  distribution. The latter phenomenon may be due solely to our ignorance  of the occurrence of obscure genera or species in localities in which  they have not been properly sought for, or it may have some real  significance as indicating that certain forms cannot always increase and  multiply even in those localities that appear most suitable for them. As  an example of universally distributed species we may take the European  polyzoa of the genus _Plumatella_ that occur in India, while of species  whose range is apparently discontinuous better examples could not be  found than the sponges _Trochospongilla pennsylvanica_ and _Spongilla  crateriformis_, both of which are only known from N. America, the  British Isles, and India.    My geographical list of the species of sponges, coelenterates, and  polyzoa as yet found in fresh water in India is modelled on Col.  Alcock's recently published list of the freshwater crabs (Potamonidae) of  the Indian Empire[B]. I follow him in accepting, with slight  modifications of my own, Blanford's physiographical rather than his  zoogeographical regions, not because I think that the latter have been  or ought to be superseded so far as the vertebrates are concerned, but  rather because the limits of the geographical distribution of aquatic  invertebrates appear to depend on different factors from those that  affect terrestrial animals or even aquatic vertebrates.         [Footnote B: Cat. Ind. Dec. Crust. Coll. Ind. Mus., part i,       fasc. ii (Potamonidae), 1910.]    \"Varieties\" are ignored in this list, because they are not considered to  have a geographical significance. The parts of India that are least  known as regards the freshwater representatives of the groups under  consideration are the valley of the Indus, the lakes of Kashmir and  other parts of the Himalayas, the centre of the Peninsula, and the basin  of the Brahmaputra. Those that are best known are the districts round  Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Bangalore, Travancore and Northern  Tenasserim. Little is known as regards Ceylon, and almost nothing as  regards the countries that surround the Indian Empire, a few species  only having been recorded from Yunnan and the Malay Peninsula, none from  Persia, Afghanistan, or Eastern Turkestan, and only one from Tibet.  Professor Max Weber's researches have, however, taught us something as  regards Sumatra and Java, while the results of various expeditions to  Tropical Africa are beginning to cast light on the lower invertebrates  of the great lakes in the centre of that continent and of the basin of  the Nile.    It is not known to what altitude the three groups range in the Himalayas  and the hills of Southern India. No sponge has been found in Indian  territory at an altitude higher than that of Bhim Tal in Kumaon (4,500  feet), and _Hydra_ is only known from the plains; but a variety of _H.  oligactis_ was taken by Capt. F. H. Stewart in Tibet at an altitude of  about 15,000 feet. _Plumatella diffusa_ flourishes at Gangtok in Sikhim  (6,100 feet), and I have found statoblasts of _P. fruticosa_ in the  neighbourhood of Simla on the surface of a pond situated at an altitude  of about 8,000 feet; Mr. R. Kirkpatrick obtained specimens of the genus  in the Botanical Gardens at Darjiling (6,900 feet), and two species have  been found at Kurseong (4,500-5,000 feet) in the same district.

He  lives in a little block-house, as humble as the commonest of those above  described, on the declivity of a brae, by a small stream, on which stand  the little scattered village of Steinschoenau. It is composed of only two  apartments below, of which his work-room is one, and which is not above ten  feet square, with just space enough to hold four little lathes for  engraving glass, at one of which he works himself, while the others are  occupied by three boys, the youngest twelve and a-half years old, the  eldest fifteen! They all engrave beautifully, pieces laid before them by  Guenther, and which they follow with a faithfulness and spirit only to be  believed on personal inspection. He was at work himself on a vase goblet,  of the shape of the usual green hock-glass, but which might contain a  bottle; it was lapis lazuli blue, enriched by a group of Bacchanalian  Cupids and vine-leaves of his own composition, and worked with a spirit and  freedom worthy of some of the masters by whose works he was surrounded.  What struck me most, was one of those exquisite little figures of  Raphael's, in his great picture of the \"Madona del Sixto,\" in the Royal  Gallery at Dresden. The cherub leaning on the parapet, with his chin  resting on one hand, as he gazes on the Virgin; it is exquisitely drawn in  pencil, a fac-simile, and pinned on the wooden wall of the engraver's  cottage, immediately opposite his seat. I asked him how he first traced on  the glass the subjects which he was to cut; he replied by taking up a plain  glass without any figure or indication on its surface, and asking me what  subject I should like engraved. On my replying that, being an old  deer-stalker, I should be very well pleased with a stag; he immediately  applied the wheel to the glass, and in five minutes by my watch, produced  one of the most splendid, spirited animals I ever saw in the forest, and  really worthy of Landseer; the stag is making a spring over some broken  palings and rough foreground, and his action and parts can only be  appreciated by those who have lived with the deer on the hill and watched  them with the feelings of a hill-man, like Guenther, who has had  opportunities of seeing the deer in his own native woods, where they  abound. I brought this glass away with me, though in itself but an inferior  article; merely as a specimen of what I had seen done by this man in the  space of five minutes, without a copy or any thing to guide him on the  smooth surface of the goblet.    I send you sketches of the artist and his dwelling; and as the portrait  exhibits, at the same time, his native costume, it will be the more  interesting, and cannot fail to give a correct idea of the character of  this Bohemian mountaineer.    [Illustration: BOHEMIAN GLASS PAINTER.]    The sketch of Guenther's House will also afford an idea of these Bohemian  artisans' dwellings, more so than any written description could do. I send  you with it a drawing of another of these picturesque houses.    There are two classes of persons engaged, on a large scale, in the  exportation of Bohemian glass--the fabricant and the collector; generally  speaking, however, the latter is the direct exporter, and he also  superintends the cutting, painting, and packing. The fabricant is more  frequently engaged in furnishing the collector, and to a great extent, with  the glass in its original and more simple forms as it comes from the  furnace, and it is then cut and painted by the cottagers who surround the  dwelling of the collector; so that many of these villages are entirely  formed by the collector and his people. Others however, employed in the  same way, cluster round the fabrique; but even their productions for the  most part go to the collectors, who have their correspondents in America,  Spain, Turkey, Greece, England, &c.    [Illustration: HOME OF CHARLES ANTOINE GUNTHER.]    As might be expected, there is a considerable difference in the designs of  different houses; some are much superior to others, both as to color and  design. Those of Egermann, in Hyda, who has added many new and valuable  discoveries in the art of making and coloring the glass, and Hoffman, in  Prague, are the best I have visited, to which may be added Zahn, in  Steinschoenau, for whom Guenter engraves. Egerman's establishment in Hyda,  for cutting, painting, and engraving, is very considerable, and exhibits  first-rate talent, which can only be appreciated by a personal inspection  of his works; and the taste and judgment of Hoffman, in Prague, in his  selections, the designs he gives, and the artists he employs, cannot be  surpassed, if equalled, in Germany. He has entirely abandoned the modern  school, and returned to the first principles of art,[3] and produces, both  in form and decorations, subjects worthy of the ancient masters.    [Illustration: RESIDENCE OF A BOHEMIAN ARTISAN.]    The glass villages are scattered all through the mountainous districts,  whose ridges, and summits, and upper ranges are covered with a forest,  which extends forty or fifty miles in length, by thirty broad; the  fabriquants maintain that the finer glass cannot be brought to perfection  but by wood heat, and hence, the glass fabriques are only to be found in  these vast forests. One of the most interesting natural formations within  this circle is the volcanic rock, called \"Spirlingstein,\" which shoots up  out of a little valley on the right bank of the Elbe crowned with a  shattered mass of natural towers and turrets which it is difficult to  believe, till closely examined, are not the ruins of one of those feudal  holds crowning the summits of so many of the hills in Bohemia. Every  village has its school, in which are to be found all the children too old  for the nursery, and too young to be employed. Several I visited contained  as many as three hundred; the specimens of their writing are beautiful,  some quite like engraving; the eldest child, whose specimen I saw, was only  thirteen; they sing most sweetly, and many accompanying themselves on the  guitar, the schoolmaster being almost always a musician, and capable of  playing two or three instruments. There is a church and good organ in each  village, and a very good choir entirely composed of these villagers, all of  whom play some instrument, and form the choir by turns, generally directed  by the schoolmaster. Some of these amateur bands play exquisitely, as an  idea may be formed by the families or communities who occasionally visit  England, and who are often from a district such as I have described, and  whose sole instruction has been that which they could pick up from each  other in their hours of recreation. At the fabrique of A. Kittls-Erben of  Kreibitz, while at dinner in the garden, and which was provided by the  hospitality of the fabriquant, and in great profusion, with a variety of  Hungarian and Bohemian wines, I observed a little girl of twelve years of  age, who came into the bower with a guitar, and while I was looking round  for the performer, the master of the fabrique lifted the little girl on a  chair, and laid a music book before her, from which she played and sang a  number of Bohemian songs with much taste and execution. All the instruction  she ever had was from the schoolmaster, who taught her during the leisure  hours of the scholars. She was an orphan, and brought up by the fabriquant.  After dinner we walked up the valley to visit a fabrique of Chichorie; in  the way I remarked a little cottage, like the rest, with its fruit-trees  and garden, but which had, in addition to its projecting roof and windows  filled with flowers, both in pots and _Bohemian glass_ vases, verandahs in  carved oak, the scroll-work of which was quite classic, and the execution  admirable. While I stopped to examine this, the fabriquant who accompanied  me remarked that the owners were makers of musical instruments. On  inquiring of what kind, he replied a variety,--violins, accordions, and  others. I was met at the door by a man whose appearance was that of a  simple cottager, and his manners indicated all the simplicity of rural  life. He was told that I wished to see some of his instruments, upon which  he bowed, slightly elevated his shoulders, and replied, that he had nothing  worth seeing, but would be happy to receive us, and showed us the way, with  that natural kindness and politeness, which distinguish the peasants of  this country. We followed him up a little carved-wood staircase, and he  ushered us into a small, yet clean apartment, where, to my surprise, I  found two rather large organs, sufficiently large for a moderate church;  one was a peculiar instrument, a pan-harmomicon, invented by himself, with  improvements and great facility and simplicity in tuning; it formed a  concert of the single organ, brass horns, and kettle drums, having a double  row of keys behind, so that the performer was masked by the instrument,  which had a handsome front; the face of it could be removed to show the  whole interior of the mechanical arrangement. A variety of other  instruments were packed in different parts of the room, some of which were  large and highly improved accordions, which, as well as the organ, are  beautifully played by the brothers,[4] of whom there are three; their  talent for music is extraordinary.    [Illustration: SPIRLINGSTEIN.]    The church in this country is still the great patron of the arts. In  _every_ little chapel, however remote or small, (and in some of the  _minute_ villages in the mountains, they are not larger than an ordinary  room,[5] though of a vast height in proportion to the length and breadth,)  is found a good organ, and always well played. There is also an amateur  choir attached to each. These chapels are decorated by paintings and"]]]
