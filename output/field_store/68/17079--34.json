From this small amount, enough of the chemical  properties of the element were learned to permit correct design of the  huge plutonium-recovery plant at Hanford, Washington. In the course of  these investigations, balances that would weigh up to 10.5 mg with a  sensitivity of 0.02 microgram were developed. The \"test tubes\" and  \"beakers\" used had internal diameters of 0.1 to 1 mm and could measure  volumes of 1/10 to 1/10,000 ml with an accuracy of 1%. The fact that  there was no intermediate stage of experimentation, but a direct  scale-up at Hanford of ten billion times, required truly heroic skill  and courage.    By 1944 sufficient plutonium was available from uranium piles (reactors)  so that it was available as target material for cyclotrons. At Berkeley  it was bombarded with 32-MeV doubly charged helium ions, and the  following reactions took place:        {94}Pu<239> ([alpha], n) {96}Cm<242> [alpha] / 150 days --> {94}Pu<238>.    This is to be read: plutonium having an atomic number of 94 (94  positively charged protons in the nucleus) and a mass number of 239 (the  whole atom weighs approximately 239 times as much as a proton), when  bombarded with alpha particles (positively charged helium nuclei) reacts  to give off a neutron and a new element, curium, that has atomic number  96 and mass number 242. This gives off alpha particles at such a rate  that half of it has decomposed in 150 days, leaving plutonium with  atomic number 94 and mass number 238. The radiochemical work leading to  the isolation and identification of the atoms of element 96 was done at  the metallurgical laboratory of the University of Chicago.    The intense neutron flux available in modern reactors led to a new  element, americium (Am), as follows:        {94}Pu<239> (n, [gamma]) {94}Pu<240> (n, [gamma]) {94}Pu<241> [beta]              --> {95}Am<241>.    The notation (n, [gamma]) means that the plutonium absorbs a neutron and  gives off some energy in the form of gamma rays (very hard x rays); it  first forms {94}Pu<240> and then {94}Pu<241>, which is unstable and gives  off fast electrons ([beta]), leaving {95}Am<241>.    Berkelium and californium, elements 97 and 98, were produced at the  University of California by methods analogous to that used for curium,  as shown in the following equations:        {95}Am<240> + [alpha] --> {97}Bk<243> + {0}n<1>,    and {96}Cm<241> + [alpha] --> {98}Cf<244> + {0}n<1>.    The next two elements, einsteinium ({99}Es) and fermium ({100}Fm), were  originally found in the debris from the thermonuclear device \"Mike,\"  which was detonated on Eniwetok atoll November 1952. (This method of  creating new substances is somewhat more extravagant than the mythical  Chinese method of burning down a building to get a roast pig.)    These elements have since been made in nuclear reactors and by  bombardment. This time the \"bullet\" was N<14> stripped of electrons till it  had a charge of +6, and the target was plutonium.    Researchers at the University of California used new techniques in  forming and identifying element 101, mendelevium. A very thin layer of  {99}Es<253> was electroplated onto a thin gold foil and was then bombarded,  from behind the layer, with 41-MeV [alpha] particles. Unchanged {99}Es<253>  stayed on the gold, but those atoms hit by [alpha] particles were  knocked off and deposited on a \"catcher\" gold foil, which was then  dissolved and analyzed (Fig. 3). This freed the new element from most of  the very reactive parent substances, so that analysis was easier. Even  so, the radioactivity was so weak that the new element was identified  \"one atom at a time\"; this is possible because its daughter element,  fermium, spontaneously fissions and releases energy in greater bursts  than any possible contaminant.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. The production of mendelevium.]    In 1957, in Stockholm, element 102 was reported found by an  international team of scientists (who called it nobelium), but diligent  and extensive research failed to duplicate the Stockholm findings.  However, a still newer technique developed at Berkeley showed the  footprints--if not the living presence--of 102 (see Fig. 4). The rare  isotope curium-246 is coated on a small piece of nickel foil, enclosed  in a helium-filled container, and placed in the heavy-ion linear  accelerator (Hilac) beam. Positively charged atoms of element 102 are  knocked off the foil by the beam, which is of carbon-12 or carbon-13  nuclei, and are deposited on a negatively charged conveyor apron. But  element 102 doesn't live long enough to be actually measured. As it  decays, its daughter product, {100}Fm<250>, is attracted onto a charged  aluminum foil where it can be analyzed. The researchers have decided  that the hen really did come first: they have the egg; therefore the hen  must have existed. By measuring the time distance between target and  daughter product, they figure that the hen-mother (element 102) must  have a half-life of three seconds.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. The experimental arrangement used in the  discovery of element 102.]    In an experiment completed in 1961, researchers at the University of  California at Berkeley unearthed similar \"footprints\" belonging to  element 103 (named lawrencium in honor of Nobel prizewinner Ernest O.  Lawrence). They found that the bombardment of californium with boron  ions released [alpha] particles which had an energy of 8.6 MeV and  decayed with a half-life of 8 +- 2 seconds. These particles can only be  produced by element 103, which, according to one scientific theory, is a  type of \"dinosaur\" of matter that died out a few weeks after creation of  the universe.    The half-life of lawrencium (Lw) is about 8 seconds, and its mass number  is thought to be 257, although further research is required to establish  this conclusively.    Research on lawrencium is complicated. Its total [alpha] activity  amounts to barely a few counts per hour. And, since scientists had the  [alpha]-particle \"footprints\" only and not the beast itself, the  complications increased. Therefore no direct chemical techniques could  be used, and element 103 was the first to be discovered solely by  nuclear methods.[A]    For many years the periodic system was considered closed at 92. It has  now been extended by at least eleven places (Table I), and one of the  extensions (plutonium) has been made in truckload lots. Its production  and use affect the life of everyone in the United States and most of the  world.    Surely the end is again in sight, at least for ordinary matter, although  persistent scientists may shift their search to the other-world \"anti\"  particles. These, too, will call for very special techniques for  detection of their fleeting presence.    Early enthusiastic researchers complained that a man's life was not long  enough to let him do all the work he would like on an element. The  situation has now reached a state of equilibrium; neither man nor  element lives long enough to permit all the desired work.    [A] In August 1964 Russian scientists claimed that they created element  104 with a half-life of about 0.3 seconds by bombarding plutomium with  accelerated neon-22 ions.      Table I.
