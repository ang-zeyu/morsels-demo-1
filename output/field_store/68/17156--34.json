The shocker was used in daylight at all six stations in the three years,  1957-'59. Collections were made at night in 1958 and 1959 at the middle  Neosho station and in 1959 at the lower Neosho station.      _Seines_    Seines of various lengths (4, 6, 12, 15, 25 and 60 feet), with  mesh-sizes varying from bobbinet to one-half inch, were used. The  4-, 12-, and 25-foot seines were used in the estimation of relative  abundance by taking ten hauls with each seine, recording all species  captured in each haul, and making a total count of all fish captured in  two of the ten hauls. The two hauls to be counted were chosen prior to  each collection from a table of random numbers. Additional selective  seining was done to ascertain the habitats occupied by different  species.    _Trap, Hoop, and Fyke Nets._--Limited use was made of unbaited trapping  devices: wire traps 2.5 feet in diameter, six feet long, covered with  one-inch-mesh chicken wire; hoop nets 1.5 feet to three feet in  diameter at the first hoop with a pot-mesh of one inch; and a fyke net  three feet in diameter at the first hoop, pot-mesh of one inch with  wings three feet in length. All of these were set parallel to the  current with the mouths downstream. The use of trapping devices was  abated because data obtained were not sufficient to justify the effort  expended.      _Gill Nets_    Gill-netting was done mostly in 1959 at the lower Neosho station. Use of  gill nets was limited because frequent slight rises in the river caused  nets to collect excessive debris, with damage to the nets.    Gill nets used were 125 feet long, six feet deep, with mesh sizes of  3/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches. Nets, weighted to sink, were placed at right  angles to the current and attached at the banks with rope.      _Sodium Cyanide_    Pellets of sodium cyanide were used infrequently to collect fish from a  moderately fast riffle over gravel bottom that was overgrown with  willows, making seining impossible. The pellets were dissolved in a  small amount of water, a seine was held in place, and the cyanide  solution was introduced into the water a short distance upstream from  the seine, causing incapacitated fish to drift into the seine. Most of  these fish that were placed in uncontaminated water revived.      _Rotenone_    Rotenone was used in a few small pools in efforts to capture complete  populations. This method was used to check the validity of other  methods, and to reduce the possibility that rare species would go  undetected. Rotenone was applied by hand, and applications were  occasionally supplemented by placing rotenone in a container that was  punctured with a small hole and suspended over the water at the head of  a riffle draining into the area being poisoned. This maintained a toxic  concentration in the pool for sufficient time to obtain the desired  kill. Rotenone acts more slowly than cyanide, allowing more of the  distressed fish to rise to the surface.      _Dyes_    Bismark Brown Y was used primarily at the upper Neosho station to stain  large numbers of small fish. The dye was used at a dilution of 1:20,000.  Fishes were placed in the dye-solution for three hours, then  transferred to a live-box in midstream for variable periods (ten minutes  to twelve hours) before release.      _Determination of Abundance_    In the accounts of species that follow, the relative terms \"abundant,\"  \"common,\" and \"rare\" are used. Assignment of one of these terms to each  species was based on analysis of data that are presented in Tables 9-16,  (pages 402, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 411, 414-415, and 416). The number  of fish caught per unit of effort with the shocker (Table 10) and with  seines (Table 11) constitute the main basis for statements about the  abundance of each species at all stations except the upper Neosho  station. Species listed in each Table (10 and 11) are those that were  taken consistently by the method specified in the caption of the table;  erratically, but in large numbers at least once, by that method; and  those taken by the method specified but not the other method.    For the species listed in Table 10, the following usually applies:  abundant=more than three fish caught per hour; common=one to three fish  caught per hour; rare=less than one fish caught per hour.    Tables 12-16 list all fish obtained at the upper Neosho station by means  of the shocker, seines, and rotenone.      _Names of Fishes_    Technical names of fishes are those that seem to qualify under the  International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Vernacular names are  those in Special Publication No. 2 (1960) of the American Fisheries  Society, with grammatical modifications required for use in the  University of Kansas Publications, Museum of Natural History.          ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES      #Lepisosteus osseus# (Linnaeus)    Long-nosed Gar    The long-nosed gar was abundant at the lower and middle Neosho stations  and the lower Marais des Cygnes station. Numbers increased slightly in  the period of study, probably because of increased, continuous flow. The  long-nosed gar was not taken at the upper Neosho station. At lower  stations the fish occurred in many habitats, but most commonly in pools  where gar often were seen with their snouts protruding above the water  in midstream. Gar commonly lie quietly near the surface, both by day and  by night, and are therefore readily collected by means of the shocker.  Twice, at night, gar jumped into the boat after being shocked.    Young-of-the-year were taken at the middle and lower stations on both  the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes rivers, and all were near shore in  quiet water. Many young-of-the-year were seined at the lower Neosho  station on 18 June 1959, near the lower end of a gravel-bar in a small  backwater-area having a depth of one to three inches, a muddy bottom,  and a higher temperature than the mainstream. Forty-three of these young  gar averaged 2.1 inches in total length (T.L.).    Comparison of sizes of long-nosed gar taken by means of the shocker and  gill nets at the lower and middle Neosho stations revealed that: the  average size at each station remained constant from 1957 to 1959; the  average size was greater at the lower than at the middle station; and,  with the exception of young-of-the-year, no individual shorter than 13  inches was found at the middle station and only one shorter than 16  inches was taken at the lower station (Table 5).    Because collecting was intensive and several methods were used, I think  that the population of gars was sampled adequately. Wallen (_Fishes of  the Verdigris River in Oklahoma_, 1958:29 [mimeographed copy of  dissertation, Oklahoma State University]) took large individuals in the  mainstream of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma and small specimens from  the headwaters of some tributaries. Because I took young-of-the-year at  the lower Neosho station, it is possible that long-nosed gar move  upstream when small and then slowly downstream to the larger parts of  rivers as the fish increase in size. This pattern of size-segregation,  according to size of river, merits further investigation.    Ripe, spent, and immature long-nosed gar (38 males and 10 females) were  taken in three gill nets, set across the channel, 150 to 500 yards below  a riffle, at the lower Neosho station on June 16, 17, and 18, 1959. On  23 June, 1959, 12 males and two females were taken in gill nets set 50,  150, and 400 yards above the same riffle. Operations with the shocker  between 24 June and 10 July, 1959, yielded 29 males and three females.  The fish were taken from many kinds of habitat in a three-mile section  of the river.    Direction of movement as recorded from gill nets shows that of 67 gar  taken, 45 had moved downstream and 22 upstream into the nets. Only ten  of the above gar were taken from the nets set above the riffle; six of  the ten were captured as they moved downstream into the nets.    On one occasion I watched minnows swimming frantically about, jumping  out of the water, and crowding against the shore, presumably to avoid a  long-nosed gar that swam slowly in and out of view. I have observed  similar activity when gar fed in aquaria. Stomachs of a few gar from the  Neosho River were examined and found to contain minnows and some channel  catfish.    Long-nosed gar have a relatively long life span (Breder, 1936). This  longevity and their ability to gulp air probably insure excellent  survival through periods of adverse conditions. The population of  long-nosed gar probably would not be drastically affected even in the  event of a nearly complete failure of one or two successive hatches.  Maturity is attained at approximately 20 inches, total length.    Collections at the middle Neosho station in 1958 indicate that the  long-nosed gar is more susceptible to capture at night than in daytime  (Table 9, p. 402).      TABLE 5.

It is  possible that the \"Astronomy\" or \"Astrology\" (as Plutarch calls it) was  in turn appended to the \"Divination\". It certainly gave some account of  the principal constellations, their dates of rising and setting, and the  legends connected with them, and probably showed how these influenced  human affairs or might be used as guides. The \"Precepts of Chiron\" was  a didactic poem made up of moral and practical precepts, resembling the  gnomic sections of the \"Works and Days\", addressed by the Centaur Chiron  to his pupil Achilles.    Even less is known of the poem called the \"Great Works\": the title  implies that it was similar in subject to the second section of the  \"Works and Days\", but longer. Possible references in Roman writers  [1106] indicate that among the subjects dealt with were the cultivation  of the vine and olive and various herbs. The inclusion of the judgment  of Rhadamanthys (frag. 1): 'If a man sow evil, he shall reap evil,'  indicates a gnomic element, and the note by Proclus [1107] on \"Works  and Days\" 126 makes it likely that metals also were dealt with. It is  therefore possible that another lost poem, the \"Idaean Dactyls\", which  dealt with the discovery of metals and their working, was appended to,  or even was a part of the \"Great Works\", just as the \"Divination by  Birds\" was appended to the \"Works and Days\".          II. The Genealogical Poems:    The only complete poem of the genealogical group is the \"Theogony\",  which traces from the beginning of things the descent and vicissitudes  of the families of the gods. Like the \"Works and Days\" this poem has no  dramatic plot; but its unifying principle is clear and simple. The gods  are classified chronologically: as soon as one generation is catalogued,  the poet goes on to detail the offspring of each member of that  generation. Exceptions are only made in special cases, as the Sons of  Iapetus (ll. 507-616) whose place is accounted for by their treatment  by Zeus. The chief landmarks in the poem are as follows: after the  first 103 lines, which contain at least three distinct preludes,  three primeval beings are introduced, Chaos, Earth, and Eros--here an  indefinite reproductive influence. Of these three, Earth produces  Heaven to whom she bears the Titans, the Cyclopes and the hundred-handed  giants. The Titans, oppressed by their father, revolt at the instigation  of Earth, under the leadership of Cronos, and as a result Heaven and  Earth are separated, and Cronos reigns over the universe. Cronos knowing  that he is destined to be overcome by one of his children, swallows each  one of them as they are born, until Zeus, saved by Rhea, grows up and  overcomes Cronos in some struggle which is not described. Cronos is  forced to vomit up the children he had swallowed, and these with Zeus  divide the universe between them, like a human estate. Two events mark  the early reign of Zeus, the war with the Titans and the overthrow of  Typhoeus, and as Zeus is still reigning the poet can only go on to give  a list of gods born to Zeus by various goddesses. After this he formally  bids farewell to the cosmic and Olympian deities and enumerates the sons  born of goddess to mortals. The poem closes with an invocation of the  Muses to sing of the 'tribe of women'.    This conclusion served to link the \"Theogony\" to what must have been  a distinct poem, the \"Catalogues of Women\". This work was divided into  four (Suidas says five) books, the last one (or two) of which was known  as the \"Eoiae\" and may have been again a distinct poem: the curious  title will be explained presently. The \"Catalogues\" proper were a series  of genealogies which traced the Hellenic race (or its more important  peoples and families) from a common ancestor. The reason why women are  so prominent is obvious: since most families and tribes claimed to be  descended from a god, the only safe clue to their origin was through a  mortal woman beloved by that god; and it has also been pointed out that  'mutterrecht' still left its traces in northern Greece in historical  times.    The following analysis (after Marckscheffel) [1108] will show the  principle of its composition. From Prometheus and Pronoia sprang  Deucalion and Pyrrha, the only survivors of the deluge, who had a son  Hellen (frag. 1), the reputed ancestor of the whole Hellenic race. From  the daughters of Deucalion sprang Magnes and Macedon, ancestors of the  Magnesians and Macedonians, who are thus represented as cousins to the  true Hellenic stock. Hellen had three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus,  parents of the Dorian, Ionic and Aeolian races, and the offspring  of these was then detailed. In one instance a considerable and  characteristic section can be traced from extant fragments and notices:  Salmoneus, son of Aeolus, had a daughter Tyro who bore to Poseidon two  sons, Pelias and Neleus; the latter of these, king of Pylos, refused  Heracles purification for the murder of Iphitus, whereupon Heracles  attacked and sacked Pylos, killing amongst the other sons of Neleus  Periclymenus, who had the power of changing himself into all manner of  shapes. From this slaughter Neleus alone escaped (frags. 13, and  10-12). This summary shows the general principle of arrangement of the  \"Catalogues\": each line seems to have been dealt with in turn, and the  monotony was relieved as far as possible by a brief relation of famous  adventures connected with any of the personages--as in the case of  Atalanta and Hippomenes (frag. 14). Similarly the story of the Argonauts  appears from the fragments (37-42) to have been told in some detail.    This tendency to introduce romantic episodes led to an important  development. Several poems are ascribed to Hesiod, such as the  \"Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis\", the \"Descent of Theseus into  Hades\", or the \"Circuit of the Earth\" (which must have been  connected with the story of Phineus and the Harpies, and so with the  Argonaut-legend), which yet seem to have belonged to the \"Catalogues\".  It is highly probable that these poems were interpolations into the  \"Catalogues\" expanded by later poets from more summary notices in the  genuine Hesiodic work and subsequently detached from their contexts  and treated as independent. This is definitely known to be true of the  \"Shield of Heracles\", the first 53 lines of which belong to the  fourth book of the \"Catalogues\", and almost certainly applies to other  episodes, such as the \"Suitors of Helen\" [1109], the \"Daughters of  Leucippus\", and the \"Marriage of Ceyx\", which last Plutarch mentions as  'interpolated in the works of Hesiod.'    To the \"Catalogues\", as we have said, was appended another work, the  \"Eoiae\". The title seems to have arisen in the following way [1110]:  the \"Catalogues\" probably ended (ep. \"Theogony\" 963 ff.) with some such  passage as this: 'But now, ye Muses, sing of the tribes of women with  whom the Sons of Heaven were joined in love, women pre-eminent above  their fellows in beauty, such as was Niobe (?).' Each succeeding heroine  was then introduced by the formula 'Or such as was...' (cp. frags. 88,  92, etc.). A large fragment of the \"Eoiae\" is extant at the beginning of  the \"Shield of Heracles\", which may be mentioned here. The \"supplement\"  (ll. 57-480) is nominally Heracles and Cycnus, but the greater part  is taken up with an inferior description of the shield of Heracles, in  imitation of the Homeric shield of Achilles (\"Iliad\" xviii. 478 ff.).  Nothing shows more clearly the collapse of the principles of the  Hesiodic school than this ultimate servile dependence upon Homeric  models.    At the close of the \"Shield\" Heracles goes on to Trachis to the house  of Ceyx, and this warning suggests that the \"Marriage of Ceyx\" may have  come immediately after the 'Or such as was' of Alcmena in the \"Eoiae\":  possibly Halcyone, the wife of Ceyx, was one of the heroines sung in  the poem, and the original section was 'developed' into the \"Marriage\",  although what form the poem took is unknown.    Next to the \"Eoiae\" and the poems which seemed to have been developed  from it, it is natural to place the \"Great Eoiae\". This, again, as we  know from fragments, was a list of heroines who bare children to the  gods: from the title we must suppose it to have been much longer that  the simple \"Eoiae\", but its extent is unknown. Lehmann, remarking that  the heroines are all Boeotian and Thessalian (while the heroines of  the \"Catalogues\" belong to all parts of the Greek world), believes the  author to have been either a Boeotian or Thessalian.    Two other poems are ascribed to Hesiod. Of these the \"Aegimius\" (also  ascribed by Athenaeus to Cercops of Miletus), is thought by Valckenaer  to deal with the war of Aegimus against the Lapithae and the aid  furnished to him by Heracles, and with the history of Aegimius and  his sons. Otto Muller suggests that the introduction of Thetis and of  Phrixus (frags. 1-2) is to be connected with notices of the allies of  the Lapithae from Phthiotis and Iolchus, and that the story of Io was  incidental to a narrative of Heracles' expedition against Euboea. The  remaining poem, the \"Melampodia\", was a work in three books, whose plan  it is impossible to recover. Its subject, however, seems to have been  the histories of famous seers like Mopsus, Calchas, and Teiresias, and  it probably took its name from Melampus, the most famous of them all.          Date of the Hesiodic Poems    There is no doubt that the \"Works and Days\" is the oldest, as it is the  most original, of the Hesiodic poems. It seems to be distinctly earlier  than the \"Theogony\", which refers to it, apparently, as a poem already  renowned. Two considerations help us to fix a relative date for the  \"Works\". 1) In diction, dialect and style it is obviously dependent  upon Homer, and is therefore considerably later than the \"Iliad\" and  \"Odyssey\": moreover, "]]]
