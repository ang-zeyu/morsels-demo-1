For there had been but one kettle for the party.    When they had eaten, the kettle was rinsed out and the lover's friend  brought it back full of water. This the lover drank at a draught.    \"Bring me more,\" he said.    Again his friend filled the kettle at the river and again the lover  drank it dry.    \"More!\" he cried.    \"Oh, I am tired. Cannot you go to the river and drink your fill from the  stream?\" asked his friend.    \"Remember your promise.\"    \"Yes, but I am weary. Go now and drink.\"    \"Ek-hey, I feared it would be so. Now trouble is coming upon us,\" said  the lover sadly. He walked to the river, sprang in, and lying down in  the water with his head toward land, drank greedily. By and by he called  to his friend.    \"Come hither, you who have been my sworn friend. See what comes of your  broken promise.\"    The friend came and was amazed to see that the lover was now a fish from  his feet to his middle.    Sick at heart he ran off a little way and threw himself upon the ground  in grief. By and by he returned. The lover was now a fish to his neck.    \"Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?\" the friend  asked.    \"No, it is too late. But tell the chief's daughter that I loved her to  the last and that I die for her sake. Take this belt and give it to her.  She gave it to me as a pledge of her love for me,\" and he being then  turned to a great fish, swam to the middle of the river and there  remained, only his great fin remaining above the water.    The friend went home and told his story. There was great mourning over  the death of the five young men, and for the lost lover. In the river  the great fish remained, its fin just above the surface, and was called  by the Indians \"Fish that Bars,\" because it bar'd navigation. Canoes had  to be portaged at great labor around the obstruction.    The chief's daughter mourned for her lover as for a husband, nor would  she be comforted. \"He was lost for love of me, and I shall remain as his  widow,\" she wailed.    In her mother's tepee she sat, with her head covered with her robe,  silent, working, working. \"What is my daughter doing,\" her mother asked.  But the maiden did not reply.    The days lengthened into moons until a year had passed. And then the  maiden arose. In her hands were beautiful articles of clothing, enough  for three men. There were three pairs of moccasins, three pairs of  leggings, three belts, three shirts, three head dresses with beautiful  feathers, and sweet smelling tobacco.    \"Make a new canoe of bark,\" she said, which was made for her.    Into the canoe she stepped and floated slowly down the river toward the  great fish.    \"Come back my daughter,\" her mother cried in agony. \"Come back. The  great fish will eat you.\"    She answered nothing. Her canoe came to the place where the great fin  arose and stopped, its prow grating on the monster's back. The maiden  stepped out boldly. One by one she laid her presents on the fish's back,  scattering the feathers and tobacco over his broad spine.    \"Oh, fish,\" she cried, \"Oh, fish, you who were my lover, I shall not  forget you. Because you were lost for love of me, I shall never marry.  All my life I shall remain a widow. Take these presents. And now leave  the river, and let the waters run free, so my people may once more  descend in their canoes.\"    She stepped into her canoe and waited. Slowly the great fish sank, his  broad fin disappeared, and the waters of the St. Croix (Stillwater) were  free.              THE ARTICHOKE AND THE MUSKRAT    On the shore of a lake stood an artichoke with its green leaves waving  in the sun. Very proud of itself it was, and well satisfied with the  world. In the lake below lived a muskrat in his tepee, and in the  evening as the sun set he would come out upon the shore and wander over  the bank. One evening he came near the place where the artichoke stood.    \"Ho, friend,\" he said, \"you seem rather proud of yourself. Who are you?\"  \"I am the artichoke,\" answered the other, \"and I have many handsome  cousins. But who are you?\"    \"I am the muskrat, and I, too, belong to a large family. I live in the  water. I don't stand all day in one place like a stone.\"    \"If I stand in one place all day,\" retorted the artichoke, \"at least I  don't swim around in stagnant water, and build my lodge in the mud.\"    \"You are jealous of my fine fur,\" sneered the muskrat. \"I may build  my lodge in the mud, but I always have a clean coat. But you are half  buried in the ground, and when men dig you up, you are never clean.\"    \"And your fine coat always smells of musk,\" jeered the artichoke.    \"That is true,\" said the muskrat. \"But men think well of me,  nevertheless. They trap me for the fine sinew in my tail; and handsome  young women bite off my tail with their white teeth and make it into  thread.\"    \"That's nothing,\" laughed the artichoke. \"Handsome young warriors,  painted and splendid with feathers, dig me up, brush me off with their  shapely hands and eat me without even taking the trouble to wash me  off.\"            THE RABBIT AND THE BEAR WITH THE FLINT BODY    The Rabbit and his grandmother were in dire straits, because the rabbit  was out of arrows. The fall hunt would soon be on and his quiver was all  but empty. Arrow sticks he could cut in plenty, but he had nothing with  which to make arrowheads.    \"You must make some flint arrowheads,\" said his grandmother. \"Then you  will be able to kill game.\"    \"Where shall I get the flint?\" asked the rabbit.    \"From the old bear chief,\" said his old grandmother. For at that time  all the flint in the world was in the bear's body.    So the rabbit set out for the village of the Bears. It was winter time  and the lodges of the bears were set under the shelter of a hill where  the cold wind would not blow on them and where they had shelter among  the trees and bushes.    He came at one end of the village to a hut where lived an old woman. He  pushed open the door and entered. Everybody who came for flint always  stopped there because it was the first lodge on the edge of the village.  Strangers were therefore not unusual in the old woman's hut, and she  welcomed the rabbit. She gave him a seat and at night he lay with his  feet to the fire.    The next morning the rabbit went to the lodge of the bear chief. They  sat together awhile and smoked. At last the bear chief spoke.    \"What do you want, my grandson?\"    \"I have come for some flint to make arrows,\" answered the rabbit.    The bear chief grunted, and laid aside his pipe. Leaning back he pulled  off his robe and, sure enough, one half of his body was flesh and the  other half hard flint.    \"Bring a stone hammer and give it to our guest,\" he bade his wife. Then  as the rabbit took the hammer he said: \"Do not strike too hard.\"    \"Grandfather, I shall be careful,\" said the rabbit. With a stroke he  struck off a little flake of flint from the bear's body.    \"Ni-sko-ke-cha? So big?\" he asked.    \"Harder, grandson; strike off bigger pieces,\" said the bear.    The rabbit struck a little harder.    \"Ni-sko-ke-cha? So big?\" he asked.    The bear grew impatient. \"No, no, strike off bigger pieces. I can't be  here all day. Tanka kaksa wo! Break off a big piece.\"    The rabbit struck again--hard! \"Ni-sko-ke-cha?\" he cried, as the hammer  fell. But even as he spoke the bear's body broke in two, the flesh part  fell away and only the flint part remained. Like a flash the rabbit  darted out of the hut.    There was a great outcry in the village. Openmouthed, all the bears  gave chase. But as he ran the rabbit cried: \"Wa-hin-han-yo (snow, snow)  Ota-po, Ota-po--lots more, lots more,\" and a great storm of snow swept  down from the sky.    The rabbit, light of foot, bounded over the top of the snow. The bears  sunk in and floundered about helpless. Seeing this, the rabbit turned  back and killed them one by one with his club. That is why we now have  so few bears.              STORY OF THE LOST WIFE    A Dakota girl married a man who promised to treat her kindly, but he did  not keep his word. He was unreasonable, fault-finding, and often beat  her. Frantic with his cruelty, she ran away. The whole village turned  out to search for her, but no trace of the missing wife was to be found.    Meanwhile, the fleeing woman had wandered about all that day and the  next night. The next day she met a man, who asked her who she was.  She did not know it, but he was not really a man, but the chief of the  wolves.    \"Come with me,\" he said, and he led her to a large village. She was  amazed to see here many wolves--gray and black, timber wolves and  coyotes. It seemed as if all the wolves in the world were there.    The wolf chief led the young woman to a great tepee and invited her in.  He asked her what she ate for food.    \"Buffalo meat,\" she answered.    He called two coyotes and bade them bring what the young woman wanted.  They bounded away and soon returned with the shoulder of a fresh-killed  buffalo calf.    \"How do you prepare it for eating?\" asked the wolf chief.    \"By boiling,\" answered the young woman.    Again he called the two coyotes. Away they bounded and soon brought into  the tent a small bundle. In it were punk, flint and steel--stolen, it  may be, from some camp of men.    \"How do you make the meat ready?\" asked the wolf chief.    \"I cut it into slices,\" answered the young woman.    The coyotes were called and in a short time fetched in a knife in its  sheath. The young woman cut up the calf's shoulder into slices and ate  it.    Thus she lived for a year, all the wolves being very kind to her. At the  end of that time the wolf chief said to her:    \"Your people are going off on a buffalo hunt. Tomorrow at noon they will  be here.

But all three were  university bred and were natural leaders of men.    Once arrived in the wilderness, the pioneer life common to all of the  colonists began instantly to exert its slow, irresistible pressure upon  their minds and to mould them into certain ways of thinking and  feeling. Without some perception of these modes of thought and emotion  a knowledge of the spirit of our literature is impossible. Take, for  instance, the mere physical situation of the first colonists, encamped  on the very beach of the wide ocean with an illimitable forest in their  rear. Their provisions were scanty. They grew watchful of the strange  soil, of the new skies, of the unknown climate. Even upon the voyage  over, John Winthrop thought that \"the declination of the pole star was  much, even to the view, beneath that it is in England,\" and that \"the  new moon, when it first appeared, was much smaller than at any time he  had seen it in England.\" Here was a man evidently using his eyes with  a new interest in natural phenomena. Under these changed skies the mind  began gradually to change also.    At first the colonists felt themselves an outpost of Europe, a forlorn  hope of the Protestant Reformation. \"We shall be as a city upon a hill,\"  said Winthrop. \"The eyes of all people are upon us.\" Their creed was  Calvinism, then in its third generation of dominion and a European  doctrine which was not merely theological but social and political. The  emigrant Englishmen were soon to discover that it contained a doctrine  of human rights based upon human needs. At the beginning of their  novel experience they were doubtless unaware of any alteration in their  theories. But they were facing a new situation, and that new situation  became an immense factor in their unconscious growth. Their intellectual  and moral problems shifted, as a boat shifts her ballast when the wind  blows from a new quarter. The John Cotton preaching in a shed in the new  Boston had come to \"suffer a sea-change\" from the John Cotton who  had been rector of St. Botolph's splendid church in Lincolnshire.  The \"church without a bishop\" and the \"state without a king\" became a  different church and state from the old, however loyally the ancient  forms and phrases were retained.    If the political problems of equality which were latent in Calvinism now  began to take on a different meaning under the democratic conditions of  pioneer life, the inner, spiritual problems of that amazing creed were  intensified. \"Fallen\" human nature remained the same, whether in the  crowded cosmopolitan streets of Holland and London, or upon the desolate  shores of Cape Cod. But the moral strain of the old insoluble conflict  between \"fixed fate\" and \"free will\" was heightened by the physical  loneliness of the colonists. Each soul must fight its own unaided,  unending battle. In that moral solitude, as in the physical solitude of  the settlers upon the far northwestern prairies of a later epoch, many  a mind snapped. Unnatural tension was succeeded by unnatural crimes.  But for the stronger intellects New England Calvinism became a potent  spiritual gymnastic, where, as in the Swedish system of bodily training,  one lifts imaginary and ever-increasing weights with imaginary and  ever-increasing effort, flexor and extensor muscles pulling against one  another, driven by the will. Calvinism bred athletes as well as maniacs.    The new situation, again, turned many of the theoretical speculations of  the colonists into practical issues. Here, for example, was the Indian.  Was he truly a child of God, possessing a soul, and, if so, had he  partaken of the sin of Adam? These questions perplexed the saintly Eliot  and the generous Roger Williams. But before many years the query as to  whether a Pequot warrior had a soul became suddenly less important than  the practical question as to whether the Pequot should be allowed any  further chances of taking the white man's scalp. On this last issue the  colonists were unanimous in the negative.    It would be easy to multiply such instances of a gradual change of view.  But beneath all the changes and all the varieties of individual  behavior in the various colonies that began to dot the seaboard, certain  qualities demanded by the new surroundings are felt in colonial life  and in colonial writings. One of these is the instinct for order, or at  least that degree of order essential to the existence of a camp. It  was not in vain that John Smith sought to correct the early laxness at  Jamestown by the stern edict: \"He that will not work, neither shall  he eat.\" Dutch and Quaker colonies taught the same inexorable maxim  of thrift. Soon there was work enough for all, at good wages, but the  lesson had been taught. It gave Franklin's \"Poor Richard\" mottoes their  flavor of homely, experienced truth.    Order in daily life led straight to political order, just as the  equality and resourcefulness of the frontier, stimulated by isolation  from Europe, led to political independence. The pioneer learned to make  things for himself instead of sending to London for them, and by and by  he grew as impatient of waiting for a political edict from London as  he would become in waiting for a London plough. \"This year,\" wrote one  colonist, \"ye will go to complain to the Parliament, and the next year  they will send to see how it is, and the third year the government is  changed.\" The time was coming when no more complaints would be sent.    One of the most startling instances of this colonial instinct for  self-government is the case of Thomas Hooker. Trained in Emmanuel  College of the old Cambridge, he arrived in the new Cambridge in 1633.  He grew restless under its theocratic government, being, it was said,  \"a person who when he was doing his Master's work, would put a king into  his pocket.\" So he led the famous migration of 1636 from Massachusetts  to Hartford, and there helped to create a federation of independent  towns which made their own constitution without mentioning any king,  and became one of the corner-stones of American democracy. In May, 1638,  Hooker declared in a sermon before the General Court \"that the choice of  public magistrates belongs unto the people by God's own allowance,\" and  \"that they who have the power to appoint officers and magistrates, it is  in their power, also, to set the bounds and limitations of the power and  place into which they call them.\" The reason of this is: \"Because the  foundation of authority is laid, firstly, in the free consent of the  people.\" This high discourse antedates the famous pamphlets on liberty  by Milton. It is a half-century earlier than Locke's \"Treatise on  Government,\" a century and a quarter earlier than Rousseau's \"Contrat  Social,\" and it precedes by one hundred and thirty-eight years the  American Declaration of Independence.    But the slightest acquaintance with colonial writings will reveal the  fact that such political radicalism as Thomas Hooker's was accompanied  by an equally striking conservatism in other directions. One of  these conservative traits was the pioneer's respect for property, and  particularly for the land cleared by his own toil. Gladstone once spoke  of possession of the soil as the most important and most operative  of all social facts. Free-footed as the pioneer colonist was, he was  disinclined to part with his land without a substantial price for it.  The land at his disposal was practically illimitable, but he showed a  very English tenacity in safeguarding his hold upon his own portion.    Very English, likewise, was his attachment to the old country as \"home.\"  The lighter and the more serious writings of the colonists are alike in  their respect for the past. In the New England settlements, although not  at first in Virginia, there was respect for learning and for an educated  clergy. The colonists revered the Bible. They maintained a stubborn  regard for the Common Law of England. Even amid all the excitement of a  successful rebellion from the mother country, this Common Law still held  the Americans to the experience of the inescapable past.    Indeed, as the reader of today lifts his eyes from the pages of the  books written in America during the seventeenth century, and tries to  meditate upon the general difference between them and the English books  written during the same period, he will be aware of the firmness with  which the conservative forces held on this side of the Atlantic. It was  only one hundred years from the Great Armada of 1588 to the flight of  James Second, the last of the Stuart Kings. With that Revolution of 1688  the struggles characteristic of the seventeenth century in England came  to an end. A new working basis is found for thought, politics, society,  literature. But while those vast changes had been shaking England, two  generations of American colonists had cleared their forests, fought the  savages, organized their townships and their trade, put money in their  purses, and lived, though as yet hardly suspecting it, a life that was  beginning to differentiate them from the men of the Old World. We must  now glance at the various aspects of this isolated life of theirs, as it  is revealed in their books.        CHAPTER II. THE FIRST COLONIAL LITERATURE    The simplest and oldest group of colonial writings is made up of records  of exploration and adventure. They are like the letters written from  California in 1849 to the \"folks back East.\" Addressed to home-keeping  Englishmen across the sea, they describe the new world, explain the  present situation of the colonists, and express their hopes for the  future. Captain John Smith's \"True Relation,\" already alluded to, is the  typical production of this class: a swift marching book, full of eager  energy, of bluff and breezy picturesqueness, and of triumphant instinct  for the main chance.
