If  the Eye be tinged with any colour (as in the Disease of the _Jaundice_)  so as to tinge the Pictures in the bottom of the Eye with that Colour,  then all Objects appear tinged with the same Colour. If the Humours of  the Eye by old Age decay, so as by shrinking to make the _Cornea_ and  Coat of the _Crystalline Humour_ grow flatter than before, the Light  will not be refracted enough, and for want of a sufficient Refraction  will not converge to the bottom of the Eye but to some place beyond it,  and by consequence paint in the bottom of the Eye a confused Picture,  and according to the Indistinctness of this Picture the Object will  appear confused. This is the reason of the decay of sight in old Men,  and shews why their Sight is mended by Spectacles. For those Convex  glasses supply the defect of plumpness in the Eye, and by increasing the  Refraction make the Rays converge sooner, so as to convene distinctly at  the bottom of the Eye if the Glass have a due degree of convexity. And  the contrary happens in short-sighted Men whose Eyes are too plump. For  the Refraction being now too great, the Rays converge and convene in the  Eyes before they come at the bottom; and therefore the Picture made in  the bottom and the Vision caused thereby will not be distinct, unless  the Object be brought so near the Eye as that the place where the  converging Rays convene may be removed to the bottom, or that the  plumpness of the Eye be taken off and the Refractions diminished by a  Concave-glass of a due degree of Concavity, or lastly that by Age the  Eye grow flatter till it come to a due Figure: For short-sighted Men see  remote Objects best in Old Age, and therefore they are accounted to have  the most lasting Eyes.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]      AX. VIII.    _An Object seen by Reflexion or Refraction, appears in that place from  whence the Rays after their last Reflexion or Refraction diverge in  falling on the Spectator's Eye._    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    If the Object A [in FIG. 9.] be seen by Reflexion of a Looking-glass  _mn_, it shall appear, not in its proper place A, but behind the Glass  at _a_, from whence any Rays AB, AC, AD, which flow from one and the  same Point of the Object, do after their Reflexion made in the Points B,  C, D, diverge in going from the Glass to E, F, G, where they are  incident on the Spectator's Eyes. For these Rays do make the same  Picture in the bottom of the Eyes as if they had come from the Object  really placed at _a_ without the Interposition of the Looking-glass; and  all Vision is made according to the place and shape of that Picture.    In like manner the Object D [in FIG. 2.] seen through a Prism, appears  not in its proper place D, but is thence translated to some other place  _d_ situated in the last refracted Ray FG drawn backward from F to _d_.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    And so the Object Q [in FIG. 10.] seen through the Lens AB, appears at  the place _q_ from whence the Rays diverge in passing from the Lens to  the Eye. Now it is to be noted, that the Image of the Object at _q_ is  so much bigger or lesser than the Object it self at Q, as the distance  of the Image at _q_ from the Lens AB is bigger or less than the distance  of the Object at Q from the same Lens. And if the Object be seen through  two or more such Convex or Concave-glasses, every Glass shall make a new  Image, and the Object shall appear in the place of the bigness of the  last Image. Which consideration unfolds the Theory of Microscopes and  Telescopes. For that Theory consists in almost nothing else than the  describing such Glasses as shall make the last Image of any Object as  distinct and large and luminous as it can conveniently be made.    I have now given in Axioms and their Explications the sum of what hath  hitherto been treated of in Opticks. For what hath been generally  agreed on I content my self to assume under the notion of Principles, in  order to what I have farther to write. And this may suffice for an  Introduction to Readers of quick Wit and good Understanding not yet  versed in Opticks: Although those who are already acquainted with this  Science, and have handled Glasses, will more readily apprehend what  followeth.    FOOTNOTES:    [A] In our Author's _Lectiones Opticae_, Part I. Sect. IV. Prop 29, 30,  there is an elegant Method of determining these _Foci_; not only in  spherical Surfaces, but likewise in any other curved Figure whatever:  And in Prop. 32, 33, the same thing is done for any Ray lying out of the  Axis.    [B] _Ibid._ Prop. 34.          _PROPOSITIONS._        _PROP._ I. THEOR. I.    _Lights which differ in Colour, differ also in Degrees of  Refrangibility._    The PROOF by Experiments.    _Exper._ 1.    I took a black oblong stiff Paper terminated by Parallel Sides, and with  a Perpendicular right Line drawn cross from one Side to the other,  distinguished it into two equal Parts. One of these parts I painted with  a red colour and the other with a blue. The Paper was very black, and  the Colours intense and thickly laid on, that the Phaenomenon might be  more conspicuous. This Paper I view'd through a Prism of solid Glass,  whose two Sides through which the Light passed to the Eye were plane and  well polished, and contained an Angle of about sixty degrees; which  Angle I call the refracting Angle of the Prism. And whilst I view'd it,  I held it and the Prism before a Window in such manner that the Sides of  the Paper were parallel to the Prism, and both those Sides and the Prism  were parallel to the Horizon, and the cross Line was also parallel to  it: and that the Light which fell from the Window upon the Paper made an  Angle with the Paper, equal to that Angle which was made with the same  Paper by the Light reflected from it to the Eye. Beyond the Prism was  the Wall of the Chamber under the Window covered over with black Cloth,  and the Cloth was involved in Darkness that no Light might be reflected  from thence, which in passing by the Edges of the Paper to the Eye,  might mingle itself with the Light of the Paper, and obscure the  Phaenomenon thereof. These things being thus ordered, I found that if the  refracting Angle of the Prism be turned upwards, so that the Paper may  seem to be lifted upwards by the Refraction, its blue half will be  lifted higher by the Refraction than its red half. But if the refracting  Angle of the Prism be turned downward, so that the Paper may seem to be  carried lower by the Refraction, its blue half will be carried something  lower thereby than its red half. Wherefore in both Cases the Light which  comes from the blue half of the Paper through the Prism to the Eye, does  in like Circumstances suffer a greater Refraction than the Light which  comes from the red half, and by consequence is more refrangible.    _Illustration._ In the eleventh Figure, MN represents the Window, and DE  the Paper terminated with parallel Sides DJ and HE, and by the  transverse Line FG distinguished into two halfs, the one DG of an  intensely blue Colour, the other FE of an intensely red. And BAC_cab_  represents the Prism whose refracting Planes AB_ba_ and AC_ca_ meet in  the Edge of the refracting Angle A_a_. This Edge A_a_ being upward, is  parallel both to the Horizon, and to the Parallel-Edges of the Paper DJ  and HE, and the transverse Line FG is perpendicular to the Plane of the  Window. And _de_ represents the Image of the Paper seen by Refraction  upwards in such manner, that the blue half DG is carried higher to _dg_  than the red half FE is to _fe_, and therefore suffers a greater  Refraction. If the Edge of the refracting Angle be turned downward, the  Image of the Paper will be refracted downward; suppose to [Greek: de],  and the blue half will be refracted lower to [Greek: dg] than the red  half is to [Greek: pe].    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    _Exper._ 2. About the aforesaid Paper, whose two halfs were painted over  with red and blue, and which was stiff like thin Pasteboard, I lapped  several times a slender Thred of very black Silk, in such manner that  the several parts of the Thred might appear upon the Colours like so  many black Lines drawn over them, or like long and slender dark Shadows  cast upon them. I might have drawn black Lines with a Pen, but the  Threds were smaller and better defined. This Paper thus coloured and  lined I set against a Wall perpendicularly to the Horizon, so that one  of the Colours might stand to the Right Hand, and the other to the Left.  Close before the Paper, at the Confine of the Colours below, I placed a  Candle to illuminate the Paper strongly: For the Experiment was tried in  the Night. The Flame of the Candle reached up to the lower edge of the  Paper, or a very little higher. Then at the distance of six Feet, and  one or two Inches from the Paper upon the Floor I erected a Glass Lens  four Inches and a quarter broad, which might collect the Rays coming  from the several Points of the Paper, and make them converge towards so  many other Points at the same distance of six Feet, and one or two  Inches on the other side of the Lens, and so form the Image of the  coloured Paper upon a white Paper placed there, after the same manner  that a Lens at a Hole in a Window casts the Images of Objects abroad  upon a Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room. The aforesaid white Paper,  erected perpendicular to the Horizon, and to the Rays which fell upon it  from the Lens, I moved sometimes towards the Lens, sometimes from it, to  find the Places where the Images of the blue and red Parts of the  coloured Paper appeared most distinct. Those Places I easily knew by the  Images of the black Lines which I had made by winding the Silk about the  Paper. For the Images of those fine and slender Lines (which by reason  of their Blackness were like Shadows on the Colours) were confused and  scarce visible, unless when the Colours on either side of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33508"],[0,"A New Subspecies of Lizard, Cnemidophorus sacki, from Michoacán, México (#3)"],[1,"_C. calidipes_.
