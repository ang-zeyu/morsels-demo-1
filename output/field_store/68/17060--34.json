The  survivors declared war upon them, and showed in this, their first  campaign, the extraordinary ingenuity in adapting their tactics to their  adversary which has been their greatest military characteristic. The  commando which rode out to do battle with the Matabeli numbered, it is  said, a hundred and thirty-five farmers. Their adversaries were twelve  thousand spearmen. They met at the Marico River, near Mafeking. The  Boers combined the use of their horses and of their rifles so cleverly  that they slaughtered a third of their antagonists without any loss to  themselves. Their tactics were to gallop up within range of the enemy,  to fire a volley, and then to ride away again before the spearmen could  reach them. When the savages pursued the Boers fled. When the pursuit  halted the Boers halted and the rifle fire began anew. The strategy was  simple but most effective. When one remembers how often since then our  own horsemen have been pitted against savages in all parts of the world,  one deplores that ignorance of all military traditions save our own  which is characteristic of our service.    This victory of the 'voortrekkers' cleared all the country between the  Orange River and the Limpopo, the sites of what has been known as the  Transvaal and the Orange Free State. In the meantime another body of  the emigrants had descended into what is now known as Natal, and had  defeated Dingaan, the great Chief of the Zulus. Being unable, owing to  the presence of their families, to employ the cavalry tactics which had  been so effective against the Matabeli, they again used their ingenuity  to meet this new situation, and received the Zulu warriors in a square  of laagered wagons, the men firing while the women loaded. Six burghers  were killed and three thousand Zulus. Had such a formation been used  forty years afterwards against these very Zulus, we should not have had  to mourn the disaster of Isandhlwana.    And now at the end of their great journey, after overcoming the  difficulties of distance, of nature, and of savage enemies, the Boers  saw at the end of their travels the very thing which they desired  least--that which they had come so far to avoid--the flag of Great  Britain. The Boers had occupied Natal from within, but England had  previously done the same by sea, and a small colony of Englishmen  had settled at Port Natal, now known as Durban. The home Government,  however, had acted in a vacillating way, and it was only the conquest of  Natal by the Boers which caused them to claim it as a British colony.  At the same time they asserted the unwelcome doctrine that a British  subject could not at will throw off his allegiance, and that, go where  they might, the wandering farmers were still only the pioneers of  British colonies. To emphasise the fact three companies of soldiers  were sent in 1842 to what is now Durban--the usual Corporal's guard with  which Great Britain starts a new empire. This handful of men was waylaid  by the Boers and cut up, as their successors have been so often since.  The survivors, however, fortified themselves, and held a defensive  position--as also their successors have done so many times since--until  reinforcements arrived and the farmers dispersed. It is singular how in  history the same factors will always give the same result. Here in this  first skirmish is an epitome of all our military relations with these  people. The blundering headstrong attack, the defeat, the powerlessness  of the farmer against the weakest fortifications--it is the same tale  over and over again in different scales of importance. Natal from this  time onward became a British colony, and the majority of the Boers  trekked north and east with bitter hearts to tell their wrongs to their  brethren of the Orange Free State and of the Transvaal.    Had they any wrongs to tell? It is difficult to reach that height of  philosophic detachment which enables the historian to deal absolutely  impartially where his own country is a party to the quarrel. But  at least we may allow that there is a case for our adversary. Our  annexation of Natal had been by no means definite, and it was they and  not we who first broke that bloodthirsty Zulu power which threw its  shadow across the country. It was hard after such trials and such  exploits to turn their back upon the fertile land which they had  conquered, and to return to the bare pastures of the upland veld. They  carried out of Natal a heavy sense of injury, which has helped to  poison our relations with them ever since. It was, in a way, a momentous  episode, this little skirmish of soldiers and emigrants, for it was the  heading off of the Boer from the sea and the confinement of his ambition  to the land. Had it gone the other way, a new and possibly formidable  flag would have been added to the maritime nations.    The emigrants who had settled in the huge tract of country between  the Orange River in the south and the Limpopo in the north had been  recruited by newcomers from the Cape Colony until they numbered some  fifteen thousand souls. This population was scattered over a space  as large as Germany, and larger than Pennsylvania, New York, and New  England. Their form of government was individualistic and democratic to  the last degree compatible with any sort of cohesion. Their wars with  the Kaffirs and their fear and dislike of the British Government appear  to have been the only ties which held them together. They divided  and subdivided within their own borders, like a germinating egg.  The Transvaal was full of lusty little high-mettled communities,  who quarreled among themselves as fiercely as they had done with the  authorities at the Cape. Lydenburg, Zoutpansberg, and Potchefstroom were  on the point of turning their rifles against each other. In the south,  between the Orange River and the Vaal, there was no form of government  at all, but a welter of Dutch farmers, Basutos, Hottentots, and  halfbreeds living in a chronic state of turbulence, recognising neither  the British authority to the south of them nor the Transvaal republics  to the north. The chaos became at last unendurable, and in 1848 a  garrison was placed in Bloemfontein and the district incorporated in the  British Empire. The emigrants made a futile resistance at Boomplaats,  and after a single defeat allowed themselves to be drawn into the  settled order of civilised rule.    At this period the Transvaal, where most of the Boers had settled,  desired a formal acknowledgment of their independence, which the British  authorities determined once and for all to give them. The great barren  country, which produced little save marksmen, had no attractions for a  Colonial Office which was bent upon the limitation of its liabilities.  A Convention was concluded between the two parties, known as the Sand  River Convention, which is one of the fixed points in South African  history. By it the British Government guaranteed to the Boer farmers the  right to manage their own affairs, and to govern themselves by their  own laws without any interference upon the part of the British. It  stipulated that there should be no slavery, and with that single  reservation washed its hands finally, as it imagined, of the whole  question. So the South African Republic came formally into existence.    In the very year after the Sand River Convention a second republic, the  Orange Free State, was created by the deliberate withdrawal of Great  Britain from the territory which she had for eight years occupied. The  Eastern Question was already becoming acute, and the cloud of a great  war was drifting up, visible to all men. British statesmen felt that  their commitments were very heavy in every part of the world, and  the South African annexations had always been a doubtful value and an  undoubted trouble. Against the will of a large part of the inhabitants,  whether a majority or not it is impossible to say, we withdrew our  troops as amicably as the Romans withdrew from Britain, and the new  republic was left with absolute and unfettered independence. On a  petition being presented against the withdrawal, the Home Government  actually voted forty-eight thousand pounds to compensate those who had  suffered from the change. Whatever historical grievance the Transvaal  may have against Great Britain, we can at least, save perhaps in one  matter, claim to have a very clear conscience concerning our dealings  with the Orange Free State. Thus in 1852 and in 1854 were born those  sturdy States who were able for a time to hold at bay the united forces  of the empire.    In the meantime Cape Colony, in spite of these secessions, had prospered  exceedingly, and her population--English, German, and Dutch--had grown  by 1870 to over two hundred thousand souls, the Dutch still slightly  predominating. According to the Liberal colonial policy of Great  Britain, the time had come to cut the cord and let the young nation  conduct its own affairs. In 1872 complete self-government was given  to it, the Governor, as the representative of the Queen, retaining a  nominal unexercised veto upon legislation. According to this system  the Dutch majority of the colony could, and did, put their own  representatives into power and run the government upon Dutch lines.  Already Dutch law had been restored, and Dutch put on the same footing  as English as the official language of the country. The extreme  liberality of such measures, and the uncompromising way in which they  have been carried out, however distasteful the legislation might seem  to English ideas, are among the chief reasons which made the illiberal  treatment of British settlers in the Transvaal so keenly resented at the  Cape. A Dutch Government was ruling the British in a British colony,  at a moment when the Boers would not give an Englishman a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#3)"],[1,"ink. \"But do you  mean to say that you and I are no more than a mosquito, a malaria  protozoan, or even one of those trees in the jungle?\"    Sir Basil's dry skin slipped back into a long smile. \"Startling,  isn't it? You, I, and all other living organisms are nothing but  matter, energy and consciousness. You and I have a larger share of  consciousness, because our organic structure permits the mind-electrons  greater freedom over the matter than composes our bodies. We are more  acutely aware of the universe about us, have a greater facility for  enjoyment and suffering, a more intricate brain and nervous system.  Yet when our bodies die and our consciousness is released, the  mind-electrons enslaved by our atoms go back to the elemental Whole.  This holds good for the protozoan, the tree, the man--for all things  that live.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hale was drinking again. \"You mean, Sir Basil, that there is a sort of  war waged against what you personify as the Mind by matter; that matter  is constantly seeking to enslave mind-electrons, so that it may become  an organism which, for awhile, may enjoy what we call life?\"    Sir Basil pushed back his tufted hair and looked happy. \"Yes! And it's  Nature's supreme blunder! In the end, the Mind always conquers and gains  its release, yet the eternal chain of enslavement goes on and on, and  will continue to go on as long as there is a living organism in the  world to bind mind to matter.\"    Hale was excited now, as much from the fiery intoxicant as from the  scientist's weird revelation. \"I get you,\" he said, rather inelegantly  for a professor. \"You mean that if every living thing in the world  should pass out, every man, every plant, every animal, even down to  microscopic infusoria, the Mind would collect all its electrons, and  through some more jealous law of, er, cohesion hold these electrons  inviolate from matter and energy?\"    \"Right! And again, as in the beginning, the Mind would rule supreme. By  what I have proved, you and I and all other creatures that now have life  may, as separate unfleshed electrons, enjoy eternal consciousness as a  part of the Mind.\" A new passion leaped to his dark eyes. \"When I have  finished my mission, no more need we be slaves of the dust, subject to  all the frightful sufferings of this dunghill of flesh.\"    He brought his fist down upon his skinny leg with a resounding blow.    \"But you cannot reduce your theory to fact, Sir Basil!\"    \"No?\" Again came that frightful grin to his cadaverous face. \"Can you  withstand shock?\"    \"If you mean shock to the eye, let me remind you that I served two years  in the big fight.\"    \"Then come to my laboratory. Better take another drink.\"    While Hale helped himself again from the _masata_ bottle, Sir Basil  swallowed another pellet.    Then the two went into the adjoining apartment.           *       *       *       *       *    Sir Basil, his hand over the doorknob, paused.    \"Before we go in,\" he said, \"I want you to remember that we call natural  that which is characteristic of the physical world. Everything alive in  this laboratory was produced by nature. I merely made available the  materials, or, rather, I made the conditions under which matter was able  to enslave mind-electrons.\"    He opened the door, slipped his body through, and, with his ugly,  teeth-revealing grin, gestured for Hale to follow him.    Hale steeled himself and looked around half fearfully. The first glance  took in a large and well-equipped laboratory, somewhat fetid with animal  odors. The second lingered here and there on cages, aquariums,  incubators, and other containers where creatures moved.    Suddenly, as something scuttled across the floor and disappeared into a  hole in the wall, Hale cried out and covered his eyes with a hand.    Sir Basil laughed aloud. \"Why didn't you examine it closer?\"    Hale looked nauseated. \"My God, Sir Basil! A rat with a man's head and  face!\"    Sir Basil's voice was sharp, decisive. \"Before you leave this  laboratory, you're going to come out of your foolish belief that man is  a creature apart from other living organisms. You--the conscious you--is  no greater, no more important in the final balance than the spark of  consciousness in that rat. When your body and the rat's body give up  their atoms to nature's laboratory, the little enslaved mind-electron  that is you and the one that is the rat will be identical.\"    Again Hale shivered and turned away from that cold, too-thin face.    The scientist was speaking. \"Step around to all those cages and pens. I  want you to see all my slaves of the dust.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But long before Hale had encircled the room, he was so disturbed at what  he saw that he could scarcely complete his frightful inspection. In  every enclosure he viewed a monstrosity that in some way resembled a  human. Every reptile, every insect, every queer, misshapen animal not  only looked human in some shocking manner, but also seemed to possess  human characteristics. It seemed as though some demented creator with a  perverted sense of humor had attempted to mock man by calling forth  monsters in his image.    At last the young man cried out: \"How did you breed these freaks?\"    \"They are not freaks, and I did not breed them. They are nature's  parentless products whose basic elements were brought together in  this laboratory, and, by a scientific reproduction of the functions  of creation, endowed with the life principle, which is merely  mind-electrons.\" He smoothed his long tuft of hair nervously. \"Would  you like to see how life springs from a wedding of matter, energy,  and consciousness?\"    \"I suspect I can stand anything now,\" Hale admitted.    \"Then come and peep into a very remarkable group of apparatus I have  developed, where you can watch atoms building molecules and molecules  building living organisms.\"    \"You say I can see atoms?\"    \"Not directly, of course. The light waves will forever prevent us from  actually seeing the atom. But I have perfected a system of photography  which magnifies particles smaller than light waves, and, separating  their images from the light waves, renders detail clear in the moving  pictures.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He went to a huge machine or series of machines which took up all the  center floor space of the laboratory, where he busied himself in an  intricate network of wires, mirrors, electrodes, ray projectors, and  traveling metal compartments. Presently he called out to Hale.    \"Let me remind you, Oakham, that while any scientist can break up any of  the various proteid molecules which are the basis of all living cells,  animal and vegetable, no scientist before me has been able to compound  the atoms and build them into a proteid molecule.\"    He bared his teeth in the smile that Hale hated.    \"I am proud to tell you that the proteid molecule can be built up only  when the third element of nature's trinity is added--the mind-electron.  I have found a means of capturing the mind-electron and of bringing it  in contact with proteid elements. And now it is possible to bring forth  life in the laboratory. Come closer and watch proteid forming  protoplasm, protoplasm forming a cell, and the cell evolving into--well,  what do you want, an animal, plant, or an insect?\"    Hale had fallen under the scientist's spell. He did not feel foolish  when he said:    \"Let's have a rat!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hale became so absorbed in the wonders of the laboratory that when lunch  time came, Sir Basil had food brought to them. While they were eating a  very good vegetable stew, farina, and luscious tropical fruits, a  sudden, agonized scream rang out, followed by other screams and wails.    Sir Basil opened the door and looked out. Ana came running forward. Her  blue eyes were flooded with tears.    \"Oh, Aimu!\" she moaned. \"A tree fell on Unani Assu.\"    She buried her beautiful face in her hands and sobbed aloud.    Sir Basil frowned heavily.    \"I can't lose Unani Assu yet,\" he declared. \"He is a wonderful help  around the laboratory. Is he dead?\"    \"No. We should rejoice if his time of release had come. But his legs,  Aimu! No one wants to suffer and be crippled.\"    Even in her distress, the girl's voice was rich and vibrant, and every  tone moved Hale curiously.    \"Hurry!\" cried the scientist. \"Have them bring him here before he  dies.\"    The girl leaped to her feet and sped away.    \"Come, Oakham,\" continued Sir Basil. \"Here is a rare opportunity for you  to see how completely I have mastered the laws that govern organic  matter. Help me prepare.\"           *       *       *       *       *    For several minutes, Hale worked under the scientist's sharply spoken  directions. By the time the injured man was brought to the laboratory,  Sir Basil was ready for him.    Unani Assu was still conscious, but his pale face indicated that he had  lost much blood. When the improvised stretcher was lowered to the floor,  Sir Basil sent all the Indians away.    Unani Assu opened his eyes and called feebly, \"Ana!\"    \"Be still!\" ordered Sir Basil. \"Ana is not here.\"    \"Please!\" gasped the dying man. \"I want her--my Ana!\"    Sir Basil sucked in his breath sharply. \"What's this? Have you been  making love to Ana again, after my warning to you?\"    The sufferer stirred uneasily. \"No!\" he panted. \"But perhaps my hour of  release has come, and I want to look at her--once more.\"    The scientist smiled unpleasantly as he eyed the magnificent body which  looked like a broken statue in bronze.    \"Some human characteristics are strange,\" he muttered. \"In spite of  everything I do, this fellow continues to love Ana: Ana whom I intend  for myself.\"    He stepped to the apparatus and swiftly changed one of the adjustments.    \"Perhaps,\" he resumed, with a gleam in his eyes that chilled Hale, \"this  will"]]]
