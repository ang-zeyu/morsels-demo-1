I kin remember de biscuit. I  never hunted any, but I went bird blindin' an' set bird traps. I caught  lots o' birds.    \"Jack Johnson, my marster never had no children of his own. He had a  boy with him by the name of Stephen, a nephew of his, from one of his  brothers. Marster Jack had three brothers Willis, Billy, and Matthew. I  don' remember any of his sisters. There was 'bout four thousand acres  in de plantation an' 'bout 25 slaves. Marster would not have an  overseer.    \"No sir, de slaves worked very much as they pleased. He whupped a slave  now an' then, but not much. I have seen him whup 'em. He had some  unruly niggers. Some of 'em were part Indian, an' mean. Dey all loved  him doe. I never saw a slave sold. He kept his slaves together. He  didn't want to git rid of any of 'em. We went to de white folks church  at Neill's Creek a missionary Baptis' Church.    \"We played during the Christmas holidays, an' we got 'bout two weeks  4th of July, and lay by time, which wus 'bout the fourth. We had great  times at corn shuckin's, log rollin's and cotton pickin's. We had  dances. Marster lowed his slaves lots o' freedom. My mother used to say  he wus better den other folks. Yes, she said her marster wus better  than other folks.    \"The white folks didn't teach us to read an' write. I cannot read an'  write, but de white folks, only 'bout half or less den half, could read  an' write den. Dere were very few pore white folks who could read an'  write. I remember de baptizin's at de Reuben Matthews Mill Pond.  Sometimes after a big meeting dey would baptize twenty four at one  time. No slaves run away from Marster. Dey didn't have any scuse to do  so, cause whites and colored fared alike at Marster's. We played base,  cat, rolly hole, and a kind of base ball called 'round town.    \"Dr. John McNeill looked after us when we were sick. We used a lot of  herbs an' things. Drank sassafras tea an' mullen tea. We also used  sheep tea for measles, you knows dat. You know how it wus made. Called  sheep pill tea. It shore would cuore de measles. 'Bout all dat would  cuore measles den. Dey were bad den. Wus den dey is now.    \"I saw Wheeler's Cavalry. Dey come through ahead of de Yankees. I saw  colored people in de Yankee uniforms. Dey wore blue and had brass  buttons on 'em. De Yankees an' Wheeler's Cavalry took everything dey  wanted, meat, chickens, an' stock. We stayed on wid Marster after de  war. I've never lived out of de state. We lived in de same place ontill  old Marster an' Missus died. Den we lived wid deir relations right on  an' here. I am now on a place deir heirs own.    \"Ole Marster loved his dram, an' he gave it to all his slaves. It sold  for ten cents a quart. He made brandy by de barrels, an' at holidays  all drank together an' had a good time. I never saw any of 'em drunk.  People wan't mean when dey were drinking den. It wus so plentiful  nobody notices it much. Marster would tell de children 'bout Raw Head  and Bloody Bones an' other things to skeer us. He would call us to de  barn to git apples an' run an' hide, an' we would have a time findin'  him. He give de one who found him a apple. Sometimes he didn't give de  others no apple.    \"I married Ellen Johnson May 22, 1865 de year de war went up, an' my  wife is livin' as you see, an' able to be about.

Beginning from Jerusalem.      --_Acts._      A commercial message of trifling import may now be flashed in a few  minutes from Jerusalem to the Antipodes: the message of Christ's love  took nearly eighteen centuries to make the journey. For a time, indeed,  the advance was direct and swift, for before the third century after  Christ a Church had established itself in South India. But there the  missionary impulse failed. Had the first rate of progress been  maintained, the message would have reached our shores a whole millennium  before it actually arrived.    But what would have been then its form and content? Had it made its way  from island to island, passing through the minds of Malay, Papuan, or  Melanesian on its passage, how much of its original purity would have  been preserved? And who would have been here to receive it? Possibly,  only the moa and the apteryx. Who knows?    These considerations enable us to look with less regret upon the check  which the Christian message received after its first rapid advance. The  rise of Mohammedanism in the sixth century drove the faith of Christ  from Asia and from Africa, but it kept it \"white.\" It threw a barrier  across the old road which led from Jerusalem to the Antipodes, but the  barrier enabled preparation to be made on either side for a grander and  more fruitful intercourse. On the south of the Islamic empire the  migrations of the peoples brought to our islands the Maori race, who  made them their permanent home. On the north, the Christian faith took  firm hold of the maritime nations of Europe, from whom the missionaries  of the future were to spring.    The capture of Constantinople by the"]]]
