Among carnivores this included some canids, ursids, mustelids, and  felids (Darlington, 1963:393-395, 397; Webb, 1985a). Procyonids,  however, did not cross the Bering land bridge into Asia, and Ewer  (1973:369) ascribes this to their being an \"essentially tropical  group.\" Miocene radiation of procyonids occurred at a time when two of  the four major climatic deteriorations (middle and late Miocene) were  taking place (Webb, 1985a, 1985b). These deteriorations had the effect  of cooling the middle latitudes to the extent that temperate forest  forms began to appear in mid-latitude floras, along with a rapid  influx of herbaceous plants (Barghoorn, 1953). The procyonid radiation  did not penetrate beyond these climatically changing middle latitudes,  which implies that these animals were \"warm-adapted,\" and were,  therefore, physiologically excluded from reaching the Bering land  bridge. Today, three of the six genera and over half of the 18 species  that comprise Procyonidae (Table 1; Wozencraft, 1989b) remain confined  to tropical regions of North and South America (Hall and Kelson,  1959:878-897; Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975; Kortlucke and Ramirez-Pulido,  1982; Nowak and Paradiso, 1983:977-985).      _Typical Procyonids_    McNab (1988a) contends that basal metabolism is a highly plastic  character in evolution, and he has amply shown that ecologically  uniform species are more apt to share common metabolic rates than  taxonomically allied species from drastically different environments  (McNab, 1984a, 1986a, 1986b, 1988a). Procyonids represent a  taxonomically allied group that shared a common ecological situation  for millions of years; consequently, members of this family might be  expected to show some uniformity in their [.H]_{b}. Basal and  thermoregulatory metabolism of several procyonids have been measured:  kinkajou, _Potos flavus_ (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; McNab, 1978a;  Mueller and Rost, 1983), coatis, _Nasua nasua_ (Chevillard-Hugot et  al., 1980; Mugaas et al., in prep.), and _Nasua narica_ (Scholander et  al., 1950c; Mugaas et al., in prep.), ringtail, _Bassariscus astutus_  (Chevalier, 1985), and crab-eating raccoon, _Procyon cancrivorus_  (Scholander et al., 1950c). In general, these species have [.H]_{b}'s  that are 40%-80% of the values predicted for them by the Kleiber  (1961:206) equation. Lower than predicted [.H]_{b} is viewed as an  energy-saving adaptation for procyonids living in relatively stable  tropical climates (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Chevillard-Hugot et al.,  1980; Mueller and Rost, 1983). This implies that lower than predicted  [.H]_{b} is a general procyonid condition and that it represents a  characteristic that evolved in response to the family's long  association with tropical and subtropical forest environments.      _The Atypical Procyonid_    Although most procyonids are found in only tropical to subtropical  climates, the North American raccoon, _Procyon lotor_, (Figure 1) has  a much broader distribution that extends from tropical Panama (8 deg.N) to  southern Canada. In Alberta, Canada, its range reaches the edge of the  Hudsonian Life Zone at 60 deg.N (for distribution maps see Hall and  Kelson, 1959:878-897, and Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975). Range extensions  and an increase in numbers have been noted in Canada and in parts of  the United States since the 19th century (Lotze and Anderson, 1979;  Kaufmann, 1982; Nowak and Paradiso, 1983:977-985). Thus, _Procyon  lotor_ is more complex ecologically than other procyonids,  particularly when one takes into account its highly generalized food  habits (Hamilton, 1936; Stuewer, 1943; Stains, 1956:39-51; Greenwood,  1981) and the wide range of habitat types (forest, prairie, desert,  mountain, coastal marsh, freshwater marsh) and climates (tropical to  north temperate) in which it is successful (Whitney and Underwood,  1952:1; Hall and Kelson, 1959:885; Lotze and Anderson, 1979;  Kaufmann, 1982). On this basis it is clear that _Procyon lotor_ has  deviated from the typical procyonid portrait and has become the  consummate generalist of the Procyonidae.      [Illustration: FIGURE 1.--North American raccoon, _Procyon lotor_.]      _The Hypothesis_    Our general hypothesis was that whereas most contemporary procyonids  have retained the metabolic characteristics of their warm-adapted  ancestors, _Procyon lotor_ possesses a different set of adaptations,  which either evolved as characteristics unique to this species or were  acquired from its ancestral stock. In either case, its unique  adaptations have given _Procyon lotor_ the physiological flexibility  to generalize its use of habitats and climates and expand its  geographic distribution to a much greater extent than other  procyonids.      _Hypothesis Testing_    We tested our hypothesis by comparing _Procyon lotor_ with several  other procyonids (_Bassariscus astutus_, _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua  narica_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, and _Potos flavus_) on the basis of  their (1) basal metabolic rate ([.H]_{b}), (2) minimum wet thermal  conductance (C_{mw}), (3) diversity of diet (D_{d}), (4) intrinsic  rate of natural increase (r_{max}), and, when data were available, (5)  capacity for evaporative cooling (E_{c}). In a genetic sense each one  of these variables is a complex adaptive characteristic, expression of  which is determined by the interaction of several genes (Prosser,  1986:110-165). Experience has shown that a given species will express  each one of these variables in a specific manner that is relevant to  its mass, physiology, behavior, and environmental circumstance. Thus,  different expressions of these variables may represent specific  climatic adaptations (Prosser, 1986:16) that have been selected-for by  evolutionary process. Because these variables are interrelated with  respect to regulation of body temperature and energy balance, they  have co-evolved in each species to form an adaptive unit. For each  species, measured and calculated values for the first four variables  were converted into dimensionless numbers and used to derive a  composite score that represented its adaptive unit. Climatic  distributions of these species were then compared relative to their  composite scores.        ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VARIABLES      _Basal Metabolic Rate and Intrinsic Rate of Natural Increase_    Basal metabolic rate represents the minimum energy required by an  animal to maintain basic homeostasis (Lusk, 1917:141; Kleiber, 1932,  1961:251; Benedict, 1938; Brody, 1945:59; Robbins, 1983:105-111). For  mammals, [.H]_b appears to be determined by complex interactions  between their body size (Kleiber, 1932, 1961:206; Benedict, 1938;  Brody, 1945:368-374; Hemmingsen, 1960:15-36; McNab, 1983b; Calder,  1987), the climate in which they live (Scholander et al., 1950c; McNab  and Morrison, 1963; Hulbert and Dawson, 1974; Shkolnik and  Schmidt-Nielsen, 1976; McNab, 1979a; Vogel, 1980), their food habits  (McNab, 1978a, 1978b, 1980a, 1983a, 1984a, 1986a, 1986b, 1988a, 1989),  and their circadian period (Aschoff and Pohl, 1970; Prothero, 1984).  Some species have higher mass-specific [.H]_{b} than others, and this  variation appears to be tied to ecological circumstances rather than  taxonomic affinities (McNab, 1988a, 1989). Basal metabolic rate is  important ecologically because it serves as a measure of a species'  minimum \"obligatory\" energy requirement, and under many circumstances,  it represents the largest energy demand associated with a daily energy  budget (King, 1974:38-55; McNab, 1980a; Mugaas and King, 1981:37-40).  Recently it also has been implicated as a permissive factor with  respect to r_{max} of mammals (Hennemann, 1983; Lillegraven et al.,  1987; Nicoll and Thompson, 1987; Thompson, 1987) via its direct effect  on their rates of development and fecundity (McNab, 1980a, 1983a,  1986b; Hennemann, 1983; Schmitz and Lavigne, 1984; Glazier, 1985a,  1985b). The implication of this latter point is that those species  with higher [.H]_{b}'s also have faster rates of development and  greater fecundity and hence enjoy the competitive advantage of a  higher r_{max}. Basal metabolism is, therefore, \"a highly plastic  character in the course of evolution\" (McNab, 1988a:25) that has a  profound influence on each species' life history.      _Minimum Thermal Conductance_    Whole-body resistance to passive heat transfer is equal to tissue  resistance plus coat resistance. Within limits, these resistances can  be altered; tissue resistance can be varied by changes in blood flow,  whereas coat resistance can be changed by piloerection, molt, and  behavior. When whole-body resistance is maximized (maximum tissue and  coat resistances), passive heat transfer is minimized. The inverse of  resistance is conductance; therefore, maximum whole-body resistance is  the inverse of minimum thermal conductance (C_{m}). Minimum thermal  conductance is readily derived from metabolic chamber data, and it is  commonly used to describe an animal's capacity to minimize passive  heat transfer. Minimum thermal conductance interacts with [.H]_{b} and  body mass to set the maximum temperature differential a mammal can  maintain without increasing its basal level of heat production. The  low temperature in this differential is the lower critical temperature  (T_{lc}).    Mass-specific C_{m} for mammals is negatively correlated with body  mass (McNab and Morrison, 1963; Herreid and Kessel, 1967; McNab, 1970,  1979b; Bradley and Deavers, 1980; Aschoff, 1981), and for any given  mass its magnitude is 52% higher during the active, rather than the  inactive, phase of the daily cycle (Aschoff, 1981). However, some  mammals have C_{m}'s that are higher or lower than would be predicted  for them on the basis of body mass and circadian phase.

Their means of subsistence and travel were the simplest imaginable, two  canoes and as large quantities of smoked meat and Indian corn as could  be conveniently carried. Their canoes were of the usual Canadian  pattern, of birch-bark covering, stayed with spruce-root ribs and  cedar-splint, with white-pine pitch smeared over the birch-bark joints  so as to render them water-tight. Such canoes were of astonishing  strength and carrying capacity, and of such lightness that four men  could carry the largest across portages.    On a bright spring morning, May 17th, Joliet and Marquette, with five  other men, left behind them the palisaded post and chapel of St. Ignace.  Plying briskly their paddles from sunrise to sunset, they made rapid  progress, coasting the lake shore until they turned aside to visit the  Menominees, or Wild-rice Indians, whose village was on the river of that  same name. Here inquiries for information of the \"great river\" brought  from the savage allies strenuous efforts to dissuade them from visiting  this Mississippi, where, they said, the unsparing ferocity of the tribes  brought unfailing death by the tomahawk to even inoffensive strangers,  and that war now raged among the intervening nations. They further  recited the dangers of navigating the rapids of the Great River, the  presence of frightful water monsters who swallowed up men and canoes,  the roaring demon who engulfed all travellers, and lastly the existence  of such excessive heat as to ensure certain death. After religious  instruction and service the explorers embarked in their canoes and soon  reached the southern extremity of Green Bay, where, says Marquette, \"our  fathers labor successfully in the conversion of these tribes, having  baptized more than 2,000.\"    Joliet from Green Bay entered Fox River, finding it a gentle, beautiful  stream, promising easy and pleasant passage and abounding in wildfowl.  Soon, however, these agreeable aspects gave way to the sterner phases of  exploration, for sharp rapids were fallen in with where the strong and  uncertain cross-currents often threatened the total destruction of their  frail canoes, which would have proved fatal to their plans, by dashing  them against the sharp bowlders.    A serious but lesser evil to these enduring voyagers was the injury to  their mocassin-shod feet, which were cut and bruised by the sharp edges  of the rocky bed of the river over which they slowly and painfully  dragged their canoes for long distances.    The many rapids were safely passed, and on the 7th of June, 1673, our  explorers reached an Indian town which marked the extreme western limits  of French discoveries, being the farthest point reached by Nicollet in  his adventurous journey.    In this town dwelt bands from three different tribes, the Miamis,  Maskoutens, or Fire Nation, and Kickapoos. The latter two were inferior  in manners and appearance to the Miamis, who, more civil, liberal, and  well-made, wore two long ear-locks that Marquette thought becoming;  besides they were reputed warriors, who rarely failed in their forays.  They proved docile, attentive, and interested in religious matters, as  was shown not only by their talk with Father Allouez, but also by a  cross standing in the centre of the town, which was adorned with votive  offerings of skins, belts, bows and arrows to the Great Manitou for an  abundance of game during the dreaded famine time of winter.    The Indians used for their beds mats, probably made of rushes, which in  default of bark also served as material for the walls and roofs of  their unsubstantial shelters. Since Marquette refers to the advantage of  such building material as capable of being rolled up and easily moved  during hunts, it is probable that this town was of a temporary  character. It appears to have been well located, being on an eminence,  whence the approach of an enemy or the presence of game could be readily  observed in the open country. Marquette says of it: \"The view is  beautiful and very picturesque, for from the eminence on which it is  perched are seen stretching out on every side, as far as eye can reach,  prairies broken by thickets or groves of lofty trees.\" The Indians grew  much corn, and gathered wild plums and \"grapes, from which,\" his  thoughts turning to home, he says, \"good wine could be made if they  chose.\"    Joliet lost no time, but immediately on arrival assembled the sachems  and told them that he was sent by his Governor to discover new  countries. He made them a present and asked that two guides be sent to  show him the way, which resulted in the gift to Joliet of a mat to serve  as a bed, and the sending of two Miamis as guides.    The next day, June 10th, they proceeded, two Miamis and seven Frenchmen  in two canoes, up the river to the portage, through a net-work of  marshes, little lakes, and meandering channels so hidden by the wild  rice that their guides were very useful. Conducting Joliet to a portage  of 2,700 paces, and assisting in the transportation of the canoes across  it, the Miamis then returned, leaving the explorers \"alone in an  unknown country, in the hands of Providence.\"    Before launching their canoes into strange waters, which were to bear  them into unknown lands, they knelt on the bank and offered up devout  aspirations to God for continued success. The new river was the  Weskousing (Wisconsin), whose broad shallows and sandy bottom, while  rendering navigation slow and very laborious, yet contrasted  delightfully with the rocky rapids of the Fox.    Father Marquette sets forth delightfully the ideal voyage down this  stream, past vine-clad islets, along sloping banks, now bordered by the  lovely prairie, with its sweet odors of fresh grasses and blooming  flowers, and anon fringed by the primeval forest, beautiful with its  tangle of shrubbery and in its June foliage. The gnarled oak, the  straight walnut, the elegant whitewood, and other stately trees of  unknown species met their vision at times, while again their eyes  scarcely separated from the heavens the distant horizon of the green  level plains, whose luxuriant vegetation afforded the richest pasturage  for numerous herds of deer and moose, and in spots showed the fertility  of its alluvial soil by the fields of Indian corn.    Each morning, before they relaunched their canoes, they attuned their  voices to the praise of God, and, in their unique joy of successful  discovery, must have felt on those delightful June days that their  devotions had not been uplifted in vain. From sunrise to sunset they  labored unceasingly, now paddling briskly along the deep reaches, and  then struggling stoutly through mazes of shallows and sand-bars, where  tedious and frequent portages were patiently made.    Each evening their hearts rejoiced and their tired limbs found  delightful repose at some spot where Joliet's judgment directed the  canoes to be drawn out, inspected, and upturned by some, while others  started the camp-fire and prepared the evening meal. This camp was  always so placed that the approach of an enemy could be seen from afar,  and where fuel for fire and branches for bedding were at hand. The best  hunter was told off for game, and rarely did the meal lack fresh meat or  fruit and berries in season. After supper the soothing pipe, prayers and  songs of praise, and then under the over-arching trees such sound  slumber as only comes to men sleeping under the open sky.    As they advanced it was often possible to use sail and relieve the men  to some extent from the fatigue of the paddle, and such rapid progress  was made that, on June 17th, they safely entered the long-desired  Mississippi, \"with a joy,\" writes Marquette, \"which I cannot express.\"  They were then in latitude 43 deg. 03' N., opposite the site of the present  city of Prairie du Chien.    Turning eagerly southward, their progress facilitated by the gentle  current of the Mississippi, they journeyed more than a hundred leagues  without seeing on the land aught save birds and beasts. The solitude of  the great river appalled them: a vast torrent of rolling water,  bordered by forest and plain, so well fitted for the happiness of man,  and yet no human being in all this land! What could it mean, and what  would be the outcome? Joliet, of long experience with savage tribes, and  astute in forest craft, distrusted the silence and solitude, and kept as  keen guard as though on the war-path. A tiny camp-fire was built only  for meals, and the nights were passed in the crowded canoes as far from  shore as it was possible to anchor them in the deep river. Even then  strict watch was kept, and every strange or unusual noise excited  feelings of trepidation lest a hidden foe be the cause.    Their journey by day was not entirely devoid of incident and excitement,  says Marquette. \"From time to time we met monstrous fishes, one of which  struck the canoe so violently I took it for a large tree. Another time  we perceived on the water a monster [probably an American tiger-cat]  with a head like a tiger and a pointed snout like the wild-cat, with  beard and ears erect, a grayish head, and entirely black neck.\" They  cast their nets successfully, and once caught a spade-fish, whose  appearance caused much astonishment. In 41 deg. 28' N. latitude (near Rock  Island), wild turkeys took the place of wild fowl; while as to animals,  only buffalo were seen, being so numerous and fearless as to be easily  killed, and thus offering a welcome change of food. These new beasts  presented themselves to our explorers as hideous, especially those with  thick, long manes falling over their eyes in such tangles as to prevent  their seeing clearly. Marquette records that the Indians tan  buffalo-skins into beautiful robes, which they"]]]
