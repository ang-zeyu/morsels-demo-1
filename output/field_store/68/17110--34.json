In a few seconds the small particles of the substance will have  dissolved, and the bead will be seen to have assumed the color  characteristic of the substance. Note the color when hot and then when  cold; often there is a wide difference. Then, too, the test should be  made in both O. F. and R. F.    Some analysts prefer to make a small loop in the end of the wire before  taking up the borax to make the bead. Care should be taken to see that  the bead is colorless before bringing it in contact with the substance.    As the depth of color produced is largely dependent upon the amount of  substance taken, some little caution should be exercised to insure  taking up about the same quantity each time.    _Illustrations._ Make several beads, and note the colors characteristic  of the following oxides: cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese, chromium, and  copper.    The microcosmic salt bead dissolves almost every oxide except silica,  SiO_{2}, and this is seen to float about in the melted mass. This is  used as a test for silica.      ~Examination with Co(NO_{3})_{2}.~--If after examination on the Ch. _per  se_, a white infusible residue remains, it is moistened with a drop of  cobalt nitrate Co(NO_{3})_{2} and re-ignited before the Bp., when a  change of color will be observed. This change in color is owing to the  fact that the heat of the Bp. flame decomposes the cobalt nitrate,  nitric acid being driven off, and the remaining CoO forming with the  oxide of the residue a colored mass.    _Illustrations._ Ignite before the Bp. on Ch. the following  oxides,--allow to cool, add a drop of Co(NO_{3})_{2}, re-ignite, and  note color,--aluminum, magnesium, zinc, and calcium.    Care should be taken to thoroughly ignite before adding the cobalt  nitrate solution.    With the six methods of examination just given almost every simple  substance can be detected, but should any doubt remain, a few simple  tests in the \"liquid way\" will be sufficient to substantiate the  blowpipe examination.          CHAPTER III    GENERAL REACTIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF THE METALLIC ELEMENTS IN SIMPLE  COMPOUNDS      For the sake of convenience, rather than for scientific reasons, the  following compounds have been arranged in alphabetic order. Also the  oxides of the elements have been taken, since they exhibit the reactions  to best advantage.    The student should work through carefully each one of the tests and  satisfy himself as to the characteristic reactions of the various  elements, for only in this way can he expect to recognize the substances  when presented to him as \"unknowns.\" It is advisable to provide a  note-book and rule it as follows:--    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                           BEHAVIOR OF SUBSTANCE                              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  Before Bp.| Before Bp.  | In ignition | In flame| In flame  | After first   |  on Ch.    | on Ch. with | tube with   |   on    | with borax| ignition      |  alone     | Na_{2}CO_{3}| Na_{2}CO_{3}| platinum| bead      | with          |            |             | and Ch.     |  wire   |           | Co(NO_{3})_{2}|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |            |             |             |         |           |               |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  _Remarks_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _             |                                                                              |  _Substance_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      1. ~Aluminum, Al_{2}O_{3}.~--Before the Bp. on Ch.

Sometimes it is quite  easily detached from the cap socket, as in the Lepiota procerus. It may  be hollow or stuffed, solid or fibrillose. It varies in length and  thickness. In some species it is smooth and polished, in others rough  and hairy, reticulated, etc., sometimes tapering, sometimes distinctly  bulbous at the base.    The spores of the species differ in color and are usually globular or  oblong in shape. All of these characteristics assist in determining the  species.      MUSHROOM GILLS.    Mushroom gills, or lamellae, anatomically considered, are composed,  first, of a central portion, a prolongation of the hymenophore or flesh  of the cap, more or less dense, sometimes so thin as to be scarcely  perceptible; second, the hymenium or spore-bearing membrane covering the  surfaces of this prolonged hymenophore. They are vertical, simple,  equal, respectively, or more frequently alternating with shorter gills.  They are often evanescent and putrescent, sometimes liquefying  altogether. Their color is usually different from the upper surface of  the cap, not always similar to that of the spores borne upon them, at  least in youth; with age, however, they usually assume the color of the  mature spore. The change of color of the gills according to the age of  the plant is very important in the study of the Agaricini; it accounts  for the white gills of certain species in youth, the pink in maturity,  and the brown when aged.    The end of the gill nearest the stalk of the plant is termed the  posterior extremity; the opposite end, the anterior extremity. In most  of the Agaricini the gills are unequal. Some extend from the margin to  about half the space between it and the stem; others are still shorter.      THE VOLVA.    The volva is a membrane which envelops the entire plant in embryo,  giving it the appearance of an egg. It originates at the base of the  mushroom and furnishes it, during its foetal life, with the means of  support and nourishment. Its texture is so delicate that it generally  disappears, leaving very little trace of its existence on the adult  plant. In many of the volvate species this organ exists only so long as  they are under ground, and some mycologists restrict the term \"volvati\"  to such only as retain it afterwards. As the young plant expands it  breaks through the top of this volva or wrapper, and, emerging, carries  with it patches of the membrane on the upper surface of the cap. These  are more or less prominent, numerous, and thick, sometimes irregularly  disposed, sometimes regularly in the form of plates, warts, etc. At the  base of the stem of the mushroom the remains of the volva are seen in  the form of a sort of wrapper. This is more or less ample, thick, and  ascending. It is called _free_ when it is loose or easily detached from  the stem, and _congenital_ when it cannot be separated from it without  laceration. In some species it is distinctly membranous, and in others  floccose, and friable in character, sometimes appearing in ridges as a  mere border, at others broken up into scales, and, as the plant matures,  wholly disappearing. The volva is a feature of great importance in the  study of the Agaricini, of the subgenera Amanita, Volvaria, etc.      THE MUSHROOM VEIL.    The veil is not a constant feature in the Agaricini, at least it is not  always visible. When present it consists of a membrane which extends  from the margin of the cap to the stem, veiling or protecting the gills.  This membrane, called the cortina, has given its name to a numerous and  important class of mushrooms (the _Cortinarias_). It is generally  white, soft, slightly spongy, cottony, at times fibrillose or even  slightly fibrous, again in texture comparable to the spider's web, and  may be even powdery or glutinous. It exists intact only in the youth of  the plant. It is not visible in the developing mushroom, at least while  the cap is closely pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands the  membrane extends and finally breaks, leaving in some species its  remnants upon the margin of the cap and upon the stem in the usual form  of a ring or a mere zone. When the stem is not ringed the veil rises  high upon the stalk, stretches across to meet the edges of the cap, and  is afterwards reflected back over its whole surface.      MUSHROOM SPORES AND MYCELIUM.    The spore is the reproductive organ of the mushroom. It differs from the  seed of the flowering plant in being destitute of an apparent embryo. A  seed contains a plantlet which develops as such. A spore is a minute  cell containing a nucleus or living germ, the reproductive cell germ  called by some authors the germinating granule. This in turn throws out  a highly elongated process consisting of a series of thread-like cells  branching longitudinally and laterally, at length bifurcating and  anastomosing the mass, forming the vegetative process known as mycelium  or mushroom spawn.    On this mycelium, at intervals, appear knob-like bodies, called  tubercles, from which the mushrooms spring and from which they derive  their nourishment. See Fig. 5, Plate A.    Where the conditions have been unfavorable this mycelium has been known  to grow for years without bearing fruit.    Mushroom spores are very variable in size, shape, and color, but are  generally constant at maturity in the same genus. Their shape, almost  always spherical in the young plant, becomes ovate, ellipsoidal,  fusiform, reniform, smooth, stellate, sometimes tuberculate, or remains  globose. This feature, varying thus with the age of the plant, should be  studied in the mature plant.      MYCELIUM.    De Leveille has thus defined mycelium: \"Filaments at first simple, then  more or less complicated, resulting from the vegetation of the spores  and serving as roots to the mushroom.\"    The mycelium of mushrooms or the mushroom spawn is usually white, but is  also found yellow, and even red. It is distinguished by some writers as  nematoid, fibrous, hymenoid, scleroid or tuberculous, and malacoid. The  nematoid mycelium is the most common. Creeping along on the surface of  the earth, penetrating it to a greater or less depth, developing in  manure among the debris of leaves or decayed branches, always protected  from the light, it presently consists of very delicate filamentous cells  more or less loosely interwoven, divided, anastomosing in every  direction and often of considerable extent.    Its presence is sometimes difficult to detect without the use of the  microscope, either on account of its delicacy or because of its being  intermingled with the organic tissues in which it has developed.    Sometimes mycelium unites in bundles more or less thick and branched.  This has been called the fibrous mycelium. Where the filaments  intercross closely, are felted, and inclined to form a membrane, it is  hymenoid mycelium. Where the filaments are so small and close that they  form very compact bodies, constituting those solid irregular products  called sclerotium, it is scleroid or tuberculous mycelium. With malacoid  mycelium we have nothing to do in this paper. It is a soft, pulpy,  fleshy mycelium.    Systematists have divided the Agaricini into groups according to the  color of their spores. These groups are defined as follows by various  authors:        According to--        Elias Fries, 5 groups: _Leucosporus_, white; _Hyporhodius_, pink;      _Cortinaria_, ochraceous; _Derminus_, rust; _Pratella_, purplish      black.
