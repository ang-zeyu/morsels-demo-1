The number  of sticks required to reach the top was six, and as each of these was  about four feet long they knew that, making allowance for the joints,  the snow was over twenty feet deep.    Very often the boys talked of home, and wondered what their friends were  doing.  The first night, when they did not return, it would be hoped  that they had stayed at the farm; but somebody would be sure to go over  in the morning to see, and when the news arrived that they were missing,  there would be a general turn out to find them.    \"They must have given up all hope by this time,\" Dick said, on the fifth  morning, \"and must be pretty sure that we are buried in the drift  somewhere; but, as all the bottoms will be like this, they will have  given up all hopes of finding our bodies till the thaw comes.\"    \"That may be weeks,\" Tom said; \"we might as well have died at once.\"    \"We can live a long time here,\" Dick replied confidently.  \"I remember  reading once of a woman who had been buried in the snow being got out  alive a tremendous time afterwards.  I think it was five weeks, but it  might have been more.  Hurrah!  I have got an idea, Tom.\"    \"What is that?\"  Tom asked.    \"Look here; we will tie three more sticks--\"    \"We can't spare any more sticks,\" Tom said; \"the snow is up to our knees  already.\"    \"Ah! but thin sticks will do for this,\" Dick said; \"we can get some thin  sticks out here.  We will tie them over the others, and on the top of  all we will fasten my red pocket-handkerchief, like a flag; if any one  comes down into this bottom they are sure to see it.\"    CHAPTER TWO.    THE RED FLAG.    Dick's plan was soon carried into effect, and the little red flag flew  as an appeal for help ten feet above the snow in the lonely valley.    Down in Castleton events had turned out just as the boys had  anticipated.  The night of the snow-storm there was no sleep for their  parents, and at daybreak, next morning, Mr Humphreys and Mr Jackson  set out on foot through the storm for the distant farm.  They kept to  the road, but it took them four hours to reach the farm, for the drifts  were many feet deep in the hollows, and they had the greatest difficulty  in making their way through.    When, upon their arrival, they found the boys had left before the gale  began, their consternation and grief were extreme, and they started at  once on their return to Castleton.    Search-parties were immediately organised, and these, in spite of the  fury of the storm, searched the hills in all directions.    After the first day, when it was found that they were not at any of the  shepherds' huts scattered among the hills, all hopes of finding them  alive ceased.  So hopeless was it considered, that few parties went out  on the three following days; but on the fifth, when the snow-storm  ceased and the sun shone out, numbers of men again tramped the hills in  the vague hope of finding some sign of the missing boys; they returned  disheartened.  The snow was two feet deep everywhere, twenty in many of  the hollows.    The next day but few went out, for the general feeling was, that the  bodies could not be discovered until the thaw came, and at present it  was freezing sharply.    Among those who still kept up the search were several of the boys'  school-fellows.  They had not been permitted to join while the  snow-storm continued, and were therefore fresh at the work.  A party of  four kept together, struggling through the deep snow-drifts, climbing up  the hills, and enjoying the fun, in spite of the saddening nature of  their errand.    On arriving at the brow of a deep valley five miles from home, they  agreed that they would go no farther, as it was not likely that the  missing boys could have wandered so far from their track.  That they had  in fact done so was due to a sudden change in the direction of the wind;  it had been driving in their faces when they started, and with bent down  heads they had struggled against it, unconscious that it was sharply  changing its direction.    \"Just let us have a look down into the bottom,\" one of the boys said;  \"there may be a shepherd's hut here.\"    Nothing, however, was seen, save a smooth, white surface of snow.    \"What is that?\" one exclaimed suddenly.  \"Look, there is a little red  flag flying down there--come along.\"    The boys rushed down the hill at full speed.    \"Don't all go near the flag,\" one said; \"you may be treading on their  bodies.\"    They arrived within ten yards of the flag, in which they soon recognised  a red pocket-handkerchief.  They were silent now, awestruck at the  thought that their companions were lying dead beneath.    \"Perhaps it is not theirs,\" the eldest of the party said presently.  \"Anyhow I had better take it off and carry it home.\"    Treading cautiously and with a white face, for he feared to feel beneath  his feet one of the bodies of his friends, he stepped, knee-deep in the  snow-drift, to the flag.  He took the little stick in his hand to pluck  it up; he raised it a foot, and then gave a cry of astonishment and  started back.    \"What is the matter?\" the others asked.    \"It was pulled down again,\" he said in awestruck tones.  \"I will swear  it was pulled down again.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!\" one of the others said; \"you are dreaming.\"    \"I am not,\" the first replied positively; \"it was regularly jerked in my  hand.\"    \"Can they be alive down there?\" one suggested.    \"Alive!  How can they be alive after five days, twenty feet deep in the  snow?  Look at the flag!\"    There was no mistake this time; the flag was raised and lowered five or  six times.  The boys took to their heels and ran and gathered in a  cluster fifty yards away on the hill-side.    \"What can it be?\" they asked, looking in each others' pale faces.    The behaviour of the flag seemed to them something supernatural.    \"We had better go back and tell them at home,\" one of them said.    \"We can't do that; no one would believe us.  Look here, you fellows,\"  and he glanced round at the bright sky, \"this is nonsense; the flag  could not wave of itself; there must be somebody alive below; perhaps  there is a shepherd's hut quite covered with the drift, and they have  pushed the flag up through the chimney.\"    The supposition seemed a reasonable one, and a little ashamed of their  panic the group returned towards the flag.  The eldest boy again  approached it.    \"Go carefully, Tomkins, or you may fall right down a chimney.\"    The flag was still continuing its up and down movement; the boy  approached and lay down on the snow close to it; then he took hold of  the stick; he felt a pull, but held fast; then he put his mouth close to  the hole, two or three inches in diameter, through which it passed.    \"Halloa!\" he shouted; \"is any one below?\"    A cry of \"Yes, yes,\" came back in reply.  \"The two Jacksons and  Humphreys.\"    \"Hurrah!\" he shouted at the top of his voice, and his companions,  although they had not heard the answer, joined in the cheer.    \"Are you all right?\" he shouted down again.    \"Yes, but please get help and dig us out.\"    \"All right; I will run all the way back; they will have men here in no  time; good-bye; keep up your spirits.\"    \"They are all there below!\" he shouted to his friends.  \"Come on, you  fellows, there is not a moment to lose.\"    Wild with excitement the boys made their way home; they rushed down the  hill-sides, scrambled through the drifts in the bottoms, in which they  sometimes disappeared altogether, and had to haul each other out,  struggled up the hills, and, panting and breathless, rushed in a body  into Mr Humphreys' farmhouse, that standing nearest to them, on their  way to Castleton.    \"We have found them; we have found them,\" they panted out.  \"They are  all alive.\"    Mrs Humphreys had risen from her seat in a chair by the fire as the  boys entered, and uttering a faint cry fell back insensible.    At this moment the farmer, who had but five minutes before returned,  having been out since daybreak on the hills, hurried into the room; he  was taking off his heavy boots when he heard the rush of feet into the  house.  \"We have found them, sir; they are all alive!\"    \"Thank God! thank God!\" the farmer exclaimed reverently, and then seeing  his wife insensible hurried towards her, uttering a shout for the  servants.  Two women ran in.  \"Look to your mistress,\" he said; \"she has  fainted; the good news has been too much for her--the boys are found  alive.\"    With mingled exclamations of gladness and dismay the servants raised  their mistress.    \"Now, boys, where are they?\"  Mr Humphreys asked.    The lads gave a rapid narrative of what had happened.    \"Under the snow all this time!\" the farmer exclaimed; \"they must be, as  you say, in a hut.  Now, will one of you stay and show me the way back,  and the others go on to Mr Jackson's and other places, and bring a  strong party of men with shovels on after us?\"    The lad who had spoken with the prisoners remained to act as guide, the  others hurried off.    \"Come with me, my boy, into the larder.  There, help yourself; you must  be hungry and tired, and you have got to do it over again.\"    Mr Humphreys then ran into the yard, and bade the four labourers  provide themselves with shovels and prepare to accompany him at once.    He then went back into the parlour.  His wife was just opening her eyes;  for a time she looked confused and bewildered, then suddenly she sat up  and gazed beseechingly at her husband--memory had come back to her.    \"Yes, wife, thanks be to God, it is true--the boys are alive; I am just "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#3)"],[1,"with pleasure, and that  conservatism, opposing the new simply on account of its newness, would  refrain from its usual tactics in a case where there was really nothing  to conserve. But this was not to be, and strange, indeed, it would have  been if the writer had escaped the opposition which is almost invariably  offered to the discoverer. It appears to be one of the laws of human  evolution, wisely designed to prevent precipitate advance, that every  new discovery must run the gauntlet of men whose mission it is to act as  brakes on the wheels of progress. Of the opposition which has been  offered to the strychnine treatment it would, therefore, be folly to  complain, but just cause of complaint is furnished by the unscientific  attitude which was assumed from the very first and has been maintained  throughout by its opponents.    Not a single attempt has been made to disprove the correctness of the  theory on which it is founded, yet to leave this theory unquestioned but  object to the conclusion to which it leads, must strike even the lay  mind as a most illogical proceeding. It is self-evident that, when  strychnine is administered as an antidote to snake-poison, the quantity  of it injected must be in proportion to that of snake-venom present in  the system, and that the doses in which we dispense it in ordinary  practice must be entirely left out of sight. Still, in the face of these  obvious conclusions, we have had veterans, grave and grey, arguing  pompously that the heroic doses advocated by the writer could not be  countenanced, and that even medical men could not be entrusted with the  serious task of administering them. Even as late as the last medical  congress at Sydney this absurd objection to large doses of the antidote  was again brought forward. After quantities averaging from half a grain  to a grain have been injected many times in Australia with continuous  success, after Banerjee has even gone as high as three and four grains  in India without a single failure, and without in one single instance  serious strychnine symptoms being evoked, the writer of the paper on  \"Snakebite and its Cure\" based his principal objection to the treatment  on the alleged ground of there not being sufficient evidence before us  to justify heroic doses and show them to be safe in practice. When  people wilfully shut their eyes against the most conclusive evidence, it  is improbable that any amount of it would satisfy them. Apart, however,  from the fully proven antagonism between the two poisons rendering the  large doses of the antidote, which in all serious cases are  indispensable, perfectly safe, the fear of strychnine is, in itself, a  very strange aberration of judgment on the part of my opponents,  considering how easy it is to counteract any noteworthy excess in its  action, if, perchance, it should occur through unnecessary overdosing,  by appropriate remedies.    All other objections to the treatment require but to be glanced at to  show their absurdity. Certain crude experiments on dogs made many years  ago in India, and put forward as irrefutable at first, have been  abandoned of late, and my learned opponents have now taken up a position  in their stronghold of statistics, supposed to be impregnable, but in  reality only the last refuge of the destitute, a position from which, by  dexterous handling of alleged facts, anything and everything can be  proven, in short, to use a strong expression, not my own, a convenient  and respectable form of lying. By means of these statistics they try to  prove, in the first place, that Australian snake-poison is not at all  the insidious death-dealing agent it is supposed to be, since, according  to statistics, only 126 persons died from it in three colonies within  the last ten years. Further study of these statistics leads them to the  inference that a strong healthy adult will recover from snakebite  _without any treatment_, and thus they finally arrive at the conclusion  aimed at, that persons cured by strychnine injections would probably  have recovered without them. These are the inferences drawn by men, who,  practising in towns, have probably never seen a case of snakebite. How  do they tally with the facts of the case? It is true that the mortality  among those bitten by snakes is small here as compared with India,  though the poison of our snakes, quantity for quantity, has been proven  to be quite as deadly as that of the Indian ones. Our greater immunity  is due to our snakes giving off less poison at a bite, and with their  short and (excepting those of the death adder) merely grooved poison  fangs injecting it very superficially, thus making the process of  elimination of the poison by ligature and incision or excision of the  punctures much more easy and successful. It is to this treatment, which,  as a rule; is immediately adopted in the bush, that our small mortality  is due. Our children are taught it in school, and the most illiterate  bushman knows how to carry it out. Where it is omitted by persons not  knowing that they are bitten until the poison has been absorbed recovery  is as rare as it is with the ox and the horse left to themselves without  any treatment. But it requires a prodigious stretch of the logical  faculty to understand what our small mortality from snakebite has to do  with the intrinsic merits of the strychnine treatment. Even if nobody  died at all its effects in doing away with the misery and suffering,  which, before its introduction, invariably followed snakebite, and often  was never got rid of completely, would still be sufficiently beneficial  to render the senseless opposition to it on the part of a small section  of medical men little short of criminal; for these effects are a matter  of constant observation, and cannot, like the rescues from death, be  called into question.    The statistics brought forward to prove that the treatment has not  reduced the death-rate are also most faulty. Until it is thoroughly  understood and in every instance properly applied it is manifestly  foolish as well as unfair to lay non-success and failures at its door.  When a medical man is called upon to treat a serious case, and instead  of boldly addressing himself to the task of combating the symptoms by  injecting the antidote irrespective of the quantity he may require until  it has conquered the snake-poison, becomes nervous and ceases to inject,  when, after what in ordinary practice would be a dangerous dose, he sees  but little effect, or if from the first he injects small doses at long  intervals, the cause of failure surely lies with him and not with the  antidote, which rarely fails where it is properly applied. The duty of  disseminating a sound knowledge of the principles of the strychnine  treatment unquestionably devolves on our health authorities, who ought,  by this time, to have taken some notice of it. But officialdom remains  obtuse and issues circulars on the treatment of snakebite,  recommending, _inter alia_, the free use of alcohol.    The literature on the subject of snake-poison is very voluminous, but  those who seek for enlightenment in it will be as disappointed as the  writer was after wading through it. The toilers in this barren field of  research were numerous, but with few exceptions, they toiled in vain.  FONTANA may be looked upon as the founder of that hideous  experimentalism by which, in his hands alone, four thousand animals were  tortured to death without a single tangible result except that in his  great work, \"Reserche Fisiche sopra il Veneno della Vipera,\" which he  wrote at the conclusion of his cruel labours, he left us a grotesque  monument of patient, but ill-guided research. Other Italians, following  his method, Redi, Mangili, Metaxa, &c., were equally unsuccessful in  shedding one ray of light on the vexed and obscure problem.    Among the Germans who contributed to the subject may be mentioned:--    WAGNER.--\"Erfahrungen ueber den Biss der gemeinen Otter.\"    PRINZ MAXIMILIAN VON WIEDD.--\"Beitraege zur Geschichte  Brasiliens.\"    LENZ.--\"Schlangenkunde.\"    HEINZEL.--\"Ueber Pelias Berus und Vipera Ammodytes.\"    Among the French:--    SOUBEIRAN.--\"Rapport sur les Viperes de France.\"    BULLET.--\"Etude sur la Mosure de Vipere.\"    British and American Workers are the most numerous. Commencing with the  century we have:--    RUSSELL.--\"An Account of Indian Serpents, collected on the  Coast of Coromandel.\" Later on,    S. WEIR MITCHELL.--\"Researches upon the Venom of the  Rattlesnake.\"    HALFORD--\"On Australian Snakes, and the Intravenous Injection  of Ammonia, in _British Medical Journal_, _Medical Times_, and  _Australian Medical Journal_.\"    JONES.--\"On Trigonocephalus Contortrix.\"    NICHOLSON.--\"On Indian Snakes.\"    SIR JOSEPH FAYRER.--\"The Tanatophidia of India.\" Also,  \"Researches in conjunction with Richards, Brunton and Eward.\"    WALL.--\"On the Difference in the Physiological Effects produced  by the Poison of Indian Venomous Snakes.\" Proc. Royal Soc., 1881, vol.  xxxii., p. 333.    Among those enumerated above Wall is the only one who formulated a  correct and thoroughly scientific theory of the action of snake-poison,  which has since been confirmed by Australian research and by  Feoktistow's elaborate experiments. It is strange that, after finding  the theory that explained all the phenomena, he did not follow it up by  applying the antidote to which his theory should have led him.          SNAKE-POISON AND ITS ACTION.      The poison gland of snakes is the analogue of the parotid gland of  mammals, both in position and structure. Its acini or alveoli are lined  with a layer of secretory, columnar, finely granular cells and arranged  with great regularity along the excretory duct, which is straight and  cylindrical and opens with vipers into the hollow poison fang, with our  colubrines into the groove on the anterior surface of it.
