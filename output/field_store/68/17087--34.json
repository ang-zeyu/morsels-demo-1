The present distribution of _Hylactophryne_ (isolated on the Mexican  Plateau) and its digital form (like that of Papuan and many primitive  South American leptodactylids) suggest that the genus was isolated in  Mexico throughout the Tertiary, whereas the other Central American  genera are either post-Pliocene derivatives of _Eleutherodactylus_ or  invaders of Central America from South America since the mid-Pliocene  land bridge was formed (Lloyd, 1963).    Piatt (1934) presented arguments against assigning _Eleutherodactylus  latrans_ to the genus _Lithodytes_ and concluded that it was a \"true\"  _Eleutherodactylus_. Contrary to his arguments, _latrans_ (= _augusti_  of Zweifel) and _E. tarahumarensis_ Taylor differ from all other  _Eleutherodactylus_ (and _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_) in the nature  of the tips of the digits (external and skeletal). The digits of  _Hylactophryne_ are like those of _Eupsophus_. My study of nearly all  genera of leptodactylids indicates that Noble (1925) was correct in  suggesting that _Borborocoetes_ (= _Eupsophus_) is a close relative of  _Eleutherodactylus latrans_, although Noble's arguments were based in  part upon false evidence concerning the breeding habits of _E.  latrans_, then thought to have a free-living tadpole.    Kellogg (1932) and Piatt (1934) argued that the terminal phalanges of  _E. latrans_ were typically eleutherodactyline. The variation of this  character in _Eupsophus_ (see Fig. 4) ranges from knobbed to bifurcate  or Y-shaped (T-shaped in _Eleutherodactylus_, _Syrrhophus_ and  _Tomodactylus_) and encompasses the nature of the character represented  in _Hylactophryne_. _Eupsophus_ differs from _Hylactophryne_ in  possessing a frontoparietal fontanelle, in generally having a  maxillary-quadratojugal gap, and in having a free swimming tadpole  stage.

They serve to show us the wonderful nature of man's  faithful friend, the dog, and how he has many traits of character fitted  to make him the worthy receiver of kindness and respect.              T.    [Footnote 1: It is difficult to accept T.'s explanation of the dog's  object in digging. Possibly its aim was to obtain warmth or shelter.]      BULLY'S SHORT CUT.              [_Aug. 29, 1874._]    I see that you welcome all notes of interest upon our fellow-beings, the  dogs. Here is one that seems to prove they have a sense of time and of  distance as measured by time.    I was walking with my bull-terrier, Bully (seven years old last  Christmas), during a hot afternoon this month homewards along the Bund  (Shanghai), and I suddenly missed him. I turned back for twenty or  thirty yards, and, not finding him, I gave up the search, saying, \"He  knows the way home well enough.\" Presently I saw him on my right,  dripping with water, cantering on at a round pace, without looking about  him, homewards. I watched him, curious to see whether he would go  straight home. No. He kept on till he reached the distance of about 150  yards, and looked ahead, _not_ smelling the ground. He then deliberately  walked back, catching sight of me in about twenty yards after his  turning back, and wagged his tale recognisingly. He had evidently been  to cool himself in the river (thirty yards to the right, it being low  tide), and, thinking I would go on at the ordinary pace without him, he,  after his bath, struck directly at a long diagonal for the point I would  have reached if I had not turned back to look for him. He did not seem  to have the slightest misgiving as to his sense of the distance I  _ought_ to have walked during the time of his bath. His turning was done  seemingly with a calm assurance of certainty. I may add that there were  twenty to thirty foot-passengers scattered over the portion of road in  question at the time, whose footsteps might have effaced my scent on the  _watered_ granite macadamised roadway, even supposing the dog to have  tried his sense of smell, _which he did not_, as far as I could see, and  I noticed him carefully.              W. G. S.      CANINE INTELLIGENCE.              [_July 24, 1886._]    You often give us pleasant anecdotes of our four-footed friends. You may  think the following worthy of record. I have a little dog, a not  particularly well-bred fox-terrier. He is much attached to me, and shows  by his obedience, and sometimes _in_ his disobedience, that he  understands a good deal. Yesterday I was away all day, and he, I am  told, was very uneasy, and searched everywhere for me. Every day at 5  p.m. I go to church. Toby seems to know this is not an ordinary walk,  and never offers to come with me. But yesterday, when the bell began, he  started off and took up his position by the vestry door. I believe he  reasoned with himself, \"There goes the bell; now I shall catch the  Vicar.\"    WILLIAM QUENNELL.      THE DOG AND THE FERRY.              [_April 4, 1885._]    Reading from time to time many pleasant anecdotes in the columns of the  _Spectator_--which, by the way, I receive as regularly, and read as  eagerly, as when resident in England many years ago--relative to the  sagacity of dogs, I send the following, thinking it possible you may  deem it worthy of insertion.    Some three years ago I was \"having a spell\" in Brisbane, after a  lengthened sojourn on a sheep station in the interior of Queensland.  During my stay in the city I had the good fortune to gain the friendship  of a gentleman who owned a magnificent collie. My friend, his dog Sweep,  and myself, were frequently together, engaged either in yachting among  the islands of Moreton Bay, or 'possum hunting under the towering  _eucalypti_ which fringe the banks of the river Brisbane. Naturally  \"Sweep\" (who was a most lovable animal) and myself soon began to  entertain a warm friendship for one another, which friendship gave rise  to the anecdote I am about to relate. Returning to my hotel about  midnight from the house of a friend, I was not a little startled at  finding my hand suddenly seized from behind by a dog, which, however, I  at once recognised as my handsome acquaintance, Sweep. I patted him, at  the same time endeavouring to withdraw the hand which he held firmly,  but gently, between his teeth. It was of no use, as, in spite of all my  endearments, he insisted on retaining his hold, wriggling along by my  side, and vigorously wagging his tail, as though he would say, \"Don't be  afraid; it's all right.\" We soon reached a point in the main street down  which we were walking, where a side avenue branched off towards the  river. My way lay right ahead. Sweep, however, insisted on my taking the  road which lay at a right-angle to my course. I felt some annoyance at  his persistence, as I was both tired and sleepy; but, having no choice  in the matter, I followed his lead. Having walked some two or three  hundred yards down _his_ street, he released his hold, dancing round  me, then running on for a few yards and looking back to see if I were  following. Becoming interested, I determined to see what he was after,  so, without further resistance, I followed submissively. At last, having  reached the river, which at this place was about four hundred yards  wide, he, with many joyous barks, ran down the ferry steps, and jumped  into the empty boat of the ferryman. At last I was able to guess at his  motive for forcing me to follow him. His master, who lived across the  river, had accidentally lost sight of his dog returning from his office  in the city; and Sweep appeared to understand perfectly that unless the  boatman received his fare he, Sweep, would not be carried over, my  friend frequently sending the dog over by himself when wishing to attend  concerts, &c., invariably paying the fare as of an ordinary passenger.  The ferryman, who at once recognised my canine friend, laughed heartily  when I told him how I had been served, took my penny, and set off at  once for \"Kangaroo Point,\" Sweep gaily barking \"good-night\" until he  reached the opposite bank. I heard subsequently that he used to swim the  river when left behind; but having had two narrow escapes from sharks,  his nerves had become somewhat shaken so far as water was concerned.              J. WM. CREIGHTON.      THE REASON OF DOGS.              [_Nov. 13, 1875._]    Having often read, with great pleasure, the anecdotes about dogs which  from time to time appear in the _Spectator_, I venture to send you one  which has come under my own observation, and which, it seems to me,  shows an effort of reasoning implying two distinct ideas--one the  consequence of the other--more interesting than many of those clever  performances of educated dogs which may or may not be merely mechanical  actions.    The dog who performed the following trick was then a great, half-grown,  awkward puppy, whose education, up to that time, had been much  neglected. It has been better attended to since, and now, although  sportsmen probably consider such an animal sadly thrown away upon a  lady, he is a very pleasant friend and companion. My two dogs, Guy and  Denis, form as capital a pair, for contrast's sake, as one need wish to  see. They are both handsome dogs of their kind--Guy, a fine black  retriever, with no white hair upon him, and, I believe, in the eyes of  sportsmen, as well as those of his mistress, a very desirable  possession, good-tempered, clever, and affectionate; Denis, as naughty  and spoilt a little fellow as ever existed, and a great pet, also black,  except for his yellow paws and chest, but covered with long, loose  locks, instead of Guy's small, crisp curls.    Denis is exceedingly comic, and a constant source of amusement. He is  very faithful to his mistress, whose bedside during illness he has  refused to leave, even for food; but it must be confessed that he is not  amiably disposed towards most people, and is a perfect tyrant over the  other animals. Some account of the two dogs' character is necessary, to  explain the little scene which took place between them one evening about  a year ago. Guy, it must be premised, is at least twelve months younger  than Denis, consequently, when the former first arrived--a miserable and  very ugly little puppy, a few weeks old, more like a small black jug  than any known animal of the canine species, having had the mange, and  lost all his hair--Denis undertook his education, and ruled him so  severely that his influence lasted a long while; indeed, even after Guy  had grown so big that Denis almost needed to stand upon his hind legs in  order to snap at him, the great dog would crouch meekly at a growling  remonstrance from the little master, and never dared to invade his  rights--to approach his plate of food, or to drink before him. Now a  days Guy has discovered his own power, and although too good-natured an  animal ever to ill-treat the little dog, no longer allows any liberties,  but at the same time, when the scene which I am about to describe took  place, he was still under the impression that Denis's wrath was a  terrible and dangerous matter.    And now for my story, which, it seems to me, shows as much real  reasoning power in an untrained animal as any anecdote that I ever read.  One evening I took my two dogs to the kitchen, to give them the rare  treat of a bone apiece. (Dogs were certainly never intended to make  Natal their home, for, in order to keep them alive at all, they should  never be given anything that they like, especially meat, and even then  the most careful management often fails in preserving them from disease  and death.) One of my sisters was with me, and together we watched the  dogs over their supper. Guy, with his great mouth, and"]]]
