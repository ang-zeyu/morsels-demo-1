The evening closes dark and chill, and in the gloom  of the main corner of Mariposa the Salvation Army around a naphtha lamp  lift up the confession of their sins--and that is autumn. Thus the year  runs its round, moving and changing in Mariposa, much as it does in  other places.    If, then, you feel that you know the town well enough to be admitted  into the inner life and movement of it, walk down this June afternoon  half way down the Main Street--or, if you like, half way up from the  wharf--to where Mr. Smith is standing at the door of his hostelry. You  will feel as you draw near that it is no ordinary man that you approach.  It is not alone the huge bulk of Mr. Smith (two hundred and eighty  pounds as tested on Netley's scales). It is not merely his costume,  though the chequered waistcoat of dark blue with a flowered pattern  forms, with his shepherd's plaid trousers, his grey spats and  patent-leather boots, a colour scheme of no mean order. Nor is it  merely Mr. Smith's finely mottled face. The face, no doubt, is a notable  one,--solemn, inexpressible, unreadable, the face of the heaven-born  hotel keeper. It is more than that. It is the strange dominating  personality of the man that somehow holds you captive. I know nothing in  history to compare with the position of Mr. Smith among those who drink  over his bar, except, though in a lesser degree, the relation of the  Emperor Napoleon to the Imperial Guard.    When you meet Mr. Smith first you think he looks like an over-dressed  pirate. Then you begin to think him a character. You wonder at his  enormous bulk. Then the utter hopelessness of knowing what Smith is  thinking by merely looking at his features gets on your mind and makes  the Mona Lisa seem an open book and the ordinary human countenance as  superficial as a puddle in the sunlight. After you have had a drink  in Mr. Smith's bar, and he has called you by your Christian name, you  realize that you are dealing with one of the greatest minds in the hotel  business.    Take, for instance, the big sign that sticks out into the street above  Mr. Smith's head as he stands. What is on it? \"JOS. SMITH, PROP.\"  Nothing more, and yet the thing was a flash of genius. Other men who had  had the hotel before Mr. Smith had called it by such feeble names as  the Royal Hotel and the Queen's and the Alexandria. Every one of them  failed. When Mr. Smith took over the hotel he simply put up the sign  with \"JOS. SMITH, PROP.,\" and then stood underneath in the sunshine as  a living proof that a man who weighs nearly three hundred pounds is the  natural king of the hotel business.    But on this particular afternoon, in spite of the sunshine and deep  peace, there was something as near to profound concern and anxiety as  the features of Mr. Smith were ever known to express.    The moment was indeed an anxious one. Mr. Smith was awaiting a telegram  from his legal adviser who had that day journeyed to the county town  to represent the proprietor's interest before the assembled License  Commissioners. If you know anything of the hotel business at all,  you will understand that as beside the decisions of the License  Commissioners of Missinaba County, the opinions of the Lords of the  Privy Council are mere trifles.    The matter in question was very grave. The Mariposa Court had just  fined Mr. Smith for the second time for selling liquors after hours. The  Commissioners, therefore, were entitled to cancel the license.    Mr. Smith knew his fault and acknowledged it. He had broken the law. How  he had come to do so, it passed his imagination to recall. Crime always  seems impossible in retrospect. By what sheer madness of the moment  could he have shut up the bar on the night in question, and shut Judge  Pepperleigh, the district judge in Missinaba County, outside of it? The  more so inasmuch as the closing up of the bar under the rigid license  law of the province was a matter that the proprietor never trusted to  any hands but his own. Punctually every night at 11 o'clock Mr. Smith  strolled from the desk of the \"rotunda\" to the door of the bar. If it  seemed properly full of people and all was bright and cheerful, then  he closed it. If not, he kept it open a few minutes longer till he had  enough people inside to warrant closing. But never, never unless he was  assured that Pepperleigh, the judge of the court, and Macartney, the  prosecuting attorney, were both safely in the bar, or the bar parlour,  did the proprietor venture to close up. Yet on this fatal night  Pepperleigh and Macartney had been shut out--actually left on the street  without a drink, and compelled to hammer and beat at the street door of  the bar to gain admittance.    This was the kind of thing not to be tolerated. Either a hotel must be  run decently or quit. An information was laid next day and Mr. Smith  convicted in four minutes,--his lawyers practically refusing to plead.  The Mariposa court, when the presiding judge was cold sober, and it  had the force of public opinion behind it, was a terrible engine of  retributive justice.    So no wonder that Mr. Smith awaited with anxiety the message of his  legal adviser.    He looked alternately up the street and down it again, hauled out his  watch from the depths of his embroidered pocket, and examined the hour  hand and the minute hand and the second hand with frowning scrutiny.    Then wearily, and as one mindful that a hotel man is ever the servant of  the public, he turned back into the hotel.    \"Billy,\" he said to the desk clerk, \"if a wire comes bring it into the  bar parlour.\"    The voice of Mr. Smith is of a deep guttural such as Plancon or Edouard  de Reske might have obtained had they had the advantages of the hotel  business. And with that, Mr. Smith, as was his custom in off moments,  joined his guests in the back room. His appearance, to the untrained  eye, was merely that of an extremely stout hotelkeeper walking from the  rotunda to the back bar. In reality, Mr. Smith was on the eve of one of  the most brilliant and daring strokes ever effected in the history of  licensed liquor. When I say that it was out of the agitation of this  situation that Smith's Ladies' and Gent's Cafe originated, anybody who  knows Mariposa will understand the magnitude of the moment.    Mr. Smith, then, moved slowly from the doorway of the hotel through the  \"rotunda,\" or more simply the front room with the desk and the cigar  case in it, and so to the bar and thence to the little room or back bar  behind it. In this room, as I have said, the brightest minds of Mariposa  might commonly be found in the quieter part of a summer afternoon.    To-day there was a group of four who looked up as Mr. Smith entered,  somewhat sympathetically, and evidently aware of the perplexities of the  moment.    Henry Mullins and George Duff, the two bank managers, were both present.  Mullins is a rather short, rather round, smooth-shaven man of less than  forty, wearing one of those round banking suits of pepper and salt, with  a round banking hat of hard straw, and with the kind of gold tie-pin and  heavy watch-chain and seals necessary to inspire confidence in matters  of foreign exchange. Duff is just as round and just as short, and  equally smoothly shaven, while his seals and straw hat are calculated to  prove that the Commercial is just as sound a bank as the Exchange. From  the technical point of view of the banking business, neither of them had  any objection to being in Smith's Hotel or to taking a drink as long  as the other was present. This, of course, was one of the cardinal  principles of Mariposa banking.    Then there was Mr. Diston, the high school teacher, commonly known as  the \"one who drank.\" None of the other teachers ever entered a hotel  unless accompanied by a lady or protected by a child. But as Mr.  Diston was known to drink beer on occasions and to go in and out of the  Mariposa House and Smith's Hotel, he was looked upon as a man whose life  was a mere wreck. Whenever the School Board raised the salaries of the  other teachers, fifty or sixty dollars per annum at one lift, it was  well understood that public morality wouldn't permit of an increase for  Mr. Diston.    Still more noticeable, perhaps, was the quiet, sallow looking man  dressed in black, with black gloves and with black silk hat heavily  craped and placed hollow-side-up on a chair. This was Mr. Golgotha  Gingham, the undertaker of Mariposa, and his dress was due to the fact  that he had just come from what he called an \"interment.\" Mr. Gingham  had the true spirit of his profession, and such words as \"funeral\"  or \"coffin\" or \"hearse\" never passed his lips. He spoke always of  \"interments,\" of \"caskets,\" and \"coaches,\" using terms that were  calculated rather to bring out the majesty and sublimity of death than  to parade its horrors.    To be present at the hotel was in accord with Mr. Gingham's general  conception of his business. No man had ever grasped the true principles  of undertaking more thoroughly than Mr. Gingham. I have often heard him  explain that to associate with the living, uninteresting though they  appear, is the only way to secure the custom of the dead.    \"Get to know people really well while they are alive,\" said Mr. Gingham;  \"be friends with them, close friends and then when they die you don't  need to worry. You'll get the order every time.\"    So, naturally, as the moment was one of sympathy, it was Mr. Gingham who  spoke first.    \"What'll you do, Josh,\" he said, \"if the Commissioners go against you?\"    \"Boys,\" said Mr. Smith, \"I don't rightly know. If I have to quit, the  next move is to the city. But I don't reckon that I will have to quit.  I've got an idee that I think's good every time.\"    \"Could you run a hotel in the city?\" asked Mullins.    \"I could,\" said Mr. Smith. \"I'll tell you.

They are emphatically and  in the truest sense, children of destiny. If we seek their origin, and  would know their truth, we must not halt beside the humble cradle  which \"lulled their infant cares to rest.\" We must rise on spirit  wings above the mists and vapors of mortality, and survey them in the  light of an eternal existence, a life without beginning or end. Says  one of old:        \"Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that      were organized before the world was; and among all these there      were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls      that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he      said, 'These I will make my rulers'; for he stood among those that      were spirits, and he saw that they were good, and he said unto me,      Abraham, thou art one of them, thou wast chosen before thou wast      born.\"    Again, unto Jeremiah:        \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou      camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained      thee a prophet unto the nations.\"    What is true in this respect of ancient prophets, is true also of  modern prophets, for verily are their origin, their mission and their  destiny the same.    It devolved upon the subject of this writing to come forth at a time  which has no parallel in all the ages of the past. The day of God's  power and of Zion's glory was about to dawn. The Sun that set in blood  behind Judea's hills was soon to rise o'er Zion's mountain-tops and  flood the world with light. The latter-day dispensation was opening.  All things in Christ were to be gathered in one. The curtain of  history had risen on the last act of the tragedy of Time.    Would God leave the world without \"great and noble ones\" at such an  hour?    ----    Heber Chase Kimball was born into this life June 14th, 1801. The same  soil produced him that in colonial times brought forth an Ethan Allen,  the hero of Ticonderoga, and in later years the wondrous twain of  spirits known to the world as Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.    A far greater work than the capture of a British fortress was in the  future of this Mormon triad of \"Green Mountain boys,\" who went forth  \"in the name of the great Jehovah\" to invade the strongholds of Satan,  and plant the banner of gospel truth above the ramparts of his  conquered citadels.    Heber's birthplace was the town of Sheldon, Franklin County, Vermont,  ten miles from the shores of Lake Champlain. He was the fourth child  and second son in a family of seven, the order of whose birth was as  follows: Charles Spaulding, Eliza, Abigail, Heber Chase, Melvina,  Solomon and Daniel Spaulding, the last named of whom died in infancy.  These were all born in Sheldon.    His father's name was Solomon Farnham Kimball, a native of  Massachusetts, where he was born in the year 1770. He was \"a man of  good moral character,\" and, though he professed no religion, taught  his children correct principles. His mother's maiden name was Anna  Spaulding; she was a strict Presbyterian, lived a virtuous life, and,  according to her best knowledge, reared her family in the ways of  righteousness. She was the daughter of Daniel and Speedy Spaulding,  and was born in Plainfield, New Hampshire, on the banks of the  Connecticut river.    The Kimballs were of Scotch descent, their ancient name, it is  believed, being Campbell. Heber's grandfather and a brother came from  England, in time to assist in gaining the independence of the  colonies. In America his ancestors and those of the Prophet Joseph  Smith were related by marriage.    Heber derived his given name from a Judge Chase, of Massachusetts, by  whom his father was reared from a boy, and who chanced to visit his  former protege soon after his son was born. The judge himself proposed  the christening, and the parents being nothing loth, Heber Chase  Kimball became the infant's name.    This Judge Chase, though presumably \"learned in the law,\" like many of  his class in those primitive, common sense days was not above  following the humbler pursuits of life. He was a blacksmith, and  taught Heber's father that trade, and when he had married, helped him  to establish his smithy in the town of Sheldon.    \"At the close of the Revolutionary War,\" says Heber, \"my father was  thirteen years old, and I can remember his rehearsing to me some of  the scenes of the war.    \"He was captain of a company of militia in Sheldon, and wore a cocked  hat of the old English style, a straightbodied coat, and short  breeches with a knee buckle, long stockings, and Suwarrow boots with a  pair of tassels.    \"He was partly bald, had dark-brown hair, blue eyes, sandy whiskers  and light complexion; he was five feet, eleven inches high, and  weighed two hundred pounds and upwards.    \"He engaged in farming and clearing land, burning the wood into coal  and ashes; he had also a forge and trip-hammer, in the manufacture of  wrought iron.    \"About the time of the embargo, before the last war with England, my  father lost his property, as it was invested in salts, potash and  pearlash; the embargo, having shut down the gate of commerce between  the United States and England, left his property in his hands without  much value.\"    In February, 1811, the Kimballs migrated from Vermont, and settled in  West Bloomfield, Ontario County, New York, five hundred miles from  their former"]]]
