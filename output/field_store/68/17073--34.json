There are, nevertheless, two specimens preserved. One is a  young bull (skull only) from Farmington Canyon, Davis County, in the  collection of Weber College, Ogden, Utah. The other is one antler (No.  10,745) of a young bull from Henrys Fork, 16 miles south of the  Utah-Wyoming border, Summit County, and it is in the collection of the  University of Utah. This large cervid apparently is increasing in  numbers in the state. Dale Jones of the Utah State Fish and Game  Department reported to us that a herd of 25 animals was observed in  1954, in the vicinity of Haydens Peak, Bear River Drainage, Summit  County. A cow and a calf were seen in the vicinity of Strawberry  Reservoir, Wasatch County, in 1951, by employees of the same  department. This latter locality is the most southern and eastern point  of their known occurrence in Utah.    _=Ovis canadensis canadensis=_ Shaw. Mountain Sheep.--Formerly, the  mountain sheep was not known to occur in the La Sal Mountains in Grand  and San Juan counties. On October 23, 1954, a two year old ram, No.  10,906, was killed by a deer hunter at a locality 1-1/2 miles north of  La Sal, La Sal Mountains, San Juan County. This constitutes the first  complete specimen (skin and skull) of a mountain sheep from Utah.  According to Harold Crane, of the Utah State Fish and Game Department,  this ram was running with a herd of mule deer, and was the only  mountain sheep that was seen. The ram was confiscated and given to the  Department of Zoology, University of Utah, for preservation as a  scientific specimen.      LITERATURE CITED    DAVIS, W. B.        1939.

In the autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth  to a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May Mercy  Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.    William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically  unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and  closing it for ever. Securing temporary quarters for himself and his  wife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he arranged for the building  of a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part of  the town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee was  born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce  drove them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, in  the newer East Side residence district, where the late Archer Harris  built his sumptuous but hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876. William  and Phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, but Dutee  was brought up by his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg's son.    Rathbone was a practical man, and rented the Benefit Street house  despite William's wish to keep it vacant. He considered it an obligation  to his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor did he  concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so many  changes of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which the  house was generally regarded. It is likely that he felt only vexation  when, in 1804, the town council ordered him to fumigate the place with  sulfur, tar, and gum camphor on account of the much-discussed deaths of  four persons, presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic.  They said the place had a febrile smell.    Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a  privateersman, and served with distinction on the _Vigilant_ under  Captain Cahoone in the War of 1812. He returned unharmed, married in  1814, and became a father on that memorable night of September 23, 1815,  when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town, and  floated a tall sloop well up Westminster Street so that its masts almost  tapped the Harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy,  Welcome, was a seaman's son.    Welcome did not survive his father, but lived to perish gloriously at  Fredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the  shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to  rent--perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt old  age. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in  1861, which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity.  Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only as a deserted and  somewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him my experience. He  had meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site, but  after my account decided to let it stand, install plumbing, and rent it.  Nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants. The horror has  gone.      3    It may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals of  the Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a  persistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil  clearly connected with the house and not with the family. This  impression was confirmed by my uncle's less systematic array of  miscellaneous data--legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttings  from the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow-physicians, and  the like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a  tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;  but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their  recurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the  servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous  and malodorous _cellar_ of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.  There had been servants--Ann White especially--who would not use the  cellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon the  queer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and patches  of mold in that region. These latter narratives interested me  profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that  most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by  additions from the common stock of local ghost lore.    Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most  extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that  there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires--the dead  who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the  living--whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits  abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say,  exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that  organ; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been  prominent in bringing about her discharge.    Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readily  accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial  purposes. To me their interest depended less on this circumstance than  on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with certain  other things--the complaint of the departing servant Preserved Smith,  who had preceded Ann and never heard of her, that something \"sucked his  breath\" at night; the death-certificates of the fever victims of 1804,  issued by Doctor Chad Hopkins, and showing the four deceased persons all  unaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure passages of poor Rhoby  Harris's ravings, where she complained of the sharp teeth of a  glassy-eyed, half-visible presence.    Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in  me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated  newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house--one from the  _Providence Gazette and Country-Journal_ of April 12, 1815, and the  other from the _Daily Transcript and Chronicle_ of October 27,  1845--each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose  duplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying  person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a  schoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in  a horrible way, glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of  the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case  which put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia deaths  preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily  attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist.    This was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medical  practise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his  elder professional colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the way  in which the victims--ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and widely  shunned house could now be rented to no others--would babble  maledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied  to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century  before, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical  data on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his return  from the war, to the first-hand account of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.  Indeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, and  that he was glad of my own interest--an open-minded and sympathetic  interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others  would merely have laughed. His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but he  felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, and  worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and  macabre.    For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profound  seriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but to  accumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer  Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916;  and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an  authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected.  When, however, I asked them what connection with France or its language  the house could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and  ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could say  was that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee Harris, had heard of  might have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his son  Welcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known the  legend, but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins,  seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird  significance to the French raving of Rhoby Harris, which she had so  often heard during the last days of that hapless woman. Maria had been  at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783,  and had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a  somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soon  forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar. The  granddaughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. She  and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was Archer's  son Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my  experience.           *       *       *       *       *    Having exhausted the Harris family of all the information it could  furnish, I turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a  zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown in  the same work.
