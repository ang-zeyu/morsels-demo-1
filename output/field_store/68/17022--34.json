[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#3)"],[1," to a certainty, and there would  be little scope left for all that skill and perseverance shown by the men  who have left an enduring monument of their success in the present state of  our domesticated animals.    It is hardly possible, within a moderate compass, to impress on the mind of  those who have not attended to the subject, the full conviction of the  force of inheritance which is slowly acquired by rearing animals, by  studying the many treatises which have been published on the various  domestic animals, and by conversing with breeders. I will select a few  facts of the kind, which, as far as I can judge, have most influenced my  own mind. With man and the domestic animals, certain peculiarities have  appeared in an individual, at rare intervals, or only once or twice in the  history of the world, but have reappeared in several of the children and  grandchildren. Thus Lambert, \"the porcupine-man,\" whose skin was thickly  covered with warty projections, which were periodically moulted, had all  his six children and two grandsons similarly affected.[5] The face and body  being covered with long hair, accompanied by deficient teeth (to which I  shall hereafter refer), occurred in three successive generations in a  Siamese family; but this case is not unique, as a woman[6] with a  completely hairy face was exhibited in London in 1663, and another instance  has recently occurred. Colonel Hallam[7] has described a race of two-legged  pigs, \"the hinder extremities being entirely wanting;\" and this deficiency  was transmitted through three generations. In fact, all races presenting  any remarkable peculiarity, such as solid-hoofed swine, Mauchamp sheep,  niata cattle, &c., are instances of the long-continued inheritance of rare  deviations of structure.    When we reflect that certain extraordinary peculiarities have {5} thus  appeared in a single individual out of many millions, all exposed in the  same country to the same general conditions of life, and, again, that the  same extraordinary peculiarity has sometimes appeared in individuals living  under widely different conditions of life, we are driven to conclude that  such peculiarities are not directly due to the action of the surrounding  conditions, but to unknown laws acting on the organisation or constitution  of the individual;--that their production stands in hardly closer relation  to the conditions than does life itself. If this be so, and the occurrence  of the same unusual character in the child and parent cannot be attributed  to both having been exposed to the same unusual conditions, then the  following problem is worth consideration, as showing that the result cannot  be due, as some authors have supposed, to mere coincidence, but must be  consequent on the members of the same family inheriting something in common  in their constitution. Let it be assumed that, in a large population, a  particular affection occurs on an average in one out of a million, so that  the _a priori_ chance that an individual taken at random will be so  affected is only one in a million. Let the population consist of sixty  millions, composed, we will assume, of ten million families, each  containing six members. On these data, Professor Stokes has calculated for  me that the odds will be no less than 8333 millions to 1 that in the ten  million families there will not be even a single family in which one parent  and two children will be affected by the peculiarity in question. But  numerous cases could be given, in which several children have been affected  by the same rare peculiarity with one of their parents; and in this case,  more especially if the grandchildren be included in the calculation, the  odds against mere coincidence become something prodigious, almost beyond  enumeration.    In some respects the evidence of inheritance is more striking when we  consider the reappearance of trifling peculiarities. Dr. Hodgkin formerly  told me of an English family in which, for many generations, some members  had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the hair. I knew an  Irish gentleman, who, on the right side of his head, had a small white lock  in the midst of his dark hair: he assured me that his grandmother had {6} a  similar lock on the same side, and his mother on the opposite side. But it  is superfluous to give instances; every shade of expression, which may  often be seen alike in parents and children, tells the same story. On what  a curious combination of corporeal structure, mental character, and  training, must handwriting depend! yet every one must have noted the  occasional close similarity of the handwriting in father and son, although  the father had not taught his son. A great collector of franks assured me  that in his collection there were several franks of father and son hardly  distinguishable except by their dates. Hofacker, in Germany, remarks on the  inheritance of handwriting; and it has even been asserted that English boys  when taught to write in France naturally cling to their English manner of  writing.[8] Gait, gestures, voice, and general bearing are all inherited,  as the illustrious Hunter and Sir A. Carlisle have insisted.[9] My father  communicated to me two or three striking instances, in one of which a man  died during the early infancy of his son, and my father, who did not see  this son until grown up and out of health, declared that it seemed to him  as if his old friend had risen from the grave, with all his highly peculiar  habits and manners. Peculiar manners pass into tricks, and several  instances could be given of their inheritance; as in the case, often  quoted, of the father who generally slept on his back, with his right leg  crossed over the left, and whose daughter, whilst an infant in the cradle,  followed exactly the same habit, though an attempt was made to cure  her.[10] I will give one instance which has fallen under my own  observation, and which is curious from being a trick associated with a  peculiar state of mind, namely, pleasurable emotion. A boy had the singular  habit, when pleased, of rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other,  and, when much excited, of raising both hands, with the fingers still  moving, to the sides of his face on a level with the eyes; this boy, when  almost an old man, could still hardly resist this trick when much pleased,  but from its absurdity concealed it. He had eight children. Of these, a  girl, when {7} pleased, at the age of four and a half years, moved her  fingers in exactly the same way, and what is still odder, when much  excited, the raised both her hands, with her fingers still moving, to the  sides of her face, in exactly the same manner as her father had done, and  sometimes even still continued to do when alone. I never heard of any one  excepting this one man and his little daughter who had this strange habit;  and certainly imitation was in this instance out of the question.    Some writers have doubted whether those complex mental attributes, on which  genius and talent depend, are inherited, even when both parents are thus  endowed. But he who will read Mr. Galton's able paper[11] on hereditary  talent will have his doubts allayed.    Unfortunately it matters not, as far as inheritance is concerned, how  injurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life. No one can  read the many treatises[12] on hereditary disease and doubt this. The  ancients were strongly of this opinion, or, as Ranchin expresses it, _Omnes  Graeci, Arabes, et Latini in eo consentiunt_. A long catalogue could be  given of all sorts of inherited malformations and of predisposition to  various diseases. With gout, fifty per cent. of the cases observed in  hospital practice are, according to Dr. Garrod, inherited, and a greater  percentage in private practice. Every one knows how often insanity runs in  families, and some of the cases given by Mr. Sedgwick are awful,--as of a  surgeon, whose brother, father, and four paternal uncles were all insane,  the latter dying by suicide; of a Jew, whose father, mother, and six  brothers and sisters were all mad; and in some other cases several members  of the same family, during three or four successive generations, have  committed suicide. Striking instances {8} have been recorded of epilepsy,  consumption, asthma, stone in the bladder, cancer, profuse bleeding from  the slightest injuries, of the mother not giving milk, and of bad  parturition being inherited. In this latter respect I may mention an odd  case given by a good observer,[13] in which the fault lay in the offspring,  and not in the mother: in a part of Yorkshire the farmers continued to  select cattle with large hind-quarters, until they made a strain called  \"Dutch-buttocked,\" and \"the monstrous size of the buttocks of the calf was  frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows were annually lost in  calving.\"        Instead of giving numerous details on various inherited malformations      and diseases, I will confine myself to one organ, that which is the      most complex, delicate, and probably best-known in the human frame,      namely, the eye, with its accessory parts. To begin with the latter: I      have heard of a family in which parents and children were affected by      drooping eyelids, in so peculiar a manner, that they could not see      without throwing their heads backwards; and Sir A. Carlisle[14]      specifies a pendulous fold to the eyelids as inherited. \"In a family,\"      says Sir H. Holland,[15] \"where the father had a singular elongation of      the upper eyelid, seven or eight children were born with the same      deformity; two or three other children having it not.\" Many persons, as      I year from Mr. Paget, have two or three of the hairs in their eyebrows      (apparently corresponding with the vibrissae of the lower animals) much      longer than the others; and even so trifling a peculiarity as this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1,"crept into my  limbs. My head grew heavy, my eyes dim, my knees jerked and trembled,  and there the wolves dared chase me.    \"I went again to the cave that had been my home when I was an old man.    \"One day I stole from the cave to snatch a mouthful of grass, for I was  closely besieged by wolves. They made their rush, and I barely escaped  from them. They sat beyond the cave staring at me.    \"I knew their tongue. I knew all that they said to each other, and all  that they said to me. But there was yet a thud left in my forehead, a  deadly trample in my hoof. They did not dare come into the cave.    \"'To-morrow,' they said, 'we will tear out your throat, and gnaw on your  living haunch'.\"        CHAPTER VII    \"Then my soul rose to the height of Doom, and I intended all that might  happen to me, and agreed to it.    \"'To-morrow,' I said, 'I will go out among ye, and I will die,' and at  that the wolves howled joyfully, hungrily, impatiently.    \"I slept, and I saw myself changing into a boar in dream, and I felt in  dream the beating of a new heart within me, and in dream I stretched my  powerful neck and braced my eager limbs. I awoke from my dream, and I  was that which I had dreamed.    \"The night wore away, the darkness lifted, the day came; and from  without the cave the wolves called to me: \"'Come out, O Skinny Stag.  Come out and die.'    \"And I, with joyful heart, thrust a black bristle through the hole of  the cave, and when they saw that wriggling snout, those curving tusks,  that red fierce eye, the wolves fled yelping, tumbling over each other,  frantic with terror; and I behind them, a wild cat for leaping, a giant  for strength, a devil for ferocity; a madness and gladness of lusty,  unsparing life; a killer, a champion, a boar who could not be defied.    \"I took the lordship of the boars of Ireland.    \"Wherever I looked among my tribes I saw love and obedience: whenever  I appeared among the strangers they fled away. And the wolves feared me  then, and the great, grim bear went bounding on heavy paws. I charged  him at the head of my troop and rolled him over and over; but it is not  easy to kill the bear, so deeply is his life packed under that stinking  pelt. He picked himself up and ran, and was knocked down, and ran again  blindly, butting into trees and stones. Not a claw did the big bear  flash, not a tooth did he show, as he ran whimpering like a baby, or  as he stood with my nose rammed against his mouth, snarling up into his  nostrils.    \"I challenged all that moved. All creatures but one. For men had again  come to Ireland. Semion, the son of Stariath, with his people, from whom  the men of Domnann and the Fir Bolg and the Galiuin are descended. These  I did not chase, and when they chased me I fled.    \"Often I would go, drawn by my memoried heart, to look at them as they  moved among their fields; and I spoke to my mind in bitterness: 'When  the people of Partholon were gathered in counsel my voice was heard; it  was sweet to all who heard it, and the words I spoke were wise. The eyes  of women brightened and softened when they looked at me. They loved to  hear him when he sang who now wanders in the forest with a tusky herd.'\"        CHAPTER VIII    \"OLD age again overtook me. Weariness stole into my limbs, and anguish  dozed into my mind. I went to my Ulster cave and dreamed my dream, and I  changed into a hawk.    \"I left the ground. The sweet air was my kingdom, and my bright eye  stared on a hundred miles. I soared, I swooped; I hung, motionless as a  living stone, over the abyss; I lived in joy and slept in peace, and had  my fill of the sweetness of life.    \"During that time Beothach, the son of Iarbonel the Prophet, came to  Ireland with his people, and there was a great battle between his men  and the children of Semion. Long I hung over that combat, seeing every  spear that hurtled, every stone that whizzed from a sling, every sword  that flashed up and down, and the endless glittering of the shields. And  at the end I saw that the victory was with Iarbonel. And from his people  the Tuatha De' and the Ande' came, although their origin is forgotten,  and learned people, because of their excellent wisdom and intelligence,  say that they came from heaven.    \"These are the people of Faery. All these are the gods.    \"For long, long years I was a hawk. I knew every hill and stream; every  field and glen of Ireland. I knew the shape of cliffs and coasts, and  how all places looked under the sun or moon. And I was still a hawk when  the sons of Mil drove the Tuatha De' Danann under the ground, and held  Ireland against arms or wizardry; and this was the coming of men and the  beginning of genealogies.    \"Then I grew old, and in my Ulster cave close to the sea I dreamed my  dream, and in it I became a salmon. The green tides of ocean rose over  me and my dream, so that I drowned in the sea and did not die, for I  awoke in deep waters, and I was that which I dreamed. I had been a man,  a stag, a boar, a bird, and now I was a fish. In all my changes I had  joy and fulness of life. But in the water joy lay deeper, life pulsed  deeper. For on land or air there is always something excessive and  hindering; as arms that swing at the sides of a man, and which the  mind must remember. The stag has legs to be tucked away for sleep, and  untucked for movement; and the bird has wings that must be folded and  pecked and cared for. But the fish has but one piece from his nose to  his tail. He is complete, single and unencumbered. He turns in one turn,  and goes up and down and round in one sole movement.    \"How I flew through the soft element: how I joyed in the country where  there is no harshness: in the element which upholds and gives way; which  caresses and lets go, and will not let you fall. For man may stumble in  a furrow; the stag tumble from a cliff; the hawk, wing-weary and beaten,  with darkness around him and the storm behind, may dash his brains  against a tree. But the home of the salmon is his delight, and the sea  guards all her creatures.\"        CHAPTER IX    \"I became the king of the salmon, and, with my multitudes, I ranged on  the tides of the world. Green and purple distances were under me: green  and gold the sunlit regions above. In these latitudes I moved through a  world of amber, myself amber and gold; in those others, in a sparkle  of lucent blue, I curved, lit like a living jewel: and in these again,  through dusks of ebony all mazed with silver, I shot and shone, the  wonder of the sea.    \"I saw the monsters of the uttermost ocean go heaving by; and the long  lithe brutes that are toothed to their tails: and below, where gloom  dipped down on gloom, vast, livid tangles that coiled and uncoiled, and  lapsed down steeps and hells of the sea where even the salmon could not  go.    \"I knew the sea. I knew the secret caves where ocean roars to ocean; the  floods that are icy cold, from which the nose of a salmon leaps back as  at a sting; and the warm streams in which we rocked and dozed and were  carried forward without motion. I swam on the outermost rim of the great  world, where nothing was but the sea and the sky and the salmon; where  even the wind was silent, and the water was clear as clean grey rock.    \"And then, far away in the sea, I remembered Ulster, and there came on  me an instant, uncontrollable anguish to be there. I turned, and through  days and nights I swam tirelessly, jubilantly; with terror wakening in  me, too, and a whisper through my being that I must reach Ireland or  die.    \"I fought my way to Ulster from the sea.    \"Ah, how that end of the journey was hard! A sickness was racking in  every one of my bones, a languor and weariness creeping through my every  fibre and muscle. The waves held me back and held me back; the soft  waters seemed to have grown hard; and it was as though I were urging  through a rock as I strained towards Ulster from the sea.    \"So tired I was! I could have loosened my frame and been swept away;  I could have slept and been drifted and wafted away; swinging on  grey-green billows that had turned from the land and were heaving and  mounting and surging to the far blue water.    \"Only the unconquerable heart of the salmon could brave that end of  toil. The sound of the rivers of Ireland racing down to the sea came to  me in the last numb effort: the love of Ireland bore me up: the gods of  the rivers trod to me in the white-curled breakers, so that I left  the sea at long, long last; and I lay in sweet water in the curve of a  crannied rock, exhausted, three parts dead, triumphant.\"        CHAPTER X    \"Delight and strength came to me again, and now I explored all the  inland ways, the great lakes of Ireland, and her swift brown rivers.    \"What a joy to lie under an inch of water basking in the sun, or beneath  a shady ledge to watch the small creatures that speed like lightning on  the rippling top. I saw the dragon-flies flash and dart and turn, with  a poise, with a speed that no other winged thing knows: I saw the hawk  hover and stare and swoop: he fell like a falling stone, but he could  not catch the king of the salmon: I saw the cold-eyed cat stretching  along a bough level with the water, eager to hook and lift the creatures  of the river. And I saw men.    \"They saw me also. They came to know me and look for me. They lay in  wait at the waterfalls up which I leaped like a silver flash. They held  out nets for me; they hid traps under leaves; they made cords of the  colour of water, of the colour of weeds--but this salmon had a nose that  knew how a weed felt and how a string--they drifted meat on a sightless  string, but I knew of the hook; they thrust spears at me, and threw  lances which they drew back again with a cord. Many a wound I got from  men, many a sorrowful scar.    \"Every beast pursued me in the waters and along the banks; the barking,  black-skinned otter came after me in "]]]
