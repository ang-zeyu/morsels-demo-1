Let us approve the exit of the folio and the quarto, and applaud  the modern tendency toward little and handy volumes. Large paper however  is a worthy distinction when the subject is worth the distinction and the  edition is not too large. Nothing raises the gorge of the true Book-Worm  more than to see an issue on large paper of a row of histories, for  example; and the very worst instance conceivable was a large paper  Webster's \"Unabridged Dictionary\" issued some years ago. The book thus  distinguished ought to be a classic, or peculiar for elegance, never a  series, or stereotyped, the first struck off, and the issue ought not to  be more than from fifty to one hundred copies; any larger issue is not  worth the extra margin bestowed, and no experienced buyer will tolerate  it. But if all these conditions are observed, the large paper copies  bear the same relation to the small that a proof before letters of a print  holds to the other impressions. Large margins are very pleasant in a  library as well as in Wall Street, and much more apt to be permanent.  There are some favorite books of which the possessor longs in vain for a  large copy, as for instance, the Pickering \"Walton and Cotton.\"    A great deal of fun is made of the Book-Worm because of his desire for  large paper and of his insistence on uncut edges, but his reasons are  sound and his taste is unimpeachable. The tricks of the book-trade to  catch the inexperienced with the bait of large paper are very amusing.  \"Strictly limited\" to so many copies for England and so many for America,  say a thousand in all, or else the number is not stated, and always  described as an edition de luxe, and its looks are always very repulsive.  But the bait is eagerly bitten at by a shoal of beings anxious to get one  of these rarities--a class to one of whom I once found it necessary to  explain that \"uncut edges\" does not mean leaves not cut open, and that he  would not injure the value of his book by being able to read it, and was  not bound to peep in surreptitiously like a maid-servant at a door \"on  the jar.\" I once knew a satirical Book-Worm who issued a pamphlet, \"one  hundred copies on large paper, none on small.\" There is no just  distinction in an ugly large-paper issue, and sometimes it is not nearly  so beautiful as the small, especially when the latter has uncut edges. The  independence of the collector who prefers the small in such circumstances  is to be commended and imitated.    Too great inequality in uncut edges is also to be shunned as an ugliness.  It seems that some French books are printed on paper of two different  sizes, the effect of which is very grotesque, and the device is a catering  to a very crude and extravagant taste.          V.    BINDING.      The binding of books for several centuries has held the dignity of a fine  art, quite independent of printing. This has been demonstrated by  exhibitions in this country and abroad. But every collector ought to  observe fitness in the binding which he procures to be executed. True  fitness prevails in most old and fine bindings; seldom was a costly garb  bestowed on a book unworthy of it. But in many a luxurious library we see  a modern binding fit for a unique or rare book given to one that is  comparatively worthless or common. Not to speak of bindings that are real  works of art, many collectors go astray in dressing lumber in purple and  fine linen--putting full levant morocco on blockhead histories and such  stuff that perishes in the not using. It is a sad spectacle to behold a  unique binding wasted on a book of no more value than a backgammon board.  There are of course not a great many of us who can afford unique bindings,  but those who cannot should at least observe propriety and fitness in this  regard, and draw the line severely between full dress and demi-toilette,  and keep a sharp eye to appropriateness of color. I have known several men  who bound their books all alike. Nothing could be worse except one who  should bind particular subjects in special styles, pace Mr. Ellwanger,  who, in \"The Story of My House,\" advises the Book-Worm to \"bind the poets  in yellow or orange, books on nature in olive, the philosophers in blue,  the French classics in red,\" etc. I am curious to know what color this  pleasant writer would adopt for the binding of his books by military men,  such for example as \"Major Walpole's Anecdotes.\" (p. 262).    Ambrose Fermin Didot recommended binding the \"Iliad\" in red and the  \"Odyssey\" in blue, for the Greek rhapsodists wore a scarlet cloak when  they recited the former and a blue one when they recited the latter. The  churchmen he would clothe in violet, cardinals in scarlet, philosophers in  black.    I have imagined      HOW A BIBLIOMANIAC BINDS HIS BOOKS.      I'd like my favorite books to bind      So that their outward dress    To every bibliomaniac's mind      Their contents should express.      Napoleon's life should glare in red,      John Calvin's gloom in blue;    Thus they would typify bloodshed      And sour religion's hue.      The prize-ring record of the past      Must be in blue and black;    While any color that is fast      Would do for Derby track.      The Popes in scarlet well may go;      In jealous green, Othello;    In gray, Old Age of Cicero,      And London Cries in yellow.      My Walton should his gentle art      In Salmon best express,    And Penn and Fox the friendly heart      In quiet drab confess.      Statistics of the lumber trade      Should be embraced in boards,    While muslin for the inspired Maid      A fitting garb affords.      Intestine wars I'd clothe in vellum,      While pig-skin Bacon grasps,    And flat romances, such as \"Pelham,\"      Should stand in calf with clasps.      Blind-tooled should be blank verse and rhyme      Of Homer and of Milton;    But Newgate Calendar of Crime      I'd lavishly dab gilt on.      The edges of a sculptor's life      May fitly marbled be,    But sprinkle not, for fear of strife,      A Baptist history.      Crimea's warlike facts and dates      Of fragrant Russia smell;    The subjugated Barbary States      In crushed Morocco dwell.      But oh! that one I hold so dear      Should be arrayed so cheap    Gives me a qualm; I sadly fear      My Lamb must be half-sheep.    No doubt a Book-Worm so far gone as this could invent stricter analogies  and make even the binder fit the book.    So we should have      THE BIBLIOMANIAC'S ASSIGNMENT OF BINDERS.      If I could bring the dead to day,      I would your soul with wonder fill    By pointing out a novel way      For bibliopegistic skill.      My Walton, Trautz should take in hand,      Or else I'd give him o'er to Hering;    Matthews should make the Gospels stand      A solemn warning to the erring.      The history of the Inquisition,      With all its diabolic train    Of cruelty and superstition,      Should fitly be arrayed by Payne.      A book of dreams by Bedford clad,      A Papal history by De Rome,    Should make the sense of fitness glad      In every bibliomaniac's home.      As our first mother's folly cost      Her sex so dear, and makes men grieve,    So Milton's plaint of Eden lost      Would be appropriate to Eve.      Hayday would make \"One Summer\" be      Doubly attractive to the view;    While General Wolfe's biography      Should be the work of Pasdeloup.      For lives of dwarfs, like Thomas Thumb,      Petit's the man by nature made,    And when Munchasen strikes us dumb      It is by means of Gascon aid.      Thus would I the great binders blend      In harmony with work before 'em,    And so Riviere I would commend      To Turner's \"Liber Fluviorum.\"    After all, whether one can afford a three-hundred or a three-dollar  binding, the gentle Elia has said the last word about fitness of bindings  when he observed: \"To be strong-backed and neat-bound is the desideratum  of a volume; magnificence comes after. This, when it can be afforded, is  not to be lavished on all kinds of books indiscriminately.    \"Where we know that a book is at once both good and rare--where the  individual is almost the species,      'We know not where is that Prometian torch    That can its light relumine;'    \"Such a book for instance as the 'Life of the Duke of Newcastle' by his  Duchess--no casket is rich enough, no casing sufficiently durable, to  honor and keep safe such a jewel.    \"To view a well arranged assortment of block-headed encyclopoedias  (Anglicana or Metropolitanas), set out in an array of Russia and Morocco,  when a tithe of that good leather would comfortably reclothe my shivering  folios, would renovate Parcelsus himself, and enable old Raymond Lully to  look like himself again in the world. I never see these impostors but I  long to strip them and warm my ragged veterans in their spoils.\"    There spoke the true Book-Worm. What a pity he could not have sold a part  of his good sense and fine taste to some of the affluent collectors of  this period!    Doubtless an experienced binder could give some amusing examples of  mistakes in indorsing books with their names. One remains in my memory. A  French binder, entrusted with a French translation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\"  in two volumes, put \"L'Oncle\" on both, and numbered them \"Tome 1,\" \"Tome  2.\" Charles Cowden-Clarke tells of his having ordered Leigh Hunt's poems  entitled \"Foliage\" to be bound in green, and how the book came home in  blue. That would answer for the \"blue grass\" region of Kentucky. I have  no patience with those disgusting realists who bind books in human or  snake skin. In his charming book on the Law Reporters, Mr. Wallace says of  Desaussures' South Carolina Reports: \"When these volumes are found in  their original binding most persons, I think, are struck with its  peculiarity. The cause of it is, I believe, that it was done by negroes.\"  What the \"peculiarity\" is he does not disclose. But book-bi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#3)"],[1,"te, and the Grey. Of these the Brock is perhaps the commonest, and is  the name most used in the north of England. There is an expression  common in the north that would lead the ignorant to believe that a  badger perspires, or sweats, viz. \"sweating like a brock.\" In Yorkshire  I often hear a man say, \"Ah sweats like a brock,\" and the user of this  elegant metaphor innocently imagines he is perspiring like a badger. But  \"brock\" is the old north-country word for the insect known as  \"cuckoo-spit\" (_Aphrophora spumaria_), which covers itself in the larval  state with froth and foam (cf. Welsh _broch_, foam)--_vide_ Atkinson's  _Dictionary of the Cleveland Dialect_. In parts of Cornwall and Wales  the word \"Grey\" may be in use, but I myself have only come across it in  books, more especially old ones. Though able to boast these several  titles, there is but one species known in Europe, and in general  appearance he is the same animal, though varying locally in size and  shade of colour. He has been classed as belonging to the bear tribe, but  the badger is really a single species and a sub-genus in itself. The  dentition of a badger is half tuberculous and half carnivorous, and in  this respect approaches the martens.    About few animals has there been more nonsense written in regard to  habits and anatomy, and for many of the popular notions concerning the  badger there is no foundation whatever. In the ancient books descriptive  of sport and wild animals we read that there were in England two kinds  of badger--the one as we know it, and the other a \"pig-badger,\" with  cloven hoofs and other attributes of the porker. It is astonishing how  these old authors drew upon their imagination, and where they found  suggestions for their errors. In this case it may be they were misled by  the custom, which still continues, of distinguishing between the dog and  bitch, or male and female badger, by using the terms boar and sow; or it  may be the idea dawned whilst they ate their rasher from a badger ham!    There are altogether not more than five (or perhaps six) kinds of badger  known throughout the world, so far as I know.[1]        [1] Lydekker, whose authority I accept, enumerates four kinds of          badger--            1. The American (_Taxidea americana_).          2. The Common (_Meles taxus_).          3. Malayan (_Mydaus meliceps_).          4. The Sand-badger (_Arctonyx collaris_).]    1. The European badger, known over almost the whole of Europe and Asia.  2. A larger species, confined to the high steppes of Eastern Siberia. 3.  The North American mistonusk, or chocaratouch (_Meles labradorica_ or  _hudsonius_). 4. The Mexican badger, found south of latitude 35 degrees.  5. The Japanese badger. 6. The Indian badger (_Meles indica_) might be  added perhaps, though it has a pig's snout, long legs, and long tail.  Its native name is bhalloo-soor, _i.e._ the bear pig.    Nos. 3 and 4, the chocaratouch and Mexican, differ so distinctly from  the others in dentition, though in appearance similar to the European  species, that a new genus, Taxidea, has been established for their  reception.[2]        [2] In Lower California there is a variety of badger which differs          from described forms by its dark colouration and broad nuchal          stripe.    Popular error, and old writers, describe the badger as having his legs  shorter on one side than the other, and the latter, with philosophical  ingenuity, have discovered therein a wonderful provision of nature; for,  says Nicholas Cox, \"He hath very sharp Teeth, and therefore is accounted  a deep-biting beast; his back is broad, and his legs are longer on the  right side than the left, and therefore he runneth best when he gets on  the side of an Hill or a Cart roadway.\" The same author also  states--\"Her manner is to fight on her back, using thereby both her  Teeth and her Nails, and by blowing up her Skin after a strange and  wonderful manner she defendeth herself against any blow and teeth of  Dogs. Only a small stroke on her Nose will dispatch her presently. You  may thrash your heart weary on her back, which she values as a matter of  nothing.\" If such a provision in the matter of legs did exist, one can  realize the comfort of the uneven legs on a hill-side, but what gravels  us is the discomfort of the return journey! The rolling, shambling gait  that characterizes the badger is doubtless the origin of this absurd  theory, which might be equally applied to any other member of the bear  family. The European badger, as we find him in England, Wales, Scotland,  and Ireland, stands about ten to twelve inches from the ground, has a  long, stout body, with the belly near the earth. He has a coat so long  and dense, and legs so short, that he appears to travel very nearly  _ventre a terre_. The male is somewhat larger than the female, and  weighs more. The weight of a male is about 25 lbs., that of a female  about 22 lbs. When they are fat, or in grease in September, they will  scale more. Badgers have been known to weigh up to about 40 lbs.; the  largest I ever dug out and weighed was an old lean dog badger that  scaled over 35 lbs.    The head of the badger is wedge-shaped in general conformation, the back  of the head large, the cheek-bones well sprung, and the muzzle fine and  long. The nose or snout is black in colour, long and full; the eyes  small, black, or black-blue; and the ears small, round, close-set, and  neat. The strength of a badger's legs is most remarkable, and for his  size (the animal only weighs from 19 lbs. to 35 lbs.) he possesses a  most wonderful combination of bone and muscle. The legs are very short  and the joints large; the feet, like the legs, are nearly black, and are  large and long. The badger is a plantigrade, that is, when travelling he  puts down the whole of his foot, including the heel, flat on the ground.  His fore-feet are larger, longer, and better equipped for digging than  his hind, but all are armed with long, sharp claws, and it is prodigious  what he can effect with them. There is no mistaking his tracks--no  animal's footprint is in the least like his. His heel is large and wide;  this, and his four round, plump toes, leave an impression in sand, mud,  or snow that cannot be confounded with any other. If the mud is deep, or  there is snow on the ground, he also leaves the mark of his claws, but  as a rule these are not observable, as he puts his weight on the sole of  his foot--his tracks are usually almost in a line. The badger is cut out  for a miner. His wedge-shaped head is capable of forcing a passage  through sand and soft strata, whilst his armour-tipped diggers are  worked by machinery that rivals in power the steam navvy; and whilst his  fore-feet are going like an engine, throwing stones, bits of rock, sand,  clay, and all that he comes in contact with between his fore-legs (which  are set wide apart, leaving plenty of room under the chest), his  powerful hams are working his hind-legs and feet like little demons,  throwing back all that the fore-feet throw under his belly. And this is  not all. His powerful jaw and teeth will cut, break, and tear all roots  that obstruct his passage onwards, and it is most entertaining to see  him going through earth, shale, and stone with the rapidity and  sustained energy of a machine. No one who has not seen it would credit  what one of these animals can do. I have often been defeated by their  being able to penetrate more quickly than even a gang of men with  pick-axe, spade, shovels, and crowbar could follow. And it is safe to  say that as long as a terrier is not up to the badger, the badger is not  only advancing quicker than the men (if his earth is on a hill-side),  but has also, in nine cases out of ten, barricaded his retreat and  scored a victory. I have known a badger, left for awhile by the terrier,  bore his way straight up out to daylight and escape. The badger is  covered with a thick, long-haired coat, which with a loose skin of  extraordinary density and toughness forms a complete and effective  armour. The hair on his head is short and smooth, and the sharp, clean  black-and-white markings of his head give a very pretty and effective  appearance to it. The general appearance in colour of a badger is a sort  of silvery-grey, turning to black on the throat, breast, belly, and  legs. Inverting the usual colouring of other animals, which is generally  dark on the back, with lighter colouring on the belly and under the arms  and thighs, the badger is lighter on the back and black underneath. Not  only is this colouring peculiar to the badger, but his hair is unlike  that of any other creature known to me, being light at the root and  darker above.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The colour of a badger alters with age. The little cubs, till they are  seven or eight months old, are a clean, bright, light silvery-grey; they  then become yellower in their coats, a colour which they keep sometimes  permanently, but which they generally change after two years for a suit  of darker, purer grey. The badger's tail is about five inches long,  covered with long, coarse, lighter-coloured hair than that on his body,  and is of a yellowish-brown colour.    The badger has another peculiar distinction that is somewhat mysterious,  viz. a pouch, the vent of which is close under the root of the tail,  and contains an oily foetid matter which he has the power of emitting.  Different uses have been ascribed to this provision, such as that which  ferrets and polecats have. I have never noticed a badger use it as has  been suggested, as a mode of defence or annoyance, and am sure that this  is not its purpose. But there is no doubt the badger sucks and licks  this substance, whether by way of taking a tonic, a cooling draught, a  stimulant, or other physic I cannot say. I am, however, inclined to  believe, that from this source he is able to maintain his health and  support"]]]
