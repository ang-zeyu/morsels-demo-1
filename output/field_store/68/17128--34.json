Bombus, larva and nymph: after Packard.]  This stage corresponds to the chrysalis of a moth or butterfly, the  creature being shortened up and rather more like the perfect insect  compacted into the smallest form possible. People are often misled into the  idea that the caterpillar forms the chrysalis over its former self, whereas  the chrysalis has been all the time forming inside the caterpillar and only  shows itself when the final skin is shed; of course some caterpillars spin  a cocoon over themselves before they change their skin, but then the true  chrysalis is found inside the cocoon. A curious fact connected with the  change from the nymph to the perfect insect is that this takes place  sometimes as early as August in the year preceding their appearance; so  that cells dug up in August may contain fully fledged insects which are not  due to appear till April or May of the following year. It is wonderful also  how long life can be {12} sustained by these creatures in the \"full-fed  larva\" condition. Some years ago I collected a number of pierced bramble  stems in order to breed out some of the small \"sandwasps\" which nest in  them. On opening them in May, when the perfect insects are generally ready  to appear, I found that several of the larvae had rather shrunk up and had  not changed into nymphs. These I left in the stems, covering them up again,  and they appeared as perfect insects in the May of the following year.    The account given of the nesting habits of the above _Andrena_ of our  lawns, etc., is more or less true of nearly all the solitary bees. Their  methods vary, some burrow in the ground, some in old wood, some in snail  shells, some in bramble stems or straws or the hollow stems of various  plants, some in holes or crevices in walls, etc., and their methods of  building their cells vary exceedingly: all of these are of great interest  and some display an ingenuity which is quite surprising. Of these special  nesting habits some of the most striking will be mentioned later on.    Before leaving these general remarks on the {13} solitary bees the habits  of two genera must be specially noticed, as they differ in an essential  point from those of the others. These are known to entomologists under the  names of _Halictus_ and _Sphecodes_.    In most species of these the males and females of the new brood are not  hatched out till after midsummer, and no work is done for the provisioning  of new burrows that autumn; but the female, after having undertaken the  duties of maternity, hibernates, i.e. goes back into a burrow and lives  there till the next spring, the males dying off before the winter. In the  spring the [female] wakes up and does the necessary work for the future  brood just as any ordinary spring bee would--but there are no attendant  males--the duties of that sex having been performed in the autumn. The  larvae contained in these burrows hatch out after midsummer and therefore  never spend a winter in the ground. In this respect they resemble the  social bees and wasps, about which more hereafter; in the meanwhile a few  words must be said about the cuckoos or inquilines, which are perhaps the  most interesting creatures of all.           *       *       *       *       *    {14}    THE CUCKOO BEES    These cuckoos live at the expense of their hosts. The mother of the  industrial brood makes her cell and provisions it, and lays her egg. The  cuckoo bee manages to enter also and lay her egg in the same cell, the  usual result being that the cuckoo devours most of the food instead of the  rightful offspring, which gradually gets starved and dies, the cuckoo  appearing in its place; but there have been cases, how frequent they are is  difficult to say, in which both offsprings have emerged.    The whole problem of the relationships between host and cuckoo is most  interesting. In some cases the cuckoos are so like their hosts that it is  difficult to tell one from the other, in others they are so unlike that it  is difficult to trace any resemblance between them. There are a great  number of different kinds of cuckoos, and most of them select a special  host to associate {15} with, and are never found except with that species.  There are, however, cases of cuckoos which visit the nests of more than one  host, and cases of hosts which are visited by several kinds of cuckoos. In  the short-tongued bees, with the exception of _Halictus_ and _Sphecodes_,  the cuckoos are quite unlike their hosts both in form and colour. In the  _Andrenas_ (the lawn bee being one of them) the hosts are clothed with  reddish, or brown and black, hairs, and are of a more or less stout build  (pl. B, 15, 16). The cuckoos are elegant in shape, almost devoid of hairs,  and most of them are striped with yellow or brown across the body so that  they present a wasp-like appearance (pl. B, 18). Species more unlike one  another than host and cuckoo one could hardly imagine; still this stranger  seems to get access to the nest of its host without opposition. In a colony  of _Andrena_ one may see the cuckoos (which rejoice in the name of _Nomada_  or wanderers) flying about among the females of the industrious bee, and no  alarm or concern appears to be felt by the latter. As we go up in the scale  of bees, i.e. towards the more specialized, and arrive at those with longer  tongues, the {16} cuckoos are found as a rule to resemble their hosts more  closely, both in colour and structure, and when we reach the social genus  _Bombus_ (i.e. the humble bees) we find the cuckoos so like their hosts  (pl. D, 30, 31) that even entomologists of experience mistake one for the  other. _Apis_ (the hive bee) has no cuckoo. It seems to be theoretically  probable that both cuckoo and host once originated from common parents;  this is suggested by the similarity of structure of certain parts of both  host and cuckoo, even in cases where they are otherwise most dissimilar.  _Andrena_ and _Nomada_, for instance, which are very unlike, as stated  above, agree in both having very feeble stings and in possessing three  conspicuous spines on the upper and posterior edge of the orbit of the  larva. Also, although _Andrena_ the host has a short tongue, and _Nomada_,  its cuckoo, a long one, the appendages (_labial palpi_) of the latter's  tongue are framed on the same plan as those of the tongue of _Andrena_, and  are quite unlike those of the other long-tongued bees. On the other hand,  the cuckoos of the social species resemble them so closely in structure as  well as {17} appearance that it is more necessary to search for points of  difference than of similarity. There is only one case known of a cuckoo  wasp, and that resembles its host even more closely than do the cuckoos of  the humble bees. All these points certainly suggest the probability that  the social bees and wasps and their cuckoos adopted different habits at a  much more recent date than the solitary species, and therefore have not had  so much time to become differentiated in structure. The only short-tongued  bees which have cuckoos of similar structure are the species of _Halictus_  (pl. B, 12); their cuckoos, _Sphecodes_ (pl. B, 11), are closely allied to  them, but then _Halictus_ and _Sphecodes_ are most peculiar genera;  although short-tongued, their females spend the winter in the earth, as do  the social bees and wasps (see p. 13), and they colonize largely, which may  prove to be a step towards socialism.           *       *       *       *       *    {18}    THE FOSSORS OR DIGGERS    In many respects the insects of this section adopt the same methods as the  solitary bees so far as the construction of their nests is concerned, but  the food brought home for their offspring is animal instead of vegetable.  In order to supply their larvae with \"fresh meat\" these little creatures,  when they have captured a suitable prey, sting it in such a way that it  becomes paralyzed, but does not die; after provisioning a cell with the  necessary number of these paralytics, the mother lays her egg on one of  them or amongst them, and closes up the cell. In consequence of this  wonderful maternal instinct, foresight, or whatever the faculty may be, the  larva when hatched finds fresh food ready for consumption. The various  species provision their nests with different kinds of foods, and some  appear to be most fastidious in their selection, and are said never to err  in choosing {19} species of some particular family, thereby displaying a  discernment worthy of any advanced entomologist. Some provision their cells  with beetles, some with grasshoppers, others with spiders, caterpillars,  plant lice, etc.    The strength possessed by the female fossor must be proportionately  enormous, as she can bring back to her burrow, after paralyzing them,  insects many times her own size. It is a most interesting sight to see the  excitement and flurry of the captor as it tries to drag along some huge  prey to its nest. I remember seeing one dragging along a good-sized  caterpillar, of a noctuid moth, over rather rough ground: the poor creature  had a difficult job; it had to go backwards itself, and pull the body of  the caterpillar, after it--its behaviour was very much like that of an ant  which has a large burden; at times it would loose its hold of it and try it  from some other quarter; however, by degrees, by pulling and tugging, the  prey was safely brought home, but the force expended must have been very  great. Many species, however, hunt insects of much smaller size than  themselves, and it is those which take a fancy to grasshoppers and {20}  caterpillars which seem to be the most doughty in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#3)"],[1," surface of the femur; the origin begins proximally  at a point near the insertion of the _m. iliacus_. The medial, bulkier  part of the muscle has a fleshy origin on the medial surface of the  lower one-third of the femur. The two parts fuse to some extent above  the points of insertion and insert on the medial edge of the head of  the tibia.    Action.--Rotates tibia anteriorly.    Comparison.--Two parts of this muscle variously fused; otherwise, no  significant differences in the species studied.      _+Musculus piriformis+_ (Fig. 3).--This muscle is represented by the  _pars caudifemoralis_ only, the _pars iliofemoralis_ being absent in  passerine birds as far as is known. The _pars caudifemoralis_ is flat,  somewhat spindle-shaped, and passes anteroventrally from the pygostyle  to the femur. The origin is tendinous from the anteroventral edge of  the pygostyle, and the insertion is semitendinous on the  posterolateral surface of the shaft of the femur about one-fourth its  length from the proximal end.    Action.--Moves femur posteriorly and rotates it in this direction;  moves tail laterally and depresses it.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus semitendinosus+_ (Figs. 2, 3, 5).--The origin from the  extreme posterior edge of the posterior iliac crest of the ilium is  fleshy and is aponeurotic from the last vertebra of the synsacrum and  the transverse processes of several caudal vertebrae. The straplike  belly passes along the posterolateral margin of the thigh. Immediately  posterior to the knee, the muscle is divided transversely by a  ligament. That portion passing anteriorly from the ligament is the _m.  accessorius semitendinosi_ (here considered a part of the _m.  semitendinosus_) and is discussed below. The ligament continues  distally in two parts; one part inserts on the medial surface of the  _pars media_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ and the other part fuses with  the tendon of insertion of the _m. semimembranosus_.    The _m. accessorius semitendinosi_ extends anteriorly from the above  mentioned ligament to a fleshy insertion on the posterolateral surface  of the femur immediately proximal to the condyles.    Action.--Moves femur posteriorly, flexes the crus and aids in  extending the tarsometatarsus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus semimembranosus+_ (Figs. 3, 4, 5).--This straplike muscle  passes along the posteromedial surface of the thigh. The origin is  semitendinous along a line on the ischium, from a point dorsal to the  middle of the ischiopubic fenestra to the posterior end of the  ischium, and from a small area of the abdominal musculature posterior  to the ischium. The insertion is by means of a broad, thin tendon on a  ridge on the medial surface of the tibia immediately distal to the  head of this bone. The tendon of insertion passes between the head of  the _pars media_ and _pars interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ and is  fused with the tendon of the _m. semitendinosus_.    Action.--Flexes crus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus biceps femoris+_ (Fig. 2).--Long, thin, and somewhat  triangular, this muscle lies on the lateral side of the thigh just  underneath the _m. iliotibialis_. Its origin is from a line along the  anterior and posterior iliac crests underneath the origin of the _m.  iliotibialis_. Anterior to the acetabulum the origin is aponeurotic,  and the edge of this aponeurosis passes over the proximal end of the  femur. The origin posterior to the acetabulum is fleshy. The most  anterior point of origin is difficult to ascertain but it lies near  the center of the anterior iliac crest. The most posterior point of  origin is immediately dorsal to the posterior end of the ilioischiatic  fenestra. Behind the knee the fibers of this muscle converge to form  the strong tendon of insertion which passes through the biceps loop,  under the tendon of origin of the _m. flexor perforatus digiti II_,  and inserts on a small tubercle on the posterolateral edge of the  fibula at the point of the tibia-fibula fusion.    The biceps loop is tendinous and the distal end attaches to a  protuberance on the posterolateral edge of the femur at the proximal  edge of the external condyle. The proximal end attaches to the  anterolateral edge of the femur immediately proximal to the distal end  of the loop, which extends posterior to the femur. The distal arm of  this loop is connected with the tendon of origin of the _m. flexor  perforatus digiti II_ by a strong tendon.    Action.--Flexes crus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus ischiofemoralis+_ (Fig. 3).--Short and thick, this muscle  arises directly from the lateral surface of the ischium between the  posterior iliac crest and the ischiopubic fenestra. The area of origin  extends to the posterior edge of the ischium. The insertion is  tendinous on the lateral surface of the trochanter opposite the  insertion of the _m. iliotrochantericus medius_.    Action.--Moves femur posteriorly and rotates it in this direction.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus obturator internus+_ (Figs. 4, 7).--Lying on the inside of  the pelvis and covering the medial surface of the ischiopubic  fenestra, is this flat, pinnate, leaf-shaped muscle. The origin is  fleshy and is from the ischium and pubis around the edges of this  fenestra; none of the fibers arises from the membrane stretched across  the fenestra. Anteriorly the fibers converge and form a strong tendon  that passes through the obturator foramen and inserts on the  posterolateral surface of the trochanter of the femur.    Action.--Rotates femur posteriorly.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus obturator externus+_ (Fig. 7).--Short and fleshy, this  muscle consists of two parts which are not easily separable but which  may be traced throughout its length. The parts are more nearly  distinct at the origin. The dorsal part arises directly from the  ischium along the dorsal edge of the obturator foramen. The larger  ventral part arises directly from the anterior and ventral edges of  the obturator foramen. The fibers of the dorsal part pass anteriorly,  cover the tendon of the _m. obturator internus_ laterally, and insert  on the trochanter around the point of insertion of the latter muscle.  The fibers of the ventral part pass parallel with the tendon of the  _m. obturator internus_ and insert on the trochanter immediately  distal and posterior to the tendon of the latter muscle.    Action.--Rotates femur posteriorly.    Comparison.--In _Passer_, _Estrilda_, _Poephila_, _Hesperiphona_,  _Carpodacus_, _Pinicola_, _Leucosticte_, _Spinus_ and _Loxia_, this  muscle is undivided and, in its position, origin, and insertion,  resembles the ventral part of the bipartite muscle described above.  The origin is from the anterior and ventral edges of the obturator  foramen and the insertion is on the trochanter of the femur  immediately distal and posterior to the insertion of the _m. obturator  internus_. In all other genera examined, the muscle is bipartite. In  _Chlorura_ the dorsal part is larger and better developed than it is  in the other genera.      _+Musculus adductor longus et brevis+_ (Figs. 3, 4, 5).--Consisting of  two distinct, straplike parts, this large muscle lies on the medial  surface of the thigh, posterior to the femur.    The _pars anticus_ has a semitendinous origin on a line that extends  posteriorly from the posteroventral edge of the obturator foramen to a  point half way across the membrane that covers the ischiopubic  fenestra. The insertion is fleshy along the posterior surface of the  femur from the level of the insertion of the _m. piriformis_ distally  to the medial surface of the internal condyle.    The _pars posticus_ originates by a broad, flat tendon on a line  across the posterior half of the membrane that covers the ischiopubic  fenestra. The insertion is at the point of origin of the _pars media_  of the _m. gastrocnemius_ on the posteromedial surface of the proximal  end of the internal condyle of the femur. There is a broad tendinous  connection with the proximal end of the _pars media_ of the _m.  gastrocnemius_. The anterior edge of the _pars posticus_ is overlapped  medially by the posterior edge of the _pars anticus_.    Action.--Flexes thigh; may flex crus also and may extend  tarsometatarsus.    Comparison.--In _Vireo olivaceous_, the origin of this muscle does not  extend the length of the ischiopubic fenestra. The origin,  furthermore, is along the dorsal edge of the ischiopubic fenestra and  not from the membrane covering the fenestra. Finally, in this species,  the origin of the _pars posticus_ is fleshy.      _+Musculus tibialis anticus+_ (Figs. 2, 5).--Lying along the anterior  edge of the crus, a part of this muscle is covered by the _m. peroneus  longus_. The origin is by two distinct heads, each of which is  pinnate. The anterior head arises directly from the edges of the outer  and inner cnemial crests. The posterior head arises by a short, strong  tendon from a small pit on the anterodistal edge of the external  condyle of the femur. This tendon and the proximal end of the muscle  pass between the head of the fibula and the outer cnemial crest. The  two heads of the muscle fuse at a place slightly more than one-half of  the distance down the crus. At the distal end of the crus this muscle  gives rise to a strong tendon which passes under a fibrous loop  immediately proximal to the external condyle in company with the _m.  extensor digitorum longus_ and which passes between the condyles of  the tibia and inserts on a tubercle on the anteromedial edge of the  proximal end of the tarsometatarsus.    Action.--Flexes"]]]
