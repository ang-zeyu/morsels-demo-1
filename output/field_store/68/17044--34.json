EPOPS How so?    PISTHETAERUS The air is 'twixt earth and heaven. When we want to go to  Delphi, we ask the Boeotians(1) for leave of passage; in the same way,  when men sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you  exercise the right of every nation towards strangers and don't allow the  smoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory.    f(1) Boeotia separated Attica from Phocis.    EPOPS By earth! by snares! by network!(1) I never heard of anything more  cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going to build  the city along with you.    f(1) He swears by the powers that are to him dreadful.    PISTHETAERUS Who will explain the matter to them?    EPOPS You must yourself. Before I came they were quite ignorant, but  since I have lived with them I have taught them to speak.    PISTHETAERUS But how can they be gathered together?    EPOPS Easily. I will hasten down to the coppice to waken my dear  Procne!(1) as soon as they hear our voices, they will come to us hot  wing.    f(1) As already stated, according to the legend accepted by  Aristophanes, it was Procne who was turned into the nightengale.    PISTHETAERUS My dear bird, lose no time, I beg. Fly at once into the  coppice and awaken Procne.    EPOPS Chase off drowsy sleep, dear companion. Let the sacred hymn gush  from thy divine throat in melodious strains; roll forth in soft cadence  your refreshing melodies to bewail the fate of Itys,(1) which has been  the cause of so many tears to us both. Your pure notes rise through  the thick leaves of the yew-tree right up to the throne of Zeus, where  Phoebus listens to you, Phoebus with his golden hair. And his ivory lyre  responds to your plaintive accents; he gathers the choir of the gods and  from their immortal lips rushes a sacred chant of blessed voices. (THE  FLUTE IS PLAYED BEHIND THE SCENE.)    f(1) The son of Tereus and Procne.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! by Zeus! what a throat that little bird possesses. He  has filled the whole coppice with honey-sweet melody!    EUELPIDES Hush!    PISTHETAERUS What's the matter?    EUELPIDES Will you keep silence?    PISTHETAERUS What for?    EUELPIDES Epops is going to sing again.    EPOPS (IN THE COPPICE) Epopoi poi popoi, epopoi, popoi, here, here,  quick, quick, quick, my comrades in the air; all you who pillage the  fertile lands of the husbandmen, the numberless tribes who gather and  devour the barley seeds, the swift flying race who sing so sweetly. And  you whose gentle twitter resounds through the fields with the little  cry of tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio; and you who hop about the  branches of the ivy in the gardens; the mountain birds, who feed on the  wild olive berries or the arbutus, hurry to come at my call, trioto,  trioto, totobrix; you also, who snap up the sharp-stinging gnats in the  marshy vales, and you who dwell in the fine plain of Marathon, all  damp with dew, and you, the francolin with speckled wings; you too, the  halcyons, who flit over the swelling waves of the sea, come hither to  hear the tidings; let all the tribes of long-necked birds assemble here;  know that a clever old man has come to us, bringing an entirely new  idea and proposing great reforms. Let all come to the debate here,  here, here, here. Torotorotorotorotix, kikkobau, kikkobau,  torotorotorotorolililix.    PISTHETAERUS Can you see any bird?    EUELPIDES By Phoebus, no! and yet I am straining my eyesight to scan the  sky.    PISTHETAERUS 'Twas really not worth Epops' while to go and bury himself  in the thicket like a plover when a-hatching.    PHOENICOPTERUS Torotina, torotina.    PISTHETAERUS Hold, friend, here is another bird.    EUELPIDES I' faith, yes, 'tis a bird, but of what kind? Isn't it a  peacock?    PISTHETAERUS Epops will tell us. What is this bird?    EPOPS 'Tis not one of those you are used to seeing; 'tis a bird from the  marshes.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! oh! but he is very handsome with his wings as crimson  as flame.    EPOPS Undoubtedly; indeed he is called flamingo.(1)    f(1) An African bird, that comes to the southern countries of Europe, to  Greece, Italy, and Spain; it is even seen in Provence.    EUELPIDES Hi! I say! You!    PISTHETAERUS What are you shouting for?    EUELPIDES Why, here's another bird.    PISTHETAERUS Aye, indeed; 'tis a foreign bird too. What is this bird  from beyond the mountains with a look as solemn as it is stupid?    EPOPS He is called the Mede.(1)    f(1) Aristophanes amusingly mixes up real birds with people and  individuals, whom he represents in the form of birds; he is personifying  the Medians here.    PISTHETAERUS The Mede! But, by Heracles, how, if a Mede, has he flown  here without a camel?    EUELPIDES Here's another bird with a crest.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! that's curious. I say, Epops, you are not the only one  of your kind then?    EPOPS This bird is the son of Philocles, who is the son of Epops;(1)  so that, you see, I am his grandfather; just as one might say,  Hipponicus,(2) the son of Callias, who is the son of Hipponicus.    f(1) Philocles, a tragic poet, had written a tragedy on Tereus, which  was simply a plagiarism of the play of the same name by Sophocles.  Philocles is the son of Epops, because he got his inspiration from  Sophocles' Tereus, and at the same time is father to Epops, since he  himself produced another Tereus.    f(2) This Hipponicus is probably the orator whose ears Alcibiades boxed  to gain a bet; he was a descendant of Callias, who was famous for his  hatred of Pisistratus.    PISTHETAERUS Then this bird is Callias! Why, what a lot of his feathers  he has lost!(1)    f(1) This Callias, who must not be confounded with the foe of  Pisistratus, had ruined himself.    EPOPS That's because he is honest; so the informers set upon him and the  women too pluck out his feathers.    PISTHETAERUS By Posidon, do you see that many-coloured bird? What is his  name?    EPOPS This one? 'Tis the glutton.    PISTHETAERUS Is there another glutton besides Cleonymus? But why, if  he is Cleonymus, has he not thrown away his crest?(1) But what is the  meaning of all these crests? Have these birds come to contend for the  double stadium prize?(2)    f(1) Cleonymus had cast away his shield; he was as great a glutton as he  was a coward.    f(2) A race in which the track had to be circled twice.    EPOPS They are like the Carians, who cling to the crests of their  mountains for greater safety.(1)    f(1) A people of Asia Minor; when pursued by the Ionians they took  refuge in the mountains.    PISTHETAERUS Oh, Posidon! do you see what swarms of birds are gathering  here?    EUELPIDES By Phoebus! what a cloud! The entrance to the stage is no  longer visible, so closely do they fly together.    PISTHETAERUS Here is the partridge.    EUELPIDES Faith! there is the francolin.    PISTHETAERUS There is the poachard.    EUELPIDES Here is the kingfisher. And over yonder?    EPOPS 'Tis the barber.    EUELPIDES What? a bird a barber?    PISTHETAERUS Why, Sporgilus is one.(1) Here comes the owl.    f(1) An Athenian barber.    EUELPIDES And who is it brings an owl to Athens?(1)    f(1) The owl was dedicated to Athene, and being respected at Athens,  it had greatly multiplied. Hence the proverb, 'taking owls to Athens,'  similar to our English 'taking coals to Newcastle.'    PISTHETAERUS Here is the magpie, the turtle-dove, the swallow, the  horned owl, the buzzard, the pigeon, the falcon, the ring-dove, the  cuckoo, the red-foot, the red-cap, the purple-cap, the kestrel, the  diver, the ousel, the osprey, the woodpecker.    EUELPIDES Oh! oh! what a lot of birds! what a quantity of blackbirds!  how they scold, how they come rushing up! What a noise! what a noise!  Can they be bearing us ill-will? Oh! there! there! they are opening  their beaks and staring at us.    PISTHETAERUS Why, so they are.    CHORUS Popopopopopopopoi. Where is he who called me? Where am I to find  him?    EPOPS I have been waiting for you this long while! I never fail in my  word to my friends.    CHORUS Titititititititi. What good thing have you to tell me?    EPOPS Something that concerns our common safety, and that is just as  pleasant as it is to the purpose. Two men, who are subtle reasoners,  have come here to seek me.    CHORUS Where? What? What are you saying?    EPOPS I say, two old men have come from the abode of men to propose a  vast and splendid scheme to us.    CHORUS Oh! 'tis a horrible, unheard-of crime! What are you saying?    EPOPS Nay! never let my words scare you.    CHORUS What have you done then?    EPOPS I have welcomed two men, who wish to live with us.    CHORUS And you have dared to do that!    EPOPS Aye, and am delighted at having done so.    CHORUS Where are they?    EPOPS In your midst, as I am.    CHORUS Ah! ah! we are betrayed; 'tis sacrilege! Our friend, he who  picked up corn-seeds in the same plains as ourselves, has violated our  ancient laws; he has broken the oaths that bind all birds; he has laid a  snare for me, he has handed us over to the attacks of that impious race  which, throughout all time, has never ceased to war against us. As for  this traitorous bird, we will decide his case later, but the two old men  shall be punished forthwith; we are going to tear them to pieces.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis all over with us.    EUELPIDES You are the sole cause of all our trouble. Why did you bring  me from down yonder?    PISTHETAERUS To have you with me.    EUELPIDES Say rather to have me melt into tears.    PISTHETAERUS Go to! you are talking nonsense.    EUELPIDES How so?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30181"],[0,"Fungi: Their Nature and Uses (#3)"],[1," long known as  _Eurotium_). From what is now known of the polymorphism of fungi, there  would be little difficulty in believing that cells resembling yeast  cells would develop into _Penicillium_, as they do in _fact_ in what is  called the \"vinegar plant,\" and that the capsuliferous, or higher  condition of this mould may be a _Mucor_, in which the sporules are  produced in capsules. The difficulty arises earlier, in the supposed  spontaneous origination of yeast cells from molecules, which result from  the peculiar conditions of light, temperature, &c., in which certain  solutions are placed. It would be impossible to review all the  arguments, or tabulate all the experiments, which have been employed  for and against this theory. It could not be passed over in silence,  since it has been one of the stirring questions of the day. The great  problem how to exclude all germs from the solutions experimented  upon, and to keep them excluded, lies at the foundation of the theory.  It must ever, as we think, be matter of doubt that all germs were not  excluded or destroyed, rather than one of belief that forms known to be  developed day by day from germs should under other conditions  originate spontaneously.    Fungi are veritably and unmistakably plants, of a low organization, it  is true, but still plants, developed from germs, somewhat analogous,  but not wholly homologous, to the seeds of higher orders. The process  of fertilization is still obscure, but facts are slowly and gradually  accumulating, so that we may hope at some not very distant period to  comprehend what as yet are little removed from hypotheses. Admitting  that fungi are independent plants, much more complex in their  relations and development than was formerly supposed, it will be  expected that certain forms should be comparatively permanent, that  is, that they should constitute good species. Here, also, efforts have  been made to develop a theory that there are no legitimate species  amongst fungi, accepting the terms as hitherto applied to flowering  plants. In this, as in allied instances, too hasty generalizations  have been based on a few isolated facts, without due comprehension of  the true interpretation of such facts and phenomena. Polymorphism will  hereafter receive special illustration, but meantime it may be well to  state that, because some forms of fungi which have been described, and  which have borne distinct names as autonomous species, are now proved  to be only stages or conditions of other species, there is no reason  for concluding that no forms are autonomous, or that fungi which  appear and are developed in successive stages are not, in their  entirety, good species. Instead, therefore, of insinuating that there  are no good species, modern investigation tends rather to the  establishment of good species, and the elimination of those that are  spurious. It is chiefly amongst the microscopic species that  polymorphism has been determined. In the larger and fleshy fungi  nothing has been discovered which can shake our faith in the species  described half a century, or more, ago. In the Agarics, for instance,  the forms seem to be as permanent and as distinct as in the flowering  plants. In fact, there is still no reason to dissent, except to a very  limited extent, from what was written before polymorphism was  accredited, that, \"with a few exceptions only, it may without doubt be  asserted that more certain species do not exist in any part of the  organized world than amongst fungi. The same species constantly recur  in the same places, and if kinds not hitherto detected present  themselves, they are either such as are well known in other districts,  or species which have been overlooked, and which are found on better  experience to be widely diffused. There is nothing like chance about  their characters or growth.\"[F]    The parasitism of numerous minute species on living and growing plants  has its parallel even amongst phanerogams in the mistletoe and  broom-rape and similar species. Amongst fungi a large number are thus  parasitic, distorting, and in many cases ultimately destroying, their  host, burrowing within the tissues, and causing rust and smut in corn  and grasses, or even more destructive and injurious in such moulds as  those of the potato disease and its allies. A still larger number of  fungi are developed from decayed or decaying vegetable matter. These  are found in winter on dead leaves, twigs, branches, rotten wood, the  remains of herbaceous plants, and soil largely charged with  disintegrated vegetables. As soon as a plant begins to decay it  becomes the source of a new vegetation, which hastens its destruction,  and a new cycle of life commences. In these instances, whether  parasitic on living plants or developed on dead ones, the source is  still vegetable. But this is not always the case, so that it cannot be  predicated that fungi are wholly epiphytal. Some species are always  found on animal matter, leather, horn, bone, &c., and some affect such  unpromising substances as minerals, from which it would be supposed  that no nourishment could be obtained, not only hard gravel stones,  fragments of rock, but also metals, such as iron and lead, of which  more may be said when we come to treat of the habitats of fungi.  Although in general terms fungi may be described as \"hysterophytal or  epiphytal mycetals deriving nourishment by means of a mycelium from  the matrix,\"[G] there are exceptions to this rule with which the  majority accord.    Of the fungi found on animal substances, none are more extraordinary  than those species which attack insects. The white mould which in  autumn proves so destructive to the common house-fly may for the  present be omitted, as it is probably a condition of one of the  _Saprolegniei_, which some authors include with fungi, and others with  algae. Wasps, spiders, moths, and butterflies become enveloped in a  kind of mould named _Isaria_, which constitutes the conidia of  _Torrubia_, a genus of club-shaped _Sphaeriae_ afterwards developed.  Some species of _Isaria_ and _Torrubia_ also affect the larvae and pupae  of moths and butterflies, converting the whole interior into a mass of  mycelium, and fructifying in a clavate head. It has been subject for  discussion whether in such instances the fungus commenced its  development during the life of the insect, and thus hastened its  death, or whether it resulted after death, and was subsequent to the  commencement of decay.[H] The position in which certain large moths  are found standing on leaves when infested with _Isaria_ resembles so  closely that of the house-fly when succumbing to _Sporendonema Muscae_,  would lead to the conclusion that certainly in some cases the insect  was attacked by the fungus whilst still living; whilst in the case of  buried caterpillars, such as the New Zealand or British _Hepialus_, it  is difficult to decide. Whether in life or death in these instances,  it is clear that the silk-worm disease _Muscardine_ attacks the living  insect, and causes death. In the case of the _Guepes vegetantes_, the  wasp is said to fly about with the fungus partially developed.    In all fungi we may recognize a vegetative and a reproductive system:  sometimes the first only becomes developed, and then the fungus is  imperfect, and sometimes the latter is far more prominent than the  former. There is usually an agglomeration of delicate threads,  either jointed or not, which are somewhat analogous to the roots of  higher plants. These delicate threads permeate the tissues of  plants attacked by parasitic fungi, or they run over dead leaves  forming whitened patches, formerly bearing the name of _Himantia_,  but really the mycelium of some species of _Marasmius_. If checked  or disturbed, the process stops here, and only a mycelium of  interwoven threads is produced. In this condition the mycelium of one  species so much resembles that of another, that no accurate  determination can be made. If the process goes on, this mycelium gives  rise to the stem and cap of an agaricoid fungus, completing the  vegetative system. This in turn gives origin to a spore-bearing  surface, and ultimately the fruit is formed, and then the fungus is  complete; no fungus can be regarded as perfect or complete without  its reproductive system being developed. In some this is very  simple, in others it is as complex. In many of the moulds we have  miniature representatives of higher plants in the mycelium or  roots, stem, branches, and at length capsules bearing sporidia, which  correspond to seeds. It is true that leaves are absent, but these are  sometimes compensated by lateral processes or abortive branchlets.  A tuft of mould is in miniature a forest of trees. Although such a  definition may be deemed more poetic than accurate, more figurative  than literal, yet few could believe in the marvellous beauty of a  tuft of mould if they never saw it as exhibited under the microscope.  In such a condition no doubt could be entertained of its vegetable  character. But there is a lower phase in which these plants are  sometimes encountered; they may consist only of single cells, or  strings of cells, or threads of simple structure floating in  fluids. In such conditions only the vegetative system is probably  developed, and that imperfectly, yet some have ventured to give  names to isolated cells, or strings of cells, or threads of  mycelium, which really in themselves possess none of the elements  of correct classification--the vegetative system, even, being  imperfect, and consequently the reproductive is absent. As already  observed, no fungus is perfect without fruit of some kind, and the  peculiarities of structure and development of fruit form one of the  most important elements in classification. To attempt, therefore, to  give names to such imperfect fragments of undeveloped plants is  almost as absurd as to name a"]]]
