Soon we became aware of two teams coming to meet us; then three horsemen  behind, emerging from the pine-ridge we had left.  As the horsemen  gradually decreased their distance, the teams met and passed us  without salutation; sullenly drawing off the track, in the deference  always conceded to wool.  Victorian poverty spoke in every detail  of the working plant; Victorian energy and greed in the unmerciful loads  of salt and wire, for the scrub country out back.  The Victorian carrier,  formidable by his lack of professional etiquette and his extreme thrift,  is neither admired nor caressed by the somewhat select practitioners  of Riverina.    Then the three horsemen overtook Cooper, pausing a little,  after the custom of the country, to gossip with him as they passed.  According to another custom of the country, Thompson, Willoughby and I  began to criticise them.    \"I know the bloke with the linen coat,\" remarked Thompson.  \"His name's M'Nab; he's a contractor.  That half-caste has been with him  for years, tailing horses and so forth, for his tucker and rags.  Mac's no great chop.\"    \"He lets his man Friday have the best horse, at all events,\" said I.  \"Grand-looking beast, that black one the half-caste is riding.\"    \"By Jove, yes,\" replied Willoughby.  \"Now, Thompson--referring to  the discussion we had this morning--that is the class of horse we mount  in our light cavalry.\"    \"And that strapping red-headed galoot, riding the bag of bones beside him,  is what you would call excellent war-material?\" I suggested.    \"Precisely, Mr. Collins,\" replied the whaler.  \"Nature produces such men  expressly for rank and file; and I should imagine that their existence  furnishes sufficient rejoinder to the levelling theory.\"    \"Quite possible the chap's as good as either of you,\" remarked Thompson,  seizing the opportunity for reproof.  \"Do you know anything against him?\"    \"Well, to quote Madame de Staël,\" replied Willoughby;  \"he abuses a man's privilege of being ugly.\"    \"Moreover, he has left undone a thing that he ought to have done,\" I rejoined.  \"He ought to be taking a spell of carrying that mare.  And pat he comes,  like the catastrophe of the old comedy\"...    \"'Day, chaps,\" said Rufus, as he joined us.  \"Keep on your pins, you beggar\"--  and he drove both spurs into his mare's shrinking flanks.  \"Grey mare belongs to you, boss--don't she?--an' the black moke  with the Roman nose follerin'?  I was thinkin' we might manage  to knock up some sort o' swap.  Now this mare's a Patriarch, she is;  and you might n't think it.  I won this here saddle with her  at a bit of a meetin' las' week, an' rode her my own self--an' that's  oc'lar demonster.  I tell you, if this here mare had a week spell,  you could n't hold her; an' she'd go a hundred mile between sunrise an' sunset,  at the same bat.  Yes, boss; it's the breed does it.  I seen some good horses  about the King, but swelp me Gawd I never seen a patch on this mare;  an' you might n't think it to look at her jist now.  Fact is, boss,  she wants a week or a fortnit spell.  Could n't we work up  some sort o' swap for that ole black moke o' yours, with the big head?  If I got a trifle o' cash to boot, I would n't mind slingin' in this saddle,  an' takin' yours.  Now, boss, don't be a (adj.) fool.\"    \"To tell you the truth,\" I replied, \"that black horse has carried a pack  so long that he's about cooked for saddle.  But he does me right enough.\"    \"Then I'll tell you what I'll do!\" exclaimed Rufus impulsively.  \"Look here! At a word! I'll go you an even swap for that little weed  of a grey mare! At a word, mind! I'm a reckless sort o' (person)  when I take the notion! but without a word of exaggeration,  I would n't do it on'y for being fixed the way I am.  This here mare's got  a fortune in her for a man like you.\"    \"Now howl' yer tongue!\" interposed M'Nab, who, with the half-caste--a lithe,  active lad of eighteen--had joined us.  \"Is it swappin' ye want wi' decent men?  Sure thon poor craytur iv a baste hes n't got the sthrenth fur till kerry  it own hide, let alone a great gommeril on it back.  An' thon's furnent ye!  Hello, Tamson! begog A did n't know ye at wanst.\"    \"Good day, Mr. M'Nab.  Alterations since I delivered you that wire at Poondoo.  Been in the wars?\" For M'Nab was leaning forward and sideways in his saddle,  evidently in pain.    \"Yis,\" replied the contractor frankly.  \"There was some Irish rascals  at the pub. thonder, where we stapped las' night; an' wan word  brung on another, an' at long an' at last we fell to, so we did;  on' A'm dam but they got the betther o' me, being three agin wan.  A b'lee some o' me ribs is bruk.\"    \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" said Thompson, straining a point for courtesy.    \"Are you an Orangeman too, sonny?\" I asked the half-caste aside;  for the young fellow had a bunged eye, and a flake of skin off his cheek-bone.    \"No, by Cripes!\" responded my countryman emphatically.  \"Not me.  That cove's a (adj.) liar.  He don't give a dam, s'posin' a feller's soul  gits bashed out.  Best sight I seen for many a day was seein' him  gittin' kicked.  If the mean beggar'd on'y square up with me,  I'd let summedy else do his\"----    \"Thon's a brave wee shilty, sur-thon grey wan o' yours,\"  broke in the contractor, who had been conversing with Thompson,  whilst looking enviously at Fancy, hitched behind the wagon.  \"Boys o' dear,\"  he added reflectively, \"she's jist sich another as may wee Dolly;  an' A've been luckin' fur a match fur Dolly this menny's the day.  How oul' is she, sur?\"    \"Six, this spring.\"    \"Ay--that! Ye wud n't be fur partin' we her, sur?  A'm mortial covetious  fur till git thon baste.  Houl' an\"--he pondered a moment, glancing first  at the honest-looking hack he was riding, then at the magnificent animal  which carried the half-caste.  \"Houl' an.  Gimme a thrifle fur luck,  an' take ether wan o' them two.  A'll thrust ye till do the leck fur me  some time afther.\"    He had been travelling with the red-headed fellow, and the fascination  of swapping was upon him, poorly backed by his suicidal candour.  The utter simplicity of his bracketing his own two horses--worth,  respectively, to all appearance, £8 and £30--and the frank confession  of his desire to have my mare at any price, made me feel honestly compunctious.    \"Now thon's a brave loose lump iv a baste,\" he continued, following my eye  as I glanced over the half-caste's splendid mount.  \"Aisy till ketch,  an' as quite as ye plaze.\"    \"How old is he, Mr. M'Nab?\"    \"He must be purty oul', he's so quite and thractable.  Ye kin luck  at his mouth.  A don't ondherstand the marks myself.\"    I opened the horse's mouth.  He was just five.  I regret to record  that I shook my head gravely, and observed:    \"You've had him a long time, Mr. M'Nab?\"    \"Divil a long.  A got him in a swap, as it might be this time yistherday.  There's the resate.  An' here's the resate the man got when he bought him  out o' Hillston poun'.  Ye can't go beyant a poun' resate.\"    \"Why do you want to get rid of the horse, Mr. M'Nab?\"    \"Begog, A don't want till git red iv the baste, sich as he is,\"  replied M'Nab resentfully.  \"But A want thon wee shilty, an' A evened a swap  till ye, fur it's a prodistaner thing nor lavin' a man on his feet, so it is.\"    \"See anything wrong with the horse, Steve?\" I asked in an undertone.    \"Perfect to the eye,\" murmured Thompson.  \"Try him a mile, full tilt.\"    I made the proposal to M'Nab, and he eagerly agreed.  At my suggestion,  the half-caste unhitched and tried Fancy, while I mounted the black horse,  and turned him across the plain.  I tried him at all paces; but never before  had I met with anything to equal that elastic step and long, easy,  powerful stride.  To ride that horse was to feel free, exultant, invincible.  His gallop was like Marching Through Georgia, vigorously rendered  by a good brass band.  All that has been written of man's noblest friend--  from the dim, uncertain time when some unknown hand, in a leisure moment,  dashed off the Thirty-ninth chapter of the Book of Job, to the yesterday  when Long Gordon translated into ringing verse the rhythmic clatter  of the hoof-beats he loved so well--all might find fulfilment  in this unvalued beast, now providentially owned by the softest of foreigners.    \"Well?\" interrogated M'Nab, as I rejoined him.    \"Don't you think he's a bit chest-foundered?\" I asked in reply.    \"Divil a wan o' me knows.  Mebbe he is, begog.  Sure A hed n't him long enough  fur till fine out.\"    \"And how much boot are you going to give me?\" I asked, with a feeling of shame  which did honour to my heart.    \"Och, now, lave this! Boot! is it?  Sure A cud kerry thon wee shilty ondher  may oxther! Ye have a right till be givin' me a thrifle fur luck.  A'll let ye aff we two notes.\"    But after five minutes' more palaver, M'Nab agreed to an even swap.  I had pen and ink in my pocket; my note-book supplied paper;  and receipts were soon exchanged.  Then the saddles were shifted,  and we cantered ahead till we rejoined Thompson.  I tied my new acquisition  behind the wagon, where, for the first five minutes, he severely tested  the inch rope which secured him.    \"Now, Mr. M'Nab,\" said I, \"I'll give you my word that the mare  is just what you see.  You may as well tell me what's wrong with the horse?\"    \"Ax Billy about thon.  Mebbe he's foun' out some thricks, or somethin'.\"    \"Well, look here,\" said Billy devoutly--\"I hope Gord'll strike me stark,  stiff, stone dead off o' this saddle if the horse has any tricks,  or anythin' wrong with him, no more nor the man in the moon.  Onna bright.  There! I've swore it.\"    \"Well, the mare is as good as gold,\" I reiterated.  \"She's one among a hundred.  Call her Fancy.\"    \"The horse's name's Clayopathra,\" rejoined M'Nab; \"an' by gog ye'l"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#3)"],[1,"Arndt\" (Leipzig, 1861).  This author complains that he found it a difficult task to collect full  and authentic accounts of Arndt's life. Still, he obtained access to  various documents in the archives of the city of Brunswick, and in the  royal library in Dresden, which had not been previously examined even by  Arndt's best biographer, the Rev. Frederick Arndt, of Berlin; and these  materially assisted him in preparing his own work.(1)    § 11. During the earlier years of Arndt's residence in Brunswick, as a  co-pastor of the church of St. Martin, his life was comparatively peaceful  and happy. The purity of his character, the soundness and power of his  doctrine, and the diligence and fidelity manifested in his pastoral  labors, could not fail to command the respect, and attract the love of all  candid persons. But he was at length subjected to trials of a new and  painful character, and became the victim of the hostile and persecuting  spirit of men from whom a very different course of conduct might have  reasonably been expected. The origin of these new difficulties has not  always been clearly understood; while some have regarded Arndt as worthy  of the censures of those who assailed him, others are disposed to condemn  those assailants in unqualified terms. It is strange that, even at this  comparatively remote period, such judgments are sometimes expressed in  language which betrays personal feeling rather than it announces the calm  judgment of a later and disinterested generation.    § 12. It is here necessary to cast a glance at the history of the times  which preceded and followed the eventful year 1555, in which Arndt was  born, a year ever memorable as the one in which the signing of the  articles of the Peace of Augsburg secured a temporary external repose for  the Lutheran Church. This \"Peace\" terminated at least the horrors which  had followed the introduction, in 1548, of the _Augsburg Interim_, by  which the newly-established Protestant doctrine was seriously endangered.  The provisions of this _Interim_ were enforced with such merciless tyranny  by popish authorities, that in South Germany alone about four hundred  faithful Lutheran pastors, who could not conscientiously accede to an  arrangement which might possibly restore the full authority of the errors  and superstitions of Rome, were driven, as exiles, with their families,  from their homes. The spirit of the Christian martyrs of the early ages of  the Church revived in these heroic men, and they clung with undying  tenacity to their holy faith.    § 13. That faith now encountered new enemies, who did not resort to fire  and the sword, but who adopted more insidious means for corrupting divine  truth; and again, assaults like theirs, only increased the jealousy with  which the genuine Lutherans guarded the purity of their doctrinal system.  It was the only gift of heaven, which sin and Satan could not touch, and  which retained all its unsullied holiness. The soul of man had become  corrupt; the body was subject to disease and death; the world, fair as it  was, and rich in the gifts of God, had nevertheless been made by sin to  bring forth thorns and thistles. But the Gospel truth, which conducted men  to Christ and heaven, remained in all its purity and power. These men were  willing to suffer and die, but while they did live, they could not relax  the grasp with which they held fast to evangelical truth. Now, amid the  political and religious commotions of that stormy age, could we expect  that devout men should say, \"Peace, peace;\" when there was no peace?  (Jerem. 6:14.)    § 14. Let us illustrate this subject. Schwenkfeldt, for instance (born in  1490; died, 1561), an opponent of both the Lutherans and the Reformed, as  well as of the Papists, and, accordingly, constantly engaged in  controversies with all parties, declared that Luther's uncompromising  determination to maintain the authority of the written word of revelation,  the Bible, was equivalent to a worship of the letter. He assigned, in his  fanaticism and morbid mysticism, a rank to an inner and direct word of the  Divine Spirit, which he asserted that he received, far above that of the  written word of God. He refused to make any distinction between the divine  act of the justification of the believer, on the one hand, and the  progressive sanctification of the believer, on the other. He taught that  the two natures of Christ, the divine and the human, were so fused  together, or, rather, that the flesh of Christ was so absolutely deified  or converted into God himself, that no distinction between them  remained,--that the regenerate could live without sin, etc. He succeeded,  in spite of the crudeness, one-sidedness, and unsoundness of his  doctrines, in attracting many disciples. His death, which occurred in  1561, a few years after Arndt's birth, did not terminate the widespread  confusion which he had created in the Protestant Church; the dread of that  sickly form of mysticism which he attempted to establish, long remained.  The fear was naturally entertained that it might lead many astray, who,  while they did not otherwise fraternize with Schwenkfeldt in his wild and  absurd course, might be deluded by his claims to superior religious  intelligence and holiness.    § 15. The disastrous influences of the demagogue Thomas Muenzer (born in  1490), and of his fanatical party, the Zwickau prophets, on sound doctrine  and sound morals, as well as the blood which they had shed, were still  vividly remembered.--Servetus, the Unitarian, had perished, but he left a  seed behind; the doctrine of Christ's deity still remained a point of  attack. And besides these false teachers, several others, who were  originally connected in various modes with the Lutheran Church,  promulgated at various times opinions which seemed to be subversive of all  Scripture doctrine.--Agricola, who had originally been an active adherent  of Luther, gradually departed from the faith. He unquestionably betrayed  the interests of Protestantism by sanctioning the Augsburg Interim of  1548. He engaged in a controversy, at first with Melanchthon, and then  with Luther himself, on the subject of the proper \"Use of the law\"--the  Antinomistic controversy--maintaining that the law was no longer of  importance to the believer, and that the Gospel alone should be preached.  He died in 1566, when Arndt was about eleven years old. The confusion in  the church, which he created by his dangerous sentiments on several  points, was long painfully felt.--The Osiandrian controversy, respecting  Justification, and its relation to Sanctification, began in 1549, and  closed only when Arndt was already a student.--The Majoristic controversy  originated in the public declaration made by G. Major, that \"good works  are _necessary to salvation_.\" The fears which such a doctrine, that  savored of popery, produced among orthodox and devout Lutherans, were  excessive. Those who opposed Major, were alarmed by his unguarded  expressions, and apprehended that the Gospel doctrine of _Justification by  faith in Christ alone, without human works or merit_, would be endangered,  unless they silenced him. The controversy, in its most energetic form,  terminated about seven years after Arndt's birth, but the indirect effects  of the misconceptions connected with the great topic of this controversy,  were deeply felt by him.--The Synergistic controversy, relating to the  question whether man could co-operate with the Holy Spirit in the work of  his conversion, began in the year in which Arndt was born, and was  maintained with great energy during several years.--The so-called  Cryptocalvinistic controversy, referring mainly to the doctrine of the  Lord's Supper, and involving certain important questions respecting the  Person of Christ, commenced about three years before Arndt's birth, and  agitated the church during many years.--These, and other subjects on which  also controversies had arisen, were, in the good providence of God, at  length calmly considered by learned and devout Lutheran theologians,  conscientiously examined in the light of the divine Word, impartially  decided, and set forth, in the year 1580, in the FORMULA OF CONCORD, the  last of the special Lutheran creeds, all the doctrines of which Arndt  cordially received, as he repeatedly declared in an official manner on  various occasions, in his writings, in his last will and testament, and on  his death-bed. (See below §§ 24, 25.) The very great reverence with which  he regarded this noble creed, and his attachment to it, are to be ascribed  not only to the spotless purity of the doctrines which it sets forth, but  also to the good work which it performed in successfully and permanently  deciding several very important questions which had latterly arisen, and  on which the preceding creeds had not authoritatively and fully  pronounced. It is, however, obvious, that even after these storms  subsided, the waves would long remain in commotion, and it was precisely  in these troublous times that Arndt labored in the ministry.    § 16. The catalogue of the difficulties which awaited him, is not yet  exhausted. We have to add, as a part of the history of the times, when an  extraordinary number of political and ecclesiastical contentions  prevailed, the excitement of feeling which certain differences of doctrine  between the Lutherans and the Reformed engendered, and which would never  have risen to the fearful height in which history now exhibits it to us,  if political power, controlled alternately by the two religious parties in  some of the German principalities, had not been invoked by them. The awful  death by fire, which terminated the career of Servetus (Oct. 27, 1553, two  years before the birth of Arndt, and more than six years after the death  of Luther), was decreed by the civil authorities of Geneva, but was  sanctioned by Calvin and even the gentle"]]]
