[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#3)"],[1,"(Paris, Heideloff, 1830), edited by the Comte d'Aure, the Ordonnateur  en Chef of the Egyptian expedition, and containing communications from  Joseph Bonaparte, Gourgaud, Stein, etc.'         --[In the notes in this present edition these volumes are referred     to in brief 'Erreurs'.]--    Part of the system of attack was to call in question the authenticity  of the Memoirs, and this was the more easy as Bourrienne, losing his  fortune, died in 1834 in a state of imbecility. But this plan is not  systematically followed, and the very reproaches addressed to the writer  of the Memoirs often show that it was believed they were really written  by Bourrienne. They undoubtedly contain plenty of faults. The editor  (Villemarest, it is said) probably had a large share in the work, and  Bourrienne must have forgotten or misplaced many dates and occurrences.  In such a work, undertaken so many years after the events, it was  inevitable that many errors should be made, and that many statements  should be at least debatable. But on close investigation the work stands  the attack in a way that would be impossible unless it had really been  written by a person in the peculiar position occupied by Bourrienne.  He has assuredly not exaggerated that position: he really, says Lucien  Bonaparte, treated as equal with equal with Napoleon during a part of  his career, and he certainly was the nearest friend and confidant that  Napoleon ever had in his life.    Where he fails, or where the Bonapartist fire is most telling, is in the  account of the Egyptian expedition. It may seem odd that he should have  forgotten, even in some thirty years, details such as the way in which  the sick were removed; but such matters were not in his province; and  it would be easy to match similar omissions in other works, such as the  accounts of the Crimea, and still more of the Peninsula. It is with his  personal relations with Napoleon that we are most concerned, and it is  in them that his account receives most corroboration.    It may be interesting to see what has been said of the Memoirs by other  writers. We have quoted Metternich, and Lucien Bonaparte; let us hear  Meneval, his successor, who remained faithful to his master to the end:  \"Absolute confidence cannot be given to statements contained in Memoirs  published under the name of a man who has not composed them. It is known  that the editor of these Memoirs offered to M. de Bourrienne, who had  then taken refuge in Holstein from his creditors, a sum said to be  thirty thousand francs to obtain his signature to them, with some notes  and addenda. M. de Bourrienne was already attacked by the disease from  which he died a few years latter in a maison de sante at Caen. Many  literary men co-operated in the preparation of his Memoirs. In 1825 I  met M. de Bourrienne in Paris. He told me it had been suggested to him  to write against the Emperor. 'Notwithstanding the harm he has done me,'  said he, 'I would never do so. Sooner may my hand be withered.' If M.  de Bourrienne had prepared his Memoirs himself, he would not have stated  that while he was the Emperor's minister at Hamburg he worked with  the agents of the Comte de Lille (Louis XVIII.) at the preparation of  proclamations in favour of that Prince, and that in 1814 he accepted the  thanks of the King, Louis XVIII., for doing so; he would not have said  that Napoleon had confided to him in 1805 that he had never conceived  the idea of an expedition into England, and that the plan of a landing,  the preparations for which he gave such publicity to, was only a snare  to amuse fools. The Emperor well knew that never was there a plan more  seriously conceived or more positively settled. M. de Bourrienne would  not have spoken of his private interviews with Napoleon, nor of the  alleged confidences entrusted to him, while really Napoleon had no  longer received him after the 20th October 1802. When the Emperor,  in 1805, forgetting his faults, named him Minister Plenipotentiary at  Hamburg, he granted him the customary audience, but to this favour  he did not add the return of his former friendship. Both before  and afterwards he constantly refused to receive him, and he did not  correspond with him.\" (Meneval, ii. 378-79). And in another passage  Meneval says: \"Besides, it would be wrong to regard these Memoirs as  the work of the man whose name they bear. The bitter resentment M.  de Bourrienne had nourished for his disgrace, the enfeeblement of his  faculties, and the poverty he was reduced to, rendered him accessible to  the pecuniary offers made to him. He consented to give the authority  of his name to Memoirs in whose composition he had only co-operated by  incomplete, confused, and often inexact notes, materials which an editor  was employed to put in order.\" And Meneval (iii. 29-30) goes on to quote  what he himself had written in the Spectateur Militaire, in which he  makes much the same assertions, and especially objects to the account  of conversations with the Emperor after 1802, except always the one  audience on taking leave for Hamburg. Meneval also says that Napoleon,  when he wished to obtain intelligence from Hamburg, did not correspond  with Bourrienne, but deputed him, Meneval, to ask Bourrienne for what  was wanted. But he corroborates Bourrienne on the subject of the efforts  made, among others by Josephine, for his reappointment.    Such are the statements of the Bonapartists pure; and the reader, as has  been said, can judge for himself how far the attack is good. Bourrienne,  or his editor, may well have confused the date of his interviews, but  he will not be found much astray on many points. His account of the  conversation of Josephine after the death of the Duc d'Enghien may be  compared with what we know from Madame de Rémusat, who, by the way,  would have been horrified if she had known that he considered her to  resemble the Empress Josephine in character.    We now come to the views of Savary, the Duc de Rovigo, who avowedly  remained on good terms with Bourrienne after his disgrace, though the  friendship of Savary was not exactly a thing that most men would have  much prided themselves on. \"Bourrienne had a prodigious memory; he spoke  and wrote in several languages, and his pen ran as quickly as one could  speak. Nor were these the only advantages he possessed. He knew the  routine of public business and public law. His activity and devotion  made him indispensable to the First Consul. I knew the qualities which  won for him the unlimited confidence of his chief, but I cannot speak  with the same assurance of the faults which made him lose it. Bourrienne  had many enemies, both on account of his character and of his place\"  (Savary, i. 418-19).    Marmont ought to be an impartial critic of the Memoirs. He says,  \"Bourrienne . . . had a very great capacity, but he is a striking  example of the great truth that our passions are always bad counsellors.  By inspiring us with an immoderate ardour to reach a fixed end, they  often make us miss it. Bourrienne had an immoderate love of money.  With his talents and his position near Bonaparte at the first dawn of  greatness, with the confidence and real good-will which Bonaparte felt  for him, in a few years he would have gained everything in fortune and  in social position. But his eager impatience mined his career at the  moment when it might have developed and increased\" (Marmont, i. 64). The  criticism appears just. As to the Memoirs, Marmont says (ii. 224), \"In  general, these Memoirs are of great veracity and powerful interest so  long as they treat of what the author has seen and heard; but when  he speaks of others, his work is only an assemblage of gratuitous  suppositions and of false facts put forward for special purposes.\"    The Comte Alexandre de Puymaigre, who arrived at Hamburgh soon after  Bourrienne had left it in 1810, says (page 135) of the part of the  Memoirs which relates to Hamburg, \"I must acknowledge that generally his  assertions are well founded. This former companion of Napoleon has only  forgotten to speak of the opinion that they had of him in this town.    \"The truth is, that he was believed to have made much money there.\"    Thus we may take Bourrienne as a clever, able man, who would have  risen to the highest honours under the Empire had not his short-sighted  grasping after lucre driven him from office, and prevented him from ever  regaining it under Napoleon.    In the present edition the translation has been carefully compared with  the original French text. Where in the original text information is  given which has now become mere matter of history, and where Bourrienne  merely quotes the documents well enough known at this day, his  possession of which forms part of the charges of his opponents,  advantage has been taken to lighten the mass of the Memoirs. This  has been done especially where they deal with what the writer did not  himself see or hear, the part of the Memoirs which are of least valve  and of which Marmont's opinion has just been quoted. But in the  personal and more valuable part of the Memoirs, where we have the actual  knowledge of the secretary himself, the original text has been either  fully retained, or some few passages previously omitted restored.  Illustrative notes have been added from the Memoirs of the successor  of Bourrienne, Meneval, Madame de Rémusat, the works of Colonel Iung  on 'Bonaparte et Son Temps', and on 'Lucien Bonaparte', etc., and other  books. Attention has also been paid to the attacks of the 'Erreurs',  and wherever these criticisms are more than a mere expression of  disagreement, their purport has been recorded with, where possible,  some judgment of the evidence. Thus the reader will have before him the  materials for deciding himself how far, Bourrienne's statements are in  agreement with the facts and with the accounts of other writers.    At the present time too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#3)"],[1,"7, (1, 21-25).  Translated in Appendix B.]    This book became the great text of the Middle Ages; its author's name  was given to the geocentric theory it maintained. Astronomy for a  thousand years was valuable only to determine the time of Easter and  other festivals of the Church, and to serve as a basis for astrology  for the mystery-loving people of Europe.    To the Arabians in Syria and in Spain belongs the credit of preserving  for Europe during this long period the astronomical works of the  Greeks, to which they added their own valuable observations of the  heavens--valuable because made with greater skill and better  instruments,[23] and because with these observations later scientists  could illustrate the permanence or the variability of important  elements. They also discovered the so-called \"trepidation\" or apparent  shifting of the fixed stars to explain which they added another sphere  to Ptolemy's eight. Early in the sixth century Uranus translated  Aristotle's works into Syrian, and this later was translated into  Arabic.[24] Albategnius[25] (c. 850-829 [Transcriber's Note: 929]  A.D.), the Arabian prince who was the greatest of all their  astronomers, made his observations from Aracte and Damascus, checking  up and in some cases amending Ptolemy's results.[26]    [Footnote 23: Whewell: I, 239.]    [Footnote 24: Whewell: I, 294.]    [Footnote 25: Berry: 79.]    [Footnote 26: His book _De Motu Stellarum_, translated into Latin by  Plato Tiburtinus (fl. 1116) was published at Nuremberg (1557) by  Melancthon with annotations by Regiomontanus. _Ency. Brit._ 11th.  Edit.]    Then the center of astronomical development shifted from Syria to  Spain and mainly through this channel passed on into Western Europe.  The scientific fame of Alphonse X of Castile (1252-1284 A.D.) called  the Wise, rests chiefly upon his encouragement of astronomy. With his  support the Alfonsine Tables were calculated. He is said[27] to have  summoned fifty learned men from Toledo, Cordova and Paris to translate  into Spanish the works of Ptolemy and other philosophers. Under his  patronage the University of Salamanca developed rapidly to become  within two hundred years one of the four great universities of  Europe[28]--a center for students from all over Europe and the  headquarters for new thought, where Columbus was sheltered,[29] and  later the Copernican system was accepted and publicly taught at a time  when Galileo's views were suppressed.[30]    [Footnote 27: Vaughan: I, 281.]    [Footnote 28: Graux: 318.]    [Footnote 29: Graux: 319.]    [Footnote 30: Rashdall: II, pt. I, 77.]    Popular interest in astronomy was evidently aroused, for Sacrobosco  (to give John Holywood[31] his better known Latin name) a Scotch  professor at the Sorbonne in Paris in the 13th century, published a  small treatise _De Sphaeri Mundo_ that was immensely popular for  centuries,[32] though it was practically only an abstract of the  _Almagest_. Whewell[33] tells of a French poem of the time of Edward I  entitled _Ymage du Monde_, which gave the Ptolemaic view and was  illustrated in the manuscript in the University of Cambridge with a  picture of the spherical earth with men upright on it at every point,  dropping balls down perforations in the earth to illustrate the  tendency of all things toward the center. Of the same period (13th  century) is an Arabian compilation in which there is a reference to  another work, the book of Hammarmunah the Old, stating that \"the earth  turns upon itself in the form of a circle, and that some are on top,  the others below ... and there are countries in which it is constantly  day or in which at least the night continues only some instants.\"[34]  Apparently, however, such advanced views were of no influence, and the  Ptolemaic theory remained unshaken down to the close of the 15th  century.    [Footnote 31: _Dict. of Nat. Biog._]    [Footnote 32: MSS. of it are extremely numerous. It was the second  astronomical book to be printed, the first edition appearing at  Ferrara in 1472. 65 editions appeared before 1647. It was translated  into Italian, French, German, and Spanish, and had many commentators.  _Dict. of Nat. Biog._]    [Footnote 33: Whewell: I, 277.]    [Footnote 34: Blavatski: II, 29, note.]    Aside from the adequacy of this explanation of the universe for the  times, the attitude of the Church Fathers on the matter was to a  large degree responsible for this acquiescence. Early in the first  century A.D., Philo Judaeus[35] emphasized the minor importance of  visible objects compared with intellectual matters,--a foundation  stone in the Church's theory of an homocentric universe. Clement of  Alexandria (c. 150 A.D.) calls the heavens solid since what is solid  is capable of being perceived by the senses.[36] Origen (c. 185-c.  254.) has recourse to the Holy Scriptures to support his notion that  the sun, moon, and stars are living beings obeying God's commands.[37]  Then Lactantius thunders against those who discuss the universe as  comparable to people discussing \"the character of a city they have  never seen, and whose name only they know.\" \"Such matters cannot be  found out by inquiry.\"[38] The existence of the antipodes and the  rotundity of the earth are \"marvelous fictions,\" and philosophers are  \"defending one absurd opinion by another\"[39] when in explanation why  bodies would not fall off a spherical earth, they claim these are  borne to the center.    [Footnote 35: Philo Judaeus: _Quis Rerum Divinarum Haeres._ (IV, 7).]    [Footnote 36: Clement of Alexandria: _Stromatum_, Lib. V, c. 14, (III,  67).]    [Footnote 37: Origen: _De Principiis_, Lib. I, c. 7, (XI, 171).]    [Footnote 38: Lactantius: _Divinarum Institutionum_, Lib. III, c. 3  (VI, 355).]    [Footnote 39: Ibid: Lib. III, c. 24, (VI, 425-428).]    How clearly even this brief review illustrates what Henry Osborn  Taylor calls[40] the fundamental principles of patristic faith: that  the will of God is the one cause of all things (voluntate Dei  immobilis manet et stat in saeculum terra.[41] Ambrose: _Hexaemeron_.)  and that this will is unsearchable. He further points out that  Augustine's and Ambrose's sole interest in natural fact is as  \"confirmatory evidence of Scriptural truth.\" The great Augustine  therefore denies the existence of antipodes since they could not be  peopled by Adam's children.[42] He indifferently remarks  elsewhere:[43] \"What concern is it to me whether the heavens as a  sphere enclose the earth in the middle of the world or overhang it on  either side?\" Augustine does, however, dispute the claims of  astrologers accurately to foretell the future by the stars, since the  fates of twins or those born at the same moment are so diverse.[44]    [Footnote 40: Taylor: _Mediaeval Mind_, I, 74.]    [Footnote 41: By the will of God the earth remains motionless and  stands throughout the age.]    [Footnote 42: Augustine: _De Civitate Dei_, Lib. XVI, c. 9, (41, p.  437).]    [Footnote 43: Augustine: _De Genesi_, II, c. 9, (v. 34, p. 270).  (White's translation).]    [Footnote 44: Augustine: _Civitate Dei_, Lib. V, c. 5, (v. 41, p.  145).]    Philastrius (d. before 397 A.D.) dealing with various heresies,  denounces those who do not believe the stars are fixed in the heavens  as \"participants in the vanity of pagans and the foolish opinions of  philosophers,\" and refers to the widespread idea of the part the  angels play in guiding and impelling the heavenly bodies in their  courses.[45]    [Footnote 45: Philastrius: _De Haeresibus_, c. 133, (v. 12, p. 1264).]    It would take a brave man to face such attitudes of scornful  indifference on the one hand and denunciation on the other, in support  of a theory the Church considered heretical.    Meanwhile the Church was developing the homocentric notion which  would, of course, presuppose the central position in the universe for  man's abiding place. In the pseudo-Dionysius[46] is an elaborately  worked out hierarchy of the beings in the universe that became the  accepted plan of later centuries, best known to modern times through  Dante's blending of it with the Ptolemaic theory in the _Divine  Comedy_.[47] Isidore of Seville taught that the universe was created  to serve man's purposes,[48] and Peter Lombard (12th cent.) sums up  the situation in the definite statement that man was placed at the  center of the universe to be served by that universe and in turn  himself to serve God.[49] Supported by the mighty Thomas Aquinas[50]  this became a fundamental Church doctrine.    [Footnote 46: Pseudo-Dionysius: _De Coelesti Ierarchia_, (v. 122, p.  10354).]    [Footnote 47: Milman: VIII, p. 228-9. See the _Paradiso_.]    [Footnote 48: Isidore of Seville: _De Ordine Creaturarum_, c. 5, sec.  3, (v. 83, p. 923).]    [Footnote 49: Lombard: _Sententia_, Bk. II, Dist. I, sec. 8, (v. 192,  p. 655).]    [Footnote 50: Aquinas: _Summa Theologica_, pt. I, qu. 70, art. 2.  (_Op. Om. Caietani_, V, 179).]    An adequate explanation of the universe existed. Aristotle, Augustine,  and the other great authorities of the Middle Ages, all upheld the  conception of a central earth encircled by the seven planetary spheres  and by the all embracing starry firmament. In view of the phrases used  in the Bible about the heavens, and in view of the formation of  fundamental theological doctrines based on this supposition by the  Church Fathers, is it surprising that any other than a geocentric  theory seemed untenable, to be dismissed with a smile when not  denounced as heretical? Small wonder is it, in the absence of the  present day mechanical devices for the exact measurement of time and  space as aids to observation, that the Ptolemaic, or geocentric,  theory of the universe endured through centuries as it did, upheld by  the authority both of the Church and, in essence at least, by the  great philosophers whose works constituted the teachings of the  schools.
