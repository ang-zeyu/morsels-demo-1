At the same time it       must be remembered that, with an interval of in all not more       than nine days' rest, my horse had previously carried me 500       miles. In London, judging by his size, he would have been put       down as a polo pony. In spite of the twenty stone he carried,       he had never been either sick or lame during the journey, and       had galloped the last 17 miles through the snow to Kasala in       one hour and twenty-five minutes.\"    The same author describes a remarkable forced march made in the summer  of 1870 by Count Borkh in Russian Tartary. The Count's mission was to  test the possibility of taking artillery over the steep and difficult  passes in a certain district, and his force consisted of 150 cossacks,  and 60 mounted riflemen and a gun. The troops accomplished their journey  out and back, 266 miles, in six days; the heat was excessive, the  thermometer marking sometimes as much as 117 deg. Fahr. during the day; yet  the ponies were none the worse of their exertions, the \"sick list\" at  the end comprising only twelve, all of which suffered from sore backs  caused by careless saddling. Other expeditions under similar conditions  are mentioned; these go to prove that the endurance of the Tartar pony  is affected as little by heat as by cold.          POST HORSES IN SIBERIA.      Mr. H. de Windt, in his book _From Pekin to Calais_, bears witness to  the wonderful endurance of the small post-horses supplied to travellers  in Siberia. He describes them as very little beasts ranging from 14.2 to  15 hands. \"Though rough and ungroomed, they are well fed, as they need  to be, for a rest of only six hours is allowed between stages.\" The  speed maintained depends upon the condition of the roads; and the number  of horses furnished for each tarantass is regulated by the same factor;  three horses sufficing in good weather and as many as seven being  required when the roads are heavy from rain or snow.          PONIES IN INDIA.      Captain L. E. Nolan, in _Cavalry History and Tactics_ (1860), gives an  account of an experimental march made by 200 of the 15th Hussars from  Bangalore to Hyderabad and back, 800 miles. The objects of the march  were to test the capabilities of the troop horses and to ascertain if  there were anything to choose between stallions and geldings in respect  of endurance. To arrive at a solution of the latter question, one  hundred of the men were mounted on entires and the other hundred on  horses which had been castrated only six months previously, regardless  of age, for the purpose of making the experiment.    The squadrons marched to their destination, took part in field-days and  pageants, and started to reach Bangalore by forced marches; they  accomplished the last 180 miles at a rate of thirty miles per day,  bringing in only one led horse, the remainder being perfectly sound and  fit for further work. One horse, a 14.3 Persian, carried a corporal who,  with his accoutrements, rode 22 stone 7 lbs. It may be added that there  was nothing to choose between the performances of the stallions and  geldings; though the fact that the latter had so recently been castrated  was held to make their achievement the more creditable.    A forced march such as this has far more value as testimony to staying  power than a more trying feat performed by a single animal; but mention  must be made of Captain Horne's ride. This officer, who belonged to the  Madras Horse Artillery, undertook in 1841 to ride his grey Arab,  \"Jumping Jimmy,\" 400 miles in five days on the Bangalore race-course;  and accomplished his task with three hours and five minutes to spare,  the horse doing the last 79 miles 5 furlongs in 19 hours 55 minutes, and  being quite ready for his corn when pulled up. General Tweedie, in his  work on _The Arabian Horse_ (1894), quotes the above particulars from  the _Bengal Sporting Magazine_, in whose pages full details are given.    Captain Nolan, in the work from which quotation has been made above,  sums up the shortcomings of the cavalry trooper of his day in the  following pithy sentences:--         \"Our cavalry horses are feeble; they measure high, but they do       so from length of limb, which is weakness, not power. The blood       they require is not that of our weedy race-horse (an animal       more akin to the greyhound and bred for speed alone), but it is       the blood of the Arab and Persian, to give them that compact       form and wiry limb in which they are wanting.\"    The great value of the pony in India was insisted on by Mr. J. H. B.  Hallen, formerly the General Superintendent of the Horse Breeding  Department, in a memorandum published at Meerut in 1899. Pointing out  the many spheres of utility open to the pony, he urged the local  authorities and agricultural societies to foster and develop pony  breeding by providing suitable stallions for public use. As proving the  value of the pony, Mr. Hallen points out that in the two-wheeled cart  called an _ekka_, used by the natives of Northern India, a pony will  draw a load of from 4-1/2 to 6 cwt. over long distances at a rate of 5  or 6 miles an hour.    Ponies all over India are equally in request for riding and driving, and  in the northern parts for pack purposes. Indeed, adds Mr. Hallen, \"the  pony may be said to be all round the most useful animal.\" The supply is  not equal to the demand.    Captain H. L. Powell, R.H.A., writing in _Baily's Magazine_ of March,  1900, says:--         \"I am a great believer in the Arab for officers' chargers,       light cavalry and mounted infantry in this campaign. The Arab       is a hardy little beast, and will thrive and do well on what       would be starvation rations for an ordinary troop-horse. As a       rule the Arab is rather light of bone, but his bone is twice as       strong as that of an underbred horse. I have an Arab pony about       14.2 which I am looking after for his owner who went out to the       war, and who is now, I am sorry to say, enjoying Mr. Kruger's       hospitality in Pretoria. The pony carries my 15 stone as if it       was a feather, and never seems to tire.\"    The superiority of the Arab over the Indian country-bred is reflected  in their respective cost. Mr. Hallen, in the memorandum before referred  to, says stallions of the country-bred class can be obtained at from  about L6 10s. to L13, while suitable Arab pony stallions cost from L16  10s. to L33.          PONIES IN NORTHERN AFRICA.[2]      The best authority on the breeds used by the Arabs of Northern Africa is  probably General E. Daumas, who held high commands in Algeria and was  for a time the French Consul at Mascara. The Chasseurs d'Afrique are  mounted on Barbs, and thus the capabilities of these horses were of  practical importance to this officer; moreover, he took a very keen  personal interest in all matters relating to the horse, and spared no  endeavour to inform himself concerning the breed of the country in which  he resided. Hence the description in General Daumas' book, _The Horses  of the Sahara: with Commentaries by the Emir Abd El Kadr_ (1863) is  accepted as the standard on the Barb.    [2] The Barb, there is no possible doubt, is of pure Arab origin: in the  seventh century, when the Fatimite sect of Mohammedans held sway in  Egypt, numerous Arab tribes migrated to Africa and gradually spread over  the whole of the northern portion of the continent; the horses they  brought with them spread in like manner.    The letters of the famous Emir to General Daumas, containing categorical  replies to questions put by the latter, show that the Barbs possess  endurance in a very remarkable degree. Their average height is nowhere  mentioned in this work, but they are, as we believe, somewhat smaller  than the Arab in his native country and in India. There is a suggestive  hint of their small size in a remark by General Daumas: he says that  inexperienced horsemen with their spurs \"sometimes prick the animal on  the knee-pan and so lame him if the wound be deep.\" Assuming that the  average height of the horseman be 5 feet 6 inches, and making due  allowance for the \"straight-legged\" seat of the cavalry man, the  General's remark points to a horse certainly not over 14 hands.    In answer to General Daumas' enquiry as to the amount of work a Barb can  do, the Emir replies:--         \"A horse sound in every limb and eating as much barley as his       stomach can contain can do whatever his rider can ask of him.       For this reason the Arabs say, 'give barley and over-work him,'       but without tasking him over much a horse can be made to do       about sixteen _parasangs_ (equal to about fifty English miles)       a day, day after day. It is the distance from Mascara to       Koudiat Aghelizan on the Oued-Mina: it has been measured in       cubits. A horse performing this journey every day, and having       as much barley as it likes to eat, can go on without fatigue       for three or four months without lying by a single day.\"    The Arabs on their _razzias_, or cattle-stealing expeditions, of  necessity travel with as little encumbrance as possible: on such  expeditions, which may require twenty or twenty-five days' rapid travel,  each horseman carries only enough barley to give his mount eight feeds.  In some parts of the Sahara green food is never given; frequent watering  is recommended by all Arab horsemen.    An Arab of the Arbaa tribe gave General Daumas full particulars of a  ride he once undertook to save a highly prized mare from the hands of  the Turks. In twenty-four hours he rode her eighty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#3)"],[1,"should,  under the circumstances, do the same as French boys, whatever that  might be.    As soon as the packet was once fairly beyond the harbour Harry's  thoughts were effectually diverted from all other matters by the  motion of the sailing boat, and he was soon in a state of prostration,  in which he remained until, seven hours later, the packet entered  Calais harbour.    Dr. Sandwith had requested the captain to allow one of his men  to show Harry the way to the Lion door. Harry had pulled himself  together a little as the vessel entered the still water in the  harbour, and was staring at the men in their blue blouses and wooden  shoes, at the women in their quaint and picturesque attire, when  a sailor touched him on the shoulder:    \"Now, young sir, the captain tells me I am to show you the way to  your hotel. Which is your box?\"    Harry pointed out his trunk; the sailor threw it on his shoulder,  and Harry, with a feeling of bewilderment, followed him along the  gangway to the shore. Here he was accosted by an officer.    \"What does he say?\" he asked the sailor.    \"He asks for your passport.\"    Harry fumbled in his breast pocket for the document which his father  had obtained for him from the foreign office, duly viseed by the  French ambassador, notifying  that Henry Sandwith, age sixteen,  height five feet eight, hair brown, eyes gray, nose short, mouth  large, was about to reside in France in the family of the Marquis  de St.  Caux. The officer glanced it over, and then returned it to  Harry with a polite bow, which Harry in some confusion endeavoured  to imitate.    \"What does the fellow want to bow and scrape like that for?\" he  muttered to himself as he followed his guide. \"An Englishman would  just have nodded and said 'All right!' What can a fellow want more,  I should like to know? Well I suppose I shall get accustomed to  it, and shall take to bowing and scraping as a matter of course.\"    The Lion door was close at hand. In reply to the sailor's question  the landlord said that M. du Tillet was within. The sailor put  down the trunk, pocketed the coin Harry gave him, and with a \"Good  luck, young master!\" went out, taking with him, as Harry felt,  the last link to England. He turned and followed the landlord. The  latter mounted a flight of stairs, knocked at a door, and opened  it.    \"A young gentleman desires to see M. du Tillet,\" he said, and Harry  entered.    A tall, big man, whose proportions at once disappointed Harry's  preconceived notions as to the smallness and leanness of Frenchmen,  rose from the table at which he was writing.    \"Monsieur--Sandwith?\" he said interrogatively. \"I am glad to see  you.\"    Harry did not understand the latter portion of the remark, but he  caught the sound of his name.    \"That's all right,\" he said nodding. \"How do you do, M. du Tillet?\"    The French gentleman bowed; Harry bowed; and then they looked  at each other. There was nothing more to say. A smile stole over  Harry's face, and broke into a frank laugh. The Frenchman smiled,  put his hand on Harry's shoulder, and said:    \"Brave garcon!\" and Harry felt they were friends.    M. du Tillet's face bore an expression of easy good temper. He wore  a wig with long curls; he had a soldier's bearing, and a scar on  his left cheek; his complexion was dark and red, his eyebrows black  and bushy. After a pause he said:    \"Are you hungry?\" and then put imaginary food to his mouth.    \"You mean will I eat anything?\" Harry translated. \"Yes, that I  will if there's anything fit to eat. I begin to feel as hungry as  a hunter, and no wonder, for I am as hollow as a drum!\"    His nod was a sufficient answer. M. du Tillet took his hat, opened  the door, and bowed for Harry to precede him.    Harry hesitated, but believing it would be the polite way to do as  he was told, returned the bow and went out. The Frenchman put his  hand on his shoulder, and they went down stairs together and took  their seats in the salon, where his companion gave an order, and  in two or three minutes a bowl of broth was placed before each of  them.    It fully answered Harry's ideas as to the thinness of French soup,  for it looked like dirty water with a few pieces of bread and some  scraps of vegetables floating in it. He was astonished at the piece  of bread, nearly a yard long, placed on the table. M. du Tillet  cut a piece off and handed it to him. He broke a portion of it into  his broth, and found, when he tasted it, that it was much nicer  than it looked.    \"It's not so bad after all,\" he thought to himself.  \"Anyhow bread  seems plentiful, so there's no fear of my starving.\"  He followed  his companion's example and made his way steadily through a number  of dishes all new and strange to him; neither his sight nor his taste  gave him the slightest indication as to what meat he was eating.    \"I suppose it's all right,\" he concluded; \"but what people can want  to make such messes of their food for I can't make out. A slice of  good roast beef is worth the lot of it; but really it isn't nasty;  some of the dishes are not bad at all if one only knew what they  were made of.\" M. du Tillet offered him some wine, which he tasted  but shook his head, for it seemed rough and sour; but he poured  himself out some water. Presently a happy idea seized him; he  touched the bread and said interrogatively, \"Bread?\" M. du Tillet  at once replied \"Pain,\" which Harry repeated after him.    The ice thus broken, conversation began, and Harry soon learned the  French for knife, fork, spoon, plate, and various other articles,  and felt that he was fairly on the way towards talking French.  After the meal was over M. du Tillet rose and put on his hat, and  signed to Harry to accompany him. They strolled through the town,  went down to the quays and looked at the fishing-boats; Harry was  feeling more at home now, and asked the French name for everything  he saw, repeating the word over and over again to himself until he  felt sure that he should remember it, and then asking the name of  some fresh object.    The next morning they started in the post-waggon for Paris, and  arrived there after thirty-six hours' travel. Harry was struck  with the roads, which were far better tended and kept than those in  England. The extreme flatness of the country surprised him, and,  except in the quaintness of the villages and the variety of the  church towers, he saw little to admire during the journey.    \"If it is all like this,\" he thought to himself, \"I don't see that  they have any reason for calling it La belle France.\"    Of Paris he saw little. A blue-bloused porter carried his trunk what  seemed to Harry a long distance from the place where the conveyance  stopped. The streets here were quiet and almost deserted after the  busy thoroughfares of the central city. The houses stood, for the  most part, back from the street, with high walls and heavy gates.    \"Here we are at last,\" his guide said, as he halted before a large  and massive gateway, surmounted by a coat of arms with supporters  carved in stone work. He rang at the bell, which was opened by a  porter in livery, who bowed profoundly upon seeing M. du Tillet.  Passing through the doorway, Harry found himself in a spacious  hall, decorated with armour and arms. As he crossed the threshold  M. du Tillet took his hand and shook it heartily, saying, \"Welcome!\"  Harry understood the action, though not the words, and nodded,  saying:    \"I think I shall get on capitally if they are all as jolly as you  are.\"    Then they both laughed, and Harry looked round wondering what was  coming next.    \"The marquis and his family are all away at their chateau near  Dijon,\" his companion said, waving his hand. \"We shall stay a day  or two to rest ourselves after our journey, and then start to join  them.\"    He led Harry into a great salon magnificently furnished, pointed  to the chairs and looking-glasses and other articles of furniture,  all swathed up in coverings; and the lad understood at once that  the family were away. This was a relief to him; he was getting on  capitally with M. du Tillet, but shrank from the prospect of meeting  so many strange faces.    A meal was speedily served in a small and comfortably-furnished  apartment; and Harry concluded that although he might not be able  to decide on the nature of his food, it was really nice, and that  there was no fear whatever of his falling  away in flesh. M. du  Tillet pressed him to try the wine again, and this he found to be  a vast improvement upon the vintage he had tasted at Calais.    After breakfast next morning they started for a walk, and Harry  was delighted with the Louvre, the Tuileries, the Palais Royal, and  other public buildings, which he could not but acknowledge were  vastly superior to anything he had seen in London. Then he was  taken to a tailor's, the marquis having commissioned his guide to  carry out Dr. Sandwith's request in this matter. M. du Tillet looked  interrogatively at Harry as he entered the shop, as if to ask if  he understood why he was taken there.    Harry nodded, for indeed he was glad to see that no time was  to be lost, for he was already conscious that his dress differed  considerably from that of French boys. Several street gamins had  pointed at him and made jeering remarks, which, without understanding  the words, Harry felt to be insulting, and would, had he heard them  in the purlieus of Westminster, have considered as a challenge to  battle. He had not, however, suffered altogether unavenged, for  upon one occasion M. du Tillet turned sharply round and caught one  offender so smartly with his cane that he ran howling away.    \"They are awful guys!\" Harry thought as he looked at the French boys  he met. \"But it's better to be a guy than to be chaffed by every  boy one meets, especially if one is not to be allowed to fight.\"  It was, therefore, with a feeling of satisfaction that he turned  into"]]]
