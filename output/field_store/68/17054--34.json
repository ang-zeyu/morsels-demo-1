Many of them have great, honest, sympathetic hearts in their  bosoms, and, if we can only enlist them in our favor, they can give us a  peace and protection which for years we have been sighing. Yes, sighing,  because our hearts, though little, are none the less susceptible to all  the asperities--the terrible asperities of human nature. Papa will tell  you what I mean: you would not understand bird language.    Did you ever see my nest? I build it near the ground, and sometimes,  when kind friends prepare a little box for me, I occupy it. My song is  quite varied, but you will always recognize me by my call note, _Chek!  Chek! Chek!_ Some people say they hear me repeat \"Maids, maids, maids,  hang on your teakettle,\" but I think this is only fancy, for I can sing  a real song, admired, I am sure, by all who love                                                     SONG SPARROW.          THE CUCKOO.      Our first introduction to the Cuckoo was by means of the apparition  which issued hourly from a little German clock, such as are frequently  found in country inns. This particular clock had but one dial hand, and  the exact time of day could not be determined by it until the appearance  of the Cuckoo, who, in a squeaking voice, seemed to announce that it was  just one hour later or earlier, as the case might be, than at his last  appearance. We were puzzled, and remember fancying that a sun dial,  in clear weather, would be far more satisfactory as a time piece.  \"Coo-coo,\" the image repeated, and then retired until the hour hand  should summon him once more.    To very few people, not students of birds, is the Cuckoo really known.  Its evanescent voice is often recognized, but being a solitary wanderer  even ornithologists have yet to learn much of its life history. In their  habits the American and European Cuckoos are so similar that whatever of  poetry and sentiment has been written of them is applicable alike to  either. A delightful account of the species may be found in Dixon's Bird  Life, a book of refreshing and original observation.    \"The Cuckoo is found in the verdant woods, in the coppice, and even on  the lonely moors. He flits from one stunted tree to another and utters  his notes in company with the wild song of the Ring Ousel and the harsh  calls of the Grouse and Plover. Though his notes are monotonous, still  no one gives them this appellation. No! this little wanderer is held too  dear by us all as the harbinger of spring for aught but praise to be  bestowed on his mellow notes, which, though full and soft, are powerful,  and may on a calm morning, before the everyday hum of human toil begins,  be heard a mile away, over wood, field, and lake. Toward the summer  solstice his notes are on the wane, and when he gives them forth we  often hear him utter them as if laboring under great difficulty, and  resembling the syllables, \"_Coo-coo-coo-coo_\".\"    On one occasion Dixon says he heard a Cuckoo calling in treble notes,  _Cuck oo-oo, cuck-oo-oo_, inexpressibly soft and beautiful, notably the  latter one. He at first supposed an echo was the cause of these strange  notes, the bird being then half a mile away, but he satisfied himself  that this was not the case, as the bird came and alighted on a noble oak  a few yards from him and repeated the notes. The Cuckoo utters his notes  as he flies, but only, as a rule, when a few yards from the place on  which he intends alighting.    The opinion is held by some observers that Nature has not intended the  Cuckoo to build a nest, but influences it to lay its eggs in the nests  of other birds, and intrust its young to the care of those species best  adapted to bring them to maturity. But the American species does build  a nest, and rears its young, though Audubon gives it a bad character,  saying: \"It robs smaller birds of their eggs.\" It does not deserve the  censure it has received, however, and it is useful in many ways. Its  hatred of the worm is intense, destroying many more than it can eat. So  thoroughly does it do its work, that orchards, which three years ago,  were almost leafless, the trunks even being covered by slippery webbing,  are again yielding a good crop.    In September and October the Cuckoo is silent and suddenly disappears.  \"He seldom sees the lovely tints of autumn, and never hears the wintry  storm-winds' voice, for, impelled by a resistless impulse, he wings his  way afar over mountain, stream, and sea, to a land where northern blasts  are not felt, and where a summer sun is shining in a cloudless sky.\"     [Illustration: From col. O. E. Pagin.                  YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897 Chicago.]          THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMING BIRD.        Is it a gem, half bird,      Or is it a bird, half gem?                      --EDGAR FAWCETT.      Of all animated beings this is the most elegant in form and the most  brilliant in colors, says the great naturalist Buffon. The stones and  metals polished by our arts are not comparable to this jewel of Nature.  She has it least in size of the order of birds, _maxime miranda in  minimis_. Her masterpiece is the Humming bird, and upon it she has  heaped all the gifts which the other birds may only share. Lightness,  rapidity, nimbleness, grace, and rich apparel all belong to this little  favorite. The emerald, the ruby, and the topaz gleam upon its dress. It  never soils them with the dust of earth, and its aerial life scarcely  touches the turf an instant. Always in the air, flying from flower to  flower, it has their freshness as well as their brightness. It lives  upon their nectar, and dwells only in the climates where they  perennially bloom.    All kinds of Humming birds are found in the hottest countries of the New  World. They are quite numerous and seem to be confined between the two  tropics, for those which penetrate the temperate zones in summer stay  there only a short time. They seem to follow the sun in its advance and  retreat; and to fly on the zephyr wing after an eternal spring.    The smaller species of the Humming birds are less in size than the great  fly wasp, and more slender than the drone. Their beak is a fine needle  and their tongue a slender thread. Their little black eyes are like two  shining points, and the feathers of their wings so delicate that they  seem transparent. Their short feet, which they use very little, are so  tiny one can scarcely see them. They rarely alight during the day. They  have a swift continual humming flight. The movement of their wings is  so rapid that when pausing in the air, the bird seems quite motionless.  One sees him stop before a blossom, then dart like a flash to another,  visiting all, plunging his tongue into their hearts, flattening them  with his wings, never settling anywhere, but neglecting none. He hastens  his inconstancies only to pursue his loves more eagerly and to multiply  his innocent joys. For this light lover of flowers lives at their  expense without ever blighting them. He only pumps their honey, and  for this alone his tongue seems designed.    The vivacity of these small birds is only equaled by their courage, or  rather their audacity. Sometimes they may be seen furiously chasing  birds twenty times their size, fastening upon their bodies, letting  themselves be carried along in their flight, while they peck fiercely  until their tiny rage is satisfied. Sometimes they fight each other  vigorously. Impatience seems their very essence. If they approach a  blossom and find it faded, they mark their spite by a hasty rending of  the petals. Their only voice is a weak cry of _Screp, screp_, frequent  and repeated, which they utter in the woods from dawn until at the first  rays of the sun they all take flight and scatter over the country.    The Ruby-throat is the only native Humming bird of eastern North  America, where it is a common summer resident from May to October,  breeding from Florida to Labrador. The nest is a circle an inch and a  half in diameter, made of fern wood, plant down, and so forth, shingled  with lichens to match the color of the branch on which it rests. Its  only note is a shrill, mouse-like squeak.          THE HOUSE WREN.      All the children, it seems to me, are familiar with the habits of Johnny  and Jenny Wren; and many of them, especially such as have had some  experience with country life, could themselves tell a story of these  mites of birds. Mr. F. Saunders tells one: \"Perhaps you may think the  Wren is so small a bird he cannot sing much of a song, but he can. The  way we first began to notice him was by seeing our pet cat jumping about  the yard, dodging first one way and then another, then darting up a  tree; looking surprised, and disappointingly jumping down again.    \"Pussy had found a new play-mate, for the little Wren evidently thought  it great fun to fly down just in front of her and dart away before she  could reach him, leading her from one spot to another, hovering above  her head, chattering to her all the time, and at last flying up far out  of her reach. This he repeated day after day, for some time, seeming to  enjoy the fun of disappointing her so nicely and easily. But after a  while the little fellow thought he would like a play-mate nearer his own  size, and went off to find one. But he came back all alone, and perched  himself on the very tip-top of a lightning-rod on a high barn at the  back of the yard; and there he would sing his sweet little trilling  song, hour after hour, hardly stopping long enough to find food for his  meals. We wondered that he did not grow tired of it. For about a week we  watched him closely, and one day I came running into the house to tell  the rest of the family with surprise and delight that our little Wren  knew what he was about, for with his winning song he had called a mate  to him. He led her to the tree where he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30523"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#3)"],[1,"in his mind the images which are presented in our remarkable  pictures. See the birds at home, as it were, and hear their songs.    Those who fancy that few native birds live in our parks will be  surprised to read the following list of them now visible to the eyes of  so careful an observer as Mr. J. Chester Lyman.    \"About the 20th of May I walked one afternoon in Lincoln Park with a  friend whose early study had made him familiar with birds generally, and  we noted the following varieties:         1 Magnolia Warbler.       2 Yellow Warbler.       3 Black Poll Warbler.       4 Black-Throated Blue Warbler.       5 Black-Throated Queen Warbler.       6 Blackburnian Warbler.       7 Chestnut-sided Warbler.       8 Golden-crowned Thrush.       9 Wilson's Thrush.      10 Song Thrush.      11 Catbird.      12 Bluebird.      13 Kingbird.      14 Least Fly Catcher.      15 Wood Pewee Fly Catcher.      16 Great Crested Fly Catcher.      17 Red-eyed Vireo.      18 Chimney Swallow.      19 Barn Swallow.      20 Purple Martin.      21 Red Start.      22 House Wren.      23 Purple Grackle.      24 White-throated Sparrow.      25 Song Sparrow.      26 Robin.      27 Blue Jay.      28 Red-Headed Woodpecker.      29 Kingfisher.      30 Night Hawk.      31 Yellow-Billed Cuckoo.      32 Scarlet Tanager, Male and Female.      33 Black and White Creeper.      34 Gull, or Wilson's Tern.      35 The Omni-present English Sparrow.    \"On a similar walk, one week earlier, we saw about the same number of  varieties, including, however, the Yellow Breasted Chat, and the  Mourning, Bay Breasted, and Blue Yellow Backed Warblers.\"    The sweetest songsters are easily accessible, and all may enjoy their  presence.                                                      C. C. MARBLE.    [TO BE CONTINUED.]          THE CANVAS-BACK DUCK.      White-Back, Canard Cheval, (New Orleans,) Bull-Neck, and Red-Headed  Bull-Neck, are common names of the famous Canvas-Back, which nests from  the northern states, northward to Alaska. Its range is throughout nearly  all of North America, wintering from the Chesapeake southward to  Guatemala.    \"The biography of this duck,\" says Mabel Osgood Wright, \"belongs rather  to the cook-book than to a bird list,\" even its most learned biographers  referring mainly to its \"eatable qualities,\" Dr. Coues even taking away  its character in that respect when he says \"there is little reason for  squealing in barbaric joy over this over-rated and generally under-done  bird; not one person in ten thousand can tell it from any other duck on  the table, and only then under the celery circumstances,\" referring to  the particular flavor of its flesh, when at certain seasons it feeds on  vallisneria, or \"water celery,\" which won its fame. This is really not  celery at all, but an eel-grass, not always found through the range of  the Canvas-Back. When this is scarce it eats frogs, lizards, tadpoles,  fish, etc., so that, says Mrs. Osgood, \"a certificate of residence  should be sold with every pair, to insure the inspiring flavor.\"    The opinion held as to the edible qualities of this species varies  greatly in different parts of the country. No where has it so high a  reputation as in the vicinity of Chesapeake Bay, where the alleged  superiority of its flesh is ascribed to the abundance of \"water celery.\"  That this notion is erroneous is evident from the fact that the same  plant grows in far more abundance in the upper Mississippi Valley, where  also the Canvas-Back feeds on it. Hence it is highly probable that  fashion and imagination, or perhaps a superior style of cooking and  serving, play a very important part in the case. In California, however,  where the \"water celery\" does not grow, the Canvas-Back is considered a  very inferior bird for the table.    It has been hunted on Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries with such  inconsiderate greed that its numbers have been greatly reduced, and many  have been driven to more southern waters.    In and about Baltimore, the Canvas-Back, like the famous terrapin, is in  as high favor for his culinary excellence, as are the women for beauty  and hospitality. To gratify the healthy appetite of the human animal  this bird was doubtless sent by a kind Providence, none the less mindful  of the creature comforts and necessities of mankind than of the purely  aesthetic senses.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  CANVAS-BACK DUCK.]           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  WOOD DUCK.]    THE WOOD DUCK.      A great many people think that this is the most beautiful bird of North  America. It is called Wood Duck because it usually makes its nest in the  hollow of a tree that overhangs the water. If it can find a squirrel's  or woodpecker's hole in some stump or tree, there it is sure to nest.    A gentleman who delighted in watching the Wood Duck, tells about one  that built her nest in the hollow of a tree that hung over the water. He  was anxious to see how the little ones, when hatched, would get down.    In a few days he knew that the ducklings were out, for he could hear  their _pee, pee, pee_. They came to the edge of the nest, one by one,  and tumbled out into the water.    You know a duck can swim as soon as it comes out of the egg.    Sometimes the nest is in the hollow of a tree that is a short distance  from the water.    Now how do you suppose the ducklings get there as they do?    If the nest is not far from the ground, the mother bird lets them drop  from it on the dried grass and leaves under the tree. She then carries  them in her bill, one by one, to the water and back to the nest.    If the nest should be far from the ground, she carries them down one by  one.    This same gentleman says that he once saw a Wood Duck carry down  thirteen little ones in less than ten minutes. She took them in her bill  by the back of the neck or the wing.    When they are a few days old she needs only to lead the way and the  little ones will follow.    The Wood Duck is also called Summer Duck. This is because it does not  stay with us during the winter, as most ducks do.    It goes south to spend the winter and comes back north early in the  spring.          THE WOOD DUCK.      Quite the most beautiful of the native Ducks, with a a richness of  plumage which gives it a bridal or festive appearance, this bird is  specifically named _Spousa_, which means betrothed. It is also called  Summer Duck, Bridal Duck, Wood Widgeon, Acorn Duck and Tree Duck.    It is a fresh water fowl, and exclusively so in the selection of its  nesting haunts. It inhabits the whole of temperate North America, north  to the fur countries, and is found in Cuba and sometimes in Europe. Its  favorite haunts are wooded bottom-lands, where it frequents the streams  and ponds, nesting in hollows of the largest trees. Sometimes a hole in  a horizontal limb is chosen that seems too small to hold the Duck's  plump body, and occasionally it makes use of the hole of an Owl or  Woodpecker, the entrance to which has been enlarged by decay.    Wilson visited a tree containing a nest of a Wood or Summer Duck, on  the banks of Tuckahoe river, New Jersey. The tree stood on a declivity  twenty yards from the water, and in its hollow and broken top, about six  feet down, on the soft decayed wood were thirteen eggs covered with down  from the mother's breast. The eggs were of an exact oval shape, the  surface smooth and fine grained, of a yellowish color resembling old  polished ivory. This tree had been occupied by the same pair, during  nesting time, for four successive years. The female had been seen to  carry down from the nest thirteen young, one by one, in less than ten  minutes. She caught them in her bill by the wing or back of the neck,  landed them safely at the foot of the tree, and finally led them to the  water. If the nest be directly over the water, the little birds as soon  as hatched drop into the water, breaking their fall by extending their  wings.    Many stories are told of their attachment to their nesting places.  For several years one observer saw a pair of Wood Ducks make their  nest in the hollow of a hickory which stood on the bank, half a dozen  yards from a river. In preparing to dam the river near this point, in  order to supply water to a neighboring city, the course of the river  was diverted, leaving the old bed an eighth of a mile behind,  notwithstanding which the ducks bred in the old place, the female  undaunted by the distance which she would have to travel to lead her  brood to the water.    While the females are laying, and afterwards when sitting, the male  usually perches on an adjoining limb and keeps watch. The common note of  the drake is _peet-peet_, and when standing sentinel, if apprehending  danger, he makes a noise not unlike the crowing of a young cock,  _oe-eek_. The drake does not assist in sitting on the eggs, and the  female is left in the lurch in the same manner as the Partridge.    The Wood Duck has been repeatedly tamed and partially domesticated. It  feeds freely on corn meal soaked in water, and as it grows, catches  flies with great dexterity.           [Illustration: From col. F. C. Baker.                  ANHINGA OR SNAKE BIRD.]    THE ANHINGA OR SNAKE BIRD.      The Snake Bird is very singular indeed in appearance, and interesting as  well in its habits. Tropical and sub-tropical America, north to the  Carolinas and Southern Illinois, where it is a regular summer resident,  are its known haunts. Here it is recognized by different names, as Water  Turkey, Darter, and Snake Bird. The last mentioned seems to be the most  appropriate name for it, as the shape of its head and neck at once  suggest the serpent. In Florida it is called the Grecian Lady, at the  mouth of the Mississippi, Water Crow, and in Louisiana, Bec a Lancette.  It often swims with the body entirely under water, its head and long  neck in sight"]]]
