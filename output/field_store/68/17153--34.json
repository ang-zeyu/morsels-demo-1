I have myself seen,  in the grand collection of MSS., made in Venice, by the Abbate Canonici,  a book of the Evangelists, obtained in Udine, illustrated with  miniatures in pretty good taste for the thirteenth century, in which  they were produced; and similar relics are by no means rare throughout  the libraries of the state. I suspect, therefore, that many of those new  painters, either having been pupils of the miniaturists, or induced to  imitate them from the near connexion between the arts, attempted to vie  with them in design, in the distribution of their colours, and in their  compositions. Hence, it is clearly accounted for, why they did not  become the disciples, though acquainted with the works of Giotto, but  produced several respectable pieces of their own.    To this class belongs M. Paolo, whom Zanetti found recorded in an  ancient parchment, bearing the date of 1346. He is the earliest in the  national manner, of whom there exists a work with the indisputable name  of its author. It is to be seen in the great church of St. Mark,  consisting of a tablet, or, as it is otherwise called, _Ancona_, divided  into several compartments, representing the figure of a dead Christ,  with some of the Apostles, and historic incidents from the holy  Evangelist. There is inscribed underneath--_Magister Paulus cum Jacobo,  et Johanne filiis fecit hoc opus_; and Signor Zanetti, page 589,  observes in regard to it as follows:--_Among the specimens of simple  painting, in St. Mark's, the ball centre of the great altar is  remarkable for several small tablets of gold and silver, on which are  painted several figures in the ancient Greek manner. San Pietro Urseolo  had it constructed about the year 980, at Constantinople, and it was  removed to this place in the time of the Doge Ordelafo Faliero, in 1102,  though it was afterwards renovated by command of the Doge Pietro Ziani,  in 1209._ This historian did not discover the inscription which I found  upon it in the year 1782. The artist is sufficiently distinguished for  the period in which he flourished, although the stiffness in the design,  false action, and expression, beyond those of the best followers of  Giotto, are perceptible, so much as to remind us of the Greek specimens  of art.[13]    There can, likewise, be no doubt, that a painter of the name of Lorenzo,  was one of these Venetians, whose altarpiece in St. Antony of Castello,  to which is attached his name, with the date of 1358, _paid him three  hundred gold ducats_, has been commended by Zanetti. Besides, we read  inscribed on a picture belonging to the noble house of Ercolani, at  Bologna, the words MANU LAURENTII DE VENETIIS, 1368; and there is every  appearance of his being the author of the fresco in the church of  Mezzaratta, not far from Bologna, representing Daniel in the lions' den;  and bearing the signature of _Laurentius, P._ It is a work that bears no  resemblance to the style of Giotto, and appears to have been completed  about the year 1370. It is equally certain that Niccolo Semitecolo was a  Venetian, he having also inscribed his name as we find it written upon a  TRINITY, which represents the Virgin, along with some histories of St.  Sebastian, still preserved in the chapter library of Padua:--\"Nicoleto  Semitecolo da Veniexia impense, 1367.\" The work is an excellent specimen  of this school; the naked parts are tolerably well drawn, and the  proportions of the figures, though sometimes extravagantly so, are bold  and free; and what is more important to our present purpose, it  discovers no resemblance to the style of Giotto, being inferior in point  of design, though equal to him in regard to the colouring. Two other  painters, whose style betrays nothing of Giotto, were discovered by  Signor Sasso, in Venice, upon the strength of two altarpieces, to which  they had affixed their names. Upon one, found in the convent of _Corpus  Domini_, he read _Angelus pinxit_; and upon the other, also in the same  place, _Katarinus pinxit_. While on this subject, I ought not to pass  over the opinion of Baldinucci himself, who always appears to have  respected the freedom and independence of the Venetian as opposed to the  Florentine school, by refusing to insert the name of a single Venetian  in his tree of Cimabue. He merely maintained, that the Venetian painters  had improved their style by the labours of Angiol Gaddi, and of one  Antonio, a Venetian, whom, in spite of the authority of Vasari, he has  declared to be a Florentine; on which point we must refer to what has  already been stated in the first volume (p. 61) of this work. Moreover,  he asserts of the same Antonio, that he took up his residence at Venice,  and thence acquired the appellation of Veneziano; but that he took his  departure again, owing to the intrigues of the national professors, as  much as to say, of a school formed anterior to his arrival. And so long  anterior was it, indeed, that the whole state, as well as the adjacent  places, abounded not less with pictures than with pupils, although few  of their names with their productions have survived.[14]    Among these few is a Simon da Cusighe, who painted an altarpiece and a  fresco, still remaining in his native parish, situated near the city of  Belluno, where there exist memorials of one Pietro, and other artists of  the thirteenth century, along with some very tolerably executed figures,  bearing the epigraph of _Simon pinxit_. To these I add a native of  Friuli, of whom there are no authentic remains beyond Gemona, where he  painted the facade of the dome, and under a picture of the martyrdom of  I know not what saint, appears his name written, MCCCXXXII. MAGISTER  NICOLAUS PINTOR ME FECIT. To this artist is ascribed, by some writers,  that vast and meritorious production, still in such a fine state of  preservation, ornamenting the dome of Venzone, and which represents the  solemn scene of the Consecration; but its author is a matter of mere  conjecture, founded in this instance upon the vicinity of the place and  time, and resemblance of manner. There are also Pecino and Pietro de  Nova, who employed their talents, during a period of many years  subsequent to 1363, in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, at Bergamo.  But these, like the artist of Padua before mentioned, approach very  nearly the composition of Giotto, and possibly might have imbibed such a  taste at Milan.[15]    The splendor of Venetian painting becomes more strikingly manifest in  the fifteenth century; a period that was gradually preparing the way for  the grand manner of the Titians and the Giorgioni. The new style took  its rise in one of the islands called Murano; but it was destined to  attain its perfection in Venice. I first recognized the work of one of  the oldest of these artists, subscribing himself, _Quiricius de  Muriano_, in the studio of Signor Sasso. It represents our Saviour in a  sitting posture, at whose feet stands a veiled devotee; but there is no  mark by which to ascertain its age. There is, likewise, of uncertain  date, yet still very ancient, a Bernardino da Murano, of whose  productions Zanetti saw nothing more than a rude altarpiece. An Andrea  da Murano flourished about the period 1400, whose style, whatever it may  retain of harsh and dry, neither superior in composition, nor in choice  of features to that of his predecessors, discovers him to have been  tolerably skilful in design, even in regard to the extremities, and in  placing his figures well in the canvass.    There remains in his native place, at San Pier Martire, an altarpiece  painted by his hand, in which a St. Sebastian forms so conspicuous a  figure for the beauty of its torso, that Zanetti suspects it must have  been copied from some ancient statue. It is he who introduced the art  into the house of the Vivarini, his compatriots, who in a continued line  of succession preserved the school of Murano for nearly a century; and  who produced as rich a harvest of their labours in Venice, as did the  Campi afterwards in the city of Cremona, or the Procaccini in Milan. I  shall treat of them with brevity, but with such new sources of  information, as will at once serve to correct and amplify what has  already been written.    The first among the Vivarini mentioned by historians is Luigi, of whom a  painting at Santi Giovanni e Paolo, has been cited by them, which  represents our Redeemer bearing the cross upon his shoulders. The work  has been a good deal retouched, and there has been added to it another  portion, which gives the name of the author, dated 1414. Not being an  autograph, we are led to suspect some kind of mistake attaching either  to the name or the date; there having been another Luigi Vivarini, as we  shall shew, towards the close of the century. The one in question, then,  might probably be an ancestor of the latter, though it be difficult to  persuade ourselves of it, as there remains no other superscription, or  notice of any of that name so ancient.    Next to this artist, according to Ridolfo and Zanetti, are to be  enumerated Giovanni and Antonio Vivarini, who flourished about the year  1440. The authority they adduce for this, is an altarpiece in San  Pantaleone, which bears the inscription of _Zuane e Antonio da Muran  pense 1444_. But this Giovanni,[16] if I mistake not, is the same who  signs his name on another picture in Venice, _Joannes de Alemania et  Antonius de Muriano pinxit_; or as it is thus written in Padua, _Antonio  de Muran e Zohan Alamanus pinxit_. Giovanni, therefore, was a companion  of Antonio, a German by birth; and traces of a foreign style are clearly  perceptible in his paintings. The reason of his omitting to insert his  birthplace in the picture at San Pantaleone, arose, I suspect, from the  fact of his name and acquaintance with Antonio being too well known to  admit of doubt. After the year 1447"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34672"],[0,"Fish Stories (#3)"],[1,"mentioned above, the elder pickerel,  at one end of a trolling line, climbed into our boat; Bige, who had  the other end of the line, assisting him aboard.    \"Sufferin' Mackerel! Well by Gosh!! He's got a rudder on both ends;  he can swim both ways without turning around, like a ferry boat,\"  commented Bige, as we examined the floundering big fish, which had  the tail end of a smaller fish protruding three inches beyond his  snout, while the head of the younger was in the pit of the stomach of  the elder pickerel.      [Illustration: The Pickerel with two rudders]    I have heard and read many tales, illustrating the voracious appetite  of pickerel. Boardman in his book, \"Lovers of the Woods,\" tells how  his guide, George, while fishing in Long Lake, lost his Waterbury  watch overboard. Several days later, he caught a big pickerel and in  dressing it found his watch inside, still running. It seems that a  leather thong attached to the watch was wrapped around the winding  crown and the other end of the thong was looped over the fish's lower  jaw and hooked onto his teeth, so that whenever the pickerel opened  and closed his mouth the watch was wound half a turn, and thus was  kept running.    Not being an eye-witness, my testimony regarding this incident would  not be accepted in a court of law. However, I have known pickerel to  swallow frogs, crawfish, mice, sunfish and yellow perch with their  prickly dorsal fins, young shell-drakes and gulls, and even  bull-heads having three rigid horns with needle points projecting at  right angles to the body, any one of which horns, it would seem,  might pierce the anatomy of the pickerel. Somehow, they appear to get  away with all these things, and more.    The pickerel has a large mouth and a multitude of teeth on both upper  and lower jaws, in the roof of his mouth, also on tongue and palate.  These teeth are long and sharp and they slope inward; some of them  also bend down to allow objects to pass into the throat, but they  effectually prevent ejecting anything that has been swallowed. So,  Grandad Pickerel, if he had regrets after swallowing a member of his  own family, found it impossible to throw him up, as the Good Book  says the whale cast up Jonah.    Bige and I found we could not separate the two fishes without first  performing a surgical operation. In doing so, we also released a  shiner which had been swallowed with Bige's trolling hook and was  wedged in the throat alongside the smaller pickerel. This was the  most amazing part of the incident, and proves the gluttonous  character of the pickerel and his complete inability to appreciate  the limits of his own capacity.    We found upon examination that the process of digestion was  operating, and that the head of the smaller pickerel was nearly  dissolved in the stomach of the larger fish. Another hour, and  grandson would have slipped down an inch and the process of digestion  would have been repeated upon another section.    A white man cuts his fire wood the proper length to use in his  fireplace. An Indian puts one end of a long branch or sapling into  his fire, and when it has burned off, he moves the stick in and burns  off another section, thus conserving labor.    Our pickerel was digesting his food Indian fashion, or, so to speak,  on the installment plan.        BIGE and I were hunting. I was placed on a \"runway\" on the bank of a  small stream which was the outlet of Minnow Pond. Bige had gone  around to the opposite side of the mountain and planned to come up  over the top and follow the deer path which ran down the mountain  side, into and through an old log-road which had not been used for  lumber operations for fifteen years, and which was now overgrown with  bushes and young spruce and balsam trees. This log-road followed the  windings of the brook down the valley to where it emptied into the  lake, and where the logs were dumped into the water and floated down  to the mill.    Many years ago, when it was the practice to hunt with dogs, the deer  acquired the habit of running to the nearest water, where, by wading  or swimming they could throw the dogs off the scent. Thus all deer  trails or runways lead, sooner or later, to a stream, a pond or lake,  where the deer has a chance of evading pursuit of his natural enemy.  Now, while the game laws forbid hunting deer with dogs, and while  dogs are not allowed to enter forests inhabited by deer, yet the  inherited instinct of self-preservation of the latter persists, and  whenever alarmed by the appearance of man, who in the mind of a deer  is still associated with his other enemy--the dog, he immediately  starts down his trail to the nearest water.    It was Bige's hope to \"scare up\" a deer on the other side of the  mountain and drive him down the runway past my watch ground, while it  was my job to shoot him as he passed by.    The fallen tree on which I sat was on the bank of the brook and about  ten feet above the water, while in the opposite direction, through an  open space in the bushes, I had a clear view of the runway about  twenty yards distant.    Time passes slowly in the woods, when one is waiting for something to  turn up. Also, it is essential that one sit quietly and make very few  false motions when watching for a deer to approach. I had been  sitting, with rifle across knees, what seemed a long time. The noises  of the woods which suddenly cease when one walks through the forest,  gradually returned. A wood-pecker started up his electric hammer and  resumed the operation of drilling a deep hole into a pine stub a few  rods away. A blue-jay made some sarcastic remarks about \"Caleb\" and  then began swinging on his gate and creaking its rusty hinges. A red  squirrel overhead, made unintelligible, but evidently derisive  remarks about the intrusion of strangers, and then proceeded to cut  off spruce cones and tried to drop them on my head. A kingfisher flew  up the brook and shook a baby's tin rattle at me as he passed. An old  hen partridge down the log-road was advising her children to \"Quit!  Quit! Quit!\" but her chicks, who were now more than half grown, paid  not the slightest attention to her warning but continued picking  blue-berries just as if there were no enemies within a hundred miles.  An owl on the limb of a tall birch demanded, in stentorian voice, to  know \"Who? Who? Who in ----\" Another fellow, way down the valley  responded that he \"could!\", that he had a chip on his shoulder and  that if any blanked owl knocked it off he \"Would Who? Who in ---- are  you anyhow?\" Thus the belligerents fought their battle at long range  with language, like many other pugilists. A rabbit, who in another  month would throw off his brown vest and put on his white winter  overcoat, went loping past, stopping occasionally to nip off a  wintergreen leaf. These, and other sounds indicating various  activities of wood folk, continued to divert attention while two  hours passed.    The \"Yap, Yap,\" of a red fox sounded down the brook. A few minutes  later his voice was heard again, nearer; presently he came into view.  He was wading in the shallow water of the brook, eyes intently fixed  upon the water, following a school of minnows. Stepping high and  cautiously, he, from time to time, suddenly jabbed his muzzle into  the water and brought up a fish from two to three inches long, which  he chewed and swallowed with seeming satisfaction. When he missed,  which happened often, he repeated his impatient \"Yap, Yap\" and moved  up stream where was another bunch of minnows.    This was the first time I had ever seen a fox fishing and I was  intensely interested in his operations. About this time, I heard a  commotion in the bushes behind me, and turned in time to see the  horns and white tail of a deer over the tops of the bushes as he  bounded along down the runway. I heard him for a full minute, still  going strong down toward the lake.    Five minutes later Bige appeared, coming down the path gently  demanding, \"Why in time didn't you shoot that deer? I've been  following him for an hour. Fresh tracks all the way. Heard him twice.  He went right by here, kicked up the dirt at every jump. You won't  get a better shot in ten years. What in tunket were you doing  anyhow?\"    \"Who, me? Why-I-I was fishing.\"        \"BUTTERMILK FALLS\" is one of the show places in our neck of the  woods. The guide books make mention of it, and the tourist and \"one  week boarder\" see it first. Also, when one tires of fishing, of  mountain climbing, of tramping, and is in need of some new form of  diversion, there is always \"somethin' doin' at the falls.\" In the  presence of their majestic beauty, and in the roar of their falling,  tumbling, foaming waters, deer seem to lose their natural timidity  and often, in mid-day, show themselves in the open to drink of the  waters at the foot of the falls and to drink in the beauty of the  picture. In the course of my wanderings in the forests, I have often  observed, in spots that are particularly wild or picturesque, or that  have an extensive outlook, evidences that deer have stood there,  perhaps stamping or pawing the ground for hours at a time, while they  enjoyed the view. Such evidence points to the theory that wild deer  not only have an eye for the beautiful in nature, but that they  manifest good taste in their choice of a picture.    One day two black bears were seen feeding on the bank of the river  just above the falls. A family of beavers have built a house about a  hundred yards below the falls and have made several unsuccessful  attempts to dam the rapids, in which operations about an acre of  alder bushes have been cut and dragged into position, only to be  carried down stream by the swift waters. This is the only family of  beavers I ever met who are not good engineers.    There is also the typical tale of the \"_big trout_--a perfect monster  of a fish,\" that lives in the deep pool under the falls."]]]
