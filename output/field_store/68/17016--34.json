It is an error to speak of  man \"tampering with nature\" and causing variability. If a man drops a piece  of iron into sulphuric acid, it cannot be said strictly that he makes the  sulphate of iron, he only allows their elective affinities to come into  play. If organic beings had not possessed an inherent tendency to vary, man  could have done nothing. (Introduction/2. M. Pouchet has recently  ('Plurality of Races' English Translation 1864 page 83 etc.) insisted that  variation under domestication throws no light on the natural modification  of species. I cannot perceive the force of his arguments, or, to speak more  accurately, of his assertions to this effect.) He unintentionally exposes  his animals and plants to various conditions of life, and variability  supervenes, which he cannot even prevent or check. Consider the simple case  of a plant which has been cultivated during a long time in its native  country, and which consequently has not been subjected to any change of  climate. It has been protected to a certain extent from the competing roots  of plants of other kinds; it has generally been grown in manured soil; but  probably not richer than that of many an alluvial flat; and lastly, it has  been exposed to changes in its conditions, being grown sometimes in one  district and sometimes in another, in different soils. Under such  circumstances, scarcely a plant can be named, though cultivated in the  rudest manner, which has not given birth to several varieties. It can  hardly be maintained that during the many changes which this earth has  undergone, and during the natural migrations of plants from one land or  island to another, tenanted by different species, that such plants will not  often have been subjected to changes in their conditions analogous to those  which almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary. No doubt man  selects varying individuals, sows their seeds, and again selects their  varying offspring. But the initial variation on which man works, and  without which he can do nothing, is caused by slight changes in the  conditions of life, which must often have occurred under nature. Man,  therefore, may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic  scale; and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of time  has incessantly tried. Hence it follows that the principles of  domestication are important for us. The main result is that organic beings  thus treated have varied largely, and the variations have been inherited.  This has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long held by some  few naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo change.    I shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the whole  subject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to obtain some  light, little though it be, on the causes of variability,--on the laws  which govern it, such as the direct action of climate and food, the effects  of use and disuse, and of correlation of growth,--and on the amount of  change to which domesticated organisms are liable. We shall learn something  of the laws of inheritance, of the effects of crossing different breeds,  and on that sterility which often supervenes when organic beings are  removed from their natural conditions of life, and likewise when they are  too closely interbred. During this investigation we shall see that the  principle of Selection is highly important. Although man does not cause  variability and cannot even prevent it, he can select, preserve, and  accumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature almost in any  way which he chooses; and thus he can certainly produce a great result.  Selection may be followed either methodically and intentionally, or  unconsciously and unintentionally. Man may select and preserve each  successive variation, with the distinct intention of improving and altering  a breed, in accordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up  variations, often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he  has effected wonderful changes and improvements. It can, also, be clearly  shown that man, without any intention or thought of improving the breed, by  preserving in each successive generation the individuals which he prizes  most, and by destroying the worthless individuals, slowly, though surely,  induces great changes. As the will of man thus comes into play, we can  understand how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants  and pleasures. We can further understand how it is that domestic races of  animals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal character,  as compared with natural species; for they have been modified not for their  own benefit, but for that of man.    In another work I shall discuss, if time and health permit, the variability  of organic beings in a state of nature; namely, the individual differences  presented by animals and plants, and those slightly greater and generally  inherited differences which are ranked by naturalists as varieties or  geographical races. We shall see how difficult, or rather how impossible it  often is, to distinguish between races and sub-species, as the less well-  marked forms have sometimes been denominated; and again between sub-species  and true species. I shall further attempt to show that it is the common and  widely ranging, or, as they may be called, the dominant species, which most  frequently vary; and that it is the large and flourishing genera which  include the greatest number of varying species. Varieties, as we shall see,  may justly be called incipient species.    But it may be urged, granting that organic beings in a state of nature  present some varieties,--that their organisation is in some slight degree  plastic; granting that many animals and plants have varied greatly under  domestication, and that man by his power of selection has gone on  accumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked and firmly  inherited races; granting all this, how, it may be asked, have species  arisen in a state of nature? The differences between natural varieties are  slight; whereas the differences are considerable between the species of the  same genus, and great between the species of distinct genera. How do these  lesser differences become augmented into the greater difference? How do  varieties, or as I have called them incipient species, become converted  into true and well-defined species? How has each new species been adapted  to the surrounding physical conditions, and to the other forms of life on  which it in any way depends? We see on every side of us innumerable  adaptations and contrivances, which have justly excited the highest  admiration of every observer. There is, for instance, a fly (Cecidomyia  (Introduction/3. Leon Dufour in 'Annales des Science. Nat.' (3rd series,  Zoolog.) tome 5 page 6.)) which deposits its eggs within the stamens of a  Scrophularia, and secretes a poison which produces a gall, on which the  larva feeds; but there is another insect (Misocampus) which deposits its  eggs within the body of the larva within the gall, and is thus nourished by  its living prey; so that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous  insect, and this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a  particular organ of a particular plant. So it is, in a more or less plainly  marked manner, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases, with the lowest  as well as with the highest productions of nature.    This problem of the conversion of varieties into species,--that is, the  augmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into the  greater differences characteristic of species and genera, including the  admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic  conditions of life,--has been briefly treated in my 'Origin of Species.' It  was there shown that all organic beings, without exception, tend to  increase at so high a ratio, that no district, no station, not even the  whole surface of the land or the whole ocean, would hold the progeny of a  single pair after a certain number of generations. The inevitable result is  an ever-recurrent Struggle for Existence. It has truly been said that all  nature is at war; the strongest ultimately prevail, the weakest fail; and  we well know that myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the  earth. If then organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight  degree, owing to changes in the surrounding conditions, of which we have  abundant geological evidence, or from any other cause; if, in the long  course of ages, inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous  to any being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life;  and it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise,  seeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his own  profit or pleasure; if then these contingencies ever occur, and I do not  see how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted, then the severe  and often-recurrent struggle for existence will determine that those  variations, however slight, which are favourable shall be preserved or  selected, and those which are unfavourable shall be destroyed.    This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess  any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called  Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea  by the Survival of the Fittest. The term \"natural selection\" is in some  respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be  disregarded after a little familiarity. No one objects to chemists speaking  of \"elective affinity;\" and certainly an acid has no more choice in  combining with a base, than the conditions of life have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#3)"],[1,"the fun,  her arm bound up.    \"Now,\" cried the old Count, when the banquet was over, \"I ask one  favour of all--and that is that you drink to the health of our great  Emperor.\" He rose and lifted his glass, assuming that all would  drink. But that was a bit too much for Thaddeus! The Emperor was the  enemy of Poland. Most certainly he would not drink--not even to save  his life.    Florestein, who was always doing everything but what he ought, walked  up to Thaddeus and pointed out his glass to him.    \"Your fine acquaintance, uncle, is not overburdened with politeness,  it seems to me. He does not respond to your wishes.\"    \"What--does he not drink to the Emperor? My friend, I challenge you to  drink this health.\" The old Count filled Thaddeus's glass and handed  it to him.    \"And thus I accept the challenge,\" Thaddeus cried; and before  Devilshoof or any one else could stop him, the reckless chap went up  to the statue of the Emperor and dashed the wine in its face.    This was the signal for a great uproar. The man who has dared insult  the Emperor must be punished. The nobles made a dash for him, but the  old Count was under an obligation too great to abandon Thaddeus yet.  He tried to silence the enraged guests for a moment, and then said  aside to Thaddeus:    \"Go, I beg of you, your life is not worth a breath if you remain here.  I cannot protect you--and indeed I ought not. Go at once,\" and he  threw Thaddeus a purse of gold, meaning thus to reward him, and get  him away quickly. Thaddeus immediately threw the purse amidst the  nobles who were threatening him, and shouted:    \"I am one whom gold cannot reward!\" At that the angry men rushed upon  him, but Devilshoof stood shoulder to shoulder with Thaddeus.    \"Now, then, good folks, come on! I guess together we can give you a  pretty interesting fight, if it's fighting you are after!\" A scrimmage  was just in Devilshoof's line, and once and forever he declared  himself the champion of his new comrade.    \"Really, this is too bad,\" Florestein whimpered, standing at the table  with the bone of a pheasant in one hand and a glass of wine in the  other. \"Just as a man is enjoying his dinner, a boor like this comes  along and interrupts him.\" But by that time the fight was on, and  Thaddeus and Devilshoof were against the lot. The old Count ordered  his retainers to separate the nobles and the gipsies, and then had  Devilshoof bound and carried into the castle. Thaddeus was escorted  off by another path.    The row was over and the nobles seated themselves again at the table.  The nurse, who had Arline at the window, now left her nursling and  came down to speak with the Count.    Immediately after she left the castle chamber, Devilshoof could be  seen scrambling over the castle roof, having escaped from the room in  which he was confined. Reaching the window where Arline was left, he  closed it. The nurse had been gone only a moment, when she reentered  the room. Whatever had taken place in her absence caused her to scream  frightfully. The whole company started up again, while the nurse threw  open the window and leaned out, crying:    \"Arline is gone--stolen--help, help!\" All dashed into the castle.  Presently some of the nobles came to the window and motioned to those  left outside. It was quite true. Arline was gone. Out they all rushed  again. Every one in the place had gone distracted. The poor old  Count's grief was pitiable. At that moment Devilshoof could be seen  triumphantly mounting the rocks, with Arline in his arms. He had  avenged his comrade Thaddeus.    All at once the crowd saw the great gipsy leaping from rock to rock  with the little child in his arms, and with a roar they started after  him. Then Devilshoof seemed fairly to fly over the rocks, but the  crowd gained upon him, till they reached a bridge which spanned a deep  chasm; there Devilshoof paused; he was over, and with one tremendous  effort he knocked from under the structure the trunk of a tree which  supported the far end of the bridge, and down it went! The fall of  timbers echoed back with Devilshoof's shout of laughter as he sped up  the mountain with Arline.    The old Count ran to the chasm to throw himself headlong into it, but  his friends held him back.      ACT II    Twelve years after that day of the hunt in Count Arnheim's forests,  the gipsies were encamped in Presburg. In those strange times gipsies  roved about in the cities as well as in the fields and forests, and it  was not at all strange to find the same old band encamped thus in the  public street of a city. There, the gipsy queen had pitched her tent,  and through its open curtains Arline could be seen lying upon a  tiger's skin, while Thaddeus, who had never left the band, watched  over her. There were houses on the opposite side of the street, and  the gipsy queen's tent was lighted only dimly with a lamp that swung  at the back, just before some curtains that formed a partition in the  tent.    It was all quiet when the city patrol went by, and they had no sooner  passed than Devilshoof entered the street, followed by others of the  gipsy band, all wrapped in their dark cloaks.    \"The moon is the only one awake now,\" they sang. \"There is some fine  business on foot, when the moon herself goes to bed,\" and they all  drew their daggers. But Devilshoof, who was a pretty decent fellow,  and who didn't believe in killing, whispered:    \"Fie! Fie! When you are going to rob a gentleman, you shouldn't draw a  knife on him. He will be too polite to refuse anything you may ask, if  you ask politely\"--which was Devilshoof's idea of wit. There was a  hotel across the street, and one of the gipsies pointed to a light in  its windows.    \"It will be easy when our fine gentlemen have been drinking long  enough. They won't know their heads from their heels.\" They stole off  chuckling, to wait till they imagined every one to be asleep, but they  were no sooner gone than Florestein, that funny little fop who never  had thought of anything more serious than his appearance, reeled out  of the hotel. He was dressed all in his good clothes, and wore golden  chains about his neck--to one of which was attached a fine medallion.  Rings glittered on his fingers, and altogether, with his plumes and  furbelows, he was precisely the sort of thing Devilshoof and his  companions were looking for. He was so very drunk that he could not  imagine what a fool he was making of himself, and so he began to sing:         Wine, wine, if I am heir,         To the count, my uncle's line;         Wine, wine, wine,       Where's the fellow will dare         To refuse his nephew wine?    This excellent song was punctuated by hiccoughs. There was another  stanza which rebuked the boldness of the moon--in short, mentioned the  shortcomings of most people compared to this elegant fellow's.  Altogether, he was a very funny joke to the gipsies who were waiting  for him and peering and laughing from round a corner as he sang. Then  Devilshoof went up to him with mock politeness. He bowed very  seriously.         My ear caught not the clock's last chime,       And might I beg to ask the time?    Florestein, even though he was drunk, was half alive to his danger. He  hadn't enough courage to survive a sudden sneeze. So he braced up a  little and eyed Devilshoof:         If the bottle has prevailed,       Yet whenever I'm assailed,       Though there may be nothing in it,       I am sobered in a minute.    One could see that this was quite true. Florestein was a good deal  worried. He took out his watch, and assured Devilshoof that it was  quite late.         I am really grieved to see         Any one in such a state,       And gladly will take the greatest care         Of the rings and chains you chance to wear,    Devilshoof said still more politely; and bowing all of the time he  removed the ornaments from Florestein's person.         What I thought was politeness, is downright theft,       And at this rate I soon shall have nothing left,    the unfortunate dandy moaned, clutching his gewgaws hopelessly, while  all the gipsies beset him, each taking all he could for himself. But  Devilshoof having secured the medallion, made off with it. He was no  sooner gone than a dark woman wrapped in a cloak came into the street  and, when she was right in the midst of the squabble, she dropped her  cloak and revealed herself as Queen of the band. All the gipsies were  amazed and not very comfortable either!--because, strange to say, this  gipsy queen did not approve of the maraudings of her band; and when  she caught them at thievery she punished them.    \"Return those things you have stolen,\" she commanded, and they made  haste to do so, while the trembling Florestein took a hurried  inventory of his property. But among the things returned, he didn't  find the medallion.    \"I'm much obliged to you, Madame, whoever you are, but I'd like a  medallion that they have taken, returned.\"    \"That belongs to the chief--Devilshoof,\" they cried.    \"I'll answer for your safety,\" the Queen said to Florestein, who was  not overmuch reassured by this, but still tried to make the best of  things. \"Now follow me,\" she called the band, and went, holding  Florestein and dragging him with her.    They had no sooner gone than Arline, who had been awakened by the  noise outside the tent, came out into the street. Thaddeus followed  her. She was greatly disturbed.    \"Thaddeus,\" she said, \"I have had a strange dream\":    [Music:         I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls,         With vassals and serfs at my side,       And of all who assembled within those walls,         That I was the joy and the pride.]         I had riches too great to count;--could boast         Of a high ancestral name;       But I also dreamt (which pleased me most)         That you loved me still the same.         I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,         That knights upon bended knee"]]]
