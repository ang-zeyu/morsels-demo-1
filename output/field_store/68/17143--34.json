The arrangement of the Suras in this translation is based partly upon the  traditions of the Muhammadans themselves, with reference especially to the  ancient chronological list printed by Weil in his Mohammed der Prophet, as  well as upon a careful consideration of the subject matter of each separate  Sura and its probable connection with the sequence of events in the life of  Muhammad. Great attention has been paid to this subject by Dr. Weil in the  work just mentioned; by Mr. Muir in his Life of Mahomet, who also publishes a  chronological list of Suras, 21 however of which he admits have \"not yet been  carefully fixed;\" and especially by Nöldeke, in his Geschichte des Qôrans, a  work to which public honours were awarded in 1859 by the Paris Academy of  Inscriptions. From the arrangement of this author I see no reason to depart  in regard to the later Suras. It is based upon a searching criticism and  minute analysis of the component verses of each, and may be safely taken as a  standard, which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons. I  have, however, placed the earlier and more fragmentary Suras, after the two  first, in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than to  points of historical allusion, which in these Suras are very few; whilst on  the other hand, they are mainly couched in the language of self-communion, of  aspirations after truth, and of mental struggle, are vivid pictures of Heaven  and Hell, or descriptions of natural objects, and refer also largely to the  opposition met with by Muhammad from his townsmen of Mecca at the outset of  his public career. This remark applies to what Nöldeke terms \"the Suras of  the First Period.\"    The contrast between the earlier, middle, and later Suras is very striking  and interesting, and will be at once apparent from the arrangement here  adopted. In the Suras as far as the 54th, p. 76, we cannot but notice the  entire predominance of the poetical element, a deep appreciation (as in Sura  xci. p. 38) of the beauty of natural objects, brief fragmentary and  impassioned utterances, denunciations of woe and punishment, expressed for  the most part in lines of extreme brevity. With a change, however, in the  position of Muhammad when he openly assumes the office of \"public warner,\"  the Suras begin to assume a more prosaic and didactic tone, though the  poetical ornament of rhyme is preserved throughout. We gradually lose the  Poet in the missionary aiming to convert, the warm asserter of dogmatic  truths; the descriptions of natural objects, of the judgment, of Heaven and  Hell, make way for gradually increasing historical statements, first from  Jewish, and subsequently from Christian histories; while, in the 29 Suras  revealed at Medina, we no longer listen to vague words, often as it would  seem without positive aim, but to the earnest disputant with the enemies of  his faith, the Apostle pleading the cause of what he believes to be the Truth  of God. He who at Mecca is the admonisher and persuader, at Medina is the  legislator and the warrior, who dictates obedience, and uses other weapons  than the pen of the Poet and the Scribe. When business pressed, as at Medina,  Poetry makes way for Prose, and although touches of the Poetical element  occasionally break forth, and he has to defend himself up to a very late  period against the charge of being merely a Poet, yet this is rarely the case  in the Medina Suras; and we are startled by finding obedience to God and the  Apostle, God's gifts and the Apostle's, God's pleasure and the Apostle's,  spoken of in the same breath, and epithets and attributes elsewhere applied  to Allah openly applied to himself as in Sura ix., 118, 129.    The Suras, viewed as a whole, strike me as being the work of one who began  his career as a thoughtful enquirer after truth, and an earnest asserter of  it in such rhetorical and poetical forms as he deemed most likely to win and  attract his countrymen, and who gradually proceeded from the dogmatic teacher  to the politic founder of a system for which laws and regulations had to be  provided as occasions arose. And of all the Suras it must be remarked that  they were intended not for readers but for hearersthat they were all  promulgated by public recitaland that much was left, as the imperfect  sentences shew, to the manner and suggestive action of the reciter. It would  be impossible, and indeed it is unnecessary, to attempt a detailed life of  Muhammad within the narrow limits of a Preface. The main events thereof with  which the Suras of the Koran stand in connection, areThe visions of Gabriel,  seen, or said to have been seen, at the outset of his career in his 40th  year, during one of his seasons of annual monthly retirement, for devotion  and meditation to Mount Hirâ, near Mecca,the period of mental depression and  re-assurance previous to the assumption of the office of public teacherthe  Fatrah or pause (see n. p. 20) during which he probably waited for a  repetition of the angelic visionhis labours in comparative privacy for three  years, issuing in about 40 converts, of whom his wife Chadijah was the first,  and Abu Bekr the most important: (for it is to him and to Abu Jahl the Sura  xcii. p. 32, refers)struggles with Meccan unbelief and idolatry followed by  a period during which probably he had the second vision, Sura liii. p. 69,  and was listened to and respected as a person \"possessed\" (Sura lxix. 42, p.  60, lii. 29, p. 64)the first emigration to Abyssinia in A.D. 616, in  consequence of the Meccan persecutions brought on by his now open attacks  upon idolatry (Taghout)increasing reference to Jewish and Christian  histories, shewing that much time had been devoted to their study the  conversion of Omar in 617the journey to the Thaquifites at Taief in A.D.  620the intercourse with pilgrims from Medina, who believed in Islam, and  spread the knowledge thereof in their native town, in the same yearthe  vision of the midnight journey to Jerusalem and the Heavensthe meetings by  night at Acaba, a mountain near Mecca, in the 11th year of his mission, and  the pledges of fealty there given to himthe command given to the believers  to emigrate to Yathrib, henceforth Medinat-en-nabi (the city of the Prophet)  or El-Medina (the city), in April of A.D. 622the escape of Muhammad and Abu  Bekr from Mecca to the cave of Thaurthe FLIGHT to Medina in June 20, A.D.  622treaties made with Christian tribesincreasing, but still very imperfect  acquaintance with Christian doctrinesthe Battle of Bedr in Hej. 2, and of  Ohodthe coalition formed against Muhammad by the Jews and idolatrous  Arabians, issuing in the siege of Medina, Hej. 5 (A.D. 627)the convention,  with reference to the liberty of making the pilgrimage, of Hudaibiya, Hej. 6  the embassy to Chosroes King of Persia in the same year, to the Governor of  Egypt and to the King of Abyssinia, desiring them to embrace Islamthe  conquest of several Jewish tribes, the most important of which was that of  Chaibar in Hej. 7, a year marked by the embassy sent to Heraclius, then in  Syria, on his return from the Persian campaign, and by a solemn and peaceful  pilgrimage to Meccathe triumphant entry into Mecca in Hej. 8 (A.D. 630), and  the demolition of the idols of the Caabathe submission of the Christians of  Nedjran, of Aila on the Red Sea, and of Taief, etc., in Hej. 9, called \"the  year of embassies or deputations,\" from the numerous deputations which  flocked to Mecca proffering submissionand lastly in Hej. 10, the submission  of Hadramont, Yemen, the greater part of the southern and eastern provinces  of Arabiaand the final solemn pilgrimage to Mecca.    While, however, there is no great difficulty in ascertaining the Suras which  stand in connection with the more salient features of Muhammad's life, it is  a much more arduous, and often impracticable task, to point out the precise  events to which individual verses refer, and out of which they sprung. It is  quite possible that Muhammad himself, in a later period of his career,  designedly mixed up later with earlier revelations in the same Suras not for  the sake of producing that mysterious style which seems so pleasing to the  mind of those who value truth least when it is most clear and obvious but for  the purpose of softening down some of the earlier statements which represent  the last hour and awful judgment as imminent; and thus leading his followers  to continue still in the attitude of expectation, and to see in his later  successes the truth of his earlier predictions. If after-thoughts of this  kind are to be traced, and they will often strike the attentive reader, it  then follows that the perplexed state of the text in individual Suras is to  be considered as due to Muhammad himself, and we are furnished with a series  of constant hints for attaining to chronological accuracy. And it may be  remarked in passing, that a belief that the end of all things was at hand,  may have tended to promote the earlier successes of Islam at Mecca, as it  unquestionably was an argument with the Apostles, to flee from \"the wrath to  come.\" It must be borne in mind that the allusions to contemporary minor  events, and to the local efforts made by the new religion to gain the  ascendant are very few, and often couched in terms so vague and general, that  we are forced to interpret the Koran solely by the Koran itself. And for  this, the frequent repetitions of the same histories and the same sentiments,  afford much facility: and the peculiar manner in which the details of each  history are increased by fresh traits at each recurrence, enables us to trace  their growth in the author's mind, and to ascertain the manner in which a  part of the Koran was composed.

None of the trees examined for growth rings reflected the annual  precipitation accurately for long periods though some indication of  known drought periods or of series of wet years were usually  discernible.    For 35 black oaks, chestnut oaks, and American elms, growth rings  averaged 3.81 per inch of trunk diameter (according to size of the  tree; 5.1 rings per inch in those trees 9 to 12 inches in diameter,  4.0 in those 13 to 15 inches, 3.6 in those 16 to 24 inches, and 2.8 in  those of more than 24 inches). Data from a few complete counts and  many incomplete counts indicate that in _Gleditsia triacanthos_ growth  is much more rapid, with only 2 to 3 rings per inch of trunk diameter,  whereas in _Juglans nigra_, _Celtis occidentalis_, _Carya ovata_, and  _Fraxinus americana_ growth is much slower, with usually five or more  growth rings per inch of trunk diameter. Individual trees deviate  widely from the average for their species, and those in rich  bottomland soil grow more rapidly than those in shallow soil of  hilltops or those on rocky slopes. If such factors are taken into  account the ages of trees may be estimated from the diameters of their  trunks. In mature trees growth slows; age is likely to be  underestimated rather than overestimated in those of exceptionally  large size.    The belief that this and similar areas in northeastern Kansas were  virtually treeless at the time of occupation by white settlers is  shown to be wholly unfounded by the information obtained from growth  rings. The ring counts show that many trees now growing on the area  and others cut within the last 30 years, but still represented by  stumps, were already present in the eighteen sixties when the area was  first occupied. A few trees on the area probably are much older,  dating back to the early eighteen hundreds. As there are no virgin  stands of timber, and the more valuable trees have been removed by  selective cutting at various times, it is to be expected that there  are few or no trees on the area approaching the potential longevity  for their species.    The many oaks and elms on the area that are more than two feet in  trunk diameter mostly date back to the eighteen sixties or earlier.  The distribution of the larger trees and stumps provides a clue as to  the original distribution of forest and grassland on the area. There  is no description available of the area that is now the Reservation in  its original condition. However, Mrs. Anna Morgan Ward (1945) has  recorded comments on the appearance of the country in the section of  land adjoining the Reservation on the south, as it appeared when her  family settled there in 1864. This land differed from that of the  Reservation, as it consists of low rolling hills, well drained with  predominately south exposure, and with sandy soil. It adjoins the  present flood plain of the Kansas River, and consists partly of the  old Menoken Terrace deposited in the Pleistocene. The following  excerpts from Mrs. Ward's manuscript are selected as most descriptive  of the original vegetation on this section of land.    [In southwest part of section near the Morgan house.] \"... some hills  that were covered with Jack Oak trees ... Here we found wild  strawberries on the hillsides. And along the creeks we located  gooseberry bushes, wild grapes, both summer and winter grapes, plums,  and paw paws in the fall. We found a crabapple tree ... Plenty of  walnuts and hazel nuts.\"    [Hilly south-central part of section, the J. P. Whitney farm.] \"... on  a hill among many small trees ... especially on the east were many  trees.\"    [Less hilly southeastern part of section.] \"... Was open prairie and  free grazing ground for many years....\"    Much of the land in this section is now under cultivation but there  are still hilltop groves of blackjack oak, probably in about the same  places where Mrs Ward noticed them 90 years ago--south of the house  that was formerly Robinson's residence, and west across the county  road, beside the Oakridge School building, and on other knolls to the  east and southeast.    The bottomland areas of the Reservation are mainly grassland and no  old stumps remain to indicate that trees were formerly present.  Nevertheless, it might be expected that under original conditions  these bottomland areas supported forests, as the soil is deep and rich  with abundant moisture. Also most of the early accounts agree that  forests occurred mainly along stream courses in this region.  Presumably these areas were cut over early, because they were most  accessible, and because they supported the best stands of timber.    One of the best indications of the former vegetation on these  bottomland areas is provided by old bleached shells of snails and  certain other mollusks, brought to the surface by plowing in  cultivated fields adjoining the Reservation on the south and west  (Fitch and Lokke, 1956). A high proportion of the shells are of  species limited to humus soil, decaying logs, or leaf litter in moist  woodlands (_Stenotrema leai_, _Retinella electrina_, _Zonitoides  arboreus_, _Vertigo ovata_, _Helicodiscus parallelus_), to wet places  (_Lymnaea parva_, _Succinea avara_) or even to standing pools (_Physa  hawni_, _Helisoma trivolvis_, _Pisidium compressum_). No living  mollusks could be found in these fields and none could be expected to  survive on land that is cultivated annually. As a whole the assemblage  seems to be indicative of a humid, poorly drained forest habitat.  Presumably most of the shells or all of them are more than 100 years  old, antedating the time when the area was first disturbed by human  activities, and also antedating the time when the creeks (now 15 feet  or more below the fields) had begun to erode their channels. That the  shell deposits are of no great antiquity, and represent conditions  prevailing within the last few hundred years, is suggested by the fact  that all are species still living in Douglas County, and with one  exception, all still live on the Reservation.      [Illustration: Fig. 3. Tracing from a contour map made in 1914,        of the two small valleys on the Reservation, showing changed        position of contour lines at gullies by 1952. As a result of        overgrazing, and cultivation of part of the upland drainage        area, there was relatively rapid erosion in the 38-year        interval.]      [Illustration: Fig. 4. Map of University of Kansas Natural        History Reservation, with 20-foot contours, showing probable        approximate distribution of forest in early eighteen hundreds        (vertical lines show slopes and hilltops that are still wooded;        grid pattern shows bottomlands that were formerly wooded but        later cleared for pasture or cultivated crops). Stippled areas        show those slopes and hilltops now wooded seemingly as a result        of recent reinvasion, that probably were bluestem prairie        earlier. Unshaded areas are relatively flat hilltops that are        still grassland and are thought to have been bluestem prairie.]    Mrs. Ward (_op. cit._) in her manuscript concerning the early history  of Grant Township, mentioned the small creek that drains the east part  of the Reservation. Evidently in the sixties it had a more constant  flow, usually with clear water. Later it eroded its channel, cutting a  deep gully. Presumably the water table has been much lowered. In his  verbal reminiscences of the area, Mr. J. F. Morgan told us that in the  nineties this stream had eroded its channel but little within the  present limits of the Reservation. In a period of years, 1902 to 1905  inclusive, when there was abnormally heavy rainfall, severe erosion  occurred, and the saturated soil of several hillside areas slipped  downhill to the extent of several feet vertical displacement. The  ravine draining into the present pond from the north was known as  \"Sunken Canyon\" because of such soil slips. However, a map of the  Reservation and surrounding areas made by the University of Kansas  Department of Civil Engineering in 1914, shows that by that time  relatively little gullying had occurred. Comparison of this contour  map with a more detailed one prepared in 1952 shows that the gullies  had eroded their channels to depths more than 15 feet greater in some  places, in the 38-year interval (Fig. 3). In June and July, 1951, when  there was unusually heavy rainfall, gullies deepened perceptibly.  Dozens of trees including many large mature elms, honey locusts, and  osage orange, growing along the banks were undermined and fell into  the gullies.          Composition of the Forest      Under present conditions, every one of the larger tree species  dominates at least some small part of the area. For reasons that are  usually obscure, locations that seem otherwise similar differ in the  kinds, numbers, and sizes of trees they support. Probably most of  these differences have arisen in the varying treatments under human  occupation in the last 100 years.    In the two valley areas, presumably heavily wooded under primitive  conditions, the trees growing at present seem to be secondary  invaders. They include groves and isolated trees of elm, honey locust,  walnut, and osage orange, and an occasional red haw, hackberry, or  coffee-tree.    The hilltops likewise are chiefly open, but forest of the hillsides  encroaches onto them for as much as 100 yards in some places. The  slopes between the hilltops and the valleys are almost everywhere  wooded, but the aspect of the woods changes from place to place.  Subdivisions on a vertical scale, might be recognized as follows: the  upper limestone outcrop (Plattsmouth member) at the hilltop; the  usually steep slope strewn with rocks, between the upper and lower  (Toronto) limestone outcrop; the lower limestone outcrop; an almost  level terracelike formation often approximately 50 feet wide a"]]]
