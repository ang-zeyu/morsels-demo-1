This was due in part to the fact that there  was no great demand for such an accessory and in part to the clumsiness  of all those revolving eye-pieces which changed the entire ocular. The  latter of these difficulties has been overcome in our present revolving  eye-piece by such an adjustment of the collecting or lower lens of the  eye-piece that it may remain permanently in position, the eye lens of  the combination alone moving in the revolver. So accurate is the  construction of the revolver and so carefully are the lenses adjusted  that the eye-pieces may be changed while a specimen is in focus on the  microscope stage without a readjustment of the focus.    The revolving eye-piece is also particularly well adapted to use as a  micrometer ocular, for when the eye lens is turned aside a micrometer  scale may be inserted and rests upon the diaphragm of the eye-piece.  Once adjusted in this way the micrometer values are the same for all the  eye lenses of the combination.                                                                    $    Prices: =Double revolving Eye-piece=, without eye lenses    =4.--=             Each eye lens                                      =1.25=            =Eye-piece Micrometer=, No. 86                      =2.--=            =Stands.=      For the past thirty years division of labor has been employed to the  utmost possible extent in the manufacture of our microscopes. This  principle has been applied to our machinery as well as to our workmen,  with the result that we have gradually accumulated a large plant of  special machinery of the most accurate construction, each machine  especially adapted to the manufacture of some particular part of our  microscopes. By this development of mechanical appliances for microscope  manufacture two ends have been attained:--The greatest accuracy and  uniformity of construction of our microscopes has been made possible,  while at the same time it has been possible to cheapen the cost of  manufacture. Instruments which are the product of delicate machinery  must always be more uniform, more accurate and should be less costly  than those manufactured by hand.    In the following remarks we refer more particularly to the larger  microscope stands of our manufacture and draw attention to those  parts which should be present in every well equipped microscope.    The elements of these microscopes are:        1. =The foot and upright support with joint for inclination=,      2. =The stage=,      3. =The sub-stage, with condenser, iris diaphragm and mirror=,      4. =The body with the adjustments=,      5. =The tube, carrying eye-piece, nose-piece and objectives=.    1. =The foot and upright support= are solid and are of such weight and  shape as to permit inclination of the body of the microscope to a  horizontal position. The foot is horse-shoe shaped and is made to touch  the table at three points, thus insuring stability even on a surface  which is not entirely level. Inclination of the body of the microscope  is permitted by a joint in the upright, which joint may be fastened in  the larger stands by a set-screw operated by a lever. Stands Ia and IIb  are also made with the English foot. Abundant space is left under the  stage for the various attachments of the sub-stage.    2. =The stage= of Stands A, I, Ia and II is round, revolving and  centering. The centering arrangement consists of two small thumb-screws  so situated at the sides of the stage as to control motion of the stage  in all directions, thus to a limited extent serving the purpose of a  mechanical stage.    =The other microscope= stands have square immovable stages, sufficiently  large for general microscopic work. For the examination of very large  sections two instruments are manufactured: the _Nebelthau_ sliding  microscope (p. 50) and the stand after _Doelken_ (p. 52). The former is  for magnifications up to 120 diam, whereas the latter can be used with  any magnification.    3. =The sub-stage= carries a plane and concave mirror, the condenser and  the diaphragm for regulating the illumination of the object.    =The Condenser= is so adjusted as to concentrate the rays of light about 2  mm above its surface, which is the average thickness of the microscopic  slides, under an angle equal to the angular aperture of the highest  power objective, which is about 120 deg.    In the lower power objectives the angular aperture is to be reduced by  the iris diaphragm.    To focus the Condenser properly it is adjustable by rack and pinion  movement on Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, and by side screw on Stands II and IIa.    4. =The body= of the microscope carries the tube and is fitted with two  adjustments for focussing; a coarse adjustment and a fine adjustment.  The smooth working of these adjustments is one of the chief requirements  of a good microscope.    =The coarse adjustment= consists of rack and pinion and moves the tube of  the microscope in a vertical groove with the least possible friction.  The teeth of the rack and pinion are set obliquely to the axis of the  tube and are so adjusted that two teeth of each are always interlocked,  thus avoiding all possibility of slipping or loss of motion in the  movement.    [Illustration: Figure of the Micrometer-screw of the fine adjustment.]    =The fine adjustment= consists of a micrometer screw which moves the tube  and arm of the microscope supporting the coarse adjustment vertically  upon a triangular column. This column is virtually a continuation upward  of the upright support of the base of the microscope. Around the column  is a broad collar so accurately fitted that it moves smoothly upon it  with a minimum of friction and still without lateral motion, the  movement being controlled by means of a micrometer screw at the top of  the column. The head of this micrometer screw, a section of which is  shown in the accompanying figure, is milled and is graduated in such a  way as to indicate the exact degree of motion of the microscope tube  which is accomplished by turning the micrometer screw, each division of  the graduation corresponding to a motion of the tube through 1/100  millimeter, and a complete revolution of the screw corresponding to a  motion of the tube through 1/2 millimeter. The accuracy of this adjustment  and the smoothness of its motion must be conceded to be a triumph of  mechanical skill.    =Stands A.= and =I.= are fitted with a =new fine adjustment= device (one  division on the micrometer screw corresponding to 1/1000 mm.) which is  fully described on pages 25-26.    5. =The tube= of the microscope encloses a second tube, or draw-tube,  which latter carries the eye-piece, and is so graduated as to indicate  the exact length of tube in use at any time. The lower end of the tube  has a thread into which the various objectives or a nose-piece screw.  Tube and objectives are provided with the so-called \"Society screw\".    =The nose-piece= has now become an almost indispensable part of a working  microscope. It can, however, be used to best advantage only on such  stands as are provided with a coarse adjustment by rack and pinion.  Aside from the advantage derived from the rapid changing of objectives,  which it permits, it is so accurately made and centered as to materially  facilitate the focussing of the various objectives. It is only necessary  to focus with the fine adjustment to obtain a view of the same  microscope field which had been under observation before the change was  made.    As it is necessary for this purpose that the objectives should be  accurately adjusted to the nose-piece, it is very desirable that in  ordering an instrument its nose-piece should be ordered at the same time  if one is to be used, as subsequent ordering may necessitate the return  of the stand and objectives to us.    =Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb and III= are those which are best  suited to fine microscopical investigations. Among them the physician  and bacteriologist will find an instrument entirely suited to his  particular needs.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35937"],[0,"Are the Planets Inhabited? (#3)"],[1," a living individual, wherein highly complex and unstable compounds  are unceasingly undergoing chemical reactions, a metabolism essentially  associated with protoplasm. But these complex compounds are, nevertheless,  formed by the combinations of but a few of the elements now known to us.    Many writers on the subject of the habitability of other worlds, from  contemplating the rich and apparently limitless variety of the forms of  life, and the diversity of the conditions under which they exist, have  been led to assume that the basis of life must itself also in like manner  be infinitely broad and infinitely varied. In this they are mistaken. As  we have seen, the elements entering into the composition of organic bodies  are, in the main, few in number. The temperatures at which they can exist  are likewise strictly limited. But, above all, that circulation of matter  which we call Life--the metabolism of vital processes--requires for its  continuance the presence of one indispensable factor--WATER.    Protoplasm itself, as Czapek puts it, is practically an _albumin sol_;  that is to say, it is a chemical substance of which the chief constituents  are albuminous matter and water, and the protoplasm can only take from  without material dissolved in water; it can only eject matter in the same  way. This _osmosis_ is an indispensable condition in the vital process.  And the \"streaming\" of protoplasm, its continual movement in the cell, can  only be carried on in water.    WATER is the compound of oxygen and hydrogen in the proportion of two  atoms of hydrogen to one of oxygen. It is familiar to us in three states:  solid, liquid, and gaseous, or ice, water, and steam. But it is only in  the liquid state that water is available for carrying on the processes of  life. This fact limits the temperatures at which the organic functions can  be carried on, for water under terrestrial conditions is only liquid for a  hundred degrees; it freezes at 0 deg. Centigrade, it boils at 100 deg. Centigrade.  Necessarily, our experiences are mostly confined within this range, and  therefore we are apt unconsciously to assume that this range is all the  range that is possible, whereas it is but a very small fraction of the  range conceivable, and indeed existing, in cosmical space. In its liquid  state water is a general solvent, and yet pure water is neutral in its  qualities, both characteristics being essential to its usefulness as a  vehicle for the protoplasmic actions. Naturally, this function of water as  a solvent can only exist when water is in the liquid state; solid water,  that is ice, neither dissolves nor flows; and water, when heated to  boiling point, passes into vapour, and so leaves the organism  moistureless, and therefore dead. It is possible to grind a living  organism to a pulp so that the structure of the cells is practically  destroyed, and yet for some reactions which are quite peculiar to life  still to show themselves for some appreciable time. But when the cell-pulp  is heated to the temperature of boiling water, these chemical processes  cannot be longer observed. What is left may then be considered as  definitely dead.    Water is, then, indispensable for the living organism; but there are two  great divisions of such organisms--plants and animals. Animals are  generally, but not universally, free to move, and therefore to travel to  seek their food. But their food is restricted; they cannot directly  convert inorganic matter to their own use; they can only assimilate  organic material. The plant, on the other hand, unlike the animal, can  make use of inorganic material. Plant life, therefore, requires an  abundant supply of water in which the various substances necessary for its  support can be dissolved; it must either be in water, or, if on land,  there must be an active circulation of water both through the atmosphere  and through the soil, so as to bring to it the food that it requires.  Animal life presupposes plant life, for it is always dependent upon it.    Many writers have assumed that life is very widely distributed in  connection with this planet. The assumption is a mistaken one, as has been  well pointed out by Garrett P. Serviss, a charming writer on astronomical  subjects: \"On the Earth we find animated existence confined to the surface  of the crust of the globe, to the lower and denser strata of the  atmosphere, and to the film of water that constitutes the oceans. It does  not exist in the heart of the rocks forming the body of the planet nor in  the void of space surrounding it outside the atmosphere. As the Earth  condensed from the original nebula, and cooled and solidified, a certain  quantity of matter remained at its surface in the form of free gases and  unstable compounds, and, within the narrow precincts where these things  were, lying like a thin shell between the huge inert globe of permanently  combined elements below, and the equally unchanging realm of the ether  above, life, a phenomenon depending upon ceaseless changes, combinations  and re-combinations of chemical elements in unstable and temporary union,  made its appearance, and there only we find it at the present time.\"[6]    \"The huge inert globe of permanently combined elements below, and the  equally unchanging realm of the ether above,\" offer no home for the living  organism; least of all for the highest of such organisms--Man. Both must  be tempered to a condition which will permit and favour continual change,  the metabolism which is the essential feature of life.    \"When the earth had to be prepared for the habitation of man, a veil, as  it were, of intermediate being was spread between him and its darkness, in  which were joined, in a subdued measure, the stability and the  insensibility of the earth, and the passion and perishing of mankind.    \"But the heavens, also, had to be prepared for his habitation. Between  their burning light,--their deep vacuity, and man, as between the earth's  gloom of iron substance, and man, a veil had to be spread of intermediate  being;--which should appease the unendurable glory to the level of human  feebleness, and sign the changeless motion of the heavens with the  semblance of human vicissitude. Between the earth and man arose the leaf.  Between the heaven and man came the cloud. His life being partly as the  falling leaf and partly as the flying vapour.\"[7]    The leaf and the cloud are the signs of a habitable world. The leaf--that  is to say, plant life, vegetation--is necessary because animal life is not  capable of building itself up from inorganic material. This step must have  been previously taken by the plant. The cloud, that is to say  water-vapour, is necessary because the plant in its turn cannot directly  assimilate to itself the nitrogen from the atmosphere. The food for the  plant is brought to it by water, and it assimilates it by the help of  water. It is, therefore, upon the question of the presence of water that  the question of the habitability of a given world chiefly turns. In the  physical sense, man is \"born of water,\" and any world fitted for his  habitation must \"stand out of the water and in the water.\"          CHAPTER III    THE SUN      The Sun is, of all the heavenly bodies, the most impressive, and has  necessarily, at all times, attracted the chief attention of men. There are  only two of the heavenly bodies that appear to be more than points of  light, only two that show a surface to the naked eye, and the Sun, being  so much the brighter of the two, and the obvious source of all our light  and heat, and the fosterer of vegetation, readily takes the premier place  in interest. In the present day we know too much about the Sun for anyone  to suppose that it can be the home of organic life; but it is not many  years since its habitability was seriously suggested even by so high an  authority as Sir William Herschel. He conceived that it was possible that  its stores of light and heat might be confined to a relatively thin shell  in its upper atmosphere, and that below this shell a screen of clouds  might so check radiation downward that it would be possible for an inner  nucleus to exist which should be cool and solid. This fancied inner globe  would then necessarily enjoy perpetual daylight, and a climate which knew  no variation from pole to pole. To its inhabitants the entire heavens  would be generally luminous, the light not being concentrated into any one  part of the vault; and it was supposed that, ignorant of time, a happy  race might flourish, cultivating the far-spread solar fields, in perpetual  daylight, and in the serenity of a perpetual spring that was distracted by  no storm.    The picture thus conjured up is a pleasing one, though probably, to the  restless sons of Earth, it would seem to suffer somewhat from monotony.  But we now know that it corresponds in not a single detail to the actual  facts. The study of solar conditions carried on through the last hundred  years has revealed to us, not serenity and peace, but storm, stress, and  commotion on the most gigantic scale. But though we now can dismiss from  our minds the possibility that the Sun can be inhabited, yet it is of such  importance to the maintenance of life on this planet, and by parity of  reasoning to life on any other planet, that a review of its conditions  forms a necessary introduction to our subject. Further, those conditions  themselves will bring out certain principles that are of necessary  application when we come to consider the case of particular planets.    The distance of the Sun from the Earth is often spoken of as the  \"astronomical unit\"; it is the fundamental measure of astronomy, and all  our information as to the sizes and distances of the various planets rests  upon it. And, as we shall shortly see, the particular problem with which  we are engaged--the habitability of worlds--is directly connected with  these two factors:"]]]
