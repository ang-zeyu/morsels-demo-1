Certain species have been tested by a number of people and found to be  perfectly safe and savory; on the other hand, there are species under  various genera which, if not actually poisonous, are at least  deleterious.    It is the province of all books on fungi to assist the student in  separating the plants into genera and species; in this work special  attention has been given to distinguishing between the edible and the  poisonous species. There are a few species such as Gyromitra esculenta,  Lepiota Morgani, Clitocybe illudens, etc., which when eaten by certain  persons will cause sickness soon after eating, while others will escape  any disagreeable effects. Chemically speaking, they are not poisonous,  but simply refuse to be assimilated in some stomachs. It is best to  avoid all such.      =HOW MUSHROOMS GROW.= There is a strong notion that mushrooms grow very  quickly, springing up in a single night. This is erroneous. It is true  that after they have reached the button stage they develop very quickly;  or in the case of those that spring from a mature egg, develop so  rapidly that you can plainly see the motion of the upward growth, but  the development of the button from the mycelium or spawn takes  time--weeks, months, and even years. It would be very difficult to tell  the age of many of our tree fungi.      =HOW TO LEARN MUSHROOMS.= If the beginner will avoid all Amanitas and  perhaps some of the Boleti he need not be much worried in regard to the  safety of other species.    There are three ways by which he can become familiar with the edible  kinds. The first is the physiological test suggested by Mr. Gibson in  his book. It consists in chewing a small morsel and then spitting it out  without swallowing the juice; if no important symptoms arise within  twenty-four hours, another bit may be chewed, this time swallowing a  small portion of the juice. Should no irritation be experienced after  another period of waiting, a still larger piece may be tried. I always  sample a new plant carefully, and thus am often able to establish the  fact of its edibility before being able to locate it in its proper  species. This fall I found for the first time Tricholoma columbetta; it  was some time after I had proven it an edible mushroom before I had  settled upon its name. A better way, perhaps, is to cook them and feed  them to your cat and watch the result.    Another way is to have a friend who knows the plants go with you, and  thus you learn under a teacher as a pupil learns in school. This is the  quickest way to gain a knowledge of plants of any kind, but it is  difficult to find a competent teacher.    Still another way, and one that is open to all, is to gain a knowledge  of a few species and through their description become familiar with the  terms used in describing a mushroom; this done, the way is open, if you  have a book containing illustrations and descriptions of the most common  plants. Do not be in a hurry to get the names of all the plants, and do  not make use of any about which you are not absolutely sure. In  gathering mushrooms to eat, do not put into your basket with those you  intend to eat a single mushroom of whose edible qualities you have any  doubt. If you have the least doubt about it, discard it, or put it in  another basket.    There are no fixed rules by which you can tell a poisonous from an  edible mushroom. I found a friend of mine eating Lepiota naucina, not  even knowing to what genus it belonged, simply because she could peel  it. I told her that the most deadly mushroom can be peeled just as  readily. Nor is there anything more valuable in the silver spoon test in  which Mr. Gibson's old lady put so much confidence. Some say, do not eat  any that have an acrid taste; many are edible whose taste is quite  acrid. Others say, do not eat any whose juice or milk is white, but this  would discard a number of Lactarii that are quite good. There is nothing  in the white gills and hollow stem theory. It is true that the Amanita  has both, but it must be known by other characteristics. Again we are  told to avoid such as have a viscid cap, or those that change color  quickly; this is too sweeping a condemnation for it would cut out  several very good species. I think I may safely say there is no known  rule by which the good can be distinguished from the bad. The only safe  way is to know each species by its own individual peculiarities--to know  them as we know our friends.    The student of mycology has before him a description of each species,  which must tally with the plant in hand and which will soon render him  familiar with the different features of the various genera and species,  so he can recognize them as readily as the features of his best friends.      =WHAT ANYONE MAY EAT.= In the spring of the year there comes with the  earliest flowers a mushroom so strongly characteristic in all its forms  that no one will fail to recognize it. It is the common morel or sponge  mushroom. None of them are known to be harmful, hence here the beginner  can safely trust his judgment. While he is gathering morels to eat he  will soon begin to distinguish the different species of the genera. From  May till frost the different kinds of puff-balls will appear. All  puff-balls are good while their interior remains white. They are never  poisonous, but when the flesh has begun to turn yellow it is very  bitter. The oyster mushroom is found from March to December and is  always a very acceptable mushroom. The Fairy Rings are easily recognized  and can be found in any old pasture during wet weather from June to  October. In seasonable weather they are usually very plentiful. The  common meadow mushroom is found from September to frost. It is known by  its pink gills and meaty cap. There is a mushroom with pink gills found  in streets, along the pavements and among the cobble stones. The stems  are short and the caps are very meaty. It is A. rodmani. These are found  in May and June. The horse mushroom has pink gills and may be found  from June to September. The Russulas, found from July to October, are  generally good. A few should be avoided because of their acrid taste or  their strong odor. There is no time from early spring till freezing  weather when you can not find mushrooms, if the weather is at all  favorable. I have given the habitat and the time when each species can  be found. I should recommend a careful study of these two points. Read  the descriptions of plants which grow in certain places and at certain  times, and you will generally be rewarded, if you follow out the  description and the season is favorable.      =HOW TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.= Many can be dried for winter use, such as  the Morels, Marasmius oreades, Boletus edulis, Boletus edulis, va.  clavipes, and a number of others. My wife has very successfully canned a  number of species, notably Lycoperdon pyriforme, Pleurotus ostreatus and  Tricholoma personatum. The mushrooms were carefully picked over and  washed, let stand in salt water for about five minutes, in order to free  them of any insect-life which may be in the gills, then drained, cut  into pieces small enough to go into the jars easily. Each jar was packed  as full as possible with mushrooms and filled up with water salt enough  to flavor the mushroom properly. Then put into a kettle of cold water on  the stove, the lids being loosely placed on the top, and allowed to cook  for an hour or more after the water in the kettle begins to boil. The  tops were then fastened on securely and after trying the jars to see if  there was any leak, they were set away in a cool, dark place.    In canning puff-balls they should be carefully washed and sliced, being  sure that they are perfectly white all through. They do not need to  stand in salt water before packing in the jar as do those mushrooms  which have gills. Otherwise they were canned as the Tricholoma and  oyster mushroom. Any edible mushroom can easily be kept for winter use  by canning. Use glass jars with glass tops.      TERMS USED    =SOME OF THE MOST COMMON TERMS USED.= In describing mushrooms it is  necessary to use certain terms, and it will be incumbent upon anyone who  wishes to become familiar with this part of botanical work to understand  thoroughly the terms used in describing the plants.    The substance of all mushrooms is either fleshy, membranaceous, or  corky. The _pileus_ or _cap_ is the expanded part, which may be either  sessile or supported by a stem. The pileus is not made up of cellular  tissue as in flowering plants, but of myriads of interwoven threads or  hyphae. This structure of the pileus will become evident at once if a  thin portion of the cap is placed under the microscope.    The _gills_ or _lamellae_ are thin plates or membranes radiating from the  stem to the margin of the cap. When they are attached squarely and  firmly to the stem they are said to be _adnate_. If they are attached  only by a part of the width of the gills, they are _adnexed_. Should  they extend down on the stem, they are _decurrent_. They are _free_ when  they are not attached to the stem. Frequently the lower edge is notched  at, or near, the stem and in this case they are said to be _emarginate_  or _sinuate_.    [Illustration: Figure 2.--Small portion of a section through the  spore-bearing layer of a mushroom which produces its spores on the ends  of cells called basidium. (a) Spores, (b) basidium, (c) sterile cells.]    In some genera the lower surface of the cap is full of pores instead of  gills; in other genera the lower surface is crowded with teeth; in still  others the surface is smooth, as in the Stereums. The gills, pores and  teeth afford a foundation for the hymenium or fruit-bearing surface. It  will be readily seen that the gills, pores and teeth simply expose in a  very economical way the greatest possible spore-bearing surface.    If a section of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29122"],[0,"Mammals Obtained (#3)"],[1,"breadth that is approximately same in the  two subspecies; tympanic bullae notably smaller. From _Lepus  californicus altamirae_ Nelson, _L. c. curti_ differs in having the  black patch on the nape less definitely divided by a median,  longitudinal band of buffy color, and lesser size. Exception is to be  made for the ear and tympanic bullae, which are of approximately the  same size in the two subspecies.    _Remarks._--The subspecific part of the name _Lepus californicus curti_  is proposed in honor of Dr. Curt von Wedel who shared the pleasure of  collecting on the islands where this handsome hare lives.    The specimens of _L. c. curti_ are all females, which, in the genus  _Lepus_, average larger than the males. Comparison of the measurements  recorded below with those in the account by Nelson (N. Amer. Fauna,  29:129, 1909) may not reveal the full measure of difference in size  between _L. c. curti_ and other subspecies because Nelson (_op. cit._)  pooled males and females in obtaining the average measurements that he  records. For example, he used three males and two females of _Lepus  altamirae_ in obtaining an average (_op. cit._:117). The specimens of  _L. c. curti_ here recorded are thought to be of full size inasmuch as  the degree of fusion of bones in the skull, and the density of the  cranial bones indicate full adulthood for each specimen.  Reproductive-wise, there is no question as to adulthood; each of the  four females was pregnant. One specimen had two embryos (each 30  millimeters long in crown-rump measurement) and each of the other  specimens contained one embryo. These three embryos were 55, 60, and 105  mm. long.    Three of our specimens, including the holotype, were obtained north of  the eighth pass and the other specimen, No. 35473, was obtained a few  hundred yards south of the pass. Because the part of the barrier beach  south of the pass was connected to the mainland, it is likely that the  newly named subspecies occurs also on the adjacent mainland; however, we  have examined no specimens of _Lepus californicus_ from the opposite  mainland except from Matamoros, ninety miles to the north, and from  Altamira, approximately one hundred and fifty miles south of our  collecting locality. A specimen from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and several  from Brownsville, Texas, in size of auditory bullae, larger overall size  and darker color clearly are _L. c. merriami_ and not _L. c. curti_.    The small tympanic bullae of the specimens from Padre Island were  commented upon by Nelson (_op. cit._:149) who found smallness of bullae  to characterize many of the specimens from the eastern part of the  geographic range of _L. c. merriami_. In the northeastern part of the  geographic range of _L. c. merriami_, as Nelson pointed out, the small  size of the tympanic bullae was one of several evidences of  intergradation there with _Lepus californicus melanotis_, the subspecies  next adjacent to the north. In the light of present information, it  seems that the smallness of the tympanic bullae in the specimens (3)  from Padre Island may be an independent development--an adaptation to  environmental conditions that reaches its fullest development on the  same chain of islands eighty-odd miles southward of Matamoros. The  specimens from Padre Island, although possessing small bullae, in other  features, for example, larger size of other parts, are _merriami_.    The four specimens of _L. c. curti_ are in worn winter pelage and the  new pelage is coming in on the thighs. Most of the specimens (6) of the  _L. c. altamirae_ are in the same condition of pelage. In color and  color pattern, the two subspecies are, to me, indistinguishable except  that the black patch on the nape is less widely and less definitely  separated into two parts by a median, longitudinal, band of buffy color.    _Lepus californicus altamirae_ was named by Nelson (Proc. Biol. Soc.  Washington, 17:109, May 18, 1904) as a black-tailed jack rabbit, _Lepus  merriami altamirae_, but was later transferred by Nelson (N. Amer.  Fauna, 29:124, 1909) to the white-sided section of the genus and  arranged as a full species, _Lepus altamirae_. In making this transfer,  Nelson (_op. cit._:125) wrote that in \"This well marked species ... the  lack of a black patch on the posterior half of the ear at the tip and  the white flanks (somewhat obscured in some of the original specimens)  are strong characters which place it in the _callotis_ group.\"  \"Posterior half of ears white without any trace of black at tip\", was  the way Nelson (_op. cit._:124) described the ears in _L. altamirae_. My  examination of the original series including the type, reveals that the  ears do have some black at the tip of the posterior half in three of the  specimens, some brown in one other specimen, and only a dusky tinge in  two others. In the four specimens of _L. c. curti_ the tip of the ear is  faintly brownish in one animal and dusky in three. The extent of the  white flanks seems to be identical in the two series. Fortunately they  are in the same pelage and same stage of molt on the hind legs. The one  difference that I can detect is in the coloration of the nape. In each  of the specimens of _L. altamirae_ the coloration is as described by  Nelson (_op. cit._:124): \"nape with two lateral black bands extending  back from base of ears, and separated by a median band of buffy.\" In _L.  c. curti_ the nape is all black in one specimen and the median band of  buffy is present in the other three but is narrower and more dusky than  in _L. altamirae_. Since the characters (color of tip of ear and extent  of white on the flank) relied upon by Nelson for placing _L. altamirae_  in the _callotis_ group are duplicated in the _californicus_ group, in  _L. c. curti_, there is reason for questioning whether _altamirae_ is  correctly placed, taxonomically, in the _L. callotis_ group.    Cursory examination of skulls of the _callotis_ group and the  _californicus_ group indicates that the prepalatal spine (the part of  the palate which extends anteriorly toward the vomer) is longer in _L.  californicus_ than in _L. callotis_, _L. gaillardi_ and _L. alleni_. In  this feature, _L. altamirae_ agrees with _Lepus californicus_ and  differs from members of the _Lepus callotis_ group. Furthermore, the  newly named _L. c. curti_, in color of ear and color of nape, is  intermediate between _L. altamirae_ and _L. c. merriami_. Consequently,  _Lepus merriami altamirae_ Nelson, it seems, should stand as _Lepus  californicus altamirae_.    Mention should be made here of the view of Shamel (Proc. Biol. Soc.  Washington, 55:25-26, May 12, 1942) that the _californicus_ group should  be divided into two groups (each group possibly amounting to something  more than a species and something less than a subgenus) on the basis of  a white rump and complex infolding of the enamel layer of the front of  the first upper incisor _versus_ a dark rump and simple infolding of the  mentioned layer of enamel. He placed _Lepus californicus merriami_  Mearns, among other subspecies, in a group different from the one in  which he placed several other subspecies of _Lepus californicus_.    Specimens (skulls with accompanying skins) of the species _Lepus  californicus_ in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States  National Museum, representative of a gradual transition from the dark  rump and simple fold in the enamel to the white rump and complex fold in  the enamel are as follows: _L. c. deserticola_, No. 29733/41808,  Paharanagat Valley, Nevada; Nos. 117463 and 156744, Beals Spring,  Arizona. _L. c. texianus_, No. 24635/32031, Springerville, Arizona; No.  97453, Roswell, New Mexico; No. 118751, Toyah, Texas; No. 118749,  Valentine, Texas; and No. 108700, Terlingua Creek, Texas. In the  continuously distributed species _Lepus californicus_, along the  northwest to southeast line provided by the localities of occurrence  listed immediately above, there is a gradual transition from one kind of  fold to the other kind and from one color of rump to the other color.  It is clear that Shamel (_op. cit._) was in error in his conclusions;  the kinds of black-tailed jack rabbits to which Shamel (_op. cit._)  applied the name _Macrotolagus_ should stand as given below.
