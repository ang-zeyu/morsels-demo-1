Then Mr. 'Coon and Jack Rabbit commenced to quarrel  about whose fish it was, and Mr. 'Possum said he didn't care whose it  was, he was getting a free ride, and he laid back and laughed and looked  at the shore, when all of a sudden he happened to spy there, sitting on  the end of a log, fishing and waiting for them, nobody but Mr. Dog  himself.    That wasn't very much, of course, but it was plenty for Mr. 'Possum. He  quit laughing and tumbled down in the bottom of the boat and laid there  calling for Jack Rabbit to cut that fish line or they'd all be chops and  steaks and carried home in a basket in less than five minutes. Jack  Rabbit did try to cut the line, too, but he was so excited he dropped  his knife overboard, and Mr. 'Coon couldn't find his, and Mr. 'Possum  didn't have any. So there they were, and there was Mr. Dog! Then Mr.  Rabbit tried to bite the line off with his teeth, but he couldn't do  that, either, for it was a big, strong line that he'd made himself,  specially for large fish.    And all the time they were getting closer and closer to the shore, and  Mr. Dog had lifted his line out of the water so it wouldn't be in his  way, and was sitting there waiting, and smiling to see them come.    Then Jack Rabbit knew that something had to be done, and there was no  time to lose. He was just about as scared as he could be, but he knew it  wouldn't do any good to let on, so he sat up straight and smiled some,  too, and looked at Mr. Dog and called out, big and friendly like:--    \"Hello, Mr. Dog! Here we come! Here we come with a nice dinner, Mr.  Dog!\"    Then Mr. Dog laughed and called back:--    \"That's right, Mr. Rabbit. There's a sure enough nice dinner coming this  time! Fish for the first course, Mr. Rabbit!\"    When Mr. 'Possum heard that he began to groan, and Jack Rabbit and Mr.  'Coon began to shiver, for each thought he knew pretty well what the  next courses of Mr. Dog's dinner would be. But Mr. Rabbit didn't stop  smiling or let on that he knew, and he called out again to Mr. Dog,  quick:--    \"You'll have to help us if we have fish, Mr. Dog! He's a big one and  you'll have to help us catch him!\"    And Mr. Dog called back again:--    \"Don't worry, Mr. Rabbit! I won't leave! I'll be on hand when you get  here, Mr. Rabbit!\"    Then he rolled up his trousers a little and waded out into the shallow  water, thinking he would nab Mr. Fish first and drag him out on shore,  and then pull the boat right in after him.    Of course, that was a pretty good plan for Mr. Dog, only like some other  good plans, it didn't work just as he expected it to. You see, he didn't  quite know how big the fish was, nor how hard a big fish is to handle in  shallow water. He made a quick grab at it when it got to him and then,  right away, he had his hands full of business. That fish gave a flop  with his tail that laid Mr. Dog over on his back and then another flop  that set him on his feet again, and a side flop that smacked him against  the water first one way and then the other, and made him breathe hard  and choke and try to let go.    But Mr. Dog couldn't let go, for he'd got the fish line some way tangled  in his teeth. So he began to snap and paw and swallow water, and fall  down and get up again, and sprawl about in the swamp grass, trying to  get back to shore.    [Illustration: THE FIGHT BETWEEN MR. DOG AND THE BIG FISH]    And while all this was going on Jack Rabbit and his friends had jumped  out into the shallow water and took a little roundin's to shore, keeping  out of Mr. Dog's way, and made tracks for the top of a hill, where they  would be out of danger and see the fun at the same time. Then they all  stood up there and watched the fight between Mr. Dog and the big fish,  and Jack Rabbit sang out, as loud as ever he could:--    \"Don't leave, Mr. Dog! Stay with him, Mr. Dog! Hold him to it, Mr. Dog;  you've got him! First course, Mr. Dog!\"    And Mr. Dog heard Jack Rabbit and got madder and madder every minute,  till all of a sudden he got a lick on the side of the head from Mr.  Fish's tail that made him see stars and broke the line. And away went  the big fish out into deep water, while Mr. Dog crawled back to shore,  wet and bruised from head to foot, and 'most dead.    Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum and Jack Rabbit, standing on top of the  hill, gave a great big laugh, all together, and Mr. Rabbit called  out:--    \"How did you like the first course, Mr. Dog?\"    That made them all laugh again, and then Mr. 'Coon called out:--    \"Are you ready for the second course, Mr. Dog?\"    And pretty soon Mr. 'Possum he called out:--    \"Are you ready for a nice roast now, Mr. Dog?\"    And that, of course, made them all laugh very loud, for Mr. 'Possum used  slang now and then and meant by a \"roast\" that people would all make fun  of Mr. Dog wherever he went; which they did, for a long time.    Even Mr. Robin, who was good friends with Mr. Dog, couldn't help calling  out to him, now and then, as he went by:--    \"Are you ready for the next course, Mr. Dog?\"    And Mr. Dog would pretend not to hear and go hurrying by very fast, as  if he were out on special and important business for Mr. Man.    [Illustration: LEANING OVER TO LIGHT HIS PIPE FROM MR. 'POSSUM'S]          MR. RABBIT EXPLAINS    AN EASTER STORY      \"WHY do we always have rabbits at Easter?\" asked the Little Lady. \"Is  that a story, too?\"    The Story Teller lit his pipe, thinking all the time, and pretty soon he  said: \"Why, yes, there is a story about that, and it goes this way\":--    One afternoon in the early spring Mr. Jack Rabbit and his friends were  out for an airing. The Hollow Tree people were along, and Mr. Turtle, as  usual. By and by they came to a log under a big tree and sat down for a  smoke and talk. They talked about the weather at first and other things,  till somebody mentioned Easter. Then they all had something to say  about that.    \"What I object to,\" says Mr. Rabbit, when it came his time to talk, \"is  this thing of people always saying that the Easter eggs belong to me.\"    \"Oh, but that's just a joke,\" says Mr. 'Coon, laughing.    \"I know it's just a joke, of course, but it's a pretty old joke, and I'm  tired of it,\" says Jack Rabbit.    \"How did it get started anyway?\" asked Mr. 'Possum.    Then Mr. Rabbit took his pipe out of his mouth and leaned forward a  little, so he could talk better.    \"I tell you how it got started,\" he says, \"and after that I don't want  to hear any more of it. This is how it happened:--    [Illustration: THEY CAME TO A LOG UNDER A BIG TREE AND SAT DOWN FOR A  SMOKE AND TALK]    \"Once upon a time, as much as twenty grandmothers back, I should think,  there was a very nice family of Rabbits that lived in a grassy place on  a hillside back of a big farmyard. There was quite a hole in the  ground there, and they had a cozy home in it, and a soft bed for their  little folk.    \"Now, every bright morning, Father and Mother Rabbit used to take the  children out for a walk, and for a few lessons in running and hiding  from Mr. Dog, who bothered about a good deal, and one day as they were  coming home they heard a great cackling, and when they got to their  house there was a nice fresh egg lying right in the children's bed. Some  old hen from the farmyard had slipped in and laid it while they were  gone. A good many hens, especially old hens, like to hide their nests  that way, and this was one of that kind.    \"Well, of course all the young Rabbits claimed it, and Mother Rabbit at  last gave it to the smallest and weakest one of the children, a little  girl, who was always painting things with the juice of flower petals.  And the very first thing that little girl did was to stain that egg all  over with violet juice, not thinking what trouble it was going to cause  our family forever after.    [Illustration: THEY HAD A COZY HOME AND A SOFT BED FOR THEIR LITTLE  FOLK]    \"It was a nice blue egg when she got through with it, and the next day,  when they all came back from their walk again there was another white  egg right by it. The old hen had been there again and laid another while  they were gone. The second little girl claimed that egg, of course, and  she painted it a bright yellow with buttercup juice. Then the next day  there was another egg, and the next day there was another egg, and the  next day there was another egg, until there was one apiece for every one  of the children, and some over.    \"And they all painted them. Some painted theirs pink or red with rose  leaves or japonica, some painted them yellow with buttercups, and some  blue or purple with violets, as the first little girl had done. They had  so many at last that it crowded them out of their bed and they had to  sleep on the floor.    [Illustration: A FEW LESSONS IN RUNNING AND HIDING]    \"And then, one Sunday, and it must have been Easter Sunday, they all  went out walking again, and when they came back every one of those  beautiful colored eggs was gone. The children cried and made a great  fuss, but it was no use. Some of Mr. Man's boys out hunting hens' nests  had found them and taken them all home with them.    \"And of course all those colored eggs set Mr. Man to wondering, and he  came with his boys to the place where they had found them; and when they  looked in out jumped the whole Rabbit family, helter skelter in every  direction.    \"And right then,\" said Mr. Rabbit, leaning over to light his pipe from  Mr. 'Possum's, \"right then Mr. Man declared those colored eggs were  rabbit eggs, and he's kept on saying so ever since, though he knows  better, and he knows I don't like it. He takes eggs and colors them  himself now, and makes believe they're mine, and he puts my picture all  over things about Easter time. I suppose he thinks I don't care, but I  do, and I wish that little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37472"],[0,"Zanzibar Tales: Told (#3)"],[1,"know.\" For the hare had said to his wife, \"Let us remove  from this house.\" Therefore the folks in that neighborhood had no  knowledge of his whereabouts. Simba, however, went along, continuing  his inquiries, until presently one answered, \"That is his house on  the top of the mountain.\"    Without loss of time the lion climbed the mountain, and soon arrived at  the place indicated, only to find that there was no one at home. This,  however, did not trouble him; on the contrary, saying to himself, \"I'll  hide myself inside, and when Soongoora and his wife come home I'll eat  them both,\" he entered the house and lay down, awaiting their arrival.    Pretty soon along came the hare with his wife, not thinking of any  danger; but he very soon discovered the marks of the lion's paws  on the steep path. Stopping at once, he said to Mrs. Soongoora:  \"You go back, my dear. Simba, the lion, has passed this way, and I  think he must be looking for me.\"    But she replied, \"I will not go back; I will follow you, my husband.\"    Although greatly pleased at this proof of his wife's affection,  Soongoora said firmly: \"No, no; you have friends to go to. Go back.\"    So he persuaded her, and she went back; but he kept on, following the  footmarks, and saw--as he had suspected--that they went into his house.    \"Ah!\" said he to himself, \"Mr. Lion is inside, is he?\" Then,  cautiously going back a little way, he called out: \"How d'ye do,  house? How d'ye do?\" Waiting a moment, he remarked loudly: \"Well,  this is very strange! Every day, as I pass this place, I say, 'How  d'ye do, house?' and the house always answers, 'How d'ye do?' There  must be some one inside to-day.\"    When the lion heard this he called out, \"How d'ye do?\"    Then Soongoora burst out laughing, and shouted: \"Oho, Mr. Simba! You're  inside, and I'll bet you want to eat me; but first tell me where you  ever heard of a house talking!\"    Upon this the lion, seeing how he had been fooled, replied angrily,  \"You wait until I get hold of you; that's all.\"    \"Oh, I think you'll have to do the waiting,\" cried the hare; and then  he ran away, the lion following.    But it was of no use. Soongoora completely tired out old Simba, who,  saying, \"That rascal has beaten me; I don't want to have anything more  to do with him,\" returned to his home under the great calabash tree.                III.    THE LION, THE HYENA, AND THE RABBIT.      Once upon a time Sim'ba, the lion, Fee'see, the hyena, and Keetee'tee,  the rabbit, made up their minds to go in for a little farming. So  they went into the country, made a garden, planted all kinds of seeds,  and then came home and rested quite a while.    Then, when the time came when their crops should be about ripe and  ready for harvesting, they began to say to each other, \"Let's go over  to the farm, and see how our crops are coming along.\"    So one morning, early, they started, and, as the garden was a long way  off, Keeteetee, the rabbit, made this proposition: \"While we are going  to the farm, let us not stop on the road; and if any one does stop,  let him be eaten.\" His companions, not being so cunning as he, and  knowing they could outwalk him, readily consented to this arrangement.    Well, off they went; but they had not gone very far when the rabbit  stopped.    \"Hullo!\" said Feesee, the hyena; \"Keeteetee has stopped. He must  be eaten.\"    \"That's the bargain,\" agreed Simba, the lion.    \"Well,\" said the rabbit, \"I happened to be thinking.\"    \"What about?\" cried his partners, with great curiosity.    \"I'm thinking,\" said he, with a grave, philosophical air, \"about those  two stones, one big and one little; the little one does not go up,  nor does the big one go down.\"    The lion and the hyena, having stopped to look at the stones, could  only say, \"Why, really, it's singular; but it's just as you say;\"  and they all resumed their journey, the rabbit being by this time  well rested.    When they had gone some distance the rabbit stopped again.    \"Aha!\" said Feesee; \"Keeteetee has stopped again. Now he must be  eaten.\"    \"I rather think so,\" assented Simba.    \"Well,\" said the rabbit, \"I was thinking again.\"    Their curiosity once more aroused, his comrades begged him to tell  them his think.    \"Why,\" said he, \"I was thinking this: When people like us put on new  coats, where do the old ones go to?\"    Both Simba and Feesee, having stopped a moment to consider the matter,  exclaimed together, \"Well, I wonder!\" and the three went on, the  rabbit having again had a good rest.    After a little while the hyena, thinking it about time to show off  a little of his philosophy, suddenly stopped.    \"Here,\" growled Simba, \"this won't do; I guess we'll have to eat  you, Feesee.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said the hyena; \"I'm thinking.\"    \"What are you thinking about?\" they inquired.    \"I'm thinking about nothing at all,\" said he, imagining himself very  smart and witty.    \"Ah, pshaw!\" cried Keeteetee; \"we won't be fooled that way.\"    So he and Simba ate the hyena.    When they had finished eating their friend, the lion and the rabbit  proceeded on their way, and presently came to a place where there  was a cave, and here the rabbit stopped.    \"H'm!\" ejaculated Simba; \"I'm not so hungry as I was this morning,  but I guess I'll have to find room for you, little Keeteetee.\"    \"Oh, I believe not,\" replied Keeteetee; \"I'm thinking again.\"    \"Well,\" said the lion, \"what is it this time?\"    Said the rabbit: \"I'm thinking about that cave. In olden times our  ancestors used to go in here, and go out there, and I think I'll try  and follow in their footsteps.\"    So he went in at one end and out at the other end several times.    Then he said to the lion, \"Simba, old fellow, let's see you try to  do that;\" and the lion went into the cave, but he stuck fast, and  could neither go forward nor back out.    In a moment Keeteetee was on Simba's back, and began eating him.    After a little time the lion cried, \"Oh, brother, be impartial;  come and eat some of the front part of me.\"    But the rabbit replied, \"Indeed, I can't come around in front; I'm  ashamed to look you in the face.\"    So, having eaten all he was able to, he left the lion there, and went  and became sole owner of the farm and its crops.                IV.    THE KITES AND THE CROWS.      One day Koongoo'roo, sultan of the crows, sent a letter to Mway'way,  sultan of the kites, containing these few words: \"I want you folks  to be my soldiers.\"    To this brief message Mwayway at once wrote this short reply:  \"I should say not.\"    Thereupon, thinking to scare Mwayway, the sultan of the crows sent  him word, \"If you refuse to obey me I'll make war upon you.\"    To which the sultan of the kites replied, \"That suits me; let us fight,  and if you beat us we will obey you, but if we are victors you shall  be our servants.\"    So they gathered their forces and engaged in a great battle, and in a  little while it became evident that the crows were being badly beaten.    As it appeared certain that, if something were not done pretty  quickly, they would all be killed, one old crow, named Jeeoo'see,  suddenly proposed that they should fly away.    Directly the suggestion was made it was acted upon, and the crows left  their homes and flew far away, where they set up another town. So,  when the kites entered the place, they found no one there, and they  took up their residence in Crowtown.    One day, when the crows had gathered in council, Koongooroo stood up  and said: \"My people, do as I command you, and all will be well. Pluck  out some of my feathers and throw me into the town of the kites;  then come back and stay here until you hear from me.\"    Without argument or questioning the crows obeyed their sultan's  command.    Koongooroo had lain in the street but a short time, when some passing  kites saw him and inquired threateningly, \"What are you doing here  in our town?\"    With many a moan he replied, \"My companions have beaten me and turned  me out of their town because I advised them to obey Mwayway, sultan  of the kites.\"    When they heard this they picked him up and took him before the sultan,  to whom they said, \"We found this fellow lying in the street, and  he attributes his involuntary presence in our town to so singular a  circumstance that we thought you should hear his story.\"    Koongooroo was then bidden to repeat his statement, which he did,  adding the remark that, much as he had suffered, he still held to  his opinion that Mwayway was his rightful sultan.    This, of course, made a very favorable impression, and the sultan said,  \"You have more sense than all the rest of your tribe put together;  I guess you can stay here and live with us.\"    So Koongooroo, expressing much gratitude, settled down, apparently,  to spend the remainder of his life with the kites.    One day his neighbors took him to church with them, and when they  returned home they asked him, \"Who have the best kind of religion,  the kites or the crows?\"    To which crafty old Koongooroo replied, with great enthusiasm, \"Oh,  the kites, by long odds!\"    This answer tickled the kites like anything, and Koongooroo was looked  upon as a bird of remarkable discernment.    When almost another week had passed, the sultan of the crows slipped  away in the night, went to his own town, and called his people  together.    \"To-morrow,\" said he, \"is the great annual religious festival of  the kites, and they will all go to church in the morning. Go, now,  and get some wood and some fire, and wait near their town until I  call you; then come quickly and set fire to the church.\"    Then he hurried back to Mwayway's town.    The crows were very busy indeed all that night, and by dawn they had  an abundance of wood and fire at hand, and were lying in wait near  the town of their victorious enemies.    So in the morning every kite went to church. There was not one person  left at home except old Koongooroo."]]]
