DISEASE, which consists in an unnatural condition of the bodily  organs, is in most cases under the control of fixed laws, which we are  capable of understanding and obeying. Nor do diseases come by chance;  they are penalties for violating physical laws. If we carelessly cut  or bruise our flesh, pain and soreness follow, to induce us to be more  careful in the future; or, if we take improper food into the stomach,  we are warned, perhaps immediately by a friendly pain, that we have  violated an organic law.    16. Sometimes, however, the penalty does not directly follow the sin,  and it requires great physiological knowledge to be able to trace the  effect to its true cause. If we possess good constitutions, we are  responsible for most of our sickness; and bad constitutions, or  hereditary diseases, are but the results of the same great law,--the  iniquities of the parents being visited on the children. In this view  of the subject, how important is the study of physiology and hygiene!  For how can we expect to obey laws which we do not understand?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    15. What is said of disease? 16. Why is the study of physiology and  hygiene important?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER II.    STRUCTURE OF MAN,      17. In the structure of the human body, there is a union of fluids and  solids. These are essentially the same, for the one is readily changed  into the other. There is no fluid that does not contain solid matter  in solution, and no solid matter that is destitute of fluid.    18. In different individuals, and at different periods of life the  proportion of fluids and solids varies. In youth, the fluids are more  abundant than in advanced life. For this reason, the limbs in  childhood are soft and round, while in old age they assume a hard and  wrinkled appearance.    19. The fluids not only contain the materials from which every part of  the body is formed, but they are the medium for conveying the waste,  decayed particles of matter from the system. They have various names,  according to their nature and function; as, the blood, and the bile.    20. The solids are formed from the fluids, and consequently they are  reduced, by chemical analysis, to the same ultimate elements. The  particles of matter in solids are arranged variously; sometimes in  _fi'bres_, (threads,) sometimes in _lam'i-nae_, (plates,) sometimes  homogeneously, as in basement membranes. (Appendix A.)    21. The parts of the body are arranged into _Fi'bres_, _Fas-cic'u-li_,  _Tis'sues_, _Or'gans_, _Ap-pa-ra'tus-es_, and _Sys'tems_.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    17. What substances enter into the structure of the human body? Are  they essentially the same? 18. What is said of these substances at  different periods of life? 19. What offices do the fluids of the  system perform? 20. What is said of the solids? How are the particles  of matter arranged in solids? 21. Give an arrangement of the parts of  the body.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    22. A FIBRE is a thread of exceeding fineness. It is either  cylindriform or flattened.    23. A FASCICULUS is the term applied to several fibres united. Its  general characteristics are the same as fibres.    24. A TISSUE is a term applied to several different solids of the  body.    25. An ORGAN is composed of tissues so arranged as to form an  instrument designed for action. The action of an organ is called its  _function_, or use.    _Example._ The liver is an organ, and the secretion of the bile from  the blood is one of its functions.[1]       [1] Where examples and observations are given or experiments         suggested, let the pupil mention other analogous ones.    26. An APPARATUS is an assemblage of organs designed to produce  certain results.    _Example._ The digestive apparatus consists of the teeth, stomach,  liver, &c., all of which aid in the digestion of food.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Represents a portion of broken muscular fibre of  animal life, (magnified about seven hundred diameters.)]    27. The term SYSTEM is applied to an assemblage of organs arranged  according to some plan, or method; as the nervous system, the  respiratory system.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    22.

Give an example  27. How is the term system applied?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    28. A TISSUE is a simple form of organized animal substance. It is  flexible, and formed of fibres interwoven in various ways; as, the  cellular tissue.    29. However various all organs may appear in their structure and  composition, it is now supposed that they can be reduced to a few  tissues; as, the _Cel'lu-lar_, _Os'se-ous_, _Mus'cu-lar_, _Mu'cous_,  _Ner'vous_, &c. (Appendix B.)    30. The CELLULAR TISSUE,[2] now called the _areolar tissue_, consists  of small fibres, or bands, interlaced in every direction, so as to  form a net-work, with numerous interstices that communicate freely  with each other. These interstices are filled, during life, with a  fluid resembling the serum of blood. The use of the areolar tissue is  to connect together organs and parts of organs, and to envelop, fix,  and protect the vessels and nerves of organs.       [2] The _Cellular_, _Serous_, _Dermoid_, _Fibrous_, and _Mucous         tissues_ are very generally called _membranes_.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Arrangement of fibres of the cellular tissue  magnified one hundred and thirty diameters.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    28. What is a tissue? 29. What is said respecting the structure and  composition of the various organs? Name the primary membranes. 30.  Describe the cellular tissue. How are the cells imbedded in certain  tissues? Give observation 1st, relative to the cellular tissue.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Observations._ 1st. When this fluid becomes too great in quantity, in  consequence of disease, the patient labors under general dropsy. The  swelling of the feet when standing, and their return to a proper shape  during the night, so often noticed in feeble persons, furnish a  striking proof both of the existence and peculiarity of this tissue,  which allows the fluid to flow from cell to cell, until it settles in  the lower extremities.    2d. The free communication between the cells is still more remarkable  in regard to air. Sometimes, when an accidental opening has been made  from the air-cells of the lungs into the contiguous cellular tissue,  the air in respiration has penetrated every part until the whole body  is so inflated as to occasion suffocation. Butchers often avail  themselves of the knowledge of this fact, and inflate their meat to  give it a fat appearance.    31. \"Although this tissue enters into the composition of all organs,  it never loses its own structure, nor participates in the functions of  the organ of which it forms a part. Though present in the nerves, it  does not share in their sensibility; and though it accompanies every  muscle and every muscular fibre, it does not partake of the  irritability which belongs to these organs.\"    32. Several varieties of tissue are formed from the cellular; as, the  _Se'rous_, _Der'moid_, _Fi'brous_, and several others.    33. The SEROUS TISSUE lines all the closed, or sac-like cavities of  the body; as, the chest, joints, and abdomen. It not only lines these  cavities, but is reflected, and invests the organs contained in them.  The liver and the lungs are thus invested. This membrane is of a  whitish color, and smooth on its free surfaces. These surfaces are  kept moist, and prevented from adhering by a _se'rous_ fluid, which is  separated from the blood. The use of this membrane is to separate  organs and also to facilitate the movement of one part upon another,  by means of its moist, polished surfaces.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Give observation 2d. 31. What is said of the identity of this tissue?  32. Name the varieties of tissue formed from the cellular. 33. Where  is the serous tissue found? What two offices does it perform? Give its  structure. What is the use of this membrane?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    34. The DERMOID TISSUE covers the outside of the body. It is called  the _cu'tis_, (skin.) This membrane is continuous with the mucous at  the various orifices of the body, and in these situations, from the  similarity of their structure, it is difficult to distinguish between  them.    _Observations._ 1st. In consequence of the continuity and similarity  of structure, there is close sympathy between the mucous and dermoid  membranes. If the functions of the skin are disturbed, as by a chill,  it will frequently cause a catarrh, (cold,) or diarrhoea. Again, in  consequence of this intimate sympathy, these complaints can be  relieved by exciting a free action in the vessels of the skin.    2d. It is no uncommon occurrence that diseased or irritated conditions  of the mucous membrane of the stomach or intestines produce diseases  or irritations of the skin, as is seen in the rashes attendant on  dyspepsia, and eating certain species of fish. These eruptions of the  skin can be relieved by removing the diseased condition of the  stomach.    35. The FIBROUS TISSUE consists of longitudinal, parallel fibres,  which are closely united. These fibres, in some situations, form a  thin, dense, strong membrane, like that which lines the internal  surface of the skull, or invests the external surface of the bones.  In other instances, they form strong, inelastic bands, called  _lig'a-ments_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3055"],[0,"The Wood Beyond the World (#3)"],[1," BARTHOLOMEW, AND SHE IS DRIVEN OFF HER  COURSE      Now swift sailed the Bartholomew for four weeks toward the north-west  with a fair wind, and all was well with ship and crew.  Then the wind  died out on even of a day, so that the ship scarce made way at all,  though she rolled in a great swell of the sea, so great, that it seemed  to ridge all the main athwart.  Moreover down in the west was a great  bank of cloud huddled up in haze, whereas for twenty days past the sky  had been clear, save for a few bright white clouds flying before the  wind.  Now the shipmaster, a man right cunning in his craft, looked long  on sea and sky, and then turned and bade the mariners take in sail and be  right heedful.  And when Walter asked him what he looked for, and  wherefore he spake not to him thereof, he said surlily: \"Why should I  tell thee what any fool can see without telling, to wit that there is  weather to hand?\"    So they abode what should befall, and Walter went to his room to sleep  away the uneasy while, for the night was now fallen; and he knew no more  till he was waked up by great hubbub and clamour of the shipmen, and the  whipping of ropes, and thunder of flapping sails, and the tossing and  weltering of the ship withal.  But, being a very stout-hearted young man,  he lay still in his room, partly because he was a landsman, and had no  mind to tumble about amongst the shipmen and hinder them; and withal he  said to himself: What matter whether I go down to the bottom of the sea,  or come back to Langton, since either way my life or my death will take  away from me the fulfilment of desire?  Yet soothly if there hath been a  shift of wind, that is not so ill; for then shall we be driven to other  lands, and so at the least our home-coming shall be delayed, and other  tidings may hap amidst of our tarrying.  So let all be as it will.    So in a little while, in spite of the ship's wallowing and the tumult of  the wind and waves, he fell asleep again, and woke no more till it was  full daylight, and there was the shipmaster standing in the door of his  room, the sea-water all streaming from his wet-weather raiment.  He said  to Walter: \"Young master, the sele of the day to thee!  For by good hap  we have gotten into another day.  Now I shall tell thee that we have  striven to beat, so as not to be driven off our course, but all would not  avail, wherefore for these three hours we have been running before the  wind; but, fair sir, so big hath been the sea that but for our ship being  of the stoutest, and our men all yare, we had all grown exceeding wise  concerning the ground of the mid-main.  Praise be to St. Nicholas and all  Hallows! for though ye shall presently look upon a new sea, and maybe a  new land to boot, yet is that better than looking on the ugly things down  below.\"    \"Is all well with ship and crew then?\" said Walter.    \"Yea forsooth,\" said the shipmaster; \"verily the Bartholomew is the  darling of Oak Woods; come up and look at it, how she is dealing with  wind and waves all free from fear.\"    So Walter did on his foul-weather raiment, and went up on to the quarter-  deck, and there indeed was a change of days; for the sea was dark and  tumbling mountain-high, and the white-horses were running down the  valleys thereof, and the clouds drave low over all, and bore a scud of  rain along with them; and though there was but a rag of sail on her, the  ship flew before the wind, rolling a great wash of water from bulwark to  bulwark.    Walter stood looking on it all awhile, holding on by a stay-rope, and  saying to himself that it was well that they were driving so fast toward  new things.    Then the shipmaster came up to him and clapped him on the shoulder and  said: \"Well, shipmate, cheer up! and now come below again and eat some  meat, and drink a cup with me.\"    So Walter went down and ate and drank, and his heart was lighter than it  had been since he had heard of his father's death, and the feud awaiting  him at home, which forsooth he had deemed would stay his wanderings a  weary while, and therewithal his hopes.  But now it seemed as if he needs  must wander, would he, would he not; and so it was that even this fed his  hope; so sore his heart clung to that desire of his to seek home to those  three that seemed to call him unto them.          CHAPTER V: NOW THEY COME TO A NEW LAND      Three days they drave before the wind, and on the fourth the clouds  lifted, the sun shone out and the offing was clear; the wind had much  abated, though it still blew a breeze, and was a head wind for sailing  toward the country of Langton.  So then the master said that, since they  were bewildered, and the wind so ill to deal with, it were best to go  still before the wind that they might make some land and get knowledge of  their whereabouts from the folk thereof.  Withal he said that he deemed  the land not to be very far distant.    So did they, and sailed on pleasantly enough, for the weather kept on  mending, and the wind fell till it was but a light breeze, yet still foul  for Langton.    So wore three days, and on the eve of the third, the man from the topmast  cried out that he saw land ahead; and so did they all before the sun was  quite set, though it were but a cloud no bigger than a man's hand.    When night fell they struck not sail, but went forth toward the land fair  and softly; for it was early summer, so that the nights were neither long  nor dark.    But when it was broad daylight, they opened a land, a long shore of rocks  and mountains, and nought else that they could see at first.  Nevertheless  as day wore and they drew nigher, first they saw how the mountains fell  away from the sea, and were behind a long wall of sheer cliff; and coming  nigher yet, they beheld a green plain going up after a little in green  bents and slopes to the feet of the said cliff-wall.    No city nor haven did they see there, not even when they were far nigher  to the land; nevertheless, whereas they hankered for the peace of the  green earth after all the tossing and unrest of the sea, and whereas also  they doubted not to find at the least good and fresh water, and belike  other bait in the plain under the mountains, they still sailed on not  unmerrily; so that by nightfall they cast anchor in five-fathom water  hard by the shore.    Next morning they found that they were lying a little way off the mouth  of a river not right great; so they put out their boats and towed the  ship up into the said river, and when they had gone up it for a mile or  thereabouts they found the sea water failed, for little was the ebb and  flow of the tide on that coast.  Then was the river deep and clear,  running between smooth grassy land like to meadows.  Also on their left  board they saw presently three head of neat cattle going, as if in a  meadow of a homestead in their own land, and a few sheep; and thereafter,  about a bow-draught from the river, they saw a little house of wood and  straw-thatch under a wooded mound, and with orchard trees about it.  They  wondered little thereat, for they knew no cause why that land should not  be builded, though it were in the far outlands.  However, they drew their  ship up to the bank, thinking that they would at least abide awhile and  ask tidings and have some refreshing of the green plain, which was so  lovely and pleasant.    But while they were busied herein they saw a man come out of the house,  and down to the river to meet them; and they soon saw that he was tall  and old, long-hoary of hair and beard, and clad mostly in the skins of  beasts.    He drew nigh without any fear or mistrust, and coming close to them gave  them the sele of the day in a kindly and pleasant voice.  The shipmaster  greeted him in his turn, and said withal: \"Old man, art thou the king of  this country?\"    The elder laughed; \"It hath had none other a long while,\" said he; \"and  at least there is no other son of Adam here to gainsay.\"    \"Thou art alone here then?\" said the master.    \"Yea,\" said the old man; \"save for the beasts of the field and the wood,  and the creeping things, and fowl.  Wherefore it is sweet to me to hear  your voices.\"    Said the master: \"Where be the other houses of the town?\"    The old man laughed.  Said he: \"When I said that I was alone, I meant  that I was alone in the land and not only alone in this stead.  There is  no house save this betwixt the sea and the dwellings of the Bears, over  the cliff-wall yonder, yea and a long way over it.\"    \"Yea,\" quoth the shipmaster grinning, \"and be the bears of thy country so  manlike, that they dwell in builded houses?\"    The old man shook his head.  \"Sir,\" said he, \"as to their bodily fashion,  it is altogether manlike, save that they be one and all higher and bigger  than most.  For they be bears only in name; they be a nation of half wild  men; for I have been told by them that there be many more than that tribe  whose folk I have seen, and that they spread wide about behind these  mountains from east to west.  Now, sir, as to their souls and  understandings I warrant them not; for miscreants they be, trowing  neither in God nor his hallows.\"    Said the master: \"Trow they in Mahound then?\"    \"Nay,\" said the elder, \"I wot not for sure that they have so much as a  false God; though I have it from them that they worship a certain woman  with mickle worship.\"    Then spake Walter: \"Yea, good sir, and how knowest thou that? dost thou  deal with them at all?\"    Said the old man: \"Whiles some of that folk come hither and have of me  what I can spare; a calf or two, or a half-dozen of lambs or hoggets; or  a skin of wine or cyder of mine own making: and they give me in return  such things as I can use, as skins of hart and bear and other peltries;  for now I am old, I can but little of the hunting hereabout.  Whiles,  also, they bring little lumps of pure copper, and would give me gold  also, but it is of little use"]]]
