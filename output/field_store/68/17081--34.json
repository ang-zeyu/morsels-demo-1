[Sidenote: _For school and home work_]    While a great deal of the work is intended for the schoolroom, many  suggestions are given for home weaving, in making various articles for  birthday and holiday gifts.          Chapter Two    A CHAT ON WEAVING      [Sidenote: _Weaving defined_]    [Sidenote: _Weaving trains both hands_]    [Sidenote: _The three-fold development_]    Weaving is the art of interlacing threads, yarns, filaments, or strips  of different material, so as to form a cloth or fabric. It is an ideal  occupation, not only for little children, but for older ones as well,  affording admirable opportunities for the development of head, hand, and  heart. It trains both hands in deftness and proves a delight to the  left-handed child, who for the joy of using his left hand again, will  plod patiently across with the right. The fat little hands soon learn to  grasp the large needle, and the nerves and muscles of both hand and arm  are strengthened by daily use. Both hand and eye are trained in  accuracy, and the training in patience, perseverance, industry, economy  in the use of materials, perception, concentration, dexterity, and  self-reliance cannot be overestimated. The heart, too, has its part in  the joy of giving to others, for the children are encouraged to make  little gifts for the home. A consciousness of power comes, also, with  experience; and a sense of self-respect arises when the child realizes  that he is of some use in the world.    [Sidenote: _Knowledge of principles necessary_]    Lois Bates, in her \"Kindergarten Guide,\" says that \"in the manufacturing  districts of England great numbers of the children who pass through the  elementary schools are employed in mills where weaving is carried on, or  enter textile schools to learn designing in cloth. If this occupation of  mat-weaving could be continued until the children had a thorough  knowledge of its principles, how much intelligence might be brought to  bear on the actual weaving and how much more pleasure might the worker  draw from labor that is often looked upon as so much mechanical  drudgery!\" The keynote for this is the _thorough knowledge_ which is  necessary, whether or not our children are to enter textile schools.  Whatever they do, let them do it thoroughly. It should always be a  question of quality, not quantity.    [Sidenote: _Simple weaving the first essential_]    [Sidenote: _Mats as a preparation for loom weaving_]    [Sidenote: _Slat interlacing and splint work lead to basketry_]    For this reason I have taken up, quite at length, the subject of first  steps in weaving, believing that children should be kept at simple  weaving until they understand the principles thoroughly. The felt and  paper mats prepare the way for loom-weaving; the free paper weaving, and  the slats and splints for basketry. A few suggestions on the use of the  slats and splints have been given for two reasons: First, for the  training which they afford in dexterity and great delicacy of touch, to  say nothing of _exemplary patience_; and second, because the preliminary  training for basketry should be given in the lower primary grades. The  time necessary to train clumsy fingers can hardly be taken from the  regular work in grades where basketry is a prescribed course.    \"Skill in the fundamental methods of weaving is essential even as the  fingers must be trained in music before the soul of the musician can  find its expression. Make good baskets first, simple in shape, strong in  texture, suited to the purpose for which they are intended;  unconsciously they will grow beautiful. The most intricate basket will  fail in its purpose if the joinings are careless or flaws in workmanship  permitted. If originality is within the weaver, it will find its  expression, once the principles of weaving are second nature.\" (_C. S.  Coles._) This is also true of rug and mat weaving, for the aim of all  training should be to bring out the best there is in a child.    [Sidenote: _\"Devotedness to duty\"_]        \"The longer on this earth we live      And weigh the various qualities of men,      The more we feel the high, stern-featured beauty      Of plain devotedness to duty;      Steadfast and still, nor paid with mortal praise,      But finding amplest recompense      For life's ungarlanded expense      In work done squarely and unwasted days.\"                   --_James Russell Lowell._    [Sidenote: _Weaving the foundation for designing_]    [Sidenote: _Honest work begets sympathy with labor_]    [Sidenote: _Interdependence in life_]    The \"Kraus-Boelte Guide\" has some good suggestions with regard to the  value of paper mat weaving, in number training, and for following  certain formulae which will lead ultimately to invention. Mme.  Kraus-Boelte says: \"Weaving leads to independent effort and offers the  greatest scope for future technical work, for it lays the foundation for  designing. Even though it may not fan into flame a latent spark of  genius, this means of occupation at least tends to show the value of  honest labor.\" The child not only recognizes the value in honest labor,  but his sympathy with all labor is aroused through his own efforts and  through the stories told of weavers in all lands. He realizes, also,  although in a limited way, the interdependence of the whole world. If  the sun did not shine, and the rain fall, there would be no grass. If  there were no grass, what would the sheep do? If the sheep did not give  any wool, what would the weaver do? If the weaver could not weave, what  would we do for clothes? Little children are always delighted to go back  to the beginning of things. Oh, the joy of looking back on one's school  days! As Friedrich Richter has truly said, \"Recollection is the only  paradise from which no man can be driven.\"    [Sidenote: _Some difficulties_]    [Sidenote: _A bit of experience_]    [Sidenote: _One solution_]    [Sidenote: _Community feeling continued_]    One important thought in this whole subject is that the work should be  so arranged as not to add any additional burden to the already crowded  life of the teacher. It is a lamentable fact that we have overcrowded  rooms, and only one pair of hands to do all that has to be done. Perhaps  a bit of the author's own experience will be of some assistance. After  looking the subject squarely in the face and considering it on all  sides, the writer came to the conclusion that it would be an  impossibility to do all the work alone. So some helpers were called from  the pupils of the higher grades, and the request met such a hearty  response that it was wondered why it had not been tried before. As it is  now arranged the older girls come in before school and at recess. They  wind worsted, correct any knitting that may be wrong, start new spools,  string looms, cut material for rugs, water plants, keep the closets  where the materials are stored in order, and do many other things which  relieve in a great measure the burden of detail. When it is possible,  the teacher should choose girls who have a sister or brother in the  room, because their interest is stronger and more lasting. Of course,  some training is necessary, but the result compensates for the trouble.  Sometimes the work in other grades can be so planned that the children  can make paper mats, etc., for use in the first grade. The beautiful  community feeling begun in the kindergarten can thus be continued in the  public school. The time will come when boys and girls in the higher  grades will design patterns for the younger children to weave.    [Sidenote: _Nature knows no hurry_]    Take plenty of time in the first part of the year to teach the children  to work well. \"Time is nothing when _power_ is growing.\" There are some  children who learn faster than others and they are always delighted to  go about the room and help the slower ones. It will sometimes be found  that they know just how to explain a difficult point--perhaps because  they have just conquered it themselves.    [Sidenote: _A child's work should be suited to his capacity, without  regard to grade_]    [Sidenote: _Train the individual_]    No work has been specified as suited to any particular grade. It should  depend entirely upon the children. While, for convenience, courses in  industrial training are planned, advising certain lines of work which  experience has proved the best for first, second, or third grade, there  are in every school, certain children who have more manual than mental  ability. These are left behind as the more favored ones are promoted,  and because a certain course has been recommended for that particular  grade, they must, perforce, do it all over again. Instead of bringing  out the best in these less fortunate ones, and developing and  strengthening their minds through the hand by offering something not  only new and interesting, but which presents new difficulties to  conquer, we stunt their growth by giving them the same baby work term  after term. It is time that earnest teachers considered this important  question. Let us give up training the _mass_ and begin to train the  _individual_. Through our interest in them they may find their life  work. If a child in the first grade is prepared to do any industrial  work of a higher grade, no matter how dull he may otherwise be, by all  means let him do it. It is his way of expressing what lies within him.  Not only will his hand and mind be trained thereby, but his heart will  be filled with the joy that always comes through achievement.    [Sidenote: _Value of hand training_]    [Sidenote: _If you would develop morality in a child, train him to  work_]    [Sidenote: _Making citizens_]    Hand training has been found to be of great value in all other work.

Coffee shops all  over the place. Coffee served freely at even the best homes. And not  only coffee ... caffeine is insiduously present in other of their  popular beverages.\"    Her eyes bulged sideways. \"But how can a so-called civilized people be  so depraved?\"    \"Caffeine doesn't seem to affect them the way it does us. Their nervous  systems are so very uncomplicated, one almost envies them.\"    Drosmig stirred restlessly under his blanket of correspondence. \"Go  back ... Fizbus,\" he muttered. \"Warn you ... 'fore ... too late ... like  me.\"    Tarb's rose-pink feathers stood on end. She looked apprehensively at  Stet.    \"Senbot can't go back because he's in no shape to take the interstel  drive.\" The young editor was obviously annoyed. \"He's old and he's a  physical wreck. But that certainly doesn't apply to you, Miss Morfatch.\"  He looked long and hard into her eyes.    \"Few years on planet,\" Drosmig groaned, struggling to his wings, \"'ply  to anybody.\"    His feathers, Tarb noticed, were an ugly, darkish brown. She had never  seen any one that color before, but she'd heard rumors that too much  caffeine could do that to you. At least she hoped it was only the  caffeine.    \"For your information, he was almost as bad as this when he came!\" Stet  snapped. \"Frankly, that's why he was sent here--to get rid of his  unfortunate addiction. Grupe had no idea, when he assigned him to Earth,  that there was caffeine on the planet.\"    The old man gave a sardonic laugh as he clumsily made his way to the  perch and gripped it with quivering toes.    \"That is, I don't _think_ he knew,\" Stet said dubiously.    Tarb reached over and picked a letter off the floor. The Fizbian  characters were clumsy and ill-made, as if someone had formed them with  his feet. Could there be such poverty here that individuals existed who  could not afford a scripto? The letter didn't read like any that had  ever been printed in the column--at least none that had been picked up  in the Fizbus edition:           *       *       *       *       *         _New York_         _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_         _I am a subaltern clerk in the shipping department of the FizbEarth       Trading Company, Inc. Although I have held this post for only three       months, I have already won the respect and esteem of my superiors       through my diligence and good character. My habits are exemplary: I       do not gamble, sing, or take caffeine._         _Earlier today, while engaged in evening meditation at my modest       apartments, I was aroused by a peremptory knock at the door. I       flung it open. A native stood there with a small case in his hand._         _\"Is the house on fire?\" I asked, wondering which of my few humble       possessions I should rescue first._         _\"No,\" he said. \"I would like to interest you in some brushes.\"_         _\"Are the offices of the FizbEarth Trading Company, Inc., on       fire?\"_         _\"Not to my knowledge,\" he replied, opening his case. \"Now I have       here a very nice hairbrush--\"_         _I wanted to give him every chance. \"Have you come to tell me of       any disaster relative to the FizbEarth Trading Company, to myself,       or to anyone or anything else with whom or with which I am       connected?\"_         _\"Why, no,\" he said. \"I have come to sell you brushes. Now here is       a little number I know you'll like. My company developed it with       you folks specially in mind. It's--\"_         _\"Do you know, sir, that you have wantonly interrupted me in the       midst of my meditations, which constitutes an established act of       privacy violation?\"_         _\"Is that a fact? Now this little item is particularly designed for       brushing the wings--\"_         _At that point, I knocked him down and punched him into       insensibility with my feet. Then I summoned the police. To my       surprise, they arrested me instead of him._         _I am writing this letter from jail. I do not like to ask my       employers to get me out because, even though I am innocent, you       know how a thing like this can leave a smudge on the record._         _What shall I do?_         _Anxiously yours,_         _Fruzmus Bloxx_           *       *       *       *       *    \"What should he do?\" Tarb asked, handing Stet the paper. \"Or is the  question academic by now? The letter's five days old.\"    Stet sighed. \"I'll find out whether the consulate has been notified.  Native police usually do that, you know. Very thoughtful fellows. If  this Bloxx hasn't been bailed out already, I'll see that he is.\"    \"But how will we answer his letter? Advise him to sue for false arrest?\"    Stet smiled. \"But he has no grounds for false arrest. He is guilty of  assault. The native was entirely within his rights in trying to sell him  a brush. Now--\" he put out a foot--\"brace yourself. Privacy violation is  not a crime on Terra. It is perfectly legal. In fact, it does not exist  as such!\"    At that point, everything went maroon.    When Tarb came to, she found herself lying upon Drosmig's desk. A  skin-faced native woman was offering her water and clucking.    \"Are you all right, Tarb--Miss Morfatch?\" Stet demanded anxiously.    \"Yes. I--I think so,\" she murmured, raising herself to a crouch.    \"Better ... have died,\" Drosmig groaned from his perch. \"Fate  worse ... death ... awaits you.\"    Tarb tried to smile. \"Sorry to have been so much trouble.\" She stuck out  her tongue at both Stet and the native.    The woman drew in her breath.    \"Miss Morfatch,\" Stet reminded Tarb, \"sticking out the tongue is not an  apology on Terra; it is an insult. Fortunately, Miss Snow happens to be  perhaps the only Terran who would not be offended. She has become  thoroughly acquainted with us and our odd little customs. She even--\" he  beamed at the Terran female--\"has learned to speak our language.\"    \"Hail to thee, O visitor from the stars,\" Miss Snow said in Fizbian.  \"May thy sojourn upon Earth be an incessant delight and may peace and  plenty shower their gifts in abundance upon thee.\"    Tarb put her hand to her aching head. \"I'm very glad to meet you,\" she  said, glad she did not have to get up to make the ritual _entrechats_.    \"Miss Snow is my right foot,\" Stet said, \"but I'm going to be noble and  let her act as your secretary until you can learn to operate a  typewriter.\"    \"Secretary? Typewriter?\"    \"Well, you see, there are no scriptos or superscriptos on Earth and we  can't import any from Home because the natives--\" Miss Snow  smiled--\"don't have the right kind of power here to run psychic  installations. All prosifying has to be done directly on prosifying  machines or--\" he paused--\"by foot.\"    \"Catch her!\" Miss Snow exclaimed in Terran.    Everything had gone maroon for Tarb again. As she fell, she could hear a  sudden thump. It was, she later discovered, Drosmig falling off his  perch again--the result of insecure grip, she was given to understand,  rather than excessive empathy.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I didn't mean, of course, to give you the impression that we actually  produce the individual copies of the papers ourselves,\" Stet explained  over the dinner table that night. \"We have native printers who do that.  They've turned out some really remarkable Fizbian type fonts.\" \"Very  clever of them,\" Tarb said, knowing that was what she was expected to  say. She glanced around the restaurant. In their low-cut evening  garments, the Terrestrial females looked much less Fizboid than they had  during the day. All that naked-looking skin; one would think they'd want  to cover it. Probably they were sick with jealousy of her beautiful  rose-colored down--what they could see of it, anyway.    \"Of course, our real problem is getting proofreaders. The proofing  machines won't operate here either, of course, and so we need human  personnel. But what Fizbian would do such degrading work? We had thought  of convict labor, but--\"    \"Why mustn't I take off my wrap?\" Tarb interrupted. \"No one else is  wearing one.\"    Stet coughed. \"You'll feel much less self-conscious about your wings if  you keep it on. And try not to use your feet so conspicuously. I'm sure  everyone understands you need them to eat with, but--\"    \"But I'm not in the least self-conscious about my wings. On Fizbus, they  were considered rather nice-looking, if I do say so myself.\"    \"It's better,\" he said firmly, \"not to emphasize the differences between  the natives and ourselves. You didn't object to wearing a Terrestrial  costume, did you?\"    \"No, I realize I must make some concessions to native prudery, but--\"    \"Matter of fact, I've been thinking it would be a good idea for you to  wear a stole or a cape or something in the daytime when you go to and  from the office. You wouldn't want to make yourself or the _Times_  conspicuous, I'm sure.... No, waiter, no coffee. We'll take champagne.\"    \"I want to try coffee,\" Tarb said mutinously. \"Champagne! You'd think I  was a fledgling, giving me that bubbly stuff!\"    He looked at her. \"Now don't be silly, Miss Morfatch ... Tarb. I can't  let you indulge in such rash experiments. You realize I am responsible  for you.\"    Tarb muttered darkly into her _coupe maison_.    Stet raised his eyebrows. \"What did you say?\"    \"I was only wondering whether you'd remembered to check on whether that  young man--Bloxx--ever did get out of jail.\"    Stet snapped his toes. \"Glad you reminded me. Completely slipped my  mind. Let's go and see what happened to him, shall we?\"           *       *       *       *       *    As they rose to leave, a dumpy Earthwoman rushed up to them,"]]]
