It is rather disappointing  though, to have come half round the world only to be met by men like  these. The pilot might be own brother to his fellow-craftsman who took  us down the Channel, and his crew are just the same kind of brawny,  bearded, amphibious-looking men that are to be seen any day in an  English seaport. We had nourished an insane kind of hope that we should  have been boarded by a canoe full of Maoris, in all the savage splendour  of tattooing and paint and feathers; but here, instead of all that  romantic fancy, are three or four ordinary \"long-shore\" boatmen, with a  pilot who steps on board in the most matter-of-fact manner possible.    Well, we must make the best we can out of the circumstances; so, when  the pilot has come out of the captain's cabin, where he has shown his  certificate and discussed his \"nobbler,\" when he has formally taken  charge of the ship, and we are once more moving through the water, we  begin to pester him with the question, \"What's the news?\"    Now, as we have been between three and four months at sea, isolated from  the rest of the world, we are naturally all agog to hear what has  happened in our absence. New Zealand's news of the old world is at least  a month old, but then that is considerably in advance of our dates. The  pilot has, therefore, enough to do in answering all the questions that  are levelled at him, and as he is probably pretty well accustomed to  similar experiences, he is, I fear, in the habit of allowing his fancy  to supply any gaps in his actual knowledge of the progress of events;  hence we glean many scraps of information that on further inquiry turn  out to be more or less imaginative.    And now that we are entering the harbour of Auckland, it is  unfortunately getting too dark to see much. There is not a long gloaming  in northern New Zealand--once the sun has dropped below the horizon  darkness succeeds very rapidly; so, though we get an indistinct glimpse  at some houses on the shore as we sail along, it is quite dark as we  round the North Shore and come into Auckland harbour.    There goes the anchor at last, with a plunge and a rattle! Now the good  ship is swinging in the current of the Waitemata, and the voyage, that  at its commencement seemed so long and that now appears to have been so  short, is fairly terminated. Before us, extending to right and left, and  up and down, are thousands of lights glittering and twinkling over the  shadowy outlines of the city; while into our ears is borne the welcome  hum and stir of city life. There is no going ashore until next  morning--until the health officer and the customs shall have boarded and  inspected us. So that night is devoted to the bustle and confusion of  packing up; and various spoony couples moon about the decks, renewing  promises and vows in expectation of their parting on the morrow.    When morning comes we make our bow to Auckland. There it lies, this  Antipodean city, looking so white and clean and fair in the morning  sunshine, stretching away to right and left, rising in streets and  terraces from the shore, cresting the heights with steeples and  villa-roofs, and filling up the valleys below. In the far background is  the heavy brow of Mount Eden, whose extinct crater we shall explore  by-and-by, and whence we shall obtain a splendid view of the entire  city, its suburbs, and the surrounding country.    From our point of view out in the harbour the city presents a scattered  and uneven appearance, that adds to its generally picturesque aspect. As  a central feature are the long lines of wharves and quays with their  clustering shipping; just beyond these is evidently the densest part of  the city. Huge and imposing stone buildings stand thickly here, showing  that it is the centre of the business part of Auckland. To right and  left the ground rises abruptly and steeply, and the streets become  irregular in outline. Nor is the shore a straight and continuous line;  these heights on either hand are promontories jutting out into the  stream, and hiding deep bays behind them, round which, straggling and  irregular, sweeps the city.    The further our eyes travel from the centre of the picture, the more do  we lose sight of any trace of uniformity in building. Quite close to the  busy parts, so it seems to us, houses stand in their own wide gardens;  the streets and roads are lost amid the embowering foliage of trees and  shrubs. The house-structures are built on every conceivable plan, up and  down the wooded shores; every builder has evidently been his own  architect to a great extent, and there is no lack of elbow-room  hereaway.    What surprise us most are the evidences of taste and cultivation and  general prosperity everywhere in view. Our previous glimpses at the  shore of our new country had not prepared us for anything like this. It  is decidedly encouraging to new-comers, who are disturbed somewhat by  the prospect of doing battle with the wilderness, to find a sort of  Anglo-Saxon Naples here in the Southern Sea.    We had an idea that our arrival would have been quite an event in this  little place. Nothing of the sort; Aucklanders are too well used to the  arrival of emigrant ships. One or two enter the harbour every month,  besides other craft; and then the Pacific Mail steamers, large and  splendidly equipped vessels, call here twice a month on their way to and  fro between Sydney and San Francisco.    There are one or two vessels like ours lying out in the stream at the  present time, others are lying alongside the principal wharf, or its  cross-tees, amid a forest of spars belonging to small coasting craft.  Plenty of shore boats have come off to us on one errand or another; but  it is evident that our arrival has not created that impression upon the  city which we had had a notion that it would have done.    The morning papers will notice our advent, with a brief account of the  voyage, and will give exceedingly inaccurate lists of our passengers.  Only those people who expect friends or cargo by us will take any  special interest in us; the evening promenaders on the wharf will glance  at our ship with a brief passing interest; and the current of Auckland  life will flow on unchanged, regardless of the fact that some three  hundred more souls have been absorbed into its population.    Breakfast this morning is partaken of in the midst of a hurry-skurry of  excitement, but, for all that, it is an imposing meal, and comprises all  sorts of luxuries to which we have long been strangers. Beefsteaks,  milk, eggs, fruit, and vegetables, fresh fish just caught over the side,  and other fondly-loved delicacies are on the bill of fare. By-and-by,  all formalities having been gone through, comes the parting with  shipmates and the confusion of landing.    It is not without a strong feeling of astonishment that we step out of  the boat that has brought us off, and enter the city. We were totally  unprepared for the scene before us. From the accounts we had read and  received, we had pictured Auckland to our minds as little better than a  collection of log-huts, with here and there, perhaps, a slightly more  comfortable frame-house. And here is the reality. A city that would put  to shame many an old English town. A main street--Queen Street--that  might even compare favourably with many a leading London thoroughfare in  all its details. Fine handsome edifices of stone, with elaborate  architecture and finish; large plate-glass shop-windows, filled with a  display of wares; gas-lamps, pillar letter-boxes, pavements, awnings,  carts, carriages, and cabs; all the necessities, luxuries, and  appurtenances of city life, civilized and complete.    Truly, all this is a wonderful surprise to us. Our preconceived ideas,  gathered from various books dating only a few years back, had led our  fancies completely astray. Learning from these sources that, not much  more than thirty years ago--in 1840,--the first ship-load of British  emigrants landed in New Zealand; that since then the colony had  struggled for bare life against many and great difficulties; that it had  had to wage several desperate wars with the aborigines; had had its  financial and legislative troubles; and was still so very very young, we  were naturally prepared to find Auckland a rude, rough, and inchoate  settlement, pitched down in the midst of a wilderness as savage and  uncouth as those shores we passed along yesterday.    We know that a very few years ago, Auckland really was but what we had  fancied it still would be, and so we comprehend now how little the  people at home actually realize of the conditions of life at their  Antipodes. Moreover, as we pass along the streets of this British city,  set down here on the shaggy shores of Britain's under-world, in the very  heart of recent Maori-dom, so remote and far removed from the tracks of  ancient civilization, we look around us and are filled with wonder and a  feeling akin to awe. This is what colonization means; this is the work  of colonists; this is the evidence of energy that may well seem titanic,  of industry that appears herculean; this is Progress! The thought  thrills us through and through. We, too, have made our entry into the  new world; we, too, have crossed the threshold of colonial life; and  thus to-day, at the outset of our new life, our minds have opened to  receive the first true lesson of the colonist.          CHAPTER II.    AUCKLAND.      Passing up Queen Street, after landing on the wharf, a party of us  notice--or fancy we notice--a rather singular feature in the Aucklanders  we meet. The men are grave and serious in deportment, and nearly all are  profusely bearded; but one of us draws attention to the fact that all  have strangely aquiline noses. Hebrews they are not--we know, they are  of the same nationality as ourselves--so we seek explanation from a  whimsical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#3)"],[1,"be better than the example and instruction given by  themselves. Those who have been faithful and industrious in service,  will generally retain those habits in their own families, after they are  married; while those who have borne an opposite character are seldom  successful in the world, but more frequently reduced to beggary and  want.    It is in general a good maxim, to select servants not younger than  thirty. Before that age, however comfortable you may endeavour to make  them, their want of experience, and the hope of something still better,  prevent their being satisfied with their present state. After they have  had the benefit of experience, if they are tolerably comfortable, they  will endeavour to deserve the smiles of even a moderately kind master or  mistress, for fear they may change for the worse. Life may indeed be  very fairly divided into the seasons of hope and fear. In youth, we hope  every thing may be right: in age, we fear that every thing may be wrong.  At any rate it is desirable to engage a good and capable servant, for  one of this description eats no more than a bad one. Considering also  how much waste is occasioned by provisions being dressed in a slovenly  and unskilful manner, and how much a good cook, to whom the conduct of  the kitchen is confided, can save by careful management, it is clearly  expedient to give better wages for one of this description, than to  obtain a cheaper article which in the end will inevitably become more  expensive. It is likewise a point of prudence to invite the honesty and  industry of domestics, by setting them an example of liberality in this  way; nothing is more likely to convince them of the value that is  attached to talent and good behaviour, or to bind them to the interest  of those whom they are engaged to serve. The office of the cook  especially is attended with so many difficulties, so many disgusting and  disagreeable circumstances, and even dangers, in order to procure us one  of the greatest enjoyments of human life, that it is but justice to  reward her attention and services, by rendering her situation every way  as comfortable as we can. Those who think, that to protect and encourage  virtue is the best preventive to vice, should give their female servants  liberal wages. How else can they provide themselves the necessary  articles of clothing, and save a little to help themselves in a time of  a sickness, when out of place, or amidst the infirmities of age. The  want of liberality and of justice in this respect is a principal source  of the distress and of the degradation to which multitudes of females  are reduced, and who are driven at length to seek an asylum in Foundling  Hospitals and Female Penitentiaries.    Good wages however are not all that a faithful servant requires; kind  treatment is of far greater consequence. Human nature is the same in all  stations. If you can convince your servants that you have a generous and  considerate regard for their health and comfort, there is no reason to  imagine that they will be insensible to the good they receive. Be  careful therefore to impose no commands but what are reasonable, nor  reprove but with justice and temper; the best way to ensure which is,  not to lecture them till at least one day after the offence has been  committed. If they have any particular hardship to endure in service,  let them see that you are concerned for the necessity of imposing it.  Servants are more likely to be praised into good conduct, than scolded  out of bad behaviour. Always commend them when they do right; and to  cherish in them the desire of pleasing, it is proper to show them that  you are pleased. By such conduct ordinary servants will often be  converted into good ones, and there are few so hardened as not to feel  gratified when they are kindly and liberally treated. At the same time  avoid all approaches to familiarity, which to a proverb is accompanied  with contempt, and soon destroys the principle of obedience.    When servants are sick, you are to remember that you are their patron,  as well as their master or mistress; not only remit their labour, but  give them all the assistance of food and physic, and every comfort in  your power. Tender assiduity about an invalid is half a cure; it is a  balsam to the mind, which has the most powerful effect on the body; it  soothes the sharpest pains, and strengthens beyond the richest cordial.  The practice of some persons in sending home poor servants to a  miserable cottage, or to a workhouse, in time of illness, hoping for  their services if they should happen to recover, while they contribute  nothing towards it, is contrary to every principle of justice and  humanity. Particular attention ought to be paid to the health of the  cook, not only for her own sake, but also because healthiness and  cleanliness are essential to the duties of her office, and to the  wholesomeness of the dishes prepared by her hand. Besides the  deleterious vapours of the charcoal, which soon undermine the health of  the heartiest person, the cook has to endure the glare of a scorching  fire, and the smoke, so baneful to the complexion and the eyes; so that  she is continually surrounded with inevitable dangers, while her most  commendable achievements pass not only without reward, but frequently  without even thanks. The most consummate cook is seldom noticed by the  master, or heard of by the guests, who, while they eagerly devour his  dainties, and drink his wine, care very little who dressed the one or  sent the other. The same observations apply to the kitchen maid or  second cook, who have in large families the hardest place, and are  worse paid, verifying the old proverb, 'the more work the less wages.'  If there be any thing right, the cook has the praise, when any praise is  given: if any thing be wrong, the kitchen maid has the blame. For this  humble domestic is expected by the cook to take the entire management of  all roasts and boils, fish and vegetables, which together constitute the  principal part of an Englishman's dinner. The master or mistress who  wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table well served in the best  stile, should treat the cook as a friend; should watch over her health  with peculiar care, and be sure that her taste does not suffer, by her  stomach being deranged by bilious attacks. A small proportion of that  attention usually bestowed on a favourite horse, or even a dog, would  suffice to regulate her animal system. Cleanliness, and a proper  ventilation to carry off smoke and steam, should be particularly  attended to in the construction of a kitchen. The grand scene of action,  the fire-place, should be placed where it may receive plenty of light.  Too often the contrary practice has prevailed, and the poor cook is  continually basted with her own perspiration; but a good state of health  can never be preserved under such circumstances.      _Necessity of Order and Regularity._    No family can be properly managed, where the strictest order and  regularity is not observed. 'A house divided against itself cannot  stand;' and if the direction of its affairs be left to accident or  chance, it will be equally fatal to its comfort and prosperity. It is  the part of a prudent manager to see all that is doing, and to foresee  and direct all that should be done. The weakest capacity can perceive  what is wrong after it has occurred; but discernment and discretion are  necessary to anticipate and prevent confusion and disorder, by a  well-regulated system of prompt and vigorous management. If time be  wisely economised, and the useful affairs transacted before amusements  are allowed, and a regular plan of employment be daily laid down, a  great deal may be done without hurry or fatigue. The retrospect would  also be most pleasant at the end of the year, to be able to enumerate  all the valuable acquirements made, and the just and benevolent actions  performed, under the active and energetic management of the mistress of  a family. As highly conducive to this end, early and regular hours  should be kept in the evening, and an early hour especially for  breakfast in the morning. There will then be more time to execute the  orders that may be given, which in general should comprise the business  of the day; and servants, by doing their work with ease, will be more  equal to it, and fewer of them will be necessary. It is worthy of  notice, that the general expense will be reduced, and much time saved,  if every thing be kept in its proper place, applied to its proper use,  and mended, when the nature of the accident will allow, as soon as  broken or out of repair. A proper quantity of household articles should  always be ready, and more bought in before the others are consumed, to  prevent inconvenience, especially in the country. Much trouble and  irregularity would be prevented when there is company to dinner, if the  servants were required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar  order daily. As some preparation is necessary for accidental visitors,  care should be taken to have constantly in readiness a few articles  suited to such occasions, which if properly managed will be attended  with little expense, and much convenience.      _Bad habit of keeping Spare Rooms._    Though persons of large fortune may support an expensive establishment  without inconvenience, it ill becomes those in the middle rank to  imitate such an example. Nothing can be more ludicrous than the contrast  exhibited between two families of this description; the one living in  the dignified splendour, and with the liberal hospitality, that wealth  can command; the other in a stile of tinsel show, without the real  appropriate distinctions belonging to rank and fortune. They are lavish,  but not liberal, often sacrificing independence to support dissipation,  and betraying the dearest interests of society for the sake of personal  vanity, and"]]]
