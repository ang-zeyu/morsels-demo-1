In 1942 four observations were made, in 1950  and 1951 two observations were recorded each year, and in other years  only one observation was recorded each year. Nine observations are for  Chapin Mesa south of Far View; only two observations are for higher  elevations on the North Rim.      Sylvilagus audubonii warreni Nelson Desert Cottontail         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Head of Prater Canyon, MV       7850/507; Far View Ruins, 75974, ad. [Female], non-pregnant,       November 8, 1957.    One specimen was shot, while it was sitting near a pile of logs, by J.R.  Alcorn by means of a bow and arrow. Although _S. audubonii_ occurs on  the Mesa along with _S. nuttallii_, _S. audubonii_ is the species of the  lowlands throughout the western United States at the latitude of Mesa  Verde National Park. For example, _S. a. warreni_ (69260) but not _S. n.  pinetis_ was obtained along the east side of the Mancos River at 6200  feet elevation (less than 50 yards outside the Park) and the same was  true at the same elevation at a place 4-1/2 mi. N of the Park (No. 69259  from 2 mi. E Cortez).      Sylvilagus nuttallii pinetis (J.A. Allen) Nuttall's Cottontail         _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: ad. [Male], 69263, skull only,       dead on road, 1-3/4 mi. N Park Headquarters, 7275 feet, August 9,       1956; ad. [Female], 69261, no embryos, dead on road, 3/4 mi. S       and 1-3/4 mi. W Park Point, 8000 ft, August 8, 1956; ad. [Male],       69262, shot in brushy area on the burn on Wetherill Mesa 2 mi. NNW       Rock Springs, 7900 ft., August 24, 1956.    Nuttall's cottontail in Colorado is in general the cottontail of the  highlands, and the three localities just mentioned are on the top of the  Mesa Verde.      Sciurus aberti mimus Merriam Abert's Squirrel         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: [Male], MV 7872/507, prepared       by D. Watson, killed by a car \"near\" the Park Well on September 24,       1937; [Female] (an unnumbered cased skin only), found dead       \"near\" the Park Well on June 21, 1937.    Since 1934 these squirrels have been observed and recorded each year  except in 1938, 1943, 1947, 1953, 1957, and 1958. The 77 reported  observations can be grouped as follows: 11 from within a mile of the  entrance to the Park, 14 from the North Rim or higher parts of canyons  adjacent to it, 38 from Chapin Mesa south of Far View, and 14 not  classifiable. The large number of observations on Chapin Mesa, chiefly  in the vicinity of Park Headquarters, indicates the presence of more  observers rather than more squirrels in this area.      Tamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti (Audubon and Bachman) Red Squirrel         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: MV 7843/507, Chickaree Draw,       Prater Canyon, 1935, C.W. Quaintance and Lloyd White; [Female],       69264, no embryos, 1/4 mi. NNW Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7600       ft., August 31, 1956.    Red squirrels, or chickarees as they are called in Colorado, are known  from only one place on the Mesa Verde, a side canyon on the west side of  Prater Canyon above Middle Well. This side canyon has been named  Chickaree Draw by C.W. Quaintance, who, with Lloyd White, studied the  chickaree there in 1935. Quaintance reported the small colony at 7800  feet elevation in Douglas fir beneath which were found piles of cones  from which the seeds had been eaten by the chickarees. On May 29, 1935,  White observed a chickaree eating green oak leaves. On June 3, 1935, a  nest was found in an old hollow snag up under the rim rock; there were  four young squirrels in the nest. At least one nest was in a juniper and  was composed mostly of oak leaves and grass. One nest twenty-five feet  from the ground in a Douglas fir was composed of oak leaves and finely  shredded cedar bark. In August, 1956, I found these squirrels in the  same area and I shot one specimen. Other chickarees were seen and heard  and the characteristic piles of parts of Douglas fir cones still attest  to their presence. On September 1, 1953, D. Watson observed a pair of  chickarees in Prater Canyon. The only other specific record in the files  at the Park is of two seen in a branch of Soda Canyon in late 1956. Jean  Pinkley tells me that chickarees have been observed in 1958 and 1959 at  several other localities from Prater Canyon to the hill at the head of  Navajo Canyon. The extent to which increased observations indicate an  increase in number of chickarees is uncertain, since the amounts of time  spent in the field and the percentage of observations recorded are not  known.      Marmota flaviventris luteola A.H. Howell Yellow-bellied Marmot    Records are available of observations at 14 different places in the Park  and in 19 different years between 1930 and 1960. Approximately  two-thirds of the observations have been on Prater Grade or in upper  Prater Canyon or in upper Morfield Canyon. On the morning of August 24,  1956, Harold Shepherd and I heard the whistle of an animal that he was  certain was a marmot, 2 mi. NNW of Rock Springs at the west rim of  Wetherill Mesa. Mr. Shepherd has worked in areas occupied by marmots for  years in southwestern Colorado. Wetherill Mesa is the locality farthest  west in the Park where marmots are known to occur. They occur as far  south as Cliff Palace.      Cynomys gunnisoni zuniensis Hollister Gunnison's Prairie Dog         _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: MV 7836/507, Prater Canyon, 7600       ft., C.W. Quaintance and L. White, May 24, 1935; [Female], MV       7847/507, head of Prater Canyon, June 13, 1935, C.W. Quaintance       (the skin is on display); MV 7887/507, Prater Canyon, September 1,       1939.    C.W. Quaintance in reports on the results of his work in 1935 included  the following information:    On February 20 in Prater Canyon Ranger Markley noticed that prairie dogs  were active although about three feet of snow lay on the ground. Between  April 15 and May 15 approximately 500 prairie dogs were in Prater Canyon  above Lower Well; through field glasses 350 were counted. Young were  first noted in Prater Canyon on July 12. Quaintance and Lloyd White had  under observation two bulky nests of the red-tailed hawk in the tops of  tall Douglas firs in side draws of Prater Canyon. Quaintance found near  the rimrock a quarter of a mile from the prairie-dog town the skeletons  of two prairie dogs between a sliver of a dead pinyon branch and the  branch itself. Another skeleton lay on a dead limb fifteen feet from the  ground. A red-tailed hawk once was observed to swoop down, seize a  prairie dog and fly down the canyon. The four colonies found in the Park  were in Prater Canyon, in Morfield Canyon, in the east fork of School  Section Canyon, and in Whites Canyon. The last two were smaller colonies  than the first two.    Prairie dogs were observed away from these colonies. On June 20 a young  prairie dog ran into a culvert on the Knife Edge Section of the road.  Others were observed on the north side of the road, at the head of the  east prong of School Section Canyon, on the road west of Park Point, and  on the road at the head of Long Canyon five miles from the nearest known  colony in the Park. Possibly this last individual came from the  Montezuma Valley north of the Park. Mr. Prater, after whom Prater Canyon  is named, homesteaded on the Mesa Verde in 1899. He informed Quaintance  that prairie dogs were present in Morfield Canyon prior to 1900 but were  not in Prater Canyon in 1899. Prater said he drowned out a few that came  into Prater Canyon before 1914. In 1942, Chief Ranger Faha wrote in his  Annual Animal Census Report that he had interviewed an old time resident  (name not noted) who stated that prairie dogs were not present on the  Mesa Verde until about 1905 or 1906 and that Helen Morfield, the  daughter of Judge Morfield who homesteaded in Morfield Canyon, brought  the first prairie dogs on the Mesa Verde. Estimates of the prairie-dog  population in the Annual Animal Census Reports for 1935 through 1941  were: 1935--800, 1936--650, 1937--650, 1938--650, 1939--no report,  1940--1500 and increasing, 1941--slight decrease. After 1942 more  adequate records were kept by Chief Ranger Wade and other Park Service  personnel.    On August 9, 1943, occupied burrows of prairie dogs were found to be  thinly scattered down Prater Canyon from the head of the canyon at the  Maintenance Camp to a point about one hundred feet below the lower well.  The largest concentration was in the vicinity of the upper well near  Prater's Cabin. Little new digging that would indicate a spreading  population was noticed. Seemingly desirable, but unoccupied, habitat  extended at least two miles south of the inhabited area. In Morfield  Canyon, burrows were found from a point one hundred yards north of the  fence at the south boundary of Section 17, south for a mile and one-half  to a point one-third of a mile into Section 29. The greatest  concentration was in the vicinity of Morfield Well. South of this point  the burrows were found only along the narrow dry sides of the canyon and  in sage-covered areas at slightly higher elevations than the rest of the  floor of the canyon. Seemingly desirable habitat extended at least three  miles to the south and one mile to the north of the occupied area. The  report of the study in 1943 concluded with the statement that artificial  control by poisoning would be unwise and unnecessary. Requests were  being made at that time to exterminate prairie dogs in the Park on the  basis of the unproved assumption that prairie dogs move from the Park to  surrounding range land where extermination was then being attempted by  poisoning.

[Illustration: FIG. 6. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Right  mandible, lateral view, KU 10295, x 4. External surfaces are pitted;  broken surfaces are coarsely stippled.]      VERTEBRAE (Fig. 7)    The vertebrae that are visible from a lateral view are crushed and  difficult to interpret. It is possible, nevertheless, to see that the  trunk vertebrae resemble those of Ichthyostegalia (Jarvik, 1952, Fig.  13 A, B), except that the pleurocentra are much larger. A few parts of  additional vertebrae can be seen, but they are so scattered that it is  impossible to be sure of their original location. Therefore comparisons  between different regions cannot yet be made.    The U-shaped intercentrum encloses the notochord and occupies an  anteroventral position in the vertebra. Anteriorly, each intercentrum  articulates with the pleurocentra of the next preceding vertebra by  slightly concave surfaces. Dorsolaterally there is an articular surface  for the capitulum of the rib.    The two pleurocentra of each vertebra are separate ventrally as well as  dorsally, but form thin, broad plates of about the same height as the  notochord. The lateral surface appears to be depressed, allowing,  perhaps, for movement of the rib. Above each pleurocentrum, on the  lateral surface of the neural arch, there is a short diapophysis for  articulation with the tuberculum of the rib.    The margin of the neural spine is convex anteriorly and concave  posteriorly, the tip reaching a point vertically above the  postzygapophysis. The prezygapophysis of each vertebra articulates  with the preceding postzygapophysis by a smooth dorsal surface. One  nearly complete neural arch shows (Fig. 7 B) a pit above the neural  canal, clearly corresponding to the canal for a dorsal ligament shown  by Jarvik in _Ichthyostega_. Indeed this view of the neural arch and  intercentrum together brings out the striking resemblance between the  vertebrae of _Hesperoherpeton_ and those of the Ichthyostegids. The  rounded intercentrum in both is an incomplete ring enclosing the  notochordal canal.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody.

The dorsal portion of this  neural arch is not present (either broken or not yet ossified), but  the opening of the neural canal is comparable in width to the foramen  magnum. Hence this vertebra may be one of the most anterior in the  column. In comparison with the trunk vertebrae seen farther posteriorly  it appears that there may be a progressive ossification of neural  arches toward their dorsal ends, and of intercentra around the  notochord, with probable fusion of the intercentra and neural arches in  the posterior part of the trunk. The notochord seems to have been  slightly constricted by the intercentra, but not interrupted.      RIBS    The proximal ends of the ribs expand dorsoventrally to a width  approximately four times that of their slender shafts. The tuberculum  and capitulum on each of the trunk ribs are separated only by a shallow  concavity. These two articular surfaces are so situated that the rib  must tilt downward from the horizontal plane. The shaft flares  terminally in some ribs, and the distal end is convex. Ribs in the  trunk region differ little if any in size. Five that can be measured  vary in length from 5.0 to 7.0 mm. One short, bent rib 3.5 mm. long  perhaps is sacral or caudal.      PECTORAL GIRDLE (Figs. 8, 9, 10)    The right scapulocoracoid is almost complete, and the left one is  present but partly broken into three pieces, somewhat pushed out of  position. With the advantage of this new material, we may comment on  the scapulocoracoid of _H. garnettense_ as described by Peabody (1958).  In size and contour, the slight differences between the type (KU 9976)  and the new skeleton (KU 10295) are considered to be no more than  individual variation. We have redrawn the type (Fig. 8) in order to  show the resemblances more clearly.    The small sections that were missing from the type are present in KU  10295. The jagged edge directly posterior to the area occupied by the  neural arch in the type extends 0.5 mm. farther back in our specimen.  The angle formed between the recurved dorsal ramus and the edge of the  ventral flange is seen in our specimen to be less than 90 deg.. The glenoid  fossa, appearing as a concave articular surface for the cap of the  humerus, was in part covered by cartilage and shows as \"unfinished\"  bone (Peabody, 1958, p. 572); this area is more oval than triangular,  as Peabody thought. The obstruction of a clear view of this part of the  type is the result of the accidental position of a neural arch. The  raised portion immediately dorsal to the glenoid fossa exhibits an  unfinished surface, suggesting the presence of either cartilage or a  ligament.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Type  specimen redrawn. Right scapulocoracoid in external view (at left), and  internal view (at right). KU 9976, x 4.]      [Illustration: FIG. 9. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Right  scapulocoracoid in external view, showing part of interclavicle, and  position occupied by clavicle. The specimen is flattened and lies  entirely in one plane. KU 10295, x 4.]      [Illustration: FIG. 10. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Right  clavicle in external view. Anterior edge to right. KU 10295, x 4.]    The right clavicle is complete, and resembles a spoon having a slender  handle. The dorsal tip of the handle is L-shaped. The expanded ventral  part is convex externally, and rested upon the anteroventral surface of  the scapulocoracoid. The lateral edge next to the \"stem\" is distinctly  concave, abruptly becoming similar in contour to the opposite edge, and  giving the impression of an unsymmetrical spoon. The left clavicle is  present in scattered fragments, its dorsal hooklike end being intact.    The posterior end of the interclavicle lies in contact with the right  scapulocoracoid. There are short lateral processes at the point where  the interclavicle was overlapped by the clavicles, but we cannot be  sure of the extent of this bone anteriorly or posteriorly.    The presumed left cleithrum, a long rectangle, is approximately equal  in length to the rodlike stem of the clavicle, and is about as wide as  the dorsal L-shaped tip of the clavicle. The posterior end of the  cleithrum presumably met the tip of the clavicle, while the rest of it  was directed anteriorly and a little dorsally. There seems to be a  small articular surface near the anterior extremity which suggests the  presence of a supracleithrum. The upper border of the cleithrum is  slightly convex and the lower concave.      FORELIMB (Fig. 11)    The left forelimb is the only one present and appears to be nearly  complete, although the elements are scattered almost at random. The  only parts of the forelimb known to be missing are two subterminal and  two terminal phalanges, probably of the first and third digits, and the  proximal end of the second metacarpal. The smooth and relatively flat  surfaces suggest an aquatic rather than terrestrial limb; only the  proximal half of the humerus bears any conspicuous ridges or  depressions. As we restore the skeleton of the limb, several features  are remarkable: The humerus, ulna, and ulnare align themselves as the  major axis of the limb, each carrying on its posterior edge a process  or flange comparable to those in the axial series of a rhipidistian  fin. The remaining elements take positions comparable to the diagonally  placed preaxial radials in such a fin. The digits appear to have been  short, perhaps with no more than two phalanges. There is only one row  of carpals present (the proximal row of other tetrapods). A second and  third row would be expected in primitive Amphibia; if they existed in  _Hesperoherpeton_ they must either have been wholly cartilaginous or  washed away from the specimen. Neither of these alternatives seems at  all likely to us in view of the well-ossified condition of the elements  that are present, and the occurrence of both the proximal carpals and  the metacarpals. The space available for metacarpals probably could not  have contained more than the four that are recognized.    [Illus"]]]
