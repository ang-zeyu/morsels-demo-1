What is wanted is a  dry dust, which greedily absorbs the disgorged saliva and forms with the  latter's albuminous elements a sort of readily-hardening Roman cement,  something in short resembling the cement which we obtain with quicklime  and white of egg.    The mortar-quarry which the Sicilian Mason-bee prefers to work is a  frequented highway, whose metal of chalky flints, crushed by the passing  wheels, has become a smooth surface, like a continuous flagstone.  Whether settling on a twig in a hedge or fixing her abode under the  eaves of some rural dwelling, she always goes for her building-materials  to the nearest path or road, without allowing herself to be distracted  from her business by the constant traffic of people and cattle. You  should see the active Bee at work when the road is dazzling white  under the rays of a hot sun. Between the adjoining farm, which is the  building-yard, and the road, in which the mortar is prepared, we hear  the deep hum of the Bees perpetually crossing one another as they go  to and fro. The air seems traversed by incessant trails of smoke, so  straight and rapid is the worker's flight. Those on the way to the nest  carry tiny pellets of mortar, the size of small shot; those who return  at once settle on the driest and hardest spots. Their whole body  aquiver, they scrape with the tips of their mandibles and rake with  their front tarsi to extract atoms of earth and grains of sand, which,  rolled between their teeth, become impregnated with saliva and form  a solid mass. The work is pursued so vigorously that the worker lets  herself be crushed under the feet of the passers-by rather than abandon  her task.    On the other hand, the Mason-bee of the Walls, who seeks solitude,  far from human habitations, rarely shows herself on the beaten paths,  perhaps because these are too far from the places where she builds. So  long as she can find dry earth, rich in small gravel, near the pebble  chosen as the site of her nest, that is all she asks.    The Bee may either build an entirely new nest on a site as yet  unoccupied, or she may use the cells of an old nest, after repairing  them. Let us consider the former case first. After selecting her pebble,  the Mason-bee of the Walls arrives with a little ball of mortar in her  mandibles and lays it in a circular pad on the surface of the stone.  The fore-legs and above all the mandibles, which are the mason's chief  tools, work the material, which is kept plastic by the salivary fluid as  this is gradually disgorged. In order to consolidate the clay, angular  bits of gravel, the size of a lentil, are inserted separately, but only  on the outside, in the as yet soft mass. This is the foundation of the  structure. Fresh layers follow, until the cell has attained the desired  height of two or three centimetres. (Three-quarters of an inch to one  inch.--Translator's Note.)    Man's masonry is formed of stones laid one above the other and cemented  together with lime. The Chalicodoma's work can bear comparison with  ours. To economise labour and mortar, the Bee employs coarse materials,  big pieces of gravel, which to her represent hewn stones. She chooses  them carefully one by one, picks out the hardest bits, generally with  corners which, fitting one into the other, give mutual support and  contribute to the solidity of the whole. Layers of mortar, sparingly  applied, hold them together. The outside of the cell thus assumes  the appearance of a piece of rustic architecture, in which the stones  project with their natural irregularities; but the inside, which  requires a more even surface in order not to hurt the larva's tender  skin, is covered with a coat of pure mortar. This inner whitewash,  however, is put on without any attempt at art, indeed one might say  that it is ladled on in great splashes; and the grub takes care, after  finishing its mess of honey, to make itself a cocoon and hang the rude  walls of its abode with silk. On the other hand, the Anthophorae and  the Halicti, two species of Wild Bees whose grubs weave no cocoon,  delicately glaze the inside of their earthen cells and give them the  gloss of polished ivory.    The structure, whose axis is nearly always vertical and whose orifice  faces upwards so as not to let the honey escape, varies a little  in shape according to the supporting base. When set on a horizontal  surface, it rises like a little oval tower; when fixed against an  upright or slanting surface, it resembles the half of a thimble divided  from top to bottom. In this case, the support itself, the pebble,  completes the outer wall.    When the cell is finished, the Bee at once sets to work to victual it.  The flowers round about, especially those of the yellow broom (Genista  scoparia), which in May deck the pebbly borders of the mountain streams  with gold, supply her with sugary liquid and pollen. She comes with her  crop swollen with honey and her belly yellowed underneath with pollen  dust. She dives head first into the cell; and for a few moments you see  some spasmodic jerks which show that she is disgorging the honey-syrup.  After emptying her crop, she comes out of the cell, only to go in again  at once, but this time backwards. The Bee now brushes the lower side  of her abdomen with her two hind-legs and rids herself of her load of  pollen. Once more she comes out and once more goes in head first. It is  a question of stirring the materials, with her mandibles for a spoon,  and making the whole into a homogeneous mixture. This mixing-operation  is not repeated after every journey: it takes place only at long  intervals, when a considerable quantity of material has been  accumulated.    The victualling is complete when the cell is half full. An egg must now  be laid on the top of the paste and the house must be closed. All this  is done without delay. The cover consists of a lid of pure mortar, which  the Bee builds by degrees, working from the circumference to the centre.  Two days at most appeared to me to be enough for everything, provided  that no bad weather--rain or merely clouds--came to interrupt  the labour. Then a second cell is built, backing on the first and  provisioned in the same manner. A third, a fourth, and so on follow,  each supplied with honey and an egg and closed before the foundations  of the next are laid. Each task begun is continued until it is quite  finished; the Bee never commences a new cell until the four processes  needed for the construction of its predecessor are completed: the  building, the victualling, the laying of the egg and the closing of the  cell.    As the Mason-bee of the Walls always works by herself on the pebble  which she has chosen and even shows herself very jealous of her site  when her neighbours alight upon it, the number of cells set back to back  upon one pebble is not large, usually varying between six and ten.  Do some eight grubs represent the Bee's whole family? Or does she  afterwards go and establish a more numerous progeny on other boulders?  The surface of the same stone is spacious enough to provide a support  for further cells if the number of eggs called for them; the Bee could  build there very comfortably, without hunting for another site,  without leaving the pebble to which she is attached by habit and long  acquaintance. It seems to me therefore, exceedingly probable that the  family is a small one and that it is all installed on the one stone, at  any rate when the Mason-bee is building a new home.    The six to ten cells composing the cluster are certainly a solid  dwelling, with their rustic gravel covering; but the thickness of their  walls and lids, two millimetres (.078 inch--Translator's Note.) at most,  seems hardly sufficient to protect the grubs against the inclemencies  of the weather. Set on its pebble in the open air, without any sort of  shelter, the nest will have to undergo the heat of summer, which will  turn each cell into a stifling furnace, followed by the autumn rains,  which will slowly wear away the stonework, and by the winter frosts,  which will crumble what the rains have respected. However hard the  cement may be, can it possibly resist all these agents of destruction?  And, even if it does resist, will not the grubs, sheltered by too thin  a wall, have to suffer from excess of heat in summer and of cold in  winter?    Without arguing all this out, the Bee nevertheless acts wisely. When all  the cells are finished, she builds a thick cover over the group, formed  of a material, impermeable to water and a bad conductor of heat, which  acts as a protection at the same time against damp, heat and cold. This  material is the usual mortar, made of earth mixed with saliva, but on  this occasion with no small stones in it. The Bee applies it pellet  by pellet, trowelful by trowelful, to the depth of a centimetre (.39  inch--Translator's Note.) over the cluster of cells, which disappear  entirely under the clay covering. When this is done, the nest has the  shape of a rough dome, equal in size to half an orange. One would  take it for a round lump of mud which had been thrown and half crushed  against a stone and had then dried where it was. Nothing outside betrays  the contents, no semblance of cells, no semblance of work. To the  inexperienced eye, it is a chance splash of mud and nothing more.    This outer covering dries as quickly as do our hydraulic cements; and  the nest is now almost as hard as a stone. It takes a knife with a  strong blade to break open the edifice. And I would add, in conclusion,  that, under its final form, the nest in no way recalls the original  work, so much so that one would imagine the cells of the start, those  elegant turrets covered with stucco-work, and the dome of the finish,  looking like a mere lump of mud, to be the product of two different  species. But scrape away the crust of cement and we shall easily  recognize the cells below and their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#3)"],[1,"the upper windows could be heard.  Then  amidst the hush of men-folk, and the sounds of the life of the earth came  another sound that made all turn their eyes toward the door; and this was  the pad-pad of one running on the trodden and summer-dried ground anigh  the hall: it stopped for a moment at the Man's-door, and the door opened,  and the throng parted, making way for the man that entered and came  hastily up to the midst of the table that stood on the dais athwart the  hall, and stood there panting, holding forth in his outstretched hand  something which not all could see in the dimness of the hall-twilight,  but which all knew nevertheless.  The man was young, lithe and slender,  and had no raiment but linen breeches round his middle, and skin shoes on  his feet.  As he stood there gathering his breath for speech, Thiodolf  stood up, and poured mead into a drinking horn and held it out towards  the new-comer, and spake, but in rhyme and measure:       \"Welcome, thou evening-farer, and holy be thine head,     Since thou hast sought unto us in the heart of the Wolfings' stead;     Drink now of the horn of the mighty, and call a health if thou wilt     O'er the eddies of the mead-horn to the washing out of guilt.     For thou com'st to the peace of the Wolfings, and our very guest thou     art,     And meseems as I behold thee, that I look on a child of the Hart.\"    But the man put the horn from him with a hasty hand, and none said  another word to him until he had gotten his breath again; and then he  said:       \"All hail ye Wood-Wolfs' children! nought may I drink the wine,     For the mouth and the maw that I carry this eve are nought of mine;     And my feet are the feet of the people, since the word went forth that     tide,     'O Elf here of the Hartings, no longer shalt thou bide     In any house of the Markmen than to speak the word and wend,     Till all men know the tidings and thine errand hath an end.'     Behold, O Wolves, the token and say if it be true!     I bear the shaft of battle that is four-wise cloven through,     And its each end dipped in the blood-stream, both the iron and the     horn,     And its midmost scathed with the fire; and the word that I have borne     Along with this war-token is, 'Wolfings of the Mark     Whenso ye see the war-shaft, by the daylight or the dark,     Busk ye to battle faring, and leave all work undone     Save the gathering for the handplay at the rising of the sun.     Three days hence is the hosting, and thither bear along     Your wains and your kine for the slaughter lest the journey should be     long.     For great is the Folk, saith the tidings, that against the Markmen     come;     In a far off land is their dwelling, whenso they sit at home,     And Welsh {1} is their tongue, and we wot not of the word that is in     their mouth,     As they march a many together from the cities of the South.'\"    Therewith he held up yet for a minute the token of the war-arrow ragged  and burnt and bloody; and turning about with it in his hand went his ways  through the open door, none hindering; and when he was gone, it was as if  the token were still in the air there against the heads of the living  men, and the heads of the woven warriors, so intently had all gazed at  it; and none doubted the tidings or the token.  Then said Thiodolf:       \"Forth will we Wolfing children, and cast a sound abroad:     The mouth of the sea-beast's weapon shall speak the battle-word;     And ye warriors hearken and hasten, and dight the weed of war,     And then to acre and meadow wend ye adown no more,     For this work shall be for the women to drive our neat from the mead,     And to yoke the wains, and to load them as the men of war have need.\"    Out then they streamed from the hall, and no man was left therein save  the fair Hall-Sun sitting under the lamp whose name she bore.  But to the  highest of the slope they went, where was a mound made higher by man's  handiwork; thereon stood Thiodolf and handled the horn, turning his face  toward the downward course of Mirkwood-water; and he set the horn to his  lips, and blew a long blast, and then again, and yet again the third  time; and all the sounds of the gathering night were hushed under the  sound of the roaring of the war-horn of the Wolfings; and the Kin of the  Beamings heard it as they sat in their hall, and they gat them ready to  hearken to the bearer of the tidings who should follow on the sound of  the war-blast.    But when the last sound of the horn had died away, then said Thiodolf:       \"Now Wolfing children hearken, what the splintered War-shaft saith,     The fire scathed blood-stained aspen! we shall ride for life or death,     We warriors, a long journey with the herd and with the wain;     But unto this our homestead shall we wend us back again,     All the gleanings of the battle; and here for them that live     Shall stand the Roof of the Wolfings, and for them shall the meadow     thrive,     And the acres give their increase in the harvest of the year;     Now is no long departing since the Hall-Sun bideth here     'Neath the holy Roof of the Fathers, and the place of the Wolfing kin,     And the feast of our glad returning shall yet be held therein.     Hear the bidding of the War-shaft!  All men, both thralls and free,     'Twixt twenty winters and sixty, beneath the shield shall be,     And the hosting is at the Thing-stead, the Upper-mark anigh;     And we wend away to-morrow ere the Sun is noon-tide high.\"    Therewith he stepped down from the mound, and went his way back to the  hall; and manifold talk arose among the folk; and of the warriors some  were already dight for the journey, but most not, and a many went their  ways to see to their weapons and horses, and the rest back again into the  hall.    By this time night had fallen, and between then and the dawning would be  no darker hour, for the moon was just rising; a many of the horse-herds  had done their business, and were now making their way back again through  the lanes of the wheat, driving the stallions before them, who played  together kicking, biting and squealing, paying but little heed to the  standing corn on either side.  Lights began to glitter now in the cots of  the thralls, and brighter still in the stithies where already you might  hear the hammers clinking on the anvils, as men fell to looking to their  battle gear.    But the chief men and the women sat under their Roof on the eve of  departure: and the tuns of mead were broached, and the horns filled and  borne round by young maidens, and men ate and drank and were merry; and  from time to time as some one of the warriors had done with giving heed  to his weapons, he entered into the hall and fell into the company of  those whom he loved most and by whom he was best beloved; and whiles they  talked, and whiles they sang to the harp up and down that long house; and  the moon risen high shone in at the windows, and there was much laughter  and merriment, and talk of deeds of arms of the old days on the eve of  that departure: till little by little weariness fell on them, and they  went their ways to slumber, and the hall was fallen silent.          CHAPTER III--THIODOLF TALKETH WITH THE WOOD-SUN      But yet sat Thiodolf under the Hall-Sun for a while as one in deep  thought; till at last as he stirred, his sword clattered on him; and then  he lifted up his eyes and looked down the hall and saw no man stirring,  so he stood up and settled his raiment on him, and went forth, and so  took his ways through the hall-door, as one who hath an errand.    The moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without, and the dew was  falling in the coldest hour of the night, and the earth smelled sweetly:  the whole habitation was asleep now, and there was no sound to be known  as the sound of any creature, save that from the distant meadow came the  lowing of a cow that had lost her calf, and that a white owl was flitting  about near the eaves of the Roof with her wild cry that sounded like the  mocking of merriment now silent.    Thiodolf turned toward the wood, and walked steadily through the  scattered hazel-trees, and thereby into the thick of the beech-trees,  whose boles grew smooth and silver-grey, high and close-set: and so on  and on he went as one going by a well-known path, though there was no  path, till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the  beech-leaves, though yet for all the darkness, no man could go there and  not feel that the roof was green above him.  Still he went on in despite  of the darkness, till at last there was a glimmer before him, that grew  greater till he came unto a small wood-lawn whereon the turf grew again,  though the grass was but thin, because little sunlight got to it, so  close and thick were the tall trees round about it.  In the heavens above  it by now there was a light that was not all of the moon, though it might  scarce be told whether that light were the memory of yesterday or the  promise of to-morrow, since little of the heavens could be seen thence,  save the crown of them, because of the tall tree-tops.    Nought looked Thiodolf either at the heavens above, or the trees, as he  strode from off the husk-strewn floor of the beech wood on to the scanty  grass of the lawn, but his eyes looked straight before him at that which  was amidmost of the lawn: and little wonder was that; for there on a  stone chair sat a woman exceeding fair, clad in glittering raiment, her  hair lying as pale in the moonlight on the grey stone as the barley acres  in the August night before the reaping-hook goes in amongst them.  She  sat there as though she were awaiting someone, and he made no stop nor  stay, but went straight up to her, and took her in his arms, and kissed  her mouth and her eyes, and she him again; and then he sat himself down  beside her.  But her eyes looked kindly on him as she said:    \"O Thiodolf,"]]]
