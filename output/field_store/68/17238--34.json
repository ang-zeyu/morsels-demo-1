In perspective he was a master;  and in the refectory of the Franciscans, there is a picture of our Lord  amidst the apostles, exhibiting an architecture, which, however much  retouched, does not fail to produce great effect. In the pulpit of the same  church is also a S. Bernardino, with a S. Lodovico, one of his most  beautiful pieces; and elsewhere altar-grades, with figures which appear  like miniature. He had a brother of the name of Girolamo, of the order of  S. Domenico, also an excellent artist. The Last Supper, to be seen in the  grand library of S. Benedetto, copied from that of Leonardo, in Milan, is  from his hand. By many it is esteemed the best copy of that miracle of art,  which now remains to us. I have before treated of several of Andrea's  scholars, natives of Vicenza; and another of Cremona, I shall have to  mention in due time. Yet the entire series of this school will not be  completed with these names, as there are specimens of many unknown artists  executed in fresco, interspersed throughout different places in Mantua.  They are for the most part to be met with on the facades of buildings, and  in the churches; while in several of the galleries we may observe pictures  in oil, which appear to exhibit more of the defects than of the excellences  of a Mantegna.        MANTUAN SCHOOL.        EPOCH II.         _Giulio Romano and his School._      The school of the Mantegni becoming extinct in Mantua, another of a more  beautiful and distinguished character arose, sufficient to excite the envy  even of Rome. Duke Federigo had succeeded to Francesco, a prince of much  enlargement of mind, and so much devoted to the fine arts, that no artist  of common genius would have been equal to execute his ideas. Through the  interest of Baldassar Castiglione, then extremely intimate with Raffaello,  Giulio Romano was prevailed upon to visit Mantua, where he became at once  engineer and painter to Duke Frederic. The duties, however, of the first,  occupied him more than those of the second. For the city having been  damaged by the waters of the Mincio, the buildings being insecure or badly  planned, and the architecture inferior to the dignity of a capital, he was  thus furnished with sufficient materials on which to employ his talents,  and to render him as it were a new founder of Mantua; insomuch, that its  ruler, in a transport of gratitude, was heard to exclaim, that Giulio was  in truth more the master of the city than he himself. The whole of these  works are extensively recorded in different books of architecture. The duty  here required of me is to point out to the reader the originality of this  artist's character; a solitary instance perhaps in history, of one who,  having erected the most noble and beautiful palaces, villas, and temples,  painted and ornamented a considerable portion of them with his own hand;  while at the same time a regular school of his pupils and assistants was  formed in Mantua, which continued for a length of years to do equal honour  to the country and to the city of Lombardy.    We have already considered Giulio, in treating of the Roman School, in the  character of scholar, as well as heir and continuator of the works of  Raffaello; but here he is to appear in that of a master, pursuing the  method of the head of this school, both in teaching and composition. When  he came to Mantua he found abundance of ancient marbles, to which he  continued to add specimens, out of which the statues, the busts, and the  bassi-relievi, still preserved in the academy, are mere relics. To such  materials, collected by the Gonzaghi, he united some of his own. He was  abundantly furnished with designs, as well copied from the antique in Rome,  as executed by the hand of Raffaello. Nor were his own immediate studies  less valuable, no designer having better succeeded in uniting freedom of  invention with selection, rapidity with correctness, a knowledge of fable  and of history with a certain popular manner, and facility in treating  them. Upon the death of his master he began to give a freer scope to his  natural genius, which inclined rather to the bold than to the beautiful,  and induced him more to adopt the experience acquired by many years of  application, than his own knowledge of nature and of truth. He considered  it, therefore, mere amusement to adorn the palace of Mantua, and the great  suburban of the Te, (to say nothing of his numerous other works,) in the  style that Vasari relates, and which is, in part, to be seen at the present  day. So many chambers with gilded entablatures; such a variety of beautiful  stucco work, the figures of which have been removed for the instruction of  youth; so many stories and _capricci_ finely conceived and connected with  one another, besides such a diversity of labours adapted to different  places and subjects, altogether form a collection of wonders, the honour of  which Giulio divided with no other artist. For he himself conceived,  composed, and completed these vast undertakings.    He was accustomed himself to prepare the cartoons, and afterwards having  exacted from his pupils their completion, he went over the entire work with  his pencil, removed its defects, impressing at the same time upon the whole  the stamp of his own superior character. This method he acquired from  Raffaello; and he is commended by Vasari as the best artist known for his  production of distinguished pupils. It was the misfortune of Giulio to have  the touches of his own hand in his labours at the Te, modernized by other  pencils, owing to which the beautiful fable of Psyche, the moral  representations of human life, and his terrible war of the giants with  Jove, where he appeared to compete with Michelangiolo himself in the  hardihood of his design, still retain, indeed, the design and composition,  but no longer the colours of Giulio. In these last his hand will more truly  appear in his War of Troy, preserved at the royal court; in his history of  Lucretia; and in those little cabinets ornamented by him with grotesques  and other ingenious fancies. There we might sometimes pronounce him a  Homer, treating of arms, or sometimes an Anacreon, celebrating the delights  of wine and love. Nor did he employ his powers less nobly in sacred  subjects, more particularly for the dome, which, by commission of the  Cardinal Gonzaga, brother to Federigo, and guardian of his young nephew, he  not only built, but in part ornamented, though his death occurred before he  was enabled to complete his celebrated work. The paintings produced for  other churches by his own hand are not very numerous; such, consisting more  particularly of his Three Histories of the Passion, coloured in fresco, at  S. Marco; of his Santo Cristoforo, in the large altar of that church, in  which he is represented with an uncommon degree of strength, yet groaning  under the burden of the Lord of the Universe, who in the figure of an  infant is borne upon his shoulders; an incident originating in the name  itself of _Cristoforo_. But let us come to the school of Giulio, in Mantua.  It will not occupy many pages; since it did not mix the style of this  artist, as in other places has happened, with foreign styles, being  peculiarly true to its prototype, so that in each countenance we may trace,  as it were, his own exact features, although copied unequally.    In his Mantuan School there appeared several foreigners, among whom  Primaticcio proved the most celebrated; an artist whom Giulio employed to  work in stucco, and whom, on being invited into the service of the king of  France, he sent to that country in his stead. But we shall take no further  notice of him here, having to treat of him more fully in our account of the  Bolognese. The Veronese, who are in possession of a beautiful fresco, in  the Piazza delle Erbe, with the name of _Alberto Cavalli Savonese_, have  supposed this painter a scholar of Giulio, but without any other foundation  beyond a strong resemblance to the style of Pippi, in the naked parts. It  is strange that no other specimen of such a distinguished hand should be  known in Italy, nor any memorial of him, notwithstanding the great  researches that have been made; nor is it very improbable that he also may  have changed his country, and died in foreign parts. Benedetto Pagni from  Pescia had already tried his abilities in Rome, together with Bartolommeo  da Castiglioni, with Paparello da Cortona, and with Gio. da Leone; artists  of whom I know not if there exist any thing beyond the name; while Pagni,  who accompanied Giulio into Mantua, has been as highly esteemed by Vasari  as any other name. From his hand, besides what remains in his native place,  we possess a S. Lorenzo, painted in S. Andrea, at Mantua, which does credit  to such a school. Companion to him in the numerous works of the Te, we find  Rinaldo Mantovano, considered by Vasari the most celebrated painter of the  city, while he laments the untimely termination of his days. His  altar-piece of S. Agostino, at the Trinita, proves him to have been great  even in his youth, so much is the design beyond the expectation of such an  age; and it has by some been pronounced the work of his master. Fermo  Guisoni had a longer career; he painted in the cathedral the Vocation of S.  Pietro and S. Andrea, copied from one of the most beautiful and studied  cartoons of Giulio. Other pieces of his are extant, in part designed by  Bertani, and in part from his own hand. Such is a picture of the  Crucifixion at S. Andrea, which both in point of design and force of  colouring is indeed admirable.    In this series Vasari has omitted to mention several others whom the  Mantuans have enumerated as belonging to the school of Giulio, and as  natives of their country. Among these is a Teodoro Ghigi, a Mantuan, as he  subscribes himself, an excellent designer, and so familiar with the manner  of the leader of his"]]]
