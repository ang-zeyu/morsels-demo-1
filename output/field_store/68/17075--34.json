II      WHY MEN DON'T MARRY      'If you wish the pick of mankind, take a good bachelor and a good    wife.'      'There is probably no other act in a man's life so hot-headed and    foolish as this of marriage.' --R. L. STEVENSON.      'Whatever may be said against marriage, it is certainly an    experience.' --OSCAR WILDE.      'All the men are getting married and none of the girls,' a volatile lady  is once reported to have said, and one understands what she meant to  convey. In a newspaper correspondence on marriage I once noted the  following significant passage: '_But in these days it is different from  what it was when I was a girl. Then every boy had his sweetheart and  every girl her chap. Now it seems to me the boys don't want sweethearts  and the girls can't get chaps. For one youth who means honestly to marry  a girl, you will find twenty whose game is mere flirtation, regardless  of how the girl may be injured. The times are ungallant and they want  mending._'    This letter is signed 'A Workman's Wife,' but it bears ample evidence of  having been written by a member of the staff, who seemed to consider  sufficient _vraisemblance_ had been given to the signature by the  inclusion of an occasional vulgarism, such as 'chap.' But in spite of  being penned to order, the statements expressed appear to be only too  true. The times are ungallant indeed and growing more so every year.    Not long ago I was at a cheery social gathering where the non-marrying  tendency of modern men was being discussed. Someone put all the men into  a good humour with the reminder that 'by persistently remaining single,  a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation,' and as there  were fifteen bachelors present, the conversation naturally became  personal.    One whom I will call Vivian, gallantly remarked that all the nice women  were married, so he perforce remained single. I happen to know that he  is deeply in love with a married woman. Another, Lucian, a very handsome  and popular man of thirty, said he fully meant to marry some day, but  wanted a few more years' freedom first. Dorian gravely asserted that he  was waiting for my daughter (aged eighteen months), but being in his  confidence, I know that his case is similar to Vivian's. Hadrian's  health would make his marriage a crime; we are all aware of that  fortunately, so no one asked him. The same discretion was observed with  regard to Julien of whom it is well known that he has formed an  'unfortunate' attachment and has practically not the right to marry.  Florian was jilted years ago, and is shy and distrustful of the sex,  which is a great pity, as he is the kind of man born for fireside and  nursery joys, and would make a wife very happy.    Of Augustin and Fabian it may be truly said that 'the more they have  known of the others, the less they will settle to one;' and indeed I  fear they have spoilt themselves for matrimony, unless there is truth in  the old saying that a reformed rake makes the best husband. Endymion is  altogether too ineligible, his blue eyes and broad shoulders being his  only fortune; he makes plenty of capital out of these adjuncts: they  bring him in a rich return of feminine favour, but are nevertheless  hardly sufficient to support a wife.    Claudian is really anxious to marry, but suffers from a fatal  faithlessness and, as he engagingly explains, can't love a girl long  enough to get the preliminaries settled. One day he is sure to be caught  by some determined and probably very unsuitable woman and led reluctant  to the altar. Galahad won't marry until he has found 'the one woman,'  and I fear he will prove a husband wasted, for poor Galahad already  wears spectacles and a bald spot; his devotion to an unrealisable ideal  bids fair to spoil his life.    When I put the question to Aurelian, he smiled his evil smile, which  makes him more like an embittered vulture than ever, and remarked that  he was thinking over his offers and hadn't yet decided which was the  best. As the fact that he has been refused by seven women is well-known,  we really rather admire the persistence of his pose as a lady-killer.  He has even been known to write passionate letters to himself, in an  assumed hand, and drop cleverly-manufactured tears here and there upon  them, to give an air of greater realism to these amorous masterpieces,  which he uses as a proof of his wild stories of conquest. When dry, the  tears look most life-like; of course it is a dodge that every schoolgirl  knows, but I have never known a man have recourse to it before, and hope  never to again!    Both Cyprian and Valerian gave as the reason for their continued  bachelorhood, the fact that they were too comfortable as bachelors and  had never felt the need of a wife. The latter added that if he could  find just _the_ girl, he would think it over, but as matters stood he  preferred certainty to chance and was taking no risks. Between  ourselves, both these two are very self-satisfied and egotistical  persons, and I don't think any woman has lost much by their resolve.    The fourteenth man was Bayard, who belongs to a very exasperating type  of philanderer. Most women of the world have met and been bored by him  to their sorrow. It is his grievous habit to go about professing a  yearning for matrimony of the most ideal kind, and confiding at great  length to safely attached young matrons how he longs to find a home in  one good woman's heart, and what a great, pure, passionate, wild love he  is capable of. There is something rather engaging about him, and his  pose is naturally very attractive to unsuspecting spinsters. He is  always getting desperately entangled, but makes a great parade of his  poverty when the _affaire_ reaches the critical point, and wriggles out  successfully--generally without any too unpleasant explanation. If,  however, things have gone too far for this, he can always make good his  escape under cover of the 'I love you too much, darling, to drag you  down to poverty' plea. How many girls, wounded to the heart's core, have  listened to this hoary lie when they are more than willing to be poor,  if but with him, willing to economise and save, and forego for his sake.    Not, of course, that Bayard and his like inspire such devotion; I mean  that the essentials of this particular excuse are given by very many  unmarried men nowadays as the reason of their single state. Generally  speaking, there are two main reasons why men do not marry: 1. Because  they have not yet met a woman they care for sufficiently; 2.--and these  constitute a large majority--because they are too selfish. Of course men  don't spell it that way. Like Bayard, they say they 'can't afford it.'  They think of all the things they would have to give up--how difficult  it is to get enough for their pleasure now, how impossible it would be  then, with the support of a wife and potential family added; how they  would hate having to knock off poker, find a cheaper tailor, and  economise in golf balls. They shudder at the prospect, and decide in the  expressively vulgar parlance of the day that it's 'not good enough.' The  things that are beyond price are weighed against the things that are  bought with money--and found wanting!    It would, however, be the last word of foolishness to encourage  improvident marriages, already a source of so much misery, and of course  my remarks do not apply to the genuine poverty of the man who really  cannot afford to wed. For him I have a very real sympathy, since he is  missing the best things of life probably through no fault of his own.  The above strictures are intended solely for the man of moderate means,  who could afford to marry if he loved himself less and some woman more.  Five hundred a year, for instance, is a comfortable income for a  bachelor not in the inner circle of Society. On this sum a middle-class  man can do himself well, provided he has no particularly expensive vices  or hobbies--but it certainly means self-denial when stretched to provide  for a wife and two or three children. It means a small house in one of  the cheaper suburbs, instead of a bachelor flat in town, 'buses instead  of cabs, upper boxes instead of stalls, a fortnight _en famille_ at  Broadstairs instead of a month's fishing _en garcon_ in Norway. It means  no more suppers at the Savoy, no more week-ends in Paris, no more  'running' over to Monte Carlo; but it _can_ be done, and done happily,  provided a man puts love above luxuries. Almost every man can afford to  marry--the right woman!    Of course, if a man has still to meet the woman of his fancy, all is  well, but it is the despicable plea of Bayard that so incenses me. If  men would own the truth, it would not be so bad, but, Adam-like, as  usual, they lay the blame on women and say: 'Girls expect so much  nowadays, it is impossible to make enough money to satisfy them.' This  is one of the many lies men tell about women, or perhaps they are under  a delusion and really believe the statement to be true. Let them be  undeceived, girls _don't_ expect so much; they are perfectly willing to  be poor, as I have said before, if only they care for the man enough. At  anyrate, once they have reached that stage of wanting the real things of  life they would sooner have wifehood and comparative poverty than ease  and empty hearts in their parents' home. They would sooner, in short,  be 'tired wives than restful spinsters.'    Another delusion men spread about women is that they're too fond of  pleasure to settle down.

HELPFUL CULINARY HINTS      On Methods of Cooking    Water _boiling_ slowly has the same temperature as when boiling rapidly,  and will do just the same amount of work; there is, therefore, no object  in wasting fuel to keep water boiling violently.    _Stewing_ is the most economical method of cooking the cheaper and  tougher cuts of meats, fowl, etc. This method consists in cooking the  food a long time in sufficient water to cover it--at a temperature  slightly below the boiling point.    _Braising._ In this method of cooking, drippings or fat salt pork are  melted or tried out in the kettle and a bed of mixed vegetables, fine  herbs and seasoning placed therein. The article being cooked is placed  on this bed of vegetables, moisture is added and the meat cooked until  tender at a low temperature. The last half hour of cooking the cover is  removed, so that the meat may brown richly.    In _broiling_ and _grilling_, the object is first to sear the surface  over as quickly as possible, to retain the rich juices, then turn  constantly until the food is richly browned. _Pan-broiling_ is cooking  the article in a greased, hissing-hot, cast-iron skillet, turning often  and drawing off the fat as it dries out.    _Sauteing_ is practically the same as pan-broiling, except that the fat  is allowed to remain in the skillet. The article is cooked in a small  amount of fat, browning the food on one side and then turning and  browning on the other side.    _Frying._ While this term is sometimes used in the sense of sauteing it  usually consists of cooking by means of immersion in deep, hot fat. When  frying meats or fish it is best to keep them in a warm room a short time  before cooking, then wipe dry as possible. As soon as the food has  finished frying, it should be carefully removed from the fat and drained  on brown paper.      Egging and Crumbing Food    Use for this dry bread crumbs, grated and sifted, crackers rolled and  sifted, or soft stale bread broken in pieces and gently rubbed through  croquette basket; the eggs should be broken into a shallow plate and  slightly beaten with a fork to mix the white thoroughly. Dilute the eggs  in the proportion of two tablespoons cold milk or water to every egg.  The crumbs should be dusted on the board; the food to be fried should be  lightly crumbed all over, then dipped into egg so as to cover the  article entirely, then rolled again in bread crumbs. Sometimes, as in  cooking fish, flour is used for the first coating in place of the  crumbs, the article being then dipped into the egg mixture, then with  crumbs and then fried.      Larding    Consists of introducing small strips of fat, salt pork or bacon through  uncooked meat. To lard, introduce one end of the lardoon (the small  strip of fat) into a larding needle and with the pointed end take up a  stitch one-half inch deep and one-half inch wide. Draw the needle  through carefully so that the ends of the lardoon may project evenly  over the surface of the meat. Oftentimes, however, thin slices of fat,  salt pork or bacon are placed over the meat as a substitute for larding,  although it does not give quite the same delicious flavor or look so  attractive.      Marinating    Consists of adding a pickle, composed of vinegar and oil, to the  ingredients of some combination used in salad making.      Cleaning Cooking Utensils    For washing dishes and cleaning pots and pans use a solution made by  dissolving a teaspoonful or so of Gold Dust Washing Powder in a dish-pan  full of water. If the cooking utensils have become charred or stained in  cooking, sprinkle some Polly Prim Cleaner on a damp cloth and rub  utensil thoroughly. After scouring, rinse the article well in hot water,  and wipe dry. Use Polly Prim Cleaner also, for cleaning cutlery and for  keeping the refrigerator clean and sweet.          _January_              _Hail! hail! the New Year, ring the bells             Till music echoes o'er the dells,             Play merry tunes, sing merry songs,             For joy to this New Year belongs._                                        --_Raymond._    [Illustration]    EDITOR'S NOTE:    _This menu--the first of the year--has been prepared rather more  elaborately than the customary Sunday menus, with the thought that it  might serve also as suggestion for a New Year's Dinner._    [Sidenote: _January_    _First"]]]
