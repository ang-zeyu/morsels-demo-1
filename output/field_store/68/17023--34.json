Such incidents must, from their nature, have been infrequent, but they  show to what straits some at least were reduced. Six years after the  war, James S. Pike, then in South Carolina, mentions cases which might  be duplicated in nearly every old Southern community: \"In the vicinity,\"  he says, \"lived a gentleman whose income when the war broke out was  rated at $150,000 a year. Not a vestige of his whole vast estate remains  today. Not far distant were the estates of a large proprietor and a  well-known family, rich and distinguished for generations. The slaves  were gone. The family is gone. A single scion of the house remains, and  he peddles tea by the pound and molasses by the quart, on a corner of  the old homestead, to the former slaves of the family and thereby earns  his livelihood.\"    General Lee's good example influenced many. Commercial enterprises were  willing to pay for the use of his name and reputation, but he wished  to farm and could get no opportunity. \"They are offering my father  everything,\" his daughter said, \"except the only thing he will accept,  a place to earn honest bread while engaged in some useful work.\" This  remark led to an offer of the presidency of Washington College, now  Washington and Lee University, which he accepted. \"I have a self-imposed  task which I must accomplish,\" he said, \"I have led the young men of  the South in battle; I have seen many of them fall under my standard.  I shall devote my life now to training young men to do their duty in  life.\"    The condition of honest folk was still further troubled by a general  spirit of lawlessness in many regions. Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas,  and Louisiana recognized the \"Union\" state government, but the coming of  peace brought legal anarchy to the other states of the Confederacy. The  Confederate state and local governments were abolished as the armies of  occupation spread over the South, and for a period of four or six months  there was no government except that exercised by the commanders of the  military garrisons left behind when the armies marched away. Even before  the surrender, the local governments were unable to make their authority  respected, and soon after the war ended, parts of the country became  infested with outlaws, pretend treasury agents, horse thieves, cattle  thieves, and deserters. Away from the military posts only lynch law  could cope with these elements of disorder.    With the aid of the army in the more settled regions, and by extra-legal  means elsewhere, the outlaws, thieves, cotton burners, and house burners  were brought somewhat under control even before the state governments  were reorganized, though the embers of lawlessness continued to smolder.    The relations between the Federal soldiers stationed in the principal  towns and the native white population were not, on the whole, so bad as  might have been expected. If the commanding officer were well disposed,  there was little danger of friction, though sometimes his troops got out  of hand. The regulars had a better reputation than the volunteers.  The Confederate soldiers were surfeited with fighting, but the  \"stay-at-home\" element was often a cause of trouble. The problem  of social relations between the conquerors and the conquered was  troublesome. The men might get along well together, but the women would  have nothing do with the \"Yankees,\" and ill feeling arose because of  their antipathy. Carl Schurz reported that \"the soldier of the Union is  looked upon as a stranger, an intruder, as the 'Yankee,' the 'enemy.'...  The existence and intensity of this aversion is too well known to those  who have served or are serving in the South to require proof.\"    In retaliation the soldiers developed ingenious ways of annoying the  whites. Women, forced for any reason to go to headquarters, were made to  take the oath of allegiance or the \"ironclad\" oath before their requests  were granted; flags were fastened over doors, gates, or sidewalks  in order to irritate the recalcitrant dames and their daughters.  Confederate songs and color combinations were forbidden. In Richmond,  General Halleck ordered that no marriages be performed unless the bride,  the groom, and the officiating clergyman took the oath of allegiance.  He explained this as a measure taken to prevent \"the propagation of  legitimate rebels.\"    The wearing of Confederate uniforms was forbidden by military order, but  by May 1865, few soldiers possessed regulation uniforms. In Tennessee  the State also imposed fines upon *wear wearers of the uniform. In  the vicinity of military posts, buttons and marks of rank were usually  ordered removed and the gray clothes dyed with some other color. General  Lee, for example, had the buttons on his coat covered with cloth. But  frequently the Federal commander, after issuing the orders, paid no more  attention to the matter and such conflicts as arose on account of the  uniform were usually caused by officious enlisted men and the Negro  troops. Whitelaw Reid relates the following incident:    \"Nothing was more touching, in all that I saw in Savannah, than the  almost painful effort of the rebels, from generals down to privates,  to conduct themselves so as to evince respect for our soldiers, and to  bring no severer punishment upon the city than it had already received.  There was a brutal scene at the hotel, where a drunken sergeant, with  a pair of tailor's shears, insisted on cutting the buttons from the  uniform of an elegant gray-headed old brigadier, who had just come in  from Johnston's army; but he bore himself modestly and very handsomely  through it. His staff was composed of fine-looking, stalwart fellows,  evidently gentlemen, who appeared intensely mortified at such treatment.  They had no clothes except their rebel uniforms, and had, as yet, had no  time to procure others, but they avoided disturbances and submitted to  what they might, with some propriety, and with the general approval of  our officers, have resented.\"    The Negro troops, even at their best, were everywhere considered  offensive by the native whites. General Grant, indeed, urged that only  white troops be used to garrison the interior. But the Negro soldier,  impudent by reason of his new freedom, his new uniform, and his new gun,  was more than Southern temper could tranquilly bear, and race conflicts  were frequent. A New Orleans newspaper thus states the Southern point  of view: \"Our citizens who had been accustomed to meet and treat the  Negroes only as respectful servants, were mortified, pained, and shocked  to encounter them... wearing Federal uniforms and bearing bright muskets  and gleaming bayonets.... They are jostled from the sidewalks by dusky  guards, marching four abreast. They were halted, in rude and sullen  tones, by Negro sentinels.\"    The task of the Federal forces was not easy. The garrisons were not  large enough nor numerous enough to keep order in the absence of civil  government. The commanders in the South asked in vain for cavalry  to police the rural districts. Much of the disorder, violence, and  incendiarism attributed at the time to lawless soldiers appeared later  to be due to discharged soldiers and others pretending to be soldiers in  order to carry out schemes of robbery. The whites complained vigorously  of the garrisons, and petitions were sent to Washington from mass  meetings and from state legislatures asking for their removal. The  higher commanders, however, bore themselves well, and in a few fortunate  cases Southern whites were on most amicable terms with the garrison  commanders. The correspondence of responsible military officers in the  South shows how earnestly and considerately each, as a rule, tried  to work out his task. The good sense of most of the Federal officers  appeared when, after the murder of Lincoln, even General Grant for  a brief space lost his head and ordered the arrest of paroled  Confederates.      The church organizations were as much involved in the war and in the  reconstruction as were secular institutions. Before the war every  religious organization having members North and South, except the  Catholic Church and the Jews, had separated into independent Northern  and Southern bodies. In each section church feeling ran high, and when  the war came, the churches supported the armies. As the Federal armies  occupied Southern territory, the church buildings of each denomination  were turned over to the corresponding Northern body, and Southern  ministers were permitted to remain only upon agreeing to conduct \"loyal  services, pray for the President of the United States and for Federal  victories\" and to foster \"loyal sentiment.\" The Protestant Episcopal  churches in Alabama were closed from September to December 1865, and  some congregations were dispersed by the soldiers because Bishop Wilmer  had directed his clergy to omit the prayer for President Davis but had  substituted no other. The ministers of non-liturgical churches were not  so easily controlled. A Georgia Methodist preacher directed by a Federal  officer to pray for the President said afterwards: \"I prayed for the  President that the Lord would take out of him and his allies the hearts  of beasts and put into them the hearts of men or remove the cusses from  office.\" Sometimes members of a congregation showed their resentment  at the \"loyal\" prayers by leaving the church. But in spite of many  irritations, both sides frequently managed to get some amusement out  of the \"loyal\" services. The church situation was, however, a serious  matter during and after the reconstruction, and some of its later phases  will have to be discussed elsewhere.    The Unionist, or \"Tory,\" of the lower and eastern South found himself,  in 1865, a man without a country. Few in number in any community, they  found themselves, upon their return"]]]
