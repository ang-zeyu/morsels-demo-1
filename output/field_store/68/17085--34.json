Sometimes it seems very distasteful to us that the sex or generative  organs should be placed so near to what we might call our \"sewerage  system.\" We do not like to have to connect in our thought anything so  sweet and nice as a baby or so happy and precious as the sex embrace  with the waste of our bodies, which we want to be rid of with as  little thought as possible, as it is disagreeable at best, and we  wonder why we were created this way. But we have to remember that the  sex organs are very delicate and they are probably placed where they  can best be protected from injury. It would be hard to think of any  other part of the body that would be safer than just this place. At  any rate there they are, and our duty is to understand them as best  we can, and take mighty good care of them as our most wonderful  possession.    Looking at Plate I, you will see that the woman's body provides the  egg or ovum. These grow, many thousands of them, in two small sacs  called ovaries, and every little while (usually every four weeks, but  not always) an ovum ripens and passes out from the ovary through the  fallopian tube (there are two of these, one leading from each ovary)  into the uterus or womb, a process which takes several days. Here it  may be met by the male life element, and if so, it becomes fertilized  and remains in the uterus to grow into a baby. This is called  fertilization, fecundation, impregnation or conception. But if the  egg is not fertilized, it passes from the uterus through the vagina  and out of the body. The ovaries take turns in developing the ovum.    Every twenty-eight days or so a woman, from the time she is about  thirteen or fourteen till she is about fifty, has a slight flow of  blood from the uterus, which is called menstruation. The reasons for  this are not wholly understood, but it is supposed there is an extra  supply of blood provided periodically for the growth of a baby, but  when there is no baby starting to grow, the blood is not needed so it  flows away (about once in four weeks). Often the unfertilized ovum is  carried away with it, but the two things do not necessarily happen at  the same time. Menstruation lasts from three to five days and young  girls sometimes have pain then and feel languid and \"unwell.\" If so  they should be quieter than usual and avoid cold baths and getting  their feet wet. But menstruation is not an illness, and a girl in  perfect health finds it only a slight inconvenience.    The ovaries not only produce the egg, but they also produce a  secretion that is absorbed by the blood and which is most necessary  in the development of a girl into a woman. It has an almost magical  effect in adding the specially womanly qualities to the body and  character.    Looking at Plate 2, you will see the man's sex machinery. The  testicles are to a man what the ovaries are to a woman. They are two  sacs held in a bag of rather thin loose skin called the scrotum, and  it is here that the sperm (spermatozoa) or germ of life grows. Just  how no one really knows. The spermatozoa are very tiny and the  testicles hold many thousands of them. Under the microscope they show  a sort of head and tail like a pollywog. They are very much alive and  move by a rapid wiggling of the tail part.    Leading from each testicle is a tube called the vas deferens, through  which the sperm goes at the time of the sex act on its way out to  meet the ovum in the woman's body. On the way it is joined by two  other liquids, one secreted by the seminal vesicles (of which there  are two) and the other by the prostate gland. These three liquids  together form the semen, which at the times of sexual excitement is  forced out through the penis into the vagina of the woman.    You will notice that the woman has separate tubes for the urine  (waste water) and the sex function, but the man uses the same tube  for both: that is, in the woman the bladder which holds the urine is  emptied by a separate tube, the urethra, while in the man the urethra  not only empties the bladder, but it also carries the semen.    The use of the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland is to supply a  means of nourishment for the spermatozoa until they reach the ovum,  which may not be for several days after the semen is expelled into  the vagina.    Then there are two small glands called Cowper's glands, which make  the passage in the penis alkaline, as the spermatozoa can only remain  alive in an alkaline secretion and the urine is acid, so always just  before the penis forces out the semen, the secretion from Cowper's  glands goes ahead to protect the sperm from being destroyed by any  remaining traces of the acid urine.    At the end of the penis is a fold or cap of skin, the prepuce, which  the doctor often removes for the sake of the boy's health, a process  called circumcision, and it is a great relief to boys whose prepuce  or foreskin is too tight as to make difficulty in keeping clean. All  Jewish babies are regularly circumcised, a custom dating way back to  Bible times.    There is a constant internal secretion from the testicles of a man  just as from the ovaries of a woman, and it has the same beneficial  effect on the whole being. It makes a boy what we call manly or  virile. The value of the internal secretions of the sex organs in  both boys and girls is so great that for that reason, if for no  other, the whole sex machinery must be kept in perfect health.    Boys have a certain discomfort to bear which is difficult for them  just as menstruation is difficult for girls. But by knowing the  meaning of things and by taking care of themselves, they need not be  seriously troubled by it. Every once in a while as they are growing  up, but before they are old enough to really fall in love and marry  and have children, boys feel a sort of stirring of the sex  organs--sometimes so much so that it makes them quite uneasy and  anxious for relief. The thing to do is to keep as calm as possible  and keep very busy and very healthy. Then the discomfort will not be  too great, and nature will usually bring relief by letting the  accumulated semen pass off during sleep. This is called a seminal  emission, and is perfectly harmless. Sometimes a vivid sexual dream  comes with it, but that too will do no harm, unless a boy lets his  mind dwell on it till the excitement grows unnatural. This emission  may happen every two weeks or so, but it is not a regular thing. Boys  are sometimes alarmed and fear their sex machinery is out of order,  but it is a perfectly natural thing, and only means that the organs  are relieving themselves of the extra secretions that are not needed  till the time comes for the real sex relation.    Boys and girls sometimes get the habit of handling their sex organs  so as to get them excited. This is called masturbation or self-abuse.  It is also called auto-erotism. Such handling can be made to result  in a climax something like that of the natural sex act. For  generations this habit has been considered wrong and dangerous, but  recently many of the best scientists have concluded that the chief  harm has come from the worry caused by doing it, when one believed it  to be wrong. This worry has often been so great that real illness,  both of the mind and body has resulted. There is no occasion for  worry unless the habit is carried to excess. But remember that until  you are mature, the sex secretions are specially needed within your  body, and if you use them wastefully before you are grown, you are  depriving your body of what it needs. So do not stimulate your sex  organs into action _intentionally_. And do not yield to the impulse  to handle the sex organs in order to relieve the pressure which may  occasionally feel overwhelming, unless you find that nature does not  bring you relief during sleep.    Remember always that your whole sex machinery is more easily put out  of order than any other part of your body, and it must be treated  with great care and respect all along. It is not fair to ourselves or  to each other to do a single thing that will make us either weak or  unnatural. Remember that your sex organs have a very powerful, even  if invisible, effect upon your whole being, and up to the time that  you are really old enough to love some one to whom you want to  actually belong, you must _let your sex machinery_ grow strong and  ready for its good, happy work when the right time comes. The sex  organs during your youth do not need frequent exercise in the same  sense that your muscles do. They are active all the time with their  internal secretions which strengthen both you and them.    Don't ever let any one drag you into nasty talk or thought about sex.
