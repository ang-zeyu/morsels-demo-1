[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#3)"],[1," let us say,  whenever the stigma is in one of the three positions, the  different sets of stamens occupy the other two. In a long series  of experiments on flowers occurring in two and three forms -  dimorphic and trimorphic - Darwin proved that perfect fertility  can be obtained only when the stigma in each form is pollenized  with grains carried from the stamens of a corresponding height.  For example, a bee on entering the flower must get his abdomen  dusted with pollen from the long stamens, his chest covered from  the middle-length stamens, and his tongue and chin from the set  in the bottom of the tube nearest the nectary. When he flies off  to visit another flower, these parts of his body coming in  contact with the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where  the stamens were in other individuals, he necessarily brushes off  each lot of pollen just where it will do the most good. Pollen  brought from high stamens, for example, to a low stigma, even  should it reach it, which is scarcely likely, takes little or no  effect. Thus cross-fertilization is absolutely essential, and in  three-formed flowers there are two chances to one of securing it.      WILD HYACINTH, SCILLA or SQUILL. QUAMASH    (Quamasia kyacinthina; Scilla Fraseri of Gray) Lily family    Flowers - Several or many, pale violet blue, or rarely white, in  a long, loose raceme; perianth of 6 equal, narrowly oblong,  widely spreading divisions, the thread-like filaments inserted at  their bases; style thread-like, with 3-lobed stigma. Scape: 1 to  2 ft. high, from egg-shaped, nearly black bulb, 1 to 1 1/2 in.  long. Leaves: Grass-like, shorter than flowering scape, from the  base. Fruit: A 3-angled, oval capsule containing shining black  seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Meadows, prairies, and along banks of  streams.  Flowering Season - April-May.  Distribution - Pennsylvania and Ohio westward to Minnesota, south  to Alabama and Texas.    Coming with the crocuses, before the snow is off the ground, and  remaining long after their regal gold and purple chalices have  withered, the Siberian scillas sold by seedsmen here deserve a  place in every garden, for their porcelain-blue color is rare as  it is charming; the early date when they bloom makes them  especially welcome; and, once planted and left undisturbed, the  bulbs increase rapidly, without injury from overcrowding.  Evidently they need little encouragement to run wild.  Nevertheless they are not wild scillas, however commonly they may  be miscalled so. Certainly ladies' tresses, known as wild  hyacinth in parts of New England, has even less right to the  name.    Our true native wild hyacinth, or scilla, is quite a different  flower, not so pure a blue as the Siberian scilla, and paler; yet  in the middle West, where it abounds, there are few lovelier  sights in spring than a colony of these blossoms directed  obliquely upward from slender, swaying scapes among the lush  grass. Their upward slant brings the stigma in immediate contact  with an incoming visitor's pollen-laden body. As the stamens  diverge with the spreading of the divisions of the perianth, to  which they are attached, the stigma receives pollen brought from  another flower, before the visitor dusts himself anew in  searching for refreshment, thus effecting cross-pollination.  Ants, bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, and beetles may be seen  about the wild hyacinth, which is obviously best adapted to the  bees. The smallest insects that visit it may possibly defeat  Nature's plan and obtain nectar without fertilizing the flower,  owing to the wide passage between stamens and stigma. In about an  hour, one May morning, Professor Charles Robertson captured over  six hundred insects, representing thirty-eight distinct species,  on a patch of wild hyacinths in Illinois.    The bulb of a MEDITERRANEAN SCILLA (S. maritima) furnishes the  sourish-sweet syrup of squills used in medicine for bronchial  troubles.      The GRAPE HYACINTH (Muscari botrycides), also known as Baby's  Breath, because of its delicate faint fragrance, escapes from  gardens at slight encouragement to grow wild in the roadsides and  meadows from Massachusetts to Virginia and westward to Ohio. Its  tiny, deep-blue, globular flowers, stiffly set around a fleshy  scape that rises between erect, blade-like, channeled leaves,  appear spring after spring wherever the small bulbs have been  planted. On the east end of Long Island there are certain meadows  literally blued with the little runaways.      PURPLE TRILLIUM, ILL-SCENTED WAKE-ROBIN or BIRTH-ROOT    (Trillium erectum)  Lily-of-the-Valley family    Flowers - Solitary, dark, dull purple, or purplish red; rarely  greenish, white, or pinkish; on erect or slightly inclined  footstalk. Calyx of 3 spreading sepals, 1 to 1 1/2 in. long, or  about length of 3 pointed, oval petals; stamens 6; anthers longer  than filaments; pistil spreading into 3 short, recurved stigmas.  Stem: Stout, 8 to i6 in. high, from tuber-like rootstock. Leaves:  In a whorl of 3; broadly ovate, abruptly pointed, netted-veined.  Fruit: A 6-angled, ovate, reddish berry.  Preferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.  Flowering Season - April-June.  Distribution - Nova Scotia westward to Manitoba, southward to  North Carolina and Missouri.    Some weeks after the jubilant, alert robins have returned from  the South, the purple trillium unfurls its unattractive,  carrion-scented flower. In the variable colors found in different  regions, one can almost trace its evolution from green, white,  and red to purple, which, we are told, is the course all flowers  must follow to attain to blue. The white and pink forms, however  attractive to the eye, are never more agreeable to the nose than  the reddish-purple ones. Bees and butterflies, with delicate  appreciation of color and fragrance, let the blossom alone, since  it secretes no nectar; and one would naturally infer either that  it can fertilize itself without insect aid - a theory which  closer study of its organs goes far to disprove - or that the  carrion-scent, so repellent to us, is in itself an attraction to  certain insects needful for cross-pollination. Which are they?  Beetles have been observed crawling over the flower, but without  effecting any methodical result. One inclines to accept Mr.  Clarence M. Weed's theory of special adaptation to the common  green flesh-flies (Lucilia carnicina), which would naturally be  attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a raw  beefsteak of uncertain age. These little creatures, seen in every  butcher shop throughout the summer, the flower furnishes with a  free lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a  few grains to another blossom. Absence of the usual floral  attractions gives, the carrion flies a practical monopoly of the  pollen food, which no doubt tastes as it smells.    The SESSILE-FLOWERED WAKE-ROBIN (T. sessile), whose dark purple,  purplish-red, or greenish blossom, narrower of sepal and petals  than the preceding, is seated in a whorl of three egg-shaped,  sometimes blotched, leaves, possesses a rather pleasant odor;  nevertheless it seems. to have no great attraction for insects.  The stigmas, which are very large, almost touch the anthers  surrounding them; therefore the beetles which one frequently sees  crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar them, no doubt,  as to self-fertilize the flower; but it is scarcely probable  these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom to  another. A degraded flower like this has little need of color and  perfume, one would suppose; yet it may be even now slowly  perfecting its way toward an ideal of which we see a part only  complete. In deep, rich, moist woods and thickets the. sessile  trillium blooms in April or May, from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and  Minnesota southward nearly to the Gulf.      LARGER BLUE FLAG; BLUE IRIS; FLEUR-DE-LIS; FLOWER-DE-LUCE    (Iris versicolor)  Iris family    Flowers - Several, 2 to 3 in. long, violet-blue variegated with  yellow, green, or white, and purple veined. Six divisions of the  perianth: 3 outer ones spreading, recurved; 1 of them bearded,  much longer and wider than the 3 erect inner divisions; all  united into a short tube. Three stamens under 3 overhanging  petal-like divisions of the style, notched at end; under each  notch is a thin plate, smooth on one side, rough and moist  (stigma) on side turned away from anther. Stem: 2 to 3 ft. high,  stout, straight, almost circular, sometimes branching above.  Leaves: Erect, sword-shaped, shorter than stem, somewhat hoary,  from 1/2 to 1 in. wide, folded, and in a compact flat cluster at  base; bracts usually longer than stem of flower. Fruit: Oblong  capsule, not prominently 3-lobed, and with 2 rows of round, flat  seeds closely packed in each cell. Rootstock: Creeping,  horizontal, fleshy.  Preferred Habitat - Marshes, wet meadows.  Flowering Season - May-July.  Distribution - Newfoundland and Manitoba to Arkansas and Florida.    \"The fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry,\" says Ruskin,  \"has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart.\" When that  young and pious Crusader, Louis VII, adopted it for the emblem of  his house, spelling was scarcely an exact science, and the  fleur-de-Louis soon became corrupted into its present form.  Doubtless the royal flower was the white iris, and as li is the  Celtic for white, there is room for another theory as to the  origin of the name. It is our far more regal looking, but truly  democratic blossom, jostling its fellows in the marshes, that is  indeed \"born in the purple.\"    When Napoleon wished to pose as the true successor of those  ancient French kings whose territory included the half of Europe  - ignoring every Louis who ever sat on the throne, for their very  name and emblem had become odious to the people - he discarded  the fleur-de-lis, to replace it with golden bees, the symbol in  armory for industry and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30047"],[0,"Aircraft and Submarines (#3)"],[1,"more unbelievable than the story of  an army saved by a handful of men flying thousands of feet above the  field would have been had it been told of a battle in our Civil War.  The world has believed in ghosts for centuries and the Archers of  Mons are the legitimate successors of the Great Twin Brethren at the  Battle of Lake Regillus. But Caesar, Napoleon, perhaps the elder von  Moltke himself would have scoffed at the idea that men could turn  themselves into birds to spy out the enemy's dispositions and save a  sorely menaced army.    When this war has passed into history it will be recognized that its  greatest contributions to military science have been the development  and the use of aircraft and submarines. There have, of course, been  other features in the method of waging war which have been novel  either in themselves, or in the gigantic scale upon which they have  been employed. There is, for example, nothing new about trench  warfare. The American who desires to satisfy himself about that need  only to visit the Military Park at Vicksburg, or the country about  Petersburg or Richmond, to recognize that even fifty years ago our  soldiers understood the art of sheltering themselves from bullet and  shrapnel in the bosom of Mother Earth. The trench warfare in  Flanders, the Argonne, and around Verdun has been novel only in the  degree to which it has been developed and perfected. Concrete-lined  trenches, with spacious and well-furnished bomb-proofs, with  phonographs, printing presses, and occasional dramatic performances  for lightening the soldiers' lot present an impressive elaboration  of the muddy ditches of Virginia and Mississippi. Yet after all the  boys of Grant and Lee had the essentials of trench warfare well in  mind half a century before Germany, France, and England came to  grips on the long line from the North Sea to the Vosges.    Asphyxiating gas, whether liberated from a shell, or released along  a trench front to roll slowly down before a wind upon its  defenders, was a novelty of this war. But in some degree it was  merely a development of the \"stinkpot\" which the Chinese have  employed for years. So too the tear-bomb, or lachrymatory bomb,  which painfully irritated the eyes of all in its neighbourhood when  it burst, filling them with tears and making the soldiers  practically helpless in the presence of a swift attack. These two  weapons of offence, and particularly the first, because of the  frightful and long-continuing agony it inflicts upon its victims,  fascinated the observer, and awakened the bitter protests of those  who held that an issue at war might be determined by civilized  nations without recourse to engines of death and anguish more  barbaric than any known to the red Indians, or the most savage  tribes of Asia. Neither of these devices, nor for that matter the  cognate one of fire spurted like a liquid from a hose upon a  shrinking enemy, can be shown to have had any appreciable effect  upon the fortunes of any great battle. Each, as soon as employed by  any one belligerent, was quickly seized by the adversary, and the  respiratory mask followed fast upon the appearance of the chlorine  gas. Whatever the outcome of the gigantic conflict may be, no one  will claim that any of these devices had contributed greatly to the  result.    But the airplane revolutionized warfare on land. The submarine has  made an almost equal revolution in naval warfare.    Had the airplane been known in the days of our Civil War some of its  most picturesque figures would have never risen to eminence or at  least would have had to win their places in history by efforts of an  entirely different sort. There is no place left in modern military  tactics for the dashing cavalry scout of the type of Sheridan,  Custer, Fitz Lee, or Forrest. The airplane, soaring high above the  lines of the enemy, brings back to headquarters in a few hours  information that in the old times took a detachment of cavalry days  to gather. The \"screen of cavalry\" that in bygone campaigns  commanders used to mask their movements no longer screens nor masks.  A general moves with perfect knowledge that his enemy's aircraft  will report to their headquarters his roads, his strength, and his  probable destination as soon as his vanguard is off. During the  Federal advance upon Richmond, Stonewall Jackson, most brilliant of  the generals of that war, repeatedly slipped away from the Federal  front, away from the spot where the Federal commanders confidently  supposed him to be, and was found days later in the Valley of the  Shenandoah, threatening Washington or menacing the Union rear and  its communications. The war was definitely prolonged by this  Confederate dash and elusiveness--none of which would have been  possible had the Union forces possessed an aviation corps.    [Illustration: _A Battle in Mid-air._    (_Note rifleman on wing of airplane._)    _From the painting by Lieutenant Farre._    Photo by Peter A. Juley.]    It is yet to be shown conclusively that as offensive engines  aircraft have any great value. The tendency of the military  authorities of every side to minimize the damage they have suffered  makes any positive conclusion on this subject difficult and  dangerous at this moment. The airplane by day or the Zeppelin by  night appears swiftly and mysteriously, drops its bombs from a  height of several thousand feet, and takes its certain flight  through the boundless sky to safety. The aggressor cannot tell  whether his bombs have found a fitting target. He reports flaming  buildings left behind him, but whether they are munition factories,  theatres, or primary schools filled with little children he cannot  tell. Nor does he know how quickly the flames were extinguished, or  the amount of damage done. The British boast of successful air raids  upon Cuxhaven, Zeebrugge, Essen, and Friedrichshaven. But if we take  German official reports we must be convinced that the damage done  was negligible in its relation to the progress of the war. In their  turn the Germans brag mightily of the deeds of their Zeppelins over  London, and smaller British towns. But the sum and substance of  their accomplishment, according to the British reports, has been the  slaughter and mutilation of a number of civilians--mostly women and  children--and the bloody destruction of many humble working-class  homes.    At this writing, December, 1917, it is not recorded that any  battleship, munition factory, any headquarters, great government  building, or fortress has been destroyed or seriously injured by the  activities of aircraft of either type. This lack of precise  information may be due to the censor rather than to any lack of  great deeds on the part of airmen. We do know of successful attacks  on submarines, though the military authorities are chary about  giving out the facts. But as scouts, messengers, and guides for  hidden batteries attacking unseen targets, aviators have compelled  the rewriting of the rules of military strategy. About this time,  however, it became apparent that the belligerents intended to  develop the battleplanes. Particularly was this true of the Allies.  The great measure of success won by the German submarines and the  apparent impossibility of coping adequately with those weapons of  death once they had reached the open sea, led the British and the  Americans to consider the possibility of destroying them in their  bases and destroying the bases as well. But Kiel and Wilhelmshaven  were too heavily defended to make an attack by sea seem at all  practicable. The lesser ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend had been  successfully raided from the air and made practically useless as  submarine bases. Discussion therefore was strong of making like  raids with heavier machines carrying heavier guns and dropping more  destructive bombs upon the two chief lurking places of the  submarines. While no conclusion had been reached as to this strategy  at the time of the publication of this book, both nations were busy  building larger aircraft probably for use in such an attack.             *       *       *       *       *    The submarine has exerted upon the progress of the war an influence  even more dominant than that of aircraft. It has been a positive  force both offensive and defensive. It has been Germany's only  potent weapon for bringing home to the British the privations and  want which war entails upon a civilian population, and at the same  time guarding the German people from the fullest result of the  British blockade. It is no overstatement to declare that but for the  German submarines the war would have ended in the victory of the  Allies in 1916.    We may hark back to our own Civil War for an illustration of the  crushing power of a superior navy not qualified by any serviceable  weapon in the hands of the weaker power.    Historians have very generally failed to ascribe to the Federal  blockade of Confederate ports its proportionate influence on the  outcome of that war. The Confederates had no navy. Their few naval  vessels were mere commerce destroyers, fleeing the ships of the  United States navy and preying upon unarmed merchantmen. With what  was rapidly developed into the most powerful navy the world had ever  seen, the United States Government from the very beginning of the  war locked the Confederate States in a wall of iron. None might pass  going in or out, except by stealth and at the peril of property and  life. Outside the harbour of every seaport in the control of the  Confederates the blockading men-of-war lurked awaiting the blockade  runners. Their vigilance was often eluded, of course, yet  nevertheless the number of cargoes that slipped through was  painfully inadequate to meet the needs of the fenced-in States.  Clothing, medicines, articles of necessary household use were denied  to civilians. Cannon, rifles, saltpetre, and other munitions of war  were"]]]
