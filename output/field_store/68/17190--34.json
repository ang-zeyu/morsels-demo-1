Thankful now for such meagre fare and eager for the fullness of  disgusting repasts, in the bounty of other seasons, he becomes an  epicure whom only the choicest food will satisfy. He has the pick of  the fattest grubs; he makes stealthy levies on the earliest robins'  nests; and from some lofty lookout or aerial scout watches the farmer  plant the corn and awaits its sprouting into the dainty tidbits, a  fondness for whose sweetness is his overmastering weakness. For this he  braves the terrible scarecrow and the dread mystery of the cornfield's  lined boundary, for this risks life and forfeits the good name that his  better deeds might give him. If he would not be tempted from grubs and  carrion, what a worthy bird he might be accounted. In what good if  humble repute might he live, how lamented, die. O Appetite! thou base  belly-denned demon, for what sins of birds and men art thou accountable!    In the springtide days, the crow turns aside from theft and robbery to  the softer game of love, whereunto you hear the harsh voice attuned in  cluttering notes. After the wooing the pair begin house building and  keeping.    It is the rudest and clumsiest of all bird architecture that has become  the centre of their cares--such a jumble of sticks and twigs as chance  might pile on its forked foundations; but woe betide the hawk who  ventures near, or owl who dares to sound his hollow trumpet in the  sacred precincts. At the first alarm signal, as suddenly and  mysteriously as Robin Hood's merry men appeared at the winding of his  horn, the black clansmen rally from every quarter of the greenwood, to  assail the intruder and force him to ignominious retreat.    When at last the young crows, having clad their uncouth nakedness with  full sable raiment, are abroad in the world, they, with unwary  foolhardiness and incessant querulous cries of hunger or alarm, are  still a constant source of anxiety to parents and kindred. But in the  late summer, when the youngsters have come to months of discretion and  the elders are freed from the bondage of their care, a long holiday  begins for all the tribe. The corn has long since ceased to tempt them,  and the persecution of man has abated. The shorn meadows and the  close-cropped pastures swarm with grasshoppers, and field and forest  offer their abundant fruits.    Careless and uncared for, what happy lives they lead, sauntering on  sagging wing through the sunshine from chosen field to chosen wood, and  at nightfall encamping in the fragrant tents of the pines.    At last the gay banners of autumn signal departure, and the gathered  clans file away in straggling columns, flecking the blue sky with  pulsating dots of blackness, the green earth with wavering shadows.  Sadly we watch the retreat of the sable cohorts, whose desertion leaves  our northern homes to the desolation of winter.          V    THE MINK      This little fur-bearer, whose color has been painted darker than it is,  singularly making his name proverbial for blackness, is an old  acquaintance of the angler and the sportsman, but not so familiar to  them and the country boy as it was twoscore years ago.    It was a woeful day for the tribe of the mink when it became the fashion  for other folk to wear his coat, which he could only doff with the  subtler garment of life.    Throughout the term of his exaltation to the favor of fashion, he was  lain in wait for at his own door and on his thoroughfares and by-paths  by the traps, dead-falls, and guns of professional and amateur trappers  and hunters, till the fate of his greater cousin the otter seemed to  overtake him. But the fickle empress who raised him to such perilous  estate, changing her mood, thrust him down almost to his old ignoble but  safer rank, just in time to avert the impending doom of extermination.  Once more the places that knew him of old, know him again.    In the March snow you may trace the long span of his parallel footprints  where, hot with the rekindled annual fire of love, he has sped on his  errant wooing, turning not aside for the most tempting bait, halting not  for rest, hungering only for a sweetheart, wearied with nothing but  loneliness. Yet weary enough would you be if you attempted to follow the  track of but one night's wandering along the winding brook, through the  tangle of windfalls, and across the rugged ledges that part stream from  stream. When you go fishing in the first days of summer, you may see the  fruits of this early springtide wooing in the dusky brood taking their  primer-lesson in the art that their primogenitors were adepts in before  yours learned it. How proud one baby fisher is of his first captured  minnow, how he gloats over it and defends his prize from his envious  and less fortunate brothers.    When summer wanes, they will be a scattered family, each member shifting  for himself. Some still haunt the alder thicket where they first saw  light, whose netted shadows of bare branches have thickened about them  to continued shade of leafage, in whose midday twilight the red flame of  the cardinal flower burns as a beacon set to guide the dusky wanderer  home. Others have adventured far down the winding brook to the river,  and followed its slowing current, past rapids and cataract, to where it  crawls through the green level of marshes beloved of water fowl and of  gunners, whose wounded victims, escaping them, fall an easy prey to the  lurking mink.    Here, too, in their season are the tender ducklings of wood duck, teal,  and dusky duck, and, all the year round, fat muskrats, which furnish for  the price of conquest a banquet that the mink most delights in.    In the wooded border are homes ready builded for him under the  buttressed trunks of elms, or in the hollow boles of old water maples,  and hidden pathways through fallen trees and under low green arches of  ferns.    With such a home and such bountiful provision for his larder close at  hand, what more could the heart and stomach of mink desire? Yet he may  not be satisfied, but longs for the wider waters of the lake, whose  translucent depths reveal to him all who swim beneath him, fry  innumerable; perch displaying their scales of gold, shiners like silver  arrows shot through the green water, the lesser bass peering out of  rocky fastnesses, all attainable to this daring fisher, but not his  great rivals, the bronze-mailed bass and the mottled pike, whose jaws  are wide enough to engulf even him.    Here, while you rest on your idle oar or lounge with useless rod, you  may see him gliding behind the tangled net of cedar roots, or venturing  forth from a cranny of the rocks down to the brink, and launching  himself so silently that you doubt whether it is not a flitting shadow  till you see his noiseless wake breaking the reflections lengthening  out behind him.    Of all swimmers that breathe the free air none can compare with him in  swiftness and in a grace that is the smooth and even flow of the poetry  of motion. Now he dives, or rather vanishes from the surface, nor  reappears till his wake has almost flickered out.    His voyage accomplished, he at once sets forth on exploration of new  shores or progress through his established domain, and vanishes from  sight before his first wet footprints have dried on the warm rock where  he landed.    You are glad to have seen him, thankful that he lives, and you hope  that, sparing your chickens and your share of trout, partridges, and  wild ducks, he too may be spared from the devices of the trapper to fill  his appointed place in the world's wildness.          VI    APRIL DAYS      At last there is full and complete assurance of spring, in spite of the  baldness of the woods, the barrenness of the fields, bleak with sodden  furrows of last year's ploughing, or pallidly tawny with bleached grass,  and untidy with the jetsam of winter storms and the wide strewn litter  of farms in months of foddering and wood-hauling.    There is full assurance of spring in such incongruities as a phoebe  a-perch on a brown mullein stalk in the midst of grimy snow banks, and  therefrom swooping in airy loops of flight upon the flies that buzz  across this begrimed remnant of winter's ermine, and of squirrelcups  flaunting bloom and fragrance in the face of an ice cascade, which, with  all its glitter gone, hangs in dull whiteness down the ledges, greening  the moss with the moisture of its wasting sheet of pearl.    The woodchuck and chipmunk have got on top of the world again. You hear  the half querulous, half chuckling whistle of the one, the full-mouthed  persistent cluck of the other, voicing recognition of the season.    The song of the brooks has abated something of its first triumphant  swell, and is often overborne now by the jubilant chorus of the birds,  the jangled, liquid gurgle and raucous grating of the blackbirds, the  robin's joyous song with its frequent breaks, as if the thronging notes  outran utterance, the too brief sweetness of the meadowlark's whistle,  the bluebird's carol, the cheery call of the phoebe, the trill of the  song sparrow, and above them all the triumph of the hawk in its regained  possessions of northern sky and earth.    The woods throb with the muffled beat of the partridge's drum and the  sharp tattoo of the woodpecker, and are filled again with the sounds of  insect life, the spasmodic hum of flies, the droning monotone of bees  busy among the catkins and squirrelcups, and you may see a butterfly,  wavering among the gray trees, soon to come to the end of his life, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#3)"],[1,"wing--free to execute an outflanking movement. It is impossible when a  line extends for miles, and the enemy's strength is not discoverable  before the heat of the engagement, for infantry to come from a great  distance to the assistance of weak points; and by reason of this  immobility it is equally impossible for infantry in the heat of action,  and when the front is extended for miles, to suddenly change a plan of  attack in time to save a situation.    The task set before our Generals was, therefore, almost superhuman: they  were expected to make up for want of mobility with superior strategical  qualifications; but, as has been said, no committee of Generals could at  this juncture have decided on a strategy applicable to the complicated  situation. That the Boer was a born strategist, and had able advisers,  was amply proved. The amalgam of Boer methods, with Zulu theories and  modern German tactics, was sufficient to try the most ingenious  intelligence. For instance, the Boers in early days selected positions  on the sides and tops of kopjes, and at the commencement of the  campaign, at Talana Hill and at Elandslaagte, they were so perched, in  accordance with the primitive principles of their race. They ignored the  fact that such positions were the worst they could select against  artillery fire with percussion fuses. Even for their own rifle practice  such positions were also the worst, as, firing down at an angle, their  bullets as a rule ran the chance of ploughing the earth without  ricocheting, and served only to hit the one man aimed at. They worked,  and still work, on the old Zulu principle of putting their whole  strength into the fighting line, acting on the Zulu axiom, \"Let it  thunder--and pass.\" A sound principle this, no doubt, but one which our  ponderous military machinery would not allow us to adopt. To these early  methods, and to his native \"slimness\" and cunning, the Boer now added  some German erudition. The influence of German officers and German  tactics began to work changes curious and inexplicable. The Boers built  scientific entrenchments, no longer on the kopjes alone but also below  them, thus reducing the effect of hostile artillery, save that of  howitzers, and permitting their sharpshooters to sweep the plain with a  hurricane from their Mausers. In addition to this they built long  castellated trenches, perfect underground avenues, to allow of the  invisible massing of troops at any given point. They were also provided  with ingenious gun-trenches, quite hidden, along which their Nordenfeldt  gun, that pumped five shells in rapid succession, could be removed  swiftly from one spot to another, and thereby defeat the efforts of the  British gunners to locate it.    Thus it will be seen a new complexion was put upon Boer affairs. Novel  and trying conditions were imposed on those who already had to cope  with the problem of how to match in mobility a rival who brought to his  support six legs, while the British only brought two. Whole armies  consisting merely of mounted infantry and artillery had never before  come into action, and it began to be understood that a war against  bushwhackers, guerillas, and sharpshooters, plus the most expensive guns  modernity could provide, was a matter more serious than any with which  the nineteenth century had hitherto had to deal. We had to learn that  sheer pluck, endurance, and brute force were unavailing, and that  strategy of the hard and fast kind--the red-tape strategy of the Staff  College--was about as unpractical as a knowledge of the classics to one  who goes a-marketing. There is no finality in the art of war, and  nations, be they ever so old and wise and important, must go on  learning.    One of the newer questions was, how far personal intelligence might be  distributed among a body of men? The General as a head, the Staff  Officers as nerves that convey volition to the different members, we had  accepted, but how far individual acumen was needed to insure success now  began to be argued. Certain it was that in this campaign we had  opportunities for studying the comparative value of individual  discretion _versus_ \"fighting to order.\" The Boers, every one of them,  were working for themselves, absolutely for hearth and home, though  perhaps under a general plan which certainly served to harass and annoy  and keep the British army in a dilemma; while we laboured on a  consolidated system which, if not obsolete, was certainly inappropriate.  However, as there was no use in bemoaning our reverses, we began to  congratulate ourselves on having discovered the cause of them. It was  decided that first there must be more troops sent out to meet the  extended nature of our operations, and that these troops must be  accompanied by a sufficient number of horses to insure the necessary  mobility, without which even the brute force of our numbers would be  useless.    Of the successful issue of future proceedings none had a doubt. All knew  that the finest strategy in the world must be useless when tools were  wanting, and all felt certain that the admirable abilities of our  Generals, when once the means of playing their war game came to hand,  were bound to rise to the prodigious task still in store.    But for the dire necessity of the three gallant towns--Mafeking,  Kimberley, and Ladysmith--a waiting game would have been possible and  wise. The Boer stores of food and ammunition would eventually have run  out, and the guns gone the way of much-used guns. Trek-oxen, instead of  dragging the waggons of their masters, would have had to go to feed the  hungry commandoes, and the history of slow exhaustion would have had to  be told. But--again there was the great But!--those three valiant towns  were holding out their hands, they were crying for help, they were  standing in their hourly peril hopeful and brave because they  believed--they were certain--that we should never desert them!      At home the grievous news of the reverse was digested by the public with  dumb, almost paralysed resignation. At first it was scarcely possible to  believe that the great, the long-anticipated move for the relief of  Ladysmith had proved a failure, and that the Boers were still masters of  the situation, and moreover the richer by eleven of our much-needed  guns. By degrees the terrible truth began to be accepted by us. By  degrees the Government awakened to the fact that the fighting of the  Dutchmen within the region of Natal meant more than the pitting of one  Briton against two Boers, that it meant the dashing of a whole Army  Corps against Nature's strongholds, our own by right of purchase and  blood, and captured from us merely by reason of neglect and delay!    To awake, however, was to act. In our misfortune it was pleasant to  recall the words of Jomini, when speaking of Frederick the Great and his  defeats in Silesia. \"A series of fortunate events,\" he said, \"may dull  the greatest minds, deprive them of their natural vigour, and level them  with common beings. But adversity is a tonic capable of bringing back  energy and elasticity to those who have lost it.\" The tonic was sipped.  Jomini's theories were proved! Though Great Britain through a series of  fortunate events--a long reign of comparative peace--had become  lethargic and money-grubbing, she, at the first shock of adversity,  regained all her elasticity, vigour, and natural spirit of chivalry.  Promptly the entire nation nerved itself to prove that, as of old, it  was equal to any struggle, any sacrifice. The whole country seemed with  one consent to leap to arms.    The Militia, nine battalions of Infantry, was now permitted to volunteer  for service in any part of the Queen's dominions where such services  might be wanted, while it was arranged that specially selected  contingents of Yeomanry and Volunteers would start for the Front as soon  as there were found ships sufficient to carry them.    Noble as amazing was the hurried response of the Volunteers to the  intimation that their services would be accepted for the war. Hastily  they pressed forward in crowds to enrol themselves. Their promptitude  was goodly to look upon and to read of, for it showed that, in spite of  the theories of Tolstoi and the influence of the spirit of modernity,  patriotism is inherent and not a mere exotic or cultivated sentiment in  the British race. We now found that though many traditions may be worn  to rags, those of the British army had grown, like old tapestry, the  more precious for the passage of time.    Still the military position was pregnant with anxieties. A horse that is  left at the post may perhaps win in the end, but his chances of success  are remote. An army that lands in driblets three months after time is  scarcely calculated to succeed against a rival army which has spent that  interval in equipping itself for the fray. We were forced to remember  that at the onset our officers were placed in the most dangerous  positions, with inadequate support and no prospect of reinforcement,  until their energies, mental and physical, had been sapped by undue and  prolonged strain. On the north Tuli had but a handful of troops to  resist an enormous and powerful enemy; Mafeking was surrounded,  isolated, and able only to resist to the death the persistent attacks of  shot and shell; Vryburg was allowed to be treacherously given away to  the enemy; and Kimberley was left in the lurch as it were, to fight or  fall according to the pluck of those who were ready to exhaust their  vitality in loyalty to the Queen. On the Natal side things were still  worse. The country, every inch of which is familiar to the Boer, had  almost invited invasion. The whole strength of Boers and Free Staters  was permitted to launch itself against an army which was entirely  without reserves, and which could not be reinforced under a month. That  brave and unfortunate soldier, Sir George Colley, had a "]]]
