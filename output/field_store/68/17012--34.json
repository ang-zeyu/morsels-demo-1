(#3)"],[1," reason is this, the fine cerebral  organization of Christ was of God. Hence we have it, first cause, God;  second cause, Christ; effect, Christianity. Common admission, Christ is  the grandest character, the purest life, the finest teacher, finest  organization ever yet given to the race. The Christian says, _Amen!_ But  science must find a cause for every effect. What was the cause of the  teachings of the apostles, whose sincerity was such that they died for  their religion? Well, Strauss says, It is inconceivable that they should  have done it if Jesus himself had not designated himself as the Redeemer  from sin, guilt and death, and required faith in his person as a  religious duty, claiming the power to secure peace in the Holy Spirit.  According to Strauss, we have this arrangement:    First, the infinite--the Godhead took the finite Jesus into itself.    Second, he was above suspicion--the finest, purest specimen of all ever  known among men. A.G. Davis, R.D. Owen, Renan and Gregg, and Tom Paine,  and a host of others in unbelief say _Amen!_ Gregg says God sent him,  and sent him to do _just that_ which he did do. Strauss says, He taught  his desciples, and they consequently taught the world.          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION.    THE TEN SCEPTICS IN COUNCIL--No. 3.    BY P.T. RUSSELL.      _Christian._ Gentlemen; I am happy to meet you again. Be seated. Have  you weighed the matter I gave you in our last interview? If you have, I  would like to hear your objections, if you have any.    _Reason._ We think we have some valid objections. First, we are  satisfied that your position is unscientific, although it is ingeniously  taken. Among scientific men it is conceded that nature reveals her own  birth, and declares her creation. Now, if it is true that Nature  _herself_ tells the history of her origin, then your idea that God the  creator told this, is to us unreasonable, for there is no need of the  same story being told to the same auditors by two different parties; so  we must regard your position as untrue.    _Christian._ Are you sure that Nature ever gave the history of her  origin, of her birth? do you read it in the book of Nature, or does she  tell it vocally?    _Reason._ Tell it vocally? No! Nature has no power of speech! She wrote  the history of her origin upon the pages of her own book, and the eye of  the Scientist reads it there.    _Christian._ Are you certain of this? how was she qualified to do so?  Could you write the history of your origin, of your birth, without the  aid of some one older than yourself? Did you have the powers of  observation in active exercise, watching every movement among the causes  that brought you into being? Now, if man could not be an eye-witness to  his own origin, upon this planet of ours, was there anything else in  nature that could be, and so gave that history, which you know you could  not? Is it not possible that you have obtained your intelligence from  another source--from what I call the revelation of the Creator? May it  not be true that you have thus borrowed your information, and falsely  credited it to Nature? If you found it in the book of Nature and read it  there, you can tell me on what page it is written? will you do this so  that I may read it too?    _Reason._ Read it there, and on some certain or well-known page! Really,  you are very captious. This great truth is on every page; the whole face  of Nature declares it; I can not tell you anything about the page.    _Christian._ There is a German maxim which, translated into English,  reads, \"The clear is the true.\" The natural converse of this German  proposition is this: The truth of the ambiguous is very doubtful. This  leaves your claim in a very suspicious condition, if it does not brand  it with falsehood. Again, you say it was written in the book of Nature.  By whom was it written? A book can not write itself. Nature, or the  material universe, neither did nor could write it, for she has no power  of action, inertia being her property. She might be acted upon. I can  write upon this sheet, but it can not write upon itself. If it is  written upon it is _self-evident_ that a foreign power has done it. So  Nature, being the aggregate of everything, can not move without the hand  of a foreign power moving her. I suppose you are now ready to ask, \"Is  it not a scientific truth that matter is eternal?\"    _Reason._ Yes, we are satisfied that matter is uncreated, and hence  eternal. The idea that something was made of nothing might do for the  dark ages, but it will not stand the test now. The penetrating eye of  the scientist has exploded that dream.    _Christian._ I am glad to hear you speak thus with confidence, and yet  the sequel may show that you are the dreamer. Science, falsely so  called, has declared matter eternal. True science contradicts this.  \"None of the processes of Nature, since the time when Nature began, have  produced the slightest difference in the properties of any molecule. We  are therefore unable to ascribe either the existence of the molecules,  or the identity of their properties, to the operation of any of the  causes which we call natural. The quality of each molecule gives it the  essential character of a manufactured article, and precludes the idea of  its being eternal and self-existent.\"--Prof. Clark Maxwell, lectures  delivered before the British Association, at Bradford, in Nature, vol.  8, p. 441.    Prof. Maxwell is a star of first magnitude among British scientists; he  has made a specialty of molecular organizations. No real scholar would  dare to risk his standing by disputing the conclusion of Prof. Maxwell.  An idea that is shut out by matter of fact discoveries will not be made  the basis of an argument by any scholar who has not been taking a \"Rip  Van Winkle sleep\" while the rest of the world has been advancing. The  great improvements resulting in the astonishing increase of power has  enabled us to closely examine the smallest known particles of matter,  molecules. And under the best glasses, these give every possible  indication of being a created, or manufactured article.    Thus, the latest and most grand discoveries in this field of science do  unequivocally confirm the declaration of Moses in Gen. 2: 3, where,  according to the Hebrew in which he wrote, speaking of the creation of  all things, he gives us this idea, \"Which God created to make.\" See  marginal reading, Gen. 2: 3. Hebrew scholars tell me this is the correct  reading. The word, rendered, \"and made,\" is in the infinitive mood, and  hence should read, \"to make;\" also, that the word rendered, \"created\" is  the proper term by which to indicate the producing cause. This, then, is  the thought presented by both of our witnesses, _i.e._, by Moses and  science. Moses says God created the material to make globes, or worlds.  The material was molecular, and science declares that every molecule  gives every possible indication of being manufactured or created. So,  true scientific discoveries have so completely vindicated the Mosaic  cosmogony that it leaves no chance for any, outside of three classes, to  object. For two of these classes I am not writing, viz., the cowardly  and the dishonest. To do this would be \"casting pearls before swine.\"  But for the ignorant I send this on its mission. Read and digest. In my  next I will demonstrate the divine origin of language and religion. Till  then, farewell.          INFIDELS IN A LOGICAL TORNADO.      There is nothing but matter. Matter is eternal. Therefore all things are  eternal. Does this have the right ring? It must be so if infidel  materialism be the true philosophy. And if it is so we are all deceived;  for universal conscience, and universal language, are both against it.    If there is anything that is not eternal there was a time when it began  to be, it was created in some way, intelligently or by accident. If  intelligently, the Bible idea is, and _must be_ correct. If without an  intelligence it was not, and could not be by evolution, for creation by  evolution could not, and can not be; because that which is not in a  thing can not be evolved out of it, unless you can get more out of a  thing than there is in it; which is absurd. So evolution is a negation  of the doctrine of a creation. And the doctrine that there is nothing  but matter, and that matter is eternal, is a denial of creation by  intelligence or otherwise. The infidel says, life began to be; for there  was a time when there was no life. But they say matter is eternal. And  life is not eternal. Therefore life is not matter. Gentlemen, will you  get away with this conclusion? The opposite is equally fatal to the  materialistic theory. Thus, matter is eternal. There is nothing but  matter. Therefore life is eternal. Can you get this conclusion out of,  or away from logical deductions?    But infidels say, \"Life is a property of certain elements of matter.\"  Very well; can you separate things and their properties? Can you get  them so far apart as to hold the one class--things--to be eternal, and  the other class--properties--not? Your philosophy of spontaneous  generation of life says, Yes, yes, there was a time when it began to be,  and it was spontaneously generated, of course it was. Very well; there  is nothing but matter. Matter did not begin to be; it is eternal. Life  began to be, therefore it is not matter; otherwise it is eternal  according to infidel logic, unless you take the position that life is  _nothing_!    Matter is eternal.    That which began to be is not eternal.    Mind began to be;    Therefore, mind is not eternal.    Very well; let's look at it once more.    Matter is eternal; it did not begin to be.    Mind is not eternal; it began to be;    Therefore, mind is not matter.    Where, gentlemen, O where will you place mind? is it also nothing?    That which began to be was created.    Life and mind, both, began to be;    Therefore,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28673"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#3)"],[1,"with the cross or death of Christ. For this  great love for man, manifested even in his death, He gained the throne  of Lordship, where He exercises himself as the Savior of men and as Lord  over all. Will you obey Him and live?          THE SIMPLICITY OF THE SCIENCE OF MIND.      Our sphere of research is simplified by dividing its objects into matter  and mind, so as to have but two centers of thought. Many have concluded  that the address of matter to our senses has made it easy to pursue  knowledge respecting bodies, while the invisibility of mind presents  insurmountable difficulties, but this conclusion is scarcely supported  by facts. If men have erred with reference to their own intellects, they  have also made many and egregious blunders concerning matter and its  qualities. We think the study of mind is just as easy as the study of  matter. Here a man has nothing to do but look into himself. With my mind  I think, reason, reflect, remember, hate, love, grieve, rejoice,  imagine, contrive, invent and will, and this very mind is conscious of  all these operations; so in this study there ought to be no mistake. We  lay it down as a truth of first importance, that all minds are alike. As  gold is gold, so mind is mind, throughout the universe. My mind is  myself, which I carry with me everywhere; it is my own personality from  which I can never part. It is the individual Walker. _Individual_ is  defined thus: An object which is, in the strict and primary sense, one,  and can not be logically divided.    An _individual_ is not absolutely indivisible, but that which can not be  divided without losing its name and distinctive qualities.  Individuality, like personal identity, belongs properly to  intelligences. Consciousness reveals it to us that no being can be put  in our place nor confounded with us, nor we with others. I am one and  indivisible. You can not amputate any of the faculties of the mind. It  is a mind which no one dissects or divides. We are assured that we are  the offspring of God. Paul says this truth had been promulgated by one  of the Athenian poets, and it was so correct that Heaven's seal was  placed upon it. Being the offspring of God we are essentially like our  Great Father Spirit, for it is one of the laws of God that the child or  descendant shall always be like its progenitor; not like him in body,  for God is a spirit. A spirit hath not flesh and bone. We are therefore  like Him in spirit. Being the offspring of the divine intelligence  declares the nature of that intelligence, just as the stream declares  the nature of the water in the fountain which feeds it. As the fountain  is the antecedent of the stream, so God is the antecedent of life and  intelligence, from whom all spirits came, and to whom all spirits must  return.    Our studies in respect of mind are wonderfully simplified when we  recollect that in ourselves we see all other men, spirit or mind being  in its essence and attributes essentially the same; but the fountain is  always greater than the stream, so God is more wise and powerful than  any of his offspring. But as each perfect sunbeam, however small or  weak, has all the essential properties of light, and each grain of pure  silver all the properties of that metal, so mind, as the living  offspring of the divine mind, is in the \"likeness and image of God.\"  This branch of study becomes remarkably simple when we reflect that in  ourselves we see all men and women, angels and demons, and even God  himself. The whole universe of mind is reflected in that inner-man  mirror which we call _ourself_. We have guarded this subject by the  language, _the essential attributes of mind_. By this qualifier we wish  it understood that mind, like body, has its accidental or acquired  qualities. Vice, virtue, folly, wisdom, malignity and benevolence are  not essential to mind, but like the accidents of matter known as  roughness or smoothness, softness, hardness, blackness, etc., are merely  qualities or attributes of its conduct. Vice is vicious action and  virtue is virtuous action. But action arises from will and will from  thought. All minds are free agents, being vicious or virtuous from their  own choice. There is as much piety, morality or immorality in the  flowing of the Wabash river as there is in involuntary action. So  ability to choose is the great factor of morality, virtue, immorality,  and vice.    In scientific investigations lying in the realm of the physical there  are countless objects to engage our thoughts, but here we have but one,  and we always carry it about with us and are continually using it. Our  _consciousness_ is to all the operations of our spirits what seeing,  touching, hearing, tasting and smelling is to surrounding bodies. It  enables us to examine all the minds in the universe. Would you like to  have an organ which would enable you to see spirits? In your  _consciousness_ you have a faculty superior to all the five senses put  together. In our consciousness we see and feel ourselves, and in so  doing we see not only the minds of others, but our great Father himself.  We can not tell what instincts are in the bee, or what sagacity is in a  spaniel, because we are neither spaniels nor bees, but we are of a more  noble race. We are in possession of minds or spirits, and consequently  identified with all minds or spirits, so the science of mind, or  psychology, is the knowledge of ourselves.    Christianity, as a spiritual system, takes us and all its votaries into  this intellectual temple, where we may certainly know God through a  correct knowledge of self. In this temple we have a sample of the  spirits of men, angels and demons, and over all, an example of the  spirit we worship. These invisible intelligences are the wonderful  agencies through which good and evil are effected. Natural laws are  only the rules by which the great Father Spirit acts. Laws are rules by  which agents act, and they always imply agents. Men of olden times are  often spoken of as great metaphysicians. Who has not heard of Homer,  Herodotus, Pindar, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Plato and many others. But  those ancient men, here as in physics, dealt so much in fancy that they  were not disposed to enter into the simple examination of their own  minds or spirits. Entangled in the doctrines of chance, fate and destiny  they robbed the Creator of the sceptre of the universe. They placed  Jove, their supreme deity, under a decree that he could not change;  confessed that he could not, in many instances, help them when he  desired to do so. The greatest hindrances to progress among them were  their failures to know the true character of Jove, or their want of a  correct knowledge of God, and the distinction between mind and matter.  They failed to separate between the two. Their gods were continually in  an abominable quarrel about some interest that involved human welfare,  and for that very reason their theory of mind was nothing but a confused  mass of childish stories. They had no starting point from which to  reason. They, failing to separate between mind and matter, were led into  endless theories about what they denominated the animal and intellectual  soul. The idea of one of their own poets that we are God's offspring was  of no avail, in science, to them, because they neither knew themselves  nor their gods. We are, therefore, indebted to the Bible for our  superior knowledge in the science of mind. If the Gospel had never  reached us we would have been as great dreamers in mental science as the  mystics of India.    The doctrine of one Creator, who is a perfect spirit, and the father of  our spirits, and that he presides over all nature for the good of the  whole; that matter is inert, and moves not unless as it is moved; that  all life and force is in mind or spirit; that all spirits are free  agents, and act from choice; that all spirits have the same essential  attributes; and that man is of the divine \"_genos_\" kind or sort, and,  as an intellectual being, is therefore in the image of God, has  simplified and extended our researches in the science of mind, and based  them on reason and common sense as well as revelation. From such  considerations the doctrine of universal brotherhood has proceeded along  with the equal, civil, political and religious rights of all mankind.  The ultimate fruit of all is the abolition of oppression and slavery  throughout the world, and the desire to see all men elevated to their  proper rank as intellectual and moral beings. Thus our views of God and  nature, of mind and matter, are of immense practical value to our race.    Do you say mind or spirit does not belong as a real factor to science?  Well, we are astonished! Science is correct, or certain knowledge  arising from a deep and rational inquiry into the object or subject of  investigation. The question therefore comes back again, have we any  knowledge of mind? This is to ask, whether consciousness is knowledge!  The term comes from the Latin \"_con_,\" which signifies together, and  \"_scio_,\" I know, and is used to convey the idea that we know the thing  altogether, that is, have perfect or full knowledge. It is the mind's  testimony concerning itself. Now, if I can become acquainted with  external and material objects through my senses, certainly my  consciousness of my own mental operations is, and must be, more certain  and self-evident. In judging, reasoning, reflecting, choosing, desiring,  remembering, loving, hating and hoping, along with all other operations  of mind, I must know the operation intimately, perfectly and altogether.  If I am reflecting, I know it, and this consciousness is science, is  certain knowledge, is the very thing from which no man can escape so  long as he is a rational being. Here is my individuality, my  personality, in that which is the indivisible unit of my nature, from  which I can not emigrate, and one attribute of which I "]]]
