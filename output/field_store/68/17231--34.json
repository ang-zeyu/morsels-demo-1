Why, if all that  is alleged is true, will they persist in sinking more wells, when,  as they say, they are controlled by the Standard Oil Company? No one  forces them to lose money by continuing in the business. Let them find  other employment. They do not show that the Standard Oil Company  does anything that combined capital on their part and equal business  ability could not effect.    The cry of monopoly in this case is altogether unfounded, those  opposed to the Standard Oil Company having just as much right to do  all that that company does, and, therefore, there can be no monopoly,  because they have no exclusive powers.    As to the railway companies, they can afford and have a right to  transport the tonnage offered them by the Standard Oil Company at less  cost, because it costs them less to do a regular and large business  than an irregular and smaller one. They would simply be acting in  accordance with business principles the world over.    These are the arguments, the statement of the position of a successful  combination confident in its resources and of victory in the coming  struggle. The justness, the correctness of the doctrines enunciated,  and the wisdom of so doing at this crisis, we do not propose to  criticise; but it is very safe to say that if the prosperity of the  complainants depends upon relief in this direction they may as well  cease producing.    There are too many of them for harmonious and concerted action against  the powerful corporations they complain of; and if they should succeed  in securing equal transportation facilities the prices would still be  regulated by the monopolists, who carry more than four-fifths of the  accumulated stock of the oil regions.    The proposed appeal to Congress to pass some law whereby each producer  can compel railroad companies to carry his produce at regular rates,  amounts to a confession of the desperate straits of the producers  and of their weakness as well; and even if successful, which is most  improbable, would not remedy the deplorable existing state of things.    Still lower rates would fail to give relief, with all the present  avenues of trade filled to repletion and with an increasing output  at the wells. Relief and permanent relief can be found only in the  direction we have before indicated: in the general application of  petroleum and its products to the manufacture of gas for illuminating  and heating purposes, and its substitution for coal in the metallurgic  and other prominent industries of the world.           *       *       *       *       *          THE LIMIT OF WORK.      In distributing the prizes to workmen at the Paris Exhibition, Louis  Blanc, the leader of the French Republican Socialist party, quoted  approvingly these words of Simonde de Sismondi:    \"If the workman were his own master, when he had done in two hours  with the aid of machinery what would have taken him twelve hours to do  without it, he would stop at the end of the two.\"    M. Blanc had been discussing very eloquently, but also very  fallaciously, the relations of machinery to labor. If men were  properly united in the bonds of association, he said, if the  solidarity of interests were realized, \"the happy result of the  application of mechanical power to industry would be equal production,  with less of effort, for all. The discovery of an economic method  would never have the lamentable consequence of robbing men of the work  by which they live. Unfortunately, we are far from this ideal. Under  the empire of that universal antagonism which is the very essence of  the economic constitution of modern societies, and which too often  only profits one man by ruining another, machinery has been employed  to make the rule of the strong weigh more heavily on the weak. There  is not a single mechanical invention which has not been a subject of  anguish and a cause of distress to thousands of fathers of families  from the moment it began to work.\"    If all this, and much else that M. Blanc alleges, were true, then the  condition of all workingmen to-day should be in every way worse than  that of their fathers, in anti-machinery days. But such is not the  case. There never was a time when the laborer toiled less or enjoyed  more than in these days of machinery; and the laborer's condition is  best where the machinery is best and most used.    A hundred years ago the laborer toiled long, produced little, and  enjoyed less. To-day, thanks to the victories of invention, machinery  does the heaviest of the work; the workman's hours of labor are fewer  than formerly; his wages are greater; and his earnings will buy vastly  more, dollar for dollar, than in any previous age in the world's  history.    What laborer of to-day would be satisfied with the remuneration, the  food, the shelter, the clothing of the laboring classes of one hundred  years ago? The wants of men, as well as their thoughts, are widened by  the process of the suns. And in no section of society have the daily  wants been more markedly increased, or the facilities for gratifying  them either, than among those that live by labor.    \"If the workman were his own master, when he had done in two hours  with the aid of machinery what it would have taken him twelve hours to  do without it, he would stop at the end of the two.\"    So says the theoretical socialist. The practical workman never has,  nor, we believe, ever will, act so foolishly; certainly not until the  limit of man's capacity to enjoy has been reached. When the united  products of manual and mechanical effort fully satisfy the desires of  all men, and leave no margin of want unfilled, then and then only  will men be satisfied with the reduction of effort demanded by the  socialists. Until then the larger part of every increase in production  by mechanical improvements will go to swell the volume of good things  for human use and enjoyment. Our machinery enables our thousands of  busy workers to accomplish what millions could not have done years  ago, and a very large part of the aggregate increase of product  comes back to them in conveniences and luxuries surpassing those  the wealthiest could enjoy were machinery not employed, or were it  employed, as the socialist advocates, without increasing the aggregate  of production. The laziness of the savage and the advantages of  civilization are incompatible. The chief merit of machinery lies in  its enabling us to multiply constantly the scope and variety of our  enjoyments without a corresponding increase of toil.           *       *       *       *       *          IRIDESCENT GLASS.      Ornamental glassware in many styles, tinted with the glowing colors  of the rainbow, is now making its appearance in the shop windows  of Broadway and Fifth Avenue. This is one of those brilliant little  achievements of science that delights the eye and pleases the  imagination. To produce the colors, the glass, while in a heated  state, is subjected to the vapor of chloride of tin. Shades of more or  less depth or intensity are imparted by adding to the tin chloride a  little nitrate of strontium or barium.           *       *       *       *       *          RAILS AND RAILWAY ACCIDENTS--NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.      A meeting of the Section of Physics, New York Academy of Sciences,  was held November 25, 1878. President J. S. Newberry in the chair.  Numerous publications of learned societies were received and  acknowledged. Professor Newberry read a letter from Professor Agassiz  stating that sea lilies, which had hitherto been very rare--a single  specimen bringing as much as fifty dollars--have been found in some  numbers by dredging in the Gulf of Mexico. Their colors are white,  pink, and yellow. Professor Newberry also exhibited specimens of  garnet from California, lamellar quartz from North Carolina, sharks'  teeth belonging to the eocene and miocene tertiary ages from the  phosphate beds of South Carolina, and a number of shells.    Professor Thomas Egleston then addressed the Academy on the subject of  \"The Structure of Rails as Affecting Railway Accidents.\"    The destruction of rails is due to three causes. 1. Defects in the  manufacture; 2. Improper mechanical or chemical composition; and 3.  Physical changes.    A very large number of rails are annually made which should never be  put in any track. Their defects are often imperceptible to the naked  eye, but they very soon begin to break. Statistics show that the  breakage from defects in making increase until they have been used  18 months; then it decreases to zero, and after that rails break from  different causes. In France, breakage usually begins in December,  reaches its maximum in January, and becomes normal in April. As a more  intense cold would be necessary to explain such breakage than that  which is felt in that climate, the cause must be sought in the  stiffness and inelasticity of the frozen road bed. The impact of  the locomotive is then apt to break the rail, very much on the same  principle that is taken advantage of in breaking them up for the  manufacture of smaller objects. A nick is made somewhere, and the  workman then strikes a blow with a hammer at a point between the nick  and the place where the rail is supported. This will sever the rail at  the nicked place. Sometimes more than a second intervenes between the  blow and the fracture. Now, whenever holes are punched in rails for  the fish plates, flaws are apt to radiate from them; and if these  flaws are not planed or filed out, they may cause the rail to break,  just as the nicks above mentioned. Such rails have been known to last  no longer than 18 months, and some have actually broken on the way  from the manufacturer to their destination. There are establishments  in this country and in Europe where they \"doctor\" such rails by  filling up the flaws with a mixture of iron filings, sal ammoniac, and  some adhesive substance."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38482"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XLIII.â€”No. 1.

Another  evidence of the superiority of the American system, as emphasized in  the report, is the fact that a sixth grade Waltham watch, one of the  cheapest tested, showed a better performance than many very expensive  and otherwise first class watches of other makes.    The moral of the victory is happily drawn in the following editorial  review of the contest and its lessons, by the Sydney _Morning Herald_  of April 14, last:    \"The report of the judges in horology, which we published on Saturday  last, was a document of more than ordinary interest. The slightest  glance at it will show that the judges brought no small amount of  ability and industry to their task. In many other classes of exhibits  judging must, to no small extent, be a matter of opinion. There is  no absolute test by which one photograph, for example, or one oil  painting can be decided to be superior to another. In exhibits of  this kind much must be left to the taste of the critic. Watches and  chronometers, on the other hand, can be submitted to the minutest  tests. The care and trouble which these require are not small, but  the issue is sufficiently important to warrant all the labor which  the judges in horology brought to their work. Time-keepers that can be  relied upon in all weathers and in all climates, and that are within  reach of all classes, are a luxury of no common order, but to a large  number of persons they are a necessity also. In these fast days, when  everything must be done to time, it is for a variety of purposes  found necessary to make accurate divisions, not merely of the days  and hours, but of the minutes and seconds also. The verdict which the  judges in our Exhibition have pronounced on the Waltham watches is  one of which any company might be proud; but the facts on which the  verdict is based are as interesting to the public at large as to the  parties immediately concerned. One of the secrets of American progress  lies first in the invention of machinery, and then in its application  to almost all descriptions of industry. It is the bringing of  machinery to every branch of watchmaking that is enabling Americans to  beat the world in this as well as in many other things.    \"There has been a general belief that a machine-made watch is not to  be compared to one that is hand-made, and that on this account the  English watch must always hold its own against the American. This  belief will have to be given up, if it is not given up already. It has  now been established that machinery can be used for the purposes of  watchmaking with quite as much success as for those of agriculture.  The Americans are showing that they can make better watches than  the Swiss or the English, but, what is of equal importance, they  are showing that they can make them for less money. The boast of the  Yankees is that they can turn out work cheaper and better than anybody  else, and that for that reason the world must take their products.  It would be difficult to prove that in some departments the boast is  wholly without foundation. The American mechanic is paid better than  the English mechanic, and yet the work which he turns out can, as a  rule, be sold for less. The reason is, not only that he works harder,  but that the assistance of machinery enables him to produce the  largest result by the smallest amount of labor.    \"Mr. Brassey, who believes that the workmen of his own country are  equal if not superior to any in the world, maintains that an English  mechanic can do more work than an American mechanic. The American  really does more, because the inducements to industry are greater, and  because he has better machinery. The success of the Waltham Company  has furnished a striking instance of this. This company has now not  only well-nigh driven foreign watchmaking companies out of America,  but it has shown that it can more than compete with them on their own  ground. This arises partly from the fact that it can turn out the best  work on a large scale, but also from the fact that the principle on  which it operates enables it to do all this economically. The  Waltham Company claims to have arrived at simplicity, uniformity, and  precision in the manufacture of watches, and the report of our judges  shows that its claim is well founded. One of its discoveries was that  a simple instrument, where simplicity is possible, will cost less and  be worth more than a complicated one. Another was that the making  of all instruments of the same grade exactly alike, so that the part  which belongs to one belongs to the whole, will not only facilitate  manufacture, but will greatly economize it. A third was, that  these properties of simplicity and interchangeability are the best  guarantees of perfect exactitude. The success which the Americans have  reached in this as well as in other branches of industry, ought  to excite the gratitude rather than the jealousy of the world. Any  company or nation that shows how a maximum of efficiency can be  reached by a minimum of labor confers a benefit on mankind. This  our American cousins have done in other spheres besides that of  watchmaking. There are branches of the prosperity of the Americans  that are traceable to the extent of their territory and the fertility  of their soil; but the triumph of their machinery has been the result  of their inventiveness and of their enterprise, and for that reason it  points a moral that Australians might profitably observe.\"           *       *       *       *       *          A REMARKABLE LITTLE STEAMER.    There is soon to set sail from London for New York a new and  remarkable little steamer of 70 tons gross burden, named the  Anthracite, designed to exhibit the advanced engineering ideas of  Mr. Loftus Perkins, of England. The distinctive peculiarities of this  steamer are the very high steam pressure that she carries--350 to 500  lb. to the square inch, and the small consumption of fuel--one pound  of coal per hour per horsepower. A trial trip of this new little boat  was lately made of 46 miles, during which 350 lb. steam pressure was  steadily maintained, 132 revolutions per minute of propeller, and a  speed of eight knots per hour. Other vessels, some of larger size than  the above, have been built on the Perkins system, and are running  in England. One of them, the yacht Emily, carries 500 lb. boiler  pressure. Most of our readers are familiar with Mr. Perkins' system,  which has been fully described in our columns. Those who may wish to  refer thereto are directed to an interesting article by Mr. Perkins,  with engravings, published in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No.  81, July 21, 1877; also to the description of the steam ferry boat,  run on this principle, given with three pages of engravings in our  SUPPLEMENT No. 217.    Engineering theory and practice have for a long time plainly pointed  to high steam pressures as one of the surest ways to economy of fuel.  Twenty five years ago our ocean steamers carried only 16 lb. pressure  to the inch, and burned 5 to 6 lb. of coal per hour per horse power.  To-day they are carrying 75 lb. pressure, and burning 21/2 to 3 lb. of  coal per hour per horse power.    In 1840 the Britannia, one of the finest steamers of the Cunard line  plying between this country and England, burned 5,291 lb. of coal for  each ton of paying freight she carried, her speed, then considered  fast, being 81/2 knots per hour. In 1877 the Britannic, speed 15.6 knots  per hour, burned only 551 lb. of coal per ton of freight carried.    Although our present steamers are making fast time and are very  economical as compared with earlier vessels, still it is a lamentable  fact that on the largest and finest of them, furnished with all the  latest improvements and best appliances to secure economy, worked by  the most careful and intelligent engineers, we succeed in putting  into our steam only about one tenth of the heat realized in our  boiler fire, the remaining nine-tenths of the heat being lost. Only in  proportion as we make our steam hotter, and expanding it more, shall  we economize in fuel. In this respect the voyage of the Anthracite is  designed by her owners, we presume, to be an eye-opener for steamboat  owners, not only in this country but throughout the world. If a little  bit of a boat like this, 84 feet long, 16 feet beam, and 10 feet deep,  can carry its own coal and water across the Atlantic, with a pressure  of 350 to 500 lb. to the inch, and on one pound of coal per horse  power, the natural inference is that our great steamers, when fitted  with the same system, will realize far better results. The change from  three pounds of coal to one pound per horse power means a shaving of  two thirds in the coal bill, which is always an enormous item in the  expenses of large boats. We ought to add that another peculiarity of  the Anthracite is that she uses the same boiler water over and over,  only a trifle of fresh water being supplied to make good the slight  waste. Our New York steamboat men, who have to pay so dear for Croton  water, will be likely to examine the water tank of the Anthracite with  interest.           *       *       *       *       *          A STRANGE EPIDEMIC.    On the night of Tuesday, June 15, a remarkable epidemic fell upon  several towns in western Massachusetts, the town of Adams  suffering most severely. Out of a population of 6,000, several  hundred--variously estimated from 600 to over 1,000--were prostrated  by a disease resembling cholera morbus. The symptoms were first  dizziness, then great nausea, followed by vomiting and prolonged  purging, and in some cases delirium. A belt of country two or three  miles in width and several miles long was thus afflicted, beginning at  the west, the whole number of victims being estimated at from 1,200 to  1,500. No deaths are reported.    The cause of the epidemic is not known, but seems "]]]
