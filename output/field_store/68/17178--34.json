He had a church built called de brush house, dat had a flo' and  some seats, an' a top made outen pine boughs, an' massa's pa, Mr. Cato,  would preach eve'y Sunday. We sung songs lak 'I Heered De Voice of Jesus  Say,' an' 'I'se Gwine to Die no Mo.'

We had plenty som'n t'eat, but dem slaves hadda work  powerful hard though. Atter dey come home fum de fiel's dey was so tired  dat dey go raght to sleep, except when de massa had barbecues.

Prine_    Charity Anderson, who believes she is 101 years old, was born at Bell's  Landing on the Alabama River, where her owner, Leslie Johnson, operated  a wood-yard, which supplied fuel to the river steamers, and a tavern  where travelers whiled away the delays of a dubious riverboat schedule.    Rheumatic and weak, she no longer ventures from her house in  Toulminville, on the outskirts of Mobile, but sits, with her turbaned  head and bespectacled eyes, rocking the long hours away in a creaky old  chair and knitting or sewing, or just gazing into a past painted by the  crackling flames in the fireplace.    [Illustration: _Charity Anderson, Toulminville, Alabama_]    \"I has so much trouble gittin' up and down de steps and ober de groun',  I jist makes myself happy heah, cause--thank de Lawd--I'se on Zion's  March,\" is her resigned comment.    \"Missy, peoples don't live now; and niggers ain't got no manners, and  doan' know nothin' 'bout waitin' on folks. I kin remember de days w'en I  was one of de house servants. Dere was six of us in de ole Massa's  house--me, Sarai, Lou, Hester, Jerry and Joe. Us did'n' know nothin' but  good times den. My job was lookin' atter de corner table whar nothin'  but de desserts set. Joe and Jerry, dey was de table boys. Dey neber  tetched nothin' wid dere han's, but used de waiter to pass things wid.    \"My ole Massa was a good man. He treated all his slaves kind, and took  good kere of 'em. But, honey, all de white folks wan't good to dere  slaves. I's seen po' niggers 'mos' tore up by dogs and whupped 'tell dey  bled w'en dey did'n' do lak de white folks say. But, thank de Lawd, I  had good white folks and dey sho' did trus' me, too. I had charge of all  de keys to de house, and I waited on de Missis' and de chillun. I laid  out all de clo'se on Sat'dy night, and den Sunday mawnin's I'd pick up  all de dirty things. Dey did'n' have a thing to do. Us house servants  had a hahd job keepin' de pickaninnies out'er de dinin' room whar ole  Massa et, cause w'en dey would slip in and stan' by his cheer, w'en he  finished eatin' he would fix a plate for 'em and let 'em set on the  hearth.    \"No mam, Missy, I ain't neber worked in de fields. Ole Massa he neber  planted no cotton, and I ain't seen none planted 'tell after I was free.  But, honey, I could sho 'nuff wash, iron and knit and weave. Sometimes I  weaved six or seven yahds of cloth, and do my house work too. I lernt  the chillun how to weave, and wash, and iron, and knit too, and I's  waited on de fo'th generation of our fambly. I jes' wish I could tell  dese young chillun how to do. Iffen dey would only suffer me to talk to  dem, I'd tell dem to be more 'spectful to dere mammies and to dere white  folks and say 'yes mam' and 'no mam', instid of 'yes' and 'no' lek dey  do now.    \"All dis generation thinks of is 'musement. I neber had seen a show in  my whole life 'tell jes' dis pas' yeah when one of dem carnival things  wid de swings, and lights, and all de doin's dey have stop right in  front of our house heah.    \"And I ain't neber been in no trouble in all my life--ain't been in no  lawsuits, and ain't been no witness eben. I allus treat ebrybody as good  as I kin, and I uses my manners as good as I knows how, and de Lawd sho'  has took good keer of me. Why, w'en my house burnt up, de white folks  helped me so dat in no time you couldn't tell I ebber los' a thing.    \"But, honey, de good ole days is now gone foreber. De ole days was  railly de good times. How I wish I could go back to de days w'en we  lived at Johnson's landing on de riber, when de folks would come to  ketch de steamboats and we neber knowed how many to put on breakfas',  dinner or supper fo', cause de boats mought be behin' times. I ain't  neber had to pay a fare to ride a steamboat needer. I was a good lookin'  yaller gal in dem days and rid free wherever I wanted to go.    \"But whut's de use dreamin' 'bout de ole times?

Gus was telling about the investment of Eufaula during  the War between the States.    \"Gen'l Grierson and his men marched right through town,\" Gus went on  with his story of his boyhood. \"Mr. Lincoln done said we was free, but  us lil' niggers was too skeered to lissen to any ban' music, even iffen  the so'jers had come to set us free. 'Pears like us was allus gittin' in  somebody's way in dem days and gittin' skeered of somepin'. But we went  on away from the so'jers and had a good time 'mongst ourselves like we  always done when there wasn't any cotton pickin'. Cotton pickin' time  was when we didn't have any chance to do any playin'.    \"After the surrender I didn't have to do any more cotton pickin' and I  went blacksmithin' for Joe Sturgis. He was the first blacksmith in dis  here town. I was the second. Now my son done took on de work. They ain't  so much sence all dese here automobiles done got so plentiful and might  'nigh ruint de business. But for seventy years I riz wid de sun and went  to dat blacksmith shop. I's enjoying a little misery now; so I's takin'  my rest.\"    [Illustration: _Gus Askew, Eufaula, Alabama_]    Gus Askew was born a slave of the Edwards family in Henry County in  1853. He was brought to Eufaula just before the close of the war and  stayed on as a blacksmith after he was freed. In his seventy years of  hard work he saved enough to buy his home and some property which  maintains him and his wife since age and infirmity forced him to turn  over the work to his son. He has been married 54 years, numbers his  white friends by the hundreds and is held in great respect by his own  race.          Tom Baker          *Interview with Tom Baker*      --_Susie R.

De spring run down between some  willow trees an' it was powerful cool down dere in de shade. I use' to  lie on de moss an' let my bare belly git cool an' put my face in de  outlet of de spring an' let de water trickle over my haid. Jus' about de  time I gits a little rest one of dem niggers would call: 'Water boy!  Bring dat bucket!' Den I grab up de bucket an' run back out in de hot  sun.    \"One day, on my las' trip, I was mighty tired an' I flop down on dat  moss wid de sweat a-drippin' from my body, an' 'fo' I knowed it I done  fell slap to sleep. When I woke up, it was almos' dark, an' I couldn't  hear de slaves a-singing' in de fiel's, so I knowed dat dey had gone  home. I shake my haid, an' look about me, an' my eyes came to res' on a  little black bear cub a-drinkin' outen de spring. He so was a cute  little boogar an' I made up my mind right den to try an' kotch him. I  was jus' a little nigger 'bout ten year old an' didn't have no sense,  but I sho' wanted dat little bear.

I hear talk three or four of dem got converted in  de spirit dat night. I tellin you, it been a long time fore I got over  dat thing, too, 'cause I was scared most to death.    \"No'um, I never didn' believe in nothin like dat. Never didn' believe in  no conjurin. Don' care what dey say 'bout it, I never didn' believe in  it. Yes'um, I hear people talk 'bout somebody had hurt dem, but dey make  a wrong mistake to say somebody do somethin to dem. Ain' nobody but de  Lord do nothin, I say. I know dere ain' nobody never do nothin to me.

RFD*      --_G.L. Summer, Newberry, S.C._    \"Yes, I 'member slavery time and de war. I was about 7 or 8 years old. I  belonged to Marse Tom Price. My father, John James, belonged to Madison  Brooks and my mammy belonged to Tom Price. When dey married dey lived  wid Madison Brooks awhile, but dey was wid Tom Price when I was a boy.    \"Of cose I 'member de war. Us chaps, both niggers and white, was made to  go up-stairs in de big house and look out de window to see de soldiers  when dey come. We heard de Yankees marching befo' dey got dar, but dey  come from de other side of de house, facing south towards Caldwells, and  we didn't see dem marching in. Dey stopped at our house and looked  around and asked if marster was at home. We told him dat he wasn't dar.  We was eating apples, and dey asked us whar we got 'em. We told dem dat  we got de apples on de place, and dey asked us for some. We give dem  some apples; den dey left. Marse had carried his fine stock about a mile  off in de woods so de soldiers couldn't find dem; but we didn't tell de  soldiers.    \"We lived in a little log cabin made wid mud between de logs, dat was de  kind of houses Marse had for his slaves. We slept on wood beds wid ropes  stretched tight across in place of slats. Dis held our straw mattress.    \"My father's daddy come from Africa. His name was Emmanuel James. Atter  freedom come he give me a little yearling. We wasn't allowed to have  anything befo' freedom come; and we wasn't allowed to learn to read and  write. Dey whipped us if dey caught us wid a book trying to read or  write. Ma said dey cut off a hand if dey caught you.    \"We raised hogs, sheep, goats, cows and plenty chickens; raised  everything at home, and had a good garden with plenty vegetables. Dem  cows and hogs and other cattle were branded and allowed to graze around  in bottoms of de lowlands whar dar was no fence.    \"My clothes was made from yarn spun by my mammy, and she made my  clothes, too. Marse had my mammy to spin and weave for all de slaves on  de place. But marse and mistress was good to us. He had a nigger  overseer who sometimes brought a nigger to marse when he misbehaved; den  marse would have de nigger overseer to whip him. He had 8 to 10 slaves  all de time.    \"Some slaves dat lived on places close to us would run off sometimes and  hide in de woods, and live dar in a den which dey dug. At night they  would go out and hunt food, like hogs; den kill 'em at night and dress  'em. Most of de day dey would stay in de den.    \"I 'member when freedom come, old marse said, 'You is all free, but you  can work on and make dis crop of corn and cotton; den I will divide up  wid you when Christmas comes.' Dey all worked, and when Christmas come,  marse told us we could get on and shuffle for ourselves, and he didn't  give us anything. We had to steal corn out of de crib. We prized de ears  out between de cracks and took dem home and parched dem. We would have  to eat on dese for several days.    \"We had to work, all day, sun up to dark, and never had Saturday  afternoons off anytime. My mammy had to wash clothes on Saturday nights  for us to wear on Sundays.    \"We chaps played marbles most all de time. Marse used to try to scare us  by telling us dar was spooks. Some of de old folks did believe in  spooks, but I don't know much about dem. We never used much medicine den  but quinine. Folks had lots of chills den, but dey never had any kind of  strokes or things like dat as dey do dese days.    \"We had to get a pass from marse if we went out. If de patrollers caught  us widout a pass dey would whip us.    \"Right atter de war de Ku Klux started. I 'member dem when dey would  march up and down de road. Dey marched most at night, and we could hear  de horses for a long distance as deir feet struck de ground.    \"I married Nellie Wilson, and had 12 children. I got now 6 children; my  wife is dead. I got five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.    \"I think Abraham Lincoln and Jeff Davis was good men in deir way, as dey  thought. Booker T. Washington is a great man, and he is done lots of  good for de niggers. I think slavery was good in some ways and bad in  others. I was better off den dan I am now.    \"I jined de church when I was 20 years old, because it was de law--to  trust in de Lawd, you got to belong to de church.    \"I member something 'bout 40 acres of land and a mule dat de slaves  would get, but never come anything about it. When freedom come most of  de slaves hired out as wage hands, cutting wood and working on farms or  any odd jobs dey could get. Dar was lots of new ground, and many of de  niggers got work clearing it up.    \"We didn't get any money in slavery time, but got plenty to eat; and  atter de war, we got a little money and a little to eat. I 'member dat  old Mr. Brown hired me out once about 45 years ago at 30c a day and my  meals. I think de younger generation ain't so good. Dey have deir own  way and don't respect old folks. Dat's de way it is wid both whites and  blacks.\"          Isiah Jeffries          *Interview with Isiah Jefferies, (age 86)*      *Gaffney, S.C. Rt. 6.*      --_Caldwell Sims, Union, S.C._    \"I is what is known as a outside child. My Ma went to Hamlet. I lived on  de Jefferies plantation, below Wilkinsville in Cherokee County. My  father was Henry Jefferies. My mother was Jane Jefferies. My mother's  husband was named Ned. Before her marriage she was a Davis. She was sold  in slavery to Henry Jefferies. I allus lived with my mother, and Ned was  as good to me as he was to his own chillun. My mother had three outside  chilluns, and we each had a different father. Atter she married Ned; den  he jest come to be our Pa, dat is he let her give us his name. She and  Ned had four chillun.    \"My first wife is dead and my second wife is named Alice Jefferies. I  got one child by my first wife, and I ain't got no outside chilluns. Dat  works out bad, at best. None of my folks is living. All of dem is done  dead now; jest me, my wife and my sister's daughter, Emma, who is grown  now. Her Pa and her Ma took and went crazy befo' dey died. Both of dem  died in de asylum. We took Emma, and she ain't jest 'zactly right; but  she ain't no bother to us.    \"First thing I had to do as a child was to mind my Ma's other chilluns  as I was de first outside one dat she had. Dis I did until I was about  twelve years old. My Ma and Ned was working one day and I was minding  her chilluns as usual when I looked up and seed de top of our house on  fire. I hollered and dey come running from de field. De other hands come  with dem kaise I made such a noise hollering. Soon de big folks got de  fire out. Atter dat, Marse Henry had me to leave de house and go to work  fer him.    \"It was spring and I started in chopping cotton. 'Peers dat I got on  pretty well, and dat de overseer liked me from de start. From dar on I  was broke into field work of all kinds and den I did work around de lot  as well. It was not long befo' everybody started calling me 'uncle  Zery', why--I did not know; but anyway dat name still sticks to me by  dem dat knows me well. My grandpa never called me dat, kaise I was named  atter him, and he too proud of dat fact to call me any nickname. I  stayed wid him at his house lots atter I started working fer de marster,  kaise he showed me how to do things. I worked fer him to git my first  money and he would give me a quarter fer a whole day's work. Dat made me  feel good and I thought I was a man kaise I made a quarter. In dem days  a quarter was a lot of money. I spent it fer chawing tobacco, and dat  made me sick at first. Dats all men had to spend money fer in dem days.  Everything was give you on de plantation and you did not need much  money. Sometimes we cooked out in de field and I have cooked bread in de  field in a lid.    \"Ma teached me how to cook befo' I was twelve years old. We had good  things to eat den; more dan my chilluns has dese times. All de slaves  had dere gardens on my marster's plantation. He made dem do it, and dey  liked it. Niggers do not seem to take no pains wid gardens now. Land  ain't soft and mellow like it used to be. In cold weather we had to bank  out 'taters, rutabegas, beets, carrots and pumpkins. De pumpkins and  carrots was fer de hogs and cows.    \"In warm"]]]
