The same applies to \"fur farming.\" The person who has followed  hunting and trapping or the farmer who has given attention to fur  bearing animals are the ones most apt to be successful.    Foxes, no doubt, will be the animals that the majority would like to  begin with, especially the more valuable species, as black, silver and  cross. These for breeding purposes of course can be secured, but the  present raisers do not seem to care to sell any of their stock unless at  good round figures. They want to further increase their own numbers.    A good many attempts were made at raising skunk a few years ago, most of  which were failures. Some entered the business on a large scale, knowing  nothing of the animal, and of course failed; others \"penned up\" a few  skunk and as they were not properly cared for resulted in failures.    The recent advanced price for skunk skins has caused a revival in their  raising. This time, an entirely different class of people are taking up  their raising, and they are going to succeed, why? Because they know  something of the animal and are going at the business in a calm and  business-like way.    Mink, at present prices, look good to the fur-farmer. They are small  animals but yield a pelt worth from $3 to $7, depending upon the size  and color. Raccoon and opossum are compared with many fur-bearing  animals as producers of cheap furs. This is true, but at the same time,  they offer the most promising future for the fur-farmer in many  localities. They are easily raised, and in addition to their fur, the  carcass finds a ready sale in most cities.    Opossum and coon will not dig deep seeking escape, but are good climbers  and considerable precaution should be taken to see that the wire netting  is either extended in several feet at the top, or that a strip of tin a  couple of feet wide is fastened to the posts some three feet from the  ground.    The \"fur-farmer,\" should the market be low for certain animals, can keep  over; or the better plan would no doubt be to kill off the surplus  males and perhaps some females. At such times do not make the mistake of  killing off too closely, as some will do, claiming that the fur is low  and that there is no need of trying to increase. Nine times in ten, this  is the time to raise as many as possible, for by another season, that  particular article is apt to be in demand.    To illustrate: skunk were low in 1907, yet had the raisers gone ahead,  they would have had a supply to kill during the Winter of 1908-9, at  prices that were indeed satisfactory.    Had the opossum raiser, during the low prices for this fur in 1907 and  1908, sold off his breeding stock at low prices, as he would have been  compelled to do, he would not had a supply when the prices advanced in  January, 1909.    Some farmers make the mistake of selling off all their stock when prices  ease up, expecting to go into the raising again when a reaction takes  place. This is not the way to make the most money; when a reaction  comes, other farmers who have continued raising this certain animal,  reap the harvest, selling to the market or to their neighbors at high  prices.    The prices paid for the various articles shows about what the grower may  expect for his \"crop.\" The demand, of course, will have much to do with  the price. Fashion is constantly changing but indications are that  owing to diminishing supply and increased consumption, prices will be on  a fairly high level always. Trappers and hunters often catch fur too  early and as a consequence have blue pelts which are graded down. In the  spring shedders and rubbed skins are secured which are sold as No. 2 or  lower. With the \"fur farmer,\" there will be no early caught blue skins  or late caught spring and shedders. The animals will be killed when  \"prime,\" and will bring best prices.    Some reports from those that have experimented in a small way at raising  fur animals is to the effect that they do not fur properly. This is true  in regard skunk, when kept in a box or a small enclosure for weeks and  fed largely on meat. The writer when a fur buyer has bought skunk that  had been kept in a \"pen\" or small enclosure for weeks and in addition to  being thinly furred, the hide was much thicker than it should have been.    Indians and professional hunters and trappers of the north say that they  can notice a difference in the fur of foxes, lynx, marten, etc., when  the food supply is abundant. The fur is thicker and has a healthier,  silkier and glossier appearance. The secret, no doubt, is to give the  animals plenty of room and feed should be varied. Here is where the  person who knows the habits of the animal or animals he is raising is  valuable. When cattle, sheep and hogs are fed properly they take on fat  readily and produce a healthy coat of hair or wool. The same applies to  the fur bearing animals.    What animals offer the best inducement to raise? This is a question that  each individual going into the business must largely decide. The place  you have in view for the starting of the \"farm\" will have much to do  with this. Is the location one best adapted to skunk, mink, coon, fox,  muskrat or some other fur bearer? Again, your experience should be taken  into consideration,--what fur bearers you are most familiar with. If you  live near a large city which offers a market for coon and opossum  carcasses, this should be considered as these animals are easy to raise  and opossum especially are very prolific, producing from six to twelve  at a litter. While the fur of coon and opossum will never be very  valuable, yet, as both fur and carcass have a cash value, they will  prove greater money makers than many believe. Muskrat are another animal  that should not be overlooked as they increase rapidly and their flesh  is now being sold in many of the larger cities.    Marten and silver fox should not be raised in the south, as these are  animals that do best in the cold sections. Otter and mink are two  animals that the sun fades the fur and as the darker the fur, the more  valuable, it is important that as little sun as possible shines upon  them. For this reason it is advisable to have the enclosure for these  animals in the woods or thicket. In fact some trees should be in  enclosures for all animals. If raising coon or opossum, they will be \"at  home\" in the trees while other animals will enjoy the shade in the  summer and will make use of the leaves in the dens for winter.    [Illustration: Enclosure in thick woods.]    There are some animals such as marten, fisher, wild cat, weasel, badger  and wolves that do not seem promising to us to raise for various  reasons. Marten do best in the high mountain sections; fisher and wild  cat would be hard to keep in an inclosure; weasel and badger are not  valuable and would both be difficult to keep in; wolves are not valuable  for fur and would require considerable attention and food, hence, not  desirable to raise. In most states there is a bounty on wolf and coyote  scalps but the raising of them for the purpose of the bounty would not  work--the bounty would not be paid if county officials knew from what  source they came.    Among the animals promising the best for raising are the black, silver,  cross and red fox, skunk, mink, coon, opossum and muskrat. The otter,  beaver, bear and lynx under certain conditions may be well worth  considering, especially lynx at present value.    Do you think present prices for furs will continue? Generally speaking,  yes. In fact, some articles are liable to go higher. On the other hand  some furs may go lower but are sure to sooner or later react. The  chances are that raw furs will not soon sell at the low figures of past  years.    Suppose thousands engaged in the business of raising fox, skunk, mink,  coon, opossum and muskrat, what effect would it have upon the market?  Would they overstock it? How many hundreds of thousands of persons are  today raising cotton and wool to furnish clothing to the millions of  people and there has always been a market. The same will be the case  with fur. In fact, unless thousands engage in the fur raising business,  the demand is going to far exceed the supply at no distant day.    Furs in the north are a necessity as no cloth will repel the piercing  winds. Teamsters and others much out of doors wear fur overcoats, caps  and use fur laprobes. Farther south, say in the latitude of New York,  Pittsburg, Denver, etc., while furs are not an absolute necessity, yet  they are much worn for comfort. In all the cities of the north, furs are  worn eight or nine months in the year; in the central sections perhaps  six months; while in the south only a few months. In addition to this,  American furs are worn in all civilized countries of the world.    The farmer or stock raiser, as a rule, who is making the most money, is  the one who raises not horses, cattle, sheep or swine alone, but often  two or more of them. The same can be applied to fur farming. Suppose an  enclosure of a few acres is made for skunk, why not take in a pond and  raise muskrat, coon, fish and frogs. There is a ready market in all  cities for fresh fish and frogs.    The farmer that raises sheep not only sells the wool but fattens and  sells some of the lambs, wethers or old ewes from time to time. The  farmer is in the business to make the most out of it and such will be  the case with the fur farmer. In the cities there is a demand for the  carcasses of coon and opossum at prices ranging from 25 to 75 cents for  coon and 10 to 50 cents for opossum, depending upon the size of the  carcass, as well as the city in which you are marketing. In New York,  Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, there is a ready sale for all coon and  opossum carcasses at good prices. Other cities that use large quantities  are Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburg, Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee.

But a change, far more important than mere skin-shifting, follows close  upon the animal's caterpillar-maturity, complete as soon as it ceases to  grow.    The form and habits of a worm are to be exchanged for the glories and  pleasures of winged life; but this can only be done at the price of passing  through an intermediate state; one neither of eating, nor of flying, but  motionless, helpless and death-like. {12}    This is called the CHRYSALIS _or_ PUPA _state_.    _Pupa_ is a Latin word, signifying a creature swathed, or tied up; and is  applied to this stage of all insects, because all, or some, of their parts  are then bound up, as if swathed.    The term _Chrysalis_ is applicable to butterflies only, and, strictly, only  to a few of these--_Chrysalis_[1] being derived from the Greek [Greek:  chrusos] (_chrysos_), _gold_--in allusion to the splendid gilding of the  surface in certain species, such as the _Vanessas_, Fritillaries, and some  others.    In the older works on entomology we frequently meet with the term _Aurelia_  applied to this state, and having the same meaning as chrysalis, but  derived from the Latin word _Aurum_, gold.    Here the reader is again referred to Plate I. for a series of the principal  forms assumed by the chrysalides of our native butterflies, and as these  for the most part represent the next stage of the caterpillars previously  figured, an opportunity is afforded of tracing the insect's form through  its three great changes; the whole of the butterflies in their perfect  state being given in their proper places in the body of the work.    [Illustration: III.]    {13} The complicated and curious processes by which various caterpillars  assume the chrysalis form, and suspend themselves securely in their proper  attitudes, have been most accurately and laboriously chronicled by the  French naturalist, Reaumur; but his memoirs on the subject, which have been  frequently quoted into the larger entomological works, are too long for  insertion here in full, and any considerable abbreviation would fail to  convey a clear idea of the process, on account of the intricacy of the  operations described. So I can only here allude to the difficult problems  that the creature has to solve, referring the reader to the above-mentioned  works for a detailed description of the manner of doing so; or, better  still, I would recommend the country resident to witness all this with his  own eyes. By keeping a number of the caterpillars of our common  butterflies, feeding them up, and attentively watching them when  full-grown, he will now and then detect one in the transformation act, and  have an opportunity of wondering at the curious manoeuvres of the animal,  as it triumphs over seeming impossibilities.    By reference to the figures of chrysalides on Plate I. it will be seen that  there are two distinct modes of suspension employed among them; one, by the  tail only, the head hanging down freely in the air:--in the other, the tail  is attached to the supporting object; but the head, instead of swinging  loosely, is kept in an upright position by being looped round the waist  with a silken girdle.    To appreciate the difficulty of gaining either of the above positions, we  must bear in mind that, before doing so, the caterpillar has to throw off  its own skin, carrying with it the whole of its legs, and the jaws {14}  too--leaving itself a mere limbless, and apparently helpless mass--its only  prehensile organs being a few minute, almost imperceptible hooks on the end  of the tail; and the required position of attachment and security is  accomplished by a series of movements so dexterous and sleight-of-hand  like, as to cause infinite astonishment to the looker-on, and, as Reaumur  justly observes, \"It is impossible not to wonder, that an insect, which  executes them but once in its life, should execute them so well. We must  necessarily conclude that it has been instructed by a GREAT MASTER; for He  who has rendered it necessary for the insect to undergo this change, has  likewise given it all the requisite means for accomplishing it in safety.\"    If we examine a chrysalis we are able to make out, through the thin  envelope, all the external organs of the body stowed away in the most  orderly and compact manner. The antennae are very conspicuous, folded down  alongside of the legs; and precisely in the centre will be seen the tongue,  unrolled and forming a straight line between the legs. The unexpanded wings  are visible on each side--very small, but with all their veinings  distinctly seen; and the breathing holes, called spiracles, are placed in a  row on each side of the body.    The duration of the chrysalis stage, like that of the egg, is extremely  variable, and dependent on difference of temperature. As an instance of  this, one of our common butterflies has been known to pass only seven {15}  or eight days in the chrysalis state; this would be in the heat of summer.  Then, in the spring, the change occupies a fortnight; but when the  caterpillar enters the chrysalis state in the autumn, the butterfly does  not make its appearance till the following spring. Furthermore, it has been  proved by experiment, that if the condition of perpetual winter be kept up  by keeping the chrysalis in an icehouse, its development may be retarded  for two or three years beyond its proper time; while, on the other hand, if  in the middle of winter the chrysalis be removed to a hothouse, the  enclosed butterfly, mistaking the vivifying warmth for returning summer,  makes its _debut_ in ten days or a fortnight.           *       *       *       *       *      {16}    CHAPTER II.        \"COMING OUT\"--ICHNEUMONS--THE BUTTERFLY PERFECTED--ITS      WINGS--LEPIDOPTERA--MEANING OF THE WORD--MICROSCOPIC VIEW--NEW      BEAUTIES--MAGNIFIED \"DUST\"--THE HEAD AND ITS ORGANS--THE TONGUE--THE      EYES--THE ANTENNAE--THEIR USES--INSECT CLAIRVOYANCE--AN UNKNOWN      SENSE--FORMS OF ANTENNAE--THE LEGS.    We now arrive at the last stage, the consummation of all this strange  series of transformations; for veritable transformations they are to all  intents and purposes; though some learned naturalists have discovered--or  imagined so--that the butterfly, in all its parts, really lies hid under  the caterpillar's skin, and can be distinguished under microscopical  dissection; and that, therefore, the so-called transformations are merely  the throwing off of the various envelopes or husks, as they become in turn  superfluous, as a mountebank strips off garment after garment, till lastly  the sparkling harlequin is discovered to view; or, in more exact language,  they consider these changes in the light rather of successive developments  and emancipations of the various organs than as their actual  transformations. Still, it seems to me, the difference is chiefly one of  terms. The real wondrous fact remains undiminished and {17} unexplained;  that a creeping wormlike creature, in process of time, is changed into a  glorious winged being, differing from the former in form, habits, food, and  every essential particular, as widely as any two creatures can well differ,  as widely as a serpent from a bird, for instance.    As the imprisoned butterfly approaches maturity, a change is observable in  the exterior of the chrysalis, the skin becomes dry and brittle, usually  darkens in colour, and if the enclosed butterfly be a strongly marked one,  the pattern of its wings shows through, often quite distinctly.    When the fulness of time arrives, the creature breaks through its thin  casings, which divide in several places, and the freed insect crawls up  into some convenient spot to dry itself, and allow the wings to expand.    All the organs are at first moist and tender, but on exposure to the air  soon acquire strength and firmness.    At the moment of emergence, the wings are very miniature affairs, sometimes  hardly one-twentieth of their full size when expanded; but so rapid is  their increase in volume, that they may actually be seen to grow, as the  fluids from the body are pumped into the nervures that support the  wing-membrane, and keep it extended.    In the more strongly marked, or richly coloured species, it is a  wonderfully beautiful sight to watch this expansion of the wings, and to  see the various features {18} of their painted devices growing under the  eye and developing gradually into their true proportions.    Generally within an hour the development is complete, and the wings, having  gained their full expanse and consistency by drying in the sun, are ready  for flight, and the glad creature wings his way to the fields of air, and  enters on that life of sunshine and hilarity which is associated with the  very name of \"_Butterfly_.\"    But not every chrysalis arrives at this happy consummation of its  existence. Supposing that you have reared and watched a caterpillar to  apparently healthy maturity, that it has duly become a chrysalis, and you  are awaiting its appearance in butterfly splendour--peeping into your box  some morning to see if the bright expected one is \"out,\" be not surprised  if in its stead you find the box tenanted by a swarm of little black  flies--an impish-looking crew. Whence came all these? Why they and the  empty chrysalis shell are all that remains of your cherished prize; so look  no more for the fair sunny butterfly, devoured ere born by that  ill-favoured troop of darklings who have just now issued from the lifeless  shell.    The truth is, that long since, perhaps in early larva-hood, the creature's  fate was sealed; a deadly enemy to his race is ever on the alert, winging  about in the shape of a small black fly, in search of an exposed and  defenceless caterpillar. Having selected her victim, she pierces his body  with a sharp cutting instrument she is armed with, and in the wound  deposits an egg;"]]]
