Generally, these geographical variations, as they are called, are the  result of climatic conditions. For instance, in regions of heavy  rainfall a bird's colors are usually much darker than they are where  the rainfall is light. Song Sparrows, for example, are palest in the  desert region of Arizona, where the annual rainfall may not reach  eight inches, and darkest on the coast of British Columbia and Alaska,  where the annual rainfall may be over one hundred inches. In going  from one region, however, to the other the gradual changes in climate  are accompanied by gradual changes in the colors of the Song Sparrows,  and the wide differences between Arizona and Alaska Song Sparrows are  therefore bridged by a series of intermediates.    Variations of this kind are spoken of as geographic, racial, or  subspecific and the birds exhibiting them are termed subspecies. In  naming them a third name, or trinomial is employed, and the  possession of such a name indicates at once that a bird is a  geographic or racial representative of a species, with one or more  representatives of which it intergrades.    Returning now to the Robin. Our eastern Robins always have the outer  pair of tail-feathers tipped with white and, in adults, the back is  blotched with black; while Robins from the Rocky Mountains and  westward have little or no white on the outer tail-feathers, and the  back is dark gray, without black blotches. These extremes are  connected by intermediate specimens sharing the characters; of both  eastern and western birds. We do not, therefore, treat the latter as a  species, but as a subspecies, and consequently, apply to it a  subspecific name or trinomial, _Planesticus migratorius propinquus_,  (_propinquus_, meaning nearly related.)    A further study of our eastern Robin shows that in the southern parts  of its breeding range (the Carolinas and Georgia), it varies from the  northern type in being smaller in size and much paler and duller in  color; and to this second geographical variety is applied the name  _Planesticus migratorius achrusterus_, (_achrusterus_, meaning less  highly colored).    After the recognition of western and southern races of the Robin under  three names (trinomial) it would obviously be inconsistent to apply  only two names (binomial) to our eastern bird, the former being no  more subspecies of the latter than the latter is of the former. In  other words, to continue to apply only generic and specific names to  the Eastern Robin would imply that it was a full species, while the  use of a trinomial for the Western or the Southern Robin shows them to  be subspecies. As a matter of fact we know that there is but one  species of true Robin in the United States, consequently in accordance  with the logical and now generally accepted method, we apply to that  species the name _Planesticus migratorius_, and this is equally  applicable to Robins from east, south or west. When, however, we learn  that the Eastern Robin is not a species but a subspecies, we repeat  the specific name by which it was made known and call it _Planesticus  migratorius migratorius_.    It may be asked, Why give names to these geographical races? Why not  call Eastern, Western and Southern Robins by one name, _Planesticus  migratorius_, without regard to their climatic variations?    In reply, two excellent reasons may be given for the recognition of  subspecies by name; first, because in some cases they differ from one  another far more than do many species, when it would clearly be  inadvisable to apply the same name to what are obviously different  creatures. For example, it has lately been discovered by Mr. E. W.  Nelson that the small, black-throated, brown-breasted, Quails or  Bob-whites of southern Mexico, through a long series of intermediates  inhabiting the intervening region, intergrade with the large,  white-throated, black-and-white breasted, Bob-white of our northern  states. It would be absurd to call such wholly unlike birds by the  same name, nor could we give a full specific name to the Mexican  Bob-white since at no place can we draw a line definitely separating  it from the northern Bob-white. Furthermore, the use of only two names  would conceal the remarkable fact of the intergradation of two such  strikingly different birds; a fact of the first importance to students  of the evolution of species.    For much the same reason we should name those birds which show less  pronounced variations, such as are exhibited by the Robin. Here we  have a species in the making, and in tracing the relation between  cause and effect, we learn something of the influences which create  species. Thus, climate has been definitely proven so to alter a  species, both in size and color that, as we have seen in the case of  the Song Sparrows, marked climate changes are accompanied by  correspondingly marked changes in the appearance of certain animals.  In naming these animals we are, in effect, giving a 'handle to the  fact' of their evolution by environment.    Since it is evident that a bird may vary much or little, according to  the governing conditions and its tendency to respond to them, no fixed  rule can be laid down which shall decide just what degree of  difference are deserving a name. It follows, therefore, that in some  cases ornithologists do not agree upon a bird's claim to subspecific  rank.    In North America, however, questions of this kind are referred to a  committee of seven experts of the American Ornithologists' Union, and  their decision establishes a nomenclature, which is accepted as the  standard by other American ornithologists and which has been adopted  in this volume.    Foreign birds of wholly accidental occurrence, most of which have been  found in North America but once or twice, are included in the  systematic list of North American birds, but are not described or  figured in the body of the book, where their presence would tend to  convey an erroneous impression of their North American status.  Furthermore, records of the presence of birds so rare as these can be  properly based on only the capture of specimens.    In the preparation of the following pages both author and artist have  had full access to the collections of the American Museum of Natural  History, and they are also glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to  William Brewster of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Robert Ridgway,  Curator of Birds in the United States National Museum, and to C. Hart  Merriam, Chief of the Biologic Survey, for the loan of specimens for  description and illustration.          SYNOPSIS OF ORDERS AND FAMILIES OF NORTH  AMERICAN BIRDS.

Many fossils indeed merit their popular appellation of petrifactions,  because they have been changed into stone by the slow removal of the  animal or vegetable matter present and its replacement by some mineral,  usually silica or some form of lime. But it is necessary to include  'indications of plants or animals' in the above definition because some  of the best fossils may be merely impressions of plants or animals and  no portion of the objects themselves, and yet, as we shall see, some of  our most important information has been gathered from these same  imprints.    Nearly all our knowledge of the plants that flourished in the past is  based on the impressions of their leaves left on the soft mud or smooth  sand that later on hardened into enduring stone. Such, too, are the  trails of creeping and crawling things, casts of the burrows of worms  and the many footprints of the reptiles, great and small, that crept  along the shore or stalked beside the waters of the ancient seas. The  creatures themselves have passed away, their massive bones even are  lost, but the prints of their feet are as plain to-day as when they were  first made.    Many a crustacean, too, is known solely or mostly by the cast of its  shell, the hard parts having completely vanished, and the existence of  birds in some formations is revealed merely by the casts of their eggs;  and these natural casts must be included in the category of fossils.    Impressions of vertebrates may, indeed, be almost as good as actual  skeletons, as in the case of some fishes, where the fine mud in which  they were buried has become changed to a rock, rivalling porcelain in  texture; the bones have either dissolved away or shattered into dust at  the splitting of the rock, but the imprint of each little fin-ray and  every threadlike bone is as clearly defined as it would have been in a  freshly prepared skeleton. So fine, indeed, may have been the mud, and  so quiet for the time being the waters of the ancient sea or lake, that  not only have prints of bones and leaves been found, but those of  feathers and of the skin of some reptiles, and even of such soft and  delicate objects as jelly fishes. But for these we should have little  positive knowledge of the outward appearance of the creatures of the  past, and to them we are occasionally indebted for the solution of some  moot point in their anatomy.    The reader may possibly wonder why it is that fossils are not more  abundant; why, of the vast majority of animals that have dwelt upon the  earth since it became fit for the habitation of living beings, not a  trace remains. This, too, when some objects--the tusks of the Mammoth,  for example--have been sufficiently well preserved to form staple  articles of commerce at the present time, so that the carved handle of  my lady's parasol may have formed part of some animal that flourished at  the very dawn of the human race, and been gazed upon by her  grandfather a thousand times removed. The answer to this query is that,  unless the conditions were such as to preserve at least the hard parts  of any creature from immediate decay, there was small probability of its  becoming fossilized. These conditions are that the objects must be  protected from the air, and, practically, the only way that this happens  in nature is by having them covered with water, or at least buried in  wet ground.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Diplomystus, an Ancient Member of the Shad  Family. From the Fishbed at Green River, Wyoming. _From a specimen in  the United States National Museum._]    If an animal dies on dry land, where its bones lie exposed to the  summer's sun and rain and the winter's frost and snow, it does not take  these destructive agencies long to reduce the bones to powder; in the  rare event of a climate devoid of rain, mere changes of temperature, by  producing expansion and contraction, will sooner or later cause a bone  to crack and crumble.    Usually, too, the work of the elements is aided by that of animals and  plants. Every one has seen a dog make way with a pretty good-sized bone,  and the Hyena has still greater capabilities in that line; and ever  since vertebrate life began there have been carnivorous animals of some  kind to play the role of bone-destroyers. Even were there no carnivores,  there were probably then, as now, rats and mice a-plenty, and few  suspect the havoc small rodents may play with a bone for the grease it  contains, or merely for the sake of exercising their teeth. Now and then  we come upon a fossil bone, long since turned into stone, on which are  the marks of the little cutting teeth of field mice, put there long,  long ago, and yet looking as fresh as if made only last week. These  little beasts, however, are indirect rather than direct agents in the  destruction of bones by gnawing off the outer layers, and thus  permitting the more ready entrance of air and water. Plants, as a rule,  begin their work after an object has become partly or entirely buried in  the soil, when the tiny rootlets find their way into fissures, and,  expanding as they grow, act like so many little wedges to force it  asunder.    Thus on dry land there is small opportunity for a bone to become a  fossil; but, if a creature so perishes that its body is swept into the  ocean or one of its estuaries, settles to the muddy bottom of a lake or  is caught on the sandy shoals of some river, the chances are good that  its bones will be preserved. They are poorest in the ocean, for unless  the body drifts far out and settles down in quiet waters, the waves  pound the bones to pieces with stones or scour them away with sand,  while marine worms may pierce them with burrows, or echinoderms cut  holes for their habitations; there are more enemies to a bone than one  might imagine.    Suppose, however, that some animal has sunk in the depths of a quiet  lake, where the wash of the waves upon the shore wears the sand or rock  into mud so fine that it floats out into still water and settles there  as gently as dew upon the grass. Little by little the bones are covered  by a deposit that fills every groove and pore, preserving the mark of  every ridge and furrow; and while this may take long, it is merely a  matter of time and favorable circumstance to bury the bones as deeply as  one might wish. Scarce a reader of these lines but at some time has cast  anchor in some quiet pond and pulled it up, thickly covered with sticky  mud, whose existence would hardly be suspected from the sparkling waters  and pebbly shores. If, instead of a lake, our animal had gone to the  bottom of some estuary into which poured a river turbid with mud, the  process of entombment would have been still more rapid, while, had the  creature been engulfed in quicksand, it would have been the quickest  method of all; and just such accidents did take place in the early days  of the earth as well as now. At least two examples of the great Dinosaur  Thespesius have been found with the bones all in place, the thigh bones  still in their sockets and the ossified tendons running along the  backbone as they did in life. This would hardly have happened had not  the body been surrounded and supported so that every part was held in  place and not crushed, and it is difficult to see any better agency for  this than burial in quicksand.    If such an event as we have been supposing took place in a part of the  globe where the land was gradually sinking--and the crust of the earth  is ever rising and falling--the mud and sand would keep on accumulating  until an enormously thick layer was formed. The lime or silica contained  in the water would tend to cement the particles of mud and grains of  sand into a solid mass, while the process would be aided by the pressure  of the overlying sediment, the heat created by this pressure, and that  derived from the earth beneath. During this process the animal matter of  bones or other objects would disappear and its place be taken by lime or  silica, and thus would be formed a layer of rock containing fossils. The  exact manner in which this replacement is effected and in which the  chemical and mechanical changes occur is very far from being definitely  known--especially as the process of \"fossilization\" must at times have  been very complicated.    In the case of fossil wood greater changes have taken place than in the  fossilization of bone, for there is not merely an infiltration of the  specimen but a complete replacement of the original vegetable by mineral  matter, the interior of the cells being first filled with silica and  their walls replaced later on. So completely and minutely may this  change occur that under the microscope the very cellular structure of  the wood is visible, and as this varies according to the species, it is  possible, by microscopical examination, to determine the relationship of  trees in cases where nothing but fragments of the trunk remain.    The process of fossilization is at best a slow one, and soft substances  such as flesh, or even horn, decay too rapidly for it to take place, so  that all accounts of petrified bodies, human or otherwise, are either  based on deliberate frauds or are the result of a very erroneous  misinterpretation of facts. That the impression or cast of a body  _might_ be formed in nature, somewhat as casts have been made of those  who perished at Pompeii, is true; but, so far, no authentic case of the  kind has come to light, and the reader is quite justified in  disbelieving any report of \"a petrified man.\"    Natural casts of such hard bodies as shells are common, formed by the  dissolving away of the original shell after it had become enclosed in  mud, or even after this had changed to stone, and the filling up of this  space by the filtering in of water charged with lime or silica, which  is there deposited, often in crystalline form. In this way, too, are  formed casts of eggs of"]]]
