The adjustment of  limits is a frequent cause of legal contention; and the subject of art  now under discussion, may be considered like a dispute concerning  boundaries. It may often admit of doubt whether a particular artist  approaches more nearly to the class of merit or of insignificance; which  is, in other words, whether he should or should not obtain a place in a  history of the art. Under such uncertainty, which I have several times  encountered, I have more usually inclined to the side of lenity than of  severity; especially when the artist has been noticed with a degree of  commendation by former authors. We ought to bow to public opinion, which  rarely blames us for noticing mediocrity, but frequently for passing it  over in silence. Books on painting abound with complaints against  Orlandi and Guarienti, for their omissions of certain artists. Still  more frequently are authors censured, when the Guide to a city points  out some altar-piece by a native artist, who is not named in our  Dictionaries of Painting. The describers of collections repeat similar  complaints in regard to every painting bearing the signature of an  artist whose name appears in no work of art. Collectors of prints do the  same when they discover the name of some designer, of whom history is  silent, affixed to an engraving. Thus, were we to consult the opinion of  the public, the majority would be inclined to recommend copiousness,  rather than to express satisfaction at a more discriminating selection  of names. Almost all artists and amateurs belonging to every city, would  be desirous that I should commemorate as many of their second rate  painters as possible; and our selection, therefore, in this respect,  nearly resembles the exercise of justice, which is generally applauded  as long as it visits only the dwellings of others, but is cried down by  each individual when it knocks at his own door. Thus a writer who is  bound to observe impartiality towards every city, can scarcely shew  great severity to artists of mediocrity in any. This too is not without  reason; for to pass mediocrity in silence may be the study of a good  orator, but not the office of a good historian. Cicero himself, in his  treatise _De claris Oratoribus_, has given a place to less eloquent  orators, and it may be observed that, after this example, the literary  history of every people does not merely include its most classic  writers, and those who approached nearest to them; but it adds short and  concise accounts of authors less celebrated; and in the Iliad, which is  a history of the heroic age, there are a few eminent leaders, many  valiant soldiers, and a prodigious crowd of others, whom the poet has  transiently noticed. In our case, it is still more incumbent on the  historian to give mediocrity a place along with the eminent and most  excellent. Many books describe that class in terms so vague, and  sometimes so discordant, that to form a proper estimate of their claims,  we must introduce them among superior artists, as a sort of performers  in third-rate parts. Such, however, I am not solicitous to exhibit very  minutely, more especially when treating of painters in fresco, and  generally of other artists, whose works are now unknown in collections,  or add more to the bulk than the ornament of a gallery. Thus also in  point of number, my work has maintained the character of a compendium:  but if any of my readers, adopting the rigid maxim of Bellori, that, in  the fine arts, as in poetry, mediocrity is not to be tolerated,[11]  should disdain the middle class of artists, he must look for the heads  of schools, and for the most eminent painters: to these he may dedicate  his attention, and turn his regard from the others like one,      \"Cui altra cura stringa e morda    Che quella di colui che gli e davante.\"[12]    Having described my plan, let us next consider the three objects  originally proposed, of which the first was to present Italy with a  history that may prove important to her fame. This delightful country is  already indebted to Tiraboschi for a history of her literature, but she  is still in want of a history of her arts. The history of painting, an  art in which she is confessedly without a rival, I propose to supply, or  at least to facilitate the attempt. In some departments of literature,  and of the fine arts, we are equalled, or even surpassed by foreigners;  and in others the palm is yet doubtful: but in painting, universal  consent now yields the triumph to Italian genius, and foreigners are the  more esteemed in proportion to their approach towards us. It is time  then, for the honour of Italy, to collect in one point of view, those  observations on her painting, scattered through upwards of a hundred  volumes, and to embody them in what Horace terms _series et junctura_;  without which the work cannot be pronounced a history. I will not  conceal, that the author of the \"History of Italian Literature\"  above mentioned, frequently animated me to this undertaking, as a sequel  to his own work. He also wished me to subjoin other anecdotes to those  already published, and to substitute more authentic documents for the  inaccuracies abounding in our Dictionaries of painting. I have attended  to both these objects. The reader will here find various schools never  hitherto illustrated, and an entire school, that of Ferrara, now first  described from the manuscripts of Baruffaldi and of Crespi; and in other  schools he will often observe names of fresh artists, which I have  either collected from ancient MSS.[13] and the correspondence of my  learned friends, or deciphered on old paintings. Although such pictures  are confined to cabinets, it cannot prove useless to extend a more  intimate acquaintance with their authors. The reader will also meet with  many new observations on the origin of painting, and on its diffusion in  Italy, formerly a fruitful subject of debate and contention; and  likewise here and there with some original reflections on the masters,  to whom various disciples may be traced; a branch of history, the most  uncertain of any. Old writers of respectability often mention Raffaello,  Correggio, or some other celebrated artist, as the master of a painter,  without any better foundation than a similarity of style; just as the  credulous heathens imagined one hero to be the son of Hercules, because  he was strong; another of Mercury, because he was ingenious; a third of  Neptune, because he had performed several long voyages. Errors like  these are easily corrected when they are accompanied by some  inadvertency in the writer; as for instance, where he has not been aware  that the age of the disciple does not correspond with that of his  supposed master. Occasionally, however, their detection is attended with  more difficulty; and in particular when the artist, whose reputation is  wholly founded upon that of his master, represented himself in foreign  parts, as the disciple of men of celebrity, whom he scarcely knew by  sight. Of this we have an example in Agostino Tassi, and more recently  in certain _soidisant_ disciples of Mengs; to whom it scarcely appears  that he ever so much as said, \"_Gentlemen, how do you do_?\"    Finally, the reader will find some less obvious notices relating to the  name, the country, and the age of different artists. The deficiency of  our Dictionaries in interesting names, together with their inaccuracy,  are common subjects of complaint. I can excuse the compilers of these  works; I know how easily we may be misled in regard to names which have  been often gathered from vulgar report, or even from authors who differ  in point of orthography, some giving opposite readings of the same name.  But it is quite necessary that such mistakes should once for all be  cleared up. The index of this work will form a new Dictionary of  Painters, certainly more copious, and perhaps more accurate than usual,  although it might be still further improved, especially by consulting  archives and manuscripts.[14]    The second object which I had in view was to advance the interests of  the art as much as lay in my power. It was of old observed that examples  have a more powerful influence on the arts than any precepts can  possess; and this is particularly true in respect to painting. Whoever  writes history upon the model of the learned ancients, ought not only to  narrate events, but to investigate their secret sources and their  causes. Now these will be here developed, tracing the progress of  painting as it advanced or declined in each school; and these causes  being invariable, point out the means of its improvement, by shewing  what ought to be pursued and what avoided. Such observations are not of  importance to the artist alone, but have a reference also to other  individuals. In the Roman school, during its second epoch, I perceive  that the progress of the arts invariably depends on certain principles  universally adopted in that age, according to which artists worked, and  the public decided. A general history, by pointing out the best maxims  of art, may contribute considerably to make them known and regarded; and  hence artists can execute, and others approve or direct, on principles  no longer uncertain and questionable, nor deduced from the manner of a  particular school, but founded on maxims unerring and established, and  strengthened by the uniform practice of all schools and all ages. We may  add, that in a history so diversified, numerous examples occur suited to  the genius of different students, who have often to lament their want of  success from this circumstance alone, that they had neglected to follow  the path in which nature had destined them to tread.

[Illustration: A Trapped Coyote.]    Coyotes have a more regular breeding season than the timber wolves,  for practically all of the young make their appearance in the months  of April and May. The number of young varies from five to twelve. The  young animals are of a yellowish grey color with brown ears and black  tail, muzzle tawny or yellowish brown. As they become older they take  on a lighter shade and the tail changes to greyish with a black tip.  Both wolves and coyotes pair for the breeding season and the males  stay with the females during the summer and help take care of the  young. It is probable that they do not breed until two years of age.  As soon as the young are strong enough, and their eyes are open they  commence to play about the mouth of the den and later on the mother  leads them to the nearest water and finally allows them to accompany  her on hunting excursions. In late summer they start out to shift for  themselves.    As before mentioned, the coyote is a wary and cunning animal,  especially in the more settled portions of its range; where man is  not too much in evidence, they are far less wary. Again the fact that  there are several varieties may account for the difference in the  nature of the animals of the various sections, anyway those of the  southern part of the range are less wary than those of the North. The  trappers of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico claim that the coyote is a  fool and is easily caught while those of the North and Northwest find  them exceedingly cunning and intelligent. Not only does the animal  appear to know when you are armed but it also seems to know something  of the range of the weapon and will sneak along provokingly close,  but just out of reach. When one is unarmed they appear to be more  bold and will loaf around in the most unconcerned manner imaginable.    In intelligence and cunning, we consider the northern coyote the  equal of the eastern red fox. While the western trappers make very  large catches of coyotes, we believe that if foxes were found in  equal numbers the catches of those animals would be fully as large.  The number of coyotes found in some parts of the West is almost  incredible, and in most parts one will find a hundred coyotes to one  grey wolf.      [Illustration: Track of the Coyote.]    The coyote makes a track similar to that of the timber wolf, but  considerably smaller. The length of step, when walking, is about  sixteen inches and the footprints will measure about two or two and a  fourth inches in length by one and a half in width.        CHAPTER III.    KILLING OF STOCK AND GAME BY WOLVES.    Undoubtedly the wolves and coyotes of the United States and Canada  destroy more stock and game than all other predatory animals  combined. In the Western part of our country where stock raising is  one of the principal industries, the ranchmen suffer great losses  from the depredation of these animals, and in other sections the  wolves destroy large quantities of game. The reason that wolves are  more destructive than others of the carnivora is that when they have  the opportunity, they kill far more than they can consume for food.  Often they only tear a mouthful of flesh from the body of their  victim; sometimes they do not even kill the animal but leave it to  suffer a slow and painful death. The animals that are only slightly  bitten are sure to die from blood poisoning, according to the western  ranchmen.      [Illustration: Wolves Killing a Deer.]    The wolf's method of attack is from the rear, springing on its victim  and hamstringing it and literally eating it alive. The bite of the  wolf is a succession of quick, savage snaps and there is no salvation  for the creature that has no means of defense from a rear attack.  This peculiar method of killing prey can not be practiced  successfully on horses, owing to the fact that they can defend  themselves by kicking, but for all of that, a considerable number of  colts and a few full grown horses are killed. For this reason cattle  suffer more than horses, but while the horse is, to a certain extent,  exempt from attack by wolves, they are frequently killed by mountain  lions, because their method of attack, a spring at the head and  throat is more successful with these animals than with cattle. As  food, however, horse flesh is preferred to beef by both of these  animals.    One of the western trappers writes:    \"Many times in the past thirty years I have watched wolves catch  cows. The wolf is by nature a coward and will not, singly, attack a  grown cow, though he will by himself kill a pig, chicken, calf, goat  or sheep.    \"On the ranges, where the stockmen and settlements are far apart,  wolves go in bunches, from three to ten or even more, and when very  hungry a bunch of them will attack a grown bull. They frighten him by  snapping and playing around him till they get him on the run, when  the bunch give full chase and stay close at his heels. While he is  running in this way, one or more of them will grab him by the ham  strings just above the hock joint. The bull makes, of course, a  vigorous effort to free himself from the wolf, but before he can do  so, the sharp teeth of the latter have cut or partially cut the ham  string. They keep him on the run till they finally cut him down in  both ham strings and then he cannot go further or fight the hungry  wolves off.    \"The whole bunch then eat his hams out while the bull is still alive,  and after they get their full they let him rest. When they want to  fill up again, they return and eat him till he dies, finishing the  carcass as they require food.    \"I have seen horses and cattle killed by wolves in this way live for  several days with their hams eaten out, and have never seen the wolf  make his attack or give chase in any other way. Being cowardly, he  always follows behind and keeps out of all danger from the bull's  hoofs.\"    Of cattle, calves and yearlings are generally selected, partly  because the flesh of the younger animals is more to the wolf's liking  and partly because they cannot defend themselves as readily as full  grown animals, but full grown steers are also killed at times. Far  more cattle are killed than are eaten. The wolf prefers fresh food  always and in summer when their resources are unlimited they seldom  return to the carcass for a second meal.    In \"Bulletin 72,\" issued by the United States Department of  Agriculture, the author, Mr. Vernon Bailey, has the following to say  on the subject:    \"The actual number of cattle killed by wolves can not be determined.  Comparatively few animals are found by cattlemen and hunters, when  freshly killed, with wolf tracks around them and with wolf marks on  them. Not all of the adult cattle missing from a herd can surely be  charged the depredations of wolves, while missing calves may have  been taken by wolves, by mountain lions, or by 'rustlers.'\"    Nevertheless there are data enough from which to draw fairly reliable  conclusions. In the Green River Basin, Wyoming, on April 2, 1906, Mr.  Charles Budd had 8 yearling calves and 4 colts killed in his pasture  by wolves within six weeks. At Big Piney a number of cattle and a few  horses had been killed around the settlement during the previous fall  and winter. At Pinedale, members of the local stockmen's association  counted 30 head of cattle killed in the valley around Cora and  Pinedale in 1905, between April, when the cattle were turned out on  the range, and June 30, when they were driven to the mountains. In  1906, wolves were said to have come into the pastures near Cora and  Pinedale and begun killing cattle in January on the \"feed grounds,\"  and Mr. George Glover counted up 22 head of cattle killed by them up  to April 10. Just north of Cora, Mr. Alexander, a well known  ranchman, told me that the wolves killed near his place in June,  1904, a large three year old steer, a cow, 3 yearlings and a horse.  On the G O S Ranch, in the Gila Forest Reserve in New Mexico, May 11  to 30, 1906, the cowboys on the round-up reported finding calves or  yearlings killed by wolves almost daily, and Mr. Victor Culberson,  president of the company, estimated the loss by wolves on the ranch  at 10 per cent. of the cattle.    In a letter to the Biological Survey, under date of April 3, 1896,  Mr. R. M. Allen, general manager of the Standard Cattle Company, with  headquarters at Ames, Neb., and ranches in both Wyoming and Montana,  states that in 1894 his company paid a $5.00 bounty at their Wyoming  ranch on almost exactly 500 wolves. The total loss to Wyoming through  the depredations of wolves Mr. Allen estimated at a million dollars a  year.    In an address before the National Live Stock Association at Denver,  Col., January 25, 1899, Mr. A. J. Bothwell said: \"In central Wyoming  my experience has been that these wolves kill from 10 to 20 per cent.  of the annual increase of the herds.\"    Lieut. E. L. Munson, of Chouteau County, Mont., writing in  _Recreation_, says: \"It is said that in this country the loss from  wolves and coyotes is about 15 per cent. * * * Wolves in this  vicinity seldom kill sheep, as the latter are too carefully herded.  They get a good many young colts, but prey especially on young  cattle.\"    Mr. J. B. Jennett, of Stanford, Montana, says in _Recreation_: \"A  family of wolves will destroy about $3,000 worth of stock per annum.\"    The loss caused by wolves and coyotes in Big Horn County, Wyo., is  estimated at three hundred thousand dollars per year. It has been  variously estimated that each grey wolf costs the stockmen from two  hundred and fifty to one thousand dollars annually.    Sheep, for some reason, are seldom troubled by timber wolves in the  West, but suffer considerably from the attacks of coyotes; in fact,  the loss occasioned the sheep"]]]
