[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#3)"],[1,"pimpling, the shoulders growing bowed, the hair falling scant and  grey upon his head; and the last that ever I saw of him, he was standing  at the mouth of an entry with several men in moleskin, three parts drunk,  and his old black raiment daubed with mud.  I fancy that I still can hear  him laugh.  There was something heart-breaking in this gradual declension  at so advanced an age; you would have thought a man of sixty out of the  reach of these calamities; you would have thought that he was niched by  that time into a safe place in life, whence he could pass quietly and  honourably into the grave.    One of the earliest marks of these _degringolades_ is, that the victim  begins to disappear from the New Town thoroughfares, and takes to the  High Street, like a wounded animal to the woods.  And such an one is the  type of the quarter.  It also has fallen socially.  A scutcheon over the  door somewhat jars in sentiment where there is a washing at every window.  The old man, when I saw him last, wore the coat in which he had played  the gentleman three years before; and that was just what gave him so  pre-eminent an air of wretchedness.    [Picture: High Street] It is true that the over-population was at least  as dense in the epoch of lords and ladies, and that now-a-days some  customs which made Edinburgh notorious of yore have been fortunately  pretermitted.  But an aggregation of comfort is not distasteful like an  aggregation of the reverse.  Nobody cares how many lords and ladies, and  divines and lawyers, may have been crowded into these houses in the  past--perhaps the more the merrier.  The glasses clink around the china  punch-bowl, some one touches the virginals, there are peacocks' feathers  on the chimney, and the tapers burn clear and pale in the red firelight.  That is not an ugly picture in itself, nor will it become ugly upon  repetition.  All the better if the like were going on in every second  room; the _land_ would only look the more inviting.  Times are changed.  In one house, perhaps, two-score families herd together; and, perhaps,  not one of them is wholly out of the reach of want.  The great hotel is  given over to discomfort from the foundation to the chimney-tops;  everywhere a pinching, narrow habit, scanty meals, and an air of  sluttishness and dirt.  In the first room there is a birth, in another a  death, in a third a sordid drinking-bout, and the detective and the  Bible-reader cross upon the stairs.  High words are audible from dwelling  to dwelling, and children have a strange experience from the first; only  a robust soul, you would think, could grow up in such conditions without  hurt.  And even if God tempers His dispensations to the young, and all  the ill does not arise that our apprehensions may forecast, the sight of  such a way of living is disquieting to people who are more happily  circumstanced.  Social inequality is nowhere more ostentatious than at  Edinburgh.  I have mentioned already how, to the stroller along Princes  Street, the High Street callously exhibits its back garrets.  It is true,  there is a garden between.  And although nothing could be more glaring by  way of contrast, sometimes the opposition is more immediate; sometimes  the thing lies in a nutshell, and there is not so much as a blade of  grass between the rich and poor.  To look over the South Bridge and see  the Cowgate below full of crying hawkers, is to view one rank of society  from another in the twinkling of an eye.    One night I went along the Cowgate after every one was a-bed but the  policeman, and stopped by hazard before a tall _land_.  The moon touched  upon its chimneys, and shone blankly on the upper windows; there was no  light anywhere in the great bulk of building; but as I stood there it  seemed to me that I could hear quite a body of quiet sounds from the  interior; doubtless there were many clocks ticking, and people snoring on  their backs.  And thus, as I fancied, the dense life within made itself  faintly audible in my ears, family after family contributing its quota to  the general hum, and the whole pile beating in tune to its timepieces,  like a great disordered heart.  Perhaps it was little more than a fancy  altogether, but it was strangely impressive at the time, and gave me an  imaginative measure of the disproportion between the quantity of living  flesh and the trifling walls that separated and contained it.    There was nothing fanciful, at least, but every circumstance of terror  and reality, in the fall of the _land_ in the High Street.  The building  had grown rotten to the core; the entry underneath had suddenly closed up  so that the scavenger's barrow could not pass; cracks and reverberations  sounded through the house at night; the inhabitants of the huge old human  bee-hive discussed their peril when they encountered on the stair; some  had even left their dwellings in a panic of fear, and returned to them  again in a fit of economy or self-respect; when, in the black hours of a  Sunday morning, the whole structure ran together with a hideous uproar  and tumbled story upon story to the ground.  The physical shock was felt  far and near; and the moral shock travelled with the morning milkmaid  into all the suburbs.  The church-bells never sounded more dismally over  Edinburgh than that grey forenoon.  Death had made a brave harvest, and,  like Samson, by pulling down one roof, destroyed many a home.  None who  saw it can have forgotten the aspect of the gable; here it was plastered,  there papered, according to the rooms; here the kettle still stood on the  hob, high overhead; and there a cheap picture of the Queen was pasted  over the chimney.  So, by this disaster, you had a glimpse into the life  of thirty families, all suddenly cut off from the revolving years.  The  _land_ had fallen; and with the _land_ how much!  Far in the country,  people saw a gap in the city ranks, and the sun looked through between  the chimneys in an unwonted place.  And all over the world, in London, in  Canada, in New Zealand, fancy what a multitude of people could exclaim  with truth: 'The house that I was born in fell last night!'          CHAPTER III. THE PARLIAMENT CLOSE.      Time has wrought its changes most notably around the precincts of St.  Giles's Church.  The church itself, if it were not for the spire, would  be unrecognisable; the _Krames_ are all gone, not a shop is left to  shelter in its buttresses; and zealous magistrates and a misguided  architect have shorn the design of manhood, and left it poor, naked, and  pitifully pretentious.  As St. Giles's must have had in former days a  rich and quaint appearance now forgotten, so the neighbourhood was  bustling, sunless, and romantic.  It was here that the town was most  overbuilt; but the overbuilding has been all rooted out, and not only a  free fair-way left along the High Street with an open space on either  side of the church, but a great porthole, knocked in the main line of the  _lands_, gives an outlook to the north and the New Town.    [Picture: The Spire of St. Giles's] There is a silly story of a  subterranean passage between the Castle and Holyrood, and a bold Highland  piper who volunteered to explore its windings.  He made his entrance by  the upper end, playing a strathspey; the curious footed it after him down  the street, following his descent by the sound of the chanter from below;  until all of a sudden, about the level of St. Giles's, the music came  abruptly to an end, and the people in the street stood at fault with  hands uplifted.  Whether he was choked with gases, or perished in a quag,  or was removed bodily by the Evil One, remains a point of doubt; but the  piper has never again been seen or heard of from that day to this.  Perhaps he wandered down into the land of Thomas the Rhymer, and some  day, when it is least expected, may take a thought to revisit the sunlit  upper world.  That will be a strange moment for the cabmen on the stance  besides St. Giles's, when they hear the drone of his pipes reascending  from the bowels of the earth below their horses' feet.    But it is not only pipers who have vanished, many a solid bulk of masonry  has been likewise spirited into the air.  Here, for example, is the shape  of a heart let into the causeway.  This was the site of the Tolbooth, the  Heart of Midlothian, a place old in story and namefather to a noble book.  The walls are now down in the dust; there is no more _squalor carceris_  for merry debtors, no more cage for the old, acknowledged prison-breaker;  but the sun and the wind play freely over the foundations of the jail.  Nor is this the only memorial that the pavement keeps of former days.  The ancient burying-ground of Edinburgh lay behind St. Giles's Church,  running downhill to the Cowgate and covering the site of the present  Parliament House.  It has disappeared as utterly as the prison or the  Luckenbooths; and for those ignorant of its history, I know only one  token that remains.  In the Parliament Close, trodden daily underfoot by  advocates, two letters and a date mark the resting-place of the man who  made Scotland over again in his own image, the indefatigable,  undissuadable John Knox.  He sleeps within call of the church that so  often echoed to his preaching.    Hard by the reformer, a bandy-legged and garlanded Charles Second, made  of lead, bestrides a tun-bellied charger.  The King has his backed  turned, and, as you look, seems to be trotting clumsily away from such a  dangerous neighbour.  Often, for hours together, these two will be alone  in the Close, for it lies out of the way of all but legal traffic.  On  one side the south wall of the church, on the other the arcades of the  Parliament House, enclose this irregular bight of causeway and describe  their shadows on it in the sun.  At either end, from round St. Giles's  buttresses, you command a look into the High Street with its motley  passengers; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#3)"],[1," Beetle (_Haltica_).      50.

CHAPTER I.      _THE CLASSIFICATION OF INSECTS._      About forty years ago the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of St.  Fernando in Chili arrested a certain M. Renous on a charge of  witchcraft, because he kept some caterpillars which turned into  butterflies.[1] This was no doubt an extreme case of ignorance; it is  now almost universally known that the great majority of insects quit the  egg in a state very different from that which they ultimately assume;  and the general statement in works on entomology has been that the life  of an insect may be divided into four periods.    Thus, according to Kirby and Spence,[2] \"The states through which  insects pass are four: the _egg_, the _larva_, the _pupa_, and the  _imago_.\" Burmeister,[3] also, says that, excluding certain very rare  anomalies, \"we may observe four distinct periods of existence in every  insect,--namely, those of the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago,  or perfect insect.\" In fact, however, the various groups of insects  differ widely from one another in the metamorphoses they pass through:  in some, as in the grasshoppers and crickets, the changes consist  principally in a gradual increase of size, and in the acquisition of  wings; while others, as for instance the common fly, acquire their full  bulk in a form very different from that which they ultimately assume,  and pass through a period of inaction in which not only is the whole  form of the body altered, not only are legs and wings acquired, but even  the internal organs themselves are almost entirely disintegrated and  re-formed. It will be my object, after having briefly described these  changes, to throw some light on the causes to which they are due, and on  the indications they afford of the stages through which insects have  been evolved.    The following list gives the orders or principal groups into which the  Class Insecta may be divided. I will not, indeed, here enter upon my own  views, but will adopt the system given by Mr. Westwood in his excellent  \"Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects,\" from which also,  as a standard authority, most of the figures on Plates I. to IV., when  not otherwise acknowledged, have been taken. He divides insects into  thirteen groups, and with reference to eight of them it may be said that  there is little difference of opinion among entomologists. These orders  are by far the most numerous, and I have placed them in capital  letters. As regards the other five there is still much difference of  opinion. It must also be observed that Prof. Westwood omits the  parasitic Anoplura, as well as the Thysanura and Collembola.      ORDERS OF INSECTS ACCORDING TO WESTWOOD.       1. HYMENOPTERA   Bees, Wasps, Ants, &c.     2. STREPSIPTERA  _Stylops_, _Zenos_, &c.     3. COLEOPTERA    Beetles.     4. EUPLEXOPTERA  Earwigs.     5. ORTHOPTERA    Grasshoppers, Crickets, Cockroaches, &c.     6. THYSANOPTERA  _Thrips_.     7. NEUROPTERA    _Ephemeras_, &c.     8. TRICHOPTERA   _Phryganea_.     9. DIPTERA       Flies and Gnats.    10. APHANIPTERA   Fleas.    11. HETEROPTERA   Bugs.    12. HOMOPTERA     _Aphis_, _Coccus_, &c.    13. LEPIDOPTERA   Butterflies and Moths.    Of these thirteen orders, the eight which I have placed in capital  letters--namely the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh,  twelfth, and thirteenth, are much the most important in the number and  variety of their species; the other five form comparatively small  groups. The Strepsiptera are minute insects, parasitic on Hymenoptera:  Rossi, by whom they were discovered, regarded them as Hymenopterous;  Lamarck placed them among the Diptera; by others they have been  considered to be most closely allied to the Coleoptera, but they are now  generally treated as an independent order.    The Euplexoptera or Earwigs are only too familiar to most of us. Linnaeus  classed them among the Coleoptera, from which, however, they differ in  their transformations. Fabricius, Olivier, and Latreille regarded them  as Orthoptera; but Dr. Leach, on account of the structure of their  wings, considered them as forming the type of a distinct order, in which  view he has been followed by Westwood, Kirby, and many other  entomologists.    The Thysanoptera, consisting of the Linnaean genus _Thrips_, are minute  insects well known to gardeners, differing from the Coleoptera in the  nature of their metamorphoses, in which they resemble the Orthoptera and  Hemiptera. The structure of the wings and mouth-parts, however, are  considered to exclude them from these two orders.    The Trichoptera, or Caddis worms, offer many points of resemblance to  the Neuroptera, while in others they approach more nearly to the  Lepidoptera. According to Westwood, the genus _Phryganea_ \"forms the  connecting link between the Neuroptera and Lepidoptera.\"    The last of these small aberrant orders is that of the Aphaniptera,  constituted for the family Pulicidae. In their transformations, as in  many other respects, they closely resemble the Diptera. Strauss  Durckheim indeed said that \"_la puce est un diptere sans ailes_.\"  Westwood, however, regards it as constituting a separate order.    As indicated by the names of these orders, the structure of the wings  affords extremely natural and convenient characters by which the various  groups may be distinguished from one another. The mouth-parts also are  very important; and, regarded from this point of view, the Insecta have  been divided into two series--the Mandibulata and Haustellata, or  mandibulate and suctorial groups, between which, as I have elsewhere  shown,[4] the Collembola (_Podura_, _Smynthurus_, &c.) occupy an  intermediate position. These two series are:--    MANDIBULATA.      Hymenoptera.    Strepsiptera.    Coleoptera.    Euplexoptera.    Orthoptera.    Trichoptera?    Thysanoptera?    HAUSTELLATA.      Lepidoptera.    Diptera.    Aphaniptera.    Hemiptera.    Homoptera.    Again--and this is the most important from my present point of  view--insects have sometimes been divided into two other series,  according to the nature of their metamorphoses: \"Heteromorpha,\" to use  the terminology of Prof. Westwood,[5] \"or those in which there is no  resemblance between the parent and the offspring; and Homomorpha, or  those in which the larva resembles the imago, except in the absence of  wings. In the former the larva is generally worm-like, of a soft and  fleshy consistence, and furnished with a mouth, and often with six short  legs attached in pairs to the three segments succeeding the head. In the  Homomorpha, including the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, and certain  Neuroptera, the body, legs, and antennae are nearly similar in their form  to those of the perfect insect, but the wings are wanting.\"    HETEROMORPHA.      Hymenoptera.    Strepsiptera.    Coleoptera.    Trichoptera.    Diptera.    Aphaniptera.    Lepidoptera.    HOMOMORPHA.      Euplexoptera.    Orthoptera.    Hemiptera.    Homoptera.    Thysanoptera.    Neuroptera.    But though the Homomorphic insects do not pass through such striking  changes of form as the Heteromorphic, and are active throughout life,  still it was until within the last few years generally (though  erroneously) considered, that in them, as in the Heteromorpha, the life  fell into four distinct periods; those of (1) the egg, (2) the larva,  characterized by the absence of wings, (3) the pupa with imperfect  wings, and (4) the imago, or perfect insect.    I have, however, elsewhere[6] shown that there are not, as a matter of  fact, four well-marked stages, and four only, but that in many cases the  process is much more gradual.    The species belonging to the order Hymenoptera are among the most  interesting of insects. To this order belong the gallflies, the  sawflies, the ichneumons, and, above all, the ants and bees. We are  accustomed to class the Anthropoid apes next to man in the scale of  creation, but if we were to judge animals by their works, the chimpanzee  and the gorilla must certainly give place to the bee and the ant. The  larvae of the sawflies, which live on leaves, and of the Siricidae or  long-tailed wasps, which feed on wood, are very much like caterpillars,  having three pairs of legs, and in the former case abdominal pro-legs  as well: but in the great majority of Hymenoptera the larvae are legless,  fleshy grubs (Plate II., Figs. 7-9); and the various modes by which the  females provide for, or secure to, them a sufficient supply of  appropriate nourishment constitutes one of the most interesting pages of  Natural History.    The species of Hymenoptera are very numerous; in this country alone  there are about 3,000 kinds, most of which are very small. In the pupa  state they are inactive, and show distinctly all the limbs of the  perfect insect, encased in distinct sheaths, and folded on the breast.  In the perfect state they are highly organized and very active. The  working ants and some few species are wingless, but the great majority  have four strong membranous wings, a character distinguishing them at  once from the true flies, which have only one pair of wings.    The saw-flies are so called because they possess at the end of the body a  curious organ, corresponding to the sting of a wasp, but which is in the  form of a fine-toothed saw. With this instrument the female sawfly cuts  a slit in the stem or leaf of a plant, into which she introduces her  egg. The"]]]
