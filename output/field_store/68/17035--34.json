One of these is a very long cupboard with large doors. (Fig. 1.) It is  very low so that a small child can set on the top of it small objects  such as mats, flowers, etc. Inside this cupboard is kept the didactic  material which is the common property of all the children.    The other is a chest of drawers containing two or three columns of  little drawers, each of which has a bright handle (or a handle of some  color to contrast with the background), and a small card with a name  upon it. Every child has his own drawer, in which to put things  belonging to him.    Round the walls of the room are fixed blackboards at a low level, so  that the children can write or draw on them, and pleasing, artistic  pictures, which are changed from time to time as circumstances direct.  The pictures represent children, families, landscapes, flowers and  fruit, and more often Biblical and historical incidents. Ornamental  plants and flowering plants ought always to be placed in the room  where the children are at work.    Another part of the working-room's equipment is seen in the pieces of  carpet of various colors--red, blue, pink, green and brown. The  children spread these rugs upon the floor, sit upon them and work  there with the didactic material. A room of this kind is larger than  the customary class-rooms, not only because the little tables and  separate chairs take up more space, but also because a large part of  the floor must be free for the children to spread their rugs and work  upon them.    In the sitting-room, or \"club-room,\" a kind of parlor in which the  children amuse themselves by conversation, games, or music, etc., the  furnishings should be especially tasteful. Little tables of different  sizes, little armchairs and sofas should be placed here and there.  Many brackets of all kinds and sizes, upon which may be put  statuettes, artistic vases or framed photographs, should adorn the  walls; and, above all, each child should have a little flower-pot, in  which he may sow the seed of some indoor plant, to tend and cultivate  it as it grows. On the tables of this sitting-room should be placed  large albums of colored pictures, and also games of patience, or  various geometric solids, with which the children can play at  pleasure, constructing figures, etc. A piano, or, better, other  musical instruments, possibly harps of small dimensions, made  especially for children, completes the equipment. In this \"club-room\"  the teacher may sometimes entertain the children with stories, which  will attract a circle of interested listeners.    The furniture of the dining-room consists, in addition to the tables,  of low cupboards accessible to all the children, who can themselves  put in their place and take away the crockery, spoons, knives and  forks, table-cloth and napkins. The plates are always of china, and  the tumblers and water-bottles of glass. Knives are always included in  the table equipment.    _The Dressing-room._ Here each child has his own little cupboard or  shelf. In the middle of the room there are very simple washstands,  consisting of tables, on each of which stand a small basin, soap and  nail-brush. Against the wall stand little sinks with water-taps. Here  the children may draw and pour away their water. There is no limit to  the equipment of the \"Children's Houses\" because the children  themselves do everything. They sweep the rooms, dust and wash the  furniture, polish the brasses, lay and clear away the table, wash up,  sweep and roll up the rugs, wash a few little clothes, and cook eggs.  As regards their personal toilet, the children know how to dress and  undress themselves. They hang their clothes on little hooks, placed  very low so as to be within reach of a little child, or else they fold  up such articles of clothing, as their little serving-aprons, of which  they take great care, and lay them inside a cupboard kept for the  household linen.                      *       *       *       *       *    In short, where the manufacture of toys has been brought to such a  point of complication and perfection that children have at their  disposal entire dolls' houses, complete wardrobes for the dressing and  undressing of dolls, kitchens where they can pretend to cook, toy  animals as nearly lifelike as possible, this method seeks to give all  this to the child in reality--making him an actor in a living scene.                      *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: FIG 2.--THE MONTESSORI PAEDOMETER.]    My pedometer forms part of the equipment of a \"Children's House.\"  After various modifications I have now reduced this instrument to a  very practical form. (Fig. 2.)    The purpose of the pedometer, as its name shows, is to measure the  children. It consists of a wide rectangular board, forming the base,  from the center of which rise two wooden posts held together at the  top by a narrow flat piece of metal. To each post is connected a  horizontal metal rod--the indicator--which runs up and down by means  of a casing, also of metal. This metal casing is made in one piece  with the indicator, to the end of which is fixed an india-rubber ball.  On one side, that is to say, behind one of the two tall vertical  wooden posts, there is a small seat, also of wood. The two tall wooden  posts are graduated. The post to which the seat is fixed is graduated  from the surface of the seat to the top, whilst the other is graduated  from the wooden board at the base to the top, _i.e._ to a height of  1.5 meters. On the side containing the seat the height of the child  seated is measured, on the other side the child's full stature. The  practical value of this instrument lies in the possibility of  measuring two children at the same time, and in the fact that the  children themselves cooperate in taking the measurements. In fact,  they learn to take off their shoes and to place themselves in the  correct position on the pedometer. They find no difficulty in raising  and lowering the metal indicators, which are held so firmly in place  by means of the metal casing that they cannot deviate from their  horizontal position even when used by inexpert hands. Moreover they  run extremely easily, so that very little strength is required to move  them. The little india-rubber balls prevent the children from hurting  themselves should they inadvertently knock their heads against the  metal indicator.    The children are very fond of the pedometer. \"Shall we measure  ourselves?\" is one of the proposals which they make most willingly and  with the greatest likelihood of finding many of their companions to  join them. They also take great care of the pedometer, dusting it, and  polishing its metal parts. All the surfaces of the pedometer are so  smooth and well polished that they invite the care that is taken of  them, and by their appearance when finished fully repay the trouble  taken.    The pedometer represents the scientific part of the method, because it  has reference to the anthropological and psychological study made of  the children, each of whom has his own biographical record. This  biographical record follows the history of the child's development  according to the observations which it is possible to make by the  application of my method. This subject is dealt with at length in my  other books. A series of cinematograph pictures has been taken of the  pedometer at a moment when the children are being measured. They are  seen coming of their own accord, even the very smallest, to take their  places at the instrument.          THE METHOD      The technique of my method as it follows the guidance of the natural  physiological and psychical development of the child, may be divided  into three parts:      Motor education.    Sensory education.    Language.    The care and management of the environment itself afford the principal  means of motor education, while sensory education and the education of  language are provided for by my didactic material.    The didactic material for the _education of the senses_ consists of:      (_a_) Three sets of solid insets.    (_b_) Three sets of solids in graduated sizes, comprising:          (1) Pink cubes.          (2) Brown prisms.          (3) Rods: (_a_) colored green; (_b_) colored alternately              red and blue.    (_c_) Various geometric solids (prism, pyramid, sphere, cylinder,            cone, etc.).    (_d_) Rectangular tablets with rough and smooth surfaces.    (_e_) A collection of various stuffs.    (_f_) Small wooden tablets of different weights.    (_g_) Two boxes, each containing sixty-four colored tablets.    (_h_) A chest of drawers containing plane insets.    (_i_) Three series of cards on which are pasted geometrical forms            in paper.    (_k_) A collection of cylindrical closed boxes (sounds).    (_l_) A double series of musical bells, wooden boards on which are            painted the lines used in music, small wooden discs for            the notes.      _Didactic Material for the Preparation for Writing and Arithmetic_      (_m_) Two sloping desks and various iron insets.    (_n_) Cards on which are pasted sandpaper letters.    (_o_) Two alphabets of colored cardboard and            of different sizes.    (_p_) A series of cards on which are pasted sandpaper            figures (1, 2, 3, etc.).    (_q_) A series of large cards bearing the same            figures in smooth paper for the enumeration            of numbers above ten.    (_r_) Two boxes with small sticks for counting.    (_s_) The volume of drawings belonging specially            to the method, and colored pencils.    (_t_) The frames for lacing, buttoning, etc., which            are used for the education of the movements            of the hand.          MOTOR EDUCATION      The education of the movements is very complex, as it must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29688"],[0,"Home Range and Movements of the Eastern Cottontail in Kansas (#3)"],[1,"were  found in severe summer weather, and five per cent were found at times  when the weather was not severe. Undercut creek banks and exposed tree  root-systems in eroded gullies were favorite hiding places. Brush that  had accumulated in the ravines and stream beds also was used for cover  by the cottontail.    In heavy rain a cottontail may move along, neither hopping nor running,  with its body close to the ground, head low, ears laid back. Losing its  customary alertness it may pass a person without seeing him. At times,  I have been able to approach almost close enough to seize one of the  miserable creatures. In deep snow cottontails may progress with long  bounds carrying them high enough vertically, to clear the surrounding  snow.    Courting activities were seen only in evening. Four male cottontails  and three females were observed to move an estimated 1200 feet in an  evening (1-1/4 hours) while chasing each other around in an area of  less than an acre. It is presumed that this activity was in addition to  normal movements made while foraging.    Seven females known to be pregnant or lactating were not observed to  move more than 100 feet away from their centers of activity. Their  nests were never found. At the same time the males were moving over  much larger areas.    The cottontail is most active in the evening or early morning. Of those  for which time of capture in live-traps was known 70 per cent were  captured in the evening between dusk and 11:00 P.M., 10 per cent were  captured between 11:00 P.M. and dawn, and 20 per cent were captured  after dawn. Nocturnal rodents and carnivores often stole bait in the  night; the percentage of capture of cottontails after dawn might have  been larger had bait remained in all the traps.    Except for those flushed, cottontails were seldom seen by day. In walks  through the study area approximately three times as many cottontails  were flushed at night as in the daytime. On cloudy days cottontails  were active longer than on bright days. On dark nights more cottontails  were captured in live-traps between 11:00 P.M. and dawn than on bright  moonlight nights.    Cottontails were more active (as determined by trap success and  frequency of observation) at temperatures between 0 deg. F. and 33 deg. F. than  at temperatures between 33 deg. F. and 55 deg. F. Activity of the cottontail  increased as the temperature of the air decreased. Activity increased  in proportion to the percentage of ground covered by snow. Activity of  the cottontail decreased as precipitation increased; there was less  activity in rain than in snow and less activity in wet snow than in dry  snow. Activity did not vary significantly with depth of snow until snow  was more than 8 inches deep, when activity decreased abruptly.    The average of the longest distance traveled between captures for  cottontails whose entire home ranges were thought to have been sampled  was 900 feet for males and 684 feet for females. The average of the  maximum distance across the home range for cottontails whose home range  had been thoroughly sampled was 1019 feet for males, and 936 feet for  females.    The home range is used by the cottontail in different ways, depending  on the needs of the individual and the condition of the habitat. In  uniform habitat the home range is roughly circular and is used most  near its center and least toward its periphery. The entire home range  is traversed every four or five days. The center of the home range has  been called the \"center of activity\" (Connell, 1954).    In habitat of alternating woodland and grassland, such as that on the  University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, two centers of  activity often developed in the home range of a cottontail, at opposite  edges of a tract of woodland. The individual concentrated its movements  near one center for three to five days then moved to the other center.  Pursuit by a predator, random movement, or other cause may be  responsible for shift from one edge to another.

Cottontail in bag with ear protruding, ready for  marking with nylon ribbon and metal ear-tag shown in upper right hand  corner. x 1/4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Cottontail bearing ear-tags and ribbon. x 1/4.]    When moving undisturbed through the woods cottontails usually do not  pause to forage or associate with other cottontails, but keep to a  straight route except in severe weather, when, as noted above, they  find resting places in the woods. Ninety-two per cent of the  cottontails captured in live-traps were captured within 100 feet of a  woodland edge; six per cent were captured in the woods, more than 100  feet from an edge, and two per cent were captured in grassland more  than 100 feet from the edge. In winter, when the air temperature was  less than 20 deg. F., 22 per cent of the cottontails were captured  in the woods more than 100 feet from the edge.    The maximum distance between two centers of activity of an individual  was 700 feet, average 550 feet. If two centers of activity were  maintained, the cottontail usually traversed the entire home range  every seven to 11 days.    In no case was a cottontail known to have lived in two woodland edges  which were separated by open grassland. Cottontails usually did not  move more than 75 feet from suitable cover. In winter when herbaceous  vegetation was dormant cottontails did not cross open fields.    Forms in grass clumps were the usual resting place for cottontails, but  others in brush piles, rock outcrops, and tree stumps were also used.  On the average a cottontail maintained 3.5 forms. If disturbed  repeatedly at a form, a cottontail would permanently desert it. On  seven occasions a cottontail used a form that had been used by another  within 24 hours. Three cottontails used the same shelter under a rock  ledge in five days; one was under the ledge on December 17, 1955, and  another was there on December 18. The first was there again on December  20 and a third was there on December 21. The original cottontail had  returned by January 2, 1956. There may be 20 to 30 resting places used  by cottontails within a single home range area since five to seven  cottontails may live there as co-occupants at one time. Two  cottontails, both males, lived together in a _Smilax_ thicket for three  weeks, resting within 15 inches of each other. Occasionally a female  was present in the same thicket, and rested about three feet from the  males.    A male trapped on land adjoining the Reservation and confined overnight  at the Reservation headquarters escaped the next day and was seen 32  days later, 1800 feet from the point of escape, back in the area where  it was originally captured.    A female confined for observation, escaped and ran in the direction  opposite from her home. Subsequently she was seen on four different  occasions, over a period of one month, in her original home range,  1,100 feet from the point where she escaped. Both these animals which  made homing movements had been removed in cloth bags from their homes.    Another cottontail removed from its home range and taken to the  laboratory building to be marked, escaped and ran to a nearby wooded  hillside without pursuit where it could be observed because of snow on  the ground and lack of leaves on the trees. The animal ran and hopped  about over a one-half acre area. Its movements seemed to be unoriented  and it frequently stopped and stood on its hind legs in order to look  about. After 10 minutes of this behavior, a red-tailed hawk (_Buteo  jamaicensis_) screamed as it flew overhead. The cottontail, stimulated  by seeing and/or hearing the hawk, ran faster, moving in circles until  it disappeared from view five minutes later. When last observed the  cottontail was 1,700 feet from its home range and was headed in the  opposite direction. It had passed several potential shelters but had  not attempted to use them, presumably because it was not familiar with  the area. Although for several months afterward traps were operated in  the cottontail's home range area and in the area where it escaped, the  animal was never recaptured.      SIZE AND SHAPE OF HOME RANGE    Of the 89 cottontails observed in the study, 35 were captured in  live-traps only once and were never seen in the field or trailed. The  remaining 54 served for calculation of home range by one or more  methods. The minimum, maximum and average home ranges for these 54  individuals were calculated by each of five methods. All individuals  for which any area was recorded were included in the average.  Incomplete home ranges lower the averages."]]]
