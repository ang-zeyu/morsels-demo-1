They were never seen on land during our short stay in the  basin. The few stomachs that were opened contained vegetable material.  In terms of number of specimens trapped, _P. s. taylori_ was the most  abundant turtle in pools at and near the type locality (Webb and  Legler, 1960).    _Relationships and phylogeny._--The basin of Cuatro Cienegas now  drains, via the Rio Salado, into the lower Rio Grande. Brief  descriptions of habitats and topography in the basin are given by  Gilmore (1947:148-150, fig. 2) and Webb and Legler (1960). In the more  northern parts of the Salado drainage (for example, in the Rio Sabinas  near Muzquiz) slider turtles are typical _P. s. elegans_. Assuming  that conditions which permit genetic exchange between populations of  turtles in the Salado drainage system differ in no major respect from  conditions in other parts of the range of _Pseudemys scripta_, it is  logical to suppose that the differentiation of _P. s. taylori_ at  Cuatro Cienegas was preceded by the isolation of a population in that  basin.    The Rio Chiquito drains through a narrow gap in the northeastern end  of the basin of Cuatro Cienegas. Interruption of this stream would  effectively isolate aquatic habitats in the basin.    It is here proposed that _P. s. taylori_ is a relict of an earlier,  lower Rio Grande stock, part of which became isolated in the basin of  Cuatro Cienegas in postpluvial times. The morphological similarity of  _P. s. taylori_ and _P. s. elegans_ indicates that both were derived  from this parent stock; similarity of both subspecies to populations  of _P. s. ornata_ in Tamaulipas suggests that the latter subspecies  may also be a derivative of the mentioned stock of the lower Rio  Grande.    The proposed former isolation of the basin of Cuatro Cienegas is  supported by evidence found in studies of other turtles in the basin.  Of the four kinds of turtles known to occur there (_Terrapene  coahuila_, _P. s. taylori_, _Trionyx spinifer emoryi_, and _Trionyx  ater_), all but _T. spinifer_ seem to be endemic. These three kinds  comprise a graded series, in regard to their degree of differentiation  from closest known relatives, as follows: 1) _Terrapene coahuila_ is  morphologically the most generalized and primitive of living box  turtles; the species is unique in its highly aquatic mode of life (see  Legler, 1960:532-534, for brief discussion of relationships within  genus Terrapene); 2) _Trionyx ater_ seems to represent a relict  population of pre-_Trionyx spinifer_ stock; presumably, _spinifer_ has  reinvaded the basin of Cuatro Cienegas in relatively recent times  and, as noted above, _spinifer_ and _ater_ now occur sympatrically (at  least in a geographic sense) in the basin (Webb and Legler, _op.  cit._); and, 3) evidence presented above suggests that _P. s. taylori_  intergrades with _P. s. elegans_ outside the basin.    The three endemic populations of turtles at Cuatro Cienegas therefore,  differ by varying degrees from their closest living relatives. This  variation in degree of difference possibly results from varying  periods of isolation. Probably the basin of Cuatro Cienegas has been  isolated from, and reconnected to, the lower Rio Grande drainage at  several times in the past. The relationships of fishes in the basin,  now under study by other workers, also suggest that the basin was  isolated more than once.    _Remarks._--Local names for the above-mentioned localities in the  basin of Cuatro Cienegas are as follows: Anteojo (6 mi. W Cuatro  Cienegas); El Mojarral (8.5 mi. SW); and Ojo de Agua de Tio Candido,  on Rancho Orozco (16 km. S). The Rio Chiquito is referred to by some  natives as \"Rio Colorado\" and by some as \"Rio Salado.\" The local name  for _P. s. taylori_ is _tortuga negra_ (the name is used also for  _Terrapene coahuila_).    _Acknowledgments._--For permission to examine specimens in their care,  I wish to thank Doris M.

She's telepathic.\"    \"Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that? What kind of rubbish  have you been reading?\"    \"All right, tell me: how else did she learn to speak such good English?\"    \"It's because she's of a very high order of intelligence. And I  suppose--\" he laughed modestly--\"because I'm such a good teacher.\"    \"I don't care how good a teacher you are--a tree couldn't learn to speak  a language so well in five months. She must be telepathic. It's the only  explanation.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Give her time,\" the tree advised later, as James came out on the lawn  to talk to his only friend on the planet.    He hadn't seen much of the other scouts since the house-building frenzy  had started, and visits among the men had decreased. The base camp,  where the bachelors and the older married couples lived, was located a  good distance away from his land, for he had raised his honeymoon  cottage far from the rest; he had wanted to have his Phyllis all to  himself. In the idyll he had visualized for the two of them, she would  need no company but his. Little had he imagined that, within twenty-four  hours of her arrival, he would be looking for company himself.    \"I suppose so,\" he said, kicking at a root. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Maggie; I  didn't think.\"    \"That's all right,\" Magnolia said bravely. \"It didn't really hurt. That  female has got you all upset, you poor boy.\"    James muttered a feeble defense of his wife.    \"Jim, forgive me if I speak frankly,\" the tree went on in a low rustle,  \"but do you think she's really worthy of you?\"    \"Of course she is!\"    \"Surely on your planet you could have found a mate more admirable,  high-minded, exemplary--more, in short, like yourself. Or are all the  human females inferior specimens like Phyllis?\"    \"They're--she suits me,\" James said doggedly.    \"Of course, of course. It's very noble of you to defend her; you would  have disappointed me if you had said anything else, and I honor you for  it, James.\"    He kicked at one of the pebbles. The tree meant well, he knew, yet, like  so many well-meaning friends, she succeeded only in dispiriting him. It  was almost like being back at the faculty club.    \"I don't suppose a clod like her would have brought any more books  along,\" the tree changed the subject. James's own library had been  insufficient to slake the tree's intellectual thirst, so he had gone all  over the planet to borrow books for Magnolia. Dr. Lakin, at Base, who  had formerly taught English literature, possessed a fine collection  which he had been reluctant to lend until he had learned that they were  not for James but for a tree. At that, he had fetched the books himself,  since he was anxious to meet her.    \"A lot of the trees here have learned the English language,\" he had told  James, \"but none seems to have developed a taste for its literature.  Your Magnolia is undoubtedly a superior specimen. Excellent natural  taste, too--perhaps a little unformed when it comes to poetry and the  more sophisticated aspects of life, but she'll learn, she'll learn.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Unfortunately, the same, James knew, could hardly be said of his wife.  \"Phyllis did bring some books,\" he told Magnolia.    \"For you, no doubt. That was kind of her. I'm sure she has many good  qualities which will unfold one by one, as her meristems start  differentiating. I hope you don't feel I've been too--well, personal,  Jim. I was only trying to help. If I've gone too far....\"    \"Of course not, Maggie. After all--\" he laughed bitterly--\"I do know you  better than I know her.\"    \"We _have_ been good friends, haven't we, Jim? It was rather nice--these  five months we spent alone together. For the first time in my life, I  have never regretted being so far from my sisters. 'And this our life,  exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running  brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything.'\"    Her blue leaves shone violet in the scarlet rays of the setting sun; the  gold of her trunk was lit with red radiance. She was the most beautiful  creature he had ever seen ... but she was a tree, not a woman.    \"I'm sure she'll fit in after a while,\" Magnolia continued. \"Perhaps she  isn't well. She seems to guttate an awful lot. Do you suppose she's been  overwatered?\"    \"That wasn't guttation,\" James said heavily. \"It was tears. It means  she's unhappy.\"    \"Unhappy? Perhaps she won't fit in on this planet, in which case she  should by all means go back to Earth. It's cruel and unfair to keep an  intelligent--loosely speaking--life-form anywhere against her will,  don't you think?\"    \"She'll be happy here,\" James vowed. \"I'll _make_ her happy.\"    \"Well, I certainly hope you can manage it! By the way, do you suppose  you'll have a chance to read me the books she brought, or will she be  keeping you too busy?\"    \"I'll never be too busy to read to you, Magnolia.\"    \"That's very nitrogenous of you, Jim. Our--intellectual communions have  meant a lot to me. I'd hate to have to give them up.\"    \"So would I,\" he said. \"But there won't be any need to. Phyllis will  understand.\"    \"I certainly hope so. I so admire your English literature. It's so  deeply cognizant of the really meaningful things in life. And if your  coming to this planet has served only to add poetry to our cultural  heritage, it would be reason enough to welcome you with open limbs. For  it was a truly perceptive versifier who wrote the immortally simple  lines: 'Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.'    \"And such a charming tune to go with it, too,\" Magnolia went on. \"We  have always sung the music that the wind and the rain have taught us,  but, until you came, we never thought of putting words and melody  together to form one glorious whole. 'A tree that may in summer wear,'\"  she caroled in a pleasing contralto, \"'a nest of robins in her hair.' By  the way, Jim, ever since reading that poem, I've been meaning to ask you  precisely what are robins and do you think they'd look well in my hair,  by which, I suppose the bard refers, in a somewhat pedestrian flight of  fancy, to leaves?\"    \"They're a kind of bird,\" he said drearily.    \"Birds--nesting in my hair! I wouldn't think of allowing it. But then I  suppose Terrestrial birds are quite different from ours? More  housebroken, shall we say?\"    \"Everything's different,\" James said and, for an irrational moment, he  hated everything that was blue that should have been green, everything  sweet that should have been vicious, everything intelligent that should  have been mindless.           *       *       *       *       *    Since matters could not grow much worse, they improved to a degree.  After a day or two had passed, Phyllis, being a conscientious girl, came  to realize how wrong it had been for her as a Terrestrial immigrant to  show overt hostility toward a native of the planet that had welcomed  her.    \"But how can she be a--a person?\" Phyllis wanted to know, when they were  inside the cottage, for she had learned to hold her tongue when they  were near Magnolia or any of her sisters, who, though they could not  speak the language as fluently as she, understood it very well and  eavesdropped at every possible opportunity in order, they said, to  improve their accents. \"She's a tree. A plant. And plants are just  vegetables.\" She stabbed her needle energetically through the tablecloth  she was embroidering.    \"You mustn't project Terrestrial attitudes upon Elysian ones,\" James  said, patiently looking up from his book. \"And don't underestimate  Magnolia's capabilities. She has sense organs, and motor organs, too.  She can't move from where she is, because she's rooted to the ground,  but she's capable of turgor movements, like certain Terrestrial forms of  vegetation--for example, the sensitive plant or blue grass.\"    \"Blue grass,\" Phyllis exclaimed. \"I'm sick of blue grass. I want green  grass.\"    \"However, these trees have conscious control of their _pulvini_, whereas  the Earth's plants don't, and so they can do a lot of things that Earth  plants can't.\"    \"It sounds like a dirty word to me.\"    \"_Pulvini_ merely means motor organs.\"    \"Oh.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He closed his book, which was a more advanced botany text, covered with  the jacket of a French novel in order to spare Phyllis's feelings.  \"Darling, can't you get it through your pretty head that they're  intelligent life-forms? If it'll make it easier for you to think of them  as human beings who happen to look like trees, then do that.\"    \"That's exactly what I _am_ doing. And I'm quite sure she thinks of you  as a tree who happens to look like a human being.\"    \"Phyllis, sometimes I think you're being deliberately difficult. Do you  know one of the reasons why I took such pains to teach Magnolia English?  It was that I hoped she would be a companion for you, that you could  talk to each other when I had to be away from home.\"    \"Why do you call her Magnolia? She isn't a lot like one.\"    \"Isn't she? I thought she was. You see, I don't know so much botany,  after all.\" Actually, he had picked that name for the tree because it  expressed both the arboreal and the feminine at the same time--and also  because it was one of the loveliest names he knew. But he couldn't tell  Phyllis that; there would be further misunderstanding. \"Of course she  has a name in her own language,"]]]
