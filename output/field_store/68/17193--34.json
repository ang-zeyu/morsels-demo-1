But this was  only tasting the delights of that first experience in \"fur\" which was to  become so widely developed in future years. Working a duck decoy--when  we knew where we had the decoyman--was another profitable night  adventure, which sometimes produced dozens of delicate teal, mallard  and widgeon. Another successful method of taking seafowl was by the  \"fly\" or \"ring\" net. When there was but little or no moon these were set  across the banks last covered by the tide. The nets were made of fine  thread, and hung on poles from ten to twenty yards apart. Care had to be  taken to do this loosely, so as to give the nets plenty of \"bag.\"  Sometimes we had these nets hung for half a mile along the mud flats,  and curfew, whimbrel, geese, ducks, and various shore-haunting birds  were taken in them. Sometimes a bunch of teal, flying down wind, would  break right through the net and escape. This, however, was not a  frequent occurrence.    There is one kind of poaching, which, as a lad, I was forbidden, and I  have never indulged in it from that day to this. This was egg poaching.  In our own district it was carried on to a large extent, though I never  heard of it until the artificial rearing of game came in. The squire's  keeper will give sixpence each for pheasants' eggs, and fourpence for  those of partridges. I know for certain that he often buys eggs  (unknowingly, of course) from his master's preserves as well as those of  his neighbours. In the hedge bottom, along the covert side, or among  broom and gorse, the farm labourer notices a pair of partridges roaming  morning after morning. Soon he finds their oak-leaf nest and olive eggs.  These the keeper readily buys, winking at what he knows to be dishonest.  Ploughboys and farm labourers have peculiarly favourable opportunities  for egg poaching. As to pheasants' eggs, if the keeper be an honest man  and refuses to buy, there are always large town dealers who will. Once  in the coverts pheasants' eggs are easily found. The birds get up  heavily from their nests, and go away with a loud whirring of wings. In  this species of poaching women and children are largely employed, and at  the time the former are ostensibly gathering sticks, the latter wild  flowers. I have known the owner of the \"smithy,\" who was the receiver in  our village, send to London in the course of a week a thousand eggs,  every one of them gathered off the neighbouring estates.    When I say that I never indulged in egg poaching I do not set up for  being any better than my neighbours. I had been forbidden to do it as a  lad because my father give it the ugly name of thieving, and it had  never tempted me aside. It was tame work at best, and there was none of  the exhilarating fascination about it that I found in going after the  game birds themselves.          [Illustration]    Chapter 3.    GRADUATING IN WOODCRAFT.        We hear the cry        Of their voices high,      Falling dreamily through the sky;        But their forms we cannot see.      Just as the sportsman loves \"rough shooting,\" so the poacher invariably  chooses wild ground for his depredations. There is hardly a sea-parish  in the country which has not its shore shooter, its poacher, and its  fowler. Fortunately for my graduation in woodcraft I fell in with one of  the latter at the very time I most needed his instructions. As the  \"Snig,\" as I was generally called, was so passionately fond of \"live\"  things, old \"Kittiwake\" was quite prepared to be companionable.  Although nearly three score years and ten divided our lives, there was  something in common between us. Love of being abroad beneath the moon  and stars; of wild wintry skies; of the weird cries that came from out  the darkness--love of everything indeed that pertained to the night side  of nature. What terrible tales of the sands and marshes the old man  would tell as we sat in his turf-covered cottage, listening to the  lashing storm and driving water without. Occasionally we heard sounds of  the Demon Huntsman and his Wish-hounds as they crossed the wintry skies.  If Kittiwake knew, he would never admit that these were the wild swans  coming from the north, which chose the darkest nights for their  migration. When my old tutor saw that I was already skilled in the use  of \"gins\" and \"springes,\" and sometimes brought in a snipe or woodcock,  his old eyes glistened as he looked upon the marsh-birds. It was on one  such occasion, pleased at my success, that he offered what he had never  offered to mortal--to teach me the whole art of fowling. I remember the  old man as he lay on his heather bench when he made this magnanimous  offer. In appearance he was a splendid type of a northern yeoman, his  face fringed with silvery hair, and cut in the finest features. One eye  was bright and clear even at his great age, though the other was rheumy,  and almost blotted out. He rarely undressed at nights, his outward garb  seemed more a production of nature than of art, and was changed, when,  like the outer cuticle of the marsh vipers, it sloughed off. It was only  in winter that the old man lived his lonely life on the mosses and  marshes, for during the summer he turned from fowler to fisher, or  assisted in the game preserves. The haunts and habits of the marsh and  shore birds he knew by heart, and his great success in taking them lay  in the fact that he was a close and accurate observer. He would watch  the fowl, then set his nets and noozes by the light of his acquired  knowledge. These things he had always known, but it was in summer, when  he was assisting at pheasant rearing, that he got to know all about  game in fur and feather. He noted that the handsome cock pheasants  always crowed before they flew up to roost; that in the evening the  partridges called as they came together in the grass lands; and he  watched the ways of the hares as they skipped in the moonlight. These  things we were wont to discuss when wild weather prevented our leaving  the hut; and all our plans were tested by experiment before they were  put into practice. It was upon these occasions, too, that the garrulous  old man would tell of his early life. That was the time for fowl; but  now the plough had invaded the sea-birds' haunt. He would tell of  immense flocks of widgeon, of banks of brent geese, and clouds of  dunlin. Bitterns used to boom and breed in the bog, and once, though  only once, a great bustard was shot. In his young days Kittiwake had  worked a decoy, as had his father and grandfather before him; and when  any stray fowler or shore-shooter told of the effect of a single shot of  their big punt-guns, he would cap their stories by going back to the  days of decoying. Although decoying had almost gone out, this was the  only subject that the old man was reticent upon, and he surrounded the  craft with all the mystery he was able to conjure up. The site of his  once famous decoy was now drained, and in summer ruddy corn waved above  it. Besides myself, Kittiwake's sole companion on the mosses was an old  shaggy galloway, and it was almost as eccentric and knowing as its  master. So great was the number of gulls and terns that bred on the  mosses, that for two months during the breeding season the old horse was  fed upon their eggs. Morning and evening a basketful was collected, and  so long as these lasted Dobbin's coat continued sleek and soft.    In August and September we would capture immense numbers of  \"flappers\"--plump wild ducks--but, as yet, unable to fly. These were  either caught in the pools, or chased into nets which we set to  intercept them. As I now took more than my share of the work, and made  all the gins, springes, and noozes which we used, a rough kind of  partnership sprung up between us. The young ducks brought us good  prices, and there was another source of income which paid well, but was  not of long duration. There is a short period in each year when even the  matured wild ducks are quite unable to fly. The male of the common wild  duck is called the mallard, and soon after his brown duck begins to sit  the drake moults the whole of its flight feathers. So sudden and  simultaneous is this process that for six weeks in summer the usually  handsome drake is quite incapable of flight, and it is probably at this  period of its ground existence that the assumption of the duck's plumage  is such an aid to protection. Quite the handsomest of the wildfowl on  the marsh were a colony of sheldrakes which occupied a number of disused  rabbit-burrows on a raised plateau overlooking the bay. The ducks were  bright chestnut, white, and purple, and in May laid from nine to a dozen  creamy eggs. As these birds brought high prices for stocking ornamental  waters, we used to collect the eggs and hatch them out under hens in the  turf cottage. This was a quite successful experiment up to a certain  point; but the young fowl, immediately they were hatched, seemed to be  able to smell the salt water, and would cover miles to gain the creek.  With all our combined watchfulness the downy ducklings sometimes  succeeded in reaching their loved briny element, and once in the sea  were never seen again. The pretty sea swallows used to breed on the  marsh, and the curious ruffs and reeves. These indulged in the strangest  flights at breeding time, and it was then that we used to capture the  greatest numbers. We took them alive in nets, and then fattened them on  soaked wheat. The birds were sent all the way to London, and brought  good prices. By being kept closely confined and frequently fed, in a  fortnight they became so plump as to resemble balls of fat, and then  brought as much as a florin a piece. If care were not taken to kill the  birds just when they attained to their greatest degree of fatness they  fell rapidly in condition,"]]]
