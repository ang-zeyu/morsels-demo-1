[Sidenote: An Object Lesson]    No better example could be instanced as to the value of camp alertness,  efficiency, the use of one's head, and the willingness to take advice. I  had with me at the time a younger brother whom I was putting through his  first paces; and Jones was to me invaluable as an object lesson.    The purpose of this chapter is not to tell you how to do things, but how  to go at them. If you can keep from getting lost, and if you can _keep  awake_, you will at least reach home safe. Other items of mental and  moral equipment you may need will come to you by natural development in  the environment to which the wild life brings you.          CHAPTER II    COMMON SENSE IN THE WILDERNESS      [Sidenote: Overburdening]    THERE is more danger that a man take too much than too little into the  wilderness. No matter how good his intentions may be, how  conscientiously he may follow advice, or how carefully he may examine  and re-examine his equipment, he will surely find that he is carrying a  great many pounds more than his companions, the professionals at the  business. At first this may affect him but little. He argues that he is  constructed on a different pattern from these men, that his training and  education are such as to have developed in him needs and habits such as  they have never known. Preconceived notions, especially when one is  fairly brought up in their influence, are most difficult to shake off.  Since we have worn coats all our lives, we include a coat in our list of  personal apparel just as unquestionably--even as unthinkingly--as we  should include in our calculations air to breathe and water to drink.  The coat is an institution so absolutely one of man's invariable  garments that it never even occurs to him to examine into its use or  uselessness. In like manner no city dweller brought up in proximity to  laundries and on the firm belief that washing should be done all at once  and at stated intervals can be convinced that he can keep clean and  happy with but one shirt; or that more than one handkerchief is a  superfluity.    [Sidenote: Elimination]    Yet in time, if he is a woodsman, and really thinks about such affairs  instead of taking them for granted, he will inevitably gravitate toward  the correct view of these things. Some day he will wake up to the fact  that he never wears a coat when working or traveling; that about camp  his sweater is more comfortable; and that in sober fact he uses that  rather bulky garment as little as any article in his outfit. So he  leaves it home, and is by so much disencumbered. In a similar manner he  will realize that with the aid of cold-water soap the shirt he wears may  be washed in one half hour and dried in the next. Meanwhile he dons his  sweater, A handkerchief is laundered complete in a quarter of an hour.  Why carry extras, then, merely from a recollection of full bureau  drawers?    [Sidenote: Essentials]    In this matter it is exceedingly difficult to be honest with oneself.  The best test is that of experience. What I have found to be of no use  to me, may measure the difference between comfort and unhappiness to  another man. Carry only essentials: but the definition of the word is  not so easy. _An essential is that which, by each man's individual  experience, he has found he cannot do without._    [Sidenote: How to Determine Essentials]    How to determine that? I have elsewhere indicated[1] a practical  expedient, which will however, bear repetition here. When you have  reached home after your trip, turn your duffle bag upside down on the  floor. Separate the contents into three piles. Let pile No. 1 include  those articles you have used every day--or nearly that often; let pile  No. 2 comprise those you have used but once; and pile No. 3 those you  have not used at all. Now, no matter how your heart may yearn over the  Patent Dingbat in No. 3, shut your eyes and resolutely discard the two  latter piles.    Naturally, if you are strong-minded, pile No. 1 will be a synonym for  your equipment. As a matter of fact you will probably not be as  strong-minded as that. You will argue to yourself somewhat in this  fashion:    \"Yes, that is all very well; but it was only a matter of sheer chance  that the Patent Dingbat is not in pile No. 1. To be sure, I did not use  it on this particular trip; but in other conditions I might need it  every day.\"    [Sidenote: The Philosophy of Duffle]    So you take it, and keep on taking it, and once in a great while you use  it. Then some day you wake up to two more bits of camp philosophy which  you formulate to yourself about as follows: _An article must pay in  convenience or comfort for the trouble of its transportation_; and  _Substitution, even imperfect, is better than the carrying of special  conveniences_. Then he hurls said Patent Dingbat into the nearest pool.    [Sidenote: Patent Dingbats]    That hits directly at the weak point of the sporting catalogues. Every  once in a while an enthusiast writes me of some new and handy kink he is  ready to swear by. It is indeed handy; and if one could pluck it from  the nearest bush when occasion for its use arose, it would be a joy and  a delight. But carrying it four hundred miles to that occasion for its  use is a very different matter. The sporting catalogues are full of very  handy kinks. They are good to fool with and think about, and plan over  in the off season; but when you pack your duffle bag you'd better put  them on a shelf.    Occasionally, but mighty seldom, you will find that something you need  very much has gone into pile No. 3. Make a note of it. But do not be too  hasty to write it down as part of your permanent equipment.    [Sidenote: You Must Not Mind Getting Wet Sometimes]    The first summer I spent in the Sierras I discovered that small noon  showers needed neither tent nor slicker. So next year I left them home,  and was, off and on, plenty wet and cold. Immediately I jumped to the  conclusion that I had made a mistake. It has not rained since. So I  decided that sporadic heavy rains do not justify the transportation of  two cumbersome articles. Now when it rains in daytime I don't mind  getting a little wet--for it is soon over; and at night an adequate  shelter can be built of the tarpaulin and a saddle blanket. In other  words the waterproofs could not pay, in the course of say three-days'  rain in a summer, for the trouble of their transportation during four  months.    As I have said, the average man, with the best intentions, will not go  too light, and so I have laid especial emphasis on the necessity of  discarding the unessential. But there exists a smaller class who rush to  the opposite extreme.    [Sidenote: Another Sort of Tenderfoot]    We all know the type. He professes an inordinate scorn for comfort of  all sorts. If you are out with him you soon discover that he has a vast  pride in being able to sleep on cobblestones--and does so at the edge of  yellow pines with their long needles. He eats badly cooked food. He  stands--or perhaps I should say poses--indifferent to a downpour when  every one else has sought shelter. In a cold climate he brings a single  thin blanket. His slogan seems to be: \"This is good enough for me!\" with  the unspoken conclusion, \"if it isn't good enough for you fellows,  you're pretty soft.\"    [Sidenote: The Tough Youth]    The queer part of it is he usually manages to bully sensible men into  his point of view. They accept his bleak camps and voluntary hardships  because they are ashamed to be less tough than he is. And in town they  are abashed before him when with a superior, good-natured, and tolerant  laugh he tells the company in glee of how you brought with you a little  pillow-case to stuff with moss. \"Bootleg is good enough for me!\" he  cries; and every one marvels at his woodsmanship.    As a plain matter of fact this man is the worse of two types of  tenderfoot. The greenhorn does not know better; but this man should. He  has mistaken utterly the problem of the wilderness. The wild life is not  to test how much the human frame can endure--although that often enough  happens--but to test how well the human wits, backed by an enduring  body, can answer the question of comfort. Comfort means minimum  equipment; comfort means bodily ease. The task is to balance, to  reconcile these apparently opposing ideas.    [Sidenote: The Logic of Woodcraft]    A man is skillful at woodcraft just in proportion as he approaches this  balance. Knowing the wilderness he can be comfortable when a less  experienced man would endure hardships. Conversely, if a man endures  hardships where a woodsman could be comfortable, it argues not his  toughness, but his ignorance or foolishness, which is exactly the case  with our blatant friend of the drawing-room reputation.    Probably no men endure more hardships than do those whose professions  call them out of doors. But they are unavoidable hardships. The cowboy  travels with a tin cup and a slicker; the cruiser with a twenty-pound  pack; the prospector with a half blanket and a sack of pilot bread--when  he has to. But on round-up, when the chuck wagon goes along, the  cow-puncher has his \"roll\"; on drive with the wangan the cruiser sends  his ample \"turkey\"; and the prospector with a burro train takes plenty  to keep him comfortable. Surely even the Tough Youth could hardly accuse  these men of being \"soft.\"    [Sidenote: Outfit Should Correspond to Means of Transportation]    You must in this matter consider what your means of transportation are  to be. It would be as foolish to confine your outfit for pack horses to  the equipment you would carry on your own back in the forests, as it  would be to limit yourself to a pack horse outfit when traveling across  country in a Pullman car. When you have horses it is good to carry a  few--a very few--canned goods.

The narrow bridge[1] would allow  but slow passage for 10,000 or 12,000 men, with all the impedimenta of war  material. Another pamphleteer[PA] says \"the King's horse were at the  rendezvous between ten and eleven; the van of the foot an hour later, and  the rear and artillery, including the Lord Lt. General's own regiment, not  until two hours after.\"    As the Parliamentarian troops take up their position upon the plain, it is  worth while to pause for a few minutes to look at the composition and  armament of the two forces. Many of the troops on both sides appear to  have been indifferently provided with weapons. Implements of warfare that  had not been in use since the Wars of the Roses--the long bow, the cross  bow, &c.--resumed their places amongst the accoutrements of the men at  arms.[a] There were the heavy horse in iron casques, breast-plates and  greaves, the musketeers with their matchlocks, and the dragoons or  dragooners,[J118] with sword and matchlock. These last seem to have been  so called from the drake, the firearm they once carried, and though not  strictly speaking cavalry, yet accompanying and supporting them. Each  regiment of Lord Essex's army carried a standard inscribed on the one side  with the watchword of the Parliament, \"God with us,\" and on the other side  the motto of the regimental commander; Lord Saye and Sele's were the blue  coats, the Commander's were orange and Lord Broke's purple; Colonel  Ballard's troops were clad in grey, Colonel Holles' in red, and Lord  Mandeville's in blue. Across his breastplate each officer of the  Parliamentary army wore an orange scarf, the commander's colour.    There were on the side of the Parliament eleven regiments of foot,  forty-two troops of horse, and 700 dragoons, numbering according to Nugent  about 13,000, though the officers in their account[PH] place their  strength as low as 10,000, which may have meant prior to the arrival of  Hampden with the artillery and rear troops. The Royalist army is stated to  have possessed 1,000 horse and 4,000 foot more;[G256] in all 14,000 foot  and 4,000 horse and dragoons--but as very few troops were of full  compliment the numbers were no doubt over estimated. The _full_ strength  of a foot regiment was 1,200, of a troop of horse about 120[x26] and of  dragooners about the same number to each company.    The Red and the Blue Regiments of the King's foot were so named from the  colour of their uniforms, the former being the King's foot guards. In  cavalry, however, it was that the Royalist army was predominant--more so,  perhaps, from the quality of the material than from any superiority of  equipment, Prince Rupert's show troop being a prominent example. Cromwell,  in a speech before Parliament,[q] bore testimony on this point, explaining  his reconstruction of the army as having arisen from the fact that \"such  base and mean fellowes,\" tapsters and serving men as they then had, not  being \"able to encounter gentlemen that had honour and courage and  resolution in them, He strove to find such as had the spirit of God in  them.\"    Towards mid-day the royalist army had occupied the whole length of the  brow of the hill between the Sun Rising and Arlescot; the left wing at the  Sun Rising, the centre at about the point where the Round House now  stands[2] and the right wing at Knowle End, where the road to Kineton  descends the hill. Well had it been for the King had the advice of so able  a soldier as Earl Lindsay prevailed at the council of war over the more  impetuous policy of Rupert. He had the strong position of the hill crest,  with convenient roads for the rapid movement of troops, and, moreover,  natural advantages which would have masked those movements. Essex would  have hesitated to risk the assault of a position of such strength,  especially when defended by a force greater than his own. These advantages  were, however, abandoned for the more dashing policy of Rupert to descend  to the plain and at once give battle. It must not be forgotten, however,  that the knowledge of the enemy's artillery with part of the army being  far in the rear,[PB] but approaching with what speed they could, and the  difficulty of provisioning the army in a hostile district,[B] would give  weight to Rupert's counsel. Brilliant cavalry officer as he undoubtedly  was, his defiance of control caused the Earl to resign his command, and  the disposition of the forces to devolve upon Earl Ruthven, and so he  decided against the King the fortunes of the then commencing war.    The Parliamentarians had in the meantime not been idle. Turning aside from  church, whither they had been going, the divines encouraged the soldiers  as they stood drawn up ready for the fight. Poor retrenchment as they were  said to have had, the ground lent itself to preparation for defence: the  thick growth of furze tied and wattled together on the gently sloping  upland: (the old phrase a \"good bush whacking\" may point to its service in  fight). Also there was the long ditch with its wet clay banks covering the  front. It is certain that a large number of the force were fighting on  their own ground and for their own homes. Evidence shows how heavy the  fight was thereabouts.    The centre consisted of three regiments of infantry, including one of the  general's, under Lord Brooke and Colonel Ballard, another regiment, under  Colonel Holles, being in the rear. These faced the Battledon Farm, about  one mile North-West of Radway, and on some rising ground to the right the  artillery was posted.    The right wing moved towards the Sun Rising. It was composed of four  brigades of horse, under Sir John Meldrum, Col. Stapleton, and Sir William  Balfore (the divisional general), with Col. Fielding's brigade and some  guns in the rear. Capt. Fiennes' regiment was with this wing, which was  covered on the right by some musketeers. Captain Oliver Cromwell fought  there also. Infantry, including the Oxfordshire Militia under Sir William  Constable and Lord Roberts, took up the intervening space between the  centre and the right wing. The cavalry of the left wing, covering the  Kineton road, was made up of twenty-four troops, under Sir James Ramsay:  the infantry in five regiments, officered by Cols. Essex and Chomley and  Lords Wharton and Mandeville, with Sir Wm. Fairfax in reserve, occupied  the ground between the cavalry and the main body. A few guns were placed  in the rear of the horse.    Imposing indeed must the sight have been in bright sunlight of that early  Sunday afternoon as the Royalist troops, began to descend the hill side!  The slopes do not appear to have been so thickly wooded as they are now,  and the unenclosed country, without the many obstacles of fence and  hedgerow,[B388] offered all that a cavalry officer could desire for the  exercise of his art and arm. Before this[PF] the King had summoned the  officers to the royal tent, and in his brief speech had said: \"My Lords  and Gentlemen here present,--If this day shine prosperously for us, we  shall be happy in a glorious victory. Your King is both your cause, your  quarrel, and your captain. The foe is in sight. Now show yourselves no  malignant parties, but with your swords declare what courage and fidelity  is within you. * * * Come life or death, your King will bear you company,  and ever keep this field, this place, and this day's service in his  grateful remembrance.\" The King,[a286] wearing a black velvet mantle  over his armour, and steel cap covered with velvet on his head, rode along  the lines of his troops and spoke to them: \"Matters are now to be declared  with swords, not by words.\"[PF] Perhaps, however, the most beautiful of  these records is that of the truly soldier-like prayer of Lord  Lindsay,[a286] \"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day; if I  forget Thee do not Thou forget me.\"      [Illustration: I    BATTLE OF EDGE HILL    (Commencement of Battle.)]      The King's centre, under General Ruthven, moved forward as far as the  village of Radway. The six columns of infantry of which it was composed  were under the divisional command of Sir Edmund Verney and Sir Jacob  Astley; Earl Lindsay and Lord Willoughby led their Lincolnshire regiment.  Between these and the right wing were eight other regiments of infantry.  The cavalry of the right wing, under Prince Rupert, commenced slowly the  steep descent of the road through Arlescot wood and the Kineton road, the  base of which is known as the Bullet Hill, and drew up there in a meadow  at the bottom of the hill.[PB] Fiennes states that the better opportunity  for the Parliamentarian attack would have been before the artillery and  rear came down the hill, which they were a long time in doing. The left  wing rested upon the Sun Rising, Col. Ennis and Col. Lisle's dragoons  covering the flank; near by were the Welsh soldiers and Carnarvon's  regiments of pikemen. In advance Wilmot's two regiments of horse were  working across the Vale of the Red Horse, Digby's reserve covering the  crest of the hill.    Lord Essex's artillery were the first to break the peace of the day, a  challenge immediately replied to by the Royalist guns near Radway. Wilmot,  of Adderbury, made the first aggressive movement in a charge upon the  Parliamentarian right, and though some success seems to have attended it,  yet it can scarcely have been of so much importance as Clarendon the  Royalist historian[B] makes out, for he writes: \"The left wing, commanded  by Wilmot, had a great success, though they had to charge in worse ground,  amongst hedges and through gaps and ditches which were lined with  musketeers. Sir A. Aston, with great courage and dexterity, beat off these  musketeers with his dragoons; and then the right wing of their horse 'was  easily dispersed, and fled the chase fearlessly.' The reserve, seeing none  of the enemy's horse left, thought there was nothing more "]]]
