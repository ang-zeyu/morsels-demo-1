It is not given  to everyone to see Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge manage a chicken  farm.    \"I was thinking of going somewhere where I could get some golf,\" I said  undecidedly.    \"Combe Regis is just the place for you, then. Perfect hot-bed of golf.  Full of the finest players. Can't throw a brick without hitting an  amateur champion. Grand links at the top of the hill not half a mile  from the farm. Bring your clubs. You'll be able to play in the  afternoons. Get through serious work by lunch time.\"    \"You know,\" I said, \"I am absolutely inexperienced as regards fowls. I  just know enough to help myself to bread sauce when I see one, but no  more.\"    \"Excellent! You're just the man. You will bring to the work a mind  unclouded by theories. You will act solely by the light of your  intelligence. And you've got lots of that. That novel of yours showed  the most extraordinary intelligence--at least as far as that blighter  at the bookstall would let me read. I wouldn't have a professional  chicken farmer about the place if he paid to come. If he applied to me,  I should simply send him away. Natural intelligence is what we want.  Then we can rely on you?\"    \"Very well,\" I said slowly. \"It's very kind of you to ask me.\"    \"Business, laddie, pure business. Very well, then. We shall catch the  eleven-twenty at Waterloo. Don't miss it. Look out for me on the  platform. If I see you first, I'll shout.\"        CHAPTER III    WATERLOO STATION, SOME FELLOW-TRAVELLERS, AND A GIRL WITH BROWN HAIR    The austerity of Waterloo Station was lightened on the following  morning at ten minutes to eleven, when I arrived to catch the train to  Combe Regis, by several gleams of sunshine and a great deal of bustle  and activity on the various platforms. A porter took my suitcase and  golf-clubs, and arranged an assignation on Number 6 platform. I bought  my ticket, and made my way to the bookstall, where, in the interests of  trade, I inquired in a loud and penetrating voice if they had got  Jeremy Garnet's \"Manoeuvres of Arthur.\" Being informed that they had  not, I clicked my tongue reproachfully, advised them to order in a  supply, as the demand was likely to be large, and spent a couple of  shillings on a magazine and some weekly papers. Then, with ten minutes  to spare, I went off in search of Ukridge.    I found him on platform six. The eleven-twenty was already alongside,  and presently I observed my porter cleaving a path towards me with the  suit-case and golf-bag.    \"Here you are!\" shouted Ukridge vigorously. \"Good for you. Thought you  were going to miss it.\"    I shook hands with the smiling Mrs. Ukridge.    \"I've got a carriage and collared two corner seats. Millie goes down in  another. She doesn't like the smell of smoke when she's travelling.  Hope we get the carriage to ourselves. Devil of a lot of people here  this morning. Still, the more people there are in the world, the more  eggs we shall sell. I can see with half an eye that all these blighters  are confirmed egg-eaters. Get in, sonnie. I'll just see the missis into  her carriage, and come back to you.\"    I entered the compartment, and stood at the door, looking out in the  faint hope of thwarting an invasion of fellow-travellers. Then I  withdrew my head suddenly and sat down. An elderly gentleman,  accompanied by a pretty girl, was coming towards me. It was not this  type of fellow traveller whom I had hoped to keep out. I had noticed  the girl at the booking office. She had waited by the side of the queue  while the elderly gentleman struggled gamely for the tickets, and I had  had plenty of opportunity of observing her appearance. I had debated  with myself whether her hair should rightly be described as brown or  golden. I had finally decided on brown. Once only had I met her eyes,  and then only for an instant. They might be blue. They might be grey. I  could not be certain. Life is full of these problems.    \"This seems to be tolerably empty, my dear Phyllis,\" said the elderly  gentleman, coming to the door of the compartment and looking in.  \"You're sure you don't object to a smoking-carriage?\"    \"Oh no, father. Not a bit.\"    \"Then I think ...\" said the elderly gentleman, getting in.    The inflection of his voice suggested the Irishman. It was not a  brogue. There were no strange words. But the general effect was Irish.    \"That's good,\" he said, settling himself and pulling out a cigar case.    The bustle of the platform had increased momentarily, until now, when,  from the snorting of the engine, it seemed likely that the train might  start at any minute, the crowd's excitement was extreme. Shrill cries  echoed down the platform. Lost sheep, singly and in companies, rushed  to and fro, peering eagerly into carriages in search of seats. Piercing  voices ordered unknown \"Tommies\" and \"Ernies\" to \"keep by aunty, now.\"  Just as Ukridge returned, that _sauve qui peut_ of the railway crowd,  the dreaded \"Get in anywhere,\" began to be heard, and the next moment  an avalanche of warm humanity poured into the carriage.    The newcomers consisted of a middle-aged lady, addressed as Aunty, very  stout and clad in a grey alpaca dress, skin-tight; a youth called  Albert, not, it was to appear, a sunny child; a niece of some twenty  years, stolid and seemingly without interest in life, and one or two  other camp-followers and retainers.    Ukridge slipped into his corner, adroitly foiling Albert, who had made  a dive in that direction. Albert regarded him fixedly and reproachfully  for a space, then sank into the seat beside me and began to chew  something that smelt of aniseed.    Aunty, meanwhile, was distributing her substantial weight evenly  between the feet of the Irish gentleman and those of his daughter, as  she leaned out of the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw  hat and hair curlers, accompanied by three dirty and frivolous boys. It  was, she stated, lucky that she had caught the train. I could not agree  with her. The girl with the brown hair and the eyes that were neither  blue or grey was bearing the infliction, I noticed, with angelic calm.  She even smiled. This was when the train suddenly moved off with a  jerk, and Aunty, staggering back, sat down on the bag of food which  Albert had placed on the seat beside him.    \"Clumsy!\" observed Albert tersely.    \"_Albert_, you mustn't speak to Aunty so!\"    \"Wodyer want to sit on my bag for then?\" said Albert disagreeably.    They argued the point. Argument in no wise interfered with Albert's  power of mastication. The odour of aniseed became more and more  painful. Ukridge had lighted a cigar, and I understood why Mrs. Ukridge  preferred to travel in another compartment, for      \"In his hand he bore the brand     Which none but he might smoke.\"    I looked across the carriage stealthily to see how the girl was  enduring this combination of evils, and noticed that she had begun to  read. And as she put the book down to look out of the window, I saw  with a thrill that trickled like warm water down my spine that her book  was \"The Manoeuvres of Arthur.\" I gasped. That a girl should look as  pretty as that and at the same time have the rare intelligence to read  Me ... well, it seemed an almost superhuman combination of the  excellencies. And more devoutly than ever I cursed in my heart these  intrusive outsiders who had charged in at the last moment and destroyed  for ever my chance of making this wonderful girl's acquaintance. But  for them, we might have become intimate in the first half hour. As it  was, what were we? Ships that pass in the night! She would get out at  some beastly wayside station, and vanish from my life without my ever  having even spoken to her.    Aunty, meanwhile, having retired badly worsted from her encounter with  Albert, who showed a skill in logomachy that marked him out as a future  labour member, was consoling herself with meat sandwiches. The niece  was demolishing sausage rolls. The atmosphere of the carriage was  charged with a blend of odours, topping all Ukridge's cigar, now in  full blast.    The train raced on towards the sea. It was a warm day, and a torpid  peace began to settle down upon the carriage. Ukridge had thrown away  the stump of his cigar, and was now leaning back with his mouth open  and his eyes shut. Aunty, still clutching a much-bitten section of a  beef sandwich, was breathing heavily and swaying from side to side.  Albert and the niece were dozing, Albert's jaws working automatically,  even in sleep.    \"What's your book, my dear?\" asked the Irishman.    \"'The Manoeuvres of Arthur,' father. By Jeremy Garnet.\"    I would not have believed without the evidence of my ears that my name  could possibly have sounded so musical.    \"Molly McEachern gave it to me when I left the Abbey. She keeps a shelf  of books for her guests when they are going away. Books that she  considers rubbish, and doesn't want, you know.\"    I hated Miss McEachern without further evidence.    \"And what do you think of it?\"    \"I like it,\" said the girl decidedly. The carriage swam before my eyes.  \"I think it is very clever.\"    What did it matter after that that the ass in charge of the Waterloo  bookstall had never heard of \"The Manoeuvres of Arthur,\" and that my  publishers, whenever I slunk in to ask how it was selling, looked at me  with a sort of grave, paternal pity and said that it had not really  \"begun to move?\" Anybody can write one of those rotten popular novels  which appeal to the unthinking public, but it takes a man of intellect  and refinement and taste and all that sort of thing to turn out  something that will be approved of by a girl like this.    \"I wonder who Jeremy Garnet is,\" she said. \"I've never heard of him  before. I imagine him rather an old young man, probably with an  eyeglass, and conceited.

From _B. brachygnathus_, _B.  kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 and jaw larger; diastema longer;  masseteric ridge not so far forward; molars more depressed.    From _B. minimus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 larger;  jaw larger; diastema not so acutely curved; incisor shorter, narrower  transversely, more prooedont.    From _B. musculus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: anterior median fold of m1  slightly developed or absent, instead of well-developed; m3 larger (not  reduced), external reentrant valley broad and extending farther across  crown of tooth; incisor smaller, and more prooedont; cingular ridges of  m1 and m2 less well-developed.

The anterior median  fold is well-developed in all species of _Baiomys_ save _B.  brachygnathus_ and _B. taylori_, in which the fold is only slightly  developed or absent. _B. kolbi_ may have paralleled _B. taylori_ in  specialization for a diet of grasses and for a life in open country.      =Baiomys brachygnathus= (Gidley)        _Peromyscus brachygnathus_ Gidley, U.

From _B. minimus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs  in: jaw not so slender anteriorly; masseteric ridge not so far anterior;  cheek-teeth slightly broader, less depressed, therefore, more hypsodont;  incisor shorter, more prooedont.    From _B. sawrockensis_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: molar row  slightly longer; teeth slightly less depressed; masseteric ridge extends  farther anteriorly; incisors more prooedont.    From _B. musculus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: jaw smaller; molar  row slightly shorter; molars less depressed; incisors slender, shorter,  narrower, and more prooedont.    From _B. taylori_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: incisor more slender,  shorter, more prooedont; diastema shorter.    _Remarks._--The molar teeth of _B. brachygnathus_, although worn,  resemble those of _B. taylori_ more than those of any known fossil  species. Gidley (1922:124) stated that the absence of the divided  anterior lobe of the first molar (anterior median fold) in  _brachygnathus_ was one of the chief characters separating  _brachygnathus_ from _taylori_. In _taylori_, the anterior median fold  characteristically is only slightly developed, and in some specimens is  absent. _B. brachygnathus_ differs from _taylori_ chiefly in prooedont  incisors, which feature seems to preclude _brachygnathus_ being  ancestral to _taylori_. _B. brachygnathus_ may have been a specialized  divergence from _B. minimus_.      =Baiomys minimus= (Gidley)        _Peromyscus minimus_ Gidley, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Papers,         131:124, March 15, 1922.        _Baiomys minimus_, Hibbard, Amer. Midland Nat., 26:352, September,         1941; Gazin, Prof. U. S. Nat. Mus., 92(3155):488, 1942.        _P. [eromyscus] minimus_, Wilson, Carnegie Inst. Washington Publ.,         473:33, May 21, 1936.    _Type._--No. 10500, U. S. Nat.

S Benson, sec. 22, T. 17 S, R. 20 E, Late Pliocene  (Blancan, Gazin, 1942:482), Cochise County, Arizona.    _Referred material._--None.    _Diagnosis._--Ramus small for the genus; molar teeth depressed; cingular  ridges (ectolophids) of m1 and m2 well-developed; anterior median fold  present (appearing larger owing to chip of enamel missing); external  reentrant fold of m3 progresses half way across crown of tooth; diastema  short; incisor moderately large, recurved; length of molar row, 2.6 mm.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. brachygnathus_, _B. kolbi_, and  _B. sawrockensis_, see accounts of those species. From _B. rexroadi_,  _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold deeper; incisor longer,  more recurved, less prooedont; molars slightly more depressed (though  worn).    From _B. musculus_, _B. minimus_ differs in: over-all size of jaw and  molars smaller; incisors shorter; masseteric ridge more depressed.    From _B. taylori_, _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold  slightly deeper; molar teeth more depressed; cingular ridges on m1 and  m2 better developed; masseteric ridge more depressed.    _Remarks._--Gidley (1922:124) stated that _B. minimus_ differed  considerably from _B. taylori_ in that the coronoid portion of the  ascending ramus diverges at a wider angle from the alveolar part of the  jaw. Study of large samples of lower jaws of _B. taylori_ reveals  considerable individual variation in the angle formed between the  coronoid part of the jaw and the alveolar part.    _B. minimus_, except for its small size, is like _B. musculus_ and is  considered to be ancestral to that species.          PHYLETIC TRENDS      It seems that the important trends in phyletic development in the pygmy  mice have been from an ancestral stock (see Figure 3) that possessed  relatively brachydont teeth having raised cingular ridges (ectolophids  and mesolophids) and relatively short orthodont to prooedont incisors, to  species having teeth more hypsodont on which cingular ridges were  reduced, stylids were isolated or completely absent, and incisors were  longer and more recurved or retrodont. _Baiomys sawrockensis_, or an  unknown stock resembling it, might have been ancestral to the other  known species. Of the four remaining fossil species, _B. kolbi_ seems  least likely to have been ancestral to the two living species, owing to  its prooedont incisors, reduction of cingular ridges, loss of an anterior  median fold in m1, and long mandibular tooth-row. _B. kolbi_ may have  been an early, specialized derivation from the ancestral stock.
