Whence came the idea? This is now _the question_. In answering it I  shall assume no ground but that which all parties say is true. The  Christian, the Deist and Atheist will admit that we have learned all we  know, and that we have learned only through the aid of the five senses:  seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting and smelling are the porters of the  mind. One or another of these bring to the mind every thought that it  receives. We obtain thoughts of odor _only_ by the sense of smell; of  flavor only by the taste; of color by the eye alone. In these matters we  have no intuition. We brought no ideas into the world with us. In all  these things we are creatures of education. Simple or single ideas, like  simple words, represent simple thoughts or realities, and compound ideas  represent compound thoughts or realities. Therefore it follows that  every thought comes from a corresponding reality. To deny this is equal  to the affirmation that we can clearly see objects in a vacuum, that we  can see something where there is nothing.    Having stated premises in which all are agreed, I now state my first  proposition:    THERE IS A TRUE AND LIVING GOD.    In sustaining this proposition I shall introduce no witnesses but those  whose perfect reliability is vouched for by the Atheist himself; so we  shall have no dispute concerning the credibility and perfect reliability  of witnesses. For the Atheist, claiming to be a votary of reason, as  well as a boasted free and fearless thinker, certainly can not impeach  the testimony of his own mind. And, being a free and fearless thinker,  he will not try to conceal or prevent the witness, when on the stand,  from telling the whole truth. I am now ready for the evidence.    The scene changes; Christian is alone in his studio, and a rap is heard  at the door. It is opened, and Mr. Atheist is invited to enter, and  being seated, Christian addresses him thus:    Mr. Atheist, I am glad you have called, and if you have the leisure time  and are perfectly free to do so, I would like to talk with you on the  evidence of the existence of God.    _Atheist_--I am not only willing, but as anxious as you can be to  examine this question.    _Christian_--Very well. I suppose you have examined the evidence in the  premises, and from all the testimony, carefully analyzed, made your  decision.    _Atheist_--You do me justice in thus supposing, for I claim to be a  reasonable being, and to follow fearlessly the lamp of reason; and,  doing this on scientific and philosophic principles, I have become  satisfied that there is no God.    _Christian_--Will you allow me to state my analysis of the mind and ask  you if it is correct?    _Atheist_--You, Mr. C., are approaching from a singular yet a pleasing  stand-point; will you please give me your analysis? If it is good, I  will say so; if defective, I will point out its errors.    _Christian_--It is this: The mind of man may be divided into ten parts  or powers; five external, or the five senses; and five internal. The  external I need not name. The internal may be presented thus: First,  perception; second, reflection; third, memory; fourth, reason; fifth,  judgment, or decision; each of these entirely dependent upon its  immediate predecessor for support and action. We can not judge of that  upon which we have not reasoned, nor reason where we have not  remembered, nor remember that of which we have not first thought;  neither can we think of that which we have not perceived, nor perceive  without the action of some one of the five senses.    _Atheist_--I admire your analysis--it is scientific; but, Mr. C., I  should not think that you, with your present belief in the existence of  God, would adopt this system of mental philosophy.    _Christian_--Why?    _Atheist_--_Did you ever see a God?_    _Christian_--If you please, I will test the question with you, and, in  order to do so, I will personify these powers. I will suppose them to  represent ten men, all of whom are Atheists, and we will rely upon their  testimony.    _Atheist_--That is an honorable offer; I will accept it most cordially.    _Christian_--Then, we are to consider the powers of the mind as so many  men, and hear their testimony?    _Atheist_--Yes.    _Christian_--Will you examine the witnesses?    _Atheist_--You would more properly do that; I wish to hear you.    _Christian_--Very well; I will, then, call on Mr. Judgment, and ask,  Have you given a decision on the question of the existence of God, and  if so, what is your decision?    _Judgment_--There is no such being.    _Christian_--Tell us whether you created the idea of a God, or brought  it into the world with you, and how you obtained the material from which  you manufactured your verdict?    _Judgment_--\"Did I bring the idea into the world with me, or create it?\"  _What a question!_ Had anybody but a Christian asked it I would have  thought it an insult; but, then, Christians are never thinkers. You  ought to have known that the thought could not have been created by me.  To say I created it would be an endorsement of your foolish idea that  _something_ was made of _nothing_. I have no creative power, much less  the power _to make something out of nothing_; neither did I bring it  into the world with me. _We have no innate ideas._    _Christian_--Then where did you get the material from which you made  your decision that there is no God?    _Judgment_--\"_Where!_\" I have but one porter, Mr. Reason. He gives all  the material upon which I ever act. If you doubt this try and judge of  anything upon which you have never reasoned. If you can not do this you  must agree with me that judgment can only act and decide by the aid of  reason.    _Christian_--Your argument is conclusive. Now, as you have decided that  there is no God, and also claim that your only aid, Mr. Reason, gave you  the material out of which you made your decision, will you call him and  allow me to ask him a few questions?    _Judgment_--Most willingly. We all are free thinkers, and delight in  investigation. Brother Reason, please call in; Christian is here and  wishes a little information of you.    _Reason_--Mr. Christian, Brother Judgment informs me that you wish some  information from me. Please state your question.    _Christian_--Did you present the idea of the existence of God to your  brother Judgment, and if so, where and how did you come by it?    _Reason_--I received it from Brother Memory, and opened it out and held  it up so that Brother Judgment could scan it thoroughly, and he decided  there was no such being, and I agree with him.    _Christian_--Will you call Memory, that I may learn where and how he  obtained the idea? (_Memory enters._)    _Christian_--Mr. Memory, are you an Atheist, and did you give Reason the  idea of a God? If you did, how did you get it? Did you bring it into the  world with you?    _Memory_--\"Bring it into the world with me.\" _What an absurd question!_  I never had an idea only as it was given me by Brother Reflection. If  you doubt this, try and remember something you have never thought of, or  think of something you never perceived. This, then, is the truth:  Reflection received the idea from Perception and gave it to you, and you  gave it to Memory, and he held it up to the eye of Reason, who, with  your aid, spread it out before the mind of your brother Judgment, and he  gave the decision, that there is no God; so we are all Atheists. Have  you any more questions?    _Christian_--Yes, one more at least; I wish _now_ to know how your  brother Perception obtained the idea of a God--will you tell me, or call  him?    _Memory_--Oh, I can tell you; he has five porters who bring him all he  ever gets, and they, with us, are all Atheists. But one or another of  these must have brought him the idea.    _Christian_--Will you ask them which one gave it to your brother  Perception?    _Memory_--You, for some reason, are very particular. I will, however, to  gratify you, call them, or at least some of them. Brother Eye, Christian  wishes to know if you gave the idea of a God to Mr. Perception?    _Eye_--_What a foolish question!_ You, an Atheist, ask me, another  Atheist, if I have ever seen a living God where there is none to look  at--you have let Christian lead you out until he has almost drawn from  you the proof that David told the truth about us when he called all  Atheists fools. I have seen all visible things, but _nothing_ is too  small a mark for me to discover!    _Christian_--Mr. Eye, don't be in a hurry; just let me ask, do Free  Thinkers get scared and refuse to think?    _Eye_--I will leave you now, and tell the other porters what a fix your  philosophy has led us into.    _Christian_--Good-bye; I will call one month hence and hear your  conclusion.          DO WE NEED THE BIBLE?      The only creed consistent with the rejection of the Gospel of Christ is  an eternal tomb, with the heart-shivering inscription, \"Death is an  eternal sleep.\" Americans who reject the Scriptures are as uncertain  about the future as the poor heathen of other lands. Some of our  unbelievers have gathered the information from heathen oracles that the  future consists in being a poor, empty, shivering, table-rapping spirit,  flying to and fro over the country in response to the sigh of some silly  waiting-girl, or at the bidding of some brazen-faced, unscrupulous \"free  lover.\" And this, \"O, ye gods!\" is all that ever shall be of the noblest  spirits that ever left human flesh! Others, to gain rest from this  horrible and unsatisfying fate, fly to the theory of everlasting  silence, as a result of the idea that mind is simply brain action, and  ceases to exist when the brain ceases to act. Their appropriate motto  is, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" It has been said that  even this brute philosophy is reasonable compared with the dogma of a  large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28669"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. 8, (#3)"],[1,"?    _Atheists_--It is a compound idea. It is simply the blending of the idea  of each single flower.    _Christian_--And this is all the imagination can do? Then, gentlemen, do  you not see that as the idea of God is the idea of a single person, it  would be utterly impossible for imagination to be its author? It is not  a conglomerate idea, but a single one. Now, if there is no God, we have  a clear, definite idea of _nothing_. How will you account for this? Are  you not now unable to give a reason for your premises? Is it not the  truth that fools are wiser in their own conceit than men who can give a  reason?    _Atheists_--Mr. Christian, we did not think that you would thus call us  all fools, and as our investigation has taken such an unlooked for turn,  we must ask time for consultation before we proceed further.    _Christian_--Very well. When will you be ready to resume? this I am  anxious to know; as you are \"liberalists\" and \"free-thinkers,\" you will  be equally anxious to reach the truth in the premises?    _Atheists_--At two P.M.    It is two o'clock, and all are present.    Mr. Reason, who was an atheist, opens the discussion as follows:    \"Mr. Christian, we have held a council on the subject under discussion,  and our conclusion is that you are right. There must be, and is, such a  being as God. Were this not so, we never could have had the idea of him.  We are now deists. We deny that he has ever imparted knowledge to man by  revelation.\"    _Christian_--Gentlemen, do you think your present position is a  scientific one?    _Deists_--We think it is both scientific and invulnerable, and we also  think that if you continue this investigation with us you will find it  so. How did you obtain this idea? Have you seen God? No. Have you heard  him speak? No. If we had we could not be honest without being  Christians?    _Christian_--Gentlemen, have you not contraband goods in your warehouse?  As your eyes have not seen, nor your ears heard, nor your powers of  observation perceived him, and as you acknowledge that every one of your  ideas entered the mind through the aid of one or another of the five  senses, now, I ask, are you logically any better off than before you  found yourselves obliged to relinquish your atheism? Do you not now, as  well as then, occupy unreasonable ground? Having rather conceded that  atheists are fools, and turned _deists_, are you really any better off?  Can you give a reason for your present infidelity? Out of your own  mouths you stand condemned as unreasonable and foolish. You pretend to  venerate reason, while you discard her first principles. You need not  try to evade me at this point by an appeal to nature. Here you can find  no aid, for nature tells us of no first cause. The apple tree, before  this window, now so richly laden with fruit, tells not of its first  cause. If you say it came from an apple-seed, and that from an apple,  and that from another tree, another seed, and another tree, and so on,  in a circle you may always go, for nature does not tell you of a first  tree as a cause uncaused, nor of a Creator, a God. She does not go  behind herself. Gentlemen, have you any reply? If you have, I would like  to hear it.    Reason timidly says: \"Mr. C., in your very severe strictures on the  deists, are you not condemning yourself? You pretend to place full  confidence in the teachings of your Bible, and does it not say: 'The  heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his  handiwork?' Can nature thus declare and not make known?\"    _Christian_--Yes, your quotation tells the truth; yet in this also you  have taken too much for granted. There stands a clock; it keeps correct  time, but does it declare the glory of any one?    _Deists_--Yes, that of its maker.    _Christian_--But who was its maker. You say you do not know. That is  true, and, for ought you know, or can learn from its mechanism there  might have been several makers connected with its origin. If you had  stood by and seen it made, then you might have told me all about it. In  that which you call the works of nature, neither you, nor I, nor any of  our fellows, are instructed by actual observation consequent upon being  present when they were made--we were not standing by when the heavens  were made; so that source of information is closed up. There is now but  one resort left to us--but one reasonable means of information. That is,  the maker of all things must, necessarily, have told man that he created  all these things. Then, with David, he could sing, \"The heavens declare  the glory of God.\" Man first learned from God that he was the creator of  all things, for God alone could tell it. Gentlemen, the Christian is  the only reasonable being upon the earth, and the only _fearless  free-thinker_. The atheist, you see, is proved a fool, and the deist is  no better. Think this over, then call again.    _Deists_--We will. _Good evening._          THOMAS PAINE    WAS NOT AN INFIDEL WHEN HE WROTE HIS WORK CALLED COMMON SENSE.      \"In the early ages of the world, according to the Scripture chronology,  there were no kings, the consequence of which was there were no wars. It  is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confusion. Holland,  without a king, hath enjoyed more peace for the last century than any of  the monarchical governments of Europe. Antiquity favors the same remark,  for the quiet and rural lives of the first patriarchs have a happy  something in them which vanishes when we come to the history of Jewish  royalty.\" (Common Sense, p. 12.)    Mr. Paine, did the God of the Bible approve of the Jewish royalty?    _Ans._ \"As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest can not be  justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be defended  on the authority of Scripture; for the will of the Almighty, as declared  by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves of government by  kings.\" * * * Near three thousand years passed away, from the Mosaic  account of the creation, until the Jews, under the national delusion,  requested a king. Till then their form of government (except in  extraordinary cases, where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of  republic, administered by a judge and the elders of the tribes. King  they had none, and it was held sinful to acknowledge any being under the  title but Lord of Hosts. * * * Monarchy is ranked in Scripture as one  of the sins of the Jews, for which a curse in reserve is denounced  against them. The history of that transaction is worth attending to. The  children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon marched  against them with a small army, and victory, through the divine  interposition, decided in his favor. The Jews, elate with success, and  attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed making him a king,  saying, \"_Rule thou over us, thou and thy son, and thy son's son._\" Here  was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only, but an  hereditary one. But Gideon, in the piety of his soul, replied, \"_I will  not rule over you; neither shall my son rule over you._ THE LORD SHALL  RULE OVER YOU.\" (Common Sense, pp. 13 and 14.)    How many Gideons are there among leading infidels whose soul-piety would  resist such a temptation as that? Say, was Thomas Paine an infidel when  he wrote that?    \"In short, monarchy and succession have laid, not this or that kingdom  only, but the world in blood and ashes. 'Tis a form of government which  the word of God bears testimony against, and blood will attend it.\"  (Common Sense, p. 19.) \"'But where,' say some, 'is the king of America?'  I'll tell you, friend; he reigns above, and doth not make havoc of  mankind like the royal brute of Britain. Yet, that we may not appear to  be defective in earthly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for  proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth, placed on the divine  law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world  may know that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America _the law  is king_.\" (Common Sense, p. 33.)    After quoting sundry passages of Scripture against a kingly form of  government, Thomas Paine says:    \"These portions of Scripture are direct and positive. They admit of no  equivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his protest  against monarchical government is true, or the Scripture is false. And a  man hath good reason to believe that there is as much of kingcraft as  priestcraft in withholding the Scripture from the public in popish  countries.\" (Common Sense, p. 15.)    From the foregoing _verbatim_ quotations it will be seen that Thomas  Paine was no infidel until he PARTED WITH \"COMMON SENSE,\" which bears  date of February 14, 1776. Common Sense is of noble worth. We cheerfully  concede to Thomas Paine all the honor due him for services rendered in  behalf of our country while he was Thomas Paine the Quaker. He did  nothing for our country after he avowed his infidelity that deserves  being mentioned by any intelligent Christian.          A CLUSTER OF THOUGHTS,    GATHERED FROM JENYN'S INTERNAL EVIDENCES, WITH ADDITIONS AND  MODIFICATIONS.      When the religion of Christ made its appearance it was entirely new,  infinitely above, and altogether different from any other which had at  any time entered into the mind of man. Its object was new. It was to  prepare us with fitness of character, through a state of trial, for  mutual association with the pure and lovely in the kingdom of heaven.  This is presented in all the gospel, as the chief end of the Christian's  life. Until Christ, no such reward was offered to mankind, nor means  provided for its attainment.    Many of the philosophers in old times had ideas of a future state, but  they were mixed with a great deal of uncertainty and misgivings.    Ancient legislators endeavored to inculcate the idea of rewards and  punishments after death, to give sanction to their laws."]]]
