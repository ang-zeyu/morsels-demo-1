(Foregoing combination of characters distinguishing _S. baudini_ from  any other species in genus.)    _Description and Variation._--Considerable variation in size, and in  certain proportions and structural characters was observed; variation in  some characters seems to show geographic trends, whereas variation in  other characters apparently is random. Noticeable variation is evident  in coloration, but this will be discussed later.    In order to analyze geographic variation in size and proportions, ten  adult males from each of 14 samples from various localities throughout  the range of the species were measured. Snout-vent length, length of the  tibia in relation to snout-vent length, and relative size of the  tympanum to the eye are the only measurements and proportions that vary  noticeably (Table 1). The largest specimens are from southern Sinaloa;  individuals from the Atlantic lowlands of Alta Verapaz in Guatemala,  Honduras, and Costa Rica are somewhat smaller, and most specimens from  the Pacific lowlands of Central America are slightly smaller than those  from the Atlantic lowlands. The smallest males are from the Atlantic  lowlands of Mexico, including Tamaulipas, Veracruz, the Yucatan  Peninsula, and British Honduras.

One  of these elder sons was Sir James's grandfather, the late Dr. Edward  Johnstone of Edgbaston Hall, who had married the heiress of Fulford,  but was left a widower in 1800. Dr. Edward Johnstone was remarried  in 1802 to Miss Pearson of Tettenhall, and of their two sons, the  younger, James, born in 1806, practised for many years as a physician,  and was President of the British Medical Association when it met  in Birmingham in 1856. His eldest son, the subject of this notice,  was born in a house now pulled down in the Old Square, Birmingham,  on February 9th, 1841. Brought up in the midst of the large family of  brothers and sisters, whose childhood was passed between their home  in the Old Square and their grandfather's residence at Edgbaston Hall,  where they spent the summer and autumn: he used also to look back with  particular pleasure on his visits to his maternal grandfather's country  house, where he first mounted a pony. His mother was his instructor,  except occasional lessons from the Rev. T. Price, till at the age of  nine he entered King Edward's Classical School, of which his father  was a governor. The head master at that time (1850), was the Rev. (now  Archdeacon) E. H. Gifford, D.D., and in the school list for 1852,  Johnstone senior is placed next in the same class to Mackenzie (now  Sir Alex.), the present Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.    In 1855, young James Johnstone went to a military college in Paris,  which was swept away before 1870, with a great part of the older  portion of the city. After a year and a half in Paris he was  transferred to the Royal Naval and Military Academy, Gosport, and  a few months later qualified for one of the last cadetships given  under the old East India Company. Without delay he proceeded to  India, which was at that period distracted by the Indian Mutiny,  so that his regiment the 68th Bengal Native Infantry, consisted only  of officers attached to different European regiments, or acting in a  civil capacity. With the 73rd (Queen's Regiment) he marched through  the country, and was actively employed in the suppression of the  insurgents, after which he was stationed for some time in Assam where  he also saw active service. There, in 1862, he met with the accident  he alludes to on pp. 3 and 20. It came in the course of his duty, as  the population of a village which had been disarmed had sent to the  nearest military post to ask for assistance against a tiger (panther),  causing destruction in the neighbourhood; but he was very much hurt,  and the weakening effects of this accident, seem to have predisposed  him to attacks of the malaria fever of the district, from which he  frequently suffered afterwards.    His next post was at Keonjhur, where there had been an outbreak  against the Rajah by some of the hill-tribes and the chief insurgent  had been executed. Lieutenant Johnstone was appointed special  assistant to the superintendent of the Tributary Mehals at Cuttack,  in whose official district Keonjhur lies. The Superintendent wrote  to the Lieutenant-Governor (Sir William Grey) of Bengal in 1869:  \"Captain Johnstone has acquired their full confidence, and hopes  very shortly to be able to dispense with the greater part of the  Special Police Force posted at Keonjhur. He appears to take very  great interest in his work, and is sanguine of success.\" The same  official when enclosing Captain Johnstone's first report, wrote:  \"It contains much interesting matter regarding the people, and shows  that he has taken great pains in bringing them into the present  peaceable and apparently loyal condition,\" and a little further on,  when describing an interview he had with the Rajah: \"From the manner  in which he spoke of Captain Johnstone, I was exceedingly glad to  find that the most good feeling exists between them.\" He also adds,  apropos of a recommendation that the Government should pay half the  expense of the special commission instead of charging it all on the  native state: \"Nearly one half of Captain Johnstone's time has been  occupied in Khedda (catching wild elephants) operations, which have  been successful and profitable to Government, and totally unconnected  with that officer's duty in Keonjhur.\" [3]    A year later the superintendent (T. E. Ravenshaw, Esq.) reports:  \"Captain Johnstone, with his usual liberality and tact, has clothed  two thousand naked savages, and has succeeded in inducing them to wear  the garments;\" and again, \"Captain Johnstone's success in establishing  schools has been most marked, and there are now nine hundred children  receiving a rudimentary education.... Captain Johnstone has very  correctly estimated the political importance of education and  enlightenment among the hill people, and it is evident that he has  worked most judiciously and successfully in this direction.\" And again:  \"In the matter of improvement of breed of cattle, Captain Johnstone  has, at his own expense, formed a valuable herd of sixty cows and  several young bulls ready to extend the experiment.... Captain  Johnstone's experiments on rice and flax cultivation have been  very successful\" (two years later this is attributed to his having  superintended them himself). The official report sums up, \"Of Captain  Johnstone I cannot speak too highly; his management has been efficient,  and he has exercised careful and constant supervision over the Rajah  and his estate, in a manner which has resulted in material improvement  to both.\"    Subsequently, when Captain Johnstone was on leave in England, the  Keonjhur despatches show that he sent directions that the increase of  his herd of cattle should be distributed gratis among the natives. They  were at first afraid to accept them, hardly believing in the gift.    \"Keonjhur,\" says the Government report of India for 1870-1, \"continues  under the able administration of Captain Johnstone, who, it will be  remembered, was mainly instrumental in restoring the country to quiet  three years ago.\"    Captain Johnstone was too good a classic not to remember the Roman  method of conquering and subduing a province; and as far as funds  would permit, he opened out roads and cleared away jungle. But he  suffered again from the malaria so prevalent in the forest districts  of India, and took three months' furlough in 1871, which meant just  one month in England. Although he had lost his father in May, 1869,  and his absence from home that year gave him some extra legal expense,  he would not quit his work till he could leave it in a satisfactory  state; yet the Lieut.-Governor of Bengal (Sir George Campbell) twice  referred to this furlough as being \"most unfortunate,\" particularly  as it had to be repeated within a few months. The superintendent  wrote from Cuttack in his yearly report to the Lieut.-Governor:  \"Captain Johnstone's serious and alarming illness necessitated his  taking sick leave to England in August, 1871. He had only a short  time previously returned from furlough, and with health half restored,  over-tasked his strength in carrying out elephant Khedda work in the  deadly jungles of Moburdhunj.\"    In the spring of 1872, Captain Johnstone was married to Emma Mary  Lloyd, with whose family his own had a hereditary friendship of  three generations. Her father was at that time M.P. for Plymouth,  and living at Moor Hall in Warwickshire. Their first child, James,  died of bronchitis when six months old, and they returned to India  a short time afterwards, at which point the experiences begin. Their  second child, Richard, was born at Samagudting, and is now a junior  officer in the battalion of the 60th King's Own Royal Rifles, quartered  in India. The third son, Edward, was born at Dunsley Manor, and two  younger children in Manipur.    Manipur, to which Colonel Johnstone was appointed in 1877, was  called by one of the Indian secretaries the Cinderella among  political agencies. \"They'll never,\" he said, \"get a good man to  take it.\" \"Well,\" was the reply, \"a good man has taken it now.\" The  loneliness, the surrounding savages, and the ill-feeling excited by  the Kubo valley (which so late as 1852 is placed in Manipur, in maps  published in Calcutta) having been made over to Burmah, were among the  reasons of its unpopularity. Colonel Johnstone's predecessor, Captain  Durand (now Sir Edward) draws a very glaring picture in his official  report for 1877, of the Maharajah's misgovernment; the wretched  condition of the people, and the most unpleasant position of the  Political Agent, whom he described as \"in fact a British officer under  Manipur surveillance.... He is surrounded by spies.... If the Maharajah  is not pleased with the Political Agent he cannot get anything--he is  ostracised. From bad coarse black atta, which the Maharajah sells him  as a favour, to the dhoby who washes his clothes, and the Nagas who  work in his garden, he cannot purchase anything.\" Yet, well knowing all  this, Colonel Johnstone readily accepted the post, confident that with  his great knowledge of Eastern languages, and of Eastern customs and  modes of thought, he should be able to bring about a better state of  things, both as regarded the oppressed inhabitants and the permanent  influence of the representative of the British Government. Whether  this confidence was justified, the following pages will show.                                                                       EDITOR.
