The other piece is a tin  camp-kettle, also of the heaviest tin, and seamed water-tight. It holds  two quarts, and the other dishes nest in it perfectly, so that when  packed the whole takes just as much room as the kettle alone. I should  mention that the strong ears are set below the rim of the kettle, and  the bale falls outside, so, as none of the dishes have any handle, there  are no aggravating \"stickouts\" to wear and abrade. The snug affair  weighs, all told, two pounds. I have met parties in the North Woods  whose one frying pan weighed more--with its handle three feet long. How  ever did they get through the brush with such a culinary terror?    It is only when I go into a very accessible camp that I take so much as  five pieces of tinware along. I once made a ten days' tramp through an  unbroken wilderness on foot, and all the dish I took was a ten-cent tin;  it was enough. I believe I will tell the story of that tramp before I  get through. For I saw more game in the ten days than I ever saw before  or since in a season; and I am told that the whole region is now a  thrifty farming country, with the deer nearly all gone. They were plenty  enough thirty-nine years ago this very month.    [Sidenote: _Rods_]    I feel more diffidence in speaking of rods than of any other matter  connected with out-door sports. The number and variety of rods and  makers; the enthusiasm of trout and fly \"cranks\"; the fact that angling  does not take precedence of all other sports with me, with the  humiliating confession that I am not above bucktail spinners, worms and  sinkers, minnow tails and white grubs--this and these constrain me to be  brief.    But, as I have been a fisher all my life, from my pinhook days to the  present time; as I have run the list pretty well up, from brook minnows  to 100-pound albacores, I may be pardoned for a few remarks on the rod  and the use thereof.    A rod may be a very high-toned, high-priced aesthetic plaything, costing  $50 to $75, or it may be--a rod. A serviceable and splendidly balanced  rod can be obtained from first class makers for less money. By all means  let the man of money indulge his fancy for the most costly rod that can  be procured. He might do worse. A practical every day sportsman whose  income is limited will find that a more modest product will drop his  flies on the water quite as attractively to _Salmo fontinalis_. My  little 8-1/2-foot, 4-3/4-ounce split bamboo which the editor of _Forest  and Stream_ had made for me cost $10.00. I have given it hard usage and  at times large trout have tested it severely, but it has never failed  me. The dimensions of my second rod are 9-1/2 feet long and 5-3/4 ounces  in weight. This rod will handle the bucktail spinners which I use for  trout and bass, when other things have failed. I used a rod of this  description for several summers both in Adirondack and western waters.  It had a hand-made reel seat, agate first guide, was satisfactory in  every respect, and I could see in balance, action, and appearance no  superiority in a rod costing $25.00, which one of my friends sported.  Charles Dudley Warner, who writes charmingly of woods life, has the  following in regard to trout fishing, which is so neatly humorous that  it will bear repeating:    \"It is well known that no person who regards his reputation will ever  kill a trout with anything but a fly. It requires some training on the  part of the trout to take to this method. The uncultivated trout in  unfrequented waters prefers the bait; and the rural people, whose sole  object in going a-fishing appears to be to catch fish, indulge them in  their primitive state for the worm. No sportsman, however, will use  anything but a fly--except he happens to be alone.\" Speaking of rods, he  says: \"The rod is a bamboo weighing seven ounces, which has to be  spliced with a winding of silk thread every time it is used. This is a  tedious process; but, by fastening the joints in this way, a uniform  spring is secured in the rod. No one devoted to high art would think of  using a socket joint.\"    One summer during a seven weeks' tour in the Northern Wilderness, my  only rod was a 7-1/2 foot Henshall. It came to hand with two bait-tips  only; but I added a fly-tip, and it made an excellent \"general fishing  rod.\" With it I could handle a large bass or pickerel; it was a capital  bait-rod for brook trout; as fly rod it has pleased me well enough. It  is likely to go with me again. For reel casting, the 5-1/2 foot rod is  handier. But it is not yet decided which is best, and I leave every man  his own opinion. Only, I think one rod enough, but have always had more.    And don't neglect to take what sailors call a \"ditty-bag.\" This may be  a little sack of chamois leather about 4 inches wide by 6 inches in  length. Mine is before me as I write. Emptying the contents, I find it  inventories as follows: A dozen hooks, running in size from small minnow  hooks to large Limericks; four lines of six yards each, varying from the  finest to a size sufficient for a ten-pound fish; three darning needles  and a few common sewing needles; a dozen buttons; sewing silk; thread,  and a small ball of strong yarn for darning socks; sticking salve; a bit  of shoemaker's wax; beeswax; sinkers, and a very fine file for  sharpening hooks. The ditty-bag weighs, with contents, 2-1/2 ounces; and  it goes in a small buckskin bullet pouch, which I wear almost as  constantly as my hat. The pouch has a sheath strongly sewed on the back  side of it, where the light hunting knife is always at hand, and it also  carries a two-ounce vial of fly medicine, a vial of \"pain killer,\" and  two or three gangs of hooks on brass wire snells--of which, more in  another place. I can always go down into that pouch for a water-proof  match safe, strings, compass, bits of linen and scarlet flannel (for  frogging), copper tacks, and other light duffle. It is about as handy a  piece of woods-kit as I carry.    I hope no aesthetic devotee of the fly-rod will lay down the book in  disgust when I confess to a weakness for frogging. I admit that it is  not high-toned sport; and yet I have got a good deal of amusement out of  it. The persistence with which a large batrachian will snap at a bit of  red flannel after being several times hooked on the same lure, and the  comical way in which he will scuttle off with a quick succession of  short jumps after each release; the cheerful manner in which, after each  bout, he will tune up his deep, bass pipe--ready for another greedy snap  at an ibis fly or red rag--is rather funny. And his hind legs, rolled in  meal and nicely browned, are preferable to trout or venison.          Chapter III         GETTING LOST--CAMPING OUT--ROUGHING IT OR SMOOTHING       IT--INSECTS--CAMPS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM      With a large majority of prospective tourists and outers, \"camping out\"  is a leading factor in the summer vacation. And during the long winter  months they are prone to collect in little knots and talk much of camps,  fishing, hunting, and \"roughing it.\" The last phrase is very popular and  always cropping out in the talks on matters pertaining to a vacation in  the woods. I dislike the phrase. We do not go to the green woods and  crystal waters to rough it, we go to smooth it. We get it rough enough  at home; in towns and cities; in shops, offices, stores, banks--anywhere  that we may be placed--with the necessity always present of being on  time and up to our work; of providing for the dependent ones; of keeping  up, catching up, or getting left. \"Alas for the life-long battle, whose  bravest slogan is bread.\"    As for the few fortunate ones who have no call to take a hand in any  strife or struggle, who not only have all the time there is, but a great  deal that they cannot dispose of with any satisfaction to themselves or  anybody else--I am not writing for them; but only to those of the  world's workers who go, or would like to go, every summer to the woods.  And to these I would say, don't rough it; make it as smooth, as restful  and pleasurable as you can.    To this end you need pleasant days and peaceful nights. You cannot  afford to be tormented and poisoned by insects, nor kept awake at night  by cold and damp, nor to exhaust your strength by hard tramps and heavy  loads. Take it easy, and always keep cool. Nine men out of ten, on  finding themselves lost in the woods, fly into a panic, and quarrel with  the compass. Never do that. The compass is always right, or nearly so.  It is not many years since an able-bodied man--sportsman of course--lost  his way in the North Woods, and took fright, as might be expected. He  was well armed and well found for a week in the woods. What ought to  have been only an interesting adventure, became a tragedy. He tore  through thickets and swamps in his senseless panic, until he dropped and  died through fright, hunger and exhaustion.    A well authenticated story is told of a guide in the Oswegatchie region,  who perished in the same way. Guides are not infallible; I have known  more than one to get lost. Wherefore, should you be tramping through a  pathless forest on a cloudy day, and should the sun suddenly break from  under a cloud in the northwest about noon, don't be scared. The last day  is not at hand, and the planets have not become mixed; only, you are  turned. You have gradually swung around, until you are facing northwest  when you meant to travel south. It has a muddling effect on the  mind--this getting lost in the woods. But, if you can collect and  arrange your gray brain matter, and suppress all panicky feeling, it is  easily got along with. For instance; it is morally certain that you  commenced swinging to southwest, then west, to northwest. Had you kept  on until you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34617"],[0,"The Jews of Barnow: Stories (#3)"],[1,"arise from their own errors, and the  faults of their surroundings. It would mean, however, nothing less than  the political degradation of that country in which Christian and Jew  live. Mr. Froude has been much blamed, little lauded, for what he wrote  in regard to an oppressed race. It was somewhat as follows: that those  who could not fight for their freedom did not deserve it.    It sometimes happens that fiction produces effects where facts fail. It  is believed, then, that Franzos's stories will not only be of interest  to numerous readers, but in the hands of the reformed Jew, by means of  the lessons it teaches, help him in his earnest efforts to save his race  from retrogression.    BARNET PHILLIPS.          PREFACE.      The following stories, the scene of which is laid in the Podolian  Ghetto, were my first literary attempt. They were for the most part  written while I was at the university, and were published in various  journals. Owing to circumstances, another and later book--\"Aus  Halb-Asien\"--was the first to come out; for this youthful work was not  published as a whole until 1876. I mention this, although it is visible  from internal evidence, to explain my choice of subjects. The preface to  that edition gives a further account of this, and from it I make the  following quotations:    \"When I took up my pen four years ago, I strongly felt the necessity of  making my work as artistic as possible. I wished to write stories, and  strove to give them poetic value. For this very reason, it seemed  necessary that I should describe the kind of life with which I was best  acquainted. This was essentially the case with regard to that of the  Podolian Jews. I therefore became the historian of the Podolian Ghetto,  and it was my great desire to give these stories an artistic form; but  not at the cost of truth. I have never permitted my love of the  beautiful to lead me into the sin of falsifying the facts and conditions  of life, and am confident that I have described this strange and  outlandish mode of existence precisely as it appeared to me. If in my  first published volume my efforts to portray men and manners needed the  assistance of my powers as a novelist, so in this book my knowledge of  men and manners has to help me in my labors as a novelist. Sometimes the  one side of my character takes the upper hand, and sometimes the other;  but still they are at bottom inseparable, and it has always been my  endeavor to describe facts artistically. However the novelist may be  judged, the portrayer of men and manners demands that his words should  be believed.    \"This request is not superfluous, for it is a very strange mode of life  to which I am about to introduce the reader. The influences and  counter-influences that affect it are only touched upon in this book.  Had I given a full account of them in an introduction, the introduction  would, in all likelihood have been longer than the book. I have  therefore refrained from doing it, and believe that I was right in  making this decision. For I have kept before my eyes, while penning  these stories, that I am writing for a Western reader. If he will only  trust to my love of truth, and regard the separate stories in  combination with each other, he will gain a clear idea of the kind of  life I describe without any further particulars. I would repeat one  sentence, the truth of which is shown in my first book: 'Every country  has the Jews that it deserves'--and it is not the fault of the Polish  Jews that they are less civilized than their brethren in the faith in  England, Germany, and France. At least, it is not entirely their fault.    \"No one can do more than his nature permits. This book is to a certain  extent polemical, and the stories are written with an object. I do not  deny that this is the case, and do not think it requires any excuse.  Still I have never allowed myself to sin against truth in the pursuit of  this object. I do not make the Polish Jews out to be either better or  worse than they really are. These stories are not written for the  purpose of holding up the Eastern Jews to obloquy or admiration, but  with the object of throwing as much light as I could in dark places.\"    The second edition, published in 1877, only differed from the first in a  few alterations made in the language; but the third edition (from which  this translation is taken) is not only enlarged, but is also changed in  several important particulars. I examined each story carefully, and  strove to bring all into a distinct connection with each other, thus  giving a clear idea of Polish Judaism regarded as a whole. For this  reason new tales were introduced: they describe Jewish customs that had  been at first passed over in silence, but which were necessary for the  proper appreciation of the subject.    This work has been translated into all European languages, as well as  into Hebrew; and now I have the pleasure of being able to lay it before  the English public, by whom I hope it will receive as kind a reception  as it has been given elsewhere. I hope so less for my own sake than in  the interest of the unfortunate people whose life it describes.    KARL EMIL FRANZOS.    VIENNA.          CONTENTS.      THE SHYLOCK OF BARNOW    CHANE    TWO SAVIOURS OF THE PEOPLE    \"THE CHILD OF ATONEMENT\"    ESTERKA REGINA    \"BARON SCHMULE\"    THE PICTURE OF CHRIST    NAMELESS GRAVES          THE SHYLOCK OF BARNOW.    (1873.)      The Jew's great white house stands exactly opposite the old gray  monastery of the Dominicans, and close to the public road that leads  from Lemberg to Skala, passing through the gloomy little town of Barnow  on the way. The people born in the small dirty houses of the Ghetto grow  up with a feeling of the deepest respect and admiration for this house  and its owner, old Moses Freudenthal. Both house and man are the pride  of Barnow; and both in their own way justify this pride.    To describe the house in the first place. It really seems to be  conscious of its own grandeur as it stands there proud and stately in  all the dignity of white-washed cleanliness, the long windows of the  first floor bright and shining, and the painted shutters of the  shop-windows coming down to the very ground at either side of the great  folding-doors which stand invitingly open. For it is a house of  entertainment, and the nobles of the country-side know how to take  advantage of its superior attractions when they come to town on  magisterial business, or attend the weekly market. It is also patronized  by the cavalry officers who are stationed in the villages in the  neighborhood, whenever the boredom of country quarters drives them into  town. Besides this, the house is let in suites of apartments, and the  greatest of the magnates of Barnow, such as the district judge and the  doctor, live there. But it would be difficult to give a list of all the  house contains, the ground-floor is so crowded. In one room is a lottery  agency, then come the offices of a company for insuring cattle, men, and  corn; and again, a drapery establishment, a grocer's shop, a room in  which gentlemen may drink their wine, and another where the poor man can  enjoy his glass of brandy-and-water. But then, the lottery agent, the  agent of the insurance company, the draper, the grocer, and the  innkeeper are one and all--Moses Freudenthal.    But the tall stern-looking old man to whom the house belongs is even  more worthy of notice than it and all it contains. His family has been  the grandest in the town as long as people can remember, and to him  belongs of right the chief place in the synagogue. His father had been  appointed head of the session on the death of his grandfather, and when  his father died he was chosen as his successor without a dissentient  voice, and by the unsolicited vote of the whole congregation. He is  regarded as one of the most pious and honorable men in the Jewish  community. Added to this is his wealth--his enormous wealth!    His co-religionists regard him as a millionaire, and they are right. For  he not only possesses the big white house and all that is in it, but he  has every reason to look upon several of the estates in the neighborhood  as more really belonging to him than to the Polish nobles who live on  them. And then Komorowka is his also. This beautiful place fell into his  hands when little Count Smolski and his lovely wife Aurora lost it by  their extravagance after a very few years' possession. Komorowka is  indeed a lovely place. No wonder that when the time came for Count  Smolski to leave his old home, he was in such utter despair that he  sought to forget his woes in the worst fit of drunkenness of his whole  life.    Would you be much surprised if you were now told that Moses Freudenthal  was not only the richest and proudest, but also the most envied, man in  Barnow?    But this he is not. Ask the poorest man in the Jewish town--the teacher  of the law, who, with his six children, often suffers from the pangs of  hunger, or the water-carriers, who groan under the heavy pails they bear  from morning to night from the town-well--ask these men whether they  would exchange lots with Moses, and they will at once answer, \"No.\" For  Freudenthal's sorrow is even greater than his wealth.    It is true that you can not read this in his face as he stands, tall and  stately, in the doorway of his house. His silver-gray hair falls down  below his black velvet skull-cap; the two long curls that hang, one at  each side of the face, as is the fashion of the Chassidim, are also  silver-gray and thin. But his figure is still strong and upright, and  the curiously cut Jewish coat that he wears, resembling a _talar_ in  shape, and made of black cloth, is by no means an unbecoming garment.  The old man stands almost motionless watching the painter who is busy  painting the doors of the spirit-shop a bright arsenic green, with  bottles, glasses,"]]]
