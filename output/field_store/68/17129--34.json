E  Tatshenshini River, 11/2mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 4.    _Remarks._--Specimens from extreme southwestern Yukon Territory appear  to be referable to this subspecies. The one adult female (skull only,  with body measurements) from the southwestern end of Dezadeash Lake  has a shorter skull than does any adult female of _T. h.  columbiensis_. No skins of adults are in the series, but the skins of  three subadults have darker upper parts, a darker tail and less  olivaceous sides than _T. h. columbiensis_.

The squirrel taken at Yerrick Creek was captured in a rat trap; Alcorn  found these animals to be \"fairly common\" in that area. He obtained no  evidence that the natives use them for food.

In pallor of coloration the specimens  taken on August 16 along the Richardson Highway, 32 miles south and 4  miles west of Big Delta, Alaska, show some resemblance to _C. p.  ablusus_, which occurs to the westward, although in other diagnostic  characters these specimens are typically _C. p. plesius_.    Specimens in early stages of molt were taken on July 3, 4, and 14;  another specimen in an advanced stage of molt was obtained on July 10.  One melanistic individual was taken one mile northeast of Whitehorse  on July 11.    Alcorn found these ground squirrels locally abundant, especially in  the vicinity of Whitehorse in Yukon Territory. A large population was  observed along the highway west of the Teslin River; animals were  seen for several miles along the road, principally in open coniferous  forests where there was little or no underbrush. Alcorn caught several  animals near the city dump at Whitehorse. Along the Richardson Highway  he observed these ground squirrels almost continuously for  approximately ten miles. He comments that the animals appeared to be  more numerous in the man-cleared areas along the highway than in  \"unmolested areas farther back from the highway.\" Specimens were taken  with collecting gun and in rat traps baited with \"chewed\" rolled oats.

Chipmunks in early stages of molt  with fresh pelage extending posteriorly to the middle of the dorsal  part of the back were taken on June 19, 20, and 22; others in fresh  pelage above, except for the hind quarters, were taken on June 15 and  on September 2.    Alcorn found this species nowhere abundant; for example, in 187 museum  special traps set near Charlie Lake, 5 miles west and 3 miles north of  Fort St. John, in British Columbia, he took only one chipmunk.

W Fort Nelson, 3.    _Remarks._--Some of the specimens taken between Summit Pass and Toad  River show evidence of intergradation between the paler and grayer _E.  m. caniceps_ and the brighter and browner _E. m. borealis_. Rand  (1944:41) also found evidence of intergradation between these two  subspecies in this area.    Along the highway, Alcorn found this species to be somewhat more  abundant in the Yukon Territory than in British Columbia. He often  found the animals occupying abandoned road camps; seemingly they were  more numerous in these areas than in undisturbed natural habitat.

(Type from Helm Bay, Cleveland    Peninsula, southeastern Alaska.)        _Glaucomys sabrinus zaphaeus_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 44:43,    June 13, 1918.    _Specimens examined._--One from _Yukon Territory_: 11/2 mi. S and 3  mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft.    _Remarks._--Although comparative material is not available at this  writing, descriptions in the literature indicate that this single  adult female belongs to the coastal form, _G. s. zaphaeus_. In both  color and in cranial and external measurements, this specimen appears  to agree closely with descriptions given by Howell (1918:43) and by  Cowan (1937:78 and 82), although its measurements are also in the  range of those given for _G. s. alpinus_ by Cowan (_loc. cit._). It  may be pointed out that Swarth (1936:402) regarded a specimen from 15  miles south of Atlin, British Columbia, as _G. s. alpinus_.    Measurements of Alcorn's specimen are as follows: total length, 331;  tail, 143; hind foot, 42; ear from notch, 23; greatest length of  skull, 41.7; zygomatic breadth, 25.7; mastoid breadth, 21.7; length of  nasals, 12.2; length maxillary tooth-row, 8.2; interorbital  constriction, 8.2; and postorbital constriction, 9.0.

NE Barkerville, British Columbia.)    _Specimens examined._--Two from _British Columbia_: Fort Halkett, N  side Liard River.    _Remarks._--Two beaver skulls obtained by Alcorn from trapper Johnny  Pie appear to be of this subspecies. Anderson (1947:133) records this  subspecies from the Liard River, in the area from which these  specimens were taken. The trapper told Alcorn that he shot these two  beavers in the winter of 1947-48 and hung the skulls in a tree.

The narrow end  of _B_ is fixed by an india-rubber cork to a strong bottle _D_ of two or  three litres capacity. The india-rubber cork also carries an exit tube  _E_, and _D_ is pierced near its bottom by a small hole at _F_.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    In using the apparatus _A_ is connected with the water-supply, and water  passing through _G_, carries air with it into _D_. The water escapes  from _D_ by the opening at _F_, and the air is allowed to pass out by  the tube _E_, its passage being regulated by a tap. Fresh supplies of  air enter _B_ by _C_.      =Blow-pipe Flames=--_The Pointed Flame._--If the gas tap of a Herapath  blow-pipe be adjusted so that comparatively little gas can pass, and if  the foot-blower be then worked cautiously, a long tongue of flame ending  in a fine point will be produced (Fig. 3). This flame will subsequently  be described as the _pointed flame_. It should be quite free from  luminosity, and as the amount of air necessary for securing a pointed  flame is large, in proportion to the gas, there is excess of oxygen  towards the end _C_. By adjusting the proportions of air and gas,  pointed flames of various dimensions can be obtained with the same  blow-pipe. The part of a pointed flame to be used in glass-working is  the tip, or in some cases the space slightly beyond the tip.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    _The Brush Flame._--If a large supply of gas be turned on and a  considerable blast of air sent into the flame, a non-luminous flame of  great size will be obtained (Fig. 4). In form it somewhat resembles a  large camel's hair pencil, and may conveniently be described as a  _brush flame_. The chief advantage of a large-sized blow-pipe is, that  with it a large brush flame may be produced, which is often invaluable.  By gradually diminishing the supply of gas and air smaller brush flames  may be produced.    The jet used to supply air to the Herapath blow-pipe is usually too  fine, and consequently does not permit the passage of sufficient air to  produce a brush flame that contains excess of oxygen, even with the aid  of a very powerful blower. My own Herapath blow-pipe only gives a  satisfactory oxidising brush flame when the jet is removed altogether  from the end of the air-tube. For producing pointed flames the finer jet  of the air-tube must be used, but when a highly oxidising flame of large  size is required it must be removed. The internal diameter of the  central air-tube should be nearly half as great as that of the outer or  gas-supply tube. Fletcher's Automaton with the large air jet gives a  very liberal supply of air, and produces an excellent oxidising brush  flame. In the case of the larger-sized Automaton a consequence of this  is, however, that when fitted with the large jet it will not give so  good a pointed flame as the Herapath, which, in its turn, gives an  inferior oxidising brush. By fitting finer jets to the air-tube of  Fletcher's apparatus pointed flames can be secured when necessary.    _The Smoky Flame._--By turning on a very free supply of gas, and only  enough air to give an outward direction to the burning gas, a smoky  flame, chiefly useful for annealing and for some simple operations on  lead glass, is produced.    The Gimmingham blow-pipe and Fletcher's combination blow-pipe, in  addition to the above flames, are also adapted to produce a non-luminous  flame, resembling that of the Bunsen gas-burner, which is very  convenient for the preliminary heating of the glass, and also for  gradually cooling finished apparatus. It is not necessary to describe  the method of using these last-mentioned blow-pipes. With the more  complicated of them directions for its use are supplied.    Mr. Madan has suggested the use of oxygen in place of air for producing  the oxidising flame required for working lead glass, and to produce a  flame of high temperature for softening tubes of hard, or combustion,  glass. For the latter purpose the employment of oxygen may be adopted  with great advantage. For working lead glass, however, it is quite  unnecessary if the directions already given are followed.    The student's subsequent success will so largely depend upon his  acquaintance with the resources of his blow-pipe, and on the facility  with which he can take advantage of them, that no pains should be spared  in the effort to become expert in its management as soon as possible. A  few experiments should now be made, therefore, upon the adjustment of  the flame, until the student is able to produce and modify any form of  flame with promptness and certainty.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    The remaining apparatus used in glass-working consists of triangular and  other files, charcoal pastils for cutting glass, pieces of sound  charcoal of various diameters with conical ends; it is convenient to  have one end somewhat less pointed than the other (Fig. 5). Corks of  various sizes; the smallest, which are most frequently needed, should be  carefully cut with sharpened cork borers from larger corks. Besides  these there should be provided some freshly distilled turpentine in  which camphor has been dissolved,[1] fine and coarse emery powder, and  some sheets of cotton-wadding, an india-rubber blowing-bottle, glass  tubes, a little white enamel, and a pair of iron tongs.    [1] Half an ounce of camphor to about six ounces of turpentine will do  very well.          CHAPTER II.    _VARIETIES OF GLASS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT._      All the varieties of glass that are ordinarily met with contain silica  (SiO_{2}) associated with metallic oxides. In a true glass there are at  least two metallic oxides. The unmixed silicates are not suitable for  the purposes of glass. They are not so capable of developing the viscous  condition when heated as mixtures--some of them are easily attacked by  water, and many of those which are insoluble are comparatively  infusible. There is generally excess of silica in glass, that is, more  than is necessary to form normal silicates of the metals present. The  best proportions of the various constituents have been ascertained by  glass-makers, after long experience; but the relation of these  proportions to each other, from a chemical point of view, is not easy to  make out.    The varieties of glass from which tubes for chemical glass-blowing are  made may be placed under three heads, and are known as[2]--      Soft soda glass.   Also known as French glass.    Lead glass.        Also known as English glass.    Hard glass.    [2] For details of the composition of the various glasses, some work on  glass-making may be consulted.    In purchasing glass tubes, it is well to lay in a considerable stock of  tubes made of each of the two first varieties, and, if possible, to  obtain them from the manufacturer, for it frequently happens that pieces  of glass from the same batch may be much more readily welded together  than pieces of slightly different composition. Yet it is not well to lay  in too large a stock, as sometimes it is found that glass deteriorates  by prolonged keeping.    As it is frequently necessary to make additions, alterations, or repairs  to purchased apparatus, it is best to provide supplies both of soft soda  glass and lead glass, for though purchased glass apparatus is frequently  made of lead glass, yet sometimes it is formed from the soda glass, and  as it is a matter of some difficulty to effect a permanent union between  soda glass and lead glass, it is desirable to be provided with tubes of  both kinds.    Many amateurs find that soda glass is in some respects easier to work  with than lead glass. But, on the other hand, it is somewhat more apt to  crack during cooling, which causes much loss of time and disappointment.  Also, perhaps in consequence of its lower conductivity for heat, it very  often breaks under sudden changes of temperature during work. If,  however, a supply of good soda glass is obtained, and the directions  given in this book in regard to annealing it are thoroughly carried out,  these objections to the use of soda glass will, to a great extent, be  removed. I find, however, that when every precaution has been taken,  apparatus made of soda glass will bear variations of temperature less  well than that made of lead glass. Therefore, although the comparatively  inexpensive soda glass may be employed for most purposes without  distrust, yet I should advise those who propose to confine themselves to  one kind of glass, to take the small extra trouble required in learning  to work lead glass.    In order to secure glass of good quality, a few pieces should be  obtained as a sample, and examined by the directions given below. When  the larger supply arrives, a number of pieces, taken at random, should  be examined before the blow-pipe, to compare their behaviour with that  of the sample pieces, and each piece should be separately examined in  all other respects as described subsequently.    Hard glass is used for apparatus that is required to withstand great  heat. It is difficult to soften, especially in large pieces. It should  only be employed, therefore, when the low melting points of soda or lead  glass would render them unsuitable for the purpose to which the finished  apparatus is to be put. What is sold as Jena combustion tube should be  preferred when this is the case.      =Characters of good Glass.=--Glass tubes for glass-blowing should be as  free as possible from knots, air-bubbles, and stripes. They should be in  straight pieces of uniform thickness, and cylindrical bore. It is not  possible to obtain glass tubes of absolutely the same diameter from one  end to the other in large quantities, but the variations should not be  considerable.    When a sharp transverse scratch is made with a good file on a piece of  tube, and the"]]]
