It had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and  pack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him  lodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an  exception of this trip.    At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,  yellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the  ground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine-needles, level as a  floor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his  near approach--tiny, brown, light-striped squirrels, and larger ones,  russet-colored, and the splendid dark-grays with their white bushy tails  and plumed ears.    This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,  almost like a prairie, with foot-hills lifting near and far, and the  red-gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale  flushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their  subdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,  showed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began  to run pell-mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared  bobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of  skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as  they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the  hindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and  the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine-needles thrown up into  his face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt  into a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the  forest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory  beasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf  and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the  gentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he  loved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.    He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent  where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun-lighted  glades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,  and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,  silent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass  a dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his  direction, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.  Old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale  shot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over  the ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched  their heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the  height of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.    Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon  he came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a  league-long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening  desert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon  line.    The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered  forest. A road, running parallel with a dark-watered, swift-flowing  stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue  smoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow  in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted  with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site  appeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut  timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,  tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and  happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.    Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden  bordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray  and bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.    \"Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!\" she exclaimed, in welcome.    \"Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,\" he replied. \"An' I've brought you a  turkey.\"    \"Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass.... What  a gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home  gobblers like that.... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.\"    Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had  never returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave  up hope.    \"Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,\" replied Dale, as  he had said to her many a time.    \"Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat  a fresh egg or a flapjack?\"    \"You should remember,\" he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a  small, clean kitchen.    \"Laws-a'-me! An' thet's months ago,\" she replied, shaking her gray head.  \"Milt, you should give up that wild life--an' marry--an' have a home.\"    \"You always tell me that.\"    \"Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet.... Now you set there, an' pretty soon  I'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.\"    \"What's the news, Auntie?\" he asked.    \"Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two  weeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul--she's better off--an' one of  my cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.  An' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's  heifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss--you know his  favorite--was stole by hoss-thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds  me, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?\"    \"My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from  horse-thieves.\"    \"Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,  an' no mistake.\"    Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting  all that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale  enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good  to sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been  such butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple  pie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of  Dale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.    \"How's old Al Auchincloss?\" presently inquired Dale.    \"Poorly--poorly,\" sighed Mrs. Cass. \"But he tramps an' rides around  same as ever. Al's not long for this world.... An', Milt, that reminds  me--there's the biggest news you ever heard.\"    \"You don't say so!\" exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.    \"Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to  inherit all his property. We've heard much of her--a purty lass, they  say.... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go  to work.... You can marry that girl!\"    \"No chance for me, Auntie,\" replied Dale, smiling.    The old woman snorted. \"Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt  Dale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.\"    \"Me!... An' why, Auntie?\" he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When  he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the  ideas of people.    \"Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of  ten--an' then sometimes as old as the hills.... There's no young man to  compare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl--she'll have all the spunk  of the Auchinclosses.\"    \"Then maybe she'd not be such a catch, after all,\" replied Dale.    \"Wal, you've no cause to love them, that's sure. But, Milt, the  Auchincloss women are always good wives.\"    \"Dear Auntie, you're dreamin',\" said Dale, soberly. \"I want no wife. I'm  happy in the woods.\"    \"Air you goin' to live like an Injun all your days, Milt Dale?\" she  queried, sharply.    \"I hope so.\"    \"You ought to be ashamed. But some lass will change you, boy, an' mebbe  it'll be this Helen Rayner. I hope an' pray so to thet.\"    \"Auntie, supposin' she did change me. She'd never change old Al. He  hates me, you know.\"    \"Wal, I ain't so sure, Milt. I met Al the other day. He inquired for  you, an' said you was wild, but he reckoned men like you was good for  pioneer settlements. Lord knows the good turns you've done this village!  Milt, old Al doesn't approve of your wild life, but he never had no hard  feelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep.\"    \"Auntie, I don't believe Tom ever killed Al's sheep,\" declared Dale,  positively.    \"Wal, Al thinks so, an' many other people,\" replied Mrs. Cass, shaking  her gray head doubtfully. \"You never swore he didn't. An' there was them  two sheep-herders who did swear they seen him.\"    \"They only saw a cougar. An' they were so scared they ran.\"    \"Who wouldn't? Thet big beast is enough to scare any one. For land's  sakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the time  you did. All the folks an' children an' hosses in Pine broke an' run  thet day.\"    \"Yes; but Tom wasn't to blame. Auntie, he's the tamest of my pets.  Didn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand?\"    \"Wal, Milt, I ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a  lot of people I know. Fer he did. But the looks of him an' what's been  said was enough for me.\"    \"An' what's all that, Auntie?\"    \"They say he's wild when out of your sight. An' thet he'd trail an' kill  anythin' you put him after.\"    \"I trained him to be just that way.\"    \"Wal, leave Tom to home up in the woods--when you visit us.\"    Dale finished his hearty meal, and listened awhile longer to the old  woman's talk; then, taking his rifle and the other turkey, he bade her  good-by. She followed him out.    \"Now, Milt, you'll come soon again, won't you--jest to see Al's  niece--who'll be here in a week?\"    \"I reckon I'll drop in some day.... Auntie,"]]]
