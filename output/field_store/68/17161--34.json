THE LIVING BUTTERFLY OR MOTH          _Materials._    Individual specimens in large jars or cages, and other specimens in  cages with foliage; simple lenses and a needle or pin.          _Observations._    Butterflies may generally be distinguished from moths by their habit  of holding their wings together above them when at rest, by the  feelers which are knobbed at the end, and by the rather slender  abdomen. Moths generally either fold their wings or hold them  outstretched, their feelers are not knobbed, and their bodies are  rather bulky.    Observe these points in your specimen and the colors of the upper and  under sides of the wings. Find the large eyes and examine them with a  lens. With the needle or pin carefully uncoil the sucking tube which  you may find under the head between two shields. Note the fuzziness  of the body and the \"dust\" which covers the wings. Examine some of  this dust under a lens.          _Questions._    1. Is your specimen a butterfly or a moth? Prove your statement. If  possible, give the name of your specimen.    2. Write a description of your specimen--its size, general color, and  special color pattern.    3. Describe the sucking tube, or \"proboscis,\" and name some flowers  from which it might obtain nectar. Try to find out how the tube is  operated.    4. Why is it that moths and butterflies never bite? Do they sting?  How do you think they protect themselves from enemies?    5. State how the fuzz and dust on your specimen might influence a  bird's liking for it.    6. Contrast the size and usefulness of the wings of the butterfly  with those of some other insect you know about; contrast their legs;  state how development of one set of structures may cause another set  to be simple or feeble.    7. Most moths are active by night. What explanation can you give for  their large eyes and expanded feelers? Feelers of insects may be for  any or all of the following: touch, taste, smell, and hearing.          _Suggested drawings._    a. The butterfly or moth.    b. An antenna (feeler).      THE LIVING CATERPILLAR          _Materials._    Living caterpillars in cages or covered jars for individual study,  and other specimens in cages with foliage for food or concealment.          _Observations._    The pupil should observe the general form and external construction  of the caterpillar, watching it feeding, in action, and at rest.    Notice how the creature moves. Find its head, its segments (similar  divisions of the body), and its breathing holes along the sides of  the body. Try to find its eyes, any feelers, wings or paddles. Try to  loosen it from its support; find the tiny hooks on the feet for  clinging fast.          _Questions._    1. Give the general color of your specimen and explain how this color  may make it conspicuous or may aid its concealment.    2. Describe the outer surface or covering of the caterpillar. What  structures, if any, are there, which might make the animal  distasteful or inedible?    3. How many pairs of legs are there? How are they distributed along  the body? Counting the segments, state which ones bear no legs.    4. To what extent do the legs act in locomotion? Are they mere organs  for attachment while the body swings forward and backward, or do the  legs do this, as in a horse? Make a complete statement.    5. Notice the openings of the internal breathing tubes. How are they  protected against dust and other foreign matter?    6. Does the caterpillar seem to be a warm-blooded animal? State how  the free access of air along the body would influence internal  temperature.    7. What do you know about a caterpillar's appetite? How might  caterpillars be beneficial or harmful? What means has nature of  holding their numbers in check?    8. Recalling that caterpillars finally \"sleep\" for several days or  weeks and awaken as winged creatures, how can you account for their  appetites?      THE TUSSOCK MOTH          _Materials._    Directions for the study of the caterpillar stage will be found in  the exercise \"The Living Caterpillar,\" and directions for the study  of the adult male form will be found in the exercise \"The Living  Butterfly or Moth.\" The female tussock moth is a wingless,  thick-bodied creature, gray in color, very downy, and about three  fourths of an inch long. The following directions apply more  particularly to the study of the cocoons and the general harmfulness  of the tussock moth.    This exercise may be done best outside of the classroom, the pupil  answering the questions on scrap paper and rewriting these notes in  the laboratory. Living caterpillars, cocoons, some of them bearing  their frothy masses of wax and eggs, pupae, and adult moths of both  sexes may be used in the laboratory.          _Observations and Questions._    1. On what kinds of trees are the cocoons and the caterpillars  generally found? What effect have the caterpillars on the trees, and  what may possibly be the final effect upon the trees of the locality  or the entire district?    2. Upon what part of the tree are the cocoons made, and why? Where on  the bark are they, and why?    3. Is the opening of the cocoon at the upper or the lower end? What  reason can you assign for this?    4. Count the number of cocoons upon the entire tree or estimate it by  counting those upon a part of the tree. Now count the number of eggs  on a cocoon. Assuming that one half of the cocoons bear eggs,  calculate the number of caterpillars on a tree next year.    5. How is the waxy covering of the eggs a particularly good  protection against winter weather?    6. Investigate the interiors of several cocoons and state what you  find.    7. On the pupa find the jointed and tapering hinder end, abdomen, and  at the head region and lying along the under side, the marks of the  legs and the feelers, and possibly the wings, all pressed close  against the body. Find also the breathing pores along the sides of  the abdomen.    8. Unlikeness between male and female is called \"sexual dimorphism.\"  Explain how the tussock moth shows this. For what work does each form  seem particularly adapted?    9. What methods would you use that the tussock moth might be  destroyed or kept out of a community?      The numerous small worm-like creatures often found are the    caterpillar stages of another insect, an ichneumon fly, which    laid its eggs under the skin of the tussock caterpillar. How has    their development affected that of the tussock moth? What great    result does nature accomplish by this arrangement?          _Suggested drawings._    a. A caterpillar, x 2.    b. A cocoon with its egg mass.    c. A pupa as seen from the under side.    d. An adult moth, either male or female.      THE LIVING BEETLE          _Materials._    Living beetles in cages, together with portions of the plant upon  which they are found; or if water beetles are used, they should be  kept in aquaria. Individual specimens in battery jars or wide-mouth  bottles, and preserved beetles in pans or vials for reference.          _Observations._    1. Upon what plant or in what surroundings is your kind of beetle  generally found? If you can, give its common name.    2. What is the length, breadth, and thickness of your beetle? Would  you describe it as a \"small\" insect or a \"large\" one?    3. Of what general color is it? Describe any color markings you see.    4. If any of the legs differ from the others or are of peculiar  shape or length, describe them and tell what you think they may be  fitted to do.    5. As a rule, beetles have harder \"shells\" than other insects. Does  this shell completely inclose the body, or can you find any soft  parts exposed? How are the head, thorax, and abdomen joined so as to  carry out the apparent purpose of protection? What is the outline of  the body--a continuous line or one with many irregularities?    6. If possible, try to lift up one side of the \"shell\" from the  hinder end of the body. You will discover that this portion of the  shell is a pair of hard sheath wings, and beneath them is another  pair. How are the under ones unlike the upper in size and texture? in  use? in arrangement when not in use?    7. Does a beetle spend most of its life on the wing, like bees and  flies? How might the body covering and the structure of the outer  wings affect or determine the beetle's habits, even against its will?    8. Are the feelers or are the eyes of your specimen more easily  distinguished? Upon which of the special senses does it seem to place  most dependence?    9. Is your kind of beetle good for anything, either in nature or in  human affairs? Make a statement regarding what good or what harm it  may do.      THE DAMSEL FLY LARVA          _Materials._    Living larvae of the damsel fly in shallow watch glasses of water for  individual use, and others in large pans or aquaria. Simple lenses or  dissecting microscopes.          _Observations._    1. What is the color and the shape of the larva? how long is it?  Notice in what surroundings in the water the larva lives, and answer  to yourself how its form and color would protect it in those  surroundings.    2. Since the larva is an insect, though immature, its body is  composed of three regions: head, thorax, and abdomen. How do these  regions differ from each other?    3. What structures has your specimen to enable it to move from place  to place? If fully developed wings are not present, what indication  is there of their being formed?    4. What sense organs has the larva? Which ones seem to be the largest  and most useful?    5. Although the aquatic larva is preparing for adult life in the air,  there should be some arrangement for securing air in the water. Where  do you find outgrowths of the skin which might increase the  air-absorbing surface? How many of these structures are there? Look  within them for the air tubes,--fine branching black lines.    6.

An initial dose, and several supplemental doses  of phencyclidine and promazine were administered intramuscularly and  intraperitoneally between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. CDT. The wolves were  restrained with muzzles and their legs were bound together during  processing and transport. Two of the wolves were blindfolded because  they were too active otherwise.    The wolves were ear-tagged with both Minnesota and Michigan Department  of Natural Resources tags, and weights and body measurements were taken  (Fig. 6, 7). Their teeth were inspected and canines were measured to try  to obtain an indication of age. Each animal was fitted with a radio  transmitter (AVM Instrument Co., Champaign, Illinois[11]) molded into an  acrylic collar (Mech, 1974).    [Illustration: _Fig. 7.--Standard body measurements were also taken  (USFWS Photo by Don Reilly)_]    Each wolf was injected with 1,200,000 units of Bicillin (Wyeth), 2 cc of  distemper-hepatitus-leptospirosis vaccine (BioCeutic Laboratories D-Vac  HL), 0.5 cc of vitamins A, D, E, (Hoffman-LaRoche[11] Injacom 100), 1 cc  of vitamin C-fortified vitamin B complex (Eli-Lilly, Betalin Complex  FC), and 2 cc anti rabies vaccine (Fromms Raboid). These injections  (Fig. 8) were given to insure that the wolves would be as healthy as  possible upon release, and would not contract or introduce diseases in  the release area.    [11] _Mention of trade names does not constitute endorsement by the U.  S. Government._    Some 30 to 60 cc of blood were drawn from each wolf for analysis of its  physical condition (Seal et al. 1975).    The processing of the wolves took from 8:45 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. CDT on  March 5, 1974. The animals were then transported by truck to  International Falls, loaded on an airplane (Fig. 9), and flown for 2  hours (Fig. 10) to the Marquette County Airport, Michigan. They were  turned on different sides each half hour while drugged during their  processing and transport to prevent lung congestion. At the Marquette  Airport they were transferred by van to a 25 foot by 25 foot by 12 foot  (7.6 m x 7.6 m x 3.7 m) holding pen on the Huron Mountain Club property  35 miles (56.3 km) northwest of Marquette.    [Illustration: _Fig. 8.--Various vitamins and vaccines were administered  to each wolf to insure their health and freedom from common canine  diseases (USFWS Photo by Don Reilly)_]    The wolves were released individually into the holding pen while each  was still partly under sedation (Fig. 11). The transmitting frequency of  each wolf's collar was rechecked on the receiver as each wolf was  released into the pen (Fig. 12). All wolves were in the pen by 10:00  p.m. EDT, and were held there until March 12.    Four road-killed deer carcasses, provided by the Michigan Department of  Natural Resources, had been placed inside the pen for food (Fig. 13),  and a tub of drinking water was provided. Carcasses of five road-killed  deer and a black bear (_Ursus americanus_) were placed within a  half-mile (0.8 km) of the release pen as food for the wolves after their  release.    We had scheduled the release for mid-March for several reasons which we  felt would maximize chances for success. Deer are concentrated then in  the Huron Mountain area and vulnerable to predation. Pregnancy and  subsequent whelping of the alpha female might increase her attachment to  the new area. Furthermore, the snow is usually deepest then and hinders  travel. However, a few days before the release, a freak rainstorm had  settled the snow, and cold temperatures had frozen it so hard that  animals could walk readily on top, making travel conditions excellent.    [Illustration: _Fig. 9.--The anesthetized wolves were placed aboard an  aircraft in International Falls, Minnesota (USFWS Photo by Don Reilly)_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 10.--The wolves were kept lightly drugged during  the flight to Michigan (USFWS Photo by L. David Mech)_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 11.--In the Huron Mountain area of Upper Michigan  the wolves were taken to another holding pen (Photo by Don Pavloski)_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 12.--Biologists checked the signal from each  radio-collar before the wolves were released into the holding pen (Photo  by Don Pavloski)_]    An observation shack 120 feet (36.6 m) from the pen was used to  determine the activities and interactions of the four wolves. Weise  spent three nights in the shack and also observed the wolves each day of  the one-week penned period, for a total of 20 hours of observation (Fig.  14).    During preliminary air and ground checks of radio equipment, we  discovered that Wolf No. 10 had a defective collar. Thus on March 12, we  subdued her with a choker, restrained her with ropes, replaced her  collar and released her just after sunset. We then opened the pen, and  let the other wolves loose.    [Illustration: _Fig. 13.--While in captivity, the wolves were fed  primarily on road-killed deer (Photo by Don Pavloski)_]    The subsequent locations of the wolves were then checked intermittently  through aerial radio-tracking (Mech 1974), with a receiver and antenna  from the AVM Instrument Co., Champaign, Illinois, used in a Cessna 172  and a Piper Colt. We made two flights each day for the first 2 days  after release, one each day when weather permitted, until April 20,  three per week in May, approximately two per week from June through  September, and three per week in October and November. A total of 194  hours were flown, 80 per cent by Weise, and the remainder by Hook.  Aerial locations were usually recorded to the nearest 40 acres (16 ha.).    We also tracked the wolves from the ground whenever interesting or  significant activities were observed during flights or were reported by  ground observers. Carcasses of prey animals were investigated from the  ground after consumption was complete and the wolves had left. Deer  eaten by the wolves were considered killed by them if the ground check  revealed fresh blood or flesh, or signs of a struggle. Scats were  collected along the tracks of the wolves in the snow whenever possible.    When radio signals were received from the same location for unusually  long periods, ground checks were made to determine the cause.    Attempts were made to verify all sightings and track records reported by  local citizens, by comparing them with the aerially-determined  locations.                                          RESULTS                   Social Structure of the Translocated Wolves      Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13 were captured in Minnesota within a mile (1.6  km) of each other, and No. 11 and 12 were taken in the same trap set 12  days apart; Wolf No. 10 was caught approximately 7.5 miles (12.1 km)  southeast of the others (Table 2). All were judged to be thin but in  good condition.    Females No. 10 and 11 were introduced into the same pen on January 23.  No. 11 was reluctant to enter the pen containing No. 10 while several  observers were around, but entered within 15 minutes after all but one  had left. No. 11 went directly to No. 10 which was lying in a corner as  she usually did, and pawed the fence at No. 10's back. When the pawing  became more vigorous, No. 10 snapped at No. 11, moving only her head and  neck. No. 11 then turned directly to No. 10, sniffed the top of her head  and mane, and lay down beside No. 10 with her nose still in No. 10's  mane. No. 10 remained still throughout the whole process. The trapper  reported that later No. 11 licked the face of No. 10. Sniffing and  licking anteriorally are usually signs of intimacy between wolves  (Schenkel 1947).    The two male wolves (No. 12 and No. 13) were allowed into the pen with  the two females on February 4. No. 13 remained in the original adjoining  pen and did not move in with the females immediately, but No. 12 did.  There were no signs of aggression among any of the four wolves. No. 11,  12, and 13 moved freely around the pen while in Minnesota, but No. 10  most often lay in one corner by herself.    Trapper Himes first observed vaginal bleeding in female 11 on February  7. He observed Wolves 11 and 12 mating (with normal coupling) on  February 12 and 16.    No unusual "]]]
