We are told, for example, that often mercury and occasionally  sand were used to replace the water, which frequently froze in winter in  spite of the application of lighted braziers to the interior of the  machines. Then again, the astronomical models and the jackwork were  themselves subject to gradual improvement: at the time of I-Hsing, for  example, special attention was paid to the demarcation of ecliptic as  well as the normal equatorial coordinates; this was clearly an influx  from Hellenistic-Islamic astronomy, in which the relatively  sophisticated planetary mathematics had forced this change not otherwise  noted in China.    By the time of the Jesuits, this current of Chinese horology, long since  utterly destroyed by the perils of wars, storms, and governmental  reforms, had quite been forgotten. Matteo Ricci's clocks, those gifts  that aroused so much more interest than European theological teachings,  were obviously something quite new to the 16th-century Chinese scholars;  so much so that they were dubbed with a quite new name, \"self-sounding  bells,\" a direct translation of the word \"clock\" (_glokke_). In view of  the fact that the medieval Chinese escapement may have been the basis of  European horology, it is a curious twist of fate that the high regard of  the Chinese for European clocks should have prompted them to open their  doors, previously so carefully and for so long kept closed against the  foreign barbarians.    [Illustration: Figure 4.--ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK TOWER OF SU SUNG in  K'ai-feng, _ca._ A.D. 1090, from an original drawing by John  Christiansen. (_Courtesy of Cambridge University Press._)]          Mechanized Astronomical Models    Now that we have seen the manner in which mechanized astronomical models  developed in China, we can detect a similar line running from  Hellenistic time, through India and Islam to the medieval Europe that  inherited their learning. There are many differences, notably because of  the especial development of that peculiar characteristic of the West,  mathematical astronomy, conditioned by the almost accidental conflux of  Babylonian arithmetical methods with those of Greek geometry. However,  the lines are surprisingly similar, with the exception only of the  crucial invention of the escapement, a feature which seems to be  replaced by the influx of ideas connected with perpetual motion wheels.      HELLENISTIC PERIOD    Most interesting and frequently cited is the bronze planetarium said to  have been made by Archimedes and described in a tantalisingly  fragmentary fashion by Cicero and by later authors. Because of its  importance as a prototype, we give the most relevant passages in  full.[11]    Cicero's descriptions of Archimedes' planetarium are (italics supplied):      Gaius Sulpicius Gallus ... at a time when ... he happened    to be at the house of Marcus Marcellus, his colleague in    the consulship [166 B.C.], ordered the celestial globe to    be brought out which the grandfather of Marcellus had    carried off from Syracuse, when that very rich and    beautiful city was taken [212 B.C.].... Though I had heard    this globe (sphaerae) mentioned quite frequently on    account of the fame of Archimedes, when I saw it I did not    particularly admire it; for that other celestial globe,    also constructed by Archimedes, which the same Marcellus    placed in the temple of Virtue, is more beautiful as well    as more widely known among the people. But when Gallus    began to give a very learned explanation of the device, I    concluded that the famous Sicilian had been endowed with    greater genius than one would imagine possible for human    being to possess. For Gallus told us that the other kind    of celestial globe, which was solid and contained no    hollow space, was a very early invention, the first one of    that kind having been constructed by Thales of Miletus,    and later marked by Eudoxus of Cnidus--a disciple of    Plato, it was claimed--with constellations and stars which    are fixed in the sky. He also said that many years later    Aratus ... had described it in verse.... But this newer    kind of globe, he said, on which were delineated the    motions of the sun and moon and of those five stars which    are called wanderers, or, as we might say, rovers    [_i. e._, the five planets], contained more than could be    shown on the solid globe, and the invention of Archimedes    deserved special admiration because he had thought out a    way to represent accurately by a single device for turning    the globe, those various and divergent movements with    their different rates of speed. And when Gallus moved    [_i.e._, set in motion] the globe, it was actually true    that the moon was always as many revolutions behind the    sun on the _bronze_ contrivance as would agree with the    number of days it was behind in the sky. Thus the same    eclipse of the sun happened on the globe as would actually    happen, and the moon came to the point where the shadow of    the earth was at the very time when the sun (appeared?)    out of the region ... [several pages are missing in the    manuscript; there is only one].        _De republica_, I, xiv (21-22), Keyes' translation.      When Archimedes put together in a globe the movements of    the moon, sun and five wandering [planets], he brought    about the same effect as that which the god of Plato did    in the Timaeus when he made the world, so that one    revolution produced dissimilar movements of delay and    acceleration.        _Tusculanae disputationes_, I, 63.    Later descriptions from Ovid, Lactantius, Claudian, Sextus Empiricus,  and Pappus, respectively, are (italics supplied):      There stands a globe suspended by a Syracusan's skill in    an enclosed bronze [frame, or sphere--or perhaps, in    enclosed air], a small image of the immense vault [of    heaven]; and the earth is equally distant from the top and    bottom; that is brought about by its [_i. e._, the outer    bronze globe's] round form. The form of the temple [of    Vesta] is similar....        Ovid, _Fasti_ (1st century, A.D.), VI, 277-280,        Frazer's translation.      The Sicilian Archimedes, was able to make a reproduction    and model of the world in concave _brass_ (concavo aere    similitudinem mundi ac figuram); in it he so arranged the    _sun_ and _moon_ and resembling the celestial revolutions    (caelestibus similes conversionibus); and while it    revolved it exhibited not only the accession and recession    of the sun and the waxing and waning of the moon    (incrementa deminutionesque lunae), but also the unequal    _courses of the stars_, whether fixed or wandering.        Lactantius, _Institutiones divinae_ (4th century, A.D.),        II, 5, 18.      Archimedes' sphere. When Jove looked down and saw the    heavens figured in a sphere of _glass_, he laughed and    said to the other gods: \"Has the power of mortal effort    gone so far? Is my handiwork now mimicked in a fragile    globe?\" An old man of Syracuse had imitated on earth the    laws of the heavens, the order of nature, and the    ordinances of the gods. Some hidden influence within the    sphere directs the various courses of the _stars_ and    actuates the lifelike mass with definite motions. A false    _zodiac_ runs through a year of its own and a toy _moon_    waxes and wanes month by month. Now bold invention    rejoices to make its own heaven revolve and sets the    _stars_ [planets?] in motion by human wit....        Claudian, _Carmina minora_ (_ca._ A.D. 400), LI (LXVIII),        Platnaure's translation.      The things that move by themselves are more wonderful than    those which do not. At any rate, when we behold an    Archimedean sphere in which the sun and the rest of the    stars move, we are immensely impressed by it, not by Zeus    because we are amazed at the _wood_, or at the movements    of these [bodies], but by the devices and causes of the    movements.        Sextus Empiricus, _Adversus mathematicos_ (3rd century,        A.D.), IX, 115, Epps' translation.      Mechanics understand the making of spheres and know how to    produce a model of the heavens (with the courses of the    stars moving in circles?) by mean of equal and circular    motions of _water_, and Archimedes the Syracusan,    according to some, knows the cause and reasons for all of    these.      Pappus (3rd century, A.D.), _Works_ (Hultsch edition),      VIII, 2, Epps' translation.      A similar arrangement seems to be indicated in another mechanized globe,  also mentioned by Cicero and said to have been made by Posidonius:      But if anyone brought to Scythia or Britain the globe    (sphaeram) which our friend Posidonius [of Apameia, the    Stoic philosopher] recently made, in which each revolution    produced the same (movements) of the _sun_ and _moon_ and    _five_ wandering stars as is produced in the sky each day    and night, who would doubt that it was by exertion of    reason?... Yet doubters ... think that Archimedes showed    more knowledge in producing movements by revolutions of a    globe than nature (does) in effecting them though the copy    is so infinitely inferior to the original....       _De natura deorum_, II, xxxiv-xxxv (88),      Yonge's translation.    In spite of the lack of sufficient technical details in any case, these  mechanized globe models, with or without geared planetary indicators  (which would make them highly complex machines), bear a striking  resemblance to the earliest Chinese device described by Chang Heng. One  must not reject the possibility that transmission from Greece or Rome  could have reached the East by the beginning of the 2nd century, A.D.,  when he was working. It is an interesting question, but even if such  contact actually occurred, very soon afterwards, as we shall see, the  western and eastern lines of evolution parted company and evolved so far  as can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#3)"],[1," to kill a man as to have you for his attorney.\"    As Keeper of the Great Seal Thurlow had the alternate presentation to a  living with the Bishop of ----. The Bishop's secretary called upon the  Lord Chancellor and said, \"My Lord Bishop of ---- sends his compliments  to your lordship, and believes that the next turn to present to ----  belongs to his lordship.\"--\"Give his lordship my compliments,\" replied  the Chancellor, \"and tell him that I will see him d--d first before he  shall present.\"--\"This, my lord,\" retorted the secretary, \"is a very  unpleasant message to deliver to a bishop.\" To which the Chancellor  replied, \"You are right, it is so; therefore tell the Bishop that _I  will be_ d--d first before he shall present.\"    Lord Campbell in his life of Thurlow says that in his youth the  Chancellor was credited with wild excesses. There was a story, believed  at the time, of some early amour with the daughter of a Dean of  Canterbury, to which the Duchess of Kingston alluded when on her trial  at the House of Lords. Looking Thurlow, then Attorney-General, full in  the face she said, \"That learned gentleman dwelt much on my faults, but  I too, if I chose, could tell a Canterbury tale.\"    But with all his bitterness and sarcasm Lord Thurlow had a genuine  sense of humour, as the following story of his Cambridge days  illustrates--days when he was credited with more disorderly pranks and  impudent escapades than attention to study. \"Sir,\" observed a tutor, \"I  never come to the window but I see you idling in the Court.\"--\"Sir,\"  replied the future Lord Chancellor, \"I never come into the Court but I  see you idling at the window.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: WILLIAM MURRAY, EARL OF MANSFIELD, LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.]    Mansfield was not credited with lively sensibility, but his humanity was  shocked at the thought of killing a man for a trifling theft. Trying a  prisoner at the Old Baily on the charge of stealing in a dwelling-house  to the value of 40_s._--when this was a capital offence--he advised the  jury to find a gold trinket, the subject of the indictment, to be of  less value. The prosecutor exclaimed with indignation, \"Under 40_s._, my  lord! Why, the _fashion_ alone cost me more than double the sum.\"--\"God  forbid, gentlemen, we should hang a man for fashion's sake,\" observed  Lord Mansfield to the jury.    An indictment was tried before him at the Assizes, preferred by parish  officers for keeping an hospital for lying-in women, whereby the parish  was burdened by illegitimate children. He expressed doubts whether this  was an indictable offence, and after hearing arguments in support of it  he thus gave his judgment. \"We sit here under a Commission requiring us  to _deliver_ this gaol, and the statute has been cited to make it  unlawful to _deliver_ a woman who is with child. Let the indictment be  quashed.\"    Having met at supper the famous Dr. Brocklesby, he entered into familiar  conversation with him, and there was an interchange of stories just a  little trenching on the decorous. It so happened that the doctor had to  appear next morning before Lord Mansfield in the witness-box; and on the  strength of the previous evening's doings the witness, on taking up his  position, nodded to the Chief Justice with offensive familiarity as to a  boon companion. His lordship taking no notice of his salutation, but  writing down his evidence, when he came to summing it up to the jury  thus proceeded: \"The next witness is one Rocklesby or Brocklesby,  Brocklesby or Rocklesby--I am not sure which--and first he swears he is  a physician.\"    Lord Chief Baron Parker, in his eighty-seventh year, having observed to  Lord Mansfield who was seventy-eight: \"Your lordship and myself are now  at sevens and eights,\" the younger Chief Justice replied: \"Would you  have us to be all our lives at sixes and sevens? But let us talk of  young ladies and not old age.\"    Trying an action which arose from the collision of two ships at sea, a  sailor who gave an account of the accident said, \"At the time I was  standing abaft the binnacle.\"--\"Where is abaft the binnacle?\" asked  Lord Mansfield; upon which the witness, who had taken a large share of  grog before coming into Court, exclaimed loud enough to be heard by all  present: \"A pretty fellow to be a judge, who don't know where abaft the  binnacle is!\" Lord Mansfield, instead of threatening to commit him for  contempt, said: \"Well, my friend, fit me for my office by telling me  where _abaft the binnacle is_; you have already shown me the meaning of  _half-seas over_.\"    On one occasion Lord Mansfield covered his retreat from an untenable  position with a sparkling pleasantry. An old witness named ELM having  given his evidence with remarkable clearness, although he was more than  eighty years of age, Lord Mansfield examined him as to his habitual mode  of living, and found he had been through life an early riser and a  singularly temperate man. \"Ay,\" remarked the Chief Justice, in a tone of  approval, \"I have always found that without temperance and early habits  longevity is never attained.\" The next witness, the elder brother of  this model of temperance, was then called, and he almost surpassed his  brother as an intelligent and clear-headed utterer of evidence. \"I  suppose,\" observed Lord Mansfield, \"that you are an early riser?\"--\"No,  my lord,\" answered the veteran stoutly; \"I like my bed at all hours, and  special-_lie_ I like it of a morning.\"--\"Ah, but like your brother, you  are a very temperate man?\" quickly asked the judge, looking out  anxiously for the safety of the more important part of his theory. \"My  lord,\" responded this ancient Elm, disdaining to plead guilty to a  charge of habitual sobriety, \"I am a very old man, and my memory is as  clear as a bell, but I can't remember the night when I've gone to bed  without being more or less drunk.\"--\"Ah, my lord,\" Mr. Dunning  exclaimed, \"this old man's case supports a theory unheld by many  persons--that habitual intemperance is favourable to longevity.\"--\"No,  no,\" replied the Chief Justice with a smile; \"this old man and his  brother merely teach us what every carpenter knows--that Elm, whether it  be wet or dry, is a very tough wood.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: JOHN SCOTT, EARL OF ELDON, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    Lord Eldon's good humour gained him the affection of all counsel who  practised before him, but there is one story--apocryphal it may be,  coming from Lord Campbell--of a prejudice he had against Lord Brougham,  who, in Scottish cases, frequently appeared before him in the House of  Lords. Lord Eldon persisted in addressing the advocate as Mr. Bruffam.  This was too much for Brougham, who was rather proud of the form and  antiquity of his name, and who at last, in exasperation, sent a note to  the Chancellor, intimating that his name was pronounced \"Broom.\" At the  conclusion of the argument the Chancellor stated, \"Every authority upon  the question has been brought before us: new Brooms sweep clean.\"    As Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon's great foible was an apparent inability  to arrive at an early decision on any question: it was really a desire  to weigh carefully all sides of a question before expressing his  opinion. This hesitancy was expressed in the formula \"I doubt,\" which  became the subject of frequent jests among the members of the Bar.    Sir George Rose, in absence of the regular reporter of Lord Eldon's  decisions, was requested to take a note of any decision which should be  given. As a full record of all that was material, which had occurred  during the day, Sir George made the following entry in the reporter's  notebook:        \"Mr. Leach made a speech,      Angry, neat, but wrong;      Mr. Hart, on the other part,      Was heavy, dull, and long;      Mr. Parker made the case darker,      Which was dark enough without;      Mr. Cooke cited his book;      And the Chancellor said--I doubt.\"    This _jeu d'esprit_, flying about Westminster Hall, reached the  Chancellor, who was very much amused with it, notwithstanding the  allusion to his doubting propensity. Soon after, Sir George Rose having  to argue before him a very untenable proposition, he gave his opinion  very gravely, and with infinite grace and felicity thus concluded: \"For  these reasons the judgment must be against your clients; and here, Sir  George, the Chancellor does not _doubt_.\"    The following was Lord Eldon's answer to an application for a piece of  preferment from his old friend Dr. Fisher, of the Charter House:    \"DEAR FISHER,--I cannot, to-day, give you the preferment for which you  ask.--I remain, your sincere friend, ELDON.\" Then, on the other side, \"I  gave it to you yesterday.\"    According to his biographer, Lord Eldon caused a loud laugh while the  old Duke of Norfolk was fast asleep in the House of Lords, and amusing  their lordships with \"that tuneful nightingale, his nose,\" by announcing  from the woolsack, with solemn emphasis, that the Commons had sent up a  bill for \"enclosing and dividing Great Snoring in the county of  Norfolk!\"    Like Lord Thurlow, Lord Eldon was in close intimacy with George III in  the days when his Majesty's mind was supposed to be not very strong. \"I  took down to Kew,\" relates his lordship, \"some Bills for his assent, and  I placed on a paper the titles and the effect of them. The king, being  perhaps suspicious that my coming down might be to judge of his  competence for public business, as I was reading over the titles of the  different Acts of Parliament he interrupted me and said: 'You are not  acting correctly, you should do one of two things; either bring me down  the Acts for my perusal, or say, as Thurlow once said to me on a like  occasion, having read several he stopped and said, \"It is all d--d  nonsense trying to make you understand them, and you had better consent  to them at once.\"'\"      "]]]
