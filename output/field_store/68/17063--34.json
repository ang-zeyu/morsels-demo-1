She was fond of luxury, and we were always sure to find her  curled up in the newest arm-chair or on the piece of stuff that best set  off her swan's-down coat. She spent endless time at her toilet; every  morning she carefully smoothed out her fur. She used her paws to wash  herself, and every single hair of her fur, having been brushed out with  her rosy tongue, shone like brand-new silver. If any one touched her,  she at once removed the traces of the touch, for she could not bear to  be rumpled. Her elegance and stylishness suggested that she was an  aristocrat, and among her own kind she must have been a duchess at the  very least. She delighted in perfumes, stuck her little nose into  bouquets, and bit with little spasms of pleasure at handkerchiefs on  which scent had been put; she walked upon the dressing-table among the  scent-bottles, smelling the stoppers, and if she had been allowed to do  so would no doubt have used powder. Such was Seraphita, and never did a  cat bear a poetic name more worthily.    At about this time a couple of those sham sailors who sell striped rugs,  handkerchiefs of pine-apple fibre and other exotic products, happened to  pass through the Rue de Longchamps, where I was living. They had in a  little cage a pair of white Norway rats with red eyes, as pretty as  pretty could be. Just then I had a fancy for white creatures, and my  hen-run was inhabited by white fowls only. I bought the two rats, and a  big cage was built for them, with inner stairs leading to the different  stories, eating-places, bedrooms, and trapezes for gymnastics. They were  unquestionably happier and better off there than La Fontaine's rat in  his Dutch cheese.    The gentle creatures, which, I really do not know why, inspire puerile  repulsion, became astonishingly tame as soon as they found out that no  harm was intended them. They allowed themselves to be petted just like  cats, and would catch my finger in their ideally delicate little rosy  hands, and lick it in the friendliest way. They used to be let out at  the end of our meals, and would clamber up the arms, the shoulders, and  the heads of the guests, emerging from the sleeves of coats and  dressing-gowns with marvellous skill and agility. All these  performances, carried out very prettily, were intended to secure  permission to forage among the remains of the dessert. They were then  placed on the table, and in a twinkling the male and female had put away  the nuts, filberts, raisins, and lumps of sugar. It was most amusing to  watch their quick, eager ways, and their astonishment when they reached  the edge of the table. Then, however, we would hold out to them a strip  of wood reaching to their cage, and they stored away their gains in  their pantry.    The pair multiplied rapidly, and numerous families, as white as their  progenitors, ran up and down the little ladders in the cage, so that ere  long I found myself the owner of some thirty rats so very tame that when  the weather was cold they were in the habit of nestling in my pockets in  order to keep warm, and remained there perfectly still. Sometimes I used  to have the doors of my City of Rats thrown open, and, after having  ascended to the topmost story of my house, I whistled in a way very  familiar to my pets. Then the rats, which find it difficult to ascend  steps, climbed up the balusters, got on to the rail, and proceeding in  Indian file while keeping their equilibrium like acrobats, ascended that  narrow road not infrequently descended astride by schoolboys, and came  to me uttering little squeaks and manifesting the liveliest joy. And  now I must confess to a piece of stupidity on my part. I had so often  been told that a rat's tail looked like a red worm and spoiled the  creature's pretty looks, that I selected one of the younger generation  and cut off the much criticised caudal appendage with a red-hot shovel.  The little rat bore the operation very well, grew apace, and became an  imposing fellow with mustaches. But though he was the lighter for the  loss of his tail, he was much less agile than his comrades; he was very  careful about trying gymnastics and fell very often. He always brought  up the rear when the company ascended the balusters, and looked like a  tight-rope dancer trying to do without a balancing-pole. Then I  understood the usefulness of a tail in the case of rats: it aids them to  maintain their equilibrium when scampering along cornices and narrow  ledges. They swing it to the right or the left by way of counterpoise  when they lean over to the one side or the other; hence the constant  switching which appears so causeless. When one observes Nature  carefully, one readily comes to the conclusion that she does nothing  that is unnecessary, and that one ought to be very careful in attempting  to improve upon her.    No doubt my reader wonders how cats and rats, two races so hostile to  each other, and the one of which is the prey of the other, can manage to  live together. The fact is that mine got on wonderfully harmoniously  together. The cats were good as gold to the rats, which had lost all  fear of them. The felines were never perfidious, and the rats never had  to mourn the loss of a single comrade. Don Pierrot of Navarre was  uncommonly fond of them; he would lie down by their cage and spend hours  watching them at play. When by chance the door of the room was closed,  he would scratch and miaoul gently until it was opened and he could join  his little white friends, which often came and slept by him. Seraphita,  who was more stand-off and who disliked the strong odour of musk given  out by the rats, did not take part in their sports, but she never harmed  them, and allowed them to pass quietly in front of her without ever  unsheathing her claws.    The end of these rats was strange. One heavy, stormy summer's day, when  the mercury was nearly up to a hundred degrees, their cage had been put  in the garden, in an arbour covered with creepers, as they seemed to  feel the heat greatly. The storm burst with lightnings, rain, thunder,  and squalls of wind. The tall poplars on the river bank bent like reeds.  Armed with an umbrella, which the wind turned inside out, I was just  starting to fetch in my rats, when a dazzling flash of lightning, which  seemed to tear open the very depths of heaven, stopped me on the  uppermost of the steps leading from the terrace to the garden.    A terrific thunder-clap, louder than the report of a hundred guns,  followed almost instantaneously upon the flash, and the shock was so  violent that I was nearly thrown to the ground.    The storm passed away shortly after that frightful explosion, but, on  reaching the arbour, I found the thirty-two rats, toes up, killed by the  one and same stroke of lightning. No doubt the iron wires of their cage  had attracted the electric fluid and acted as a conductor.    Thus died together, as they had lived, the thirty-two Norway rats,--an  enviable death, not often vouchsafed by fate!          III    THE BLACK DYNASTY      Don Pierrot of Navarre, being a native of Havana, required a hot-house  temperature, and he enjoyed it in the house; round the dwelling,  however, stretched great gardens, separated by open fences through which  a cat could easily make its way, and rose great trees in which  twittered, warbled, and sang whole flocks of birds; so that sometimes  Pierrot, profiting by a door left open, would go out at night and start  on a hunt, rambling through the grass and flowers wet with dew. In such  cases he would have to await daylight to be let in, for although he  would come and miaoul under our windows, his appeals did not always  awaken the sleepers in the house. He had a delicate chest, and one  night, when it was colder than usual, he caught a cold which soon turned  into consumption. After coughing for a whole year poor Pierrot became  thin and emaciated, and his coat, formerly so silky, had the mat  whiteness of a shroud. His great transparent eyes had become the most  important feature in his poor shrunken face; his red nose had turned  pale, and he walked with slow steps, in a melancholy fashion, by the  sunny side of the wall, watching the yellow autumn leaves whirling and  twisting. One could have sworn he was reciting to himself Millevoye's  elegy. A sick animal is a very touching object, for it bears suffering  with such gentle and sad resignation. We did all we could to save him; I  called in a very skilful physician who tested his chest and felt his  pulse. Ass's milk was prescribed, and the poor little creature drank it  willingly enough out of his tiny china saucer. He would remain for hours  at a time stretched out on my knee like the shadow of a sphinx; I could  feel his vertebrae like the grains of a chaplet, and he would try to  acknowledge my caresses with a feeble purr that sounded like a  death-rattle. On the day he died, he lay on his side gasping, but got  himself up by a supreme effort, came to me, and opening wide his eyes,  fixed upon me a glance that called for help with intense supplication.  He seemed to say to me, \"You are a man; do save me.\" Then he staggered,  his eyes already glazed, and fell to the ground, uttering so woeful, so  despairing, so anguished a cry that it filled me with mute horror. He  was buried at the foot of the garden, under a white rosebush that still  marks the place of his tomb.    Seraphita died two or three years later, of croup, which the physician  was unable to master. She rests not far from Pierrot.    With her ended the White Dynasty, but not the family. From that pair of  snow-white cats had sprung three coal-black kittens, a mystery the  solution of which I leave to others. Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\" were  then all the rage, and the names of the characters in the novel were in  every one's mouth. The two little male cats were called Enjolras and  Gavroche, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#3)"],[1,"in the Methodical  Encyclopaedia; and I had more reasons than one to decline entering upon a  work in which he is employed.    It will, no doubt, be a matter of surprise, that in a treatise upon the  elements of chemistry, there should be no chapter on the constituent and  elementary parts of matter; but I shall take occasion, in this place, to  remark, that the fondness for reducing all the bodies in nature to three  or four elements, proceeds from a prejudice which has descended to us  from the Greek Philosophers. The notion of four elements, which, by the  variety of their proportions, compose all the known substances in  nature, is a mere hypothesis, assumed long before the first principles  of experimental philosophy or of chemistry had any existence. In those  days, without possessing facts, they framed systems; while we, who have  collected facts, seem determined to reject them, when they do not agree  with our prejudices. The authority of these fathers of human philosophy  still carry great weight, and there is reason to fear that it will even  bear hard upon generations yet to come.    It is very remarkable, that, notwithstanding of the number of  philosophical chemists who have supported the doctrine of the four  elements, there is not one who has not been led by the evidence of facts  to admit a greater number of elements into their theory. The first  chemists that wrote after the revival of letters, considered sulphur and  salt as elementary substances entering into the composition of a great  number of substances; hence, instead of four, they admitted the  existence of six elements. Beccher assumes the existence of three kinds  of earth, from the combination of which, in different proportions, he  supposed all the varieties of metallic substances to be produced. Stahl  gave a new modification to this system; and succeeding chemists have  taken the liberty to make or to imagine changes and additions of a  similar nature. All these chemists were carried along by the influence  of the genius of the age in which they lived, which contented itself  with assertions without proofs; or, at least, often admitted as proofs  the slighted degrees of probability, unsupported by that strictly  rigorous analysis required by modern philosophy.    All that can be said upon the number and nature of elements is, in my  opinion, confined to discussions entirely of a metaphysical nature. The  subject only furnishes us with indefinite problems, which may be solved  in a thousand different ways, not one of which, in all probability, is  consistent with nature. I shall therefore only add upon this subject,  that if, by the term _elements_, we mean to express those simple and  indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable  we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term _elements_,  or _principles of bodies_, to express our idea of the last point which  analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all the  substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by  decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances  we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater  number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated,  or rather since we have not hitherto discovered the means of separating  them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought  never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has  proved them to be so.    The foregoing reflections upon the progress of chemical ideas naturally  apply to the words by which these ideas are to be expressed. Guided by  the work which, in the year 1787, Messrs de Morveau, Berthollet, de  Fourcroy, and I composed upon the Nomenclature of Chemistry, I have  endeavoured, as much as possible, to denominate simple bodies by simple  terms, and I was naturally led to name these first. It will be  recollected, that we were obliged to retain that name of any substance  by which it had been long known in the world, and that in two cases only  we took the liberty of making alterations; first, in the case of those  which were but newly discovered, and had not yet obtained names, or at  least which had been known but for a short time, and the names of which  had not yet received the sanction of the public; and, secondly, when the  names which had been adopted, whether by the ancients or the moderns,  appeared to us to express evidently false ideas, when they confounded  the substances, to which they were applied, with others possessed of  different, or perhaps opposite qualities. We made no scruple, in this  case, of substituting other names in their room, and the greatest number  of these were borrowed from the Greek language. We endeavoured to frame  them in such a manner as to express the most general and the most  characteristic quality of the substances; and this was attended with the  additional advantage both of assisting the memory of beginners, who find  it difficult to remember a new word which has no meaning, and of  accustoming them early to admit no word without connecting with it some  determinate idea.    To those bodies which are formed by the union of several simple  substances we gave new names, compounded in such a manner as the nature  of the substances directed; but, as the number of double combinations is  already very considerable, the only method by which we could avoid  confusion, was to divide them into classes. In the natural order of  ideas, the name of the class or genus is that which expresses a quality  common to a great number of individuals: The name of the species, on the  contrary, expresses a quality peculiar to certain individuals only.    These distinctions are not, as some may imagine, merely metaphysical,  but are established by Nature. \"A child,\" says the Abbe de Condillac,  \"is taught to give the name _tree_ to the first one which is pointed out  to him. The next one he sees presents the same idea, and he gives it the  same name. This he does likewise to a third and a fourth, till at last  the word _tree_, which he first applied to an individual, comes to be  employed by him as the name of a class or a genus, an abstract idea,  which comprehends all trees in general. But, when he learns that all  trees serve not the same purpose, that they do not all produce the same  kind of fruit, he will soon learn to distinguish them by specific and  particular names.\" This is the logic of all the sciences, and is  naturally applied to chemistry.    The acids, for example, are compounded of two substances, of the order  of those which we consider as simple; the one constitutes acidity, and  is common to all acids, and, from this substance, the name of the class  or the genus ought to be taken; the other is peculiar to each acid, and  distinguishes it from the rest, and from this substance is to be taken  the name of the species. But, in the greatest number of acids, the two  constituent elements, the acidifying principle, and that which it  acidifies, may exist in different proportions, constituting all the  possible points of equilibrium or of saturation. This is the case in the  sulphuric and the sulphurous acids; and these two states of the same  acid we have marked by varying the termination of the specific name.    Metallic substances which have been exposed to the joint action of the  air and of fire, lose their metallic lustre, increase in weight, and  assume an earthy appearance. In this state, like the acids, they are  compounded of a principle which is common to all, and one which is  peculiar to each. In the same way, therefore, we have thought proper to  class them under a generic name, derived from the common principle; for  which purpose, we adopted the term _oxyd_; and we distinguish them from  each other by the particular name of the metal to which each belongs.    Combustible substances, which in acids and metallic oxyds are a specific  and particular principle, are capable of becoming, in their turn, common  principles of a great number of substances. The sulphurous combinations  have been long the only known ones in this kind. Now, however, we know,  from the experiments of Messrs Vandermonde, Monge, and Berthollet, that  charcoal may be combined with iron, and perhaps with several other  metals; and that, from this combination, according to the proportions,  may be produced steel, plumbago, &c. We know likewise, from the  experiments of M. Pelletier, that phosphorus may be combined with a  great number of metallic substances. These different combinations we  have classed under generic names taken from the common substance, with a  termination which marks this analogy, specifying them by another name  taken from that substance which is proper to each.    The nomenclature of bodies compounded of three simple substances was  attended with still greater difficulty, not only on account of their  number, but, particularly, because we cannot express the nature of their  constituent principles without employing more compound names. In the  bodies which form this class, such as the neutral salts, for instance,  we had to consider, 1st, The acidifying principle, which is common to  them all; 2d, The acidifiable principle which constitutes their peculiar  acid; 3d, The saline, earthy, or metallic basis, which determines the  particular species of salt. Here we derived the name of each class of  salts from the name of the acidifiable principle common to all the  individuals of that class; and distinguished each species by the name of  the saline, earthy, or metallic basis, which is peculiar to it.    A salt, though compounded of the same three principles, may,  nevertheless, by the mere difference of their proportion, be in three  different states. The nomenclature we have adopted would have been  defective, had it not expressed these different states; and this we  attained chiefly by"]]]
