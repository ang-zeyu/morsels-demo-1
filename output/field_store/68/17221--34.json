Feet usually stout, with the  outer toe united to the middle one as far as, or beyond, the first  joint. They feed principally on berries and other soft fruits,  occasionally also on insects.      29. AMPELIS (Waxwing). Bill as above; nostrils oval, concealed by      small feathers directed forwards; wings long and pointed; first and      second primaries longest, some of the secondaries and tertials      terminating in wax-like prolongations of their shafts.        _Page 76_        FAMILY MUSCICAPIDA     (FLYCATCHERS)    Bill broad, flattened horizontally (depressed), slightly toothed and  adapted for catching small flying insects; nostrils more or less  covered by bristly hairs; feet generally feeble.      30. MUSCACAPA (Flycatcher). Bill moderate, somewhat triangular,      depressed at the base, compressed towards the tip, which is slightly      curved downwards; gape armed with stiff bristles; tarsus equal to or      longer than the middle toe; side toes of equal length; wings with      the first primary very short, and the third and fourth longest.                                                                    _Page 77_        FAMILY HIRUNDINIDA     (SWALLOWS AND MARTINS)    Beak short but broad, and more or less flattened horizontally; mouth  very deeply cleft; feet small and weak; wings with nine visible  primaries, long and powerful, and thus adapted for sustaining a  protracted flight in pursuit of winged insects, which form the sole  sustenance of these birds; tail long and usually forked; plumage  close, smooth, often burnished with a metallic gloss. Migratory birds,  spending the summer in temperate climates, but being impatient of  cold, withdrawing in winter to equatorial regions.      31. HIRUNDO (Swallow). Bill short, depressed, very wide at base,      commissure straight. Nostrils basal, oval, partly closed by      membrane. Tail deeply forked, of twelve feathers, the outermost      greatly elongated and abruptly attenuated. Legs and feet slender and      bare; toes rather long, three in front, one behind; claws moderate.                                                                    _Page 80_      32. CHELADON (Martin). Bill short, depressed, very wide at base,      commissure slightly decurved. Nostrils basal, oval, partly closed by      membrane and opening laterally. Tail forked, of twelve feathers,      outermost not abruptly attenuated. Legs and feet slender, closely      feathered above; toes rather long, three in front, one behind; claws      moderate, sharp.                                              _Page 83_      33. CA\"TILE (Sand-martin). Bill short, depressed, very wide at base,      commissure straight. Nostrils, wings and tail as in Chelidon. Legs      and feet slender, and bare except for tuft of feathers on tarsus      just above hallux; toes moderate, three in front, one behind; claws      strong.                                                       _Page 84_        FAMILY FRINGILLIDA     (FINCHES)    Remarkable for the shortness, thickness, and powerful structure of the  bill; the upper and lower mandibles are usually equally thick, and  their height and breadth are nearly alike, so that the bill when  closed presents the appearance of a short cone, divided in the middle  by the gape. By its aid they break open the hard woody capsules and  fruit-stones containing the seeds and kernels which form their chief  food. At nesting-time many species live on insect larvA|, with which  the young are almost exclusively fed. The wings have nine visible  primaries. This family is one of immense extent, consisting of  relatively small birds.      34. LIGURINUS (Greenfinch). Bill compressed towards tip, with scarcely      perceptible notch at point; nostrils basal, concealed by stiff      feathers directed forwards; wings rather pointed, first quill      obsolete, second, third and fourth nearly equal and longest.

Bill tapering rapidly to point, culmen      rounded; mandibles nearly equal, edges inflected and slightly      indented. Nostrils basal, lateral, oval, nearly hidden by projecting      and recurved frontal plumes. Wings with first quill obsolete, third      and fourth primaries nearly equal, sixth, seventh, and eighth curved      outwards. Tail short, and nearly square. Tarsus scutellate in front,      covered at sides with single plate, stout and short; claws      moderately curved, rather short and strong.                   _Page 87_      36. CARDUASLIS (Goldfinch and Siskin). Bill a rather elongated cone,      compressed at the tip, and finely pointed; wings long, pointed;      first three primaries nearly equal and the longest; tail slightly      forked.                                                       _Page 88_      37. PASSER (Sparrows). Bill somewhat arched above; lower mandible      rather smaller than the upper; first three primaries longest.                                                                    _Page 92_      38. FRINGILLA (Chaffinch and Brambling). Bill straight, sharp,      pointed; mandibles nearly equal; first primary a little shorter than      the second, much shorter than the third and fourth, which are nearly      equal and the longest.                                        _Page 95_      39. ACANTHIS (Linnet, Redpolls, Twite). Bill a short straight cone,      compressed at the tip; wings long, pointed; third primary somewhat      shorter than the first and second, which are equal and the longest;      tail forked.                                                  _Page 98_      40. PARRHULA (Bullfinch). Bill short and thick, the sides tumid; upper      mandible much arched and bending over the lower one; first primary      nearly equal to the fifth, second a little shorter than the third      and fourth, which are the longest.                           _Page 101_      41. LOXIA (Crossbill). Bill thick at the base; both mandibles equally      curved, hooked at the tips, and crossing each other at the points.                                                                   _Page 103_      42.

Tail rather long and slightly forked.      Claws considerably curved, that of hind toe of moderate length.                                                                   _Page 106_      43. PLECTROPHENAX (Snow Bunting). Bill with upper mandible narrower      than lower, otherwise as in Emberiza. Wings long and pointed, first      primary obsolete, second and third nearly equal and longest in wing,      fourth considerably longer than fifth. Tail moderate and slightly      forked. Front claws rather long and curved; hind claw considerably      curved and elongated.                                        _Page 110_      44. CALCARIUS (Lapland Bunting). Bill with considerably inflected      cutting edges (tomia); claws of front toes short and slightly      curved; hind claw nearly straight and elongated; other characters      much as in Plectrophenax.                                    _Page 111_        FAMILY MOTACILLIDA     (WAGTAILS AND PIPITS)    Wings with nine visible primaries.

ANTHUS (Pipit). Bill and nostrils very much as in Motacilla; two      of the scapulars as long as the closed wing; first primary acuminate      and nearly obsolete, second shorter than the third and fourth, which      are the longest; hind claw very long.                        _Page 116_        FAMILY ALAUDIDA     (LARKS)    Wings with nine or more visible primaries. Planta tarsi scutellate.  Granivorous birds, frequenting open spaces, and singing during their  flight; nesting on ground and seeking their food there by running;  they are 'pulverators', i. e. they shake dust or sand into their  feathers instead of bathing.      47. ALAUDA (Lark). Bill moderate, slightly compressed at edges; upper      mandible more or less arched from middle. Nostrils basal, oval,      covered by bristly feathers directed forward. Gape straight. Wings      long; first primary short but unmistakably developed; second, third      and fourth nearly equal, but third longest. Tail moderate, slightly      forked. Tarsus longer than middle toe; claws slightly curved and      moderate, except that of hind toe, which is generally elongate and      nearly straight.                                             _Page 119_      48.

Scarcely had the anchor been dropped, when, as if by magic, our vessel  was surrounded by a fleet of small boats and \"dug-outs\" manned by  crowds of shouting and gesticulating natives. After a short fight  between some rival Swahili boatmen for my baggage and person, I found  myself being vigorously rowed to the foot of the landing steps by the  bahareen (sailors) who had been successful in the encounter. Now, my  object in coming out to East Africa at this time was to take up a  position to which I had been appointed by the Foreign Office on the  construction staff of the Uganda Railway. As soon as I landed,  therefore, I enquired from one of the Customs officials where the  headquarters of the railway were to be found, and was told that they  were at a place called Kilindini, some three miles away, on the other  side of the island. The best way to get there, I was further informed,  was by gharri, which I found to be a small trolley, having two seats  placed back to back under a little canopy and running on narrow rails  which are laid through the principal street of the town. Accordingly, I  secured one of these vehicles, which are pushed by two strapping  Swahili boys, and was soon flying down the track, which once outside  the town lay for the most part through dense groves of mango, baobab,  banana and palm trees, with here and there brilliantly coloured  creepers hanging in luxuriant festoons from the branches.    On arrival at Kilindini, I made my way to the railway Offices and was  informed that I should be stationed inland and should receive further  instructions in the course of a day or two. Meanwhile I pitched my tent  under some shady palms near the gharri line, and busied myself in  exploring the island and in procuring the stores and the outfit  necessary for a lengthy sojourn up-country. The town of Mombasa itself  naturally occupied most of my attention. It is supposed to have been  founded about A.D. 1000, but the discovery of ancient Egyptian idols,  and of coins of the early Persian and Chinese dynasties, goes to show  that it must at different ages have been settled by people of the very  earliest civilisations. Coming to more modern times, it was held on and  off from 1505 to 1729 by the Portuguese, a permanent memorial of whose  occupation remains in the shape of the grim old fortress, built about  1593--on the site, it is believed, of a still older stronghold. These  enterprising sea-rovers piously named it \"Jesus Fort,\" and an  inscription recording this is still to be seen over the main entrance.  The Portuguese occupation of Mombasa was, however, not without its  vicissitudes. From March 15, 1696, for example, the town was besieged  for thirty-three consecutive months by a large fleet of Arab dhows,  which completely surrounded the island. In spite of plague, treachery  and famine, the little garrison held out valiantly in Jesus Fort, to  which they had been forced to retire, until December 12, 1698, when the  Arabs made a last determined attack and captured the citadel, putting  the remnant of the defenders, both men and women, to the sword. It is  pathetic to read that only two days later a large Portuguese fleet  appeared off the harbour, bringing the long-looked-for reinforcements.  After this the Portuguese made several attempts to reconquer Mombasa,  but were unsuccessful until 1728, when the town was stormed and  captured by General Sampayo. The Arabs, however, returned the next year  in overwhelming numbers, and again drove the Portuguese out; and  although the latter made one more attempt in 1769 to regain their  supremacy, they did not succeed.    The Arabs, as represented by the Sultan of Zanzibar, remain in nominal  possession of Mombasa to the present day; but in 1887 Seyid Bargash,  the then Sultan of Zanzibar, gave for an annual rental a concession of  his mainland territories to the British East Africa Association, which  in 1888 was formed into the Imperial British East Africa Company. In  1895 the Foreign Office took over control of the Company's possessions,  and a Protectorate was proclaimed; and ten years later the  administration of the country was transferred to the Colonial Office.    The last serious fighting on the island took place so recently as  1895-6, when a Swahili chief named M'baruk bin Rashed, who had three  times previously risen in rebellion against the Sultan of Zanzibar,  attempted to defy the British and to throw off their yoke. He was  defeated on several occasions, however, and was finally forced to flee  southwards into German territory. Altogether, Mombasa has in the past  well deserved its native name of Kisiwa M'vitaa, or \"Isle of War\"; but  under the settled rule now obtaining, it is rapidly becoming a thriving  and prosperous town, and as the port of entry for Uganda, it does a  large forwarding trade with the interior and has several excellent  stores where almost anything, from a needle to an anchor, may readily  be obtained.    Kilindini is, as I have said, on the opposite side of the island, and  as its name--\"the place of deep waters\"--implies, has a much finer  harbour than that possessed by Mombasa. The channel between the island  and the mainland is here capable of giving commodious and safe  anchorage to the very largest vessels, and as the jetty is directly  connected with the Uganda Railway, Kilindini has now really become the  principal port, being always used by the liners and heavier vessels.    I had spent nearly a week in Mombasa, and was becoming very anxious to  get my marching orders, when one morning I was delighted to receive an  official letter instructing me to proceed to Tsavo, about one hundred  and thirty-two miles from the coast, and to take charge of the  construction of the section of the line at that place, which had just  then been reached by railhead. I accordingly started at daylight next  morning in a special train with Mr. Anderson, the Superintendent of  Works, and Dr. McCulloch, the principal Medical Officer; and as the  country was in every way new to me, I found the journey a most  interesting one.    The island of Mombasa is separated from the mainland by the Strait of  Macupa, and the railway crosses this by a bridge about three-quarters  of a mile long, called the Salisbury Bridge, in honour of the great  Minister for Foreign Affairs under whose direction the Uganda Railway  scheme was undertaken. For twenty miles after reaching the mainland,  our train wound steadily upwards through beautifully wooded, park-like  country, and on looking back out of the carriage windows we could every  now and again obtain lovely views of Mombasa and Kilindini, while  beyond these the Indian Ocean sparkled in the glorious sunshine as far  as the eye could see. The summit of the Rabai Hills having been  reached, we entered on the expanse of the Taru Desert, a wilderness  covered with poor scrub and stunted trees, and carpeted in the dry  season with a layer of fine red dust. This dust is of a most  penetrating character, and finds its way into everything in the  carriage as the train passes along. From here onward game is more or  less plentiful, but the animals are very difficult to see owing to the  thick undergrowth in which they hide themselves. We managed, however,  to catch sight of a few from the carriage windows, and also noticed  some of the natives, the Wa Nyika, or \"children of the wilderness.\"    At Maungu, some eighty miles from the coast, we came to the end of this  \"desert,\" but almost the only difference to be noticed in the character  of the country was that the colour of the dust had changed. As our  train sped onwards through the level uplands we saw a fine ostrich  striding along parallel with the line, as if having a race with us. Dr.  McCulloch at once seized his rifle and by a lucky shot brought down the  huge bird; the next and greater difficulty, however, was to secure the  prize. For a time the engine-driver took no notice of our signals and  shouts, but at last we succeeded in attracting his attention, and the  train was shunted back to where the ostrich had fallen. We found it to  be an exceptionally fine specimen, and had to exert all our strength to  drag it on board the train.    Soon after this we reached Voi, about a hundred miles from the coast,  and as this was the most important station on the line that we had yet  come to, we made a short halt in order to inspect some construction  work which was going on. On resuming our journey, we soon discovered  that a pleasant change had occurred in the character of the landscape.  From a place called N'dii, the railway runs for some miles through a  beautifully wooded country, which looked all the more inviting after  the deadly monotony of the wilderness through which we had just passed.  To the south of us could be seen the N'dii range of mountains, the  dwelling-place of the Wa Taita people, while on our right rose the  rigid brow of the N'dungu Escarpment, which stretches away westwards  for scores of miles. Here our journey was slow, as every now and again  we stopped to inspect the permanent works in progress; but eventually,  towards dusk, we arrived at our destination, Tsavo. I slept that night  in a little palm hut which had been built by some previous traveller,  and which was fortunately unoccupied for the time being. It was rather  broken-down and dilapidated, not even possessing a door, and as I lay  on my narrow camp bed I could see the stars twinkling through the roof.  I little knew then what adventures awaited me in this neighbourhood;  and if I had realised that at that very time two savage brutes were  prowling round, seeking whom they might devour, I hardly think I should  have slept so peacefully in my rickety"]]]
