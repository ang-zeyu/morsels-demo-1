So, in the  cloister of Godstow, a petrified tree was shown of which the nuns  told that the fair Rosamond, who had died among them, had  declared that, the tree being then alive and green, it would be  changed into stone at the hour of her salvation.  When Abelard  died, like Tannhäuser, he was on his way to Rome.  What might  have happened had he reached his journey's end is uncertain; and  it is in this uncertain twilight that his relation to the general  beliefs of his age has always remained.  In this, as in other things,  he prefigures the character of the Renaissance, that movement in  [7] which, in various ways, the human mind wins for itself a new  kingdom of feeling and sensation and thought, not opposed to but  only beyond and independent of the spiritual system then actually  realised.  The opposition into which Abelard is thrown, which  gives its colour to his career, which breaks his soul to pieces, is a  no less subtle opposition than that between the merely  professional, official, hireling ministers of that system, with their  ignorant worship of system for its own sake, and the true child of  light, the humanist, with reason and heart and senses quick, while  theirs were almost dead.  He reaches out towards, he attains,  modes of ideal living, beyond the prescribed limits of that  system, though in essential germ, it may be, contained within it.  As always happens, the adherents of the poorer and narrower  culture had no sympathy with, because no understanding of, a  culture richer and more ample than their own.  After the  discovery of wheat they would still live upon acorns--après  l'invention du blé ils voulaient encore vivre du gland; and would  hear of no service to the higher needs of humanity with  instruments not of their forging.    But the human spirit, bold through those needs, was too strong  for them.  Abelard and Heloïse write their letters--letters with a  wonderful outpouring of soul--in medieval Latin; and Abelard,  though he composes songs in the vulgar tongue, writes also in  Latin those [8] treatises in which he tries to find a ground of  reality below the abstractions of philosophy, as one bent on  trying all things by their congruity with human experience, who  had felt the hand of Heloïse, and looked into her eyes, and tested  the resources of humanity in her great and energetic nature.  Yet  it is only a little later, early in the thirteenth century, that French  prose romance begins; and in one of the pretty volumes of the  Bibliothèque Elzevirienne some of the most striking fragments of  it may be found, edited with much intelligence.  In one of these  thirteenth-century stories, Li Amitiez de Ami et Amile, that free  play of human affection, of the claims of which Abelard's story is  an assertion, makes itself felt in the incidents of a great  friendship, a friendship pure and generous, pushed to a sort of  passionate exaltation, and more than faithful unto death.  Such  comradeship, though instances of it are to be found everywhere,  is still especially a classical motive; Chaucer expressing the  sentiment of it so strongly in an antique tale, that one knows not  whether the love of both Palamon and Arcite for Emelya, or of  those two for each other, is the chiefer subject of the Knight's  Tale--         He cast his eyen upon Emelya,       And therewithal he bleynte and cried, ah!       As that he stongen were unto the herte.    What reader does not refer something of the [9] bitterness of that  cry to the spoiling, already foreseen, of the fair friendship, which  had made the prison of the two lads sweet hitherto with its daily  offices?    The friendship of Amis and Amile is deepened by the romantic  circumstance of an entire personal resemblance between the two  heroes, through which they pass for each other again and again,  and thereby into many strange adventures; that curious interest of  the Doppelgänger, which begins among the stars with the  Dioscuri, being entwined in and out through all the incidents of  the story, like an outward token of the inward similitude of their  souls.  With this, again, is connected, like a second reflection of  that inward similitude, the conceit of two marvellously beautiful  cups, also exactly like each other--children's cups, of wood, but  adorned with gold and precious stones.  These two cups, which  by their resemblance help to bring the friends together at critical  moments, were given to them by the Pope, when he baptized  them at Rome, whither the parents had taken them for that  purpose, in gratitude for their birth.  They cross and recross very  strangely in the narrative, serving the two heroes almost like  living things, and with that well-known effect of a beautiful  object, kept constantly before the eye in a story or poem, of  keeping sensation well awake, and giving a certain air of  refinement to all the scenes into which it enters.  That sense of  fate, which [10] hangs so much of the shaping of human life on  trivial objects, like Othello's strawberry handkerchief, is thereby  heightened, while witness is borne to the enjoyment of beautiful  handiwork by primitive people, their simple wonder at it, so that  they give it an oddly significant place among the factors of a  human history.    Amis and Amile, then, are true to their comradeship through all  trials; and in the end it comes to pass that at a moment of great  need Amis takes the place of Amile in a tournament for life or  death.  \"After this it happened that a leprosy fell upon Amis, so  that his wife would not approach him, and wrought to strangle  him.  He departed therefore from his home, and at last prayed his  servants to carry him to the house of Amile\"; and it is in what  follows that the curious strength of the piece shows itself:--    \"His servants, willing to do as he commanded, carried him to the  place where Amile was; and they began to sound their rattles  before the court of Amile's house, as lepers are accustomed to  do.  And when Amile heard the noise he commanded one of his  servants to carry meat and bread to the sick man, and the cup  which was given to him at Rome filled with good wine.  And  when the servant had done as he was commanded, he returned  and said, Sir, if I had not thy cup in my hand, I should believe  that the cup which the sick man has was thine, for they are alike,  the [11] one to the other, in height and fashion.  And Amile said,  Go quickly and bring him to me.  And when Amis stood before  his comrade Amile demanded of him who he was, and how he  had gotten that cup.  I am of Briquain le Chastel, answered Amis,  and the cup was given to me by the Bishop of Rome, who  baptized me.  And when Amile heard that, he knew that it was his  comrade Amis, who had delivered him from death, and won for  him the daughter of the King of France to be his wife.  And  straightway he fell upon him, and began weeping greatly, and  kissed him.  And when his wife heard that, she ran out with her  hair in disarray, weeping and distressed exceedingly, for she  remembered that it was he who had slain the false Ardres.  And  thereupon they placed him in a fair bed, and said to him, Abide  with us until God's will be accomplished in thee, for all we have  is at thy service.  So he and the two servants abode with them.    \"And it came to pass one night, when Amis and Amile lay in one  chamber without other companions, that God sent His angel  Raphael to Amis, who said to him, Amis, art thou asleep?  And  he, supposing that Amile had called him, answered and said, I am  not asleep, fair comrade!  And the angel said to him, Thou hast  answered well, for thou art the comrade of the heavenly citizens.-  -I am Raphael, the angel of our Lord, and am come to tell thee  how thou mayest be [12] healed; for thy prayers are heard.  Thou  shalt bid Amile, thy comrade, that he slay his two children and  wash thee in their blood, and so thy body shall be made whole.  And Amis said to him, Let not this thing be, that my comrade  should become a murderer for my sake.  But the angel said, It is  convenient that he do this.  And thereupon the angel departed.    \"And Amile also, as if in sleep, heard those words; and he awoke  and said, Who is it, my comrade, that hath spoken with thee?  And Amis answered, No man; only I have prayed to our Lord, as  I am accustomed.  And Amile said, Not so!  but some one hath  spoken with thee.  Then he arose and went to the door of the  chamber; and finding it shut he said, Tell me, my brother, who it  was said those words to thee to-night.  And Amis began to weep  greatly, and told him that it was Raphael, the angel of the Lord,  who had said to him, Amis, our Lord commands thee that thou  bid Amile slay his two children, and wash thee in their blood, and  so thou shalt be healed of thy leprosy.  And Amile was greatly  disturbed at those words, and said, I would have given to thee my  man-servants and my maid-servants and all my goods, and thou  feignest that an angel hath spoken to thee that I should slay my  two children.  And immediately Amis began to weep, and said, I  know that I have spoken to thee a terrible thing, but constrained  thereto; I pray thee cast me not away [13] from the shelter of thy  house.  And Amile answered that what he had covenanted with  him, that he would perform, unto the hour of his death: But I  conjure thee, said he, by the faith which there is between me and  thee, and by our comradeship, and by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#3)"],[1," or  clouds that no permanent features could be seen on its surface. The  best equipped recent observers think they see faint, shadowy patches,  which remain the same from day to day, and which show that the planet  always presents the same face to the sun, as the moon does to the  earth. Others do not accept this conclusion as proved, believing that  these patches may be nothing more than variations of light, shade, and  color caused by the reflection of the sun's light at various angles  from different parts of the planet.    There is also some mystery about the atmosphere of this planet. When  Venus passes nearly between us and the sun, her dark hemisphere is  turned towards us, her bright one being always towards the sun. But she  is not exactly on a line with the sun except on the very rare occasions  of a transit across the sun's disk. Hence, on ordinary occasions, when  she seems very near on a line with the sun, we see a very small part of  the illuminated hemisphere, which now presents the form of a very thin  crescent like the new moon. And this crescent is supposed to be a  little broader than it would be if only half the planet were  illuminated, and to encircle rather more than half the planet. Now,  this is just the effect that would be produced by an atmosphere  refracting the sun's light around the edge of the illuminated  hemisphere.    The difficulty of observations of this kind is such that the conclusion  may be open to doubt. What is seen during transits of Venus over the  sun's disk leads to more certain, but yet very puzzling, conclusions.  The writer will describe what he saw at the Cape of Good Hope during  the transit of December 5, 1882. As the dark planet impinged on the  bright sun, it of course cut out a round notch from the edge of the  sun. At first, when this notch was small, nothing could be seen of the  outline of that part of the planet which was outside the sun. But when  half the planet was on the sun, the outline of the part still off the  sun was marked by a slender arc of light. A curious fact was that this  arc did not at first span the whole outline of the planet, but only  showed at one or two points. In a few moments another part of the  outline appeared, and then another, until, at last, the arc of light  extended around the complete outline. All this seems to show that while  the planet has an atmosphere, it is not transparent like ours, but is  so filled with mist and clouds that the sun is seen through it only as  if shining in a fog.    Not many years ago the planet Mars, which is the next one outside of  us, was supposed to have a surface like that of our earth. Some parts  were of a dark greenish gray hue; these were supposed to be seas and  oceans. Other parts had a bright, warm tint; these were supposed to be  the continents. During the last twenty years much has been learned as  to how this planet looks, and the details of its surface have been  mapped by several observers, using the best telescopes under the most  favorable conditions of air and climate. And yet it must be confessed  that the result of this labor is not altogether satisfactory. It seems  certain that the so-called seas are really land and not water. When it  comes to comparing Mars with the earth, we cannot be certain of more  than a single point of resemblance. This is that during the Martian  winter a white cap, as of snow, is formed over the pole, which  partially melts away during the summer. The conclusion that there are  oceans whose evaporation forms clouds which give rise to this snow  seems plausible. But the telescope shows no clouds, and nothing to make  it certain that there is an atmosphere to sustain them. There is no  certainty that the white deposit is what we call snow; perhaps it is  not formed of water at all. The most careful studies of the surface of  this planet, under the best conditions, are those made at the Lowell  Observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona. Especially wonderful is the system  of so-called canals, first seen by Schiaparelli, but mapped in great  detail at Flagstaff. But the nature and meaning of these mysterious  lines are still to be discovered. The result is that the question of  the real nature of the surface of Mars and of what we should see around  us could we land upon it and travel over it are still among the  unsolved problems of astronomy.    If this is the case with the nearest planets that we can study, how is  it with more distant ones? Jupiter is the only one of these of the  condition of whose surface we can claim to have definite knowledge. But  even this knowledge is meagre. The substance of what we know is that  its surface is surrounded by layers of what look like dense clouds,  through which nothing can certainly be seen.    I have already spoken of the heat of the sun and its probable origin.  But the question of its heat, though the most important, is not the  only one that the sun offers us. What is the sun? When we say that it  is a very hot globe, more than a million times as large as the earth,  and hotter than any furnace that man can make, so that literally \"the  elements melt with fervent heat\" even at its surface, while inside they  are all vaporized, we have told the most that we know as to what the  sun really is. Of course we know a great deal about the spots, the  rotation of the sun on its axis, the materials of which it is composed,  and how its surroundings look during a total eclipse. But all this does  not answer our question. There are several mysteries which ingenious  men have tried to explain, but they cannot prove their explanations to  be correct. One is the cause and nature of the spots. Another is that  the shining surface of the sun, the \"photosphere,\" as it is technically  called, seems so calm and quiet while forces are acting within it of a  magnitude quite beyond our conception. Flames in which our earth and  everything on it would be engulfed like a boy's marble in a  blacksmith's forge are continually shooting up to a height of tens of  thousands of miles. One would suppose that internal forces capable of  doing this would break the surface up into billows of fire a thousand  miles high; but we see nothing of the kind. The surface of the sun  seems almost as placid as a lake.    Yet another mystery is the corona of the sun. This is something we  should never have known to exist if the sun were not sometimes totally  eclipsed by the dark body of the moon. On these rare occasions the sun  is seen to be surrounded by a halo of soft, white light, sending out  rays in various directions to great distances. This halo is called the  corona, and has been most industriously studied and photographed during  nearly every total eclipse for thirty years. Thus we have learned much  about how it looks and what its shape is. It has a fibrous, woolly  structure, a little like the loose end of a much-worn hempen rope. A  certain resemblance has been seen between the form of these seeming  fibres and that of the lines in which iron filings arrange themselves  when sprinkled on paper over a magnet. It has hence been inferred that  the sun has magnetic properties, a conclusion which, in a general way,  is supported by many other facts. Yet the corona itself remains no less  an unexplained phenomenon.    [Illustration with caption: PHOTOGRAPH OF THE CORONA OF THE SUN, TAKEN  IN TRIPOLI DURING TOTAL ECLIPSE OF AUGUST 30, 1905]    A phenomenon almost as mysterious as the solar corona is the \"zodiacal  light,\" which any one can see rising from the western horizon just  after the end of twilight on a clear winter or spring evening. The most  plausible explanation is that it is due to a cloud of small meteoric  bodies revolving round the sun. We should hardly doubt this explanation  were it not that this light has a yet more mysterious appendage,  commonly called the Gegenschein, or counter-glow. This is a patch of  light in the sky in a direction exactly opposite that of the sun. It is  so faint that it can be seen only by a practised eye under the most  favorable conditions. But it is always there. The latest suggestion is  that it is a tail of the earth, of the same kind as the tail of a comet!    We know that the motions of the heavenly bodies are predicted with  extraordinary exactness by the theory of gravitation. When one finds  that the exact path of the moon's shadow on the earth during a total  eclipse of the sun can be mapped out many years in advance, and that  the planets follow the predictions of the astronomer so closely that,  if you could see the predicted planet as a separate object, it would  look, even in a good telescope, as if it exactly fitted over the real  planet, one thinks that here at least is a branch of astronomy which is  simply perfect. And yet the worlds themselves show slight deviations in  their movements which the astronomer cannot always explain, and which  may be due to some hidden cause that, when brought to light, shall lead  to conclusions of the greatest importance to our race.    One of these deviations is in the rotation of the earth. Sometimes, for  several years at a time, it seems to revolve a little faster, and then  again a little slower. The changes are very slight; they can be  detected only by the most laborious and refined methods; yet they must  have a cause, and we should like to know what that cause is.    The moon shows a similar irregularity of motion. For half a century,  perhaps through a whole century, she will go around the earth a little  ahead of her regular rate, and then for another half-century or more  she will fall behind. The changes are very small; they would never have  been seen with the unaided eye, yet they exist. What is their cause?  Mathematicians have vainly spent years of study in trying to answer  this question.    The orbit of Mercury is found by observations to have a slight motion  which mathematicians have vainly tried to explain. For some time "]]]
