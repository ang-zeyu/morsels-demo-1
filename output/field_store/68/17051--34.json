She  is engaging in her manners, her conversation lively and entertaining.  Miss Reynolds told the Doctor of all our rapturous exclamations on the  road. He shook his scientific head at Hannah, and said she was 'a silly  thing.' When our visit was ended, he called for his hat, as it rained,  to attend us down a very long entry to our coach, and not Rasselas could  have acquitted himself more _en cavalier_. I forgot to mention, that not  finding Johnson in his little parlour when we came in, Hannah seated  herself in his great chair hoping to catch a little ray of his genius:  when he heard it, he laughed heartily, and told her it was a chair on  which he never sat. He said it reminded him of Boswell and himself when  they stopped a night, as they imagined, where the weird sisters appeared  to Macbeth. The idea so worked on their enthusiasm, that it quite  deprived them of rest. However, they learned the next morning, to their  mortification, that they had been deceived, and were quite in another  part of the country.\"           *       *       *       *       *      MISS MITFORD'S FAREWELL TO THREE MILE CROSS.    When Miss Mitford left her rustic cottage at Three Mile Cross, and  removed to Reading, (the Belford Regis of her novel), she penned the  following beautiful picture of its homely joys--    \"Farewell, then, my beloved village! the long, straggling street, gay  and bright on this sunny, windy April morning, full of all implements of  dirt and mire, men, women, children, cows, horses, wagons, carts, pigs,  dogs, geese, and chickens--busy, merry, stirring little world, farewell!  Farewell to the winding, up-hill road, with its clouds of dust, as  horsemen and carriages ascend the gentle eminence, its borders of turf,  and its primrosy hedges! Farewell to the breezy common, with its islands  of cottages and cottage-gardens; its oaken avenues, populous with rooks;  its clear waters fringed with gorse, where lambs are straying; its  cricket-ground where children already linger, anticipating their summer  revelry; its pretty boundary of field and woodland, and distant farms;  and latest and best of its ornaments, the dear and pleasant mansion  where dwelt the neighbours, the friends of friends; farewell to ye all!  Ye will easily dispense with me, but what I shall do without you, I  cannot imagine. Mine own dear village, farewell!\"           *       *       *       *       *      SMOLLETT'S \"HUGH STRAP.\"    In the year 1809 was interred, in the churchyard of St. Martin's in the  Fields, the body of one Hew Hewson, who died at the age of 85. He was  the original of Hugh Strap, in Smollett's _Roderick Random_. Upwards of  forty years he kept a hair-dresser's shop in St. Martin's parish; the  walls were hung round with Latin quotations, and he would frequently  point out to his customers and acquaintances the several scenes in  _Roderick Random_ pertaining to himself, which had their origin, not in  Smollett's inventive fancy, but in truth and reality. The meeting in a  barber's shop at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the subsequent mistake at the inn,  their arrival together in London, and the assistance they experienced  from Strap's friend, are all facts. The barber left behind an annotated  copy of _Roderick Random_, showing how far we are indebted to the genius  of the author, and to what extent the incidents are founded in reality.           *       *       *       *       *      COLLINS'S POEMS.    Mr. John Ragsdale, of Richmond, in Surrey, who was the intimate friend  of Collins, states that some of his Odes were written while on a visit  at his, Mr. Ragsdale's house. The poet, however, had such a poor opinion  of his own productions, that after showing them to Mr. Ragsdale, he  would snatch them from him, and throw them into the fire; and in this  way, it is believed, many of Collins's finest pieces were destroyed.  Such of his Odes as were published, on his own account in 1746, were not  popular; and, disappointed at the slowness of the sale, the poet burnt  the remaining copies with his own hands.           *       *       *       *       *      CAPTAIN MORRIS'S SONGS.    Alas! poor Morris--writes one--we knew him well. Who that has once read  or heard his songs, can forget their rich and graceful imagery; the  fertile fancy, the touching sentiment, and the \"soul reviving\" melody,  which characterize every line of these delightful lyrics? Well do we  remember, too, his \"old buff waistcoat,\" his courteous manner, and his  gentlemanly pleasantry, long after this Nestor of song had retired to  enjoy the delights of rural life, despite the prayer of his racy verse:     \"In town let me live, then, in town let me die;    For in truth I can't relish the country, not I.    If one must have a villa in summer to dwell;    Oh! give me the sweet, shady side of Pall Mall.\"    Captain Morris was born about the middle of the last century, and  outlived the majority of the _bon vivant_ society which he gladdened  with his genius, and lit up with his brilliant humour.    Yet, many readers of the present generation may ask, \"Who was Captain  Morris?\" He was born of good family, in the celebrated year 1745, and  appears to have inherited a taste for literary composition; for his  father composed the popular song of _Kitty Crowder_.    For more than half a century, Captain Morris moved in the first circles.  He was the \"sun of the table\" at Carlton House, as well as at Norfolk  House; and attaching himself politically, as well as convivially, to his  dinner companions, he composed the celebrated ballads of \"Billy's too  young to drive us,\" and \"Billy Pitt and the Farmer,\" which continued  long in fashion, as brilliant satires upon the ascendant politics of  their day. His humorous ridicule of the Tories was, however, but ill  repaid by the Whigs upon their accession to office; at least, if we may  trust the beautiful ode of \"The Old Whig Poet to his Old Buff Waistcoat.\"  We are not aware of this piece being included in any edition of the  \"Songs.\" It bears date \"G. R., August 1, 1815;\" six years subsequent to  which we saw it among the papers of the late Alexander Stephens.    Captain Morris's \"Songs\" were very popular. In 1830, we possessed a copy  of the 24th edition; we remember one of the ditties to have been \"sung  by the Prince of Wales to a certain lady,\" to the air of \"There's a  difference between a beggar and a queen.\" Morris's finest Anacreontic,  is the song _Ad Poculum_, for which he received the gold cup of the  Harmonic Society:     \"Come thou soul-reviving cup!      Try thy healing art;    Stir the fancy's visions up,      And warm my wasted heart.      Touch with freshening tints of bliss       Memory's fading dream;    Give me, while thy lip I kiss,       The heaven that's in thy stream.\"    Of the famous Beefsteak Club, (at first limited to twenty-four members,  but increased to twenty-five, to admit the Prince of Wales,) Captain  Morris was the laureat; of this \"Jovial System\" he was the intellectual  centre. In the year 1831, he bade adieu to the club, in some spirited  stanzas, though penned at \"an age far beyond mortal lot.\" In 1835, he  was permitted to revisit the club, when they presented him with a large  silver bowl, appropriately inscribed.    It would not be difficult to string together gems from the Captain's  Lyrics. In \"The Toper's Apology,\" one of his most sparkling songs,  occurs this brilliant version of Addison's comparison of wits with  flying fish:--     \"My Muse, too, when her wings are dry,     No frolic flight will take;    But round a bowl she'll dip and fly,     Like swallows round a lake.    Then, if the nymph will have her share     Before she'll bless her swain,    Why that I think's a reason fair     To fill my glass again.\"    Many years since, Captain Morris retired to a villa at Brockham,  near the foot of Box Hill, in Surrey. This property, it is said, was  presented to him by his old friend, the Duke of Norfolk. Here the  Captain \"drank the pure pleasures of the rural life\" long after many  a bright light of his own time had flickered out, and become almost  forgotten; even \"the sweet, shady side of Pall Mall\" had almost  disappeared, and with it the princely house whereat he was wont to  shine. He died July 11, 1835, in his ninety-third year, of internal  inflammation of only four days.    Morris presented a rare combination of mirth and prudence, such as human  conduct seldom offers for our imitation. He retained his _gaiete de  coeur_ to the last; so that, with equal truth and spirit, he  remonstrated:     \"When life charms my heart, must I kindly be told,    I'm too gay and too happy for one that's so old.\"    Captain Morris left his autobiography to his family; but it has not been  published.           *       *       *       *       *      LITERARY DINNERS.    Incredible as it may appear, it is sometimes stated very confidently,  that English authors and actors who give dinners, are treated with greater  indulgence by certain critics than those who do not. But, it has never  been said that any critical journal in England, with the slightest  pretensions to respectability, was in the habit of levying black mail in  this Rob Roy fashion, upon writers or articles of any kind. Yet it is  alleged, on high authority, that many of the French critical journals  are or were principally supported from such a source. For example, there  is a current anecdote to the effect that when the celebrated singer  Nourrit died, the editor of one of the musical reviews waited on his  successor, Duprez, and, with a profusion of compliments and apologies,  intimated to him that Nourrit had invariably allowed 2000 francs a year  to the review. Duprez, taken rather aback, expressed his readiness to  allow half that sum. \"_Bien, monsieur_,\" said the editor, with a shrug,  \"_mais, parole d'honneur, j'y perds mille"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],[0,"Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#3)"],[1,"and diver in one,    Diving wherever it pleased him, taking instructions from none;    Hither and thither he wandered, steering by stars and by sun.      Fearless he was beyond credence, looking at death eye to eye:    This was his formula always, 'All man go dead by-and-bye --    S'posing time come no can help it -- s'pose time no come, then no die.'      Dived in the depths of the Darnleys, down twenty fathom and five;    Down where by law and by reason, men are forbidden to dive;    Down in a pressure so awful that only the strongest survive:      Sweated four men at the air pumps, fast as the handles could go,    Forcing the air down that reached him heated, and tainted, and slow --    Kanzo Makame the diver stayed seven minutes below;      Came up on deck like a dead man, paralysed body and brain;    Suffered, while blood was returning, infinite tortures of pain:    Sailed once again to the Darnleys -- laughed and descended again!           .    .    .    .    .      Scarce grew the shell in the shallows, rarely a patch could they touch;    Always the take was so little, always the labour so much;    Always they thought of the Islands held by the lumbering Dutch,      Islands where shell was in plenty lying in passage and bay,    Islands where divers could gather hundreds of shell in a day:    But the lumbering Dutch, with their gunboats, hunted the divers away.      Joe Nagasaki, the 'tender', finding the profits grow small,    Said, 'Let us go to the Islands, try for a number one haul!    If we get caught, go to prison -- let them take lugger and all!'      Kanzo Makame, the diver -- knowing full well what it meant --    Fatalist, gambler, and stoic, smiled a broad smile of content,    Flattened in mainsail and foresail, and off to the Islands they went.      Close to the headlands they drifted, picking up shell by the ton,    Piled up on deck were the oysters, opening wide in the sun,    When, from the lee of the headland, boomed the report of a gun.      Once that the diver was sighted pearl-shell and lugger must go.    Joe Nagasaki decided -- quick was the word and the blow --    Cut both the pipe and the life-line, leaving the diver below!      Kanzo Makame, the diver, failing to quite understand,    Pulled the 'haul up' on the life-line, found it was slack in his hand;    Then, like a little brown stoic, lay down and died on the sand.      Joe Nagasaki, the 'tender', smiling a sanctified smile,    Headed her straight for the gunboat -- throwing out shells all the while --    Then went aboard and reported, 'No makee dive in three mile!      'Dress no have got and no helmet -- diver go shore on the spree;    Plenty wind come and break rudder -- lugger get blown out to sea:    Take me to Japanee Consul, he help a poor Japanee!'           .    .    .    .    .      So the Dutch let him go, and they watched him, as off from the Islands he ran,    Doubting him much, but what would you?  You have to be sure of your man    Ere you wake up that nest-full of hornets -- the little brown men of Japan.      Down in the ooze and the coral, down where earth's wonders are spread,    Helmeted, ghastly, and swollen, Kanzo Makame lies dead:    Joe Nagasaki, his 'tender', is owner and diver instead.      Wearer of pearls in your necklace, comfort yourself if you can,    These are the risks of the pearling -- these are the ways of Japan,    'Plenty more Japanee diver, plenty more little brown man!'          The City of Dreadful Thirst          The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke --    'They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-minded folk.    But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define    A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine.      'Last summer up in Narromine 'twas gettin' rather warm --    Two hundred in the water-bag, and lookin' like a storm --    We all were in the private bar, the coolest place in town,    When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin' down,      'We don't respect the clouds up there, they fill us with disgust,    They mostly bring a Bogan shower -- three rain-drops and some dust;    But each man, simultaneous-like, to each man said, \"I think    That cloud suggests it's up to us to have another drink!\"      'There's clouds of rain and clouds of dust -- we'd heard of them before,    And sometimes in the daily press we read of \"clouds of war\":    But -- if this ain't the Gospel truth I hope that I may burst --    That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst.      'It wasn't like a common cloud, 'twas more a sort of haze;    It settled down about the streets, and stopped for days and days,    And not a drop of dew could fall and not a sunbeam shine    To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine.      'Oh, Lord! we had a dreadful time beneath that cloud of thirst!    We all chucked-up our daily work and went upon the burst.    The very blacks about the town that used to cadge for grub,    They made an organised attack and tried to loot the pub.      'We couldn't leave the private bar no matter how we tried;    Shearers and squatters, union-men and blacklegs side by side    Were drinkin' there and dursn't move, for each was sure, he said,    Before he'd get a half-a-mile the thirst would strike him dead!      'We drank until the drink gave out, we searched from room to room,    And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went howling through the gloom.    The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again,    But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to the train.      'And, once outside the cloud of thirst, we felt as right as pie,    But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die.    But now I hear it's safe enough, I'm going back to work    Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke.      'But when you see those clouds about -- like this one over here --    All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint of beer,    It's time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud should burst    You'd find the drink would all be gone, for that's a cloud of thirst!'           .    .    .    .    .      We stood the man from Narromine a pint of half-and-half;    He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous quaff;    'I joined some friends last night,' he said, 'in what THEY called a spree;    But after Narromine 'twas just a holiday to me.'      And now beyond the Western Range, where sunset skies are red,    And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drifting overhead,    The railway-train is taking back, along the Western Line,    That narrow-minded person on his road to Narromine.          Saltbush Bill's Gamecock          'Twas Saltbush Bill, with his travelling sheep, was making his way to town;    He crossed them over the Hard Times Run, and he came to the Take 'Em Down;    He counted through at the boundary gate, and camped at the drafting yard:    For Stingy Smith, of the Hard Times Run, had hunted him rather hard.    He bore no malice to Stingy Smith -- 'twas simply the hand of fate    That caused his waggon to swerve aside and shatter old Stingy's gate;    And, being only the hand of fate, it follows, without a doubt,    It wasn't the fault of Saltbush Bill that Stingy's sheep got out.    So Saltbush Bill, with an easy heart, prepared for what might befall,    Commenced his stages on Take 'Em Down, the station of Rooster Hall.      'Tis strange how often the men out back will take to some curious craft,    Some ruling passion to keep their thoughts away from the overdraft;    And Rooster Hall, of the Take 'Em Down, was widely known to fame    As breeder of champion fighting cocks -- his 'forte' was the British Game.    The passing stranger within his gates that camped with old Rooster Hall    Was forced to talk about fowls all night, or else not talk at all.    Though droughts should come, and though sheep should die,      his fowls were his sole delight;    He left his shed in the flood of work to watch two gamecocks fight.    He held in scorn the Australian Game, that long-legged child of sin;    In a desperate fight, with the steel-tipped spurs, the British Game must win!    The Australian bird was a mongrel bird, with a touch of the jungle cock;    The want of breeding must find him out, when facing the English stock;    For British breeding, and British pluck, must triumph it over all --    And that was the root of the simple creed that governed old Rooster Hall.           .    .    .    .    .      'Twas Saltbush Bill to the station rode ahead of his travelling sheep,    And sent a message to Rooster Hall that wakened him out of his sleep --    A crafty message that fetched him out, and hurried him as he came --    'A drover has an Australian Bird to match with your British Game.'    'Twas done, and done in a half a trice; a five-pound note aside;    Old Rooster Hall, with his champion bird, and the drover's bird untried.    'Steel spurs, of course?' said old Rooster Hall;      'you'll need 'em, without a doubt!'    'You stick the spurs on your bird!' said Bill, 'but mine fights best without.'    'Fights best without?' said old Rooster Hall; 'he can't fight best unspurred!    You must be crazy!'  But Saltbush Bill said, 'Wait till you see my bird!'    So Rooster Hall to his fowlyard went, and quickly back he came,    Bearing a clipt and a shaven cock, the pride of his English Game.    With an eye as fierce as an eaglehawk, and a crow like a trumpet call,    He strutted about on the garden walk, and cackled at Rooster Hall.    Then Rooster Hall sent off a boy with word to his cronies two,    McCrae (the boss of the Black Police) and Father Donahoo.    Full many a cockfight old McCrae had held in his empty Court,    With Father D. as a picker-up -- a regular all-round Sport!    They got the message of Rooster Hall, and down to his run they came,    Prepared to scoff at the drover's bird, and to bet on the English Game;    They hied them off to the drover's camp,"]]]
