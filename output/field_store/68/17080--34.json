It is the curse of civilization  falling upon the birds which come too near man. The vermin, or the germ  of the vermin, is probably conveyed to the nest in hen's feathers, or in  straws and hairs picked up about the barn or hen-house. A robin's nest  upon your porch or in your summer-house will occasionally become an  intolerable nuisance from the swarms upon swarms of minute vermin with  which it is filled. The parent birds stem the tide as long as they can,  but are often compelled to leave the young to their terrible fate.    One season a phoebe-bird built on a projecting stone under the eaves  of the house, and all appeared to go well till the young were nearly  fledged, when the nest suddenly became a bit of purgatory. The birds  kept their places in their burning bed till they could hold no longer,  when they leaped forth and fell dead upon the ground.    After a delay of a week or more, during which I imagine the parent  birds purified themselves by every means known to them, the couple built  another nest a few yards from the first, and proceeded to rear a second  brood; but the new nest developed into the same bed of torment that the  first did, and the three young birds, nearly ready to fly, perished as  they sat within it. The parent birds then left the place as if it had  been accursed.    I imagine the smaller birds have an enemy in our native white-footed  mouse, though I have not proof enough to convict him. But one season the  nest of a chickadee which I was observing was broken up in a position  where nothing but a mouse could have reached it. The bird had chosen a  cavity in the limb of an apple-tree which stood but a few yards from the  house. The cavity was deep, and the entrance to it, which was ten feet  from the ground, was small. Barely light enough was admitted, when the  sun was in the most favorable position, to enable one to make out the  number of eggs, which was six, at the bottom of the dim interior. While  one was peering in and trying to get his head out of his own light, the  bird would startle him by a queer kind of puffing sound. She would not  leave her nest like most birds, but really tried to blow or scare the  intruder away; and after repeated experiments I could hardly refrain  from jerking my head back when that little explosion of sound came  up from the dark interior. One night, when incubation was about half  finished, the nest was harried. A slight trace of hair or fur at the  entrance led me to infer that some small animal was the robber. A weasel  might have done it, as they sometimes climb trees, but I doubt if either  a squirrel or a rat could have passed the entrance.    Probably few persons have ever suspected the cat-bird of being an  egg-sucker; I do not know that she has ever been accused of such a  thing, but there is something uncanny and disagreeable about her, which  I at once understood, when I one day caught her in the very act of going  through a nest of eggs.    A pair of the least fly-catchers, the bird which says chebec, chebec,  and is a small edition of the pewee, one season built their nest where  I had them for many hours each day under my observation. The nest was  a very snug and compact structure placed in the forks of a small maple  about twelve feet from the ground. The season before, a red squirrel  had harried the nest of a wood-thrush in this same tree, and I was  apprehensive that he would serve the fly-catchers the same trick; so,  as I sat with my book in a summer-house near by, I kept my loaded gun  within easy reach. One egg was laid, and the next morning, as I made my  daily inspection of the nest, only a fragment of its empty shell was  to be found. This I removed, mentally imprecating the rogue of a red  squirrel. The birds were much disturbed by the event, but did not desert  the nest, as I had feared they would, but after much inspection of it  and many consultations together, concluded, it seems, to try again. Two  more eggs were laid, when one day I heard the birds utter a sharp cry,  and on looking up I saw a cat-bird perched upon the rim of the nest,  hastily devouring the eggs. I soon regretted my precipitation in killing  her, because such interference is generally unwise. It turned out  that she had a nest of her own with five eggs in a spruce-tree near my  window.    Then this pair of little fly-catchers did what I had never seen birds  do before; they pulled the nest to pieces and rebuilt it in a peach-tree  not many rods away, where a brood was successfully reared. The nest was  here exposed to the direct rays of the noon-day sun, and to shield her  young when the heat was greatest, the mother-bird would stand above them  with wings slightly spread, as other birds have been know to do under  like circumstances.    To what extent the cat-bird is a nest-robber I have no evidence, but  that feline mew of hers, and that flirting, flexible tail, suggest  something not entirely bird-like.    Probably the darkest tragedy of the nest is enacted when a snake  plunders it. All birds and animals, so far I have observed, behave in  a peculiar manner toward a snake. They seem to feel something of the  loathing toward it that the human species experiences. The bark of a dog  when he encounters a snake is different from that which he gives out on  any other occasion; it is a mingled note of alarm, inquiry, and disgust.    One day a tragedy was enacted a few yards from where I was sitting with  a book; two song-sparrows trying to defend their nest against a black  snake. The curious, interrogating note of a chicken who had suddenly  come upon the scene in his walk caused me to look up from my reading.  There were the sparrows, with wings raised in a way peculiarly  expressive of horror and dismay, rushing about a low clump of grass and  bushes. Then, looking more closely, I saw the glistening form of the  black snake and the quick movement of his head as he tried to seize the  birds. The sparrows darted about and through the grass and weeds, trying  to beat the snake off. Their tails and wings were spread, and, panting  with the heat and the desperate struggle, they presented a most singular  spectacle. They uttered no cry, not a sound escaped them; they were  plainly speechless with horror and dismay. Not once did they drop their  wings, and the peculiar expression of those uplifted palms, as it were,  I shall never forget. It occurred to me that perhaps here was a case of  attempted bird-charming on the part of the snake, so I looked on from  behind the fence. The birds charged the snake and harassed him from  every side, but were evidently under no spell save that of courage in  defending their nest. Every moment or two I could see the head and neck  of the serpent make a sweep at the birds, when the one struck at would  fall back, and the other would renew the assault from the rear. There  appeared to be little danger that the snake could strike and hold one of  the birds, though I trembled for them, they were so bold and approached  so near to the snake's head. Time and again he sprang at them, but  without success. How the poor things panted, and held up their wings  appealingly! Then the snake glided off to the near fence, barely  escaping the stone which I hurled at him. I found the nest rifled and  deranged; whether it had contained eggs or young I know not. The male  sparrow had cheered me many a day with his song, and I blamed myself for  not having rushed at once to the rescue, when the arch enemy was upon  him. There is probably little truth in the popular notion that snakes  charm birds. The black snake is the most subtle, alert, and devilish of  our snakes, and I have never seen him have any but young, helpless birds  in his mouth.    We have one parasitical bird, the cow-bird, so-called because it walks  about amid the grazing cattle and seizes the insects which their heavy  tread sets going, which is an enemy of most of the smaller birds. It  drops its egg in the nest of the song-sparrow, the social sparrow, the  snow-bird, the vireos, and the wood-warblers, and as a rule it is the  only egg in the nest that issues successfully. Either the eggs of  the rightful owner of the nest are not hatched, or else the young are  overridden and overreached by the parasite and perish prematurely.    Among the worst enemies of our birds are the so-called \"collectors,\" men  who plunder nests and murder their owners in the name of science. Not  the genuine ornithologist, for no one is more careful of squandering  bird life than he; but the sham ornithologist, the man whose vanity or  affectation happens to take an ornithological turn. He is seized with an  itching for a collection of eggs and birds because it happens to be the  fashion, or because it gives him the air of a man of science. But in the  majority of cases the motive is a mercenary one; the collector expects  to sell these spoils of the groves and orchards. Robbing the nests  and killing birds becomes a business with him. He goes about it  systematically, and becomes expert in circumventing and slaying our  songsters. Every town of any considerable size is infested with one or  more of these bird highwaymen, and every nest in the country round about  that the wretches can lay hands on is harried. Their professional term  for a nest of eggs is \"a clutch,\" a word that well expresses the work of  their grasping, murderous fingers. They clutch and destroy in the germ  the life and music of the woodlands. Certain of our natural history  journals are mainly organs of communication between these human weasels.  They record their exploits at nest-robbing and bird-slaying in their  columns. One collector tells with gusto how he \"worked his way\" through  an orchard, ransacking every tree, and leaving, as he believed, not one  nest behind him. He had better not be caught working his way through my"]]]
