[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/353"],[0,"In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems (#3)"],[1,"             Where men, like wolves, slunk through the grim half-light;            And sudden, in the midst of it, there came             One who spoke boldly for the cause of Right.              And speaking, fell before that brutish race             Like some poor wren that shrieking eagles tear,            While brute Dishonour, with her bloodless face             Stood by and smote his lips that moved in prayer.              \"Speak not of God!  In centuries that word             Hath not been uttered!  Our own king are we.\"            And God stretched forth his finger as He heard             And o'er it cast a thousand leagues of sea.          Disarmament                  One spake amid the nations, \"Let us cease             From darkening with strife the fair World's light,            We who are great in war be great in peace.             No longer let us plead the cause by might.\"              But from a million British graves took birth             A silent voice -- the million spake as one --            \"If ye have righted all the wrongs of earth             Lay by the sword!  Its work and ours is done.\"          The Dead Master                  Amid earth's vagrant noises, he caught the note sublime:            To-day around him surges from the silences of Time            A flood of nobler music, like a river deep and broad,            Fit song for heroes gathered in the banquet-hall of God.          The Harvest of the Sea                  The earth grows white with harvest; all day long             The sickles gleam, until the darkness weaves            Her web of silence o'er the thankful song             Of reapers bringing home the golden sheaves.              The wave tops whiten on the sea fields drear,             And men go forth at haggard dawn to reap;            But ever 'mid the gleaners' song we hear             The half-hushed sobbing of the hearts that weep.          The Dying of Pere Pierre                   \". . . with two other priests; the same night he died,                 and was buried by the shores of the lake that bears his name.\"                                                                   Chronicle.                \"Nay, grieve not that ye can no honour give             To these poor bones that presently must be            But carrion; since I have sought to live             Upon God's earth, as He hath guided me,            I shall not lack!  Where would ye have me lie?             High heaven is higher than cathedral nave:            Do men paint chancels fairer than the sky?\"             Beside the darkened lake they made his grave,            Below the altar of the hills; and night             Swung incense clouds of mist in creeping lines            That twisted through the tree-trunks, where the light             Groped through the arches of the silent pines:            And he, beside the lonely path he trod,            Lay, tombed in splendour, in the House of God.          Eventide                  The day is past and the toilers cease;            The land grows dim 'mid the shadows grey,            And hearts are glad, for the dark brings peace                        At the close of day.              Each weary toiler, with lingering pace,            As he homeward turns, with the long day done,            Looks out to the west, with the light on his face                        Of the setting sun.              Yet some see not (with their sin-dimmed eyes)            The promise of rest in the fading light;            But the clouds loom dark in the angry skies                        At the fall of night.              And some see only a golden sky            Where the elms their welcoming arms stretch wide            To the calling rooks, as they homeward fly                        At the eventide.              It speaks of peace that comes after strife,            Of the rest He sends to the hearts He tried,            Of the calm that follows the stormiest life --                        God's eventide.          Upon Watts' Picture \"Sic Transit\"                   _\"What I spent I had; what I saved, I lost; what I gave, I have.\"_                But yesterday the tourney, all the eager joy of life,             The waving of the banners, and the rattle of the spears,            The clash of sword and harness, and the madness of the strife;             To-night begin the silence and the peace of endless years.                        (One sings within.)              But yesterday the glory and the prize,             And best of all, to lay it at her feet,            To find my guerdon in her speaking eyes:             I grudge them not, -- they pass, albeit sweet.              The ring of spears, the winning of the fight,             The careless song, the cup, the love of friends,            The earth in spring -- to live, to feel the light --             'Twas good the while it lasted:  here it ends.              Remain the well-wrought deed in honour done,             The dole for Christ's dear sake, the words that fall            In kindliness upon some outcast one, --             They seemed so little:  now they are my All.          A Song of Comfort                   _\"Sleep, weary ones, while ye may --                     Sleep, oh, sleep!\"_                                          Eugene Field.                Thro' May time blossoms, with whisper low,            The soft wind sang to the dead below:             \"Think not with regret on the Springtime's song             And the task ye left while your hands were strong.             The song would have ceased when the Spring was past,             And the task that was joyous be weary at last.\"              To the winter sky when the nights were long            The tree-tops tossed with a ceaseless song:             \"Do ye think with regret on the sunny days             And the path ye left, with its untrod ways?             The sun might sink in a storm cloud's frown             And the path grow rough when the night came down.\"              In the grey twilight of the autumn eves,            It sighed as it sang through the dying leaves:             \"Ye think with regret that the world was bright,             That your path was short and your task was light;             The path, though short, was perhaps the best             And the toil was sweet, that it led to rest.\"          The Pilgrims                  An uphill path, sun-gleams between the showers,             Where every beam that broke the leaden sky            Lit other hills with fairer ways than ours;             Some clustered graves where half our memories lie;            And one grim Shadow creeping ever nigh:                        And this was Life.              Wherein we did another's burden seek,             The tired feet we helped upon the road,            The hand we gave the weary and the weak,             The miles we lightened one another's load,            When, faint to falling, onward yet we strode:                        This too was Life.              Till, at the upland, as we turned to go             Amid fair meadows, dusky in the night,            The mists fell back upon the road below;             Broke on our tired eyes the western light;            The very graves were for a moment bright:                        And this was Death.          The Shadow of the Cross                  At the drowsy dusk when the shadows creep            From the golden west, where the sunbeams sleep,              An angel mused:  \"Is there good or ill            In the mad world's heart, since on Calvary's hill              'Round the cross a mid-day twilight fell            That darkened earth and o'ershadowed hell?\"              Through the streets of a city the angel sped;            Like an open scroll men's hearts he read.              In a monarch's ear his courtiers lied            And humble faces hid hearts of pride.              Men's hate waxed hot, and their hearts grew cold,            As they haggled and fought for the lust of gold.              Despairing, he cried, \"After all these years            Is there naught but hatred and strife and tears?\"              He found two waifs in an attic bare;            -- A single crust was their meagre fare --              One strove to quiet the other's cries,            And the love-light dawned in her famished eyes              As she kissed the child with a motherly air:            \"I don't need mine, you can have my share.\"              Then the angel knew that the earthly cross            And the sorrow and shame were not wholly loss.              At dawn, when hushed was earth's busy hum            And men looked not for their Christ to come,              From the attic poor to the palace grand,            The King and the beggar went hand in hand.          The Night Cometh                  Cometh the night.  The wind falls low,            The trees swing slowly to and fro:             Around the church the headstones grey             Cluster, like children strayed away            But found again, and folded so.              No chiding look doth she bestow:            If she is glad, they cannot know;             If ill or well they spend their day,                        Cometh the night.              Singing or sad, intent they go;            They do not see the shadows grow;             \"There yet is time,\" they lightly say,             \"Before our work aside we lay\";            Their task is but half-done, and lo!                        Cometh the night.          In Due Season                  If night should come and find me at my toil,             When all Life's day I had, tho' faintly, wrought,            And shallow furrows, cleft in stony soil             Were all my labour:  Shall I count it naught              If only one poor gleaner, weak of hand,             Shall pick a scanty sheaf where I have sown?            \"Nay, for of thee the Master doth demand        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#3)"],[1,"aid!\"    \"What! Not suicide?\"    \"Never. An accident, of course.\"    \"How horrible!\" The small hands tightened their grasp upon the reins,  and no other word was spoken until they were passing the school-house,  when she asked--    \"Who was it?\"    \"Charles Brierly, our head teacher, and a good man.\"    Miss Grant was standing at one of the front windows and she leaned  anxiously out as the little trap darted past.    \"We can't stop,\" said Doran, as much to himself as to his companion. \"I  must have the pony, ma'am. Where can I leave you?\"    \"Anywhere here. Is there anything--any message I can deliver? I am a  stranger, but I understand the need of haste. Ought not those pupils to  be sent home?\"    He put his hand upon the reins. \"Stop him,\" he said. \"You are quick to  think, madam. Will you take a message to the school-house--to Miss  Grant?\"    \"Surely.\"    They had passed the school-house and as the pony stopped, Doran sprang  out and offered his hand, which she scarcely touched in alighting.    \"What shall I say?\" she asked as she sprang down.    \"See Miss Grant. Tell her privately that Mr. Brierly has met with an  accident, and that the children must be sent home quietly and at once.  At once, mind.\"    \"I understand.\" She turned away with a quick, nervous movement, but he  stopped her.    \"One moment. Your name, please? Your evidence may be wanted.\"    \"By whom?\"    \"By the coroner; to corroborate our story.\"    \"I see. I am Mrs. Jamieson; at the Glenville House.\"    She turned from him with the last word, and walked swiftly back toward  the school-house.    Hilda Grant was still at the window. She had made no attempt to listen  to recitations, or even to call the roll; and she hastened out, at sight  of the slight black robed figure entering the school yard, her big grey  eyes full of the question her lips refused to frame.    They met at the foot of the steps, and Mrs. Jamieson spoke at once, as  if in reply, to the wordless inquiry in the other's face.    \"I am Mrs. Jamieson,\" she said, speaking low, mindful of the curious  faces peering out from two windows, on either side of the open door. \"I  was stopped by Mr.--\"    \"Mr. Doran?\"    \"Yes. He wished me to tell you that the teacher, Mr. ----\"    \"Brierly?\"    \"Yes; that he has met with an accident; and that you had better close  the school, and send the children home quietly, and at once.\"    \"Oh!\" Suddenly the woman's small figure swayed; she threw out a hand as  if for support and, before the half-dazed girl before her could reach  her, she sank weakly upon the lowest step. \"Oh!\" she sighed again. \"I  did not realise--I--I believe I am frightened!\" And then, as Miss Grant  bent over her, she added weakly: \"Don't mind me. I--I'll rest here a  moment. Send away your pupils; I only need rest.\"    When the wondering children had passed out from the school-rooms, and  were scattering, in slow-moving, eagerly-talking groups, Hilda Grant  stood for a moment beside her desk, rigid and with all the anguish of  her soul revealed, in this instant of solitude, upon her face.    \"He is dead!\" she murmured. \"I know it, I feel it! He is dead.\" Her  voice, even to herself, sounded hard and strange. She lifted a cold hand  to her eyes, but there were no tears there; and then suddenly she  remembered her guest.    A moment later, Mrs. Jamieson, walking weakly up the steps, met her  coming from the school-room with a glass of water in her hand, which she  proffered silently.    The stranger drank it eagerly. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"It is what I  need. May I come inside for a little?\"    Hilda led the way in silence, and, when her visitor was seated, came and  sat down opposite her. \"Will you tell me what you can?\" she asked  hesitatingly.    \"Willingly. Only it is so little. I have been for some time a guest at  the Glenville House, seeking to recover here in your pure air and  country quiet, from the effects of sorrow and a long illness. I have  driven about these hills and along the lake shore almost daily.\"    \"I have seen you,\" said Hilda, \"as you drove past more than once.\"    \"And did you see me this morning?\"    \"No.\"    \"Still, I passed this spot at eight o'clock; I think, perhaps, earlier.  My physician has cautioned me against long drives, and this morning I  did not go quite so far as usual, because yesterday I went too far. I  had turned my pony toward home just beyond that pretty mill where the  little streams join the lake, and was driving slowly homeward when this  Mr. Doran--is not that right?--this Mr. Doran stopped me to ask if I had  seen a man, a tall, fair man----\"    \"And had you?\"    \"I told him yes; and in a moment some one appeared at the top of the  Indian Mound, and called out that the man was found.\"    \"How--tell me how?\"    Mrs. Jamieson drew back a little and looked into the girl's face with  strange intentness.    \"I--I fear he was a friend of yours,\" she said in a strangely hesitating  manner, her eyes swiftly scanning the pale face.    \"You fear! Why do you fear? Tell me. You say he is injured. Tell me  all--the worst!\"    Still the small, erect, black-clad figure drew back, a look of sudden  understanding and apprehension dawning in her face. She moved her lips,  but no sound came from them.    \"Tell me!\" cried the girl again. \"In mercy--oh, don't you understand?\"    \"Yes, I understand now.\" The lady drew weakly back in the seat and  seemed to be compelling her own eyes and lips to steadiness.    \"Listen! We must be calm--both of us. I--I am not strong; I dare not  give way. Yes, yes; this is all I can tell you. The man, Mr. Doran,  asked me to wait in the road with the pony. He came back soon, and said  that we must find the doctor and the coroner at once; there had been an  accident, and the man--the one for whom they searched--was dead, he  feared.\"    She sprang suddenly to her feet.    \"You must not faint. If you do, I--I cannot help you; I am not strong  enough.\"    \"I shall not faint,\" replied Hilda Grant, in a hard strange voice, and  she, too, arose quickly, and went with straight swift steps through the  open door between the two rooms and out of sight.    Mrs. Jamieson stood looking after her for a moment, as if in doubt and  wonder; then she put up an unsteady hand and drew down the gauze veil  folded back from her close-fitting mourning bonnet.    \"How strange!\" she whispered. \"She turns from me as if--and yet I had to  tell her! Ugh! I cannot stay here alone. I shall break down, too, and I  must not. I must not. Here, and alone!\"    A moment she stood irresolute, then walking slowly she went out of the  school-room, down the stone steps, and through the gate, townward,  slowly at first, and then her pace increasing, and a look of  apprehension growing in her eyes.    \"Oh,\" she murmured as she hurried on, \"what a horrible morning!\" And  then she started hysterically as the shriek of the incoming fast mail  train struck her ears. \"Oh, how nervous this has made me,\" she murmured,  and drew a sigh of relief as she paused unsteadily at the door of her  hotel.    For fully fifteen minutes after Hilda Grant had reached the empty  solitude of her own school-room she stood crouched against the near  wall, her hands clenched and hanging straight at her side, her eyes  fixed on space. Then, with eyes still tearless, but with dry sobs  breaking from her throat, she tottered to her seat before the desk, and  let her face fall forward upon her arms, moaning from time to time like  some hurt animal, and so heedless of all about her that she did not  hear a light step in the hall without, nor the approach of the man who  paused in the doorway to gaze at her in troubled surprise.    He was a tall and slender young fellow, with a handsome face, an eye  clear, frank, and keen, and a mouth which, but for the moustache which  shadowed it, might have been pronounced too strong for beauty.    A moment he stood looking with growing pity upon the grieving woman, and  then he turned and silently tip-toed across the room and to the outer  door. Standing there he seemed to ponder, and then, softly stepping back  to the vacant platform, he seated himself in the teacher's chair and  idly opened the first of the volumes scattered over the desk, smiling as  he read the name, Charles Brierly, written across the fly-leaf.    \"Poor old Charley,\" he said to himself, as he closed the book. \"I wonder  how he enjoys his pedagogic venture, the absurd fellow,\" and then by  some strange instinct he lifted his eyes to the clock on the opposite  wall, and the strangeness of the situation seemed to strike him with  sudden force and brought him to his feet.    What did it mean! This silent school-room! These empty desks and  scattered books! Where were the pupils? the teacher? And why was that  brown-tressed head with its hidden face bowed down in that other room,  in an agony of sorrow?    Half a dozen quick strides brought him again to the door of  communication, and this time his strong, firm footsteps were heard, and  the bowed head lifted itself wearily, and the eyes of the two met, each  questioning the other.    \"I beg your pardon,\" spoke a rich, strong voice. \"May I ask where I  shall find Mr. Brierly?\"    Slowly, as if fascinated, the girl came toward him, a look almost of  terror in her face.    \"Who are you?\" she faltered.    \"I am Robert Brierly. I had hoped to find my brother here at his post.  Will you tell me----\"    But the sudden cry from her lips checked him, and the pent-up tears  burst forth as Hilda Grant, her heart wrung with pity, flung herself  down upon the low platform, and sitting there with her face bent upon  her sleeves, sobbed out her own sorrow in her heartbreak of sympathy for  the grief that must soon overwhelm him and strike the happy light from  his face.    Sobs choked her utterance, and the young man stood near her, uncertain,  anxious, and troubled, until from the direction of the town the sound of  flying wheels smote"]]]
