[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#3)"],[1," there were English theologians who could have set forth  the complete philosophy of the belief, but to the average mind sorcery,  conjuration, enchantment, and witchcraft were but evil ways of mastering  nature. All that was changed when laws were passed. With legislation  came greatly increased numbers of accusations; with accusations and  executions came treatises and theory. Continental writers were  consulted, and the whole system and science of the subject were soon  elaborated for all who read.    With the earlier period, which has been sketched merely by way of  definition, this monograph cannot attempt to deal. It limits itself to a  narrative of the witch trials, and incidentally of opinion as to  witchcraft, after there was definite legislation by Parliament. The  statute of the fifth year of Elizabeth's reign marks a point in the  history of the judicial persecution at which an account may very  naturally begin. The year 1558 has been selected as the date because  from the very opening of the reign which was to be signalized by the  passing of that statute and was to be characterized by a serious effort  to enforce it, the persecution was preparing.    Up to that time the crime of sorcery had been dealt with in a few early  instances by the common-law courts, occasionally (where politics were  involved) by the privy council, but more usually, it is probable, by the  church. This, indeed, may easily be illustrated from the works of law.  Britton and Fleta include an inquiry about sorcerers as one of the  articles of the sheriff's tourn. A note upon Britton, however, declares  that it is for the ecclesiastical court to try such offenders and to  deliver them to be put to death in the king's court, but that the king  himself may proceed against them if he pleases.[5] While there is some  overlapping of procedure implied by this, the confusion seems to have  been yet greater in actual practice. A brief narrative of some cases  prior to 1558 will illustrate the strangely unsettled state of  procedure. Pollock and Maitland relate several trials to be found in the  early pleas. In 1209 one woman accused another of sorcery in the king's  court and the defendant cleared herself by the ordeal. In 1279 a man  accused of killing a witch who assaulted him in his house was fined, but  only because he had fled away. Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and  treasurer of Edward I, was accused of sorcery and homage to Satan and  cleared himself with the compurgators. In 1325 more than twenty men were  indicted and tried by the king's bench for murder by tormenting a waxen  image. All of them were acquitted. In 1371 there was brought before the  king's bench an inhabitant of Southwark who was charged with sorcery,  but he was finally discharged on swearing that he would never be a  sorcerer.[6]    It will be observed that these early cases were all of them tried in the  secular courts; but there is no reason to doubt that the ecclesiastical  courts were quite as active, and their zeal must have been quickened by  the statute of 1401, which in cases of heresy made the lay power their  executioner. It was at nearly the same time, however, that the charge of  sorcery began to be frequently used as a political weapon. In such  cases, of course, the accused was usually a person of influence and the  matter was tried in the council. It will be seen, then, that the crime  was one that might fall either under ecclesiastical or conciliar  jurisdiction and the particular circumstances usually determined finally  the jurisdiction. When Henry IV was informed that the diocese of Lincoln  was full of sorcerers, magicians, enchanters, necromancers, diviners,  and soothsayers, he sent a letter to the bishop requiring him to search  for sorcerers and to commit them to prison after conviction, or even  before, if it should seem expedient.[7] This was entrusting the matter  to the church, but the order was given by authority of the king, not  improbably after the matter had been discussed in the council. In the  reign of Henry VI conciliar and ecclesiastical authorities both took  part at different times and in different ways. Thomas Northfield, a  member of the Order of Preachers in Worcester and a professor of  divinity, was brought before the council, together with all suspected  matter belonging to him, and especially his books treating of sorcery.  Pike does not tell us the outcome.[8] In the same year there were  summoned before the council three humbler sorcerers, Margery Jourdemain,  John Virley, a cleric, and John Ashwell, a friar of the Order of the  Holy Cross. It would be hard to say whether the three were in any way  connected with political intrigue. It is possible that they were  suspected of sorcery against the sovereign. They were all, however,  dismissed on giving security.[9] It was only a few years after this  instance of conciliar jurisdiction that a much more important case was  turned over to the clergy. The story of Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of  Gloucester, is a familiar one. It was determined by the enemies of Duke  Humphrey of Gloucester to attack him through his wife, who was believed  to be influential with the young king. The first move was made by  arresting a Roger Bolingbroke who had been connected with the duke and  the duchess, and who was said to be an astronomer or necromancer. It was  declared that he had cast the duchess's horoscope with a view to  ascertaining her chances to the throne. Bolingbroke made confession, and  Eleanor was then brought before \"certayne bisshoppis of the kyngis.\" In  the mean time several lords, members of the privy council, were  authorized to \"enquire of al maner tresons, sorcery, and alle othir  thyngis that myghte in eny wise ... concerne harmfulli the kyngis  persone.\"[10] Bolingbroke and a clergyman, Thomas Southwell, were  indicted of treason with the duchess as accessory. With them was accused  that Margery Jourdemain who had been released ten years before. Eleanor  was then reexamined before the Bishops of London, Lincoln, and Norwich,  she was condemned as guilty, and required to walk barefoot through the  streets of London, which she \"dede righte mekely.\" The rest of her life  she spent in a northern prison. Bolingbroke was executed as a traitor,  and Margery Jourdemain was burnt at Smithfield.[11]    The case of the Duchess of Bedford--another instance of the connection  between sorcery and political intrigue--fell naturally into the hands of  the council. It was believed by those who could understand in no other  way the king's infatuation that he had been bewitched by the mother of  the queen. The story was whispered from ear to ear until the duchess got  wind of it and complained to the council against her maligners. The  council declared her cleared of suspicion and ordered that the decision  should be \"enacted of record.\"[12]    The charge of sorcery brought by the protector Richard of Gloucester  against Jane Shore, who had been the mistress of Edward IV, never came  to trial and in consequence illustrates neither ecclesiastical nor  conciliar jurisdiction. It is worthy of note however that the accusation  was preferred by the protector--who was soon to be Richard III--in the  council chamber.[13]    It will be seen that these cases prove very little as to procedure in  the matter of sorcery and witchcraft. They are cases that arose in a  disturbed period and that concerned chiefly people of note. That they  were tried before the bishops or before the privy council does not mean  that all such charges were brought into those courts. There must have  been less important cases that were never brought before the council or  the great ecclesiastical courts. It seems probable--to reason backward  from later practice--that less important trials were conducted almost  exclusively by the minor church courts.[14]    This would at first lead us to suspect that, when the state finally  began to legislate against witchcraft by statute, it was endeavoring to  wrest jurisdiction of the crime out of the hands of the church and to  put it into secular hands. Such a supposition, however, there is nothing  to justify. It seems probable, on the contrary, that the statute enacted  in the reign of Henry VIII was passed rather to support the church in  its struggle against sorcery and witchcraft than to limit its  jurisdiction in the matter. It was to assist in checking these  practitioners that the state stepped in. At another point in this  chapter we shall have occasion to note the great interest in sorcery and  all kindred subjects that was springing up over England, and we shall at  times observe some of the manifestations of this interest as well as  some of the causes for it. Here it is necessary only to urge the  importance of this interest as accounting for the passage of a  statute.[15]    Chapter VIII of 33 Henry VIII states its purpose clearly: \"Where,\"  reads the preamble, \"dyvers and sundrie persones unlawfully have devised  and practised Invocacions and conjuracions of Sprites, pretendyng by  suche meanes to understande and get Knowlege for their owne lucre in  what place treasure of golde and Silver shulde or mought be founde or  had ... and also have used and occupied wichecraftes, inchauntmentes and  sorceries to the distruccion of their neighbours persones and goodes.\" A  description was given of the methods practised, and it was enacted that  the use of any invocation or conjuration of spirits, witchcrafts,  enchantments, or sorceries should be considered felony.[16] It will be  observed that the law made no graduation of offences. Everything was  listed as felony. No later piece of legislation on the subject was so  sweeping in its severity.    The law remained on the statute-book only six years. In the early part  of the reign of Edward VI, when the protector Somerset was in power, a  policy of great leniency in respect to felonies was proposed.

These      riffles, because of the influence of the reservoir, are probably      the most permanent in the drainage at present. The slender madtom      may become more widespread if other reservoirs are built that      stabilize stream flow in the basin.        _Perca flavescens_ (Mitchill).

The johnny darter, like the common shiner, has been taken      recently only in Rock Creek, where darters flourish. Often, ten to      fifteen johnny darters were taken with one sweep of a 6- or 12-foot      seine in shallow pools having mud bottoms.

The largemouth bass occurs throughout the drainage at      present, and should become established without supplemental      stocking in future reservoirs. The absence of this species in early      collections suggests that widespread stocking of bass in various      impoundments in the area in recent years has increased populations      in the streams. An anomalous individual, lacking a right pelvic      fin, was found in Lone Star Lake.        _Chaenobryttus gulosus_ (Cuvier). The warmouth is present in Lone      Star Lake.

KU 12.      _Discussion_    Our data show that the present fish-fauna of the Wakarusa River has  three major components:    (1) A group of species that are mainly restricted to the lower  mainstream; all of them are common in the Kansas River (_Lepisosteus  osseus_, _Carpiodes carpio carpio_, _Ictiobus cyprinella_, _Moxostoma  aureolum_, _Cyprinus carpio_, _Hybopsis storeriana_, _Hybopsis  aestivalis_, _Notropis percobromus_, _Hybognathus nuchalis_ and  _Pylodictis olivaris)_.    (2) A group of species that are ubiquitous; they comprised the entire  fauna in some tributaries, despite the existence of habitats that  seemed suitable for other species (_Notropis lutrensis_, _Pimephales  promelas_, _Ictalurus melas_, and _Lepomis cyanellus_).    (3) A group of species having distributions centered in Rock Creek,  Washington Creek, Deer Creek, and some nearby tributaries (_Catostomus  commersonnii_, _Semotilus atromaculatus_, _Hybopsis biguttata_,  _Notropis cornutus_, _Notropis topeka_, _Notropis umbratilis_,  _Phenacobius mirabilis_, _Pimephales notatus_, _Campostoma anomalum_,  _Noturus exilis_, _Percina caprodes_, _Etheostoma nigrum_ and  _Etheostoma spectabile_).    The distributions of groups (2) and (3) provide clues to the effect of  drought on the fish-population, and on the relative ability of various  species to repopulate areas where they have been extirpated.    Larimore _et al._ (1959) studied the re-establishment of stream-fish  following drought in Smiths Branch, a small warmwater stream in  Illinois. They found that 21 of the 29 species regularly occurring  there reinvaded most of the stream-course within two weeks after the  resumption of normal flow, and that all but three species were present  by the end of the first summer. Our study indicates a much slower rate  of dispersal by many of the same species. This is presumably  attributable to the ecological barrier presented by the Wakarusa  mainstream.    During the drought (1952-1956) the mainstream with its turbid water and  mud bottom could hardly have served as a refugium for species requiring  the clear water and gravel bottom of upland tributaries. Probably the  main refugia for these species [group (3)] were in the upper portions  of Rock Creek, Washington Creek and possibly Deer Creek. While  collecting we observed that these creeks had larger proportions of  gravel-rubble bottom, clearer water, deeper pools, and appeared to be  more stable than other creeks in the drainage. In Washington Creek,  Lone Star Lake enhanced stability of flow.    At the end of the drought, fishes in group (3) probably were extirpated  or decimated in other tributaries of the Wakarusa. After normal flow  recommenced in 1956, fishes re-entered the previously uninhabitable  streams or stream-segments. The rate of redispersal by various species  probably depended upon their innate mobility, and upon their tolerance  of the muddy mainstream of the Wakarusa.    Our observations suggest that certain species in group (3) dispersed  rapidly from refugia in Rock Creek, Washington Creek, and possibly Deer  Creek. These species may, of course, have survived in a few remaining  pools in tributaries throughout the basin, thereby necessitating only  minor redispersal within these tributaries following drought.    Species of group (3) that were most tolerant of drought or that  dispersed most rapidly are _Catostomus commersonnii_, _Notropis  umbratilis_, _Pimephales notatus_, and _Percina caprodes_; these were  present in the uppermost portions of the basin in 1959. Fishes having  lesser capacity for survival or dispersal are _Semotilus  atromaculatus_, _Notropis topeka_, _Phenacobius mirabilis_ and  _Campostoma anomalum_; in 1959, they were not found farther upstream  than Burys Creek. _Etheostoma spectabile_, the orangethroat darter, was  taken in Rock Creek, Washington Creek, Deer Creek, Strowbridge Creek,  Elk Creek, and at station 24 on the Wakarusa. This is a  riffle-dwelling, comparatively sedentary fish, not a strong swimmer.  These traits, coupled with the long, muddy pools and infrequent riffles  of the Wakarusa mainstream, provide a reasonable explanation of the  comparatively slow rate of dispersal by the orangethroat darter.    Several species showed no tendency for redispersal following drought,  in that they were confined to Washington Creek or Rock Creek in 1959.  _Noturus exilis_ was taken only in Washington Creek immediately below  Lone Star Lake. Rock Creek is the last stream in the Wakarusa Basin in  which _Notropis cornutus_, _Hybopsis biguttata_ and _Etheostoma nigrum_  have survived. These species require comparatively permanent streams  having pool-and-riffle habitats and gravelly bottoms for spawning.  _Hybopsis biguttata_ has been recorded only from Rock Creek, where it  was last taken in 1924. It is interesting to note that this species had  not reinvaded Smiths Branch, in Illinois, three years after the  resumption of stream-flow (Larimore _et al._, 1959). _Notropis  cornutus_ and _Etheostoma nigrum_, although formerly more widespread in  the Wakarusa Basin, have been taken recently only in Rock Creek.    Faunal changes that have occurred in the basin in the past 60 years  indicate a decrease in extent of clear, continuously flowing  stream-habitat.      _Comparisons with Faunas of Nearby Streams_    Minckley (1959) reported 13 species from the Big Blue River Basin that  were not taken in our survey of the Wakarusa. Most of the 13 are fishes  that probably occur throughout the lower mainstream of the Kansas River  and might enter the lower Wakarusa occasionally. _Chrosomus  erythrogaster_ and _Notropis rubellus_ were reported by Minckley but  have not been found in the Kansas River Basin east of the Flint Hills,  either in recent or in early collections.
