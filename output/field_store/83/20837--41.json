[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#6)"],[1," naval,  air, marine, and other defense or military-type forces.    Military expenditures--dollar figure: This entry gives current  military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by  multiplying the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the  gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.  The figure should be treated with caution because of different price  patterns and accounting methods among nations.    Military expenditures--percent of GDP: This entry gives current  military expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic  product (GDP).    Military manpower--availability: This entry gives the total numbers of  males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit  to serve.    Military manpower--fit for military service: This entry gives the  number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This  is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability  which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and  reduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of  the actual number fit to serve.    Military manpower--military age: This entry gives the minimum age at  which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject  to conscription.    Military manpower--reaching military age annually: This entry gives  the number of draft-age males and females entering the military  manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability  of draft-age young adults.    Military--note: This entry includes miscellaneous military information  of significance not included elsewhere.    Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US  dollars unless otherwise indicated.    National capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of  government.    National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day of  celebration--usually independence day.    Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for  citizens--noun and adjective.    Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,  hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the difference  between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during  the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of  persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,  3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The  net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the  overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause  problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife  (if people are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in  certain key sectors (if people are leaving).    People: This category includes the entries dealing with the  characteristics of the people and their society.    People--note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for  transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum  products.    Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing of  political organizations and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a listing  of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing  for legislative election.    Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the  Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past,  and on assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993  Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)  have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS  infections; in 1997 these countries were Botswana, Brazil, Burkina  Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,  Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zaire which  is now known as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe. The total population presents one overall measure of the  potential impact of the country on the world and within its region.    Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in the  population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over  deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The  rate may be positive or negative. Also known as growth rate or average  annual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor in determining how  rapidly a country responds to the changing needs of its people in  terms of infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads),  resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population  growth can also be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors: This entry lists a few ports and harbors selected  on the basis of overall importance to each country. This is determined  by evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods  handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).    Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total number of AM,  FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.    Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.    Railways: This entry includes the total length of the railway network  and component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and  other.    Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and special or  current interest maps.    Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting  with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each female in  five age groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and  over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently  emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some  countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian  countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide  due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage  patterns and fertility patterns and could cause unrest among young  adult males who are unable to find partners. The sex ratio at birth  for the World is 1.06 (1997 est.).    Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the  right to vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of  the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)  in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not  presented is the international access code which varies from country  to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call  placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where  011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls  (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),  [34] is the country code for Spain,  (1) is the city code for Madrid,  577 is the local exchange, and  xxxx is the local telephone number.    An international direct dial telephone call placed from another  country to the US would be as follows:    An international direct dial telephone call placed from another  country to the US would be as follows:    [1] is the country code for the US,  (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  939 is the local exchange, and  xxxx is the local telephone number.    Telephone system: This entry includes a brief characterization of the  system with details on the domestic and international components. The  following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry:    Arabsat-Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia)    Autodin--Automatic Digital Network (US Department of Defense)    CB--citizen's band mobile radio communications    cellular telephone system--the telephones in this system are radio    transceivers, each instrument having its own private radio frequency  with sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in its  area (cell), from which the telephone signal is fed to a regular  telephone exchange    Central American Microwave System--a trunk microwave radio relay  system that links the countries of Central America and Mexico with  each other    coaxial cable--a multichannel communication cable consisting of a  central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated from a  cylindrical conducting shell; a large number of telephone channels can  be made available within the insulated space by the use of a large  number of carrier frequencies    DSN--Defense Switched Network (formerly Automatic Voice Network or  Autovon); basic general--purpose, switched voice network of the  Defense Communications System (US Department of Defense)    Eutelsat--European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Paris)    fiber-optic cable--a multichannel communications cable using a thread  of optical glass fibers as a transmission medium in which the signal  (voice, video, etc.) is in the form of a coded pulse of light    HF--high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to 30,000-kHz  range    Inmarsat-International Mobile Satellite Organization (London);  provider of global mobile satellite communications for commercial and  distress and safety applications, at sea, in the air, and on land    Intelsat--International Telecommunications Satellite Organization  (Washington, DC)    Intersputnik--International Organization of Space Communications  (Moscow); first established in the former Soviet Union and the East  European countries, it is now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16623"],[0,"Letters of a Woman Homesteader (#6)"],[1,"and herself also. I suppose it seemed  odd to her to be unable to give way to Sedalia as she had always done.    I had cooked and cooked. Gale and Zebulon Pike both helped all they  could. The wedding was to be at twelve o'clock, so at ten I hustled  Gale into my room to dress. I had to lock the door to keep her in, and  I divided my time between the last touches to my dinner and the  finishing touches to Gale's toilet and receiving the people. The Lane  party had not come yet, and I was scared to death lest Sedalia had had  a tantrum and that Mr. Stewart would not get back in time. At last I  left the people to take care of themselves, for I had too much on my  mind to bother with them. Just after eleven Mr. Stewart, Mis' Lane,  Sedalia, and Pa Lane \"arriv\" and came at once into the kitchen to warm.  In a little while poor, frightened Gale came creeping in, looking  guilty. But she looked lovely, too, in spite of her plaid dress. She  wore her hair in a coronet braid, which added dignity and height, as  well as being simple and becoming. Her mother brought her a wreath for  her hair, of lilies of the valley and tiny pink rosebuds. It might seem  a little out of place to one who didn't see it, but the effect was  really charming.    Sedalia didn't know that Mr. Stewart had given Gale her dress, so, just  to be nasty, she said, as soon as she saw Gale, \"Dear me, when are you  going to dress, Gale? You will hardly have time to get out of that  horse-blanket you are wearing and get into something decent.\" You see,  she thought it was one of my dresses fixed over for Gale. Presently  Sedalia asked me if I was invited to the \"function.\" She had some kind  of rash on her face and Zebulon Pike noticed the rash and heard the  word \"function,\" so he thought that was the name of some disease and  asked Mr. Stewart if the \"function\" was \"catching.\" Mr. Stewart had  heard Sedalia, but knew \"Zebbie\" had not heard all that was said and  how he got the idea he had, so he answered, \"Yes, if ye once get the  fever.\" So Zebulon Pike privately warned every one against getting the  \"function\" from Sedalia. There are plenty of people here who don't know  exactly what a function is, myself among them. So people edged away  from Sedalia, and some asked her if she had seen the doctor and what he  thought of her case. Poor girl, I'm afraid she didn't have a very  enjoyable time.    At last the \"jestice\" of the peace came, and I hope they live happy  ever afterward. That night a dance was given to celebrate the event  and we began to have dinner immediately after the wedding so as to get  through in time to start, for dances are never given in the home here,  but in \"the hall.\" Every settlement has one and the invitations are  merely written announcements posted everywhere. We have what Sedalia  calls \"homogenous\" crowds. I wouldn't attempt to say what she means,  but as everybody goes no doubt she is right.    Our dinner was a success, but that is not to be wondered at. Every  woman for miles around contributed. Of course we had to borrow dishes,  but we couldn't think of seating every one; so we set one table for  twenty-four and had three other long tables, on one of which we placed  all the meats, pickles, and sauces, on another the vegetables, soup,  and coffee, and on the third the pie, cakes, ice-cream, and other  desserts. We had two big, long shelves, one above the other, on which  were the dishes. The people helped themselves to dishes and neighbors  took turns at serving from the tables, so people got what they wanted  and hunted themselves a place to sit while they ate. Two of the cowboys  from this ranch waited upon the table at which were the wedding party  and some of their friends. Boys from other ranches helped serve and  carried coffee, cake, and ice-cream. The tablecloths were tolerably  good linen and we had ironed them wet so they looked nice. We had white  lace-paper on the shelves and we used drawn-work paper napkins. As I  said, we borrowed dishes, or, that is, every woman who called herself  our neighbor brought whatever she thought we would need. So after every  one had eaten I suggested that they sort out their dishes and wash  them, and in that way I was saved all that work. We had everything done  and were off to the dance by five o'clock. We went in sleds and  sleighs, the snow was so deep, but it was all so jolly. Zebbie, Mr.  Stewart, Jerrine, and I went in the bobsled. We jogged along at a  comfortable pace lest the \"beasties\" should suffer, and every now and  then a merry party would fly past us scattering snow in our faces and  yelling like Comanches. We had a lovely moon then and the snow was so  beautiful! We were driving northward, and to the south and back of us  were the great somber, pine-clad Uintah Mountains, while ahead and on  every side were the bare buttes, looking like old men of the  mountains,--so old they had lost all their hair, beard, and teeth.          VII    ZEBULON PIKE VISITS HIS OLD HOME           _December 28, 1909._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    Our Thanksgiving affair was the most enjoyable happening I can remember  for a long time. Zebulon Pike came, but I had as a bait for him two fat  letters from home. As soon as I came back from his place I wrote to  Mrs. Carter and trusted to luck for my letter to reach her. I told her  all I could about her brother and how seldom he left his mountain home.  I asked her to write him all she could in one letter, as the trips  between our place and his were so few and far between. So when she  received my letter she wrote all she could think of, and then sent her  letter and mine to Mothie and Phoebe, who are widows living in the  old home. They each took turns writing, so their letters are a complete  record of the years \"Zebbie\" has been gone. The letters were addressed  to me along with a cordial letter from Mrs. Carter asking me to see  that he got them and to use my judgment in the delivering. I couldn't  go myself, but I wanted to read the letters to him and to write the  answers; so I selected one piece of news I felt would bring him to hear  the rest without his knowing how much there was for him.    Well, the boys brought him, and a more delighted little man I am sure  never lived. I read the letters over and over, and answers were hurried  off. He was dreadfully homesick, but couldn't figure on how he could  leave the \"critters,\" or how he could trust himself on a train. Mr.  Stewart became interested, and he is a very resourceful man, so an old  Frenchman was found who had no home and wanted a place to stay so he  could trap. He was installed at Zebulon Pike's with full instructions  as to each \"critter's\" peculiarities and needs. Then one of the boys,  who was going home for Christmas to Memphis, was induced to wait for  Mr. Parker and to see him safe to Little Rock. His money was banked for  him, and Mr. Stewart saw that he was properly clothed and made  comfortable for the trip. Then he sent a telegram to Judge Carter, who  met Zebulon Pike at Little Rock, and they had a family reunion in Yell  County. I have had some charming letters from there, but that only  proves what I have always said, that I am the luckiest woman in finding  really lovely people and having really happy experiences. Good things  are constantly happening to me. I wish I could tell you about my happy  Christmas, but one of my New Year's resolutions was to stop loading you  down with two-thousand-word letters.    From something you wrote I think I must have written boastingly to you  at some time. I have certainly not intended to, and you must please  forgive me and remember how ignorant I am and how hard it is for me to  express myself properly. I felt after I had written to Mr. Parker's  people that I had taken a liberty, but luckily it was not thought of in  that way by them. If you only knew how far short I fall of my own hopes  you would know I could _never_ boast. Why, it keeps me busy making over  mistakes just like some one using old clothes. I get myself all ready  to enjoy a success and find that I have to fit a failure. But one  consolation is that I generally have plenty of material to cut  generously, and many of my failures have proved to be real blessings.    I do hope this New Year may bring to you the desire of your heart and  all that those who love you best most wish for you.    With lots and lots of love from baby and myself.      Your ex-washlady,      ELINORE RUPERT.          VIII    A HAPPY CHRISTMAS      DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    My happy Christmas resulted from the ex-sheriff of this county being  snowbound here. It seems that persons who come from a lower altitude to  this country frequently become bewildered, especially if in poor  health, leave the train at any stop and wander off into the hills,  sometimes dying before they are found. The ex-sheriff cited a case,  that of a young German who was returning from the Philippines, where he  had been discharged after the war. He was the only child of his widowed  mother, who has a ranch a few miles from here. No one knew he was  coming home. One day the cook belonging to the camp of a construction  gang went hunting and came back running, wild with horror. He had found  the body of a man. The coroner and the sheriff were notified, and next  morning went out for the body, but the wolves had almost destroyed it.  High up in a willow, under which the poor man had lain down to die,  they saw a small bundle tied in a red bandanna and fast to a branch.  They found a letter addressed to whoever should find it, saying that  the body was that of Benny Louderer and giving them directions how to  spare his poor old mother the awful knowledge of how he died. Also  there was a letter to his mother asking her not to grieve for him and  to keep their days faithfully. \"Their days,\" I afterward learned, were  anniversaries which they had always kept, to which was added \"Benny's  day.\"    Poor boy!"]]]
