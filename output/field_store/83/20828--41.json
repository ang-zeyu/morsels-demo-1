[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#6)"],[1,"two ages; and Digby, with one hand in Lilly's and the other in  Bacon's, joins the mediaeval to the modern world. Nor is a universal amateur  a genius who has squandered his powers; but a man exercising his many  talents in the only way possible to himself, and generally with much  entertainment and stimulus to others. It was Ben Jonson, too great a man to  be one of his detractors on this score, who wrote of him:        \"He is built like some imperial room      For that[1] to dwell in, and be still at home.      His breast is a brave palace, a broad street,      Where all heroic ample thoughts do meet;      Where nature such a large survey hath ta'en      As other souls to his, dwelt in a lane.\"    [Footnote 1: All virtue.]    There was nothing singular in his interest in astrology and alchemy. Lilly  and Booker, both of them among his acquaintances, were ordered to attend  the parliamentary army at the siege of Colchester, \"to encourage the  soldiers with predictions of speedy victory.\" Still--though he believed in  greater absurdities--his attitude towards such matters was that of his  chosen motto, _Vacate et Videte._ \"To rely too far upon that vaine art I  judge to be rather folly than impiety.\" As with regard to spirits and  witches, he says, \"I only reserve my assent.\" That he was not altogether  absorbed in the transmutation of metals in his laboratory practice, and yet  that he dabbled in it, makes him historically interesting. In him better  than in Newton do we realise the temper of the early members of the Royal  Society. In this tale of his other activities I have not forgotten _The  Closet Opened_. Of all Digby's many interests the most constant and  permanent was medicine. How to enlarge the span of man's life was a problem  much meditated on in his age. We have seen how Descartes's mind ran on it;  and in Bacon's _Natural History_ there is reference to a 'book of the  prolongation of life.' In spite of what is written on his Janssen hermit  portrait--_Saber morir la mayor hazanza_--Digby loved life. His whole  exuberant career is a paean to life, for itself and its great chances, and  because \"it giveth the leave to vent and boyle away the unquietnesses and  turbulences that follow our passions.\" To prolong life, fortify it, clarify  it, was a noble pursuit, and he set out on it as a youth under the tuition  of the 'good parson of Lindford. His _Physick and Chirurgery_ receipts,  published by Hartman, are many of them incredible absurdities, not  unfrequently repulsive; but when we compare them with other like books of  the time, they fit into a natural and not too fantastic place. Sir Thomas  Browne was laughing at Digby, but not at Digby alone, in the passage in  _Vulgar Errors_--\"when for our warts we rub our hands before the moon, or  commit any maculated part unto the touch of the dead.\" Sir Kenelm gathered  his receipts on all his roads through Europe, noted them down, made them up  with his own hands, and administered them to his friends. In Hartman's  _Family Physician_ is given \"An experienced Remedy against the Falling  Sicknes, wherewith Sir K. Digby cur'd a Minister's Son at Franckfort in  Germany, in the year 1659.\" It begins, \"Take the Skull of a Man that died  of a Violent Death.\" (Hartman says he helped to prepare the ghastly  concoction.) I have already noted how he doctored his beautiful wife's  complexion; and how he was called in to cure Howell's wound. In a poetic  tribute he is referred to as:        \"Hee, that all med'cines can exactly make,      And freely give them.\"    Evelyn records how Digby \"advised me to try and digest a little better, and  gave me a water which he said was only raine water of the autumnal equinox  exceedingly rectified, and smelt like _aqua fortis_.\"    Here, at last, we have come to the end of Sir Kenelm the amateur. If he was  an empiric, so were all the doctors of his time; and he may be described as  a professional unpaid physician who carried on a frequently interrupted  practice. That he did not publish his receipts himself does not reflect on  his own idea of their importance. They had a wide circulation among his  friends. And, as I have pointed out, he never showed great eagerness to  publish. Such works as appeared in his lifetime were evidently printed at  the request of learned societies, or by friends to whom they were  dedicated, or by White.    The distance between the healer and the cook has grown to be immense in  recent times. The College of Physicians and Mary Jane in the kitchen are  not on nodding terms--though one sees faint signs of an effort to bridge  the wide gap. But in the seventeenth century the gap can hardly be said to  have existed at all. At the back of the doctor is plainly seen the figure  of the herbalist and simpler, who appear again prominently in the  still-room and the kitchen, by the side of great ladies and great  gentlemen, bent on making the best and the most of the pleasures of the  table no doubt, but quite as much on the maintenance of health as of  hospitality. Simpler, herbalist, doctor, distiller, cook--Digby was all of  them, and all of them with the utmost seriousness; nor in this was he in  the least singular. The great Bacon was deeply concerned with such cares,  though in certain of his recommendations, such as: \"To provide always an  apt break-fast,\" to take this every morning, not to forget to take that  twice a month, one may read more of the valetudinarian than in Digby. _The  Closet Opened_ is but one of an interesting series of books of the kind,  which have been too much neglected by students of seventeenth-century  manners and lore and language. Did not W.J. issue the Countess of Kent's  _Choice Manual of Physic and Chirurgey_, with directions for Preserving and  Candying? Patrick, Lord Ruthven's _Ladies' Cabinet Opened_ appeared in 1639  and 1655. Nor was it only the _cuisine_ of the nobles that roused interest.  One of the curiosities of the time is _The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth,  commonly called Joan Cromwell, the Wife of the Late Usurper Truly Described  and Represented and now made Publick for general Satisfaction,_ 1644. The  preface is scurrilous beyond belief. Compiled from the gossip of servants,  it is meant to cast ridicule on the housekeeping of the Protector's  establishment. But the second part is a sober collection of by no means  very penurious recipes from Joan's own kitchen books.    Hartman, his steward, made an excellent thing out of Digby's  receipts--though the publishing of _The Closet Opened_ was not his doing,  I think. His _Choice and Experimented Receipts in Physick and Chirurgery_  had already appeared in 1668, which suggested to some other hanger-on of  the Digby household that John Digby's consent might be obtained for  printing Sir Kenelm's culinary as well as his medical note-books. Hartman  followed up this new track with persistence and profit to himself. As a  mild example of the \"choice and experimented,\" I transcribe \"An Approved  Remedy for Biting of a Mad Dog\": \"Take a quart of Ale, and a dram of  Treacle, a handful of Rue, a spoonful of shavings or filings of Tin. Boil  all these together, till half be consumed. Take of this two spoonfuls in  the morning, and at night cold. It is excellent for Man or Beast.\" I need  not continue. The receipts are there for curious searchers. They were  applied to aristocratic patients; and they are no more absurd or loathsome  than those of other books of the time and kind. Even Bacon is fantastic  enough with his \"Grains of Youth\" and \"Methusalem Water.\" In 1682, George  Hartman published, \"for the Publike Good,\" _The True Preserver and Restorer  of Health_. It is dedicated to the Countess of Sunderland, and is described  as \"the collection for the most part (which I had hitherto reserved) of  your incomparable kinsman and my truly Honourable Master, Sir Kenelm Digby,  whom I had the Honour to serve for many years beyond the Seas, as well as  in England; and so continued with him till his dying Day, and of whose  Generosity and Bounty I have sufficiently tasted, and no less of your  illustrious Fathers, both before and after my Glorious Masters Decease.\"  Of this book he says, \"The world hath not yet seen such another Piece.\"  Commend me to the forthright methods of seventeenth century advertisement!  In the second part, \"Excellent Directions for Cookery,\" _The Closet Opened_  was largely drawn on. In 1696 appeared _The Family Physician_, by George  Hartman, Phylo-Chymist ... who liv'd and Travell'd with the Honourable Sir  Kenelm Digby in several parts of Europe, the space of Seven Years till he  died. This other choice compilation owes much to the \"incomparable\" one,  and is described as \"the marrow of collections.\"    But Hartman is not the only witness to Digby's connoisseurship in the joint  mysteries. Better to my mind than even Hartman's are the style and the  spirit of Master May. In 1660 appeared _The Accomplisht Cook,_ or the Art  and Mystery of Cookery ... approved by the fifty years experience and  industry of Robert May, in his attendance on Several Persons of Honour. It  is dedicated to Lord Lumley, Lord Lovelace, Sir Wm. Paston, Sir Kenelme  Digby, and Sir Frederick Cornwallis, \"so well known to the Nation for their  admired Hospitalities,\" and generally to                              \"the race      Of those that for the Gusto stand,      Whose tables a whole Ark command      Of Nature's plentie.\"    \"He is an Alien, a meer Stranger in England that hath not been acquainted  with your generous housekeeping; for my own part, my more particular Tyes  of Service to you, my Honoured Lords, have built me up to the height of  this experience.\" His preface is a heartrending cry of regret for the good  old times before usurping Parliaments banished splendidly extravagant  gentlemen across the seas, \"those golden days of Peace and Hospitality,  when you enjoy'd your own, so as to entertain and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],[0,"Indian Unrest (#6)"],[1," we analyse it with care, when we study it in     the light of common human psychology, when we study     it in the light of our past experience of the racial characteristics     of the British people, when we study it in the light of past     British history in India and other parts of the world, when     we study and analyse this ideal of self-government within     the Empire, we find it is a far more impracticable thing to     attain than even our ideal _Swaraj_.    I have quoted Mr. Pal's utterances at some length, because they are the  fullest and the most frank exposition available of what lies beneath the  claim to Colonial self-government as it is understood by \"advanced\"  politicians. No one can deny the merciless logic with which he analyses  the inevitable results of _Swaraj_, and Englishmen may well be grateful  to him for having disclosed them so fearlessly. British sympathizers who  are reluctant to look behind a formula which commends itself to their  peculiar predilections, naturally dislike any reference to Mr. Pal's  interpretation of Indian \"self-government,\" and would even impugn his  character in order the better to question his authority. But they cannot  get over the fact that in India, very few \"moderate\" politicians have  had the courage openly to repudiate his programmes, though many of them  realize its dangers, whilst the \"extremists\" want a much shorter cut to  the same goal. It is only by pledging itself to _Swaraj_ that the Indian  National Congress has been able to maintain a semblance of unity.    Moreover, if any doubt still lingers as to the inner meaning of _Swaraj_  and _Swadeshi_, and other kindred war-cries of Indian Nationalism, the  language of the Nationalist Press remains on record to complete our  enlightenment. However incompatible with the maintenance of British rule  may be the propositions set forth by Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, they contain  no incitement to violence, no virulent diatribes against Englishmen. It  is in the Press rather than on the platform that Indian politicians,  whether \"extreme\" or merely \"advanced\" are apt to let themselves go.  They write down to the level of their larger audiences. So little has  hitherto been done to enlighten public opinion at home as to the gravity  of the evil which the recent Indian Press law has at last, though very  tardily, done something to repress that many Englishmen are still  apparently disposed to regard that measure as an oppressive, or at least  dubious, concession to bureaucratic impatience of criticism none the  less healthy for being sometimes excessive.[1] The following quotations,  taken from vernacular papers before the new Press law was enacted, will  serve to show what Lord Morley meant when he said, \"You may put picric  acid in the ink and the pen just as much as in any steel bomb,\" and  again, \"It is said that these incendiary articles are 'mere froth.' Yes,  they are froth, but froth stained with bloodshed.\" Even when they  contain no definite incitement to murder, no direct exhortation to  revolt, they will show how systematically, how persistently the wells of  Indian public opinion have been poisoned for years past by those who  claim to represent the intelligence and enlightenment of modern India.  Only too graphically also do they illustrate one of the most  unpleasantly characteristic features of the literature of Indian  unrest--namely, its insidious appeals to the Hindu Scriptures and the  Hindu deities, and its deliberate vilification of everything English.  Calumny and abuse, combined with a wealth of sacred imagery, supply the  place of any serious process of reasoning such as is displayed in Mr.  Pal's programme with all its uncompromising hostility.    In the first place, a few specimens of the hatred which animates the  champions of _Swaraj_--of Indian independence, or, at least, of Colonial  self-government. The _Hind Swarajya_ is nothing if not plain-spoken:--       Englishmen! Who are Englishmen? They are the present     rulers of this country. But how did they become     our rulers? By throwing the noose of dependence round our     necks, by making us forget our old learning, by leading us     along the path of sin, by keeping us ignorant of the use of     arms.... Oh! my simple countrymen! By their     teaching adultery has entered our homes, and women have     begun to be led astray.... Alas! Has India's golden     land lost all her heroes? Are all eunuchs, timid and afraid,     forgetful of their duty, preferring to die a slow death of torture,     silent witnesses of the ruin of their country? Oh!     Indians, descended from a race of heroes! Why are you afraid     of Englishmen? They are not gods, but men like yourselves,     or, rather, monsters who have ravished your Sita-like beauty     [Sita, the spouse of Rama, was abducted by the demon     Ravana, and recovered with the help of the Monkey God     Hanuman and his army of monkeys]. If there be any Rama     amongst you, let him go forth to bring back your Sita. Raise     the banner of Swadesh, crying Victory to the Mother! Rescue     the truth and accomplish the good of India.    The Calcutta _Yugantar_ argues that \"sedition has no meaning from the  Indian standpoint.\"       If the whole nation is inspired to throw off its yoke and     become independent, then in the eye of God and the eye of     Justice whose claim is more reasonable, the Indian's or the     Englishman's? The Indian has come to see that independence     is the panacea for all his evils. He will therefore even     swim in a sea of blood to reach his goal. The British     dominion over India is a gross myth. It is because the Indian     holds this myth in his bosom that his sufferings are so great     to-day. Long ago the Indian Rishis [inspired sages] preached     the destruction of falsehood and the triumph of truth. And     this foreign rule based on injustice is a gross falsehood. It     must be subverted and true _Swadeshi_ rule established. May     truth be victorious!    The _Gujarat_ hails the Hindu New Year which is coming \"to take away the  curse of the foreigners\":--       Oh noble land of the Aryas, thou who wert so great art like     a caged bird. Are thy powerful sons, Truth and Love, dead?     Has thy daughter Lakshmi plunged into the sea? or art     thou overwhelmed with grief because rogues and demons     have plundered thee? [\"Demons\" is the term usually affected     by Nationalist journalists when they refer to Englishmen.]    The _Shakti_ declares that:--       By whatever names--anarchists, extremists, or seditionists     --those may be called who are taking part in the movement     for independence, whatever efforts may be made to humiliate     and to crush them, however many patriots may be sent to     jail, or into exile, yet the spirit pervading the whole atmosphere     will never be checked, for the spirit is so strong and spontaneous     that it must clearly be directed by Divine Providence.    The following appears In the _Kal_ (Poona):--       We Aryans are no sheep. We have our own country, our     religion, our heroes, our statesmen, our soldiers. We do     not owe them to contact with the English. These things     are not new to us. When the ancestors of those who boast     to-day of their enterprise and their civilization were in a     disgusting state of barbarism, or rather centuries before then,     we were in full possession of all the ennobling qualities of     head and heart. This holy and hoary land of ours will surely     regain her position and be once more by her intrinsic lustre     the home of wealth, arts, and peace. A holy inspiration     is spreading, that people must sacrifice their lives in the     cause of what has once been determined to be their duty.     Heroes are springing up in our midst, though brutal imprisonment     reduce them to skeletons. Let us devote ourselves     to the service of the Mother. A man maddened by     devotion will do everything and anything to achieve his     ideal. His strength will be adamantine. Just as a widow     immolates herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, let     us die for the Mother.    The _Dharma_ (Calcutta) emphasizes specially the religious side of the  movement:--       We are engaged in preaching religion and we are putting     our energy into this agitation, looking on it as the principal     part of our religion.... The present agitation, in its     initial stages, had a strong leaven of the spirit of Western     politics in it, but at present a clear consciousness of Aryan     greatness and a strong love and reverential spirit towards     the Motherland have transformed it into a shape in which     the religious element predominates. Politics is part of religion,     but it has to be cultivated in an Aryan way, in accordance     with the precepts of Aryan religion.    Nowhere is the cult of the \"terrible goddess,\" worshipped under many  forms, but chiefly under those of Kali and Durga, more closely  associated with Indian unrest than in Bengal. Hence the frequency of the  appeals to her in the Bengal Press. The _Dacca Gazette_ welcomes the  festival of Durga with the following outburst:--       Indian brothers! There is no more time for lying asleep.     Behold, the Mother is coming. Oh Mother, the giver of all     good! Turn your eyes upon your degraded children. Mother,     they are now stricken with disease and sorrow. Oh Shyama,     the reliever of the three kinds of human afflictions, relieve     our sorrows. Come Mother, the destroyer of the demons,     and appear at the gates of Bengal.    The Barisal _Hitaishi_ refers also to the Durga festival, in which the  weird and often horrible and obscene rites of _Skakti_ worship not  infrequently play a conspicuous part:--       What have we learnt from the _Shakti Puja_? Sooner or     later this great _Puja_ will yield the desired results. When the     Hindus realize the true magnificence of the"]]]
