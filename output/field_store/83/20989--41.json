Thus may the Sun of Reality shine upon the east and west. The  enveloping clouds shall pass away and the heat of the divine rays will  dispel the mist. The reality of man shall develop and come forth as the  image of God his creator. The thoughts of man shall take such upward  flight that former accomplishments shall appear as the play of  children;--for the ideas and beliefs of the past and the prejudices  regarding race and religion have ever been lowering and destructive to  human evolution. I am most hopeful that in this century these lofty  thoughts shall be conducive to human welfare. Let this century be the sun  of previous centuries the effulgences of which shall last forever, so that  in times to come they shall glorify the twentieth century, saying the  twentieth century was the century of lights, the twentieth century was the  century of life, the twentieth century was the century of international  peace, the twentieth century was the century of divine bestowals and the  twentieth century has left traces which shall last forever.          MAN AND NATURE      From the time of the creation of Adam to this day there have been two  pathways in the world of humanity; one the natural or materialistic, the  other the religious or spiritual. The pathway of nature is the pathway of  the animal realm. The animal acts in accordance with the requirements of  nature, follows its own instincts and desires. Whatever its impulses and  proclivities may be it has the liberty to gratify them; yet it is a  captive of nature. It cannot deviate in the least degree from the road  nature has established. It is utterly minus spiritual susceptibilities,  ignorant of divine religion and without knowledge of the kingdom of God.  The animal possesses no power of ideation or conscious intelligence; it is  a captive of the senses and deprived of that which lies beyond them. It is  subject to what the eye sees, the ear hears, the nostrils sense, the taste  detects and touch reveals. These sensations are acceptable and sufficient  for the animal. But that which is beyond the range of the senses, that  realm of phenomena through which the conscious pathway to the kingdom of  God leads, the world of spiritual susceptibilities and divine religion,--of  these the animal is completely unaware, for in its highest station it is a  captive of nature.    One of the strangest things witnessed is that the materialists of today  are proud of their natural instincts and bondage. They state that nothing  is entitled to belief and acceptance except that which is sensible or  tangible. By their own statements they are captives of nature, unconscious  of the spiritual world, uninformed of the divine Kingdom and unaware of  heavenly bestowals. If this be a virtue the animal has attained it to a  superlative degree, for the animal is absolutely ignorant of the realm of  spirit and out of touch with the inner world of conscious realization. The  animal would agree with the materialist in denying the existence of that  which transcends the senses. If we admit that being limited to the plane  of the senses is a virtue the animal is indeed more virtuous than man, for  it is entirely bereft of that which lies beyond, absolutely oblivious of  the kingdom of God and its traces whereas God has deposited within the  human creature an illimitable power by which he can rule the world of  nature.    Consider how all other phenomenal existence and beings are captives of  nature. The sun, that colossal center of our solar system, the giant stars  and planets, the towering mountains, the earth itself and its kingdoms of  life lower than the human,--all are captives of nature except man. No other  created thing can deviate in the slightest degree from obedience to  natural law. The sun in its glory and greatness millions of miles away is  held prisoner in its orbit of universal revolution, captive of universal  natural control. Man is the ruler of nature. According to natural law and  limitation he should remain upon the earth, but behold how he violates  this command and soars above the mountains in aeroplanes. He sails in  ships upon the surface of the ocean and dives into its depths in  submarines. Man makes nature his servant; harnesses the mighty energy of  electricity for instance and imprisons it in a small lamp for his uses and  convenience. He speaks from the east to the west through a wire. He is  able to store and preserve his voice in a phonograph. Though he is a  dweller upon earth he penetrates the mysteries of starry worlds  inconceivably distant. He discovers latent realities within the bosom of  the earth, uncovers treasures, penetrates secrets and mysteries of the  phenomenal world and brings to light that which according to nature's  jealous laws should remain hidden, unknown and unfathomable. Through an  ideal inner power man brings these realities forth from the invisible  plane to the visible. This is contrary to nature's law.    It is evident therefore that man is ruler over nature's sphere and  province. Nature is inert, man is progressive. Nature has no  consciousness, man is endowed with it. Nature is without volition and acts  perforce whereas man possesses a mighty will. Nature is incapable of  discovering mysteries or realities whereas man is especially fitted to do  so. Nature is not in touch with the realm of God, man is attuned to its  evidences. Nature is uninformed of God, man is conscious of Him. Man  acquires divine virtues, nature is denied them. Man can voluntarily  discontinue vices, nature has no power to modify the influence of its  instincts. Altogether it is evident that man is more noble and superior;  that in him there is an ideal power surpassing nature. He has  consciousness, volition, memory, intelligent power, divine attributes and  virtues of which nature is completely deprived, bereft and minus;  therefore man is higher and nobler by reason of the ideal and heavenly  force latent and manifest in him.    How strange then it seems that man, notwithstanding his endowment with  this ideal power, will descend to a level beneath him and declare himself  no greater than that which is manifestly inferior to his real station. God  has created such a conscious spirit within him that he is the most  wonderful of all contingent beings. In ignoring these virtues he descends  to the material plane, considers matter the ruler of existence and denies  that which lies beyond. Is this virtue? In its fullest sense this is  animalistic, for the animal realizes nothing more. In fact from this  standpoint the animal is the greater philosopher because it is completely  ignorant of the kingdom of God, possesses no spiritual susceptibilities  and is uninformed of the heavenly world. In brief, this is a view of the  pathway of nature.    The second pathway is that of religion, the road of the divine Kingdom. It  involves the acquisition of praiseworthy attributes, heavenly illumination  and righteous actions in the world of humanity. This pathway is conducive  to the progress and uplift of the world. It is the source of human  enlightenment, training and ethical improvement; the magnet which attracts  the love of God because of the knowledge of God it bestows. This is the  road of the holy Manifestations of God for they are in reality the  foundation of the divine religion of oneness. There is no change or  transformation in this pathway. It is the cause of human betterment, the  acquisition of heavenly virtues and the illumination of mankind.    Alas! that humanity is completely submerged in imitations and unrealities  notwithstanding the truth of divine religion has ever remained the same.  Superstitions have obscured the fundamental reality, the world is darkened  and the light of religion is not apparent. This darkness is conducive to  differences and dissensions; rites and dogmas are many and various;  therefore discord has arisen among the religious systems whereas religion  is for the unification of mankind. True religion is the source of love and  agreement amongst men, the cause of the development of praiseworthy  qualities; but the people are holding to the counterfeit and imitation,  negligent of the reality which unifies; so they are bereft and deprived of  the radiance of religion. They follow superstitions inherited from their  fathers and ancestors. To such an extent has this prevailed that they have  taken away the heavenly light of divine truth and sit in the darkness of  imitations and imaginations. That which was meant to be conducive to life  has become the cause of death; that which should have been an evidence of  knowledge is now a proof of ignorance; that which was a factor in the  sublimity of human nature has proved to be its degradation. Therefore the  realm of the religionist has gradually narrowed and darkened and the  sphere of the materialist has widened and advanced; for the religionist  has held to imitation and counterfeit, neglecting and discarding holiness  and the sacred reality of religion. When the sun sets it is the time for  bats to fly. They come forth because they are creatures of the night. When  the lights of religion become darkened the materialists appear. They are  the bats of night. The decline of religion is their time of activity; they  seek the shadows when the world is darkened and clouds have spread over  it.    His Holiness Baha'u'llah has risen from the eastern horizon. Like the  glory of the sun He has come into the world. He has reflected the reality  of divine religion, dispelled the darkness of imitations, laid the  foundation of new teachings and resuscitated the world.    The first teaching of Baha'u'llah is the investigation of reality. Man  must seek the reality himself, forsaking imitations and adherence to mere  hereditary forms.

O my God! Thou seest me detached from all save Thee, holding fast unto  Thee and turning unto the ocean of Thy bounty, to the heaven of Thy favor,  to the Daystar of Thy grace.    Lord! I bear witness that in Thy servant Thou hast reposed Thy Trust, and  that is the Spirit wherewith Thou hast given life to the world.    I ask of Thee by the splendor of the Orb of Thy Revelation, mercifully to  accept from him that which he hath achieved in Thy days. Grant then that  he may be invested with the glory of Thy good-pleasure and adorned with  Thine acceptance.    O my Lord! I myself and all created things bear witness unto Thy might,  and I pray Thee not to turn away from Thyself this spirit that hath  ascended unto Thee, unto Thy heavenly place, Thine exalted Paradise and  Thy retreats of nearness, O Thou who art the Lord of all men!    Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant may consort with Thy chosen ones,  Thy saints and Thy Messengers in heavenly places that the pen cannot tell  nor the tongue recount.    O my Lord, the poor one hath verily hastened unto the Kingdom of Thy  wealth, the stranger unto his home within Thy precincts, he that is sore  athirst to the heavenly river of Thy bounty. Deprive him not, O Lord, from  his share of the banquet of Thy grace and from the favor of Thy bounty.  Thou art in truth the Almighty, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful.    O my God, Thy Trust hath been returned unto Thee. It behooveth Thy grace  and Thy bounty that have compassed Thy dominions on earth and in heaven,  to vouchsafe unto Thy newly welcomed one Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, and  the fruits of the tree of Thy grace! Powerful art Thou to do as Thou  willest, there is none other God but Thee, the Gracious, the Most  Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Pardoner, the Precious,  the All-Knowing.    I testify, O my Lord, that Thou hast enjoined upon men to honor their  guest, and he that hath ascended unto Thee hath verily reached Thee and  attained Thy Presence. Deal with him then according to Thy grace and  bounty! By Thy glory, I know of a certainty that Thou wilt not withhold  Thyself from that which Thou hast commanded Thy servants, nor wilt Thou  deprive him that hath clung to the cord of Thy bounty and hath ascended to  the Dayspring of Thy wealth.    There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the  Omniscient, the Bountiful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower...\"      O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower of gifts, dispeller of  afflictions!    Verily, I beseech Thee to forgive the sins of such as have abandoned the  physical garment and have ascended to the spiritual world.    O my Lord! Purify them from trespasses, dispel their sorrows, and change  their darkness into light. Cause them to enter the garden of happiness,  cleanse them with the most pure water, and grant them to behold Thy  splendors on the loftiest mount.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my God! O my God! Verily, Thy servant,...\"      O my God! O my God! Verily, Thy servant, humble before the majesty of Thy  divine supremacy, lowly at the door of Thy oneness, hath believed in Thee  and in Thy verses, hath testified to Thy word, hath been enkindled with  the fire of Thy love, hath been immersed in the depths of the ocean of Thy  knowledge, hath been attracted by Thy breezes, hath relied upon Thee, hath  turned his face unto Thee, hath offered his supplications to Thee, and  hath been assured of Thy pardon and forgiveness. He hath abandoned this  mortal life and hath flown to the kingdom of immortality, yearning for the  favor of meeting Thee.    O Lord, glorify his station, shelter him under the pavilion of Thy supreme  mercy, cause him to enter Thy glorious paradise, and perpetuate his  existence in Thine exalted rose garden, that he may plunge into the sea of  light in the world of mysteries.    Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Powerful, the Forgiver and the  Bestower.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou forgiving Lord! Although some souls have...\"      O Thou forgiving Lord!    Although some souls have spent the days of their lives in ignorance, and  became estranged and contumacious, yet, with one wave from the ocean of  Thy forgiveness, all those encompassed by sin will be set free. Whomsoever  Thou willest Thou makes a confidant, and whosoever is not the object of  Thy choice is accounted a transgressor. Shouldst Thou deal with us with  Thy justice, we are all naught but sinners and deserving to be shut out  from Thee, but shouldst Thou uphold mercy, every sinner would be made pure  and every stranger a friend. Bestow, then, Thy forgiveness and pardon, and  grant Thy mercy unto all.    Thou art the Forgiver, the Lightgiver and the Omnipotent    --'Abdu'l-Baha          DETACHMENT        \"Suffer me, O my God, to draw nigh unto Thee,...\"      Suffer me, O my God, to draw nigh unto Thee, and to abide within the  precincts of Thy court, for remoteness from Thee hath well-nigh consumed  me. Cause me to rest under the shadow of the wings of Thy grace, for the  flame of my separation from Thee hath melted my heart within me. Draw me  nearer unto the river that is life indeed, for my soul burneth with thirst  in its ceaseless search after Thee. My sighs, O my God, proclaim the  bitterness of mine anguish, and the tears I shed attest my love for Thee.    I beseech Thee, by the praise wherewith Thou praisest Thyself and the  glory wherewith Thou glorifiest Thine own Essence, to grant that we may be  numbered among them that have recognized Thee and acknowledged Thy  sovereignty in Thy days. Help us then to quaff, O my God, from the fingers  of mercy the living waters of Thy loving-kindness, that we may utterly  forget all else except Thee, and be occupied only with Thy Self. Powerful  art Thou to do what Thou willest. No God is there beside Thee, the Mighty,  the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    Glorified be Thy name, O Thou Who art the King of all Kings!    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glorified art Thou, O my God! I yield Thee...\"      Glorified art Thou, O my God! I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast made  known unto me Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy mercy, and the Dawning-Place  of Thy grace, and the Repository of Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy Name,  through which the faces of them that are nigh unto Thee have turned white,  and the hearts of such as are devoted to Thee have winged their flight  towards Thee, to grant that I may, at all times and under all conditions,  lay hold on Thy cord, and be rid of all attachment to anyone except Thee,  and may keep mine eyes directed towards the horizon of Thy Revelation, and  may carry out what Thou hast prescribed unto me in Thy Tablets.    Attire, O my Lord, both my inner and outer being with the raiment of Thy  favors and Thy loving-kindness. Keep me safe, then, from whatsoever may be  abhorrent unto Thee, and graciously assist me and my kindred to obey Thee,  and to shun whatsoever may stir up any evil or corrupt desire within me.    Thou, truly, art the Lord of all mankind, and the Possessor of this world  and of the next. No God is there save Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I entreat Thee...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I entreat Thee by the fragrances of the  Raiment of Thy grace which at Thy bidding and in conformity with Thy  desire were diffused throughout the entire creation, and by the Daystar of  Thy will that hath shone brightly, through the power of Thy might and of  Thy sovereignty, above the horizon of Thy mercy, to blot out from my heart  all idle fancies and vain imaginings, that with all my affections I may  turn unto Thee, O Thou Lord of all mankind!    I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, O my God! I have laid hold on  the handle of Thy grace, and clung to the cord of Thy tender mercy. Ordain  for me the good things that are with Thee, and nourish me from the Table  Thou didst send down out of the clouds of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy  favor.    Thou, in very truth, art the Lord of the worlds, and the God of all that  are in heaven and all that are on earth.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been...\"      Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been set ablaze with the fire of Thy  Cause, and many a slumberer hath been wakened by the sweetness of Thy  voice. How many are the strangers who have sought shelter beneath the  shadow of the tree of Thy oneness, and how numerous the thirsty ones who  have panted after the fountain of Thy living waters in Thy days!    Blessed is he that hath set himself towards Thee, and hasted to attain the  Dayspring of the lights of Thy face. Blessed is he who with all his  affections hath turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the  Fountainhead of Thine inspiration. Blessed is he that hath expended in Thy  path what Thou didst bestow upon him through Thy bounty and favor. Blessed  is he who, in his sore longing after Thee, hath cast away all else except  Thyself. Blessed is he who hath enjoyed intimate communion with Thee, and  rid himself of all attachment to anyone save Thee.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Him Who is Thy Name, Who, through the power  of Thy sovereignty and might, hath risen above the horizon of His prison,  to ordain for everyone what becometh Thee and beseemeth Thine exaltation.    Thy might, in truth, is equal to all things.    --Baha'u'llah        \"I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which...\"      I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which Thou didst kindle in Thy  land. Earth can never cloud its splendor, nor water quench its flame. All  the peoples of the world are powerless to resist its force. Great is the  blessedness of him that hath drawn nigh"]]]
