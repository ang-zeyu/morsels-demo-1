I  fear I had infused my words with an ardor which exhibited at an  earlier and more opportune moment might have changed the course of  both our lives.    \"Of course I know, Jack,\" she said. \"But I am so frightened that I  distrust my very self. Well, then, I thought that I noticed a change  in Eric's manner last night--in the tone of his voice. In fact I asked  him if I had done anything of which he had disapproved.\" She gave me a  quick little embarrassed glance. \"He is somewhat exacting, you know.  He laughed at the idea, but in rather a forced way, it seemed. Then he  arranged to meet me for lunch at the Carlton to-day.\"    \"But surely he can satisfactorily account for his movements? He must  have been seen by those who know him.\"    Isobel frowned in a troubled manner that awakened strange, wild  longings.    \"I cannot make it out,\" she replied. \"He appears to be keeping  something back.\"    \"He is very ill-advised. He will certainly have to make up his mind to  speak out when Inspector Gatton examines him. I cannot disguise from  you, Isobel, that the police know that Sir Marcus was at the New  Avenue last night, and since his death occurred some hours later the  nature of their suspicion is obvious enough. Are you joining him at  the solicitors', Isobel?\"    \"Yes, he asked me to do so.\"    \"Then come along at once. I expect a Scotland Yard man to arrive at  any moment and it would be advisable to see Coverly and to take a  legal opinion before you give your testimony.\"    \"But, Jack!\" Isobel confronted me. \"You don't think that I or Eric  have anything to hide?\"    \"Certainly not. You must know that I do not think so. But on the other  hand, the legal mind being used to considering problems of evidence, a  solicitor will be able to advise you of the best course to adopt, and  that most likely to result in your being spared all association with  the inquiry. Meanwhile--let us hurry. I prefer to give Inspector  Gatton my own account of this visit rather than to be discovered here  by him. He will learn from Marie that I have called, of course, but  that doesn't matter.\"    We had now quitted the flat and were descending the stairs. On  reaching the street I glanced sharply to right and left. But Gatton  was not in sight.    I secured a taxi at the corner and Isobel set out for the office of  Coverly's solicitor. I stood looking after the cab until it was out of  sight and then I set out to walk to the _Planet_ office. By the time  that I had reached Fleet Street I had my ideas in some sort of order  and I sat down to write the first of my articles on the \"_Oritoga_  mystery\"--for under that title the murder of Sir Marcus Coverly was  destined to figure as the _cause celebre_ of the moment. I had more  than one reason for reticence and indeed I experienced no little  difficulty in preparing the requisite amount of copy without involving  Isobel and Eric Coverly. Half-way through my task I paused, laid down  my pen, and was on the point of tearing up the pages already written  and declining the commission at the eleventh hour.    A few minutes' reflection, however, enabled me to see that the best  service I could offer to the suspected man (always assuming that he  had no alibi to offer) was that of representing the facts as I saw  them to the vast public reached by this influential journal. In my own  mind I had never entertained a shadow of suspicion that Coverly was  the culprit. Underlying the horrible case I thought I could perceive  even darker things--a mystery within a mystery; a horror overtopping  horror.    I had just resumed work, then, when a boy came in to inform me that  Gatton had rung up and wished to speak to me.    Half fearful of what I should hear, I went to the adjoining room and  took up the receiver. Presently:    \"Hullo! Is that Mr. Addison?\" came Gatton's voice.    \"Yes, speaking. What developments, Gatton?\"    \"Several. I've got the report of the estate-agent and I've seen the  stage-doorkeeper of the New Avenue! You mustn't write anything until I  see you, but in order to regularize things a bit I've spoken to the  Chief and formally asked his permission to consult you on the  case--about the Egyptian figures, you know. He remembered you at once,  so it's all square. But I've got a bone to pick with you.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"Never mind now. Can you meet me at the Red House at five o'clock?\"    \"Yes. I will be there.\"    \"Good. I don't hope for much. It's the strangest case I ever touched.  We are dealing with unusual people, not ordinary criminals.\"    \"I agree.\"    \"If there is any man in London who can see daylight through the  mystery I believe you are the man. Do you know on what I think the  whole thing turns?\"    \"On some undiscovered incident in Sir Marcus's past, beyond a doubt.  Probably an amorous adventure.\"    \"You're wrong,\" said Gatton grimly. \"It turns on the figure of the  green cat. Good-by. Five o'clock.\"          CHAPTER V    THE INTERRUPTED SUPPER      I arrived at the Red House before Inspector Gatton. A constable was on  duty at the gate and as I came up and paused he regarded me rather  doubtfully until I told him that I had an appointment with Gatton. I  stared up the drive towards the house. It was not, apparently, a very  old building, presenting some of the worst features of the  mid-Victorian period, and from whence it derived its name I could not  conjecture unless from the fact that the greater part of the facade  was overgrown with some kind of red creeper.    The half-moon formed by the crescent-shaped carriage-way and the wall  bordering the road was filled with rather unkempt shrubbery, laurels  and rhododendrons for the most part, from amid which arose several big  trees. In the blaze of the afternoon sun the place looked commonplace  enough with estate agents' bills pasted in the dirty windows, and it  was difficult to conceive that it had been the scene of the mysterious  crime of which at that hour all London was talking and which later was  to form a subject of debate throughout the civilized world.    Gatton joined me within a few minutes of my arrival. He was  accompanied by Constable Bolton with whom I had first visited the Red  House. Bolton was now in plain clothes, and he had that  fish-out-of-water appearance which characterizes the constable in  mufti. Indeed he looked rather dazed, and on arriving before the house  he removed his bowler and mopped his red face with a large  handkerchief, nodding to me as he did so.    \"Good afternoon, sir; it was lucky you came along with me last night.  I thought it was a funny go and I was right, it seems.\"    \"Quite right,\" said Gatton shortly, \"and now here are the keys which  you returned to the depot this morning.\"    From his pocket the Inspector produced a steel ring bearing a large  and a small key which I recognized as that which had hung from the  lock of the garage door on the previous night.    We walked along to the garage and Inspector Gatton placed the key in  the lock; then turning to Bolton:    \"Now,\" he directed, \"show us exactly what you did.\"    Bolton replaced his bowler, which hitherto he had carried in his hand,  hesitated for a moment, and then unlocked the door.    \"Of course I had my lantern with me last night,\" he explained, \"and  this gentleman and myself stood looking in for a moment.\"    \"Mr. Addison has already described to me exactly what he saw,\" said  Gatton. \"Show us what you did after Mr. Addison left you.\"    Bolton, with a far-away look in his eyes betokening an effort of  retrospection, withdrew the key from the lock and entered the garage,  Gatton and I following. There was a sky window to light the place, so  that when Bolton reclosed the door we could see well enough. His  movements were as follows: Relocking the door from the inside, he  walked slowly along to a smaller door at the opposite end and with the  other key attached to the ring unfastened it.    \"Wait a moment,\" said Gatton. \"Did you look about you at all before  opening this door?\"    \"Only long enough to find where it was, sir. Just about as long as I  showed you.\"    \"All right. Go on, then.\"    We followed Bolton out into a very narrow hedge-bordered path,  evidently a tradesman's entrance, and he turned and locked the door  behind him. Slipping the keys into his pocket, he tramped stolidly out  to the main road whereon we emerged immediately beside the garage.    \"Ah,\" murmured Gatton. \"Now give me the keys,\" and as the man did so:  \"Throughout all this time did you see or hear anything of an unusual  nature?\"    Bolton removed his bowler once more. I had gathered by this time that  he regarded fresh air as an aid to reflection.    \"Well, sir,\" he replied in a puzzled way, \"that first door--\"    \"Well,\" said Gatton, as the man hesitated.    \"It seemed to open more easily just now than it did last night. There  seemed to be a sort of hitch before when it was about half-way open.\"    \"Perhaps the crate was in the way?\" suggested Gatton. \"Except for the  absence of the crate do you notice anything different, anything  missing, or anything there now that was not there before?\"    Bolton shook his head.    \"No,\" he answered; \"it looks just the same to me--except, as I say,  that the door seemed to open more easily.\"    \"H'm,\" muttered Gatton; \"and you carried the keys in your pocket until  you went off duty?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"All right. You can go now.\"    Bolton touched his bowler and departed, and Gatton turned to me with a  grim smile.    \"We'll just step inside again,\" he said, \"so as not to attract any  undue attention.\"    He again unlocked the garage door and closed it as we entered.    \"Now,\" said he, \"before we go any further what was your idea in  keeping back the fact that one of the missing links in the chain of  evidence was already in your possession?\"    \"No doubt,\" I said rather guiltily, \"you refer to the fact of my  acquaintance with Miss Isobel"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#6)"],[1,"ime, you can trust them just as far  as you can see them and no farther, and that's the truth,\" cried Nora  O'Malley. The sophomore players were standing in the corridor outside the  gymnasium awaiting the pleasure of the juniors, whose practice time was  up.    \"They are supposed to be out of here at four o'clock,\" continued Nora,  \"and it's fifteen minutes past four now. They are loitering on purpose  They don't dare to do mean things openly since Miss Thompson lectured them  so, but they make up for it by being aggravating.\"    \"Never mind, Nora,\" said Grace, smiling at Nora's outburst. \"We'll whip  them off the face of the earth next Saturday.\"    \"Well, I hope so,\" said Nora, \"I am sure we are better players.\"    \"What outrageous conceit,\" said Jessica, and the four girls laughed  merrily.    \"By the way, Grace,\" said Anne, \"I want to ask you something about that  list you gave me. I don't quite understand what one of those signals  means.\"    \"Trot it out,\" said Grace. \"I'll have time to tell you about it before the  practice actually begins.\"    Anne took out her purse and began searching for the list. It was not to be  found.    \"Why, how strange,\" she said. \"I was looking at it this morning on the way  to school. I wonder if I have lost it. That would be dreadful.\"    She turned her purse upside down, shaking it energetically, but no list  fell out.    \"Oh, never mind,\" said Grace, seeing Anne's distress. \"It's of no  consequence. No one will ever find it anyway. Suppose it were found, who  would know what it meant?\"    \"Yes, but one would know,\" persisted Anne, \"because I wrote 'Sophomore  basketball signals' on the outside of it. Oh, dear, I don't see how I  could have been so careless.\"    \"Poor little Anne,\" said Jessica, \"she is always worried over something or  other.\"    \"Now see here, Anne,\" said Grace, \"just because you lost a letter last  term and had trouble over it, don't begin to mourn over those old signals.  No one will ever see them, and perhaps you haven't lost them. Maybe you'll  find them at home.\"    \"Perhaps I shall,\" said Anne brightening.    \"Now smile Anne,\" said Nora, \"and forget your troubles. There is no use in  crossing bridges before you come to them.\"    This homely old saying seemed to console Anne, and soon she was eagerly  watching the work of the team, her brief anxiety forgotten.    That night she searched her room, and the next day gave her desk in school  a thorough overhauling, but the list of signals remained missing.    The sophomore players with their substitute team met that afternoon in the  gymnasium. It was their last opportunity for practice. Saturday they would  rise to victory or go down in ignominious defeat. The latter seemed to  them impossible. They had practised faithfully, and Grace had been so  earnest in her efforts to perfect their playing that they were completely  under her control and moved like clockwork. There was no weak spot in the  team. Every point had been diligently worked over and mastered. They had  played several games with the freshmen and had won every time, so Grace  was fairly confident of their success.    \"Oh, girls,\" she cried, wringing her hands in her earnestness, \"don't make  any mistakes. Keep your heads, all of you. I am convinced we are better  players than the juniors, even if they did get the pennant last year. For  one thing I don't think they work together as well as we do, and that's  really the main thing. Miriam, you missed practice yesterday. You are  going to stay to-day, aren't you?\"    Miriam nodded without replying. She was busy with her own thoughts. She  wished she could hit upon some way to humiliate Grace Harlowe. But what  could she do? That was the question. The members of the team adored their  gray-eyed, independent young captain, therefore she would have to be very  careful.    She had been steadily losing ground with her class on account of her  constant association with the juniors, and the slightest misstep on her  part would jeopardize her place on the team. She had a genuine love for  the game, and since she couldn't play on the junior team, she concluded it  would be just as well not to lose her place with the sophomores. In her  heart she cared nothing for her class. She had tried to be their leader,  and Grace had supplanted her, but now Grace should pay for it.    All this passed through Miriam's mind as she covertly watched Grace, who  was reassuring Anne for the fiftieth time, not to worry over the lost  signals.    \"Don't tell any one about it,\" she whispered to Anne. \"You may find them  yet.\"    Anne shook her head sorrowfully. She felt in some way that those signals  were bound to make trouble for her.    \"By the way, girls,\" said Grace, addressing the team, \"has any one any  objection to Anne and Jessica staying to see the practice game? They have  seen all our work and are now anxious to see the practice game. They know  all the points, but they want to see how the new signal code works.\"    \"Of course not,\" answered the girls. \"We won't turn Oakdale's star pupil  out of the gym. Anne shall be our mascot. As for Jessica, she is a matter  of course.\"    \"I object,\" said Miriam. \"I object seriously.\"    \"Object?\" repeated Grace, turning in amazement to Miriam. \"Why?\"    \"You know that it is against all basketball rules to allow any one in the  gymnasium during practice except the regular team and the subs. If we  follow our rules then we shall be certain that nothing we do reaches the  ears of the juniors. We have always made an exception of Jessica, but I  don't think we should allow any one else here.\"    \"And do you think that Anne Pierson would carry information?\" exclaimed  Grace sharply. \"Really, Miriam, you are provoking enough to try the  patience of a saint. Just as if Anne, who is the soul of honor, would do  such a thing.\"    An indignant murmur arose from the girls. They were all prepared to like  little Anne, although they did not know her very well.    \"How can you say such things, Miriam?\" cried Nora.    \"I didn't say she would,\" said Miriam rather alarmed at the storm she had  raised. \"But I do think it is better to be careful. However, have it your  own way. But if we lose the game----\"    She paused. Her judgment told her she had said enough. If anything did  happen, the blame would fall on Grace's shoulders.    Anne, deeply hurt, tried to leave the gymnasium but the girls caught her,  and brought her back again. She shed a few tears, but soon forgot her  grief in the interest of the game.    \"Girls,\" said Grace, as she and Nora and Jessica walked down the street  that night after leaving Anne at her corner, \"we must look out for Anne.  It is evident from the way Miriam acted to-day that she will never lose an  opportunity to hurt Anne's feelings. I thought perhaps time would soften  her wrath, but it looks as though she still nursed her old grudge.\"    How true Grace's words were to prove she could not at that time foresee.    \"Well,\" said Nora, \"Anne is one of the nicest girls in Oakdale, and if  Miriam knows when she's well off she'll mind her own business.\"    The day before the game, as Grace was leaving school, she heard David's  familiar whistle and turned to see the young man hurrying toward her, a  look of subdued excitement upon his face.    \"I've been looking all over for you, Grace,\" he said, as he lifted his cap  to her. \"I have something to tell you. This afternoon after school, Reddy,  Hippy and I went out to the old Omnibus House. I wanted to show the  fellows some things about my machine. While we were out there who should  appear but Julia Crosby and some more of her crowd. They were having a  regular pow-wow and were in high glee over something. We kept still  because we knew if they saw us they'd descend upon us in a body. They  stayed a long time and Julia Crosby made a speech. I couldn't hear what  she said, but it seemed to be about the proper thing, for her satellites  applauded about every two minutes. Then they got their heads together and  all talked at once. While they were so busy we skipped out without being  noticed. I thought I'd better tell you, for I have an idea they are  putting up some scheme to queer you in the game to-morrow; so look out for  them.\"    \"Thank you, David,\" answered Grace. \"You are always looking after our  interests. I wonder what those juniors are planning. They are obliged to  play a fair game, for they know perfectly well what will happen if they  don't. Miss Thompson will be there to-morrow, and they know she has her  eye on them.\"    \"Put not your trust in juniors,\" cautioned David. \"They may elude even her  watchful eye.\"    \"You are coming to see us play to-morrow, aren't you, David?\" asked Grace.    \"I'll be there before the doors are open, with Reddy and Hippy at my  heels,\" responded David. \"Good-bye, Grace. Look out for squalls  to-morrow.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE DEEPEST POSSIBLE DISGRACE      A feeling of depression swept over Grace Harlowe as she looked out the  window the next morning. The rain was falling heavily and the skies were  sullen and gray.    \"What a miserable day for the game,\" was her first thought. \"I do hope the  rain won't keep people away. This weather is enough to discourage any  one.\"    All morning she watched anxiously for the clouds to lift, going from  window to door until her mother told her to stop fretting about the  weather and save her strength for the coming game.    The game was set for two o'clock, but at one, Grace put on her raincoat  and set out for the High School. She knew she was early, but she felt that  she couldn't stay in the house a minute longer.    One by one the sophomore team and its substitutes assembled, but the rain  had dampened their spirits and the enthusiasm of the past few days had  left them.    Grace looked worried, as she noticed how listless her players seemed. She  wished it had been one of those cold, crisp days that set the blood"]]]
