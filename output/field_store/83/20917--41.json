Rhyme, which in Persian  poetry is an indispensable requisite, is never employed.           *       *       *       *       *    The moralizing tendency which characterizes all of Herder's work, and  which grew stronger as he advanced in years, rendered him indifferent  to the purely artistic side of poetry. He makes no effort in his  versions to bring out what is characteristically Oriental in the  original; on the contrary, he often destroys it. Thus his \"Blume des  Paradieses\" (_Bl._ iv. 7 = H. 548) is addressed to a girl instead of a  boy. The fourth couplet is accordingly altered to suit the sense, while  the last couplet, which according to the law governing the construction  of the Persian _gazal_ contained the name of the poet, is omitted. So  also in \"Der heilige Wahnsinn\" (_Verm._ 6 = _Gul._ v. 18, ed. Platts, p.  114) the characteristic Persian phrase         [Arabic]         \"It is necessary to survey Laila's beauty from the window of       Majnun's eye\"    appears simply as \"O ... sieh mit meinen Augen an.\"    This exclusive interest in the purely didactic side induced Herder also  to remove the maxims from the stories which in the _Gulistan_ or  _Hitopadesa_ served as their setting. So they appear simply as general  sententious literature, whereas in the originals they are as a rule  introduced solely to illustrate or to emphasize some particular point of  the story. Then again a story may be considerably shortened, as in \"Die  Luege\" (_Bl._ ii. 28 = _Gul._ i. 1), \"Der heilige Wahnsinn\" (see above).  To atone for such abridgment new lines embodying in most cases a general  moral reflection are frequently added. Thus both the pieces just cited  have such additions. In \"Verschiedener Umgang\" (_Ged._ 3 = Bhart.  _Nitis._ 67; Boehtl. 6781) the first three lines are evidently  inspired by the last line of the Sanskrit proverb: _prayena  'dhamamadhyamottamagunah samsargato jayate_ \"in general the lowest, the  middle and the highest quality arise from association,\" but they are in  no sense a translation.    What we have given suffices to characterize Herder as a translator or  adapter of Oriental poetry. His Eastern studies have scarcely exerted  any influence on his original poems beyond inspiring some fervid lines  in praise of India and its dramatic art as exhibited in _Sakuntala_,[84]  which had just then (1791) been translated by Forster into German from  the English version of Sir William Jones. Unlike his illustrious  contemporary Goethe he received from the East no impulse that stimulated  him to production. His one-sided preference for the purely didactic  element rendered him indifferent to the lyric beauty of Hafid and  caused him to proclaim Sa'di as the model most worthy of imitation.[85]  Yet it was Hafid, the prince of Persian lyric poets, the singer of wine  and roses, who fired the soul of Germany's greatest poet and inspired  him to write the _Divan_, and thus Hafid became the dominating  influence and the guiding star of the _west-oestliche Richtung_ in German  poetry.

[81] We may state here that the work in question has been thoroughly  commented on by such scholars as Duentzer and Redlich, and their comments  may be found in the editions of Suphan and Meyer. The same has been done  for Goethe's Divan by Duentzer and Loeper. The former's notes are in his  Goethe-edition in the Kuerschner-series, the latter's in the edition of  Hempel. In this investigation, therefore, the chapters on Herder and  Goethe are somewhat briefer than they otherwise would be, as further  details as to sources, etc., are easily accessible in the editions just  mentioned.

Enthusiasm for Sakuntala--Der Gott und die Bajadere; Der        Paria--Goethe's Aversion for Hindu Mythology--Origin of the        Divan--Oriental Character of the Work--Inaugurates the Oriental        Movement.      In _Wahrheit und Dichtung_ (B. xii. vol. xxii. p. 86) Goethe tells us  that he first became acquainted with Hindu fables through Dapper's book  of travel,[86] while pursuing his law studies at Wetzlar, in 1771. He  amused his circle of literary friends by relating stories of Rama and  the monkey _Hanneman_ (i.e. Hanuman), who speedily won the favor of the  audience. The poet himself, however, could not get any lasting pleasure  from monstrosities; misshapen divinities shocked his aesthetic sense.    The first time that Goethe's attention was turned seriously to Eastern  literature was in 1791, when, through Herder's efforts, he made the  acquaintance of Kalidasa's dramatic masterpiece _Sakuntala_, which  inspired the well known epigram \"Willst du die Bluete des fruehen,\" etc.,  an extravagant eulogy rather than an appreciative criticism. That the  impression was not merely momentary is proved by the fact that five  years later the poet took the inspiration for his _Faust_ prologue from  Kalidasa's work.[87] Otherwise it cannot be said that the then just  awakening Sanskrit studies exercised any considerable influence on his  poetic activity. For his two ballads dealing with Indic subjects, \"Der  Gott und die Bajadere\" and \"Der Paria\", the material was taken, not from  works of Sanskrit literature, but from a book of travel. The former poem  was completed in 1797, though the idea was taken as early as 1783 from  a German version of Sonnerat's travels, where the story is related  according to the account of Abraham Roger[88] in _De Open-Deure_. There  the account is as follows: \"'t Is ghebeurt ... dat Dewendre, onder  Menschelijcke ghedaente, op eenen tijdt ghekomen is by een sekere Hoere,  de welcke hy heeft willen beproeven of sy oock ghetrouw was. Hy  accordeert met haer, ende gaf haer een goet Hoeren loon. Na den loon  onthaelde sy hem dien nacht heel wel, sonder dat sy haer tot slapen  begaf. Doch 't soude in dien nacht ghebeurt zijn dat Dewendre sich  geliet of hy stierf; ende storf soo sy meynde. De Hoere die wilde met  hem branden, haer Vrienden en konde het haer niet afraden; de welcke  haer voor-hielden dat het haer Man niet en was. Maer nadien dat sy haer  niet en liet gheseggen, soo lietse het yver toestellen om daer in te  springen. Op't uyterste ghekomen zijnde, ontwaeckte Dewendre, ende  seyde, dat hy hem hadde ghelaten doot te zijn, alleenlijck om te  ondervinden hare trouwe; ende hy seyde haer toe, tot een loon van hare  ghetrouwigheyt, dat sy met hem na Dewendrelocon (dat is een der platsen  der gelucksaligheyt) gaen soude. Ende ghelijck den Bramine seyde, ist  alsoo gheschiet.\"[89]    It will be seen that Goethe has changed the story considerably and for  the better. How infinitely nobler is his idea of uniting the maiden with  her divine lover on the flaming pyre from which both ascend to heaven!  It may also be observed that Goethe substitutes Mahadeva, i.e. Siva, for  Dewendre[90] and assigns to him an incarnation, though such incarnations  are known only of Visnu.           *       *       *       *       *    The \"Paria,\" a trilogy consisting of \"Gebet,\" \"Legende\" and \"Dank des  Paria,\" was begun in 1816, but not finished until December, 1821. Even  then it was not quite complete. The appearance of Delavigne's _Le Paria_  and still more of Michael Beer's drama of the same name, spurred Goethe  to a final effort and the poem was published in October, 1823.    The direct source is the legend which Sonnerat tells of the origin of  the Paria-goddess Mariatale.[91] Indirectly, however, the sources are  found in Sanskrit literature. Two parts may be distinguished: The story  of the temptation and punishment, and the story of the interchange of  heads.[92] The former story is that of the ascetic Jamadagni and his  wife Renuka, who was slain by her son Rama at the command of the ascetic  himself, in punishment for her yielding to an impure desire on beholding  the prince Citraratha. Subsequently at the intercession of Rama she is  again restored to life through Jamadagni's supernatural power. The story  is in _Mahabharata_ iii. c. 116 seq.[93] and also in the _Bhagavata  Purana_, Bk. ix. c. 16,[94] though here the harshness of the original  version is somewhat softened.[95]    The second story is found in the _Vetalapancavims'ati_, being the sixth  of the \"twenty-five tales of a corpse-demon,\" which are also found in  the twelfth book of the _Kathasaritsagara_.[96] It relates how  Madanasundari, whose husband and brother-in-law had beheaded themselves  in honor of Durga, is commanded by the goddess to restore the corpses to  life by joining to each its own head, and how by mistake she  interchanges these heads.    The two stories were fused into one and so we get the legend in the form  in which Sonnerat presents it. Goethe followed this form closely without  inventing anything. He did, however, put into the poem an ethical  content and a noble idea. Both the Indic ballads are a fervent plea for  the innate nobility of humanity.           *       *       *       *       *    Here the influence of India on Goethe's work ends. The progress of  Sanskrit studies could not fail to excite the interest of the poet whose  boast"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#6)"],[1,"out upon the grayness of London in November. A  slight mental effort was sufficient to blot out that drab prospect and  to conjure up before my mind's eye a balcony overlooking the Nile--a  glimpse of dusty palms, a white wall overgrown with purple blossoms,  and above all the dazzling vault of Egypt. Upon the balcony my  imagination painted a figure, limning it with loving details, the  figure of Karamaneh; and I thought that her glorious eyes would be  sorrowful and her lips perhaps a little tremulous, as, her arms resting  upon the rail of the balcony, she looked out across the smiling river  to the domes and minarets of Cairo--and beyond, into the hazy distance;  seeing me in dreary, rain-swept London, as I saw her, at Gezira  beneath the cloudless sky of Egypt.    From these tender but mournful reflections I aroused myself, almost  angrily, and set off through the muddy streets towards Charing Cross;  for I was availing myself of the opportunity to call upon Dr. Murray,  who had purchased my small suburban practice when (finally, as I  thought at the time) I had left London.    This matter occupied me for the greater part of the afternoon, and I  returned to the New Louvre Hotel shortly after five, and seeing no one  in the lobby whom I knew, proceeded immediately to our apartment.  Nayland Smith was not there, and having made some changes in my attire  I descended again and inquired if he had left any message for me.    The booking-clerk informed me that Smith had not returned; therefore I  resigned myself to wait. I purchased an evening paper and settled down  in the lounge where I had an uninterrupted view of the entrance doors.  The dinner hour approached, but still my friend failed to put in an  appearance. Becoming impatient, I entered a call-box and rang up  Inspector Weymouth.    Smith had not been to Scotland Yard, nor had they received any message  from him. Perhaps it would appear that there was little cause for alarm  in this, but I, familiar with my friend's punctual and exact habits,  became strangely uneasy. I did not wish to make myself ridiculous,  but growing restlessness impelled me to institute inquiries regarding  the cabman who had driven my friend. The result of these was to  increase rather than to allay my fears.    The man was a stranger to the hall-porter, and he was not one of the  taximen who habitually stood upon the neighboring rank; no one seemed  to have noticed the number of the cab.    And now my mind began to play with strange doubts and fears. The driver,  I recollected, had been a small, dark man, possessing remarkably  well-cut olive-hued features. Had he not worn spectacles he would  indeed have been handsome, in an effeminate fashion.    I was almost certain, by this time, that he had not been an Englishman;  I was almost certain that some catastrophe had befallen Smith. Our  ceaseless vigilance had been momentarily relaxed--and this was the  result!    At some large bank branches there is a resident messenger. Even  granting that such was the case in the present instance, I doubted if  the man could help me, unless, as was possible, he chanced to be  familiar with my friend's appearance, and had actually seen him there  that day. I determined, at any rate, to make the attempt; reentering  the call-box, I asked for the bank's number.    There proved to be a resident messenger, who, after a time, replied to  my call. He knew Nayland Smith very well by sight, and as he had been  on duty in the public office of the bank at the time that Smith should  have arrived, he assured me that my friend had not been there that day!    \"Besides, sir,\" he said, \"you say he came to deposit valuables of some  kind here?\"    \"Yes, yes!\" I cried eagerly.    \"I take all such things down on the lift to the vaults at night, sir,  under the supervision of the assistant manager--and I can assure you  that nothing of the kind has been left with us to-day.\"    I stepped out of the call-box unsteadily. Indeed, I clutched at the  door for support.    \"What is the meaning of Si-Fan?\" Detective-sergeant Fletcher had asked  that morning. None of us could answer him; none of us knew. With a  haze seeming to dance between my eyes and the active life in the lobby  before me, I realized that the Si-Fan--that unseen, sinister power--  had reached out and plucked my friend from the very midst of this  noisy life about me, into its own mysterious, deathly silence.        CHAPTER VII    CHINATOWN      \"It's no easy matter,\" said Inspector Weymouth, \"to patrol the vicinity  of John Ki's Joy-Shop without their getting wind of it. The entrance,  as you'll see, is a long, narrow rat-hole of a street running at right  angles to the Thames. There's no point, so far as I know, from which  the yard can be overlooked; and the back is on a narrow cutting  belonging to a disused mill.\"    I paid little attention to his words. Disguised beyond all chance of  recognition even by one intimate with my appearance, I was all  impatience to set out. I had taken Smith's place in the night's  program; for, every possible source of information having been tapped  in vain, I now hoped against hope that some clue to the fate of my poor  friend might be obtained at the Chinese den which he had designed to  visit with Fletcher.    The latter, who presented a strange picture in his make-up as a sort  of half-caste sailor, stared doubtfully at the Inspector; then--    \"The River Police cutter,\" he said, \"can drop down on the tide and lie  off under the Surrey bank. There's a vacant wharf facing the end of  the street and we can slip through and show a light there, to let you  know we've arrived. You reply in the same way. If there's any  trouble, I shall blaze away with this\"--he showed the butt of a  Service revolver protruding from his hip pocket--\"and you can be  ashore in no time.\"    The plan had one thing to commend it, viz., that no one could devise  another. Therefore it was adopted, and five minutes later a taxi-cab  swung out of the Yard containing Inspector Weymouth and two ruffianly  looking companions--myself and Fletcher.    Any zest with which, at another time, I might have entered upon such  an expedition, was absent now. I bore with me a gnawing anxiety and  sorrow that precluded all conversation on my part, save monosyllabic  replies, to questions that I comprehended but vaguely.    At the River Police Depot we found Inspector Ryman, an old acquaintance,  awaiting us. Weymouth had telephoned from Scotland Yard.    \"I've got a motor-boat at the breakwater,\" said Ryman, nodding to  Fletcher, and staring hard at me.    Weymouth laughed shortly.    \"Evidently you don't recognize Dr. Petrie!\" he said.    \"Eh!\" cried Ryman--\"Dr. Petrie! why, good heavens, Doctor, I should  never have known you in a month of Bank holidays! What's afoot,  then?\"--and he turned to Weymouth, eyebrows raised interrogatively.    \"It's the Fu-Manchu business again, Ryman.\"    \"Fu-Manchu! But I thought the Fu-Manchu case was off the books long  ago? It was always a mystery to me; never a word in the papers; and  we as much in the dark as everybody else--but didn't I hear that the  Chinaman, Fu-Manchu, was dead?\"    Weymouth nodded.    \"Some of his friends seem to be very much alive, though\" he said.  \"It appears that Fu-Manchu, for all his genius--and there's no denying  he was a genius, Ryman--was only the agent of somebody altogether  bigger.\"    Ryman whistled softly.    \"Has the real head of affairs arrived, then?\"    \"We find we are up against what is known as the Si-Fan.\"    At that it came to the inevitable, unanswerable question.    \"What is the Si-Fan?\"    I laughed, but my laughter was not mirthful. Inspector Weymouth shook  his head.    \"Perhaps Mr. Nayland Smith could tell you that,\" he replied; \"for the  Si-Fan got him to-day!\"    \"Got him!\" cried Ryman.    \"Absolutely! He's vanished! And Fletcher here has found out that John  Ki's place is in some way connected with this business.\"    I interrupted--impatiently, I fear.    \"Then let us set out, Inspector,\" I said, \"for it seems to me that we  are wasting precious time--and you know what that may mean.\" I turned  to Fletcher. \"Where is this place situated, exactly? How do we proceed?\"    \"The cab can take us part of the way,\" he replied, \"and we shall have  to walk the rest. Patrons of John's don't turn up in taxis, as a rule!\"    \"Then let us be off,\" I said, and made for the door.    \"Don't forget the signal!\" Weymouth cried after me, \"and don't venture  into the place until you've received our reply....\"    But I was already outside, Fletcher following; and a moment later we  were both in the cab and off into a maze of tortuous streets toward  John Ki's Joy-Shop.    With the coming of nightfall the rain had ceased, but the sky remained  heavily overcast and the air was filled with clammy mist. It was a  night to arouse longings for Southern skies; and when, discharging  the cabman, we set out afoot along a muddy and ill-lighted  thoroughfare bordered on either side by high brick walls, their  monotony occasionally broken by gateways, I felt that the load of  depression which had settled upon my shoulders must ere long bear me  down.    Sounds of shunting upon some railway siding came to my ears; train  whistles and fog signals hooted and boomed. River sounds there were,  too, for we were close beside the Thames, that gray old stream which  has borne upon its bier many a poor victim of underground London. The  sky glowed sullenly red above.    \"There's the Joy-Shop, along on the left,\" said Fletcher, breaking in  upon my reflections. \"You'll notice a faint light; it's shining out  through the open door. Then, here is the wharf.\"    He began fumbling with the fastenings of a dilapidated gateway beside  which we were standing; and a moment later--    \"All right--slip through,\" he said.    I followed him through the narrow gap which the ruinous state of the  gates had"]]]
