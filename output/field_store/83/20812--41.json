The _leaves are      silvery-white_ and downy on the under side. The twigs are dark green      in color and densely covered with a white down. It grows to very      large size and forms an irregular, wide-spreading, broad head, which      is characteristically different from that of any of the other      poplars.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Bark of the Silver Poplar.]        The _quaking aspen_ (_Populus tremuloides_), the _large-toothed      aspen_ (_Populus grandidentata_) and the _balsam poplar_ or _balm of      Gilead_ (_Populus balsamifera_) are other common members of the      poplar group. The quaking aspen may be told by its reddish-brown      twigs, narrow sharp-pointed buds, and by its small finely toothed      leaves. The large-toothed aspen has thicker and rather downy buds      and broader and more widely toothed leaves. The balsam poplar has a      large bud thickly covered with a sticky, pungent, gelatinous      substance.      GINGKO OR MAIDENHAIR TREE (_Gingko biloba_)    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Gingko Trees.]    Distinguishing characters: The *peculiar branches* of this tree *emerge      upward* from a straight tapering trunk *at an angle of about 45 deg.*      and give to the whole tree a striking, Oriental appearance, which is      quite different from that of any other tree, Fig. 44.    Leaf: Like that of a leaflet of maidenhair fern, Fig. 45.    Range: A native of northern China and introduced into eastern North      America.    Soil and location: The gingko will grow in poor soils.    Enemies: Practically free from insects and disease.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Leaves of the Gingko Tree.]    Value for planting: It makes a valuable tree for the street where heavy      shade is not the object and forms an excellent wide-spreading      specimen tree on the lawn.    Other characters: The _fruit_ consists of a stone covered by sweet,      ill-smelling flesh. The tree is dioecious, there being separate male      and female trees. The male tree is preferable for planting in order      to avoid the disagreeable odor of the fruit which appears on the      female trees when about thirty years old. The male tree has a      narrower crown than the female tree. The buds (Fig. 46) are very odd      and are conspicuous on the tree throughout the winter. The leaves of      the gingko shed in the winter. In this respect the tree is like the      larch and the bald cypress.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Bud of the Gingko Tree.]        The gingko belongs to the yew family, which is akin to the pine      family. It is therefore a very old tree, the remains of the forests      of the ancient world. The gingko in its early life is tall and      slender with its few branches close to the stem. But after a time      the branches loosen up and form a wide-spreading crown. In the      Orient it attains enormous proportions and in this country it also      grows to a fairly large size when planted on the open lawn or in      groups far apart from other trees so that it can have plenty of room      to spread. It then produces a picturesque effect of unusual      interest.      WEEPING WILLOW (_Salix babylonica_)    Distinguishing characters: All the willows have a single cap-like scale      to the bud, and this species has an unusually *drooping mass of      slender branchlets* which characterizes the tree from all others,      Fig. 47.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Weeping Willow.]    Form and size: It grows to large size.    Range: Asia and Europe and naturalized in eastern United States.    Soil and location: Prefers moist places near streams and ponds.    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: The weeping willow has a special ornamental effect      in cemeteries and along lakes and river banks in parks.    Commercial value: It is used in the United States for charcoal and for      fuel.    Comparisons: The _pussy willow_ (_Salix discolor_) may easily be told      from the other willows by its small size; it is often no higher than      a tall shrub. Its branches are _reddish green_ and the buds are dark      red, smooth and glossy. The predominating color of the twigs and      buds in the pussy willow is therefore a shade of _red_, while in the      weeping willow it is _yellowish green_.        GROUP VII. TREES TOLD BY THEIR BARK OR TRUNK: SYCAMORE, BIRCH, BEECH,  BLUE BEECH, IRONWOOD, AND HACKBERRY    How to tell them from other trees: The _color of the bark or the form of      the trunk_ of each of the trees in this group is distinct from that      of any other tree.    How to tell them from each other: In the sycamore, the bark is      _mottled_; in the white birch, it is _dull white_; in the beech, it      is _smooth and gray_; in the hackberry, it is covered with numerous      _corky warts_; in the blue beech, the trunk of the tree is _fluted_,      as in Fig. 54, and in the ironwood, the bark _peels_ in thin      perpendicular strips.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Bark of the Sycamore Tree.]      THE SYCAMORE OR PLANE TREE (_Platanus occidentalis_)    Distinguishing characters: The peculiar *mottled appearance* of the      *bark* (Fig. 48) in the trunk and large branches is the striking      character here. The bark produces this effect by shedding in large,      thin, brittle plates. The newly exposed bark is of a yellowish green      color which often turns nearly white later on. *Round seed balls*,      about an inch in diameter, may be seen hanging on the tree all      winter. In this species, the seed balls are usually solitary, while      in the Oriental sycamore, a European tree similar to the native one,      they appear in clusters of two, or occasionally of three or four.      See Fig. 49.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Seed-balls of the Oriental Sycamore. Note one  Seed-ball cut in half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Gray or White Birch Trees.]    Leaf: The stem of the leaf completely covers the bud. This is a      characteristic peculiar to sycamores.    Form and size: A large tree with massive trunk and branches and a broad      head.    Range: Eastern and southern United States.    Soil and location: Prefers a deep rich soil, but will adapt itself even      to the poor soil of the city street.    Enemies: The sycamore is frequently attacked by a fungus (_Gloeosporium      nervisequum_), which curls up the young leaves and kills the tips of      the branches. Late frosts also often injure its young twigs. The      Oriental sycamore, which is the European species, is more hardy in      these respects than the native one and is therefore often chosen as      a substitute.    Value for planting: The Occidental sycamore is now planted very little,      but the Oriental sycamore is used quite extensively in its place,      especially as a shade tree. The Oriental sycamore is superior to the      native species in many ways. It is more shapely, faster growing, and      hardier than the native one. Both sycamores will bear transplanting      and pruning well.    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Bark of the Black or Sweet Birch.]    Commercial value: The wood of the sycamore is coarse-grained and hard to      work; used occasionally for inside finishing in buildings.    Other names: _Buttonball_, _buttonwood_.    Comparisons: The _Oriental sycamore_ (_Platanus orientalis_) an      introduced species, is apt to be confused with the Occidental      sycamore, but may be told from the latter by the number of seed      balls suspended from the tree. In the case of the Oriental species,      the seed balls hang in _pairs_ or (rarely) three or four together.      In the Occidental, the seed balls are generally _solitary_ and very      rarely in pairs.      GRAY OR WHITE BIRCH (_Betula populifolia_)    Distinguishing characters: The *dull-white color of the bark* on the      trunk and the _dark triangular patches below the insertion of the      branches_ distinguish this tree; see Fig. 50. The bark of the young      trunks and branches is reddish-brown in color and glossy. The bark      adheres closely to the trunk of the tree and does not peel in loose,      shaggy strips, as in the case of the yellow or golden birch. It is      marked by small raised horizontal lines which are the lenticels or      breathing pores. These lenticels are characteristic of all birch and      cherry trees. In addition to the distinction in the color of the      bark, an important character which distinguishes the gray birch from      all other species of birch, is found in the *terminal twigs*, which      are *rough* to the touch.    Form and size: A small tree. Frequently grows in clumps.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: The gray birch does best in a deep, rich soil, but      will also grow in poor soils.    Enemies: The _bronze-birch borer_, a wood-destroying insect, and      _Polyporus betulinus_, a fungus, are its chief enemies.    Value for planting: Its graceful habit and attractive bark gives the      tree an important place in ornamental planting. It may be used to      advantage with evergreens, and produces a charming effect when      planted by itself in clumps.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Bark of the Beech.]    [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Buds of the Beech Tree.]    Commercial value: The wood is soft and not durable. It is used in the      manufacture of small articles and for wood pulp.    Other characters: The _fruit is a catkin_.    Comparisons: The _paper birch_ (_Betula papyrifera_) is apt to be      confused with the gray birch, because both have a white bark. The      bark of the paper birch, however, is a clear white and peels off in      thin papery layers instead of being close. It very seldom shows any      dark triangular markings on the trunk. Its terminal twigs are not      rough and its trunk is usually straighter and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#6)"],[1,"Latin, he in turn taught  Plasencia the elements of Tagalog which he had picked up. For two years  Plasencia ministered in the provinces of Tayabas, Laguna, and Bulacan  where he used and perfected his knowledge of the native language. On  May 20, 1579, when the provincial Pedro de Alfaro left for China,  he named Plasencia acting provincial during his absence. A reference  to the earliest linguistic writings of the Franciscans occurs in an  account by Santa Ines of the chapter meeting held in the Convent of  Los Angeles in July 1580, which was presided over by Plasencia:          \"The third and last thing that was determined in this chapter      was that a grammar and dictionary of the Tagalog language      should be made and a translation of the Doctrina Christiana      completed. And since Fr. Juan de Plasencia, the president of      this same chapter, excelled all in the language, he was given      this responsibility, and he accepted it, and immediately set to      work. And then after great study, much lack of sleep and care,      together with fervent prayers and other spiritual duties,      of not little importance in the good profit of such work,      he reduced the language to a grammar, made a catechism,      a very full dictionary, and various translations.\" [77]      But the most important record of his writings is contained in  the description of the Synod called by Bishop Salazar in 1582. In  March, 1581, Domingo de Salazar, the first Bishop of Manila and the  Philippines, had arrived. The problems which faced him were manifold,  particularly those of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the treatment of the  natives by government administrators, and the means by which the gospel  could best be spread. A synod was called to resolve these points. One  matter of the utmost importance was the approval of standard Tagalog  texts, and Juan de la Concepcion gives the following account of what  transpired in this connection:          \"His excellency presided at the meetings. At them the most      learned topics were discussed and the most learned persons      were present--the Dominican father Salvatierra, the most      outstanding scholars among the Augustinians and Franciscans,      the Jesuit fathers Sedeno and Sanchez, and the Licentiate      Don Diego Vasquez de Mercado as dean of the new cathedral. At      this convention or diocesan synod it was discussed whether the      Indians were to be ministered to in their native language, or      if they would be obliged to learn Spanish, and it was decided      to instruct them in their native tongue. The divine office,      the Doctrina Christiana, which Father Fr. Juan de Plasencia      had translated into the Tagalog language, was approved. His      work, the _Arte y Vocabuldrio Tagalo_, was judged most useful      because of the ease by which it permitted an understanding      and thorough knowledge of so foreign a language.\" [78]      The already quoted account of Santa Ines continues with a similar  description of the Synod, and says that when the problem of teaching  the natives was brought up only Plasencia could resolve it.          \"Since, having seen his catechism and the translation which he      had made in Tagalog of the grammar and dictionary, those who      were at the Synod and understood anything of the language could      do nothing but admire the fitness of the terms, their efficacy      and strength. And they said that, without the particular      help of heaven, it seemed impossible that in so short a time      and with so few years in the country he could have done such      excellent work. And then, having approved them, they ordered      that various copies be made, particularly of the translation      of the Doctrina, so that with them and with no other would      the ministers teach the Indians, and so it was approved,      in order that there might be uniformity in all parts of the      Tagalog country. This translation is that which has come down      to this day, except that it is more polished.\" [79]      It must have been shortly after the handbooks of Plasencia received  the seal of ecclesiastical approval that Salazar wrote the King  speaking of the action taken, and got back in answer the cedula, quoted  before, giving the Bishop and Audiencia the right of censorship over  such works. The question of chronological precedence [80] between  Quinones and Plasencia is not important, for the specific approval  of Plasencia's texts by the Synod, attended by Quinones himself,  shows that Plasencia's books were accepted, and in conformity with  the ruling of the Synod would have been the only texts allowed to be  used generally in the Philippines.    Another reference to writers in the native tongues in an anonymous  manuscript of 1649 introduces the names of other linguists:          \"The first missionaries left many writings in the Tagalog      and Bicol languages, the best of which are those left by      Fathers Fray Juan de Oliver, Fray Juan de Plasencia, Fray      Miguel de Talavera, Fray Diego de la Asuncion, and Fray      Geronimo Monte. Mention is here made of the above fathers      because they were the first masters of the Tagalog language,      and since their writings are so common and so well received      by all the orders. They have not been printed, because they      are voluminous, and there are no arrangements in this kingdom      for printing so much.\" [81]      Miguel de Talavera we have spoken of before. That he helped Plasencia  in the compilation of his earliest works in Tagalog is clear, and  to him in part must be attributed the miracle of the production by  Plasencia of the texts \"in so short a time and with so few years  in the country.\" Martinez says specifically that Talavera \"was the  first interpreter among our priests, and greatly helped Fr. Juan  de Plasencia in the composition of the _Arte y Vocabulario_.\" [82]  Juan de Oliver was in somewhat the same relationship to Plasencia,  but instead of helping with the initial attempts, he carried on from  where Plasencia left off. Oliver came to the Philippines on the same  expedition which brought Bishop Salazar in 1581. According to Huerta  [83] he worked in various Tagalog villages, and mastered the Tagalog  and Bicol languages, in which he wrote twenty-two works, which Huerta  lists. Of these three are of particular interest to us. The first  entry says that he \"corrected the Tagalog grammar written by Fr. Juan  de Plasencia, and added the adverbs and particles;\" [84] the second  that \"he perfected and augmented the Spanish-Tagalog dictionary,  written by the said Fr. Juan de Plasencia;\" and the sixteenth lists  a _Catecismo de doctrina Cristiana esplicado_.    Several authors, attempting to establish the priority of Quinones'  dictionary, question the existence of one by Plasencia at the Synod  of 1582 in the face of his own statement in 1585 that he \"was then  making a dictionary.\" [85] To us there seems to be no inconsistency,  if Plasencia in 1585 was referring to a revision, unquestionably  made with his knowledge and help, by Juan de Oliver. In short, it  is reasonable to assume that Plasencia, burdened with administrative  duties from 1583 to 1586, during which time he was custodian of his  order, secured the aid of Oliver in reediting and continuing his  linguistic studies. Plasencia died in 1590.    The other two Franciscans listed by the anonymous historian of  1649 are elsewhere recorded as having written various works in  Tagalog. To both Diego de la Asuncion [86] and Geronimo Montes y  Escamillo [87] were attributed grammars and dictionaries, and the  latter also wrote a _Devotional tagalog_, said to have been printed  at Manila in 1610. In speaking of these early linguistic texts, it is  not necessary to believe that each was a completely original work,  but rather that they were based upon a recognized model, which was  at first the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver text, and that the individual  missionaries used their experience in the field to produce, as it  were, new editions. That this was the case is borne out by the notes  of Pablo Rojo to his bibliography of Plasencia where speaking of the  grammar and dictionary he says that \"perfected by other missionaries,  they have been the base for such grammars and dictionaries of Tagalog  as have been written, but in the form in which they came from the  hands of their author, they have not come down to us.\" [88] More  important still is Rojo's statement [89] that he found a portion of  Plasencia's Doctrina which had been believed lost, and from which he  quotes the Pater Noster. Since he does not say where the manuscript  was or how it was known to be Plasencia's text, we cannot put too  much reliance on the statement, but the text as there printed, while  similar to that of the present Doctrina, is not identical.        THE JESUITS      Before passing on to the Dominicans we shall mention briefly the  linguists of the Society of Jesus. In the early days there were not  many Jesuits in the Philippines. However, there were some linguists  among them, chiefly of the Visayan tongue, in which they are said to  have printed a Doctrina [90] as early as 1610. Limiting ourselves to  a note of those who knew Chinese and Tagalog, we find that the first  mentioned by Chirino as an outstanding master of one of these was  Francisco Almerique, who arrived with Santiago de Vera in 1583. Shortly  thereafter he \"began the study of the Chinese language in his zeal  to aid in the conversion of the many Chinese who came to Manila and  whom we in the Philippines call Sangleys.\" [91] And Colin says \"his  principal occupation was with the Tagalog Indians, being the first of  the Company to learn their language.\" [92] Nothing further is said of  his accomplishments in these languages, but his knowledge would have  been available in 1593, for he was then still active in the islands.    Chirino himself landed at Manila"]]]
