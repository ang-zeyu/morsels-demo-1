[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#6)"],[1,"a fine lady she wanted to be mistress over me. I thought it very  hard for a coloured woman to have rule over me because I was a slave and  she was free. Her name was Martha Wilcox; she was a saucy woman, very  saucy; and she went and complained of me, without cause, to my mistress,  and made her angry with me. Mrs. Wood told me that if I did not mind what  I was about, she would get my master to strip me and give me fifty lashes:  \"You have been used to the whip,\" she said, \"and you shall have it here.\"  This was the first time she threatened to have me flogged; and she gave me  the threatening so strong of what she would have done to me, that I  thought I should have fallen down at her feet, I was so vexed and hurt by  her words. The mulatto woman was rejoiced to have power to keep me down.  She was constantly making mischief; there was no living for the slaves--no  peace after she came.    I was also sent by Mrs. Wood to be put in the Cage one night, and was next  morning flogged, by the magistrate's order, at her desire; and this all  for a quarrel I had about a pig with another slave woman. I was flogged on  my naked back on this occasion: although I was in no fault after all; for  old Justice Dyett, when we came before him, said that I was in the right,  and ordered the pig to be given to me. This was about two or three years  after I came to Antigua.    When we moved from the middle of the town to the Point, I used to be in  the house and do all the work and mind the children, though still very ill  with the rheumatism. Every week I had to wash two large bundles of  clothes, as much as a boy could help me to lift; but I could give no  satisfaction. My mistress was always abusing and fretting after me. It is  not possible to tell all her ill language.--One day she followed me foot  after foot scolding and rating me. I bore in silence a great deal of ill  words: at last my heart was quite full, and I told her that she ought not  to use me so;--that when I was ill I might have lain and died for what she  cared; and no one would then come near me to nurse me, because they were  afraid of my mistress. This was a great affront. She called her husband  and told him what I had said. He flew into a passion: but did not beat me  then; he only abused and swore at me; and then gave me a note and bade me  go and look for an owner. Not that he meant to sell me; but he did this to  please his wife and to frighten me. I went to Adam White, a cooper, a free  black, who had money, and asked him to buy me. He went directly to Mr.  Wood, but was informed that I was not to be sold. The next day my master  whipped me.    Another time (about five years ago) my mistress got vexed with me, because  I fell sick and I could not keep on with my work. She complained to her  husband, and he sent me off again to look for an owner. I went to a Mr.  Burchell, showed him the note, and asked him to buy me for my own benefit;  for I had saved about 100 dollars, and hoped, with a little help, to  purchase my freedom. He accordingly went to my master:--\"Mr. Wood,\" he  said, \"Molly has brought me a note that she wants an owner. If you intend  to sell her, I may as well buy her as another.\" My master put him off and  said that he did not mean to sell me. I was very sorry at this, for I had  no comfort with Mrs. Wood, and I wished greatly to get my freedom.    The way in which I made my money was this.--When my master and mistress  went from home, as they sometimes did, and left me to take care of the  house and premises, I had a good deal of time to myself, and made the most  of it. I took in washing, and sold coffee and yams and other provisions  to the captains of ships. I did not sit still idling during the absence of  my owners; for I wanted, by all honest means, to earn money to buy my  freedom. Sometimes I bought a hog cheap on board ship, and sold it for  double the money on shore; and I also earned a good deal by selling  coffee. By this means I by degrees acquired a little cash. A gentleman  also lent me some to help to buy my freedom--but when I could not get free  he got it back again. His name was Captain Abbot.    My master and mistress went on one occasion into the country, to Date  Hill, for change of air, and carried me with them to take charge of the  children, and to do the work of the house. While I was in the country, I  saw how the field negroes are worked in Antigua. They are worked very hard  and fed but scantily. They are called out to work before daybreak, and  come home after dark; and then each has to heave his bundle of grass for  the cattle in the pen. Then, on Sunday morning, each slave has to go out  and gather a large bundle of grass; and, when they bring it home, they  have all to sit at the manager's door and wait till he come out: often  have they to wait there till past eleven o'clock, without any breakfast.  After that, those that have yams or potatoes, or fire-wood to sell, hasten  to market to buy a dog's worth[10] of salt fish, or pork, which is a great  treat for them. Some of them buy a little pickle out of the shad barrels,  which they call sauce, to season their yams and Indian corn. It is very  wrong, I know, to work on Sunday or go to market; but will not God call  the Buckra men to answer for this on the great day of judgment--since they  will give the slaves no other day?    [Footnote 10: A dog is the 72nd part of a dollar.]    While we were at Date Hill Christmas came; and the slave woman who had the  care of the place (which then belonged to Mr. Roberts the marshal), asked  me to go with her to her husband's house, to a Methodist meeting for  prayer, at a plantation called Winthorps. I went; and they were the first  prayers I ever understood. One woman prayed; and then they all sung a  hymn; then there was another prayer and another hymn; and then they all  spoke by turns of their own griefs as sinners. The husband of the woman I  went with was a black driver. His name was Henry. He confessed that he had  treated the slaves very cruelly; but said that he was compelled to obey  the orders of his master. He prayed them all to forgive him, and he prayed  that God would forgive him. He said it was a horrid thing for a ranger[11]  to have sometimes to beat his own wife or sister; but he must do so if  ordered by his master.    [Footnote 11: The head negro of an estate--a person who has the chief  superintendence under the manager.]    I felt sorry for my sins also. I cried the whole night, but I was too much  ashamed to speak. I prayed God to forgive me. This meeting had a great  impression on my mind, and led my spirit to the Moravian church; so that  when I got back to town, I went and prayed to have my name put down in the  Missionaries' book; and I followed the church earnestly every opportunity.  I did not then tell my mistress about it; for I knew that she would not  give me leave to go. But I felt I _must_ go. Whenever I carried the  children their lunch at school, I ran round and went to hear the teachers.    The Moravian ladies (Mrs. Richter, Mrs. Olufsen, and Mrs. Sauter) taught  me to read in the class; and I got on very fast. In this class there were  all sorts of people, old and young, grey headed folks and children; but  most of them were free people. After we had done spelling, we tried to  read in the Bible. After the reading was over, the missionary gave out a  hymn for us to sing. I dearly loved to go to the church, it was so solemn.  I never knew rightly that I had much sin till I went there. When I found  out that I was a great sinner, I was very sorely grieved, and very much  frightened. I used to pray God to pardon my sins for Christ's sake, and  forgive me for every thing I had done amiss; and when I went home to my  work, I always thought about what I had heard from the missionaries, and  wished to be good that I might go to heaven. After a while I was admitted  a candidate for the holy Communion.--I had been baptized long before this,  in August 1817, by the Rev. Mr. Curtin, of the English Church, after I had  been taught to repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. I wished at that  time to attend a Sunday School taught by Mr. Curtin, but he would not  receive me without a written note from my master, granting his permission.  I did not ask my owner's permission, from the belief that it would be  refused; so that I got no farther instruction at that time from the  English Church.[12]    [Footnote 12: She possesses a copy of Mrs. Trimmer's \"Charity School  Spelling Book,\" presented to her by the Rev. Mr. Curtin, and dated August  30, 1817. In this book her name is written \"Mary, Princess of Wales\"--an  appellation which, she says, was given her by her owners. It is a common  practice with the colonists to give ridiculous names of this description  to their slaves; being, in fact, one of the numberless modes of expressing  the habitual contempt with which they regard the negro race.--In printing  this narrative we have retained Mary's paternal name of Prince.--_Ed._]    Some time after I began to attend the Moravian Church, I met with Daniel  James, afterwards my dear husband. He was a carpenter and cooper to his  trade; an honest, hard-working, decent black man, and a widower. He had  purchased his freedom of his mistress, old Mrs. Baker, with money he had  earned whilst a slave. When he asked me to marry him, I took time to  consider the matter over with myself, and would not say yes till he went  to church with me and joined the Moravians. He was very industrious after  he bought his freedom; and he had hired a comfortable house, and had  convenient things about him. We were joined in marriage, about Christmas  1826, in the Moravian Chapel at Spring Gardens, by the Rev. Mr. Olufsen.  We could not be married in the English Church. English marriage is not  allowed to slaves; and no free man can marry a slave woman.    When Mr. Wood heard of my marriage, he flew into a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#6)"],[1,"hite, 22.3 per  cent of soda poplar, and 61.2 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 22 per  cent of clay, sized with 1.38 per cent of resin size, given a hard brush  for one hour, tinted very strongly, and pumped to the stock chest. This  stock was beaten to a greater extent than in previous runs. The stock  was run on the paper machine at a speed of 75 feet per minute, using a  medium Jordan brush, and no trouble whatsoever was experienced. Not over  2 pounds of \"broke\" was produced during the whole run, and that was in  the \"threading\" of the machine. The color of the sheet is entirely  satisfactory for many uses. The wood shives apparently were reduced to a  satisfactory degree. Experienced paper makers commented very favorably  on the running of this furnish and the quality of the paper produced.    Run No. 144 was intended as a duplicate of run No. 143. Stock from cooks  Nos. 317 and 318 was given a medium brush and washing for one hour and a  further medium brush of one hour, bleached with 11.4 per cent of bleach,  and made into a furnish composed of 15.5 per cent of sulphite, 23.5 per  cent of soda poplar, and 61 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 21.4 per  cent of clay, sized with 1.17 per cent of resin size, hard brushed for  one hour, tinted by the expert colorer of the company, and pumped to the  stock chest. Stock from cooks Nos. 319 and 320 was treated in exactly  the same manner except that the stock was bleached with 12.1 per cent of  bleach and pumped to the stock chest to mix with the former furnish. The  stock acted very well on the machine, which was speeded to 75 feet per  minute, with the Jordan refiner set at a medium brush. The sheet is as  good, if not better, than that of run No. 143, and it is also a good  illustration of the extent to which proper tinting will enhance the  general appearance of a paper. The poor appearance of the samples of  previous runs is due largely to lack of proper tinting. Various degrees  of whiteness, however, are demanded by the trade.      =COMPARISON OF THE TESTS AND COMMERCIAL PRACTICE.=    In work of this nature and on this scale it is practically impossible to  arrive at a cost figure which would be susceptible of commercial  interpretation, and in this preliminary publication nothing will be  attempted beyond a comparison of the process used with the hurds with  that process commercially applied to poplar wood. The process last used  with the hurds should not be regarded as final, satisfactory, or most  suitable, as it has been shown that progress was being made up to the  conclusion of the work.    In comparing the method of using hurds with the method of handling  poplar wood, a difference is apparent on the delivery of raw material at  the mill. Ordinarily, poplar is received at the mill in the form of logs  about 4 feet in length, which may be stored in piles in the open. Hurds  very likely would be received baled, and it would seem advisable to  store them under cover for the following reasons: (_a_) Baled hurds  would probably absorb and retain more water during wet weather than logs  of wood, thereby causing excessive dilution of the caustic liquor; (_b_)  prolonged excessive dampness might create heating and deterioration  unless the hemp were properly retted; (_c_) wet hurds could not be  sieved free from sand and chaff. Should further work show that the first  two reasons need not be taken into consideration, the third objection  might be overcome by sieving the hurds before baling. Even then, it is  probable that baled hurds stored in the open would accumulate and retain  considerable dirt from factory chimneys, locomotives, and wind. Checked  pulp wood exposed in the open invariably suffers from these causes.    In the preparation of the raw material for the digesters there is  likewise considerable difference between hurds and poplar wood. The  former apparently requires only a moderate sieving to remove sand and  chaff, which operation doubtless would require only a small amount of  labor and the installation of some simple machinery of low power  consumption. In preparing poplar for digestion, the 4-foot logs are  chipped by a heavy, comparatively expensive chipper of high power  consumption, after which the chips are sorted by sieving, the large  pieces being rechipped. There would be a noteworthy difference in the  installation, operating, and depreciation costs of the two equipments,  and this difference would counterbalance to a considerable extent the  difference in cost of raw material storage.    It is possible that in the use of the chip loft more care would have to  be exercised in using hurds because of the tendency of the bast fiber to  cause lodgments, but this should not be considered a serious difficulty.    The weight of hurds which are capable of being charged into a rotary is  a decidedly unfavorable factor. The weight of a cubic foot of hurds  varies somewhat with the proportion of bast fiber, but averages about  5.4 pounds, which, compared with a cubic foot of poplar chips at 8.93  pounds, represents a digester charge of 60.5 per cent of the weight of  a poplar-wood charge, or, in terms of fiber capacity, the hurds charge  would yield 38.6 per cent as much fiber as the wood charge. The hurds  upon being baled for transportation may be broken and crushed to such a  degree that the weight of the charge may be increased, and it might be  found possible to increase the charge weight by steaming or by the  employment of tamping devices. This small weight of charge constitutes  one of the most serious objections to the use of hurds in paper  manufacture.    In those tests in which the most satisfactory results were obtained, the  cooking conditions were 29.5 per cent of caustic soda at a concentration  of 107 grams per liter and a causticity of 84.0 per cent acting at a  temperature of 170 deg. C. for five hours, or a total time of seven hours.  The steam condensation in the rotary used for these tests was abnormally  high, due to the fact that the steam supply pipe was uncovered for a  considerable distance and the rotary was entirely uncovered. It is  believed, therefore, that a larger amount of caustic was necessary than  would otherwise have been the case. This belief is strengthened by the  quality of the waste liquor from one of the later cooks, which gave on  analysis 16.85 grams per liter of free caustic soda and showed a  causticity of 27.75 per cent. These data show that only 67.3 per cent of  the total caustic employed was actually consumed in the cooking  operation, which percentage is lower than obtains in practice. The stock  from this cook was bleached with 11.5 per cent of bleach. But even as  the figures stand, the comparison with poplar cooking practice is as  follows: 29.5 per cent caustic soda used as against 22 to 25 per cent;  107 grams per liter as against 100 to 110; 84 per cent causticity is  little different than obtains in practice; 170 deg. C. is about commercial  practice; five hours at pressure as against four to six hours; seven  hours' total time as against possibly six to eight hours; 11.5 per cent  bleach as against 8 to 10 per cent. Thus, it is evident that the cooking  conditions employed were slightly more severe and expensive than those  in commercial use with poplar wood.    The yield of total fiber obtained from the hurds may be placed at 35 per  cent of bone-dry fiber calculated on the bone-dry weight of hurds used,  or 33.1 per cent of air-dry fiber calculated on air-dry hurds. The yield  of bleached fiber was not determined in this preliminary work, but may  be safely estimated as 30 per cent, which is low when compared with a  yield of about 47 per cent of bone-dry bleached fiber from bone-dry  poplar wood. It is believed quite possible that satisfactory cooking  conditions may be found which will give a higher yield than was obtained  during these tests. The stock should be classed as easy bleaching, and  11.4 per cent of bleach is a satisfactory figure, although a little  high.    As to beating cost, in the last two and most satisfactory tests the  total washing and beating time was three hours, which may be about an  hour more than ordinarily is used in making papers of this grade,  although the practice varies to a considerable extent.    In regard to furnish, there is such a diversity of practice that it is  difficult to make a comparison, but if the hurd stock can be produced as  cheaply as soda-poplar stock, the furnish used in these last two tests  should be regarded as satisfactory to the book and printing paper  manufacturer.    The finish of the paper was not all that might be desired, but that was  due almost entirely to the calender stack available for the work, which  was composed of nine light rolls, many of which were about 6 inches in  diameter and which had not been reground for some time. From a small  test on a large calender stack it was readily shown that the paper  produced is capable of taking a satisfactory finish.    This comparison, satisfactory in many respects, develops two factors  which are decidedly unfavorable to hemp hurds, namely, raw-material  storage and digester capacity, and they must be taken into full account  in considering the paper-making value of this material, although it  should be recognized that investigation may result in the material  improvement of these conditions. Moreover, it is not at all improbable  that further investigation would develop more satisfactory treating  conditions and more suitable furnish compositions, and the belief in  this possibility is strengthened by the fact that material progress was  being made at the conclusion of this preliminary work.    Calculations on the raw material and acreage for a permanent supply for  a pulp mill producing 25 tons of fiber a day for 300 days per annum, or  7,500 tons per annum, give the comparison between hurds and wood shown  in Table II.
