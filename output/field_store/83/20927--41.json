No cat coming out and  the mewing still continuing, I knelt down and peered under the sofa.  There was no cat there. Had it been night I should have been very much  afraid, but I could scarcely reconcile myself to the idea of ghosts  with the room filled with sunshine. Resuming my seat I went on with my  writing, but not for long. The mewing grew nearer. I distinctly heard  something crawl out from under the sofa; there was then a pause, during  which you could have heard the proverbial pin fall, and then something  sprang upon me and dug its claws in my knees. I looked down, and to my  horror and distress, perceived, standing on its hind-legs, pawing my  clothes, a large, tabby cat, without a head--the neck terminating in a  mangled stump. The sight so appalled me that I don't know what happened,  but nurse and the children came in and found me lying on the floor in  hysterics. Can't we leave the house at once?'    \"_Wednesday, November 30th._--Left No. ---- Lower Seedley Road at 2 p.m.  Had an awful scurry to get things packed in time, and dread opening  certain of the packing-cases lest we shall find all the crockery  smashed. Just as we were starting Delia cried out that she had left her  reticule behind, and I was despatched in search of it. I searched  everywhere--till I was worn out, for I know what Delia is--and was  leaving the premises in full anticipation of being sent back again, when  there was a loud commotion in the hall, just as if a dog had suddenly  pounced on a cat, and the next moment a large tabby, with the head hewn  away as Delia had described, rushed up to me and tried to spring on to  my shoulders. At this juncture one of the servants cautiously opened the  hall door from without, and informed me I was wanted. The cat instantly  vanished, and, on my reaching the carriage in a state of breathless  haste and trepidation, Delia told me she had found her reticule--she had  been sitting on it all the time!\"    In a subsequent note in his diary a year or so later Mr. Dane says:  \"After innumerable enquiries _re_ the history of No. ---- Lower Seedley  Road prior to our inhabiting it, I have at length elicited the fact that  twelve years ago a Mr. and Mrs. Barlowe lived there. They had one son,  Arthur, whom they spoilt in the most outrageous fashion, even to the  extent of encouraging him in acts of cruelty. To afford him amusement  they used to buy rats for his dog--a fox-terrier--to worry, and on one  occasion procured a stray cat, which the servants afterwards declared  was mangled in the most shocking manner before being finally destroyed  by Arthur. Here, then, in my opinion, is a very feasible explanation for  the hauntings--the phenomenon seen was the phantasm of the poor,  tortured cat. For if human tragedies are re-enacted by ghosts, why not  animal tragedies too? It is absurd to suppose man has the monopoly of  soul or spirit.\"      _The Cat on the Post_    In her _Ghosts and Family Legends_ Mrs. Crowe narrates the following  case of a haunting by the phantom of a cat:--    \"After the doctor's story, I fear mine will appear too trifling,\" said  Mrs. M., \"but as it is the only circumstance of the kind that ever  happened to myself, I prefer giving it you to any of the many stories I  have heard.    \"About fifteen years ago I was staying with some friends at a  magnificent old seat in Yorkshire, and our host being very much crippled  with the gout, was in the habit of driving about the park and  neighbourhood in a low pony phaeton, on which occasions I often  accompanied him. One of our favourite excursions was to the ruins of an  old abbey just beyond the park, and we generally returned by a  remarkably pretty rural lane leading to the village, or rather small  town, of C----.    \"One fine summer's evening we had just entered this lane when, seeing  the hedges full of wild flowers, I asked my friend to let me alight and  gather some. I walked before the carriage picking honeysuckles and roses  as I went along, till I came to a gate that led into a field. It was a  common country gate with a post on each side, and on one of these posts  sat a large white cat, the finest animal of the kind I had ever seen;  and as I have a weakness for cats I stopped to admire this sleek, fat  puss, looking so wonderfully comfortable in a very uncomfortable  position, the top of the post, on which it was sitting with its feet  doubled up under it, being out of all proportion to its body, for no  Angola ever rivalled it in size.    \"'Come on gently,' I called to my friend; 'here's such a magnificent  cat!' for I feared the approach of the phaeton would startle it away  before he had seen it.    \"'Where?' said he, pulling up his horse opposite the gate.    \"'There,' said I, pointing to the post. 'Isn't he a beauty? I wonder if  it would let me stroke it?'    \"'I see no cat,' said he.    \"'There on the post,' said I, but he declared he saw nothing, though  puss sat there in perfect composure during this colloquy.    \"'Don't you see the cat, James?' said I in great perplexity to the  groom.    \"'Yes, ma'am; a large white cat on that post.'    \"I thought my friend must be joking, or losing his eyesight, and I  approached the cat, intending to take it in my arms and carry it to the  carriage; but as I drew near she jumped off the post, which was natural  enough, but to my surprise she jumped into nothing--as she jumped she  disappeared! No cat in the field--none in the lane--none in the ditch!    \"'Where did she go, James?'    \"'I don't know, ma'am. I can't see her,' said the groom, standing up in  his seat and looking all round.    \"I was quite bewildered; but still I had no glimmering of the truth; and  when I got into the carriage again my friend said he thought I and James  were dreaming, and I retorted that I thought he must be going blind.    \"I had a commission to execute as we passed through the town, and I  alighted for that purpose at the little haberdasher's; and while they  were serving me I mentioned that I had seen a remarkably beautiful cat  sitting on a gate in the lane, and asked if they could tell me who it  belonged to, adding it was the largest cat I ever saw.    \"The owners of the shop, and two women who were making purchases,  suspended their proceedings, looked at each other and then looked at me,  evidently very much surprised.    \"'Was it a white cat, ma'am?' said the mistress.    \"'Yes, a white cat; a beautiful creature and----'    \"'Bless me!' cried two or three, 'the lady's seen the white cat of  C----. It hasn't been seen these twenty years.'    \"'Master wishes to know if you'll soon be done, ma'am. The pony is  getting restless,' said James.    \"Of course I hurried out, and got into the carriage, telling my friend  that the cat was well known to the people at C----, and that it was  twenty years old.    \"In those days, I believe, I never thought of ghosts, and least of all  should have thought of the ghost of a cat; but two evenings afterwards,  as we were driving down the lane, I again saw the cat in the same  position and again my companion could not see it, though the groom did.  I alighted immediately, and went up to it. As I approached it turned its  head and looked full towards me with its soft mild eyes, and a friendly  expression, like that of a loving dog; and then, without moving from the  post, it began to fade gradually away, as if it were a vapour, till it  had quite disappeared. All this the groom saw as well as myself; and now  there could be no mistake as to what it was. A third time I saw it in  broad daylight, and my curiosity greatly awakened, I resolved to make  further enquiries amongst the inhabitants of C----, but before I had an  opportunity of doing so, I was summoned away by the death of my eldest  child, and I have never been in that part of the world since.    \"However, I once mentioned the circumstance to a lady who was acquainted  with that neighbourhood, and she said she had heard of the white cat of  C----, but had never seen it.\"    This is Mrs. M.'s account as related by Mrs. Crowe, and after perusing  the authoress's preface to the work, I am inclined to give it full  credence.      _The Mystic Properties of Cats_    The most common forms of animal phenomena seen in haunted houses are  undoubtedly those of cats. The number of places reported to me as being  haunted by cats is almost incredible--in one street in Whitechapel there  are no less than four. This state of affairs may possibly be accounted  for by the fact that cats, more than any other animals that live in  houses, meet with sudden and unnatural ends, especially in the poorer  districts, where the doctrine of kindness to animals has not as yet made  itself thoroughly felt. Now I am touching on the subject of cat ghosts,  it may not be out of place to reproduce the following article of mine,  entitled \"Cats and the Unknown,\" which appeared in the _Occult Review_  for December, 1912:--    \"Since, from all ages, the cat has been closely associated with the  supernatural, it is not surprising to learn that images and symbols of  that animal figured in the temples of the sun and moon, respectively, in  ancient Egypt. According to Horapollo, the cat was worshipped in the  Temple of Heliopolis, sacred to the sun, because the size of the pupil  of the cat's eye is regulated by the height of the sun above the  horizon.    \"Other authorities suggest a rather more subtle--and, in my opinion,  more probable--reason, namely, that the link between the sun and the cat  is not merely physical but superphysical, that the cat is attracted to  the sun not only because it loves warmth, but because the sun keeps off  terrifying and antagonistic occult forces, to the influences of which  the cat, above all other animals, is specially susceptible; a fact fully  recognized by the Egyptians, who, to show their understanding and  appreciation of this feline attachment, took care that whenever "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#6)"],[1,"Provinces the king-crows appear to be as  numerous in winter as in summer: in the Punjab they are very plentiful  in summer, but rare in the cold weather; while not a single king-crow  winters in the N.-W. Frontier Province.    Of the birds of which the nests were described in January and February  the Pallas's fishing eagles have sent their nestlings into the world  to fend for themselves.    In the case of the following birds the breeding season is fast drawing  to its close:--the dusky horned-owl, the white-backed vulture,  Bonelli's eagle, the tawny eagle, the brown fish-owl, the rock  horned-owl, the raven, the amadavat and the white-throated munia.    The nesting season is at its height for all the other birds of which  the nests have been described, namely, most species of dove, the  jungle crow, the red-headed merlin, the purple sunbird, the nuthatch,  the fantail flycatcher, the finch-lark, the pied woodpecker, the  coppersmith, the alexandrine and the rose-ringed paroquet, the  white-eyed buzzard, the collared scops and the mottled wood-owl, the  kite, the black vulture and the pied kingfisher.    The sand-martins breed from October to May, consequently their nests,  containing eggs or young, are frequently taken in March. Mention was  made in January and February of the Indian cliff-swallow (_Hirundo  fluvicola_). This species is not found in the eastern districts of the  United Provinces, but it is the common swallow of the western  districts. The head is dull chestnut. The back and shoulders are  glistening steel-blue. The remainder of the upper plumage is brown.  The lower parts are white with brown streaks, which are most apparent  on the throat and upper breast. These swallows normally nest at two  seasons of the year--from February till April and in July or August.    They breed in colonies. The mud nests are spherical or oval with an  entrance tube from two to six inches long. The nests are invariably  attached to a cliff or building, and, although isolated ones are built  sometimes, they usually occur in clusters, as many as two hundred have  been counted in one cluster. In such a case a section cut parallel to  the surface to which the nests are attached looks like that of a huge  honeycomb composed of cells four inches in diameter--cells of a kind  that one could expect to be built by bees that had partaken of Mr. H.  G. Wells' \"food of the gods.\"    The beautiful white-breasted kingfisher, (_Halcyon smyrnensis_) is now  busy at its nest.    This species spends most of its life in shady gardens; it feeds on  insects in preference to fish. It does not invariably select a river  bank in which to nest, it is quite content with a sand quarry, a bank,  or the shaft of a _kachcha_ well. The nest consists of a passage, some  two feet in length and three inches in diameter, leading to a larger  chamber in which from four to seven eggs are laid.    A pair of white-breasted kingfishers at work during the early stages  of nest construction affords an interesting spectacle. Not being able  to obtain a foothold on the almost perpendicular surface of the bank,  the birds literally charge this in turn with fixed beak. By a  succession of such attacks at one spot a hole of an appreciable size  is soon formed in the soft sand. Then the birds are able to obtain a  foothold and to excavate with the bill, while clinging to the edge of  the hole. Every now and then they indulge in a short respite from  their labours. While thus resting one of the pair will sometimes  spread its wings for an instant and display the white patch; then it  will close them and make a neat bow, as if to say \"Is not that nice?\"  Its companion may remain motionless and unresponsive, or may return  the compliment.    In the first days of March the bulbuls begin to breed. In 1912 the  writer saw a pair of bulbuls (_Otocompsa emeria_) building a nest on  the 3rd March. By the 10th the structure was complete and held the  full clutch of three eggs. On that date a second nest was found  containing three eggs.    In 1913 the writer first saw a bulbul's nest on the 5th March. This  belonged to _Molpastes bengalensis_ and contained two eggs. On the  following day the full clutch of three was in the nest.    The nesting season for these birds terminates in the rains.    The common bulbuls of the plains belong to two genera--_Molpastes_ and  _Otocompsa_. The former is split up into a number of local species  which display only small differences in appearance and interbreed  freely at the places where they meet. They are known as the Madras,  the Bengal, the Punjab, etc., red-vented bulbul. They are somewhat  larger than sparrows. The head, which bears a short crest, and the  face are black; the rest of the body, except a patch of bright red  under the tail, is brown, each feather having a pale margin.    In _Otocompsa_ the crest is long and rises to a sharp point which  curves forward a little over the beak. The breast is white, set off by  a black gorget. There is the usual red patch under the tail and a  patch of the same hue on each side of the face, whence the English  name for the bird--the red-whiskered bulbul.    _Molpastes_ and _Otocompsa_ have similar habits. They are feckless  little birds that build cup-shaped nests in all manner of queer and  exposed situations. Those that live near the habitations of Europeans  nestle in low bushes in the garden, or in pot plants in the verandah.  Small crotons are often selected, preferably those that do not bear a  score of leaves. The sitting bulbul does not appear to mind the daily  shower-bath it receives when the _mali_ waters the plant. Sometimes as  many as three or four pairs of bulbuls attempt to rear up families in  one verandah. The word \"attempt\" is used advisedly, because, owing to  the exposed situations in which nests are built, large numbers of eggs  and young bulbuls are destroyed by boys, cats, snakes and other  predaceous creatures. The average bulbul loses six broods for every  one it succeeds in rearing. The eggs are pink with reddish markings.    March is the month in which to look for the nest of the Indian  wren-warbler (_Prinia inornata_). _Inornata_ is a very appropriate  specific name for this tiny earth-brown bird, which is devoid of all  kind of ornamentation. Its voice is as homely as its appearance--a  harsh but plaintive _twee_, _twee_, _twee_. It weaves a nest which  looks like a ragged loofah with a hole in the side. The nest is  usually placed low down in a bush or in long grass. Sometimes it is  attached to two or more stalks of corn. In such cases the corn is  often cut before the young birds have had time to leave the nest, and  then the brood perishes. This species brings up a second family in the  rainy season.    The barn-owls (_Strix flammea_) are now breeding. They lay their eggs  in cavities in trees, buildings or walls. In northern India the  nesting season lasts from February to June. Eggs are most likely to be  found in the United Provinces during the present month.    The various species of babblers or seven sisters begin to nest in  March. Unlike bulbuls these birds are careful to conceal the nest.  This is a slenderly-built, somewhat untidy cup, placed in a bush or  tree. The eggs are a beautiful rich blue, without any markings.    The hawk-cuckoo, or brain-fever bird (_Hierococcyx varius_), to which  allusion has already been made, deposits its eggs in the nests of  various species of babblers. The eggs of this cuckoo are blue, but are  distinguishable from those of the babbler by their larger size. It may  be noted, in passing, that this cuckoo does not extend far into the  Punjab.    As stated above, most of the shrikes go a-courting in March.  Nest-building follows hard on courtship. In this month and in April  most of the shrikes lay their eggs, but nests containing eggs or young  are to be seen in May, June, July and August. Shrikes are birds of  prey in miniature. Although not much larger than sparrows they are as  fierce as falcons.    Their habit is to seize the quarry on the ground, after having pounced  upon it from a bush or tree. Grasshoppers constitute their usual food,  but they are not afraid to tackle mice or small birds.    The largest shrike is the grey species (_Lanius lahtora_). This is  clothed mainly in grey; however, it has a broad black band running  through the eye--the escutcheon of the butcher-bird clan. It begins  nesting before the other species, and its eggs are often taken in  February.    The other common species are the bay-backed (_L. vittatus_) and the  rufous-backed shrike (_L. erythronotus_). These are smaller birds and  have the back red. The former is distinguishable from the latter by  having in the wings and tail much white, which is very conspicuous  during flight.    The nest of each species is a massive cup, composed of twigs, thorns,  grasses, feathers, and, usually, some pieces of rag; these last often  hang down in a most untidy manner. The nest is, as a rule, placed in a  babool or other thorny tree, close up against the trunk.    Three allies of the shrikes are likewise busy with their nests at this  season. These are the wood-shrike, the minivet and the cuckoo-shrike.  The wood-shrike (_Tephrodornis pondicerianus_) is an ashy-brown bird  of the size of a sparrow with a broad white eyebrow. It frequently  emits a characteristic soft, melancholy, whistling note, which Eha  describes as \"Be thee cheery.\" How impracticable are all efforts to  \"chain by syllables airy sounds\"! The cup-like nest of this species is  always carefully concealed in a tree.    Minivets are aerial exquisites. In descriptions of them superlative  follows upon superlative. The cocks of most species are arrayed in  scarlet and black; the hens are not a whit less brilliantly attired in  yellow and sable. One species lives entirely in the plains, others  visit them in the cold weather; the majority are permanent residents"]]]
