The festival of  the Genius was naturally the master's birthday, and on that day slaves  and freedmen kept holiday with the family and brought offerings to the  _Genius domus_. It is a significant fact, and may serve to bring out  the underlying notion, that in later paintings, when anthropomorphism  and sensuous representation held sway over all Roman religion, though  the other gods of the household were depicted after the manner of Greek  deities, the Genius is either represented by his symbolic snake or  appears with the human features and characteristics of the head of the  house, his owner.    The spirit-gods then of the door and the hearth, the specially chosen  deities of the store-cupboard, the particular field-power presiding  over the household, and the spirit of the master's personality were the  gods of the early home, and round their worship centred the domestic  religion. We must attempt to see what was its relation to family life.    =2. Religion and the Family Life.=--We have already noticed the main  occasions of regular sacrifice to the deities of the household, the  offerings to the Lar on Calends, Nones, and Ides, to the Genius on the  master's birthday, and so on, and we are enabled to form a fair picture  of the rites from paintings which, although of later date, undoubtedly  represent the continuous tradition of domestic custom. In a  wall-painting at Herculaneum, for instance, we have a picture of the  _pater familias_, represented with veiled head (according to regular  Roman custom) and the cornucopia of the Genius, making sacrifice at a  round altar or hearth. Opposite him stands the flute-player (_tibicen_)  playing to drown any unpropitious sound, while on either side are two  smaller figures, presumably the sons, acting as attendants (_camilli_),  and both clad (_succincti_) in the short sacrificial tunic (_limus_);  one carries in his left hand the sacred dish (_patera_), and in his  right garlands or, more probably, ribbons for the decoration of the  victim: the other is acting as _victimarius_ and bringing the pig for  sacrifice, but the animal is hurrying with almost excessive eagerness  towards the altar, no doubt to show that there is none of the  reluctance which would have been sufficient to vitiate the sacrifice.    But from our point of view such formal acts of worship are of less  importance than the part played by religion in the daily life of the  household. There is evidence both for earlier and later periods that  the really 'pious' would begin their day with prayer and sacrifice to  the household gods, and like Virgil's Aeneas, typically _pius_ in all  the meanings of the word, would 'rouse the slumbering flame upon the  altar and gladly approach again the Lar and little Penates whom he  worshipped yesterday.' But this was perhaps exceptional devotion, and  the daily worship in the normal household centred rather round the  family meal. In the old and simple house the table would be placed at  the side of the hearth, and, as the household sat round it, master and  man together, a part of the meal, set aside on a special sacred dish  (_patella_), would be thrown into the flames as the gods' portion.  Sometimes incense might be added, and later a libation of wine: when  images had become common, the little statuettes of Lares and Penates  would be fetched from the shrine (_lararium_) and placed upon the table  in token of their presence at the meal. Even in the luxurious,  many-roomed house of the imperial epoch, when the dining-table was far  from the kitchen-hearth, a pause was made in the meal and an offering  sent out to the household-gods, nor would the banquet proceed until the  slave had returned and announced that the gods were favourable (_deos  propitios_): so persistent was this tradition of domestic piety. Prayer  might be made at this point on special occasions to special deities,  as, for instance, before the beginning of the sowing of the crops,  appeal was made to Iuppiter, and a special portion of the meal (_daps_)  was set aside for him. The sanctification of the one occasion when the  whole household met in the day cannot fail to have had its effect on  the domestic life, and, even if it was no direct incentive to morality,  it yet bound the family together in a sense of dependence on a higher  power for the supply of their daily needs.    We observed incidentally how the small events of domestic life were  given their religious significance, particularly in connection with the  worship of Lar and Genius, but to complete the sketch of domestic  religion, we must examine a little more closely its relation to the  process of life, and especially to the two important occasions of birth  and marriage. In no department of life is the specialisation of  function among the _numina_ more conspicuous than in connection with  birth and childhood. Apart from the general protection of Iuno Lucina,  the prominent divinity of childbirth, we can count in the records that  have come down to us some twenty subordinate spirits, who from the  moment of conception to the moment of birth watched, each in its own  particular sphere, over the mother and the unborn child. As soon as the  birth had taken place began a series of ceremonies, which are of  particular interest, as they seem to belong to a very early stage of  religious thought, and have a markedly rustic character. Immediately a  sacred meal was offered to the two field-deities, Picumnus and  Pilumnus, and then the Roman turned his attention to the practical  danger of fever for the mother and child. At night three men gathered  round the threshold, one armed with an axe, another with a stake, and a  third with a broom: the two first struck the threshold with their  implements, the third swept out the floor. Over this ceremony were said  to preside three _numina_, Intercidona (connected with the axe),  Pilumnus (connected with the stake, _pilum_), and Deverra (connected  with the act of sweeping). Its object was, as Varro explains it, to  avert the entrance of the half-wild Silvanus by giving three  unmistakeable signs of human civilisation; we shall probably not be  wrong in seeing in it rather an actual hacking, beating, and sweeping  away of evil spirits. On the ninth day after birth, in the case of a  boy, on the eighth in the case of a girl, occurred the festival of the  naming (_solemnitas nominalium_). The ceremony was one of purification  (_dies lustricus_ is its alternative title), and a piacular offering  was made to preserve the child from evil influences in the future.  Friends brought presents, especially neck-bands in the form of a  half-moon (_lunulae_), and the golden balls (_bullae_) which were worn  as a charm round the neck until the attainment of manhood.    Of the numerous petty divinities which watched over the child's early  years we have already given some account. In their protection he  remained until he arrived at puberty, about the age of seventeen, when  with due religious ceremony he entered on his manhood. At home, on the  morning of the festival, he solemnly laid aside the _bulla_ and the  purple-striped garb of childhood (_toga praetexta_) before the shrine  of the household gods, and made them a thank-offering for their  protection in the past. Afterwards, accompanied by his father and  friends and clad now in the _toga virilis_, he went solemnly to the  Capitol, and, after placing a contribution in the coffers of  Iuventas--or probably in earlier times of Iuppiter Iuventus--made an  offering to the supreme deity Iuppiter Capitolinus. The sacred  character of the early years of a young Roman's life could hardly be  more closely marked.    Though _confarreatio_ was the only essentially religious form of  marriage, and was sanctified by the presence of the _pontifex maximus_  and the _flamen Dialis_, yet marriage even in the less religious  ceremony of _coemptio_ was always a _sacrum_. It must not take place on  the days of state-festivals (_feriae_), nor on certain other _dies  religiosi_, such as those of the Vestalia or the feast of the dead  (_Parentalia_). Both the marriage itself and the preliminary betrothal  (_sponsalia_) had to receive the divine sanction by means of auspices,  and in the ceremonies of both rites the religious element, though bound  up with superstition and folk-customs, emerges clearly enough. The  central ceremony of the _confarreatio_ was an act partly of sacrifice,  partly, one might almost say, of communion. The bride and bridegroom  sat on two chairs united to one another and covered with a lambskin,  they offered to Iuppiter bloodless offerings of a rustic character  (_fruges et molam salsam_), they employed in the sacrifice the  fundamental household necessaries, water, fire, and salt, and  themselves ate of the sacred spelt-cake (_libus farreus_), from which  the ceremony derived its name. The crucial point in the more civil  ceremony of _coemptio_ was the purely human and legal act of the  joining of hands (_dextrarum iunctio_), but it was immediately followed  by the sacrifice of a victim, which gave the ceremony a markedly  religious significance. The customs connected with the bringing of the  bride to the bridegroom's house--so beautifully depicted in Catullus'  _Epithalamium_--her forcible abduction from her parents, the ribaldry  of the bridegroom's companions, the throwing of nuts as a symbol of  fecundity, the carrying of the bride over the threshold, a relic  probably of primitive marriage by capture, the untying of the bridal  knot on the bridal couch--are perhaps more akin to superstition than  religion, but we may notice two points in the proceedings. Firstly, the  three coins (_asses_) which the bride brought with her, one to give to  her husband as a token of dowry, one to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18571"],[0,"The Northmen, Columbus and Cabot, 985-1503 (#6)"],[1,"to him, saying, that he would be  regarded as a distinguished man wherever he was. She gave him Vifilsdal,  and there he dwelt. He married a woman whose name was...;[15-1] their  sons were Thorbiorn and Thorgeir. They were men of promise, and grew up  with their father.[15-2]    _Eric the Red finds Greenland._--There was a man named Thorvald; he was a  son of Asvald, Ulf's son, Eyxna-Thori's son. His son's name was Eric. He  and his father went from Jaederen[15-3] to Iceland, on account of  manslaughter, and settled on Hornstrandir, and dwelt at Drangar. There  Thorvald died, and Eric then married Thorhild, a daughter of Jorund,  Atli's son, and Thorbiorg the Ship-chested, who had been married before  to Thorbiorn of the Haukadal family. Eric then removed from the North,  and cleared land in Haukadal, and dwelt at Ericsstadir by Vatnshorn. Then  Eric's thralls caused a land-slide on Valthiof's farm, Valthiofsstadir.  Eyiolf the Foul, Valthiof's kinsman, slew the thralls near Skeidsbrekkur  above Vatnshorn. For this Eric killed Eyiolf the Foul, and he also killed  Duelling-Hrafn, at Leikskalar. Geirstein and Odd of Jorva, Eyiolf's  kinsmen, conducted the prosecution for the slaying of their kinsmen, and  Eric was, in consequence, banished from Haukadal. He then took possession  of Brokey and Eyxney, and dwelt at Tradir on Sudrey, the first winter. It  was at this time that he loaned Thorgest his outer dais-boards;[16-1]  Eric afterwards went to Eyxney, and dwelt at Ericsstad. He then demanded  his outer dais-boards, but did not obtain them. Eric then carried the  outer dais-boards away from Breidabolstad, and Thorgest gave chase. They  came to blows a short distance from the farm of Drangar. There two of  Thorgest's sons were killed and certain other men besides. After this  each of them retained a considerable body of men with him at his home.  Styr gave Eric his support, as did also Eyiolf of Sviney, Thorbiorn,  Vifil's son, and the sons of Thorbrand of Alptafirth; while Thorgest was  backed by the sons of Thord the Yeller, and Thorgeir of Hitardal, Aslak  of Langadal and his son, Illugi. Eric and his people were condemned to  outlawry at Thorsness-thing. He equipped his ship for a voyage, in  Ericsvag; while Eyiolf concealed him in Dimunarvag, when Thorgest and his  people were searching for him among the islands. He said to them, that it  was his intention to go in search of that land which Gunnbiorn, son of  Ulf the Crow, saw when he was driven out of his course, westward across  the main, and discovered Gunnbiorns-skerries.[16-2] He told them that he  would return again to his friends, if he should succeed in finding that  country. Thorbiorn, and Eyiolf, and Styr accompanied Eric out beyond the  islands, and they parted with the greatest friendliness; Eric said to  them that he would render them similar aid, so far as it might lie within  his power, if they should ever stand in need of his help. Eric sailed  out to sea from Snaefells-iokul, and arrived at that ice-mountain which  is called Blacksark. Thence he sailed to the southward, that he might  ascertain whether there was habitable country in that direction. He  passed the first winter at Ericsey, near the middle of the Western  Settlement.[17-1] In the following spring he proceeded to Ericsfirth, and  selected a site there for his homestead. That summer he explored the  western uninhabited region, remaining there for a long time, and  assigning many local names there. The second winter he spent at  Ericsholms beyond Hvarfsgnipa. But the third summer he sailed northward  to Snaefell,[17-2] and into Hrafnsfirth. He believed then that he had  reached the head of Ericsfirth; he turned back then, and remained the  third winter at Ericsey at the mouth of Ericsfirth. The following summer  he sailed to Iceland, and landed in Breidafirth. He remained that winter  with Ingolf at Holmlatr. In the spring he and Thorgest fought together,  and Eric was defeated; after this a reconciliation was effected between  them. That summer Eric set out to colonize the land which he had  discovered, and which he called Greenland, because, he said, men would be  the more readily persuaded thither if the land had a good name.[17-3]    _Concerning Thorbiorn._--Thorgeir, Vifil's son, married, and took to wife  Arnora, daughter of Einar of Laugarbrekka, Sigmund's son, son of Ketil  Thistil, who settled Thistilsfirth. Einar had another daughter named  Hallveig; she was married to Thorbiorn, Vifil's son, who got with her  Laugarbrekkaland on Hellisvellir. Thorbiorn moved thither, and became a  very distinguished man. He was an excellent husbandman, and had a great  estate. Gudrid was the name of Thorbiorn's daughter. She was the most  beautiful of her sex, and in every respect a very superior woman. There  dwelt at Arnarstapi a man named Orm, whose wife's name was Halldis. Orm  was a good husbandman, and a great friend of Thorbiorn, and Gudrid lived  with him for a long time as a foster-daughter. There was a man named  Thorgeir, who lived at Thorgeirsfell; he was very wealthy and had been  manumitted; he had a son named Einar, who was a handsome, well-bred man,  and very showy in his dress. Einar was engaged in trading-voyages from  one country to the other, and had prospered in this. He always spent his  winters alternately either in Iceland or in Norway.    Now it is to be told, that one autumn, when Einar was in Iceland, he went  with his wares out along Snaefellsness, with the intention of selling  them. He came to Arnarstapi, and Orm invited him to remain with him, and  Einar accepted this invitation, for there was a strong friendship  [between Orm and himself]. Einar's wares were carried into a store-house,  where he unpacked them, and displayed them to Orm and the men of his  household, and asked Orm to take such of them as he liked. Orm accepted  this offer, and said that Einar was a good merchant, and was greatly  favored by fortune. Now, while they were busied about the wares, a woman  passed before the door of the store-house. Einar inquired of Orm: \"Who  was that handsome woman who passed before the door? I have never seen her  here before.\" Orm replies: \"That, is Gudrid, my foster-child, the  daughter of Thorbiorn of Laugarbrekka.\" \"She must be a good match,\" said  Einar; \"has she had any suitors?\" Orm replies: \"In good sooth she has  been courted, friend, nor is she easily to be won, for it is believed  that both she and her father will be very particular in their choice of a  husband.\" \"Be that as it may,\" quoth Einar, \"she is a woman to whom I  mean to pay my addresses, and I would have thee present this matter to  her father in my behalf, and use every exertion to bring it to a  favorable issue, and I shall reward thee to the full of my friendship, if  I am successful. It may be that Thorbiorn will regard the connection as  being to our mutual advantage, for [while] he is a most honorable man and  has a goodly home, his personal effects, I am told, are somewhat on the  wane; but neither I nor my father are lacking in lands or chattels, and  Thorbiorn would be greatly aided thereby, if this match should be brought  about.\" \"Surely I believe myself to be thy friend,\" replies Orm, \"and yet  I am by no means disposed to act in this matter, for Thorbiorn hath a  very haughty spirit, and is moreover a most ambitious man.\" Einar replied  that he wished for nought else than that his suit should be broached; Orm  replied, that he should have his will. Einar fared again to the South  until he reached his home. Sometime after this, Thorbiorn had an autumn  feast, as was his custom, for he was a man of high position. Hither came  Orm of Arnarstapi, and many other of Thorbiorn's friends. Orm came to  speech with Thorbiorn, and said, that Einar of Thorgeirsfell had visited  him not long before, and that he was become a very promising man. Orm now  makes known the proposal of marriage in Einar's behalf, and added that  for some persons and for some reasons it might be regarded as a very  appropriate match: \"thou mayest greatly strengthen thyself thereby,  master, by reason of the property.\" Thorbiorn answers: \"Little did I  expect to hear such words from thee, that I should marry my daughter to  the son of a thrall; and that, because it seems to thee that my means are  diminishing, wherefore she shall not remain longer with thee since thou  deemest so mean a match as this suitable for her.\" Orm afterward returned  to his home, and all of the invited guests to their respective  households, while Gudrid remained behind with her father, and tarried at  home that winter. But in the spring Thorbiorn gave an entertainment to  his friends, to which many came, and it was a noble feast, and at the  banquet Thorbiorn called for silence, and spoke: \"Here have I passed a  goodly lifetime, and have experienced the good-will of men toward me, and  their affection; and, methinks, our relations together have been  pleasant; but now I begin to find myself in straitened circumstances,  although my estate has hitherto been accounted a respectable one. Now  will I rather abandon my farming, than lose my honor, and rather leave  the country, than bring disgrace upon my family; wherefore I have now  concluded to put that promise to the test, which my friend Eric the Red  made, when we parted company in Breidafirth. It is my present design to  go to Greenland this summer, if matters fare as I wish.\" The folk were  greatly astonished at this plan of Thorbiorn's, for he was blessed with  many friends, but they were convinced that he was so firmly fixed in his  purpose, that it would not avail to endeavor to dissuade him from it.  Thorbiorn bestowed gifts upon his guests, after which the feast came to  an end, and the folk returned to their homes. Thorbiorn sells his lands  and buys a ship, which was laid up at the mouth of Hraunhoefn. Thirty  persons joined him in the voyage; among these were Orm of"]]]
