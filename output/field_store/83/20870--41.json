The Ogre, when he woke, said to his wife: \"Go upstairs and dress those  young rascals who came here last night.\" The Ogress was very much  surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what  manner she should dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to  go up and put on their clothes, she went, and was horrified when she  perceived her seven daughters all dead.    She began by fainting away, as was only natural in such a case. The  Ogre, fearing his wife was too long in doing what he had ordered, went  up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than his wife at this  frightful spectacle.    \"Ah! what have I done?\" cried he. \"The wretches shall pay for it, and  that instantly.\"    He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife's face, and having brought her  to herself, \"Give me quickly,\" cried he, \"my seven-leagued boots, that I  may go and catch them.\"    He went out into the country, and, after running in all directions, he  came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not  above a hundred paces from their father's house. They espied the Ogre,  who went at one step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as  easily as the narrowest brooks. Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near  the place where they were, hid his brothers in it, and crowded into it  himself, watching always what would become of the Ogre.    The Ogre, who found himself tired with his long and fruitless journey  (for these boots of seven leagues greatly taxed the wearer), had a great  mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon the rock in  which the little boys had hidden themselves. As he was worn out with  fatigue, he fell asleep, and, after reposing himself some time, began to  snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him  than when he held up his great knife and was going to take their lives.  Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them  that they should run away at once toward home while the Ogre was asleep  so soundly, and that they need not be in any trouble about him. They  took his advice, and got home quickly.    Little Thumb then went close to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently,  and put them on his own legs. The boots were very long and large, but as  they were fairy boots, they had the gift of becoming big or little,  according to the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his  feet and legs as well as if they had been made for him. He went straight  to the Ogre's house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss  of her murdered daughters.    \"Your husband,\" said Little Thumb, \"is in very great danger, for he has  been taken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does  not give them all his gold and silver. At the very moment they held  their daggers at his throat he perceived me and begged me to come and  tell you the condition he was in, and to say that you should give me all  he has of value, without retaining any one thing; for otherwise they  will kill him without mercy. As his case is very pressing, he desired me  to make use of his seven-leagued boots, which you see I have on, so that  I might make the more haste and that I might show you that I do not  impose upon you.\"    The good woman, being greatly frightened, gave him all she had; for this  Ogre was a very good husband, though he ate up little children. Little  Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to his father's  house, where he was received with abundance of joy.    There are many people who do not agree in regard to this act of Little  Thumb's, and pretend that he never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he  only thought he might very justly take off his seven-leagued boots  because he made no other use of them but to run after little children.  These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, because they  have drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker's house. They declare that  when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre's boots he went to Court, where  he was informed that they were very much in trouble about a certain  army, which was two hundred leagues off, and anxious as to the success  of a battle. He went, they say, to the King and told him that if he  desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night.    The King promised him a great sum of money if he succeeded. Little Thumb  returned that very same night with the news; and, this first expedition  causing him to be known, he earned as much as he wished, for the King  paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army. Many ladies  employed him also to carry messages, from which he made much money.  After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger and  gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his father, and it is  impossible to express the joy of his family. He placed them all in  comfortable circumstances, bought places for his father and brothers,  and by that means settled them very handsomely in the world, while he  successfully continued to make his own way.          THE MASTER CAT, OR PUSS IN BOOTS.      Once upon a time there was a miller who left no more riches to the three  sons he had than his mill, his ass, and his cat. The division was soon  made. Neither the lawyer nor the attorney was sent for. They would soon  have eaten up all the poor property. The eldest had the mill, the second  the ass, and the youngest nothing but the cat.    The youngest, as we can understand, was quite unhappy at having so poor  a share.    \"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough by  joining their stocks together; but, for my part, when I have eaten up my  cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.\"    The Cat, who heard all this, without appearing to take any notice, said  to him with a grave and serious air:--    \"Do not thus afflict yourself, my master; you have nothing else to do  but to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may  scamper through the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so  poor a portion in me as you think.\"    Though the Cat's master did not think much of what he said, he had seen  him play such cunning tricks to catch rats and mice--hanging himself by  the heels, or hiding himself in the meal, to make believe he was  dead--that he did not altogether despair of his helping him in his  misery. When the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very  gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it  in his two forepaws, and went into a warren where was a great number of  rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and, stretching out  at length, as if he were dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet  acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag  for what he had put into it.    Scarcely was he settled but he had what he wanted. A rash and foolish  young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing  close the strings, took him and killed him at once. Proud of his prey,  he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with the King. He was  shown upstairs into his Majesty's apartment, and, making a low bow to  the King, he said:--    \"I have brought you, sire, a rabbit which my noble Lord, the Master of  Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his  master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"    \"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that I am  pleased with his gift.\"    Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, still  holding his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he  drew the strings, and so caught them both. He then went and made a  present of these to the King, as he had done before of the rabbit which  he took in the warren. The King, in like manner, received the partridges  with great pleasure, and ordered his servants to reward him.    The Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his Majesty,  from time to time, some of his master's game. One day when he knew that  the King was to take the air along the riverside, with his daughter, the  most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master:--    \"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made. You have nothing  else to do but go and bathe in the river, just at the spot I shall show  you, and leave the rest to me.\"    The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing  what could be the use of doing it. While he was bathing, the King passed  by, and the Cat cried out with all his might:--    \"Help! help! My Lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!\"    At this noise the King put his head out of the coach window, and seeing  the Cat who had so often brought him game, he commanded his guards to  run immediately to the assistance of his Lordship the Marquis of  Carabas.    While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came  up to the coach and told the King that, while his master was bathing,  there came by some rogues, who ran off with his clothes, though he had  cried out, \"Thieves! thieves!\" several times, as loud as he could. The  cunning Cat had hidden the clothes under a great stone. The King  immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one  of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.    [Illustration: \"THE MARQUIS OF CARABAS IS DROWNING!\" p. 48.]    The King was extremely polite to him, and as the fine clothes he had  given him set off his good looks (for he was well made and handsome),  the King's daughter found him very much to her liking, and the Marquis  of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat  tender glances than she fell in love with him to distraction. The King  would have him come into the coach and take part in the airing.

Quarrels  have usually been settled by contests of strength, called wars.  Believers in the idea of the community of nations argue that wars would  cease or at least become much less frequent if this idea of a community  of nations were generally accepted.    The body of rules which nations recognize in their dealings with each  other is usually spoken of as _international law_. As to certain rules  of international conduct the civilized nations of the world have been in  general agreement for many centuries. Among such rules are those for the  carrying out of treaty obligations, the punishment of piracy, the  protection of each other's ambassadors, the rights of citizens of one  country to the protection of the laws of the country they are visiting,  the protection of women and children in time of war.    As in community law so also in international law rules have frequently  grown up as matters of custom. In the second place agreements have  sometimes been reached through negotiation and written out in the form  of treaties between the two nations concerned. In the latter half of the  nineteenth century several attempts were made to strengthen  international law by means of general conferences of the nations. One of  the most famous of these was the Conference of Geneva in 1864, which  reached a number of valuable agreements on the care of wounded soldiers  and gave official international recognition to the Red Cross. At the  very end of the century occurred the first of the two famous  international conferences at The Hague.    Toward this growing movement in the direction of the setting up of a  community of nations in which each has equal rights and equally  recognizes the force of international law, the German Empire has taken  an attitude of opposition. She has steadily refused to accept her place  as a member of a family of nations. Her leaders have taken the ground,  as explained in Chapter II, that strong nations should control weaker  nations whenever it is to their own interest. As a principle this is  just as barbarous as if in a community the man with the strongest  muscles or the biggest club should be permitted to control the actions  of his neighbors who happened to be weaker or less effectively armed.  Just as the strong brutal man must be taught that laws apply to him as  well as to the weaker members of the community, so must Germany learn to  respect the laws of nations and the rights of weaker peoples.    THE CALL FOR A WORLD PEACE CONFERENCE.--In spite of the rapid growth  of armaments in Europe after 1870 there was growing up among many of the  leading thinkers of the nations a movement looking toward permanent  peace in the world. The movement soon gained great strength among all  classes. Peace societies were formed, meetings were held, and pamphlets  were prepared and distributed. Toward the close of the century public  opinion in most countries was leaning more and more toward the idea of  universal peace. Governments, however, were slower to take up the  problem. Strangely enough the first government to take action in the  matter was that of Russia, at the time the most autocratic of all the  nations of Europe.    Two years before the close of the century Czar Nicholas II sent out an  official invitation calling upon the nations to send representatives to  an international conference to discuss the problem of the prevention of  wars. The Czar pointed out the dangers which must surely result if the  military rivalry of the nations were not checked. He referred to the  fact that European militarism was using up the strength and the wealth  of the nations and was bringing about a condition of military  preparedness which must inevitably lead in the end to a war more  disastrous and terrible than any war in the history of mankind. The Czar  did not go so far as to suggest complete and immediate disarmament.  Every one knew that Europe was not ready to consider so violent a change  of policy. The Russian invitation merely proposed that the conference  should try to agree upon some means for putting a limit upon the  increase of armaments. It suggested that the nations should agree not to  increase their military or naval forces for a certain limited period,  not to add to their annual expenditure of money for military purposes,  and to consider means by which later on there might be an actual  reduction of armaments. It was necessary to avoid the jealousies which  might arise among the great powers if the capital of one of them were  selected for the conference, so the Czar suggested that the meeting take  place at The Hague, the capital of small, peace-loving Holland.    THE FIRST HAGUE CONFERENCE.--The conference called by the Czar met on  May 18, 1899. All the great nations of the world sent delegates, as did  many of the smaller nations. In all, twenty-six governments were  represented, twenty of which were European. The United States and Mexico  were the only countries of the New World which sent representatives. The  queen of Holland showed her appreciation of the honor conferred upon her  country by placing at the disposal of the conference, as its meeting  place, the former summer residence of the royal family, the \"House in  the Woods,\" situated about a mile from the city in the midst of a  beautiful park.    DISARMAMENT.--Although the menace of the tremendous armaments of  Europe had been the chief reason for the conference, absolutely nothing  was accomplished toward solving that problem. This failure was largely  due to the opposition of Germany, which, as the strongest military power  in Europe, would listen to no suggestion looking toward the limitation  of military force. At one of the early meetings of the conference a  German delegate brought out clearly and unmistakably his government's  opposition to any consideration of the subject. In a sarcastic and  arrogant speech he defended the German system of compulsory military  service and her expenditures for military purposes. While it is  extremely doubtful, in view of the difficulties in the way of any  general policy of disarmament, that much could have been accomplished by  the conference even under the most favorable circumstances, this stand  on the part of the German government meant the immediate and absolute  defeat of the suggestion. The other nations of Europe had established  their large military systems as a measure of defense against Germany, so  that in the face of that government's refusal to agree to the policy of  limiting armaments, no neighboring country on the European continent  could adopt it. In the conference, the matter was dismissed after the  adoption of a very general resolution expressing the opinion \"that the  restriction of military charges ... is extremely desirable for the  increase of the material and moral welfare of mankind.\"    ARBITRATION.--The conference met with a somewhat larger measure of  success when it came to discuss the question of the peaceful settlement  of international disputes, though here also the attitude of the German  government stood in the way of complete success. The United States from  the days of John Jay had taken the lead among the nations of the world  in the policy of settling international disputes by peaceful means.  Quite different has been the traditional policy of Prussia, which  throughout its history has relied upon force to accomplish its purposes.  All the German wars of the nineteenth century could easily have been  averted if the Prussian government had honestly desired to settle its  quarrels by peaceful methods. She has taken the ground, however, that  arbitration can only work to her injury, since she is better prepared  for war than any other nation and can mobilize her army more rapidly  than any of her neighbors. \"Arbitration,\" said one of her delegates at  The Hague, \"would simply give rival powers time to put themselves in  readiness, and would therefore be a great disadvantage to Germany.\" This  point of view shows clearly how the German leaders place the growth of  German power far above such considerations as right and justice.    THE HAGUE PEACE TRIBUNAL.--The struggle in the conference over the  question of arbitration centered about the establishment of a permanent  tribunal or international court of arbitration to which nations might  bring their disagreements for settlement. The United States delegation  favored making a definite list of the kinds of disputes which nations  would be compelled to bring to the tribunal for settlement. On the other  hand, the Kaiser himself sent a dispatch from Berlin in which he spoke  strongly against anything in the nature of an arbitration tribunal.  Largely through the efforts of Mr. Andrew D. White, head of the American  delegation, the German government was brought to modify its stand.  Germany finally agreed to the creation of the tribunal, but only on  condition that in no case should the submission of a dispute to it be  compulsory. The tribunal was to be established, but it would have the  right to render a decision only in those cases which the disagreeing  nations might decide to submit to it.    The Hague Tribunal is not made up of permanent judges like an ordinary  court. It consists of persons (not more than four from each country)  selected by the various nations from among their citizens of high  standing and broad knowledge of international affairs. From this long  list any powers between whom there is a disagreement may choose the  persons to form a court or tribunal for their special case.    THE SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE.--The conference of 1899 had proved an  absolute failure so far as disarmament and compulsory arbitration were  concerned. In fact the years immediately following were marked by two  destructive wars: that between Great Britain and the Boers of South  Africa, and the war between Russia and Japan. These wars made it clear  that with the applications of "]]]
