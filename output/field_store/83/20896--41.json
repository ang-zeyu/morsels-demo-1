But Surja Mukhi hearing of this, forbade her to accept the invitation,  and she did not go. Later, Debendra again going to Tara Charan's  house, had an interview with Kunda. Surja Mukhi hearing of this  through others, gave to Tara Charan such a scolding, that from that  time Debendra's visits were stopped.    In this manner three years passed after the marriage; then Kunda  Nandini became a widow. Tara Charan died of fever. Surja Mukhi took  Kunda to live with her, and selling the house she had given to Tara  Charan, gave the proceeds in Government paper to Kunda.    The reader is no doubt much displeased, but in fact the tale is only  begun. Of the poison tree the seed only has thus far been sown.          CHAPTER VII.    HARIDASI BOISNAVI.      The widow Kunda Nandini passed some time in Nagendra's house. One  afternoon the whole household of ladies were sitting together in the  other division of the house, all occupied according to their tastes in  the simple employment of village women. All ages were there, from the  youngest girl to the grey-haired woman. One was binding another's hair,  the other suffering it to be bound; one submitting to have her white  hairs extracted, another extracting them by the aid of a grain of rice;  one beauty sewing together shreds of cloth into a quilt for her boy,  another suckling her child; one lovely being dressing the plaits of her  hair; another beating her child, who now cried aloud, now quietly  sobbed, by turns. Here one is sewing carpet-work, another leaning over  it in admiring examination. There one of artistic taste, thinking of  some one's marriage, is drawing a design on the wooden seats to be used  by the bridal pair. One learned lady is reading Dasu Rai's poetry. An  old woman is delighting the ears of her neighbours with complaints of  her son; a humorous young one, in a voice half bursting with laughter,  relates in the ears of her companions whose husbands are absent some  jocose story of her husband's, to beguile the pain of separation. Some  are reproaching the _Grihini_ (house-mistress), some the _Korta_  (master), some the neighbours; some reciting their own praises. She who  may have received a gentle scolding in the morning from Surja Mukhi on  account of her stupidity, is bringing forward many examples of her  remarkable acuteness of understanding. She in whose cooking the flavours  can never be depended upon, is dilating at great length upon her  proficiency in the art. She whose husband is proverbial in the village  for his ignorance, is astounding her companions by her praises of his  superhuman learning. She whose children are dark and repulsive-looking,  is pluming herself on having given birth to jewels of beauty. Surja  Mukhi was not of the company. She was a little proud, and did not sit  much with these people; if she came amongst them her presence was a  restraint upon the enjoyment of the rest. All feared her somewhat, and  were reserved towards her. Kunda Nandini associated with them; she was  amongst them now, teaching a little boy his letters at his mother's  request. During the lesson the pupil's eyes were fixed upon the  sweetmeat in another child's hand, consequently his progress was not  great. At this moment there appeared amongst them a _Boisnavi_ (female  mendicant), exclaiming, \"_Jai Radhika!_\"[4] (Victory to Radhika).    [Footnote 4: Wife of Krishna.]    A constant stream of guests was served in Nagendra's _Thakur bari_,  and every Sunday quantities of rice were distributed in the same  place, but neither _Boisnavis_ nor others were allowed to come to the  women's apartments to beg; accordingly, on hearing the cry \"_Jai  Radha!_\" in these forbidden precincts, one of the inmates exclaimed:  \"What, woman! do you venture to intrude here? go to the _Thakur  bari_.\" But even as she spoke, turning to look at the _Boisnavi_, she  could not finish her speech, but said instead: \"Oh, ma, what  _Boisnavi_ are you?\"    Looking up, all saw with astonishment that the _Boisnavi_ was young  and of exceeding beauty; in that group of beautiful women there was  none, excepting Kunda Nandini, so beautiful as she. Her trembling  lips, well-formed nose, large lotus-eyes, pencilled brows, smooth,  well-shaped forehead, arms like the lotus-stalk, and complexion like  the _champak_ flower, were rare among women. But had there been  present any critic of loveliness, he would have said there was a want  of sweetness in her beauty, while in her walk and in her movements  there was a masculine character.    The _sandal_ mark[5] on the _Boisnavi's_ nose was long and fine, her  hair was braided, she wore a _sari_ with a coloured border, and  carried a small tambourine in her hand. She wore brass bracelets, and  over them others made of black glass.    [Footnote 5: The caste mark, made with sandal-wood powder.]    One of the elder women addressed her saying, \"Who are you?\"    The _Boisnavi_ replied, \"My name is Haridasi. Will the ladies like a  song?\"    The cry, \"Yes, yes! sing!\" sounded on all sides from old and young.  Raising her tambourine, the _Boisnavi_ seated herself near the ladies,  where Kunda was teaching the little boy. Kunda was very fond of music;  on hearing that the _Boisnavi_ would sing she came nearer. Her pupil  seized the opportunity to snatch the sweetmeat from the other child's  hand, and eat it himself.    The _Boisnavi_ asking what she should sing, the listeners gave a  number of different orders. One called for the strains of _Govinda  Adhikari_, another _Gopale Ure_. She who was reading Dasu Rai's poem  desired to have it sung. Two or three asked for the old stories about  Krishna; they were divided as to whether they would hear about the  companions or about the separation. Some wanted to hear of his herding  the cows in his youth. One shameless girl called out, \"If you do not  sing such and such a passage I will not listen.\" One mere child, by  way of teaching the _Boisnavi_, sang some nonsensical syllables. The  _Boisnavi_, listening to the different demands, gave a momentary  glance at Kunda, saying: \"Have you no commands to give?\"    Kunda, ashamed, bent her head smiling, but did not speak aloud; she  whispered in the ear of a companion, \"Mention some hymn.\"    The companion said, \"Kunda desires that you will sing a hymn.\" The  _Boisnavi_ then began a hymn. Kunda, seeing that the _Boisnavi_ had  neglected all other commands to obey hers, was much abashed. Haridasi,  striking gently on her tambourine as if in sport, recited in a gentle  voice some few notes like the murmuring of a bee in early spring, or a  bashful bride's first loving speech to her husband. Then suddenly she  produced from that insignificant tambourine, as though with the  fingers of a powerful musician, sounds like the crashing of the clouds  in thunder, making the frames of her hearers shrink within them as she  sang in tones more melodious than those of the _Apsharas_ (celestial  singing women).    The ladies, astonished and enchanted, heard the _Boisnavi's_  unequalled voice filling the court with sound that ascended to the  skies. What could secluded women understand of the method of that  singing? An intelligent person would have comprehended that this  perfect singing was not due to natural gifts alone. The _Boisnavi_,  whoever she might be, had received a thorough scientific training in  music, and, though young, she was very proficient.    The _Boisnavi_, having finished her song, was urged by the ladies to  sing again. Haridasi, looking with thirsty eyes at Kunda, sang the  following song from Krishna's address to Radhika:    THE BOISNAVI'S SONG.        \"To see thy beauteous lily face      I come expectant to this place;      Let me, oh Rai! thy feet embrace.      To deprecate thy sullen ire,      Therefore I come in strange attire;      Revive me, Radha, kindness speak,      Clasping thy feet my home I'd seek.      Of thy fair form to catch a ray      From door to door with flute I stray;      When thy soft name it murmurs low      Mine eyes with sudden tears o'erflow.      If thou wilt not my pardon speak      The banks of Jumna's stream I'll seek,      Will break my flute and yield my life;      Oh! cease thy wrath, and end the strife.      The joys of Braj I've cast aside      A slave before thy feet t' abide;      Thine anklets round my neck I'll bind,      In Jumna's stream I'll refuge find.\"    The song over, the _Boisnavi_, looking at Kunda, said, \"Singing has  made me thirsty; give me some water.\"    Kunda brought water in a vessel; but the _Boisnavi_ said, \"I will not  touch your vessel; come near and pour some water into my hands. I was  not born a _Boisnavi_.\" By this she gave it to be understood that she  was formerly of some unholy caste, and had since become a _Boisnavi_.    In reply to her words, Kunda went behind her so as to pour the water  into her hands. They were at such a distance from the rest that words  spoken gently could not be heard by any of them. Kunda poured the  water, and the _Boisnavi_ washed her hands and face.    While thus engaged the latter murmured, \"Are you not Kunda?\"    In astonishment Kunda replied, \"Why do you ask?\"    \"Have you ever seen your mother-in-law?\"    \"No.\"    Kunda had heard that her mother-in-law, having lost her good name, had  left the place.    Then said the _Boisnavi_: \"Your mother-in-law is here now. She is in  my house, and is crying bitterly to be allowed to see you for once.  She dare not show her face to the mistress of this house. Why should  you not go with me to see her? Notwithstanding her fault, she is still  your mother-in-law.\"    Although Kunda was simple, she understood quite well that she should  not acknowledge any connection with such a relation. Therefore she  merely shook her head at the _Boisnavi_'s words and refused her  assent. But the _Boisnavi_ would not take a refusal;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17456"],[0,"The Romance of a Christmas Card (#6)"],[1,"sure,       and I should want them to be, if you use it!                                             Sincerely yours,                                              REBA LARRABEE.             Now here's a Christmas greeting             To the \"folks back home.\"           It comes to you across the space,             Dear folks back home!           I've searched the wide world over,             But no matter where I roam,           No friends are like the old friends,             No folks like those back home!         DEAR MRS. LARRABEE:--         I gave you five dollars for the first picture and verses,       which you, as a writer, regard more highly than I, who am       merely a manufacturer. Please accept twenty dollars for \"The       Folks Back Home,\" on which I hope to make up my loss on the       first card! I insist on signing the despised verse with your       initials. In case R. L. should later come to mean       something, you will be glad that a few thousand people have       seen it.                                             Sincerely,                                              REUBEN SMALL.    The Hessian soldier andirons, the portrait over the Boynton mantel,  and even Letty Boynton's cape were identified on the first card,  sooner or later, but it was obvious that Mrs. Larrabee had to have a  picture for her verses and couldn't be supposed to make one up \"out of  her head\"; though Osh Popham declared it had been done again and again  in other parts of the world. Also it was agreed that, as Letty's face  was not distinguishable, nobody outside of Beulah could recognize her  by her cape; and that anyhow it couldn't make much difference, for if  anybody wanted to spend fifteen cents on a card he would certainly buy  the one about \"the folks back home.\" The popularity of this was  established by the fact that it was selling, not only in Beulah and  Greentown, but in Boston, and in Racine, Wisconsin, and, it was  rumored, even in Chicago. The village milliner in Beulah had disposed  of twenty-seven copies in thirteen days and the minister's wife was  universally conceded to be the most celebrated person in the State of  New Hampshire.    Letty Boynton had an uncomfortable moment when she saw the first card,  but common sense assured her that outside of a handful of neighbors no  one would identify her home surroundings; meantime she was proud of  Reba's financial and artistic triumph in \"The Folks Back Home\" and  generously glad that she had no share in it.    Twice during the autumn David had broken his silence, but only to  send her a postal from some Western town, telling her that he should  have no regular address for a time; that he was traveling for a  publishing firm and felt ill-adapted to the business. He hoped that  she and the children were well, for he himself was not; etc., etc.    The twins had been photographed by Osh Popham, who was Jack of all  trades and master of many, and a sight of their dimpled charms, curly  heads, and straight little bodies would have gladdened any father's  heart, Letty thought. However, she scorned to win David back by any  such specious means. If he didn't care to know whether his children  were hump-backed, bow-legged, cross-eyed, club-footed, or  feeble-minded, why should she enlighten him? This was her usual frame  of mind, but in these last days of the year how she longed to pop the  bewitching photographs and Reba's Christmas cards into an envelope and  send them to David.    But where? No word at all for weeks and weeks, and then only a postal  from St. Joseph, saying that he had given up his position on account  of poor health. Nothing in all this to keep Christmas on, thought  Letty, and she knitted and crocheted and sewed with extra ardor that  the twins' stockings might be filled with bright things of her own  making.          [Illustration]    VI      On the afternoon before Christmas of that year, the North Station in  Boston was filled with hurrying throngs on the way home for the  holidays. Everybody looked tired and excited, but most of them had  happy faces, and men and women alike had as many bundles as they could  carry; bundles and boxes quite unlike the brown paper ones with which  commuters are laden on ordinary days. These were white packages,  beribboned and beflowered and behollied and bemistletoed, to be gently  carried and protected from crushing.    The train was filled to overflowing and many stood in the aisles until  Latham Junction was reached and the overflow alighted to change cars  for Greentown and way stations.    Among the crowd were two men with suit-cases who hurried into the way  train and, entering the smoking car from opposite ends, met in the  middle of the aisle, dropped their encumbrances, stretched out a hand  and ejaculated in the same breath:    \"Dick Larrabee, upon my word!\"    \"Dave Gilman, by all that's great!--Here, let's turn over a seat for  our baggage and sit together. Going home, I s'pose?\"    The men had not met for some years, but each knew something of the  other's circumstances and hoped that the other didn't know too much.  They scanned each other's faces, Dick thinking that David looked  pinched and pale, David half-heartedly registering the quick  impression that Dick was prosperous.    \"Yes,\" David answered; \"I'm going home for a couple of days. It's such  a confounded journey to that one-horse village that a business man  can't get there but once in a generation!\"    \"Awful hole!\" confirmed Dick. \"Simply awful hole! I didn't get it out  of my system for years.\"    \"Married?\" asked David.    \"No; rather think I'm not the marrying kind, though the fact is I've  had no time for love affairs--too busy. Let's see, you have a child,  haven't you?\"    \"Yes; Letty has seen to all that business for me since my wife died.\"  (Wild horses couldn't have dragged the information from him that the  \"child\" was \"twins,\" and Dick didn't need it anyway, for he had heard  the news the morning he left Beulah.) \"Wonder if there have been many  changes in the village?\"    \"Don't know; there never used to be! Mrs. Popham has been ailing for  years,--she couldn't die; and Deacon Todd wouldn't!\" Dick's old  animosities still lingered faintly in his memory, though his laughing  voice and the twinkle in his eyes showed plainly that no bitterness  was left. \"How's business with you, David?\"    \"Only so-so. I've had the devil's own luck lately. Can't get anything  that suits me or that pays a decent income. I formed a new connection  the other day, but I can't say yet what there is in it. I'm just out  of hospital; operation; they cut out the wrong thing first, I believe,  sewed me up absent-mindedly, then remembered it was the other thing,  and did it over again. At any rate, that's the only way I can account  for their mewing me up there for two months.\"    \"Well, well, that is hard luck! I'm sorry, old boy! Things didn't  begin to go my way either till within the last few months. I've always  made a fair living and saved a little money, but never gained any real  headway. Now I've got a first-rate start and the future looks pretty  favorable, and best of all, pretty safe.--No trouble at home calls you  back to Beulah? I hope Letty is all right?\" Dick cast an anxious side  glance at David, though he spoke carelessly.    \"Oh, no! Everything's serene, so far as I know. I'm a poor  correspondent, especially when I've no good news to tell; and anyway,  the mere sight of a pen ties my tongue. I'm just running down to  surprise Letty.\"    Dick looked at David again. He began to think he didn't like him. He  used to, when they were boys, but when he brought that unaccountable  wife home and foisted her and her babies on Letty, he rather turned  against him. David was younger than himself, four or five years  younger, but he looked as if he hadn't grown up. Surely his boyhood  chum hadn't used to be so pale and thin-chested or his mouth so  ladylike and pretty. A good face, though; straight and clean, with  honest eyes and a likable smile. Lack of will, perhaps, or a  persistent run of ill luck. Letty had always kept him stiffened up in  the old days. Dick recalled one of his father's phrases to the effect  that Dave Gilman would spin on a very small biscuit, and wondered if  it were still true.    \"And you, Dick? Your father's still living? You see I haven't kept up  with Beulah lately.\"    \"Keeping up with Beulah! It sounds like the title of a novel, but the  hero would have to be a snail or he'd pass Beulah in the first  chapter!--Yes, father's hale and hearty, I believe.\"    \"You come home every Christmas, I s'pose?\" inquired David.    \"No; as a matter of fact this is my first visit since I left for  good.\"    \"That's about my case.\" And David, hung his head a little,  unconsciously.    \"That so? Well, I was a hot-headed fool when I said good-bye to  Beulah, and it's taken me all this time to cool off and make up my  mind to apologize to the dad. There's--there's rather a queer  coincidence about my visit just at this time.\"    \"Speaking of coincidences,\" said David, \"I can beat yours, whatever it  is. If the thought of your father brought you back, my mother drew  me--this way!\" And he took something from his inside coat pocket.--\"Do  you see that?\"    Dick regarded the object blankly, then with a quick gesture dived into  his pocket and brought forth another of the same general character.  \"How about this?\" he asked.    Each had one of Reba Larrabee's Christmas cards but David had the  first unsuccessful one and Dick the popular one with the lonely  little gray house and the verse about the folks back home.    The men looked at each other in astonishment and Dick gave a low  whistle. Then they bent over the cards together.    \"It was mother's picture that pulled me back to Beulah, I don't mind  telling you,\" said David, his mouth twitching. \"Don't you see it?\"    \"Oh! Is that your mother?\" And Dick scanned the card "]]]
