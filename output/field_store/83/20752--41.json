His vague suspicion  was strengthened by something that happened to him.  He went up into the mountains, hewed twelve stones out of  the quarry, and wrote the names of his sons thereon, their  constellations, and the months corresponding to the  constellations,  a stone for a son, thus, \"Reuben, Ram, Nisan,\" and  so for each of his twelve sons. Then he addressed the  stones and bade them bow down before the one marked with  Reuben's name, constellation, and month, and they did not  move. He gave the same order regarding the stone marked  for Simon, and again the stones stood still. And so he did  respecting all his sons, until he reached the stone for Joseph.  When he spoke concerning this one, \"I command you to fall  down before Joseph,\" they all prostrated themselves. He  tried the same test with other things, with trees and sheaves,  and always the result was the same, and Jacob could not but  feel that his suspicion was true, Joseph was alive.[67]    There was a reason why God did not reveal the real fate  of Joseph to Jacob. When his brethren sold Joseph, their  fear that the report of their iniquity might reach the ears of  Jacob led them to pronounce the ban upon any that should  betray the truth without the consent of all the others. Judah  advanced the objection that a ban is invalid unless it is decreed  in the presence of ten persons, and there were but nine  of them, for Reuben and Benjamin were not there when the  sale of Joseph was concluded. To evade the difficulty, the  brothers counted God as the tenth person, and therefore God  felt bound to refrain from revealing the true state of things  to Jacob. He had regard, as it were, for the ban pronounced  by the brethren of Joseph.[68] And as God kept the truth a  secret from Jacob, Isaac did not feel justified in acquainting  him with his grandson's fate, which was well known to him,  for he was a prophet. Whenever he was in the company of  Jacob, he mourned with him, but as soon as he quitted him,  he left off from manifesting grief, because he knew that  Joseph lived.[69]    Jacob was thus the only one among Joseph's closest kinsmen  that remained in ignorance of his son's real fortunes,  and he was the one of them all that had the greatest reason  for regretting his death. He spoke: \"The covenant that  God made with me regarding the twelve tribes is null and  void now. I did strive in vain to establish the twelve tribes,  seeing that now the death of Joseph hath destroyed the covenant.  All the works of God were made to correspond to the  number of the tribes--twelve are the signs of the zodiac,  twelve the months, twelve hours hath the day, twelve the  night, and twelve stones are set in Aaron's breastplate--and now  that Joseph hath departed, the covenant of the  tribes is set at naught.\"    He could not replace the lost son by entering into a new  marriage, for he had made the promise to his father-in-law  to take none beside his daughters to wife, and this promise,  as he interpreted it, held good after the death of Laban's  daughters as well as while they were alive.[70]    Beside grief over his loss and regret at the breaking of  the covenant of the tribes, Jacob had still another reason for  mourning the death of Joseph. God had said to Jacob, \"If  none of thy sons dies during thy lifetime, thou mayest look  upon it as a token that thou wilt not be put in Gehenna after  thy death.\" Thinking Joseph to be dead, Jacob had his own  fate to bewail, too, for he now believed that he was doomed  to Gehenna.[71] His mourning lasted all of twenty-two years,  corresponding to the number of the years he had dwelt  apart from his parents, and had not fulfilled the duty of a  son toward them.[72]    In his mourning Jacob put sackcloth upon his loins, and  therein be became a model for the kings and princes in  Israel, for David, Ahab, Joram, and Mordecai did likewise  when a great misfortune befell the nation.[73]      JUDAH AND HIS SONS    When the sons of Jacob saw how inconsolable their father  was, they went to Judah, and said to him, \"This great misfortune  is thy fault.\" Judah replied: \"It was I that asked  you, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his  blood? and now you say the sin lies at my door.\" The  brethren continued to argue: \"But it was thou that didst  say, Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and we followed  thy advice. Hadst thou said, Let us restore him to  his father, we had heeded these words of thine as well.\"    The brethren hereupon deprived Judah of his dignity, for  hitherto he had been their king, and they also excluded him  from their fellowship, and he had to seek his fortune alone.[74]  Through the mediation of his chief shepherd Hirah, he became  acquainted with the Canaanitish king of Adullam,  Barsan by name. Though he was well aware of the corruption  of the generations of Canaan, he permitted passion to  get the better of him, and took a Canaanite to wife. The  Adullamite king gave a banquet in his honor, at which his  daughter Bath-shua poured the wine, and intoxicated by  wine and passion Judah took her and married her.[75] Judah's  action may be compared to that of the lion who passes a carrion  and eats of it, though a cur preceding him on the way  had refused to touch it. Even Esau came in time to acknowledge  that the daughters of Canaan were wicked, and  the lion Judah must needs take one of them to wife.[76] The  holy spirit cried out against Judah when he married the  Canaanite woman of Adullam, saying, \"The glory of Israel  went down in Adullam.\"[77]    The first-born son of Judah from this marriage was  named Er, \"the childless,\" a suitable name for him that  died without begetting any issue.[78] At Judah's desire, Er  married Tamar, a daughter of Aram, the son of Shem, but  because she was not a Canaanitish woman, his mother used  artifices against her, and he did not know her, and an angel  of the Lord killed him on the third day after his wedding.  Then Judah gave Tamar to his second son Onan, the marriage  taking place before the week of the wedding festivities  for Er had elapsed. A whole year Onan lived with Tamar  without knowing her, and when, finally, Judah uttered  threats against him on that account, he did, indeed, have  intercourse with her, but, giving heed to the injunctions of  his mother, he took care not to beget any children with her.[79]  He, too, died on account of his iniquity, and his name Onan  \"mourning,\" was well chosen, for very soon was his father  called upon to mourn for him.[80] Now Judah conceived the  plan of marrying Tamar to his youngest son Shelah, but his  wife would not permit it. She hated Tamar because she  was not of the daughters of Canaan like herself, and while  Judah was away from home, Bath-shua chose a wife for her  son Shelah from the daughters of Canaan. Judah was very  angry at Bath-shua for what she had done, and also God  poured out His wrath upon her, for on account of her wickedness  she had to die,[81] and her death happened a year after  that of her two sons.    Now that Bath-shua was dead, Judah might have carried  out his wish and married Tamar to his youngest son. But  he waited for Shelah to grow up, because he feared for his  life, seeing that Tamar had brought death to two husbands  before him. So she remained a widow in her father's house  for two years. Endowed with the gift of prophecy, Tamar  knew that she was appointed to be the ancestress of David  and of the Messiah, and she determined to venture upon an  extreme measure in order to make sure of fulfilling her  destiny.[82] Accordingly, when the holy spirit revealed to her  that Judah was going up to Timnah,[83] she put off from her  the garments of her widowhood, and sat in the gate of Abraham's  tent, and there she encountered Judah.[84] All the time  she lived in the house of her father-in-law, he had never  seen her face, for in her virtue and chastity she had always  kept it covered, and now when Judah met her, he did not  recognize her. It was as a reward for her modesty that God  made her to become the mother of the royal line of David,  and the ancestress of Isaiah, and his father Amoz as well,  both of whom were prophets and of royal blood.[85]    Judah passed Tamar by without paying any attention to  her, and she raised her eyes heavenward, and said, \"O Lord  of the world, shall I go forth empty from the house of this  pious man?\" Then God sent the angel that is appointed  over the passion of love, and he compelled Judah to turn  back.[86] With prophetic caution, Tamar demanded that, as a  pledge for the reward he promised her, he leave with her  his signet, his mantle, and his staff, the symbols of royalty,  judgeship, and Messiahship, the three distinctions of the  descendants of Tamar from her union with Judah. When  Judah sent her the promised reward, a kid of the goats, by  the hand of his friend, in order to receive the pledges from  her hand, Tamar could not be found, and he feared to make  further search for her, lest he be put to shame. But Tamar,  who soon discerned that she was with child, felt very happy  and proud, for she knew that she would be the mother of  kings and redeemers.[87]    When her state became known, she was forcibly dragged  before the court, in which Isaac, Jacob, and Judah sat as  judges. Judah, being the youngest of the judges and the  least considerable in dignity, was the first to give a decision,  for thus it is prescribed in criminal cases, that the prominent  judges overawe not the lesser and influence their decisions  unduly. It was the opinion of Judah that the woman was  liable to the penalty of death by burning, for she was the  daughter of the high priest Shem, and death by fire is the  punishment ordained by the law for a high priest's daughter  that leads an unchaste life.[88]    The preparations for her execution were begun.

Grandfather Frog settled himself comfortably on his big green lily-pad  and looked very hard at Peter.    \"I'm going to tell you a story, Peter Rabbit,\" said he, \"so that never  again will you be led to doubt that Old Mother Nature knows exactly  what she is about. In the first place, Sammy Jay is not wholly to  blame for all his bad habits. Some of them were handed down to him  with his fine coat, just the same as your troublesome curiosity was  handed down to you with the white patch on the seat of your trousers.\"    Peter nodded. He had felt a great many times that he just couldn't  help this habit of poking that wobbly little nose of his in where it  had no business to be, any more than he could change that funny little  bunch of white cotton, which he called a tail, for a really, truly  tail.    \"Of course, you have heard all about what a very fine gentleman Sammy  Jay's great-great-ever-so-great grandfather was thought to be until it  was discovered that he was all the time stealing from his neighbors  and putting the blame on others, and how Old Mother Nature punished  him by taking away the beautiful voice of which he was so proud, and  giving him instead the harsh voice which Sammy has now, and making him  tell just what he is by screaming 'thief, thief, thief!' every time he  opens his mouth to speak.    \"At first Old Mother Nature had intended to take away the fine coat of  which Mr. Jay was so proud, but when he discovered that he had lost  his fine voice, he was so ashamed that he hurried away to hide himself  from the eyes of his neighbors, so that Old Mother Nature didn't have  time to change his coat just then.    'I'll wait a bit,' said she to herself, 'and see how he behaves.  Perhaps he is truly sorry for what he has done, and I will not have to  punish him more.'    \"But if Mr. Jay was truly sorry, he gave no signs of it. You see, he  had cheated his neighbors, and had stolen from them for so long, that  he found this the easiest way to get a living. His bad habits had  become fixed, as bad habits have a way of doing. Besides, right down  in his heart, he wasn't sorry for what he had done, only angry at  having been found out. Now that he had been found out, of course every  one was on the watch for him, and it wasn't so easy to steal as it had  been before. So now, instead of going about openly, with his head held  high, he grew very crafty, and sneaked quietly about through the Green  Forest, trying to keep out of sight, that he might the easier steal  from his neighbors and make trouble for them.    \"When Old Mother Nature saw this, she changed her mind about taking  away his handsome suit. 'If I do that,' thought she, 'it will make it  all the easier for him to keep out of sight, and all the harder for  his neighbors to know when he is about.'    \"So instead of giving him the plain, homely suit that she had thought  of giving him, she made his coat of blue brighter than before and  trimmed it with the whitest of white trimmings, so that Mr. Jay had  one of the very handsomest coats in all the Green Forest. At first he  was very proud of it, but it wasn't long before he found that it was  very hard work to keep out of sight when he wanted to. That bright  blue coat was forever giving him away when he was out on mischief.  Everybody was all the time on the watch for it, and so where in the  past Mr. Jay had been able, without any trouble, to steal all he  wanted to eat, now he sometimes actually had to work for his food, and  get it honestly or else go hungry.    \"You would suppose that he would have mended him ways, wouldn't you?\"    Peter nodded.    \"But he didn't. He grew more sly and crafty than ever. But in spite of  this, he didn't begin to make as much trouble as before. He couldn't,  you know, because of his bright coat. When Old Mother Nature found  that Mr. Jay had passed along his bad habits to his children, she  passed along his handsome blue coat, too, and so it has been from that  long-ago day right down to this. Sammy Jay's fine coat isn't a reward  for goodness, as is Winsome Bluebird's, but is to help the other  little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows to protect  themselves, and keep track of Sammy when he is sneaking and snooping  around looking for mischief. Now what do you think, Peter Rabbit?\"    Peter scratched one long ear and then the other long ear thoughtfully,  and he looked a wee bit ashamed as he replied: \"I guess Old Mother  Nature makes no mistakes and always knows just what she is doing.\"    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest voice. \"You may be  sure she does. And another thing, Peter Rabbit: Never judge any one by  his clothes. It is a great mistake, a very great mistake. Plain  clothes sometimes cover the kindest hearts, and fine clothes often are  a warning to beware of mischief.\"    \"I--I don't know but you are right,\" admitted Peter.    \"I know I am,\" said Grandfather Frog.          VII    WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER      Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck had gone down to the Smiling Pool for a  call on their old friend, Jerry Muskrat. But Jerry was nowhere to be  seen. They waited and waited, but no Jerry Muskrat.    \"Probably he is taking a nap in that big house of his,\" said Johnny  Chuck, \"and if he is we'll have to sit here until he wakes up, or else  go back home and visit him some other time.\"    \"That's so,\" replied Peter. \"I don't see what he has his house in the  water for, anyway. If he had built it on land, like sensible people,  we might be able to waken him. Funny place to build a house, isn't  it?\"    Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully. \"It does seem a funny  place,\" he admitted. \"It certainly does seem a funny place. But then,  Jerry Muskrat is a funny fellow. You know how much of the time he  stays in the water. That seems funny to me. I suppose there is a  reason for it, and probably there is a reason for building his house  where it is. I've found that there is a reason for most things.  Probably Jerry's great-great-grandfather built his house that way, and  so Jerry does the same thing.\"    Peter Rabbit suddenly brightened up. \"I do believe you are right,  Johnny Chuck, and if you are, there must be a story about it, and if  there is a story, Grandfather Frog will be sure to know it. There he  is, over on his big green lily-pad, and he looks as if he might be  feeling very good-natured this morning. Let's go ask him why Jerry  Muskrat builds his house in the water.\"    Grandfather Frog saw them coming, and he guessed right away that they  were coming for a story. He grinned to himself and pretended to go to  sleep.    \"Good morning, Grandfather Frog,\" said Johnny Chuck. Grandfather Frog  didn't answer. Johnny tried again, and still no reply.    \"He's asleep,\" said Johnny, looking dreadfully disappointed, \"and I  guess we'd better not disturb him, for he might wake up cross, and of  course we wouldn't get a story if he did.\"    Peter looked at Grandfather Frog sharply. He wasn't so sure that that  was a real nap. It seemed to him that there was just the least little  hint of a smile in the corners of Grandfather Frog's big mouth. \"You  sit here a minute,\" he whispered in Johnny Chuck's ear.    So Johnny Chuck sat down where he was, which was right where  Grandfather Frog could see him by lifting one eyelid just the teeniest  bit, and Peter hopped along the bank until he was right behind  Grandfather Frog. Now just at that place on the bank was growing a  toadstool. Peter looked over at Johnny Chuck and winked. Then he  turned around, and with one of his long hind-feet, he kicked the  toadstool with all his might. Now toadstools, as you all know, are not  very well fastened at the roots, and this one was no different from  the rest. When Peter kicked it it flew out into the air and landed  with a great splash in the Smiling Pool, close beside the big green  lily-pad on which Grandfather Frog was sitting. Of course he didn't  see it coming, and of course it gave him a great start.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" exclaimed Grandfather Frog and dived head first into the  water. A minute later Peter's sharp eyes saw him peeping out from  under a lily-pad to see what had frightened him so.    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" shouted Peter, dancing about on the bank. \"Ha, ha, ha!  Grandfather Frog, afraid of a toadstool! Ha, ha, ha!\"    At first Grandfather Frog was angry, very angry indeed. But he is too  old and too wise to lose his temper for long over a joke, especially  when he has been fairly caught trying to play a joke himself. So  presently he climbed back on to his big green lily-pad, blinking his  great, goggly eyes and looking just a wee bit foolish.    \"Chug-a-rum! I might have known that that was some of your work,  Peter Rabbit,\" said he, \"but I thought it surely was a stone thrown  by Farmer Brown's boy. What do you mean by frightening an old fellow  like me this way?\"    \"Just trying to get even with you for trying to fool us into thinking  that you were asleep when you were wide awake,\" replied Peter. \"Oh,  Grandfather Frog, do tell us why it is that Jerry Muskrat builds his  house in the water. Please do!\"    \"I have a mind not to, just to get even with you,\" said Grandfather  Frog, settling himself comfortably, \"but I believe I will, to show you  that there are some folks who can take a joke without losing their  temper.\"    \"Goody!\" cried Peter and Johnny Chuck together, sitting down side by  side on the very edge of the bank.    Grandfather Frog folded his hands across his"]]]
