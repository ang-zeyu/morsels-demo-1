He was worshipped under the symbol of a conical stone, probably an  aerolite, surmounted by a gilded crescent, and the ground-plan of the  town roughly described a crescent-shaped curve in honour of its patron.  His cult, even down to late times, was connected with cruel practices;  generations after the advent to power of the Abbasside caliphs, his  faithful worshippers continued to sacrifice to him human victims, whose  heads, prepared according to the ancient rite, were accustomed to give  oracular responses.* The government of the surrounding country was  in the hands of princes who were merely vicegerents:** Chaldaean  civilization before the beginnings of history had more or less laid hold  of them, and made them willing subjects to the kings of Babylon.***         * Without seeking to specify exactly which were the       doctrines introduced into Harranian religion subsequently to       the Christian era, we may yet affirm that the base of this       system of faith was merely a very distorted form of the       ancient Chaldaean worship practised in the town.         ** Only one vicegerent of Mesopotamia is known at present,       and he belongs to the Assyrian epoch. His seal is preserved       in the British Museum.         *** The importance of Harran in the development of the       history of the first Chaldaean empire was pointed out by       Winckler; but the theory according to which this town was       the capital of the kingdom, called by the Chaldaean and       Assyrian scribes \"the kingdom of the world,\" is justly       combated by Tiele.    These sovereigns were probably at the outset somewhat obscure  personages, without much prestige, being sometimes independent and  sometimes subject to the rulers of neighbouring states, among others to  those of Agade. In later times, when Babylon had attained to universal  power, and it was desired to furnish her kings with a continuous  history, the names of these earlier rulers were sought out, and added  to those of such foreign princes as had from time to time enjoyed the  sovereignty over them--thus forming an interminable list which for  materials and authenticity would well compare with that of the Thinite  Pharaohs. This list has come down to us incomplete, and its remains do  not permit of our determining the exact order of reigns, or the status  of the individuals who composed it. We find in it, in the period  immediately subsequent to the Deluge, mention of mythical heroes,  followed by names which are still semi-legendary, such as Sargon the  Elder; the princes of the series were, however, for the most part  real beings, whose memories had been preserved by tradition, or whose  monuments were still existing in certain localities. Towards the end of  the XXVth century before our era, however, a dynasty rose into power of  which all the members come within the range of history.*         * This dynasty, which is known to us in its entirety by the       two lists of G. Smith and by Pinches, was legitimately       composed of only eleven kings, and was known as the       Babylonian dynasty, although Sayce suspects it to be of       Arabian origin. It is composed as follows:--    [Illustration: 039.jpg TABLE]    The dates of this dynasty are not fixed with entire certainty. The first  of them, Sumuabim, has left us some contracts bearing the dates of one  or other of the fifteen years of his reign, and documents of public or  private interest abound in proportion as we follow down the line of his  successors. Sumulailu, who reigned after him, was only distantly related  to his predecessor; but from Sumulailu to Sam-shusatana the kingly power  was transmitted from father to son without a break for nine generations,  if we may credit the testimony of the official lists.*         * Simulailu, also written Samu-la-ilu, whom Mr. Pinches has       found in a contract tablet associated with Pungunila as       king, was not the son of Sumuabim, since the lists do not       mention him as such; he must, however, have been connected       with some sort of relationship, or by marriage, with his       predecessor, since both are placed in the same dynasty. A       few contracts of Sumulailu are given by Meissner. Samsuiluna       calls him \"my forefather (d-gula-mu), the fifth king before       me.\"         Hommel believes that the order of the dynasties has been       reversed, and that the first upon the lists we possess was       historically the second; he thus places the Babylonian       dynasty between 2035 and 1731 B.C. His opinion has not been       generally adopted, but every Assyriologist dealing with this       period proposes a different date for the reigns in this       dynasty; to take only one characteristic example, Khammurabi       is placed by Oppert in the year 2394-2339, by Delitzsch-       Murdter in 2287-2232, by Winckler in 2264-2210, and by       Peiser in 2139-2084, and by Carl Niebuhr in 2081-2026.      Contemporary records, however, prove that the course of affairs did  not always run so smoothly. They betray the existence of at least  one usurper--Immeru--who, even if he did not assume the royal titles,  enjoyed the supreme power for several years between the reigns of Zabu  and Abilsin. The lives of these rulers closely resembled those of their  contemporaries of Southern Chaldaea. They dredged the ancient canals, or  constructed new ones; they restored the walls of their fortresses, or  built fresh strongholds on the frontier;* they religiously kept the  festivals of the divinities belonging to their terrestrial domain, to  whom they annually rendered solemn homage.         * Sumulailu had built six such large strongholds of brick,       which were repaired by Samsuiluna five generations later. A       contract of Sinmuballit is dated the year in which he built       the great wall of a strong place, the name of which is       unfortunately illegible on the fragment which we possess.    They repaired the temples as a matter of course, and enriched them  according to their means; we even know that Zabu, the third in order  of the line of sovereigns, occupied himself in building the sanctuary  Eulbar of Anunit, in Sippara. There is evidence that they possessed the  small neighbouring kingdoms of Kishu, Sippara, and Kuta, and that they  had consolidated them into a single state, of which Babylon was the  capital. To the south their possessions touched upon those of the kings  of Uru, but the frontier was constantly shifting, so that at one time an  important city such as Nippur belonged to them, while at another it fell  under the dominion of the southern provinces. Perpetual war was waged  in the narrow borderland which separated the two rival states, resulting  apparently in the balance of power being kept tolerably equal between  them under the immediate successors of Sumuabim* --the obscure Sumulailu,  Zabum, the usurper Immeru, Abilsin and Sinmuballit--until the reign of  Khammurabi (the son of Sinmuballit), who finally made it incline to  his side.** The struggle in which he was engaged, and which, after many  vicissitudes, he brought to a successful issue, was the more decisive,  since he had to contend against a skilful and energetic adversary who  had considerable forces at his disposal. Birnsin*** was, in reality, of  Elamite race, and as he held the province of Yamutbal in appanage, he  was enabled to muster, in addition to his Chaldaean battalions, the army  of foreigners who had conquered the maritime regions at the mouth of the  Tigris and the Euphrates.         * None of these facts are as yet historically proved: we       may, however, conjecture with some probability what was the       general state of things, when we remember that the first       kings of Babylon were contemporaries of the last independent       sovereigns of Southern Chaldaea.         ** The name of this prince has been read in several ways--       Hammurabi, Khammurabi, by the earlier Assyriologists,       subsequently Hammuragash, Khammuragash, as being of Elamite       or Cossoan extraction: the reading Khammurabi is at present       the prevailing one. The bilingual list published by Pinches       makes Khammurabi an equivalent of the Semitic names Kimta-       rapashtum. Hence Halevy concluded that Khammurabi was a       series of ideograms, and that Kimtarapashtum was the true       reading of the name; his proposal, partially admitted by       Hommel, furnishes us with a mixed reading of Khammurapaltu,       Amraphel. [Hommel is now convinced of the identity of the       Amraphel of _Gen._ xiv. I with Khammurabi.--Te.] Sayce,       moreover, adopts the reading Khammurabi, and assigns to him       an Arabian origin. The part played by this prince was       pointed out at an early date by Menant. Recent discoveries       have shown the important share which he had in developing       the Chaldaean empire, and have, increased his reputation with       Assyriologists.         *** The name of this king has been the theme of heated       discussions: it was at first pronounced Aradsin, Ardusin, or       Zikarsin; it is now read in several different ways--Rimsin,       or Eriaku, Riaku, Rimagu. Others have made a distinction       between the two forms, and have made out of them the names       of two different kings. They are all variants of the same       name. I have adopted the form Rimsin, which is preferred by       a few Assyriologists. [The tablets recently discovered by       Mr. Pinches, referring to Kudur-lagamar and Tudkhula, which       he has published in a Paper road before the Victoria       Institute, Jan. 20, 1896, have shown that the true reading  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"long to enumerate the various objects of merchandise brought  in almost daily to the marts on the Nile by Phoenician vessels or the  owners of caravans. They comprised slaves destined for the workshop or  the harem,* Hittite bulls and stallions, horses from Singar, oxen from  Alasia, rare and curious animals such as elephants from Nii, and  brown bears from the Lebanon,** smoked and salted fish, live birds of  many-coloured plumage, goldsmiths'work*** and precious stones, of which  lapis-lazuli was the chief.         * Syrian slaves are mentioned along with Ethiopian in the       _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1, and there is mention in the Tel       el-Amarna correspondence of Hittite slaves whom Dushratta of       Mitanni brought to Amenothes III., and of other presents of       the same kind made by the King of Alasia as a testimony of       his grateful homage.         ** The elephant and the bear are represented on the tomb of       liakhmiri among the articles of tribute brought into Egypt.         *** The _Annals of Thutmosis III_. make a record in each       campaign of the importation of gold and silver vases,       objects in lapis-lazuli and crystal, or of blocks of the       same materials; the Theban tombs of this period afford       examples of the vases and blocks brought by the Syrians. The       Tel el-Amarna letters also mention vessels of gold or blocks       of precious stone sent as presents or as objects of exchange       to the Pharaoh by the King of Babylon, by the King of       Mitanni, by the King of the Hittites, and by other princes.       The lapis-lazuli of Babylon, which probably came from       Persia, was that which was most prized by the Egyptians on       account of the golden sparks in it, which enhanced the blue       colour; this is, perhaps, the Uknu of the cuneiform       inscriptions, which has been read for a long time as       \"crystal.\"    [Illustration: 032b.jpg PAINTED TABLETS IN THE HALL OF HARPS]    Wood for building or for ornamental work--pine,cypress, yew, cedar,  and oak,* musical instruments,** helmets, leathern jerkins covered with  metal scales, weapons of bronze and iron,*** chariots,**** dyed and  embroidered stuffs,^ perfumes,^^ dried cakes, oil, wines of Kharu,  liqueurs from Alasia, Khati, Singar, Naharaim, Amurru, and beer from  Qodi.^^^         * Building and ornamental woods are often mentioned in the       inscriptions of Thutmosis III. A scene at Karnak represents       Seti I. causing building-wood to be cut in the region of the       Lebanon. A letter of the King of Alasia speaks of       contributions of wood which several of his subjects had to       make to the King of Egypt.         ** Some stringed instruments of music, and two or three       kinds of flutes and flageolets, are designated in Egyptian       by names borrowed from some Semitic tongue--a fact which       proves that they were imported; the wooden framework of the       harp, decorated with sculptured heads of Astarto, figures       among the objects coming from Syria in the temple of the       Theban Anion.         *** Several names of arms borrowed from some Semitic dialect       have been noticed in the texts of this period. The objects       as well as the words must have been imported into Egypt,       e.g. the quiver, the sword and javelins used by the       charioteers. Cuirasses and leathern jerkins are mentioned in       the inscriptions of Thutmosis III.         **** Chariots plated with gold and silver figure frequently       among the spoils of Thutmosis III.: the Anastasi Papyrus,       No. 1, contains a detailed description of Syrian chariots--       Markabuti--with a reference to the localities whore certain       parts of them were made;--the country of the Amurru, that of       Aupa, the town of Pahira. The Tel el-Amarna correspondence       mentions very frequently chariots sent to the Pharaoh by the       King of Babylon, either as presents or to be sold in Egypt;       others sent by the King of Alasia and by the King of       Mitanni.         ^ Some linen, cotton, or woollen stuffs are mentioned in the       _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 4, and elsewhere as coming from       Syria. The Egyptian love of white linen always prevented       their estimating highly the coloured and brocaded stuffs of       Asia; and one sees nowhere, in the representations, any       examples of stuffs of such origin, except on furniture or in       ships equipped with something of the kind in the form of       sails.         ^^ The perfumed oils of Syria are mentioned in a general way       in the _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1; the King of Alasia speaks       of essences which he is sending to Amenothes III.; the King       of Mitanni refers to bottles of oil which he is forwarding       to Gilukhipa and to Tii.         ^^^ A list of cakes of Syrian origin is found in the       _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1; also a reference to balsamic oils       from Naharaim, and to various oils which had arrived in the       ports of the Delta, to the wines of Syria, to palm wine and       various liqueurs manufactured in Alasia, in Singar, among       the Khati, Amorites, and the people of. Tikhisa; finally, to       the beer of Qodi.    [Illustration: 034.jpg. THE BEAR AND ELEPHANT BROUGHT AS TRIBUTE IN THE  TOMB OF RAKHMIRI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph of Prisse       d'Avennes' sketch.    On arriving at the frontier, whether by sea or by land, the majority of  these objects had to pay the custom dues which were rigorously collected  by the officers of the Pharaoh. This, no doubt, was a reprisal tariff,  since independent sovereigns, such as those of Mitanni, Assyria, and  Babylon, were accustomed to impose a similar duty on all the products  of Egypt. The latter, indeed, supplied more than she received, for many  articles which reached her in their raw condition were, by means of  native industry, worked up and exported as ornaments, vases, and highly  decorated weapons, which, in the course of international traffic, were  dispersed to all four corners of the earth. The merchants of Babylon and  Assyria had little to fear as long as they kept within the domains of  their own sovereign or in those of the Pharaoh; but no sooner did they  venture within the borders of those turbulent states which separated  the two great powers, than they were exposed to dangers at every turn.  Safe-conducts were of little use if they had not taken the additional  precaution of providing a strong escort and carefully guarding their  caravan, for the Shausu concealed in the depths of the Lebanon or the  needy sheikhs of Kharu could never resist the temptation to rob the  passing traveller.*         * The scribe who in the reign of Ramses II. composed the       _Travels of an Egyptian_, speaks in several places of       marauding tribes and robbers, who infested the roads       followed by the hero. The Tel el-Amarna correspondence       contains a letter from the King of Alasia, who exculpates       himself from being implicated in the harsh treatment certain       Egyptians had received in passing through his territory; and       another letter in which the King of Babylon complains that       Chaldoan merchants had been robbed at Khinnatun, in Galilee,       by the Prince of Akku (Acre) and his accomplices: one of       them had his feet cut off, and the other was still a       prisoner in Akku, and Burnaburiash demands from Amenothes       IV. the death of the guilty persons.    The victims complained to their king, who felt no hesitation in passing  on their woes to the sovereign under whose rule the pillagers were  supposed to live. He demanded their punishment, but his request was not  always granted, owing to the difficulties of finding out and seizing the  offenders. An indemnity, however, could be obtained which would nearly  compensate the merchants for the loss sustained. In many cases justice  had but little to do with the negotiations, in which self-interest was  the chief motive; but repeated refusals would have discouraged traders,  and by lessening the facilities of transit, have diminished the revenue  which the state drew from its foreign commerce.    The question became a more delicate one when it concerned the rights of  subjects residing out of their native country. Foreigners, as a rule,  were well received in Egypt; the whole country was open to them;  they could marry, they could acquire houses and lands, they enjoyed  permission to follow their own religion unhindered, they were eligible  for public honours, and more than one of the officers of the crown  whose tombs we see at Thebes were themselves Syrians, or born of Syrian  parents on the banks of the Nile.*         * In a letter from the King of Alasia, there is question of       a merchant who had died in Egypt. Among other monuments       proving the presence of Syrians about the Pharaoh, is the       stele of Ben-Azana, of the town of Zairabizana, surnamed       Ramses-Empiri: he was surrounded with Semites like himself.    Hence, those who settled in Egypt without any intention of returning to  their own country enjoyed all the advantages possessed by the natives,  whereas those who took up a merely temporary abode there were more  limited in their privileges. They were granted the permission to hold  property in the country, and also the right to buy and sell there, but  they were not allowed to transmit their possessions at will, and if by  chance they died on Egyptian soil, their goods lapsed as a forfeit to  the crown. The heirs remaining in the native country of the dead man,  who were ruined by this confiscation, sometimes petitioned the king to  interfere in their favour with a view of obtaining restitution. If the  Pharaoh consented to waive his right of forfeiture, and made over  the confiscated objects or their equivalent to the relatives of the  deceased, it was solely by an act of mercy, and as an example "]]]
