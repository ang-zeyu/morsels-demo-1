One day he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, and  in his wrath he slew the Egyptian on the spot. News of the deed came  to Pharaoh the king, and Moses fled into a place called Midian. Here  for forty years he lived a quiet pastoral life as a shepherd for  Jethro, whose daughter he had married.    Then came the divine call. He was alone with his sheep on the  mountain-side, when he heard a voice saying, \"Come now and I will send  thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children  of Israel out of Egypt,... and I will bring you up out of the  affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites ... unto a land  flowing with milk and honey.\"[10] Thus Moses became the leader of his  people in their exodus, or departure from Egypt.    [Footnote 10: Exodus, chapter iii verses 10 and 17.]    [Illustration: MOSES. _Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, Rome._]    After many strange experiences, the great company of emigrants made  the passage of the Red Sea in safety, and Moses showed his poetic  gifts in a song of triumph. Many years of slavery had taken the spirit  out of the Hebrews, and they needed a wise head and a firm hand to  govern them. Moses had both, and he was, besides, a man of God.  Going apart from them for a season of divine communion on the  mountain, he spent forty days in preparation for a system of  government. On his return he brought with him two tables of stone,  inscribed with the ten great commandments, which are at the foundation  of right character. He had also detailed directions for their daily  conduct, and for their religious ceremonial.    The people for whose good all these plans were made were in the mean  time discouraged by the long absence of their leader. They had no idea  how much he was doing for them, and in their folly they forgot his  teachings, and began to practise the idolatrous customs they had seen  in Egypt. On descending the mountain, Moses found them worshipping the  golden image of a calf. It is not to be wondered at that, as the  historian says,[11] \"Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out  of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.\"    [Footnote 11: Exodus, chapter xxxii. verse 19.]    Again Moses went up into the mount for communion with God, and again  two tables of stone were inscribed with the ten commandments, to  replace those which had been destroyed. Again, also, he was gone forty  days, and this time he was given a mysterious revelation of the  goodness of God.    Thus it was that when he came down the people were afraid to come  near, for[12] \"the skin of his face shone,\" or \"put forth beams,\" as  the expression reads in some Bible translations. In the old Latin  version made by Jerome in the fifth century, and known as the Vulgate,  translated into what is now called the Douay Bible, we read that  \"Moses' face was horned.\" This is why all the old artists, who were  guided by the Vulgate, represented Moses with horns. These horns  became, as it were, symbols of Moses' inspiration as a prophet.    [Footnote 12: Ibid., chapter xxxiv. verse 30. See Revised Version.]    Michelangelo followed the prevailing custom in using these curious  symbols. The long curling beard gives his hero the aspect of a poet.  The tables of stone show him to be a law-giver. But of all the  qualities of this many-sided man seen in the great statue, the most  conspicuous are his qualities of leadership,--the keen glance, the  commanding air, the alert attitude, the determined look. He seems  ready to spring to his feet if occasion demands. We see also something  of his faults, of the impulsive anger which slew the Egyptian, and  dashed in pieces the tables of stone, and of the arrogance which cost  him the privilege of entering Canaan.    He was not permitted to see his labors carried to completion, but on  the borders of Canaan \"went up into the mountain of Nebo,... and died  there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he  buried him in a valley ... over against Beth-peor; but no man knoweth  of his sepulchre unto this day.\"          V    THE HOLY FAMILY      The pictures we have thus far studied in this collection are  reproductions of works of sculpture. This is the art which  Michelangelo loved best. He was, however, a painter also, and in the  later years of his life he was even drawn into architecture. Painting  was the first art he studied, but he soon laid it aside for sculpture,  and after that returned to it from time to time throughout his life.    This picture of the Holy Family is from an oil painting. It shows us a  glimpse of the home life of the child Jesus. We have already seen in  the bas-relief of the Madonna and Child how thoughtful a mood was  sometimes upon the mother and her boy. In this picture they are making  merry together. The mother, seated on the ground, tosses the boy with  her strong arms, for her husband Joseph to catch. She is a beautiful  woman, large, and full of life and vigor. The boy is a healthy, happy  child, with perfect confidence in his mother. He rests his fat little  hands on her head to steady himself.    Joseph, bald and gray, takes the play a little more seriously, as he  gently lifts the boy from the mother's arms. He has a special care for  the child. It was he who was warned by an angel in a dream that it  was dangerous to remain in Judaea. It was he who \"took the young child  and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.\"[13] It was he again  who duly brought them back to their native country when the cruel king  was dead who had threatened the child's life. After the return from  Egypt Joseph and his family settled in the little town of Nazareth,  where he followed the trade of a carpenter.    [Footnote 13: Matthew, chapter ii. verses 13, 14.]    Now Jesus had a cousin, a boy who was not far from the same age. His  name was John, and his mission in life was closely connected with that  of Jesus. He was to grow up a great preacher, and finally to lead  people to Jesus himself. His parents knew before his birth, from an  angelic visitation, that he was to be a prophet. His mother Elizabeth,  and Mary the mother of Jesus, used to talk together, before their  children were born, of the strange future in store for them. We like  to think that the two boys grew up as companions and playmates.    It is this little boy John who is seen in the back of the picture, at  the right, coming up as if to join the child Jesus in his romp. We see  his eager little face, with the long hair blown back from it, just  above the coping stone surrounding the garden inclosure which the Holy  Family occupy. He carries over his left shoulder a slender reed cross,  such as is given him in all the old works of art as a symbol of his  prophetic character.    [Illustration: THE HOLY FAMILY. _Uffizi Gallery, Florence._]    You may say when you look at the picture that this is such a group  as you might see any day in some Tuscan village. The people are indeed  very plainly of the peasant class, and the artist did not go far out  of his way to find his figures. Perhaps he thought this was after all  the best way to show that the Holy Family was not unlike other  families in enjoying the simple pleasures of home life. We may feel a  closer sense of kinship with them on that account.    In studying the artistic qualities of this picture we have to remember  that Michelangelo was more of a sculptor than a painter, and that he  went to work upon a painting with the same methods he used in marble.  The central figures are grouped in a solid mass as if for a  bas-relief, as we may see by comparing this illustration with that of  the Madonna and Child. The mother's arms are so \"modelled,\" to use a  critical term, that they seem to start out from the canvas \"in the  round,\" just as if cut from marble. The folds of her dress, as well as  those of Joseph's garment, are arranged in the long beautiful lines  artists call \"sculpturesque.\"    The sculptor's methods are also plainly seen in the peculiarity of his  background. In a picture of this kind most painters would have painted  there a landscape, but Michelangelo did nothing of the kind. Instead  there is a semicircular parapet upon which five slender unclothed  youths are playing together. Three sit upon the wall and two lean  against it.    The figures bear no relation to the story of the picture. They are  introduced merely for the sake of decoration. To Michelangelo there  was nothing so beautiful in decoration as the human form. The lines  made by different positions of the body trace patterns more beautiful,  he thought, than any arabesques. The Greeks had the same idea when  they decorated the pediments of their temples with bas-reliefs of nude  figures. Applying this principle of sculpture to his painting,  Michelangelo arranged these boys so that their slender limbs  intertwine in graceful patterns, making a decorative background to  fill in the picture. The lightness and delicacy of the design heighten  the effect of solidity in the figures of the foreground, giving them  the prominence of figures in relief.          VI    THE PIETA      In the busy years of Christ's ministry we do not read of his often  being with his mother Mary. He was going about the country preaching  and healing, and gave himself wholly to his mission. Yet we know that  the love between mother and son was constant and unchanging. From  beginning to end she always had confidence in his power, and his  tender care for her was among his last thoughts.    On the dreadful day of the Crucifixion, the mother was found standing  by the cross, with her sister and Mary Magdalene. \"When Jesus  therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved  [that is, St. John], he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#6)"],[1,"in, however, that they are hardly at all  connected with the modern life of Islam, for it is only within the last  few years that any of them have performed the pilgrimage; and if I  include them in my lists as Sunites and Shafites it is in default of  other classification. They probably hold to the Mussulman world a  position analogous in its isolation to that of the Abyssinian Church in  Christendom. They too, however, may one day make their existence felt;  for China is no dead nation, only asleep. And with them our survey of  orthodox Islam ends.    The heretical sects remain to us. Of these the most notable without  contestation is the Shiite, or Sect of Ali, which traces its origin to  the very day of the Prophet's death, when Abu Bekr was elected Caliph to  Ali's exclusion. I will not here renew the arguments urged in this old  dispute more than to say that the dispute still exists, though it has  long ceased to be the only cause of difference between Shiah and Suni.    Beginning merely as a political schism, the Shiite sect is now  distinctly a heresy, and one which has wandered far from the orthodox  road. Their principal features of quarrel with the Sunites are--first, a  repudiation of the Caliphate and of all hierarchical authority  whatsoever; secondly, the admission of a right of free judgment in  individual doctors on matters of religion; and thirdly, a general  tendency to superstitious beliefs unauthorized by the Koran or by the  written testimony of the Prophet's companions. They also--and this is  their great doctrinal quarrel with the unitarian Sunites--believe in a  series of incarnations of the twelve qualities of God in the persons of  the \"twelve Imams,\" and in the advent of the last of them as a Messiah,  or \"Mohdy,\" doctrines which are especially advanced by the Sheykhi  school of Shiism and minimized by the Mutesharreh or orthodox. These  last matters, however, are rather excrescences than necessary parts of  Shiism. They owe their prevalence, without doubt, to the Persian mind,  which is equally prone to scepticism and credulity, and where Shiism has  always had its stronghold.    The religious constitution of the sect of Ali has been described to me  by a member of it who knows Europe well as resembling in its  organization the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. That is to say, it  acknowledges no head, temporal or spiritual, and each congregation  represents a separate unit of authority in itself. There is no such  functionary in Persia as Sheykh el Islam, or Grand Mufti, and the Shah  claims to be neither Imam nor Caliph. Each Shiite doctor who has taken  his degree at Kerbela or Ispahan may deliver his fetwa or opinion on  points of doctrine, and the only test of his authority to preach or lead  the prayer in mosque is his power of attracting a congregation. It is  strange that in a sect which had its origin in an assertion of  hereditary right to the Caliphate everything hereditary should be now  rigidly excluded.    In theory, I believe the Shias still hold that there is an Imam and  Caliph, but they will not tolerate the pretension of any one now in  authority to the title, and leave it in abeyance until the advent of the  Mohdy, or guide, who is to reunite Islam and restore its fortunes. So  much is this the case that, sovereign though he be and absolute master  in Persia, the Shah is to the present day looked upon by the Persians as  a usurper, and he himself acknowledges the fact in a rather curious  ceremony. It is a maxim with Mussulmans of all sects that prayer is not  valid if made in another man's house without his permission, and this  being so, and the Shah admitting that his palaces of right belong not to  himself but to the Mohdy, he is obliged to lease them according to legal  form from an alem or mujtahed, acting for the supposed Mohdy, before he  can pray in them to his spiritual profit.    It will be readily understood that, with such an organization and with  such tendencies to deductive reasoning, a wide basis is given for  divergence of opinion among the Shiites, and that while the more highly  educated of their mollahs occasionally preach absolute pantheism, others  consult the grosser inclinations of the vulgar, and indulge their  hearers with the most extravagant tales of miracle and superstition.  These are a constant source of mockery to the Sunites. Among the more  respectable Shiite beliefs, however, there seems to be a general  conviction in Persia that a reform of Islam is at hand, and that a new  leader may be expected at any moment and from any quarter, so that  enthusiasts are constantly found simulating the gifts of inspiration and  affecting a divine mission. The history of the Babites, so well  described by M. de Gobineau in his _Religions of Asia_, is a case in  point, and similar occurrences are by no means rare in Persia.    I met at Jeddah a highly educated Persian gentleman, who informed me  that he had himself been witness when a boy to a religious prodigy,  notorious, if I remember rightly, at Tabriz. On that occasion, one of  these prophets being condemned to death by the supreme government, was  bound to a cross with two of his companions, and after remaining  suspended thus for several hours, was fired at by the royal troops. It  then happened that, while the companions were dispatched at the first  volley, the prophet himself remained unhurt, and, incredible to relate,  the cords which bound him were cut by the bullets, and he fell to the  ground on his feet. \"You Christians,\" said another Persian gentleman  once to me, \"talk of your Christ as the Son of God and think it  strange, but with us the occurrence is a common one. Believe me we have  'sons of God' in nearly all our villages.\"    Thus, with the Shiites, extremes meet. No Moslems more readily adapt  themselves to the superficial atheisms of Europe than do the Persians,  and none are more ardently devout, as all who have witnessed the miracle  play of the two Imams will be obliged to admit. Extremes, too, of  morality are seen, fierce asceticisms and gross licentiousnesses. By no  sect of Islam is the duty of pilgrimage more religiously observed, or  the prayers and ablutions required by their rule performed with a  stricter ritual. But the very pilgrims who go on foot to Mecca scruple  not to drink wine there, and Persian morality is everywhere a byword.    In all these circumstances there is much to fear as well as to hope on  the side of the Shiite sect; but their future only indirectly involves  that of Islam proper. Their whole census does not probably exceed  fifteen millions, and it shows no tendency to increase. Outside Persia  we find about one million Iraki Arabs, a few in Syria and Afghanistan,  and at most five millions in India. One small group still maintains  itself in the neighbourhood of Medina, where it is tolerated rather than  acknowledged, and a few Shiites are to be found in most of the large  cities of the west, but everywhere the sect of Ali stands apart from and  almost in a hostile attitude to the rest of Islam. It is noticeable,  however, that within the last fifty years the religious bitterness of  Shiite and Sunite is sensibly in decline.    The next most important of the heretical sects is the Abadiyeh. These,  according to some, are the religious descendants of the Khawarij, a sect  which separated itself from the Califate in the time of the Seyid Ali,  and, after a severe persecution in Irak, took refuge at last in Oman.  Whatever their present doctrines, they seem at first to have been like  the Shiites, political schismatics. They maintained that any Mussulman,  so long as he was not affected with heresy, might be chosen Imam, and  that he might be deposed for heresy or ill-conduct, and indeed that  there was no absolute necessity for any Imam at all. They are at present  only found in Oman and Zanzibar, where they number, it is said, about  four millions. Till as late as the last century the Imamate was an  elective office among them, but with the accession of the Abu Said  dynasty it became hereditary in that family.[8] They reject all  communion with the Sunites, but I have not been able to discover that  they hold any doctrines especially offensive to the mass of Moslems.  Their differences are mainly negative, and consist in the rejection of  Califal history and authority later than the reign of Omar, and of a  vast number of traditions now incorporated in the Sunite faith.    Allied to them but, as I understood, separate, are the Zeidites of  Yemen, who are possibly also descended from the Khawarij. But, as the  Zeidites are accustomed to conceal the fact of their heresy and to pass  themselves when on pilgrimage as Sunites, I could learn little about  them. They were, till ten years ago, independent under the Imams of  Sana, and it is certain that they repudiate the Califate. In former  times, before the first conquest of Arabia by the Turks, these Imams  were all powerful in Hejaz, and on the destruction of the Bagdad  Califate assumed the title of Hami el Harameyn, protector of the holy  places. The Turks, however, now occupy Sana, and the office of Imam is  in abeyance. The Zeidites can hardly number more than two millions, and  their only importance in the future lies in the fact of their  geographical proximity to Mecca, and in the fact that their sympathies  lie on the side of liberality in opinion and reform in morals. Neither  Zeidites nor Abadites have any adherents out of their own countries.    Of the Wahhabites a more detailed account is needed, as although their  numbers are small and their political importance less than it formerly  was, the spirit of their reform movement still lives and exercises a  potent influence on modern Mohammedan ideas. I have described  elsewhere[9] the historical vicissitudes of the sect in Arabia, and the  decline of its fortunes in Nejd, but a brief recapitulation of these may  be allowed me."]]]
