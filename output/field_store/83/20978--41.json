[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#6)"],[1,"garries,  or for Millaird either. I will try my plan first.\"    The urgency in Kurt's protest carried Ross past the wavering point. He,  too, would try the cat. He was only familiar with this time and world;  he had no desire to be sent into another one.    Once Ross had made his decision, Kurt hurried him into action. Kurt's  knowledge of the secret procedures at the base proved excellent. Twice  they were halted by locked doors, but only momentarily, for Kurt had a  tiny gadget, concealed in the palm of his hand, which had only to be  held over a latch to open a recalcitrant door.    There was enough light in the corridors to give them easy passage, but  the rooms were dark, and twice Kurt had to lead Ross by the hand,  avoiding furniture or installations with the surety of one who had  practiced that same route often. Murdock's opinion of his companion's  ability underwent several upward revisions during that tour, and he  began to believe that he was really in luck to have found such a  partner.    In the last room, Ross willingly followed Kurt's orders to put on the  fur clothing Kurt passed to him. The fit was not exact, but he surmised  that Kurt had chosen as well as possible. A final door opened, and they  stepped out into the polar night of winter. Kurt's mittened hand grasped  Ross's, pulling him along. Together, they pushed back the door of a  hangar shed to get at their escape vehicle.    The cat was a strange machine, but Ross was given no time to study it.  He was shoved into the cockpit, a bubble covering settled down over  them, closing them in, and the engine came to life under Kurt's urging.  The cat must be traveling at its best pace, Ross thought. Yet the crawl  which took them away from the mounded snow covering the base seemed  hardly better than a man could make afoot.    For a short time Kurt headed straight away from the starting point, but  Ross soon heard him counting slowly to himself as if he were timing  something. At the count of twenty the cat swung to the right and made a  wide half circle which was copied at the next count of twenty by a  similar sweep in the opposite direction. After this pattern had been  repeated for six turns, Ross found it difficult to guess whether they  had ever returned to their first course. When Kurt stopped counting he  asked, \"Why the dance pattern?\"    \"Would you rather be scattered in little pieces all over the landscape?\"  the other snapped. \"The base doesn't need fences two miles high to keep  us in, or others out; they take other precautions. You should thank  fortune we got through that first mine field without blowing....\"    Ross swallowed, but he refused to let Kurt know that he was rattled. \"So  it isn't as easy to get away as you said?\"    \"Shut up!\" Kurt began counting again, and Ross had some cold  apprehensive moments in which to reflect upon the folly of quick  decisions and wonder bleakly why he had not thought things through  before he leaped.    Again they sketched a weaving pattern in the snow, but this time the  arcs formed acute angles. Ross glanced now and then at the intent man at  the wheel. How had Kurt managed to memorize this route? His urge to  escape the base must certainly be a strong one.    Back and forth they crawled, gaining only a few yards in each of those  angled strikes to right or left.    \"Good thing these cats are atomic powered,\" Kurt commented during one of  the intervals between mine fields. \"We'd run out of fuel otherwise.\"    Ross fought down the impulse to move his feet away from any possible  contact point with the engine. These machines must be safe to ride in,  but the bogy of radiation was frightening. Luckily, Kurt was now back to  a straight track, with no more weaving.    \"We are out!\" Kurt said with exultation. But he added no more than just  the reassurance of their escape.    The cat crawled on. To Ross's eyes there was no trail to follow, no  guideposts, yet Kurt steered ahead with confidence. A little later he  pulled to a stop and said to Ross, \"We have to drive turn and turn  about--your turn.\"    Ross was dubious. \"Well, I can drive a car--but this----\"    \"Is fool proof.\" Kurt caught him up. \"The worst was getting through the  mine fields, and we are out of that now. See here--\" his hand made a  shadow on the lighted instrument panel, \"this will keep you straight. If  you can steer a car, you can steer this. Watch!\" He started up again and  once more swung the cat to the left.    A light on the panel began to blink at a rate which increased rapidly as  they veered farther away from their original course.    \"See? You keep that light steady, and you are on course. If it begins to  blink, you cast about until it steadies again. Simple enough for a baby.  Take over and see.\"    It was hard to change places in the sealed cabin of the cat, but they  were successful, and Ross took the wheel gingerly. Following Kurt's  directions, he started ahead, his eyes focused on the light rather than  the white expanse before him. And after a few minutes of strain he  caught the hang of it. As Kurt had promised, it was very simple. After  watching him for a while, his instructor gave a grunt of satisfaction  and settled down for a nap.    Once the first excitement of driving the cat wore off, the operation  tended to become monotonous. Ross caught himself yawning, but he kept at  his post with dogged stubbornness. This had been Kurt's game all the way  through--so far--and he was certainly not going to resign his first  chance to show that he could be of use also. If there had only been some  break in the eternal snow, some passing light or goal to be seen ahead,  it would not have been so bad. Finally, every now and then, Ross had to  jiggle off course just enough so that the warning blink of light would  alert him and keep him from falling asleep. He was unaware that Kurt had  awakened during one of those maneuvers until the other spoke. \"Your own  private alarm clock, Murdock? Okay, I do not quarrel with anyone who  uses his head. But you had better get some shut-eye, or we will not keep  rolling.\"    Ross was too tired to protest. They changed places, and he curled up as  best he could on his small share of seat. Only now that he was free to  sleep, he realized he no longer wanted to. Kurt must have thought Ross  had fallen asleep, for after perhaps two miles of steady grinding along,  he moved cautiously behind the wheel. Ross saw by the trace of light  from the instrument panel that his companion was digging into the breast  of his parka to bring out a small object which he held against the wheel  of the cat with one hand, while with the other he tapped out an  irregular rhythm.    To Ross the action made no sense. But he did not miss the other's sigh  of relief as he restored his treasure to hiding once more, as if some  difficult task was now behind him. Shortly afterward the cat ground to  a stop, and Ross sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"What's the matter? Engine  trouble?\"    Kurt had folded his arms across the wheel. \"No. It is just that we are  to wait here----\"    \"Wait? For what? Kelgarries to come along and pick us up?\"    Kurt laughed. \"The major? How I wish that he _would_ arrive presently.  What a surprise he would receive! Not two little mice to be put back  into their cages, but the tiger cat, all claws and fangs!\"    Ross sat up straighter. This now had the bad smell of a frame, a frame  with himself planted right in the middle. He figured out the  possibilities and came up with an answer which would smear Ross Murdock  all over any map. If Kurt were waiting to meet friends out here, they  could only be of one brand.    For most of his short life Ross had been engaged in a private war  against the restrictions imposed upon him by a set of legal rules to  which something within him would not conform. And he had, during those  same years filled with attacks, retreats, and strategic maneuvering,  formulated a code of rules by which to play his dangerous game. He had  not murdered, and he would never follow the path Kurt took. To one who  was supremely impatient of restraint, the methods and aims of Kurt's  employers were not only impossibly fantastic and illogical--they were to  be opposed to the last ounce of any man's energy.    \"Your friends late?\" He tried to sound casual.    \"Not yet, and if you now plan to play the hero, Murdock, think better of  it!\" Kurt's tone held the crack of an order--that note Ross had so much  disliked in the major's voice. \"This is an operation which has been most  carefully planned and upon which a great deal depends. No one shall  spoil it for us now----\"    \"The Reds planted you on the project, eh?\" Ross wanted to keep the other  talking to give himself a chance to think. And this was one time he had  to think, clearly and with speed.    \"There is no need for me to tell you the sad tale of my life, Murdock.  And you would doubtless find much of it boring. If you wish to continue  to live--for a while, at least--you will remain quiet and do as you are  told.\"    Kurt must be armed, for he would not be so confident unless he had a  weapon he could now turn on Ross. On the other hand, if what Ross  guessed were true, this _was_ the time to play the hero--when there was  only Kurt to handle. Better to be a dead hero than a live captive in the  hands of Kurt's dear friends across the pole.    Without warning, Ross threw his body to the left, striving to pin Kurt  against the driver's side of the cabin, his hands clawing at the fur  ruff bordering the other's hood, trying for a throat hold. Perhaps it  was Kurt's over-confidence which betrayed him and left him open to a  surprise attack. He struggled hard to bring up his arm, but both his  weight and Ross's held him tight. Ross caught at his wrist, noticing a  gleam of metal.    They threshed about, the bulkiness of the fur clothing hampering them.  Ross wondered fleetingly why the other had not made sure of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#6)"],[1," she must yet again become the England she was once, and in all  beautiful ways,--more: so happy, so secluded, and so pure, that in her  sky--polluted by no unholy clouds--she may be able to spell rightly of  every star that heaven doth show; and in her fields, ordered and wide  and fair, of every herb that sips the dew; and under the green avenues  of her enchanted garden, a sacred Circe, true Daughter of the Sun, she  must guide the human arts, and gather the divine knowledge, of distant  nations, transformed from savageness to manhood, and redeemed from  despairing into peace.      30. You think that an impossible ideal. Be it so; refuse to accept it if  you will; but see that you form your own in its stead. All that I ask of  you is to have a fixed purpose of some kind for your country and  yourselves; no matter how restricted, so that it be fixed and unselfish.  I know what stout hearts are in you, to answer acknowledged need: but it  is the fatallest form of error in English youths to hide their hardihood  till it fades for lack of sunshine, and to act in disdain of purpose,  till all purpose is vain. It is not by deliberate, but by careless  selfishness; not by compromise with evil, but by dull following of good,  that the weight of national evil increases upon us daily. Break through  at least this pretence of existence; determine what you will be, and  what you would win. You will not decide wrongly if you will resolve to  decide at all. Were even the choice between lawless pleasure and loyal  suffering, you would not, I believe, choose basely. But your trial is  not so sharp. It is between drifting in confused wreck among the  castaways of Fortune, who condemns to assured ruin those who know not  either how to resist her, or obey; between this, I say, and the taking  of your appointed part in the heroism of Rest; the resolving to share in  the victory which is to the weak rather than the strong; and the binding  yourselves by that law, which, thought on through lingering night and  labouring day, makes a man's life to be as a tree planted by the  water-side, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;--         \"ET FOLIUM EJUS NON DEFLUET,        ET OMNIA, QUAECUNQUE FACIET, PROSPERABUNTUR.\"          LECTURE II    THE RELATION OF ART TO RELIGION      31. It was stated, and I trust partly with your acceptance, in my  opening lecture, that the study on which we are about to enter cannot be  rightly undertaken except in furtherance of the grave purposes of life  with respect to which the rest of the scheme of your education here is  designed. But you can scarcely have at once felt all that I intended in  saying so;--you cannot but be still partly under the impression that the  so-called fine arts are merely modes of graceful recreation, and a new  resource for your times of rest. Let me ask you, forthwith, so far as  you can trust me, to change your thoughts in this matter. All the great  arts have for their object either the support or exaltation of human  life,--usually both; and their dignity, and ultimately their very  existence, depend on their being \"+meta logou alethous+,\" that is  to say, apprehending, with right reason, the nature of the materials  they work with, of the things they relate or represent, and of the  faculties to which they are addressed. And farther, they form one united  system from which it is impossible to remove any part without harm to  the rest. They are founded first in mastery, by strength of _arm_, of  the earth and sea, in agriculture and seamanship; then their inventive  power begins, with the clay in the hand of the potter, whose art is the  humblest but truest type of the forming of the human body and spirit;  and in the carpenter's work, which probably was the early employment of  the Founder of our religion. And until men have perfectly learned the  laws of art in clay and wood, they can consummately know no others. Nor  is it without the strange significance which you will find in what at  first seems chance, in all noble histories, as soon as you can read  them rightly,--that the statue of Athena Polias was of olive-wood, and  that the Greek temple and Gothic spire are both merely the permanent  representations of useful wooden structures. On these two first arts  follow building in stone,--sculpture,--metal work,--and painting; every  art being properly called \"fine\" which demands the exercise of the full  faculties of heart and intellect. For though the fine arts are not  necessarily imitative or representative, for their essence is in being  +peri genesin+--occupied in the actual _production_ of beautiful  form or colour,--still, the highest of them are appointed also to relate  to us the utmost ascertainable truth respecting visible things and moral  feelings: and this pursuit of _fact_ is the vital _element_ of the art  power;--that in which alone it can develop itself to its utmost. And I  will anticipate by an assertion which you will at present think too  bold, but which I am willing that you should think so, in order that you  may well remember it,--THE HIGHEST THING THAT ART CAN DO IS TO SET  BEFORE YOU THE TRUE IMAGE OF THE PRESENCE OF A NOBLE HUMAN BEING. IT HAS  NEVER DONE MORE THAN THIS, AND IT OUGHT NOT TO DO LESS.      32. The great arts--forming thus one perfect scheme of human skill, of  which it is not right to call one division more honourable, though it  may be more subtle, than another--have had, and can have, but three  principal directions of purpose:--first, that of enforcing the religion  of men; secondly, that of perfecting their ethical state; thirdly, that  of doing them material service.      33. I do not doubt but that you are surprised at my saying the arts can  in their second function only be directed to the perfecting of ethical  state, it being our usual impression that they are often destructive of  morality. But it is impossible to direct fine art to an immoral end,  except by giving it characters unconnected with its fineness, or by  addressing it to persons who cannot perceive it to be fine. Whosoever  recognises it is exalted by it. On the other hand, it has been commonly  thought that art was a most fitting means for the enforcement of  religious doctrines and emotions; whereas there is, as I must presently  try to show you, room for grave doubt whether it has not in this  function hitherto done evil rather than good.      34. In this and the two next following lectures, I shall endeavour  therefore to show you the grave relations of human art, in these three  functions, to human life. I can do this but roughly, as you may well  suppose--since each of these subjects would require for its right  treatment years instead of hours. Only, remember, _I_ have already given  years, not a few, to each of them; and what I try to tell _you_ now will  be only so much as is absolutely necessary to set our work on a clear  foundation. You may not, at present, see the necessity for _any_  foundation, and may think that I ought to put pencil and paper in your  hands at once. On that point I must simply answer, \"Trust me a little  while,\" asking you however also to remember, that--irrespectively of any  consideration of last or first--my true function here is not that of  your master in painting, or sculpture, or pottery; but to show you what  it is that makes any of these arts _fine_, or the contrary of _fine_:  essentially _good_, or essentially _base_. You need not fear my not  being practical enough for you; all the industry you choose to give me,  I will take; but far the better part of what you may gain by such  industry would be lost, if I did not first lead you to see what every  form of art-industry intends, and why some of it is justly called right,  and some wrong.      35. It would be well if you were to look over, with respect to this  matter, the end of the second, and what interests you of the third, book  of Plato's Republic; noting therein these two principal things, of which  I have to speak in this and my next lecture: first, the power which  Plato so frankly, and quite justly, attributes to art, of _falsifying_  our conceptions of Deity: which power he by fatal error partly implies  may be used wisely for good, and that the feigning is only wrong when it  is of evil, \"+ean tis me kalos pseudetai+;\" and you may trace  through all that follows the beginning of the change of Greek ideal art  into a beautiful expediency, instead of what it was in the days of  Pindar, the statement of what \"could not be otherwise than so.\" But, in  the second place, you will find in those books of the Polity, stated  with far greater accuracy of expression than our English language  admits, the essential relations of art to morality; the sum of these  being given in one lovely sentence, which, considering that we have  to-day grace done us by fair companionship,[3] you will pardon me for  translating. \"_Must it be then only with our poets that we insist they  shall either create for us the image of a noble morality, or among us  create none? or shall we not also keep guard over all other workers for  the people, and forbid them to make what is ill-customed, and  unrestrained, and ungentle, and without order or shape, either in  likeness of living things, or in buildings, or in any other thing  whatsoever that is made for the people? and shall we not rather seek for  workers who_ CAN TRACK THE INNER NATURE OF ALL THAT MAY BE SWEETLY  SCHEMED; _so that the young men, as living in a wholesome place, may be  profited by everything that, in work fairly wrought, may touch them  through hearing or sight--as if it were a breeze bringing health to them  from places strong for life?_\"    [Footnote 3: There were, in fact, a great many more girls than  University men at the lectures.]      36. And now--but one word, before we enter on our task, as to the way  you must understand what I may endeavour to tell you.    Let me beg you--now and always--no"]]]
