Nor have they ever  found, or will ever find, a friend or helper.    55 Had these souls but clung steadfastly to the Handle of God manifested  in the Person of Muhammad, had they turned wholly unto God and cast aside  all that they had learned from their divines, He would assuredly have  guided them through His grace and acquainted them with the sacred truths  that are enshrined within His imperishable utterances. For far be it from  His greatness and His glory that He should turn away a seeker at His door,  cast aside from His Threshold one who hath set his hopes on Him, reject  one who hath sought the shelter of His shade, deprive one who hath held  fast to the hem of His mercy, or condemn to remoteness the poor one who  hath found the river of His riches. But as these people failed to turn  wholly unto God, and to hold fast to the hem of His all-pervading mercy at  the appearance of the Daystar of Truth, they passed out from under the  shadow of guidance and entered the city of error. Thus did they become  corrupt and corrupt the people. Thus did they err and lead the people into  error. And thus were they recorded among the oppressors in the books of  heaven.    56 Now that this evanescent One hath reached this exalted point in the  exposition of the inner mysteries, the reason for the denial of these  uncouth souls will be described briefly, that it may serve as a testimony  unto them that are endued with understanding and insight, and be a token  of My favour unto the concourse of the faithful.    57 Know then that when Muhammad, the Point of the Qur'an and the Light of  the All-Glorious, came with perspicuous verses and luminous proofs  manifested in such signs as are beyond the power of all existence to  produce, He bade all men follow this lofty and outstretched Path in  accordance with the precepts that He had brought from God. Whoso  acknowledged Him, recognized the signs of God in His inmost Being, and saw  in His beauty the changeless beauty of God, the decree of \"resurrection\",  \"ingathering\", \"life\", and \"paradise\" was passed upon him. For he who had  believed in God and in the Manifestation of His beauty was raised from the  grave of heedlessness, gathered together in the sacred ground of the  heart, quickened to the life of faith and certitude, and admitted into the  paradise of the divine presence. What paradise can be loftier than this,  what ingathering mightier, and what resurrection greater? Indeed, should a  soul be acquainted with these mysteries, he would grasp that which none  other hath fathomed.    58 Know then that the paradise that appeareth in the day of God surpasseth  every other paradise and excelleth the realities of Heaven. For when  God--blessed and glorified is He--sealed the station of prophethood in the  person of Him Who was His Friend, His Chosen One, and His Treasure amongst  His creatures, as hath been revealed from the Kingdom of glory: \"but He is  the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets\",(37) He promised all men  that they shall attain unto His own presence in the Day of Resurrection.  In this He meant to emphasize the greatness of the Revelation to come, as  it hath indeed been manifested through the power of truth. And there is of  a certainty no paradise greater than this, nor station higher, should ye  reflect upon the verses of the Qur'an. Blessed be he who knoweth of a  certainty that he shall attain unto the presence of God on that day when  His Beauty shall be made manifest.    59 Were I to recount all the verses that have been revealed in connection  with this exalted theme, it would weary the reader and divert Us from Our  purpose. The following verse shall therefore suffice Us; may thine eyes be  solaced therewith, and mayest thou attain unto that which hath been  treasured and concealed therein: \"It is God who hath reared the heavens  without pillars thou canst behold; then mounted His throne, and imposed  laws on the sun and moon: each travelleth to its appointed goal. He  ordereth all things. He maketh His signs clear, that ye may have firm  faith in the presence of your Lord.\"(38)    60 Ponder then, O My friend, the words \"firm faith\" that have been  mentioned in this verse. It saith that the heavens and the earth, the  throne, the sun and the moon, all have been created to the end that His  servants may have unswerving faith in His presence in His days. By the  righteousness of God! Contemplate, O My brother, the greatness of this  station, and behold the condition of the people in these days, fleeing  from the Countenance of God and His Beauty \"as though they were affrighted  asses\".(39) Wert thou to reflect upon that which We have revealed unto  thee, thou wouldst undoubtedly grasp Our purpose in this utterance and  discover that which We have desired to impart unto thee within this  paradise. Perchance thine eyes may rejoice in beholding it, thine ears  take delight in hearing that which is recited therein, thy soul be  enthralled by recognizing it, thy heart illumined by comprehending it, and  thy spirit gladdened by the fragrant breezes that waft therefrom. Haply  thou mayest attain unto the pinnacle of divine grace and abide within the  Ridvan of transcendent holiness.    61 He, however, who denied God in His Truth, who turned his back upon Him  and rebelled, who disbelieved and made mischief, the verdict of \"impiety\",  \"blasphemy\", \"death\", and \"fire\" was passed upon him. For, what blasphemy  is greater than to turn unto the manifestations of Satan, to follow the  doctors of oblivion and the people of rebellion? What impiety is more  grievous than to deny the Lord on the day when faith itself is renewed and  regenerated by God, the Almighty, the Beneficent? What death is more  wretched than to flee from the Source of everlasting life? What fire is  fiercer on the Day of Reckoning than that of remoteness from the divine  Beauty and the celestial Glory?    62 These were the very words and utterances used by the pagan Arabs living  in the days of Muhammad to dispute with and pronounce judgement against  Him. They said: \"Those who believed in Muhammad dwelt in our midst and  associated with us day and night. When did they die and when were they  raised again to life?\" Hearken unto that which was revealed in reply: \"If  ever thou dost marvel, marvellous surely is their saying, 'What! When we  have become dust and mouldering bones, shall we be restored in a new  creation?'\"(40) And in another passage: \"And if thou shouldst say, 'After  death ye shall surely be raised again', the infidels will certainly  exclaim, 'This is naught but palpable sorcery.'\"(41) Thus did they mock  and deride Him, for they had read in their Books and heard from their  divines the terms \"life\" and \"death\", and understood them as this  elemental life and physical death, and hence when they found not that  which their vain imaginings and their false and wicked minds had  conceived, they hoisted the banners of discord and the standards of  sedition and kindled the flame of war. God, however, quenched it through  the power of His might, as thou seest again in this day with these  infidels and evil-doers.    63 At this hour, when the sweet savours of attraction have wafted over Me  from the everlasting city, when transports of yearning have seized Me from  the land of splendours at the dawning of the Daystar of the worlds above  the horizon of 'Iraq, and the sweet melodies of Hijaz have brought to Mine  ears the mysteries of separation, I have purposed to relate unto thine  eminence a portion of that which the Mystic Dove hath warbled in the  midmost heart of Paradise as to the true meaning of life and death, though  the task be impossible. For were I to interpret these words for thee as it  hath been inscribed in the Guarded Tablets, all the books and pages of the  world could not contain it, nor could the souls of men bear its weight. I  shall nonetheless mention that which beseemeth this day and age, that it  might serve as a guidance unto whosoever desireth to gain admittance into  the retreats of glory in the realms above, to hearken unto the melodies of  the spirit intoned by this divine and mystic bird, and to be numbered with  those who have severed themselves from all save God and who in this day  rejoice in the presence of their Lord.    64 Know then that \"life\" hath a twofold meaning. The first pertaineth to  the appearance of man in an elemental body, and is as manifest to thine  eminence and to others as the midday sun. This life cometh to an end with  physical death, which is a God-ordained and inescapable reality. That  life, however, which is mentioned in the Books of the Prophets and the  Chosen Ones of God is the life of knowledge; that is to say, the servant's  recognition of the sign of the splendours wherewith He Who is the Source  of all splendour hath Himself invested him, and his certitude of attaining  unto the presence of God through the Manifestations of His Cause. This is  that blessed and everlasting life that perisheth not: whosoever is  quickened thereby shall never die, but will endure as long as His Lord and  Creator will endure.    65 The first life, which pertaineth to the elemental body, will come to an  end, as hath been revealed by God: \"Every soul shall taste of death.\"(42)  But the second life, which ariseth from the knowledge of God, knoweth no  death, as hath been revealed aforetime: \"Him will We surely quicken to a  blessed life.\"(43) And in another passage concerning the martyrs: \"Nay,  they are alive and sustained by their Lord.\"(44) And from the Traditions:  \"He who is a true believer liveth both in this world and in the world to  come.\"(45) Numerous examples of similar words are to be found in the Books  of God and of the Embodiments of His justice.

An ox which gores someone to death shall be stoned.    If one steals or slays another's ox, he must give two oxen for  it.    \"If any one steals so that his wife and children don't know it,  he shall pay 60 shillings as wite.

If he is an eorldormen, he shall  forfeit his shire, unless the King is willing to be merciful to  him.\"      Judicial Procedure    Cases were held at monthly meetings of the community [folk-moot].  The King or his representative in the community, called the  \"reeve\", conducted the trial by compurgation.    The one complaining, called the \"plaintiff\", and the one  defending, called the \"defendant\", each told their story and put  his hand on the Bible and swore \"By God this oath is clean and  true\". A slip or a stammer would mean he lost the case.  Otherwise, community members would stand up to swear on behalf of  the plaintiff or the defendant as to their reputation for  veracity. If these \"compurgators\" were too few, usually twelve  in number, or recited poorly, their party lost.    If this process was inconclusive, the defendant was told to go to  church and to take the sacrament only if he were innocent. If he  took the sacrament, he was tried by the process of \"ordeal\". In  the ordeal by cold water, he was bound hand and foot and then  thrown into water. If he floated, he was guilty. If he sank, he  was innocent. It was not necessary to drown to be deemed  innocent. In the ordeal by hot water, he had to pick up a stone  from inside a boiling cauldron. If his hand was healing in three  days, he was innocent. If it was festering, he was guilty. A  similar ordeal was that of hot iron, in which one had to carry in  his hands a hot iron for a certain distance. Although the results  of the ordeal were taken to indicate the will of God, the  official conducting the ordeal could adjust its parameters so  that a person with a guilty demeanor would be found guilty and a  person with an innocent demeanor found innocent. The ordeal seems  to favor the physically fit, because a person who was not fat  would tend to sink and a person who was in good health would  have prompt healing of burns. Presumably a person convicted of  murder, i.e. killing by stealth, or robbery [taking from a  person's robe, that is, his person or breaking into his home to  steal] would be hung and his possessions confiscated.    The issue of rights to herd pigs to feed in certain woodland was  heard in this lawsuit:    \"In the year 825 which had passed since the birth of Christ, and  in the course of the second Indiction, and during the reign of  Beornwulf, King of Mercia, a council meeting was held in the  famous place called Clofesho, and there the said King Beornwulf  and his bishops and his earls and all the councilors of this  nation were assembled. Then there was a very noteworthy suit  about wood-pasture at Sinton, towards the west in Scirhylte. The  reeves in charge of the pigherds wished to extend the pasture  farther, and take in more of the wood than the ancient rights  permitted. Then the bishop and the advisors of the community said  that they would not admit liability for more than had been  appointed in AEthelbald's day, namely mast for 300 swine, and  that the bishop and the community should have two-thirds of the  wood and of the mast. They Archbishop Wulfred and all the  councilors determined that the bishop and the community might  declare on oath that it was so appointed in AEthelbald's time and  that they were not trying to obtain more, and the bishop  immediately gave security to Earl Eadwulf to furnish the oath  before all the councilors, and it was produced in 30 days at the  bishop's see at Worcester. At that time Hama was the reeve in  charge of the pigherds at Sinton, and he rode until he reached  Worcester, and watched and observed the oath, as Earl Eadwulf  bade him, but did not challenge it.    Here are the names and designations of those who were assembled  at the council meeting ...\"            Chapter 3    The Times: 900-1066    There were many large landholders such as the King, earls [Danish  word for Saxon word \"eorldormen\"], and bishops. Earls were  noblemen by birth, and often relatives of the King. They were  his army commanders and the highest civil officials, each  responsible for a shire. A breach of the peace of an eorldorman  would occasion a fine. Lower in social status were freemen, then  sokemen, and then, in decreasing order, villani, bordarii,  cottarii, and servi (slaves).    There was a great expansion of arable land. Some land was common  land, held by communities. If a family came to pay the dues and  fines on it, it became personal to that family and was known as  heir land.    Kings typically granted land in exchange for services of military  duties, repairing of fortresses, and work on bridges. Less  common services required by landlords include equipping a guard  ship and guarding the coast, guarding the lord, military watch,  maintaining the deer fence at the King's residence, alms giving,  and church dues. Since this land was granted in return for  service, there were limitations on its heritability and often an  heir had to pay a heriot to the landlord to obtain the land. A  heriot was originally the armor of a man killed, which went to  the King.    There were several thousand thegns, rich and poor, who held land  directly of the King. Free farmers who had sought protection  from thegns in time of war now took them as their lords. A free  man could chose his lord, following him in war and working his  land in peace. In return, the lord would protect him against  encroaching neighbors, back him in the courts of law, and feed  him in times of famine. Often knights stayed with their lords at  their large houses, but later were given land with men on it.  The lords were the ruling class and the greatest of them sat in  the King's council along with bishops, abbots, and officers of  the King's household. The lesser lords were local magnates, who  officiated at the shire and hundred courts.    A free holder's house was wood, perhaps with a stone foundation,  and roofed with thatch or tiles. There was a main room or hall,  with bed chambers around it. Beyond was the kitchen, perhaps  outside under a lean-to. These buildings were surrounded by a  bank or stiff hedge.    Simple people lived in huts made from wood and mud, with one door  and no windows. They slept around a fire in the middle of the  earthen floor. They wore shapeless clothes of goat-hair and  unprocessed wool. They ate rough brown bread, vegetable broth,  small-ale from barley, bacon, beans, milk, cabbage, onion, and  honey for sweetening or mead. In the summer, they ate boiled or  raw veal and wild fowl and game snared in the forest. In the  fall, they slaughtered and salted their cattle for food during  the winter because there was no more pasture for them. However,  some cows and breed animals were kept through the winter.    Folk land was that land that was left over after allotments had  been made to the freemen and which was not common land. Book  land was called such because this holding was written down in  books. This land was usually land that had been given to the  church or monasteries because the church had personnel who could  write. So many thegns gave land to the church, usually a hide,  that the church had 1/3 of the land.    An example of a grant of hides of land is: \"[God has endowed King  Edred with England], wherefore he enriches and honors men, both  ecclesiastic and lay, who can justly deserve it. The truth of  this can be acknowledged by the thegn AElfsige Hunlafing through  his acquisition of the estate of 5 hides at Alwalton for himself  and his heirs, free from every burden except the repair of  fortifications, the building of bridges and military service; a  prudent landowner church dues, burial fees and tithes. [This  land] is to be held for all time and granted along with the  things both great and small belonging to it.\"    A Bishop gave land to a faithful attendant for his life and two  other lives as follows: \"In 904 A.D., I, Bishop Werfrith, with  the permission and leave of my honorable community in Worcester,  grant to Wulfsige, my reeve, for his loyal efficiency and humble  obedience, one hide of land at Aston as Herred held it, that is,  surrounded by a dyke, for three lives and then after three lives  the estate shall be given back without any controversy to  Worcester.\"    The lands of the large landholding lords were administered by  freemen. They had wheat, barley, oats, and rye fields, orchards,  vineyards, and bee-keeping areas for honey. Hand mills and/or  water mills were used for grinding grain. On this land lived not  only farm laborers, cattle herders, shepherds, goatherds, and  pigherds, but craftsmen such as goldsmiths, hawk-keepers,  dog-keepers, horse- keepers, huntsmen, foresters, builders,  weaponsmiths, embroiderers, bronze smiths, blacksmiths,"]]]
