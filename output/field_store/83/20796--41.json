Its function seems to be the formation of certain military  qualities which Patriotism and the Sense of Duty are by themselves  believed incapable of creating. It has always been considered an  essential part of a soldier's training; but this view, though probably  correct, is not confirmed by the South African War, in which an  undisciplined force held its own for some years against greatly superior  numbers of disciplined men.    The ideal Army, patriotic, full of the sense of Duty, and perfect in  discipline, would be invincible; but such an Army has never yet been  seen. A deficiency of one or two of these qualities may be made up for  by a fuller measure of the others. The history of each war will seem to  indicate for a time the proportions in which the qualities should be  blended, which is the essential, and whether any one of them can be  omitted; but the inferences thus drawn from one war will probably be  found misleading in the next war.    The inference to be drawn from the South African War seems to be that  the value of those military qualities which are created by Discipline  and training has been over-rated, and that a passionate bigoted belief  in the justice of a cause is a more potent factor in the making of a  soldier. Even if every allowance be made for the strategical advantages  possessed by the Boers, of fighting in their own land on interior lines  in a sparsely populated country peculiarly adopted for _guerilla_, it is  difficult to account for their success if the tests by which the  efficiency of a European army is measured are applied to them. It may be  that war has hitherto been regarded too exclusively as a statical and  dynamical problem and that the moral element has been overlooked. It  certainly was overlooked in South Africa; for the war which Lord Roberts  in October, 1900, believed was practically at an end had in fact then  run little more than one-third of its course.        III. WAR CONSIDERED AS A BRANCH OF SPORT      The astonishment, distress, chagrin and bewilderment caused by want of  success, \"regrettable incidents,\" and disasters, sometimes found  consolation during the South African War in the foolish remark--The  Germans would have done no better. What the German Army, which had not  been actively employed for twenty-eight years, might have accomplished  under the same conditions is a matter for sterile speculation which has  little bearing on the case. But the German Army certainly had not been  accustomed to look upon War as a branch of Sport or Athletics.    Owing in all probability to the happy fact in History that England has  not been invaded and over-run by a foreign army since the time of  William the Conqueror--an episode which had in the end an excellent  influence on the national life--she has never taken the military art  seriously. She alone, thanks to the protection of Providence, has never  been compelled to fight on her own fields for her existence as a nation;  she alone knows nothing even by tradition handed down from distant  generations of the appearance of an alien soldier on her shores.[10]  Some of her wars, as for example the successful struggle by which the  Napoleonic domination was broken up, have been fought for the purpose of  safe-guarding her independence, but they were not popular with the  people at large, whose short sight did not permit them to see that a  defensive war may have to be fought beyond the seas; and they had little  or no effect in evoking a patriotic military spirit. Napoleon's gibe  that the English were a nation of shopkeepers was not unasked for, and  is still seasonable.    On the other hand there are hundreds of thousands of persons on the  Continent of Europe who have seen, or who are the near descendants of  those who have seen, their fatherland ravaged; their homes destroyed;  their relations, friends, and neighbours slaughtered in the defence; the  tree of the national life maimed; and the full cup of the horrors of war  drained to its dregs.    To them the prospect of an invasion is not a remote contingency to be  considered and provided for at leisure after academical discussion, but  a real and instant danger from which only universal service, to which  fortunately for themselves they submit without much demur, as it could  not be enforced upon a reluctant community, can preserve them.    The possibility of invasion is the dominant anxiety of the land-frontier  nations.[11] Across the frontier they can see the conscripts drilling  who almost at a moment's notice may be marching in to attack them. Their  armies are not sent on interesting little expeditions to restrain a  too-militant tribe of hill-men or to patrol the distant marches of a  magnificent Empire, but must stand at attention generation after  generation, year after year, maintaining the featureless routine of  military life. None of the Romance of War that falls to the lot of the  British soldier--the service among strange Easterns in Asia, the  building up of a new imperial province in South Africa, the constant  change of scene along the posts which form a girdle round the world from  Hongkong to Jamaica--falls also to the lot of the continental conscript,  for whom there is only the dull waiting for the critical moment.    The land-frontier nations alone are aware of the reality of the Terror  of War; it is a Thing overshadowing and, apart from every other thing in  their world, which must not, cannot be expelled from their thoughts. The  objects that meet the eye on all sides speak of War; the railway  vehicles marked with the number of men and horses conveyable, the noble  war memorials, the officers constantly in uniform, the crowds of  soldiers in the streets, the military bearing and precision of even the  civilian servants of the State; while upon the ears falls the sound,  which is in most cases a lingering echo of the roar of war, of alien  tongues spoken within the frontier, or of the tongue of the Fatherland  spoken in exile without it.    On the other hand, Peace is believed to be permanently settled upon the  shore of the silver streak which encloses the British Isles. The war  monuments are scanty and not a few of them are grotesque; the soldier  and his work are thrust into the background, and his uniform is so often  a hindrance to him that on certain occasions he is permitted to appear  in plain clothes, that is to disguise himself as a civilian; and this  concession is officially termed a \"privilege.\" The red tunic of the  soldier, like the red rays of the spectrum which cannot be brought into  focus with the other colours, fails to make a sharp impression upon the  British retina, but projects an ill-defined image seen through a medium  of doubt and indifference.    The nation looks upon the Army much as the individual looks upon the  Policeman, as a necessary institution, but one rather to be avoided and  kept in its place when its services are not actually in requisition.  Little interest is taken in its difficulties, its merits, and its  opportunities. It is regarded not as an indispensable protection, but  rather as an expensive result of possessions in all parts of the world,  and when the peace of these is in danger of being broken, the cry too  often belated goes up: Send for the Soldiers. Probably nothing less than  an actual landing of foreign troops or the scare of it so tremendous as  to drive the nation into the opposite and equally dangerous extreme of  consternation and panic will be necessary to shake its belief, that the  white cliffs of Albion are immune to an invasion in force.    The nightmare of Militarism by which so many worthy persons are  fanatically obsessed obscures the dangers against which Militarism is an  insurance. Now Militarism is not in itself a desirable thing, and the  developments and accidents of it upon the Continent of Europe are often  not only irksome and absurd but also irreconcilable with the existence  of a healthy feeling of self-respect in the non-military sections of the  community, who are taught to regard themselves as an inferior caste; but  with all its shortcomings it promotes the moral as well as the physical  strength of a nation. It calls up some of the nobler qualities of human  nature; self-control, self-reliance, endurance, and altruism or the  devotion of Self to the good of the community; and not the least of its  merits is that it corrects and restrains the dreary materialism of the  Labour and Socialist movements.    The shy and distant bearing of the British nation and its persistent  refusal to regard the Army as part of itself, in conjunction with the  growing national passion for Sport and Athletics, fostered the idea that  War itself must be a branch of them. From time immemorial the military  had been eyed with suspicion by the country, which professed to believe  that its liberties were in greater danger from its own soldiers than  from the soldiers of a foreign power, and which for a long time withheld  from its rulers the right of having a standing army. Gradually and with  great reluctance it was convinced of the necessity of a permanent force,  not so much for home defence as for the performance of the police duties  of an Empire. As the Empire grew year by year, these duties became more  onerous and responsible, but the Army itself was not taken seriously. It  was confessedly too weak to engage in a European campaign, and the Navy  was considered to be sufficient to protect the country against invasion.    The duties of the Army abroad were generally interesting and exciting  but they did not call for the exercise of the military art with great  precision, as the opponents which it was called upon to face were rarely  experts, and there was a comfortable belief that the bravery and  endurance of the British soldier would outweigh deficiencies in other  military qualities.[12]    The War-as-a-Sport idea was also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#6)"],[1," I was so happy.    Now that I am sure you read my letters, I'll make them much more  interesting, so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around  them--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up.  I'd hate  to think that you ever read it over.    Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful.  Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don't know  what it feels like to be alone.  But I do.    Goodbye--I'll promise never to be horrid again, because now I know  you're a real person; also I'll promise never to bother you with any  more questions.    Do you still hate girls?                                   Yours for ever,                                                 Judy                                                 8th hour, Monday    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I hope you aren't the Trustee who sat on the toad?  It went off--I was  told--with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee.    Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them by the  laundry windows in the John Grier Home?  Every spring when the hoptoad  season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep them in  those window holes; and occasionally they would spill over into the  laundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days.  We were  severely punished for our activities in this direction, but in spite of  all discouragement the toads would collect.    And one day--well, I won't bore you with particulars--but somehow, one  of the fattest, biggest, JUCIEST toads got into one of those big  leather arm chairs in the Trustees' room, and that afternoon at the  Trustees' meeting--But I dare say you were there and recall the rest?    Looking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say that  punishment was merited, and--if I remember rightly--adequate.    I don't know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that spring and  the reappearance of toads always awakens the old acquisitive instinct.  The only thing that keeps me from starting a collection is the fact  that no rule exists against it.                                             After chapel, Thursday    What do you think is my favourite book?  Just now, I mean; I change  every three days.  Wuthering Heights.  Emily Bronte was quite young  when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard.  She had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man  like Heathcliffe?    I couldn't do it, and I'm quite young and never outside the John Grier  Asylum--I've had every chance in the world.  Sometimes a dreadful fear  comes over me that I'm not a genius.  Will you be awfully disappointed,  Daddy, if I don't turn out to be a great author?  In the spring when  everything is so beautiful and green and budding, I feel like turning  my back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather.  There  are such lots of adventures out in the fields!  It's much more  entertaining to live books than to write them.    Ow ! ! ! ! ! !    That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a disgusted  moment) the Senior from across the hall.  It was caused by a centipede  like this:  only worse.  Just as I had finished the last sentence and  was thinking what to say next--plump!--it fell off the ceiling and  landed at my side.  I tipped two cups off the tea table in trying to  get away.  Sallie whacked it with the back of my hair brush--which I  shall never be able to use again--and killed the front end, but the  rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped.    This dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full of  centipedes.  They are dreadful creatures.  I'd rather find a tiger  under the bed.                                                 Friday, 9.30 p.m.    Such a lot of troubles!  I didn't hear the rising bell this morning,  then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and dropped my  collar button down my neck.  I was late for breakfast and also for  first-hour recitation.  I forgot to take any blotting paper and my  fountain pen leaked.  In trigonometry the Professor and I had a  disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms.  On looking it up,  I find that she was right.  We had mutton stew and pie-plant for  lunch--hate 'em both; they taste like the asylum.  The post brought me  nothing but bills (though I must say that I never do get anything else;  my family are not the kind that write).  In English class this  afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson.  This was it:                   I asked no other thing,                 No other was denied.                 I offered Being for it;                 The mighty merchant smiled.                   Brazil?  He twirled a button                 Without a glance my way:                 But, madam, is there nothing else                 That we can show today?      That is a poem.  I don't know who wrote it or what it means.  It was  simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we were  ordered to comment upon it.  When I read the first verse I thought I  had an idea--The Mighty Merchant was a divinity who distributes  blessings in return for virtuous deeds--but when I got to the second  verse and found him twirling a button, it seemed a blasphemous  supposition, and I hastily changed my mind.  The rest of the class was  in the same predicament; and there we sat for three-quarters of an hour  with blank paper and equally blank minds.  Getting an education is an  awfully wearing process!    But this didn't end the day.  There's worse to come.    It rained so we couldn't play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead.  The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club.  I got home to  find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, and the skirt  was so tight that I couldn't sit down.  Friday is sweeping day, and the  maid had mixed all the papers on my desk.  We had tombstone for dessert  (milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla).  We were kept in chapel  twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly  women.  And then--just as I was settling down with a sigh of  well-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl named Ackerly, a  dough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl, who sits next to me  in Latin because her name begins with A (I wish Mrs. Lippett had named  me Zabriski), came to ask if Monday's lesson commenced at paragraph 69  or 70, and stayed ONE HOUR.  She has just gone.    Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events?  It isn't  the big troubles in life that require character.  Anybody can rise to a  crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage, but to meet the petty  hazards of the day with a laugh--I really think that requires SPIRIT.    It's the kind of character that I am going to develop.  I am going to  pretend that all life is just a game which I must play as skilfully and  fairly as I can.  If I lose, I am going to shrug my shoulders and  laugh--also if I win.    Anyway, I am going to be a sport.  You will never hear me complain  again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings and centipedes  drop off the wall.                                   Yours ever,                                             Judy    Answer soon.                                                             27th May    Daddy-Long-Legs, Esq.    DEAR SIR:  I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Lippett.  She hopes  that I am doing well in deportment and studies.  Since I probably have  no place to go this summer, she will let me come back to the asylum and  work for my board until college opens.    I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.    I'd rather die than go back.                       Yours most truthfully,                                             Jerusha Abbott        Cher Daddy-Jambes-Longes,    Vous etes un brick!    Je suis tres heureuse about the farm, parceque je n'ai jamais been on a  farm dans ma vie and I'd hate to retourner chez John Grier, et wash  dishes tout l'ete. There would be danger of quelque chose affreuse  happening, parceque j'ai perdue ma humilite d'autre fois et j'ai peur  that I would just break out quelque jour et smash every cup and saucer  dans la maison.    Pardon brievete et paper.  Je ne peux pas send des mes nouvelles  parceque je suis dans French class et j'ai peur que Monsieur le  Professeur is going to call on me tout de suite.    He did!                           Au revoir,                            je vous aime beaucoup.                                                     Judy                                                             30th May    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Did you ever see this campus?  (That is merely a rhetorical question.  Don't let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May.  All the shrubs  are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green--even the  old pines look fresh and new.  The grass is dotted with yellow  dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses.  Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation's coming, and with that  to look forward to, examinations don't count.    Isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in?  And oh, Daddy!  I'm the  happiest of all!  Because I'm not in the asylum any more; and I'm not  anybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I should have been,  you know, except for you).    I'm sorry now for all my past badnesses.    I'm sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett.    I'm sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins.    I'm sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.    I'm sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees' backs.    I'm going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I'm so  happy.  And this summer I'm going to write and write and write and  begin to be a great author.  Isn't that an exalted stand to take?  Oh,  I'm developing a beautiful character!  It droops a bit under cold and  frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.    That's the way with"]]]
