He had killed his string; nothing was clear in his mind save  that, and he screamed with his face hidden from his little world.    The Little Doctor, with anxious eyes and puckered eyebrows, poured  something into a teaspoon and helped Chip fight to get it down the Kid's  throat. And the Kid shrieked and struggled and strangled, as is the way  of kids the world over, and tried to spit out the stuff and couldn't, so  he screamed the louder and held his breath until he was purple, and his  parents were scared stiff. The Old Man hobbled to the door in the midst  of the uproar and asked them acrimoniously why they didn't make that  doggoned Kid stop his howling; and when Chip, his nerves already  strained to the snapping point, told him bluntly to get out and mind  his own business, he hobbled away again muttering anathemas against the  whole outfit.    The Countess rushed in from out of doors and wanted to know what under  the shinin' sun was the matter with that kid, and advised his frantic  parents to throw water in his face. Chip told her exactly what he had  told the Old Man, in exactly the same tone; so the Countess retreated,  declaring that he wouldn't be let to act that way if he was her kid, and  that he was plumb everlastingly spoiled.    The Happy Family heard the disturbance and thought the Kid was being  spanked for the accident, which put every man of them in a fighting  humor toward Chip, the Little Doctor, the Old Man and the whole world.  Pink even meditated going up to the White House to lick Chip--or  at least tell him what he thought of him--and he had plenty of  sympathizers; though they advised him half-heartedly not to buy in to  any family mixup.    It was into this storm centre that Andy Green rode headlong with his own  burden of threatened disaster.        CHAPTER 4. ANDY TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME    Andy Green was a day late in arriving at the Flying U. First he lost  time by leaving the train thirty miles short of the destination marked  on his ticket, and when he did resume his journey on the next train, he  traveled eighty-four miles beyond Dry Lake, which landed him in Great  Falls in the early morning. There, with the caution of a criminal  carefully avoiding a meeting with Miss Hallman, he spent an hour in  poring over a plat of a certain section of Chouteau County, and in  copying certain description of unoccupied land.    He had not slept very well the night before and he looked it. He had  cogitated upon the subject of land speculations and the welfare of his  outfit until his head was one great, dull ache; but he stuck to his  determination to do something to block the game of the Homeseekers'  Syndicate. Just what that something would be he had not yet decided. But  on general principles it seemed wise to learn all he could concerning  the particular tract of land about which Florence Grace Hallman had  talked.    The day was past when range rights might be defended honorably with  rifles and six-shooters and iron nerved men to use them--and I fear  that Andy Green sighed because it was so. Give him the \"bunch\" and free  swing, and he thought the Homeseekers would lose their enthusiasm before  even the first hot wind blew up from the southwest to wither their  crops. But such measures were not to be thought of; if they fought at  all they must fight with the law behind them--and even Andy's optimism  did not see much hope from the law; none, in fact, since both the law  and the moneyed powers were eager for the coming of homebuilders into  that wide land. All up along the Marias they had built their board  shacks, and back over the benches as far as one could see. There was  nothing to stop them, everything to make their coming easy.    Andy scowled at the plat he was studying, and admitted to himself that  it looked as though the Home Seekers' Syndicate were going to have  things their own way; unless--There he stuck. There must be some  way out; never in his life had he faced a situation which had been  absolutely hopeless; always there had been some chance to win, if a man  only saw it in time and took it. In this case it was the clerk in the  office who pointed the way with an idle remark.    \"Going to take up a claim, are you?\"    Andy looked up at him with the blank stare of preoccupation, and changed  expression as the question filtered into his brain and fitted somehow  into the puzzle. He grinned, said maybe he would, folded the sheet of  paper filled with what looked like a meaningless jumble of letters  and figures, bought a plat of that township and begged some government  pamphlets, and went out humming a little tune just above a whisper. At  the door he tilted his hat down at an angle over his right eye and took  long, eager steps toward an obscure hotel and his meagre baggage.    There was no train going east until midnight, and he caught that train.  This time he actually got off at Dry Lake, ate a hurried breakfast, got  his horse out of the livery stable and dug up the dust of the lane with  rapid hoof-beats so that he rode all the way to the first hill followed  by a rolling, gray cloud that never quite caught him.    When he rode down the Hog's Back he saw the Happy Family bunched around  some object on the creek-bank, and he heard the hysterical screaming of  the Kid up in the house, and saw the Old Man limping excitedly up and  down the porch. A man less astute than Andy Green would have known that  some thing had happened. He hurried down the last slope, galloped along  the creek-bottom, crossed the ford in a couple of leaps and pulled up  beside the group that surrounded Silver.    \"What's been taking place here?\" he demanded curiously, skipping the  usual greetings.    \"Hell,\" said the Native Son succinctly, glancing up at him.    \"Old Silver looked over the fence into Kingdom Come,\" Weary enlarged the  statement a little. \"Tried to take a drink with a nose bag on. I guess  he'll come through all right.\"    \"What ails the Kid?\" Andy demanded, glancing toward the house whence  issued a fresh outburst of shrieks.    The Happy Family looked at one another and then at the White House.    \"Aw, some folks hain't got a lick of sense when it comes to kids,\" Big  Medicine accused gruffly.    \"The Kid,\" Weary explained, \"put the nose bag on Silver and then left  the stable door open.\"    \"They ain't--spanking him for it, are they?\" Andy demanded  belligerently. \"By gracious, how'd a kid know any better? Little bit of  a tad like that--\"    \"Aw, they don't never spank the Kid!\" Slim defended the parents loyally.  \"By golly, they's been times when I would-a spanked him, if it'd been  me. Countess says it's plumb ridiculous the way that Kid runs over  'em--rough shod. If he's gittin' spanked now, it's the first time.\"    \"Well,\" said Andy, looking from one to another and reverting to his own  worry as he swung down from his sweating horse, \"there's something worse  than a spanked kid going to happen to this outfit if you fellows don't  get busy and do something. There's a swarm of dry-farmers coming in  on us, with their stock to eat up the grass and their darned fences  shutting off the water--\"    \"Oh, for the Lord's sake, cut it out!\" snapped Pink. \"We ain't in the  mood for any of your joshes. We've had about enough excitement for  once.\"    \"Ah, don't be a damn' fool,\" Andy snapped back. \"There's no josh about  it. I've got the whole scheme, just as they framed it up in Minneapolis.  I got to talking with a she-agent on the train, and she gave the whole  snap away; wanted me to go in with her and help land the suckers. I laid  low, and made a sneak to the land office and got a plat of the land, and  all the dope--\"    \"Get any mail?\" Pink interrupted him, in the tone that took no notice  whatever of Andy's ill news.    \"Time I was hearing from them spurs I sent for.\" Andy silently went  through his pockets and produced what mail he had gleaned from the  post-office, and led his horse into the shade of the stable and pulled  off the saddle. Every movement betrayed the fact that he was in the  grip of unpleasant emotions, but to the Happy Family he said not another  word.    The Happy Family did not notice his silence at the time. But afterwards,  when the Kid had stopped crying and Silver had gotten to his feet and  wobbled back to the stable, led by Chip, who explained briefly and  satisfactorily the cause of the uproar at the house, and the boys had  started up to their belated dinner, they began to realize that for a  returned traveler Andy Green was not having much to say.    They asked him about his trip, and received brief answers. Had he been  anyone else they would have wanted to know immediately what was eatin'  on him; but since it was Andy Green who sat frowning at his toes and  smoking his cigarette as though it had no comfort or flavor, the boldest  of them were cautious. For Andy Green, being a young man of vivid  imagination and no conscience whatever, had fooled them too often with  his lies. They waited, and they watched him covertly and a bit puzzled.    Silence and gloom were not boon companions of Andy Green, at any time.  So Weary, having the most charitable nature of any among them, sighed  and yielded the point of silent contention.    \"What was all that you started to tell us about the dry-farmers, Andy?\"  he asked indulgently.    \"All straight goods. But there's no use talking to you bone-heads.  You'll set around chewing the rag and looking wise till it's too late to  do anything but holler your heads off.\" He got up from where he had been  lounging on a bench just outside the mess house and walked away,  with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and his shoulders drooped  forward.    The Happy Family looked after him doubtfully.    \"Aw, it's just some darned josh uh his,\" Happy Jack declared. \"I know  HIM.\"    \"Look at the way "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#6)"],[1,"be argued that the  fact of removal in the Maryborough tribes is any very strong evidence of  the primitive nature of the custom. In the other tribes, on the other  hand, it is distinctly stated that the practice prevails only when  marriage takes place between members of two different tribes, and among  the Wakelbura only exceptionally even when the wife is of an alien folk.  Whatever else the custom proves in these cases, it certainly evidences  the existence of friendly relations between the tribes in question; for  if it were otherwise the man would hardly be disposed to give up the  security of his own people for the perils of a strange community; on the  other hand it is hardly likely that the man's tribe would allow him to  pass over to the ranks of the strangers, nor would they view with  equanimity the loss of effective fighting strength which would result  from the fact that his children too would be numbered against them, not  for them, if it came to hostilities. The custom is therefore clear  evidence of fairly permanent friendly relations in the district in  question; and it is plain that we cannot assume these to have existed in  more primitive times. It is therefore difficult to see in what way the  present day practices lend support to the theory that the original usage  was for the husband to remove to his wife's group. For, be it noted,  there is not a single case, unless we include the anomalous Kurnai, in  which the husband removes to his wife's group within his own tribe; but  clearly this is the custom to which the removal theory applies. So far,  therefore, as Australia is concerned, the removal theory falls to the  ground; it cannot of course be disproved, but we are not justified in  assuming that matrilineal descent and matria potestas are due to a  custom of removal.    Inasmuch as patrilocal[15] marriage involves descent of group and tribal  property rights in the male line, it might appear that in rejecting the  hypothesis of a prior stage of matrilocal marriage, we are involving  ourselves in difficulties; for it is clearly not easy to see how descent  could come to be reckoned through the mother, while property descended  through the father. But it is obviously unnecessary in the first place  to regard the individual rights of property as originating  simultaneously or under the same conditions as the rules as to kinship  or even communal property; there is nothing to show how long the present  system of land tenure in Australia has held good, and it is clearly one  which points to a certain growth of population; for if the local group  were remote from their neighbours, there would be little need to  encroach; moreover, the exact delimitation of territory now in practice  is a thing of long growth.    Further consideration however shows that it is only by a confusion of  thought that we can speak of land descending in the male line (that is,  of course, in respect of group rights, not private property, to which we  return later); strictly speaking the descent of landed property is  neither in the male nor the female line but local. A man who removes to  his wife's tribe is, so far as we can see, as truly part owner of the  tribal land as if he were himself a member of the tribe by birth within  its limits. The suggested difficulty, therefore, does not exist, and the  conclusion as to removal customs holds good.    We may now examine the relation of matriliny to the seat of authority in  the family. Questions of potestas naturally range themselves under more  than one head. We have (1) the relation of the husband (_a_) to the wife  and (_b_) to the children; (2) the relation of the mother to the  children, and closely connected with this the influence of the mother's  brother; finally (3) we have the position of the widow, a matter indeed  more intimately connected with inheritance from a legal point of view  but in Australia more closely connected with potestas than in countries  where slavery is a recognised institution.    Small as is our information on Australian jurisprudence, it is certain  that the husband enjoys practically unrestricted rights over the person  of his wife, _pirrauru_ and similar customs apart. He may at will lend  her or hire her out to strangers; he may punish her infidelity,  disobedience or awkwardness by chastisement, not stopping short of the  infliction of spear or club wounds; he may even, according to Roth[16],  go so far as to kill her and yet get off scot free, his only duty in  such a case being to provide a sister for the brothers of his dead wife  to kill in retaliation.    This custom suggests that the kin to which the woman belongs claim a  certain property in her even after she is married, and this partial  proprietorship naturally implies a slight protecting influence; for it  would clearly not be in every case easy for the homicidal male to find a  sister ready to go out and be killed as a set-off to his murdered wife.  We should not, it is true, overlook the fact that the customs of the  Pitta-Pitta differ from those of many of the Australian tribes, in that  exchange of sisters is not practised. Otherwise it would be tempting to  argue that this proprietorship in the women of their kin may go back to  the time of Mr Lang's connubial groups and help to explain the reckoning  of descent through females. For clearly, if a woman still belongs in a  sense to the group she has left, so may her children belong to the same  group, inasmuch as their relationship to her is, to us at any rate,  unmistakeable. If any evidence could be produced for the widespread  existence of the custom (found in various parts of the globe, though  not, up to the present, in Australia), according to which the widow and  her children remove to her own district, some probability would be  imparted to this hypothesis.    The ordinary rule as regards punishment inflicted by the husband on the  wife seems to be that he may go any length short of doing her a mortal  injury, without being liable to be called to account. The punishment of  death however may only be inflicted for adultery and certain specified  offences without incurring a blood-feud with the woman's relatives.    It is by no means improbable that under the influence of the custom of  exchanging sisters there may be a tendency for the control of the kin in  this respect to diminish; in fact the Boulia example is only explicable  on this hypothesis. At the same time we cannot overlook the fact that  elopement, or real marriage by capture, as distinguished from formal  abduction, would, so far as we can see, have a similar effect, and the  rise of the custom of exchange of sisters would in that case tend to  re-establish rather than weaken the power of the woman's kin, at any  rate in the first instance.    However this may be, the woman's kin exercises, _prima facie_, some kind  of protectorship. At the present day the kinship may be matrilineal or  patrilineal without affecting their right. But if, before kinship was  reckoned at all, this protectorship were exercised for the benefit of  the children, we clearly have a possible cause of matriliny.    For a discussion of the question of the inheritance of the deceased's  wife by his brother we have more facts at our disposal. As a matter of  fact it is a not infrequent custom in Australia for the widow to pass to  the deceased husband's brother[17]; or if she does not become his wife,  he decides to whom she shall be allotted[18]. In no case do the woman's  kin seem to have a voice in the selection of her new husband. On the  whole therefore the proprietary rights found in the Boulia district seem  to be the product of exceptional local conditions. If this is so, it is  clear that in the matter of potestas the rights of the woman's kin are  now absolutely restricted to protecting her from a death which she has  not according to native law deserved and to avenging such a death when  it is inflicted by the husband.    The so-called levirate, or right of succession to the widow, is clearly  of much importance, so far as questions of dominion are concerned; but  as regards the problems of descent the evidence is less easily  interpreted. It has sometimes been assumed that the succession of the  brother and not the son is a mark of matriliny; but it is clear that  where the right of appropriating the widow is concerned, this is very  far from being the case, for the simple reason that the real matria  potestas would put her at the disposal of the kin from whom she  originally came; on the other hand, inasmuch as the son is naturally  debarred from marrying his own mother or his tribal mother, who commonly  belongs to a class into which he does not marry, there might easily  arise in a purely patripotestal and patrilineal tribe a custom of  handing over the widow to the father's brother.    On the whole however it seems simplest to regard the matter as one in  which the rights are determined by no considerations of inheritance or  descent but simply by the rule that the property in the woman remains  vested in the body of purchasers. For it must be remembered that not  only an own but also a tribal sister may be given in exchange for a  wife. From this it follows that, theoretically at any rate, the  contracting parties are corporations rather than individuals, and in  this case the death of the individual on whose behalf the transaction  has been effected does not extinguish the proprietary rights acquired by  handing over a woman, standing in the relation of sister to the one  corporation, in exchange for another woman standing in the relation of  sister to the other corporation.    If this solution is correct, it is unnecessary to go into the  complicated question of the relation of brother-inheritance to matriliny  and patriliny. For it is by no means clear that it is an exemplification  of the former rather than the latter principle. It may, of"]]]
