The crenelated, black border of the  Chicchan-spot in Fig. 38 passes in rapid cursive drawing almost of itself  into the scallops of Fig. 37, a transition to which there are distinct  tendencies on the serpent's body in Tro. 27a. Nor does the fact, that  under H's hieroglyph different personages are very often pictured, whom  we cannot positively identify, compel the assumption that we have here  not _one_, but two or more mythical figures, for the same is true of  other hieroglyphs of gods. There are many places in the manuscripts where  the text contains a definite well-known hieroglyph of a god, while the  accompanying picture represents some other deity or some other figure not  definitely characterized, perhaps merely a human form (priest, warrior,  woman and the like). Thus in Dr. 4a we see H's hieroglyph in the text,  but the picture is the figure of god P while in other places we miss the  characteristic Chicchan-spot on the figure represented, for example Dr.  4c, 6a, 7b, 7c, 14a, 21c. In the Madrid manuscript, it is true, H's  hieroglyph also occurs often enough, but _not in a single instance_ is a  deity represented displaying the Chicchan-spot. This fact is, I think, to  be explained by the coarser style of the drawing, which does not admit of  representing such fine details as in the Dresden manuscript. In the Paris  manuscript H's hieroglyph occurs but once (p. 8, bottom).    Seler thinks he recognizes in some of the figures represented under H's  hieroglyph in the manuscripts, a so-called \"young god\". Such a deity is  unknown and the assumption is entirely arbitrary. Apparently this \"young  god\" is an invention of Brinton. The purely inductive and descriptive  study of the manuscripts does not prove the existence of such a  personage, and we must decline to admit him as the result of deductive  reasoning. In this so-called \"young god\", we miss, first of all, a  characteristic mark, a distinct peculiarity such as belongs to all the  figures of gods in the manuscripts without exception and by which he  could be recognized. Except his so-called youthfulness, however, no such  definite marks are to be found. Furthermore there is no figure of a god  in the manuscripts which would not be designated by a definite  characteristic hieroglyph. No such hieroglyph can be proved as belonging  to the \"young god\". The figures, which are supposed to have a \"youthful  appearance\" in the Madrid manuscript, often convey this impression merely  in consequence of their smallness and of the pitiful, squatting attitude  in which they are represented. Furthermore real _children_ do occur here  and there, thus, for example, in the Dresden manuscript in connection  with the pictures of women in the first part and in Tro. 20*c in the  representation of the so-called \"infant baptism.\"    That god H has some relation to the serpent must be conjectured from what  has been said. Thus, for example, on Dr. 15b, we see his hieroglyph  belonging to the figure of a woman with the knotted serpent on her head,  in Dr. 4a to the god P, who there bears a serpent in his hand, and in  Dr. 35b in connection with a serpent with B's head. What this relation  is, cannot now be stated.    The day dedicated to god H is Chicchan, and the sign for this day is his  distinguishing hieroglyph.      I. The Water-Goddess.    [Illustration: Fig. 41]    In the Dresden manuscript the figure of an old woman, with the body  stained brown and claws in place of feet, occurs repeatedly. She wears on  her head a knotted serpent and with her hands pours water from a vessel.  Evidently we have here a personification of water in its quality of  destroyer, a goddess of floods and cloud-bursts, which, as we know, play  an important part in Central America. Page 27, of the Codex Troano  contains a picture, in which this character of goddess I may be  distinctly recognized. In accordance with this character, also on Dr. 74,  where something resembling a flood is represented, she wears the  cross-bones of the death-god.    The goddess is pictured in the manner described in the following places:  Dr. 39b, 43b, 67a and 74. The figure corresponding to her in the  Madrid manuscript, in Tro. 27 and 34*c, displays some variations, in  particular the tiger claws on the feet and the red-brown color of the  body are lacking. But the agreement cannot be questioned, I think, when  we recall that the Maya manuscripts doubtless originated in different  ages and different areas of civilization, circumstances which readily  explain such variations. The goddess distinguished in the Madrid  manuscript by symbols of flood and water is doubtless the same as goddess  I of the Dresden manuscript described above; her unmistakable character  of water-goddess in both manuscripts is in favor of this. In both  manuscripts she is invariably distinguished by the serpent on her head,  which, as we know, is a symbol of the water flowing along and forming  waves.    Strange to say, a fixed hieroglyph of this goddess cannot be proved with  certainty. There is some probability in favor of the sign given in Fig.  41. The well-known oblong signs, which Foerstemann (Drei Mayahieroglyphen,  published in the Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie, 1901, pp. 215-221) interprets  as the sign for evil days, frequently occur with her. This would be  appropriate for the goddess of floods.    In the Dresden manuscript a few similar figures of women are found, who,  like goddess I, wear a knotted serpent on the head. Representations of  this kind occur in Dr. 9c, 15b, 18a, 20a, 22b and 23b. Whether they  are identical with goddess I is doubtful, since there is no symbolic  reference to water in these passages. Besides, the hieroglyphs of other  known deities occur each time in the above-mentioned places, so that  definite mythologic relations must be assumed to exist here between the  women repsented and the deities in question. Thus in Dr. 9c we find D's  sign, in 15b that of H; on 18a, 22b and 23b we see only the general  sign for a woman. In Dr. 20a the signs are effaced.    In the Codex Troano goddess I occurs on pp. 25b and 27; there is also a  woman with the knotted serpent on her head in Tro. 34*c. In the Codex  Cortesianus and in the Paris manuscript these forms are wholly lacking.      K. The God with the Ornamented Nose.    [Illustration: Figs. 42-43]    This god, as already mentioned in connection with B, is not identical  with the latter, but is probably closely related to him. His hieroglyph  is Fig. 42; Fig. 43 is the form in the Madrid manuscript. He is closely  related to god B. He is represented in Dr. 25 (centre) where he is  perhaps conceived of as a priest wearing a mask with the face of the god,  also in Dr. 7a, 12a (with his own hieroglyph and that of E!), 26  (bottom) with a variant of the sign. His figure without the hieroglyph  occurs in Dr. 3. Very frequently the well-known group, 3 Oc, is given  with him and in connection with his hieroglyph (in Dr. 3, 7a, 10b  (right); without picture, 12a). Foerstemann (Drei Mayahieroglyphen,  Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie, 1901. pp 215-221) sees in this the sign for  good days, a proof that we have to do here with a benevolent deity well  disposed to mankind, his kinship with B being also in favor of this  interpretation. His hieroglyph alone without his picture occurs in Dr.  10b, 49 (middle and bottom), 58 (bottom, left), and Tro. 8*b; with a  variant of the attribute in Dr. 24 (third vertical row). A slight  variation appears also in Dr. 69 (top, right).    In Dr. 65a (middle) B is pictured. But in the text we see K's hieroglyph  presented by a hand. The next figure on the same page at the right  represents god B with the head of K on his own and the same head once  more in his hand. Agreeing with this, we find in the accompanying text  the signs of B and K, the latter in a hand. K seems to be pictured again  in Dr. 46 (bottom); the passage, however, is somewhat obliterated. The  hieroglyph is lacking in this place; it is found, however, on the  preceding page 45 (middle).    In addition to the passage already mentioned, which represents god K  together with B, such double deities again occur in the Paris manuscript,  p. 13, where B holds K's head in his hand; in Dr. 34b, where he carries  this head on his own and in Dr. 67a where he appears to carry it in a  rope. Once, how ever, a variation of these plainly synonymous  representations occurs, namely in Dr. 49 (at the top), where we see a  _feminine_ form above whose head rises the head of god K. In the Paris  manuscript, so far as its defaced condition permits us to recognize the  representation, K occurs very frequently, as for example, in Per. 3, 4, 5,  6, 7 and 9 (in part only his head is given, presented by god B, as in the  Dresden manuscript).    Brinton considers this figure simply as a special manifestation of B and  identical with that god. Foerstemann thinks that god K is a storm-deity,  whose ornamental nose, according to the conventional mode of drawing of  the Central American peoples, is intended to represent the blast of the  storm.    Apparently, however, the deity has an _astronomic significance_ and seems  to symbolize a _star_. In favor of this is the fact, that on the  so-called initial pages of the Madrid manuscript (Cort. 22-Tro. 36) a  row, composed of repetitions of his sign, occurs below the signs of the  cardinal points and parallel to a row composed of signs of god C, the  god of the polar star and the north. The hieroglyphs of C and K are the  only hieroglyphs of gods, which are repeated 13 times on these pages with  the 13 days enumerated there. The two gods must, therefore, have either a  parallel or an opposite astronomic and calendric meaning. The fact that  in Dr. 25 and 26 K appears as regent of the year, is an argument in favor  of his astronomic significance.    According to Foerstemann, Muluc is the day dedicated to god K.

Any who liked might do preparation in their own  form room, and many availed themselves of the permission, especially  those who came from a distance, and stayed for dinner at the school.  When Winona first examined her time-table she had not considered its  demands excessively formidable, but before she had been a week at Seaton  she began to realize that she would have very few spare moments to call  her own. Miss Bishop believed in girls being fully occupied, and in  addition to the ordinary form work, expected every one to take part in  the games, and in the numerous societies and guilds which had been  instituted. Winona found that she was required to join the Debating  Club, and the Patriotic Knitting Guild, while a Dramatic Society and a  Literary Association would be prepared to open their doors to her if she  proved worthy of admission. So far, however, she considered that she had  enough on her hands. The demands of her new life were almost  overwhelming, and she lived from day to day in a whirl of fresh  experiences. It took her some time even to grasp the names of the  seventeen other girls in her form. Audrey Redfern, her left-hand  neighbor, was friendly, but Olave Parry, at the desk in front, ignored  her very existence. She gathered that Audrey, like herself, was a  new-comer, while Olave had attended the school since its foundation; but  she did not realize the significance of this in the difference of their  behavior to her. The fact was that the three new girls in the form were  on probation. The others, who had come up from the Lower School, and  were well versed in the traditions of the place, were not willing to  admit them too quickly into favor. They talked them over in private.    \"Audrey Redfern seems a decent enough little soul,\" said Estelle  Harrison. \"There's really nothing offensive about her, to my mind.  Garnet Emerson I rather like. I fancy she could be jolly. I'm going to  speak to her in a day or two, but not too soon.\"    \"What do you think of Winona Woodward?\" queried Bessie Kirk.    \"Much too big an opinion of herself. Began bragging about her  scholarship first thing. She needs sitting upon, to my mind.\"    \"She's pretty!\"    \"Yes, and she knows it, too!\"    \"Well, she can't help knowing it. I call her most striking looking. Her  eyes are lovely, though I never can make out whether they're dark gray  or hazel under those long lashes. Her hair's just the color of bronze,  and such a lot of it! It beats Joyce Newton's hollow; besides, Joyce has  absolutely white eyelashes.\"    \"Like a pig's!\" laughed Hilda Langley. \"I agree with you that Winona's  pretty, but I don't think she'll ever be a chum of mine, all the same.\"    The result of the stand-off attitude on the part of the rest of the form  was the cementing of a close friendship between Winona and Garnet. It  seemed natural for the holders of the two County Scholarships to become  chums, also they found each other's society congenial. It marked a new  epoch for Winona. She had had few friends of her own age. She had been  the eldest pupil at Miss Harmon's small school, and her sisters were so  much younger than herself that their interests were on a different plane  to her own. Garnet, with her merry brown eyes, eager and enthusiastic  nature, and amusing tongue, seemed a revelation.    The two girls spent every available moment together, and soon waxed  confidential on the subject of their home affairs.    \"We're all named after precious stones,\" said Garnet. \"Pearl, my eldest  sister, is classics mistress at a school; Jacinthe is studying for a  health visitor, Ruby is at a Horticultural College, and Beryl is  secretary at a Settlement. Aren't there a lot of us? All girls too, and  not a single brother. I'm the baby of the family! I'd like to go to  Holloway, if I can get a scholarship, but that remains to be seen.  Meanwhile two years at the High's not so bad, is it? I expect I'm going  to enjoy it. Aren't you?\"    \"Yes--perhaps. If the rest of the form were nicer, I might.\"    \"Oh, they'll come round! We can't expect them to take us to their bosoms  straight off! We're goods on approval.\"    \"We've as much right here as they have!\" grunted Winona.    \"But they were here first, and of course that always counts for  something. We shall have to show that we're worth our salt before we get  any footing in the form. The question is how best to do it.\"    Winona shook her head. It was beyond her comprehension.    \"I had a few tips from Jacinthe,\" ruminated Garnet. \"She was Captain the  last year she was at school, so she ought to know. You see, we've to  steer between Scylla and Charybdis. We mustn't push ourselves forward  too violently, or they'll call us cheeky, but on the other hand, if  we're content to take a back seat, we may stay there for the rest of the  term. Comprenez vous? It's a matter of seizing one's chance. I've an  idea floating about in my mind. Do you happen to be anything extra  special at singing, or reciting, or acting?\"    \"I haven't had much practice at acting, but I can play the guitar.  Mummie taught me. She lived in Spain for three years when she was a  girl, and learnt there.\"    \"The very thing! How perfectly splendid! I play the mandoline myself,  and the two go so well together. Did you bring your guitar with you?\"    \"No. I didn't think I should have any time for it.\"    \"But you could write for it, couldn't you?\"    \"Oh, yes! Mummie would send it to me.\"    \"Well, this is my idea. You know next week there's to be a big general  meeting of the whole school to choose a Games Captain. So far the games  department here is rather in its infancy. I've been making enquiries,  and there isn't such a thing as a form trophy. There certainly ought to  be, to spur on enthusiasm. I'm going to pluck up my courage, tackle one  or two members of the Sixth, and suggest that after the meeting we hold  a sing-song, and take a collection to provide a form trophy. I don't  believe anybody's ever thought of it.\"    \"Ripping! But what exactly is a sing-song?\"    \"Oh, just an informal concert. I thought if you and I played the  mandoline and guitar together, it would make a good item. I see two of  the prefects coming along over there, I believe I'll go and ask them.\"    \"I admire your courage!\"    Garnet returned in a few minutes, tolerably well satisfied with her  mission.    \"I believe the idea will catch on,\" she announced. \"Of course I couldn't  expect them to say 'yes' immediately. They were very cautious, and said  they would put it to the form. I've sown the seed at any rate, and we  must wait for developments.\"    Apparently Garnet's proposition proved acceptable to the Sixth, for the  very next day a notice was pinned on the board in the hall:            \"There will be a General Meeting of the School on Tuesday,          October 4th, at 3 p.m., for the purpose of electing a Games          Captain.            \"The meeting will be followed by a Symposium, when a collection          will be taken, the proceeds of which will be devoted to the          purchase of a form trophy.            \"Performers kindly submit their names without delay to M.          HOWELL, as the program is being made up.\"    Garnet was one of the first to read the notice, and she started off at  once to the Sixth Form room. She sought out Winona on her return.    \"So my little scheme's come off!\" she beamed. \"You bet the Sixth will  take all the credit for evolving it, but I don't care! I've put our  names down for a mandoline and guitar duet, and said we'd be ready to  help with any accompaniments they like. Meg Howell just jumped at that.  It seems Patricia Marshall and Clarice Nixon are going to sing a Christy  Minstrel song, and she thought our instruments would add to the effect  no end. I tell you we shall score. Did you write for your guitar?\"    \"Yes, I expect it will be sent off to-day.\"    \"Then we must begin and practice. I've got a topping duet that's quite  easy. Can you come home with me after school to-morrow for half an hour  or so? I know my cousins will be glad to see you. Then we might try over  one or two things, and see how they go.\"    \"It will be all right if I tell Aunt Harriet I shall be late,\" agreed  Winona.    The instrument arrived the same evening, so she was able to keep her  promise to Garnet next day. Fortunately they had only one class that  afternoon, and were able to leave school at half-past three. Garnet's  cousins lived within a short tramcar ride. They were musical people, and  sympathized with her project. Garnet led Winona into the drawing-room,  and began without waste of time.    \"Let me look at your guitar! Oh, what a beauty! What's the label inside?  Juan Da Costa, Seville! Then it must be Spanish. I suppose they're the  best. My mandoline's Italian; it was made in Milan. We must tune them  together, mustn't we? Can you read well? This is the book of duets. I  thought this Barcarolle would be easy, it has such a lovely swing about  it. Here's the guitar part.\"          CHAPTER IV    The Symposium      By the aid of diligent practicing in private, and several rehearsals at  Garnet's house, the girls at last got their duet to run smoothly. Garnet  was frankly pleased.    \"The two instruments go so nicely together! A mandoline's ever so much  better played with a guitar accompaniment than with the piano. I say,  suppose we were to get an encore!\"    \"I don't suppose anything of the sort.\"    \"Don't be too modest. It's as well to be prepared.\"    \"I'm not going to practice anything more, so I warn you.\"    \"Well, take something you know, from your own book. This song. I could  play the air very softly on the mandoline, and we'd both sing it. That  won't give you any extra trouble.\"    \"It isn't the trouble so much as the state of my fingers."]]]
