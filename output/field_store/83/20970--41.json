Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was  beginning to grow larger again.    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went  down on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" he began.    \"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.    \"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.    \"Call the next witness!\" said the King.    The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in  her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once.    \"Give your evidence,\" said the King.    \"Sha'n't,\" said the cook.    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,  \"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\"    \"Well, if I must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\"    \"Pepper, mostly,\" said the cook.    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they  had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.    \"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\"    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her  surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the  name \"Alice!\"          X--ALICE'S EVIDENCE      \"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over  the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd  below.    \"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay.    \"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are  back in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis,  looking hard at Alice.    \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.    \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.    The King then read from his book: \"Rule forty-two. _All persons more  than a mile high to leave the court_.\"    \"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.    \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the Queen.    [Illustration]    \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice.    The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your  verdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.    \"There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty,\" said the White  Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This paper has just been picked  up. It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\" He  unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It isn't a letter, after all;  it's a set of verses.\"    \"Please, Your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they  can't prove that I did; there's no name signed at the end.\"    \"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your  name like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a general clapping of  hands at this.    \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the White Rabbit.    There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the  verses.    \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\" said the  King.    \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,\" ventured Alice.    \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of  trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the jury consider  their verdict.\"    \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\"    \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the  sentence first!\"    \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.    \"I won't!\" said Alice.    \"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody  moved.    \"Who cares for _you_?\" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by  this time). \"You're nothing but a pack of cards!\"    [Illustration]    At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon  her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and  tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her  head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead  leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.    \"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've  had!\"    \"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her  sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures  of hers that you have just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off,  thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had  been.

William II (son of Frederick III and Princess Victoria of England),   born Jan. 27, 1859, succeeded Frederick III in 1888.    These incidents, names, and dates are mere whisps of history. It is  only necessary to indicate that to articulate this skeleton of  history, clothe it with flesh, and give it its appropriate arms and  costumes would entail the putting of all mediaeval European history  upon a screen, to deliver oneself without apology from any such task.  It may be for this reason that there is no history of Germany in the  English tongue, that ranks above the elementary and the mediocre.  There is a masterly and scholarly history of the Holy Roman Empire by  an Englishman, which no student of Germany may neglect, but he who  would trace the beginnings of Germany from 113 B. C. down to the time  of the Great Elector, 1640, must be his own guide through the  trackless deserts, of the formation into separate nations, of modern  Europe. It is even with misgivings that the student picks his way from  the time of the Great Elector to Bismarck, and to modern Germany.    The Peace of Westphalia, 1648, marks the end of the Thirty Years' War,  and finds Germany with a population reduced from sixteen millions to  four millions. Famine which drove men and women to cannibalism, bands  of them being caught cooking human bodies in a caldron for food;  slaughter that drove men to make laws authorizing every man to have  two wives, and punishing men and women who became monks and nuns;  lawlessness that bred roving bands of murderers, who killed, robbed,  and even ate their victims, demanded a ruler of no little vigor to  lead his people back to civic, moral, and material health. The Great  Elector wrested east Prussia from Poland, he defeated and drove off  the Swedes, whom Louis XIV had drawn into an alliance against him, he  travelled from end to end of his country, seeking out the problems of  distress and remedying them by inducing immigration from Holland,  Switzerland, and the north, by building roads, bridges, schools, and  churches, and by encouraging planting, trade, and commerce. He built  the Frederick William Canal connecting the Oder and the Spree, and  introduced the potato to his countrymen. Germany now produces in  normal years fifteen hundred million bushels of potatoes. The splendid  equestrian statue of the Great Elector on the long bridge at Berlin,  is a worthy monument to the first great Hohenzollern.    When Charles II of Spain died, Louis XIV, the Emperor Leopold I of the  Holy Roman Empire, and the Elector of Bavaria, all three claimed the  right to name his successor. In the war that followed and which lasted  a dozen years, the Emperor, Holland, England, Portugal, the Elector of  Hanover, and the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg, the son of the  Great Elector, were allied against France. Frederick, the Elector of  Brandenburg, was permitted by the Emperor, in return for his services  at this time, to assume the title of King, and he crowned himself and  his wife Sophia Elizabeth, at Koenigsberg, King and Queen of Prussia,  taking the title of Frederick I of Prussia, January 18th, 1701.    This novus homo among sovereigns was now a fellow king with the rulers  of England, France, Denmark, and Sweden, and the only crowned head in  the empire, except the Emperor himself, and the Elector of Saxony, who  had been chosen King of Poland in 1697. By persistent sycophancy he  had pushed his way into the inner circle of the crowned. Those who  have picked social locks these latter days by similar sycophancies, by  losses at bridge in the proper quarter, by suffering sly familiarities  to their women folk, and by wearing their personal and family dignity  in sole leather, may know something of the humiliating experiences of  this new monarch. He was a feeble fellow, but his son and successor,  Frederick William I, \"a shrewd but brutal boor,\" so Lord Rosebery  calls him, and there could not be a better judge, amazed Europe by his  taste for collecting tall soldiers, by his parsimony, his kennel  manners in the treatment of his family and his subjects, and leaves a  name in history as the first, greatest, and the unique collector of  human beings on a Barnumesque scale. All known collectors of birds,  beetles, butterflies, and beasts accord him an easy supremacy, for his  aggregation of colossal grenadiers.    It is temptingly easy to be epigrammatic, perhaps witty, at the  expense of Frederick William I of Prussia. The man, however, who freed  the serfs; who readjusted the taxes; who insisted upon industry and  honesty among his officials; who proclaimed liberty of conscience and  of thought; who first put on, to wear for the rest of his life, the  uniform of his army, and thus made every officer proud to wear the  uniform himself; and who left his son an army of eighty thousand men,  thoroughly equipped and trained, and an overflowing treasury, may not  be dismissed merely with anecdotes of his eccentric brutality.    Only the ignorant and the envious, nibble at the successes of other  men, with vermin teeth and venomous tongue. Those people who can never  praise anything whole-heartedly come by their cautious censure from an  uneasy doubt of their own deserving. The contempt of Frederick William  I for learning and learned men, left him leisure for matters of far  more importance to his kingdom at the time. His habitual roughness to  his son was due, perhaps, to the fact that there was a curious strain  of effeminate culture in the man who deified Voltaire. Poor Voltaire,  who called Shakespeare \"le sauvage ivre,\" or to quote him exactly: \"On  croirait que cet ouvrage (Hamlet) est le fruit de l'imagination d'un  sauvage ivre,\" who said that Dante would never be read, and that the  comedies of Aristophanes were unworthy of presentation in a country  tavern! One is tempted to believe that the father was a man of  robuster judgment in such matters than the son, whose own rather  mediocre literary equipment, made him the easy prey of that acidulous  vestal of literature, Voltaire. However that may be, he left a useful  and unexpected legacy to his son, provided, indeed, the sinews for the  making of a powerful Prussian kingdom.    March the 31st, 1740, this eccentric miser died, to be succeeded by  his son, Frederick II, \"the Great,\" then twenty-eight years old. Here  was a surprise indeed. Of these German kings and princes in their  small dominions it has been written: \"And these magnates all aped  Louis XIV as their model. They built huge palaces, as like Versailles  as their means would permit, and generally beyond those limits, with  fountains and avenues and dismally wide paths. Even in our own day a  German monarch has left, fortunately unfinished, an accurate  Versailles on a damp island in a Bavarian lake. In those grandiose  structures they cherished a blighting etiquette, and led lives as dull  as those of the aged and torpid carp in their own stew-ponds. Then, at  the proper season, they would break away into the forest and kill  game. Moreover, still in imitation of their model, they held, as a  necessary feature in the dreary drama of their existence, ponderous  dalliances with unattractive mistresses, in whom they fondly tried to  discern the charms of a Montespan or a La Valliere. This monotonous  programme, sometimes varied by a violent contest whether they should  occupy a seat with or without a back, or with or without arms,  represented the even tenor of their lives.\"    This good stock was evidently lying fallow, and humanity is neither  dignified nor pleasant in the part of fertilizer. Frederick the Great,  it should be remembered, was a Prussian and for Prussia only. He cared  no more about a united Germany than we care for a united America to  include Canada, Mexico, and the Argentine. He cared no more for  Bavarians and Saxons than for Swedes and Frenchmen, and, as we know,  he was utterly contemptuous of German literature or the German  language. He redeemed the shallowness and the torpidity of those other  mediocre rulers by resisting, and resisting successfully, for what  must have been to him seven very long years, the whole force of  Austria and some of the lesser German powers, with the armies of  Russia and France back of them.    He had a turbulent home life; his father on one occasion even  attempted to hang him with his own hands with the cords of the window  curtains, and when he fled from home he captured him and proposed to  put him to death as a deserter, and only the intervention of the Kings  of Poland and Sweden and the Emperor of Germany prevented it. His  accomplice, however, was summarily and mercilessly put to death before  his eyes. There is no illustration in all history, of such a  successful outcome of the rod theory in education, as this of  Frederick the Great. The father put into practice what Wesley  preached: \"Break their wills betimes, whatever it costs; break the  will if you would not damn the child. Let a child from a year old be  taught to fear the rod and to cry softly.\"    The meanness and cruelty, the parsimony and the eccentricities, of the  father left the son an army of eighty thousand troops, troops as  superior to other troops in Europe as are the Japanese infantry to-day,  to the Manchu guards that pick the weeds in the court-yards of  the palace at Mukden; and he left him, too, a kingdom with no debts  and an overflowing treasury. It is seldom that such insane vanities  leave such a fair estate and an heir with such unique abilities for  its"]]]
