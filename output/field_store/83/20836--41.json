[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#6)"],[1," process of transition  from one degree of good or evil to another. The difficulties which  are urged about the origin or existence of evil are mere dialectical  puzzles, standing in the same relation to Christian philosophy as the  puzzles of the Cynics and Megarians to the philosophy of Plato. They  arise out of the tendency of the human mind to regard good and evil both  as relative and absolute; just as the riddles about motion are to be  explained by the double conception of space or matter, which the human  mind has the power of regarding either as continuous or discrete.    In speaking of divine perfection, we mean to say that God is just and  true and loving, the author of order and not of disorder, of good and  not of evil. Or rather, that he is justice, that he is truth, that he  is love, that he is order, that he is the very progress of which we were  speaking; and that wherever these qualities are present, whether in the  human soul or in the order of nature, there is God. We might still see  him everywhere, if we had not been mistakenly seeking for him apart from  us, instead of in us; away from the laws of nature, instead of in  them. And we become united to him not by mystical absorption, but by  partaking, whether consciously or unconsciously, of that truth and  justice and love which he himself is.    Thus the belief in the immortality of the soul rests at last on the  belief in God. If there is a good and wise God, then there is a progress  of mankind towards perfection; and if there is no progress of men  towards perfection, then there is no good and wise God. We cannot  suppose that the moral government of God of which we see the beginnings  in the world and in ourselves will cease when we pass out of life.    11. Considering the 'feebleness of the human faculties and the  uncertainty of the subject,' we are inclined to believe that the fewer  our words the better. At the approach of death there is not much said;  good men are too honest to go out of the world professing more than they  know. There is perhaps no important subject about which, at any time,  even religious people speak so little to one another. In the fulness  of life the thought of death is mostly awakened by the sight or  recollection of the death of others rather than by the prospect of our  own. We must also acknowledge that there are degrees of the belief in  immortality, and many forms in which it presents itself to the mind.  Some persons will say no more than that they trust in God, and that they  leave all to Him. It is a great part of true religion not to pretend  to know more than we do. Others when they quit this world are comforted  with the hope 'That they will see and know their friends in heaven.' But  it is better to leave them in the hands of God and to be assured that  'no evil shall touch them.' There are others again to whom the belief in  a divine personality has ceased to have any longer a meaning; yet they  are satisfied that the end of all is not here, but that something still  remains to us, 'and some better thing for the good than for the evil.'  They are persuaded, in spite of their theological nihilism, that the  ideas of justice and truth and holiness and love are realities. They  cherish an enthusiastic devotion to the first principles of morality.  Through these they see, or seem to see, darkly, and in a figure, that  the soul is immortal.    But besides differences of theological opinion which must ever prevail  about things unseen, the hope of immortality is weaker or stronger in  men at one time of life than at another; it even varies from day to day.  It comes and goes; the mind, like the sky, is apt to be overclouded.  Other generations of men may have sometimes lived under an 'eclipse of  faith,' to us the total disappearance of it might be compared to the  'sun falling from heaven.' And we may sometimes have to begin again and  acquire the belief for ourselves; or to win it back again when it is  lost. It is really weakest in the hour of death. For Nature, like a kind  mother or nurse, lays us to sleep without frightening us; physicians,  who are the witnesses of such scenes, say that under ordinary  circumstances there is no fear of the future. Often, as Plato tells  us, death is accompanied 'with pleasure.' (Tim.) When the end is still  uncertain, the cry of many a one has been, 'Pray, that I may be taken.'  The last thoughts even of the best men depend chiefly on the accidents  of their bodily state. Pain soon overpowers the desire of life; old age,  like the child, is laid to sleep almost in a moment. The long experience  of life will often destroy the interest which mankind have in it. So  various are the feelings with which different persons draw near to  death; and still more various the forms in which imagination clothes it.  For this alternation of feeling compare the Old Testament,--Psalm vi.;  Isaiah; Eccles.    12. When we think of God and of man in his relation to God; of the  imperfection of our present state and yet of the progress which is  observable in the history of the world and of the human mind; of the  depth and power of our moral ideas which seem to partake of the very  nature of God Himself; when we consider the contrast between the  physical laws to which we are subject and the higher law which raises us  above them and is yet a part of them; when we reflect on our capacity of  becoming the 'spectators of all time and all existence,' and of framing  in our own minds the ideal of a perfect Being; when we see how the  human mind in all the higher religions of the world, including Buddhism,  notwithstanding some aberrations, has tended towards such a belief--we  have reason to think that our destiny is different from that of animals;  and though we cannot altogether shut out the childish fear that the soul  upon leaving the body may 'vanish into thin air,' we have still, so far  as the nature of the subject admits, a hope of immortality with which we  comfort ourselves on sufficient grounds. The denial of the belief takes  the heart out of human life; it lowers men to the level of the material.  As Goethe also says, 'He is dead even in this world who has no belief in  another.'    13. It is well also that we should sometimes think of the forms of  thought under which the idea of immortality is most naturally presented  to us. It is clear that to our minds the risen soul can no longer be  described, as in a picture, by the symbol of a creature half-bird,  half-human, nor in any other form of sense. The multitude of angels, as  in Milton, singing the Almighty's praises, are a noble image, and may  furnish a theme for the poet or the painter, but they are no longer an  adequate expression of the kingdom of God which is within us. Neither is  there any mansion, in this world or another, in which the departed can  be imagined to dwell and carry on their occupations. When this earthly  tabernacle is dissolved, no other habitation or building can take them  in: it is in the language of ideas only that we speak of them.    First of all there is the thought of rest and freedom from pain; they  have gone home, as the common saying is, and the cares of this world  touch them no more. Secondly, we may imagine them as they were at  their best and brightest, humbly fulfilling their daily round of  duties--selfless, childlike, unaffected by the world; when the eye was  single and the whole body seemed to be full of light; when the mind was  clear and saw into the purposes of God. Thirdly, we may think of them  as possessed by a great love of God and man, working out His will at a  further stage in the heavenly pilgrimage. And yet we acknowledge that  these are the things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard and therefore  it hath not entered into the heart of man in any sensible manner to  conceive them. Fourthly, there may have been some moments in our own  lives when we have risen above ourselves, or been conscious of our truer  selves, in which the will of God has superseded our wills, and we have  entered into communion with Him, and been partakers for a brief season  of the Divine truth and love, in which like Christ we have been inspired  to utter the prayer, 'I in them, and thou in me, that we may be all made  perfect in one.' These precious moments, if we have ever known them, are  the nearest approach which we can make to the idea of immortality.    14. Returning now to the earlier stage of human thought which is  represented by the writings of Plato, we find that many of the  same questions have already arisen: there is the same tendency to  materialism; the same inconsistency in the application of the idea of  mind; the same doubt whether the soul is to be regarded as a cause or as  an effect; the same falling back on moral convictions. In the Phaedo the  soul is conscious of her divine nature, and the separation from the body  which has been commenced in this life is perfected in another. Beginning  in mystery, Socrates, in the intermediate part of the Dialogue, attempts  to bring the doctrine of a future life into connection with his theory  of knowledge. In proportion as he succeeds in this, the individual seems  to disappear in a more general notion of the soul; the contemplation of  ideas 'under the form of eternity' takes the place of past and future  states of existence. His language may be compared to that of some modern  philosophers, who speak of eternity, not in the sense of perpetual  duration of time, but as an ever-present quality of the soul. Yet at  the conclusion of the Dialogue, having 'arrived at the end of the  intellectual world' (Republic), he replaces the veil of mythology,  and describes the soul and her attendant genius in the language of the  mysteries or of a disciple of Zoroaster. Nor can we fairly demand of  Plato a consistency which is wanting among ourselves, who acknowledge  that another world is beyond the range of human thought, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#6)"],[1,"nsibility, before Austria made a most insolent demand upon Serbia.    The smaller nation avowed her innocence of any participation in the  murder; offered to make amends, and if it were discovered that the  conspiracy had been hatched on Serbian soil, to assist in bringing to  justice any confederates in the crime the assassin may have had.

Months should have been devoted to an  investigation.    But Germany and Austria did not want a sober investigation. They were  afraid that while it was proceeding the pretext for war might vanish. As  surmised above, they also may have feared that the responsibility for  the act would be placed in quarters that would be embarrassing to them.    On July 23, 1914, just twenty-five days after the murder, Austria  delivered her demands upon Serbia and placed a time limit of forty-eight  hours for their acceptance. With the fate of a nation and the probable  embroiling of all Europe hanging on the outcome, forty-eight hours was a  time too brief for proper consideration. Serbia could hardly summon her  statesmen in that time. Nevertheless the little country, realizing the  awful peril that impended, and that she alone would not be the sufferer,  bravely put aside all selfish considerations and practically all  considerations of national pride and honor.    The records show that every demand which Austria made on Serbia was  granted except one, which was only conditionally refused. Although this  demand involved the very sovereignty of Serbia--her existence as a  nation--the government offered to submit the matter to mediation or  arbitration. But Austria, cats-pawing for Germany, did not want her  demands accepted. The one clause was inserted purposely, because they  knew it could not be accepted. With Serbia meeting the situation  honestly and going over ninety percent of the way towards an amicable  adjustment, the diplomacy that could not obtain peace out of such a  situation, must have been imbecile or corrupt to the last degree.    An American historian discussing causes in the early stages of the war,  said:         \"The German Imperial Chancellor pays no high compliment to the       intelligence of the American people when he asks them to believe       that 'the war is a life-and-death struggle between Germany and the       Muscovite races of Russia', and was due to the royal murders at       Sarajevo.         \"To say that all Europe had to be plunged into the most       devastating war of human history because an Austrian subject       murdered the heir to the Austrian throne on Austrian soil in a       conspiracy in which Serbians were implicated, is too absurd to be       treated seriously. Great wars do not follow from such causes,       although any pretext, however trivial, may be regarded as       sufficient when war is deliberately sought.         \"Nor is the Imperial Chancellor's declaration that 'the war is a       life-and-death struggle between Germany and the Muscovite races of       Russia' convincing in the slightest degree. So far as the Russian       menace to Germany is concerned, the Staats-Zeitung is much nearer       the truth when its editor, Mr. Ridder, boasts that 'no Russian army       ever waged a successful war against a first-class power.'         \"The life-and-death struggle between Germany and the Muscovite       races of Russia is a diplomatic fiction invented after German       Autocracy, taking advantage of the Serbian incident, set forth to       destroy France. It was through no fear of Russia that Germany       violated her solemn treaty obligations by invading the neutrality       of Belgium and Luxemburg. It was through no fear of Russia that       Germany had massed most of her army near the frontiers of France,       leaving only six army corps to hold Russia in check. Germany's       policy as it stands revealed by her military operations was to       crush France and then make terms with Russia. The policy has failed       because of the unexpected resistance of the Belgians and the       refusal of Great Britain to buy peace at the expense of her honor.\"    A nearer and equally clear view is expressed for the French by M.  Clemenceau, who early in the war said:         \"For twenty-five years William II has made Europe live under the       weight of a horrible nightmare. He has found sheer delight in       keeping it in a state of perpetual anxiety over his boastful       utterances of power and the sharpened sword.         \"Five threats of war have been launched against us since 1875. At       the sixth he finds himself caught in the toils he had laid for us.       He threatened the very springs of England's power, though she was       more than pacific in her attitude toward him.         \"For many years, thanks to him, the Continent has had to join in a       giddy race of armaments, drying up the sources of economic       development and exposing our finances to a crisis which we shrank       from discussing. We must have done with this crowned comedian,       poet, musician, sailor, warrior, pastor; this commentator absorbed       in reconciling Hammurabi with the Bible, giving his opinion on       every problem of philosophy, speaking of everything, saying       nothing.\" M. Clemenceau summed up the Kaiser as \"another Nero; but       Rome in flames is not sufficient for him--he demands the       destruction of the universe.\"    The Socialist, Upton Sinclair, speaking at the time, blamed Russia as  well as Germany and Austria. He also inclined to the view that the  assassination at Sarajevo was instigated by Austria. He said:         \"I assert that never before in human history has there been a war       with less pretense of justification. It is the supreme crime of the       ages; a blow at the very throat of civilization. The three nations       which began it, Austria, Russia and Germany, are governed, the       first by a doddering imbecile, the second by a weak-minded       melancholic, and the third by an epileptic degenerate, drunk upon       the vision of himself as the war lord of Europe. Behind each of       These men is a little clique of blood-thirsty aristocrats. They       fall into a quarrel among themselves. The pretext is that Serbia       instigated the murder of the heir apparent to the Austrian throne.       There is good reason far believing that as a matter of fact this       murder was instigated by the war party in Austria, because the heir       apparent had democratic and anti-military tendencies. First they       murder him and then they use his death as a pretext for plunging       the whole of civilization into a murderous strife.\"    Herman Ridder, editor of the Staats-Zeitung of New York contributed a  German-American view. Mr. Ridder saw the handwriting on the wall and he  very soundly deprecated war and pictured its horrors. But he could not  forget that he was appealing to a large class that held the German  viewpoint. He therefore found it necessary to soften his phrase with  some hyphenated sophistry. He dared not say that Germany was the culprit  and would be the principal sufferer. His article was:         \"Sooner or later the nations engaged in war will find themselves       spent and weary. There will be victory for some, defeat for others,       and profit for none. There can hardly be any lasting laurels for       any of the contending parties. To change the map of Europe is not       worth the price of a single human life. Patriotism should never       rise above humanity.         \"The history of war is merely a succession of blunders. Each treaty       of peace sows the seed of future strife.         \"War offends our intelligence and outrages our sympathies. We can       but stand aside and murmur 'The pity of it"]]]
