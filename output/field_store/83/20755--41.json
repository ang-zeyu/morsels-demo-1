On the Rampart Street side of the house there are several sheds,    commanding an excellent range of the upper story. Detective Littleton,    Andrew Van Kuren of the Workhouse force and several others climbed upon    one of these and opened fire on the upper windows, shooting whenever    they could catch a glimpse of the assassin. Charles responded with his    rifle, and presently Van Kuren climbed down to find a better position.    He was crossing the end of the shed when he was killed.      Another of Charles's bullets found its billet in the body of Frank    Evans, an ex-member of the police force. He was on the Rampart Street    side firing whenever he had an opportunity. Officer J.W. Bofill and A.S.    Leclerc were also wounded in the fusillade.      While the events thus briefly outlined were transpiring time was a-wing,    and the cooler headed in the crowd began to realize that some quick and    desperate expedient must be adopted to insure the capture of the fiend    and to avert what might be a still greater tragedy than any yet enacted.    For nearly two hours the desperate monster had held his besiegers at    bay, darkness would soon be at hand and no one could predict what might    occur if he made a dash for liberty in the dark.      At this critical juncture it was suggested that the house be fired. The    plan came as an inspiration, and was adopted as the only solution of the    situation. The wretched old rookery counted for nothing against the    possible continued sacrifice of human life, and steps were immediately    taken to apply the torch. The fire department had been summoned to the    scene soon after the shooting began; its officers were warned to be    ready to prevent a spread of the conflagration, and several men rushed    into the lower right-hand room and started a blaze in one corner.      They first fired an old mattress, and soon smoke was pouring out in    dense volumes. It filled the interior of the ramshackle structure, and    it was evident that the upper story would soon become untenable. An    interval of tense excitement followed, and all eyes were strained for a    glimpse of the murderer when he emerged.      Then came the thrilling climax. Smoked out of his den, the desperate    fiend descended the stairs and entered the lower room. Some say he    dashed into the yard, glaring around vainly for some avenue of escape;    but, however that may be, he was soon a few moments later moving about    behind the lower windows. A dozen shots were sent through the wall in    the hope of reaching him, but he escaped unscathed. Then suddenly the    door on the right was flung open and he dashed out. With head lowered    and rifle raised ready to fire on the instant, Charles dashed straight    for the rear door of the front cottage. To reach it he had to traverse a    little walk shaded by a vineclad arbor. In the back room, with a cocked    revolver in his hand, was Dr. C.A. Noiret, a young medical student, who    was aiding the citizens' posse. As he sprang through the door Charles    fired a shot, and the bullet whizzed past the doctor's head. Before it    could be repeated Noiret's pistol cracked and the murderer reeled,    turned half around and fell on his back. The doctor sent another ball    into his body as he struck the floor, and half a dozen men, swarming    into the room from the front, riddled the corpse with bullets.      Private Adolph Anderson of the Connell Rifles was the first man to    announce the death of the wretch. He rushed to the street door, shouted    the news to the crowd, and a moment later the bleeding body was dragged    to the pavement and made the target of a score of pistols. It was shot,    kicked and beaten almost out of semblance to humanity....      The limp dead body was dropped at the edge of the sidewalk and from    there dragged to the muddy roadway by half a hundred hands. There in the    road more shots were fired into the body. Corporal Trenchard, a    brother-in-law of Porteus, led the shooting into the inanimate clay.    With each shot there was a cheer for the work that had been done and    curses and imprecations on the inanimate mass of riddled flesh that was    once Robert Charles.      Cries of \"Burn him! Burn him!\" were heard from Clio Street all the way    to Erato Street, and it was with difficulty that the crowd was    restrained from totally destroying the wretched dead body. Some of those    who agitated burning even secured a large vessel of kerosene, which had    previously been brought to the scene for the purpose of firing Charles's    refuge, and for a time it looked as though this vengeance might be    wreaked on the body. The officers, however, restrained this move,    although they were powerless to prevent the stamping and kicking of the    body by the enraged crowd.      After the infuriated citizens had vented their spleen on the body of the    dead Negro it was loaded into the patrol wagon. The police raised the    body of the heavy black from the ground and literally chucked it into    the space on the floor of the wagon between the seats. They threw it    with a curse hissed more than uttered and born of the bitterness which    was rankling in their breasts at the thought of Charles having taken so    wantonly the lives of four of the best of their fellow-officers.      When the murderer's body landed in the wagon it fell in such a position    that the hideously mutilated head, kicked, stamped and crushed, hung    over the end.      As the wagon moved off, the followers, who were protesting against its    being carried off, declaring that it should be burned, poked and struck    it with sticks, beating it into such a condition that it was utterly    impossible to tell what the man ever looked like.      As the patrol wagon rushed through the rough street, jerking and    swaying from one side of the thoroughfare to the other, the gory,    mud-smeared head swayed and swung and jerked about in a sickening    manner, the dark blood dripping on the steps and spattering the body of    the wagon and the trousers of the policemen standing on the step.      +MOB BRUTALITY+    The brutality of the mob was further shown by the unspeakable cruelty with  which it beat, shot and stabbed to death an unoffending colored man, name  unknown, who happened to be walking on the street with no thought that he  would be set upon and killed simply because he was a colored man. The  _Times-Democrat_'s description of the outrage is as follows:      While the fight between the Negro desperado and the citizens was in    progress yesterday afternoon at Clio and Saratoga Streets another    tragedy was being enacted downtown in the French quarter, but it was a    very one-sided affair. The object of the white man's wrath was, of    course, a Negro, but, unlike Charles, he showed no fight, but tried to    escape from the furious mob which was pursuing him, and which finally    put an end to his existence in a most cruel manner.      The Negro, whom no one seemed to know--at any rate no one could be found    in the vicinity of the killing who could tell who he was--was walking    along the levee, as near as could be learned, when he was attacked by a    number of white longshoremen or screwmen. For what reason, if there was    any reason other than the fact that he was a Negro, could not be    learned, and immediately they pounced upon him he broke ground and    started on a desperate run for his life.      The hunted Negro started off the levee toward the French Vegetable    Market, changed his course out the sidewalk toward Gallatin Street. The    angry, yelling mob was close at his heels, and increasing steadily as    each block was traversed. At Gallatin Street he turned up that    thoroughfare, doubled back into North Peters Street and ran into the    rear of No. 1216 of that street, which is occupied by Chris Reuter as a    commission store and residence.      He rushed frantically through the place and out on to the gallery on the    Gallatin Street side. From this gallery he jumped to the street and fell    flat on his back on the sidewalk. Springing to his feet as soon as    possible, with a leaden, hail fired by the angry mob whistling about    him, he turned to his merciless pursuers in an appealing way, and,    throwing up one hand, told them not to shoot any more, that they could    take him as he was.      But the hail of lead continued, and the unfortunate Negro finally    dropped to the sidewalk, mortally wounded. The mob then rushed upon him,    still continuing the fusillade, and upon reaching his body a number of    Italians, who had joined the howling mob, reached down and stabbed him    in the back and buttock with big knives. Others fired shots into his    head until his teeth were shot out, three shots having been fired into    his mouth. There were bullet wounds all over his body.      Others who witnessed the affair declared that the man was fired at as he    was running up the stairs leading to the living apartments above the    store, and that after jumping to the sidewalk and being knocked down by    a bullet he jumped up and ran across the street, then ran back and tried    to get back into the commission store. The Italians, it is said, were    all drunk, and had been shooting firecrackers. Tiring of this, they    began shooting at Negroes, and when the unfortunate man who was killed    ran by they joined in the chase.      No one was arrested for the shooting, the neighborhood having been    deserted by the police, who were sent up to the place where Charles was    fighting so desperately. No one could or would give the names of any of    those who had participated in the chase and the killing, nor could any    one be found who knew who the Negro was. The patrol wagon was called and    the terribly mutilated body sent to the morgue and the coroner notified.      The murdered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#6)"],[1,"it takes to relate it, the  tortured man was wafted beyond the grave to another fire, hotter and more  terrible than the one just experienced.    Curiosity seekers have carried away already all that was left of the  memorable event, even to pieces of charcoal. The cause of the crime was  that Henry Vance when a deputy policeman, in the course of his duty was  called to arrest Henry Smith for being drunk and disorderly. The Negro was  unruly, and Vance was forced to use his club. The Negro swore vengeance,  and several times assaulted Vance. In his greed for revenge, last  Thursday, he grabbed up the little girl and committed the crime. The  father is prostrated with grief and the mother now lies at death's door,  but she has lived to see the slayer of her innocent babe suffer the most  horrible death that could be conceived.      TORTURE BEYOND DESCRIPTION    Words to describe the awful torture inflicted upon Smith cannot be found.  The Negro, for a long time after starting on the journey to Paris, did not  realize his plight. At last when he was told that he must die by slow  torture he begged for protection. His agony was awful. He pleaded and  writhed in bodily and mental pain. Scarcely had the train reached Paris  than this torture commenced. His clothes were torn off piecemeal and  scattered in the crowd, people catching the shreds and putting them away  as mementos. The child's father, her brother, and two uncles then gathered  about the Negro as he lay fastened to the torture platform and thrust hot  irons into his quivering flesh. It was horrible--the man dying by slow  torture in the midst of smoke from his own burning flesh. Every groan from  the fiend, every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed  crowd of 10,000 persons. The mass of beings 600 yards in diameter, the  scaffold being the center. After burning the feet and legs, the hot  irons--plenty of fresh ones being at hand--were rolled up and down Smith's  stomach, back, and arms. Then the eyes were burned out and irons were  thrust down his throat.    The men of the Vance family having wreaked vengeance, the crowd piled all  kinds of combustible stuff around the scaffold, poured oil on it and set  it afire. The Negro rolled and tossed out of the mass, only to be pushed  back by the people nearest him. He tossed out again, and was roped and  pulled back. Hundreds of people turned away, but the vast crowd still  looked calmly on. People were here from every part of this section. They  came from Dallas, Fort Worth, Sherman, Denison, Bonham, Texarkana, Fort  Smith, Ark., and a party of fifteen came from Hempstead county, Arkansas,  where he was captured. Every train that came in was loaded to its utmost  capacity, and there were demands at many points for special trains to  bring the people here to see the unparalleled punishment for an  unparalleled crime. When the news of the burning went over the country  like wildfire, at every country town anvils boomed forth the announcement.      SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ASYLUM    It may not be amiss in connection with this awful affair, in proof of our  assertion that Smith was an imbecile, to give the testimony of a  well-known colored minister, who lived at Paris, Texas, at the time of the  lynching. He was a witness of the awful scenes there enacted, and  attempted, in the name of God and humanity, to interfere in the programme.  He barely escaped with his life, was driven out of the city and became an  exile because of his actions. Reverend King was in New York about the  middle of February, and he was there interviewed for a daily paper for  that city, and we quote his account as an eye witness of the affair. Said  he:      I was ridden out of Paris on a rail because I was the only man in Lamar    county to raise my voice against the lynching of Smith. I opposed the    illegal measures before the arrival of Henry Smith as a prisoner, and I    was warned that I might meet his fate if I was not careful; but the    sense of justice made me bold, and when I saw the poor wretch trembling    with fear, and got so near him that I could hear his teeth chatter, I    determined to stand by him to the last.      I hated him for his crime, but two crimes do not make a virtue; and in    the brief conversation I had with Smith I was more firmly convinced than    ever that he was irresponsible.      I had known Smith for years, and there were times when Smith was out of    his head for weeks. Two years ago I made an effort to have him put in an    asylum, but the white people were trying to fasten the murder of a young    colored girl upon him, and would not listen. For days before the murder    of the little Vance girl, Smith was out of his head and dangerous. He    had just undergone an attack of delirium tremens and was in no condition    to be allowed at large. He realized his condition, for I spoke with him    not three weeks ago, and in answer to my exhortations, he promised to    reform. The next time I saw him was on the day of his execution.      \"Drink did it! drink did it,\" he sobbed. Then bowing his face in his    hands, he asked: \"Is it true, did I kill her? Oh, my God, my God!\" For a    moment he seemed to forget the awful fate that awaited him, and his body    swayed to and fro with grief. Some one seized me by the shoulder and    hurled me back, and Smith fell writhing to the ground in terror as four    men seized his arms to drag him to the float on which he was to be    exhibited before he was finally burned at the stake.      I followed the procession and wept aloud as I saw little children of my    own race follow the unfortunate man and taunt him with jeers. Even at    the stake, children of both sexes and colors gathered in groups, and    when the father of the murdered child raised the hissing iron with which    he was about to torture the helpless victim, the children became as    frantic as the grown people and struggled forward to obtain places of    advantage.      It was terrible. One little tot scarcely older than little Myrtle Vance    clapped her baby hands as her father held her on his shoulders above the    heads of the people.      \"For God's sake,\" I shouted, \"send the children home.\"      \"No, no,\" shouted a hundred maddened voices; \"let them learn a lesson.\"      I love children, but as I looked about the little faces distorted with    passion and the bloodshot eyes of the cruel parents who held them high    in their arms, I thanked God that I have none of my own.      As the hot iron sank deep into poor Henry's flesh a hideous yell rent    the air, and, with a sound as terrible as the cry, of lost souls on    judgment day, 20,000 maddened people took up the victim's cry of agony    and a prolonged howl of maddened glee rent the air.      No one was himself now. Every man, woman and child in that awful crowd    was worked up to a greater frenzy than that which actuated Smith's    horrible crime. The people were capable of any new atrocity now, and as    Smith's yells became more and more frequent, it was difficult to hold    the crowd back, so anxious were the savages to participate in the    sickening tortures.      For half an hour I tried to pray as the beads of agony rolled down my    forehead and bathed my face.      For an instant a hush spread over the people. I could stand no more, and    with a superhuman effort dashed through the compact mass of humanity and    stood at the foot of the burning scaffold.      \"In the name of God,\" I cried, \"I command you to cease this torture.\"      The heavy butt of a Winchester rifle descended on my head and I fell to    the ground. Rough hands seized me and angry men bore me away, and I was    thankful.      At the outskirts of the crowd I was attacked again, and then several    men, no doubt glad to get away from the fearful place, escorted me to my    home, where I was allowed to take a small amount of clothing. A jeering    crowd gathered without, and when I appeared at the door ready hands    seized me and I was placed upon a rail, and, with curses and oaths,    taken to the railway station and placed upon a train. As the train moved    out some one thrust a roll of bills into my hand and said, \"God bless    you, but it was no use.\"    When asked if he should ever return to Paris, Mr. King said: \"I shall  never go south again. The impressions of that awful day will stay with me  forever.\"      LYNCHING OF INNOCENT MEN    (Lynched on Account of Relationship)    If no other reason appealed to the sober sense of the American people to  check the growth of Lynch Law, the absolute unreliability and recklessness  of the mob in inflicting punishment for crimes done, should do so. Several  instances of this spirit have occurred in the year past. In Louisiana,  near New Orleans, in July, 1893, Roselius Julian, a colored man, shot and  killed a white judge, named Victor Estopinal. The cause of the shooting  has never been definitely ascertained. It is claimed that the Negro  resented an insult to his wife, and the killing of the white man was an  act of a Negro (who dared) to defend his home. The judge was killed in the  court house, and Julian, heavily armed, made his escape to the swamps near  the city. He has never been apprehended, nor has any information ever been  gleaned as to his whereabouts. A mob determined to secure the fugitive  murderer and burn him alive. The swamps were hunted through and through in  vain, when, being unable to wreak their revenge upon the murderer, the mob  turned its attention to his unfortunate relatives. Dispatches from New  Orleans, dated September 19, 1893, described the affair as follows:      Posses were immediately organized and the surrounding country was    scoured, but the search was fruitless so far as the real criminal was    concerned. The mother, three brothers and two sisters of the Negro were    arrested yesterday at the Black Ridge in the rear of the city by the"]]]
