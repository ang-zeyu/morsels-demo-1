Let them remember that the Author of their Faith has in His Kitab-i-Aqdas,  the Mother-Book of His Revelation, singled out the company of the  Presidents of their countries, together with those of the North American  continent, and addressed them in terms that sharply contrast with the dire  warnings and condemnatory words addressed directly and indirectly, to the  King of Prussia, the French and Austrian Emperors and the Sultan of  Turkey, who, together with those Presidents, are the only sovereigns and  rulers specifically mentioned by Him in that Book.    \"Hearken ye, O rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics  therein!\" is His summons sounded in that mighty Charter of the future  world civilization, \"unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of  Eternity: There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving,  the All-Bountiful. Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of  justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the  remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you  He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise. The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station,  whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. Take ye advantage  of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that  whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know it. O concourse of rulers! Give  ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur:  Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the  All-Knowing. Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the  oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord,  the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\"    Let them ponder the honor which the Author of the Revelation Himself has  chosen to confer upon their countries, the obligations which that honor  automatically brings in its wake, the opportunities it offers, the power  it releases for the removal of all obstacles, however formidable, which  may be encountered in their path, and the promise of guidance it implies  for the attainment of the objectives alluded to in these memorable  passages.    To the eager, the warm-hearted, the spiritually minded and staunch members  of these Latin American Baha'i communities who, among the followers of  Baha'u'llah, already constitute the most considerable body of recruits  from the ranks of the most deeply entrenched and powerful Church of  Christendom; whose motherlands have been chosen as the scene of the  earliest victories won by the prosecutors of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan;  launched on their crusade for the spiritual conquest of the whole planet;  the establishment of whose projected national spiritual assemblies must  constitute a notable landmark in the second epoch of the Formative Age of  the Baha'i Dispensation; whose leading spiritual assemblies are now  establishing direct contact with the World Center of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah in the Holy Land; the photographs of whose elected  representatives, at their chief centers, will soon adorn the walls of His  Mansion at Bahji; a few of whose members have already arisen to carry back  the torch of divine guidance entrusted to their care to the peoples and  races from which they have sprung--to this privileged, this youngest, this  dynamic and highly promising member of the organic Baha'i World Community,  I feel moved, before I dismiss this aspect of my theme, to direct this  general appeal to rise to the heights of the glorious opportunity which  destiny is unfolding before its members. Theirs is the opportunity, if  they but seize it, to adorn the opening pages of the annals of the second  Baha'i century with a tale of deeds approaching in valor those with which  their Persian brethren have illuminated the opening years of the first,  and comparable with the exploits more recently achieved by their North  American fellow-believers and which have shed such luster on the closing  decade of that same century.            SPIRITUAL CRUSADE TO BE LAUNCHED IN EUROPE      To the fourth, and by far the most momentous, the most arduous, the most  challenging task to be carried out under the Second Seven Year Plan--the  systematic launching of a crusade in a mighty, a tormented, a spiritually  famished continent, a continent drawn, in recent years through political  developments as well as through improvement in the means of  transportation, so close to the great republic of the West, and  constituting a stepping-stone on the road leading to the redemption of the  Old World--I must now direct the attention of my readers.    This as yet unfought and unbelievably potent crusade, embarked upon in the  opening decade of the second century of the Baha'i Era, signalizing the  commencement of the second epoch of the Formative Age of the Dispensation  of Baha'u'llah, and marking the first stage in the propulsion of a  divinely conceived Plan across the borders of the Western Hemisphere,  must, as its pace augments, reveal the first signs and tokens which, as  anticipated by the Author of the Plan Himself, must accompany the carrying  of His Father's Message across the ocean, at the hands of His \"apostles,\"  from the shores of their homeland to the European continent. \"The moment,\"  is His powerfully sustaining, gloriously inspiring promise, \"this Divine  Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of  America, and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of  Africa and of Australia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this  community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an  everlasting dominion. Then will all the peoples of the world witness that  this community is spiritually illumined and divinely guided. Then will the  whole earth resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness.\"    The first stage in this transatlantic field of service which those  crusading for the Cause of Baha'u'llah in the Western Hemisphere are now  entering is a step fraught with possibilities such as no mind can  adequately envisage. Its challenge is overwhelming and its potentialities  unfathomable. Its hazards, rigors and pitfalls are numerous, its field  immense, the number of its promoters as yet utterly inadequate, the  resources required for its effective prosecution barely tapped. The races,  nations and classes included within its orbit are numerous and highly  diversified, and the prizes to be won by its victors incalculably great.  The hatreds that inflame, the rivalries that agitate, the controversies  that confuse, the miseries that afflict, these races, nations and classes  are bitter and of long standing. The influence and fanaticism, whether  ecclesiastical or political, of potentially hostile organizations, firmly  entrenched within their ancestral strongholds, are formidable.    The members of the North American Baha'i Community, to whose care the  immediate destinies of this fate-laden crusade have been entrusted, are  standing at a new crossroads. Behind them is an imperishable record, brief  yet illustrious, of feats performed over the entire range of the Western  Hemisphere. Before them stretches a vista alluring in its as yet hazy  outlines, entrancing in its magnitude, reaching to the far horizons of as  yet unconquered territories. They can look back, since that crusade was  launched, upon a decade of modest beginnings, of toilsome labors, of  richly deserved rewards. They now look forward to successive epochs  reaching as far as the fringes of that Golden Age that is to be, glowing  in the light of God-given promises, destined to be traversed at the cost  of infinite toil and of heroic self-sacrifice.    They can neither retrace their steps, nor falter, nor even afford to mark  time. The sands are running out, the short span of six brief years  intervening between the present hour and the termination of the second  stage of the enterprise on which they have embarked will soon expire. The  hosts on high, having sounded the signal, are impatient to rush forward,  and demonstrate anew the irresistible force of their might. Europe, in the  throes of the aftermath of a horribly devastating conflict, calls  desperately, in one of the darkest hours of its history, for that  sovereign remedy which only the Plan, conceived by a divinely appointed  Physician, can administer. Sister communities, in the north and in the  heart of that continent, alive to the needs, the opportunities and the  glorious mission of the vanguard of Baha'u'llah's crusaders, now landing  on the shores of that agitated continent, are only too eager to reinforce  the stupendous exertions that must needs be made for its ultimate  redemption. Nor will other sister communities further afield refrain, for  a moment, from lending a helping hand, once the progress of this gigantic  movement now set in motion is accelerated. Above and beyond them all,  unsleeping, ever-solicitous, unerring, is the Pilot of their bark, the  Charterer of their course, the Founder of their spiritual fellowship, the  Bestower of that primacy which is the hallmark of their destiny.            EVOLVING STRONGHOLDS IN TEN INITIAL COUNTRIES      The ten countries, constituting the initial field wherein the prowess of  these crusaders must, in the years immediately ahead, be exhibited, and in  whose capitals the foundations of the embryonic Order of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah must preferably be unassailably laid, must each evolve into  strongholds from which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#6)"],[1," \"The believers, for the sake of the Cause, now in the period of its  infancy, should accept their duties in a spirit a self-sacrifice, and  should be animated by the desire to uphold the verdict of the electorate,  and to lend their share of assistance however difficult the circumstances,  to the effective administration of the affairs of the Faith.    \"The same sanction should apply to those who persistently refuse to  dissociate themselves from political and ecclesiastical activities. This  is a general principle which is being maintained throughout the Baha'i  world...\"            60: ELECTIONS (BAHA'I)      \"I feel that reference to personalities before the election would give  rise to misunderstanding and differences. What the friends should do is  get thoroughly acquainted with one another, to exchange views, to mix  freely and discuss among themselves the requirements and qualifications  for such a membership without reference or application, however indirect,  to particular individuals. We should refrain from influencing the opinion  of others, of canvassing for any particular individual, but should stress  the necessity of getting fully acquainted with the qualifications of  membership referred to in our Beloved's Tablets of learning more about one  another through direct, personal experience rather than through the  reports and opinions of our friends.\"            61: ELECTIONS (BAHA'I) (TO ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS)      \"There is no objection in principle to an Assembly being re-elected  whether in toto or in part, provided the members are considered to be well  qualified for that post. It is individual merit that counts. Novelty, or  the mere act of renewal of elections, are purely secondary considerations.  Changes in Assembly membership would be welcome so far as they do not  prejudice the quality of such membership. Once Assembly elections are  over, the results should be conscientiously and unquestionably accepted by  the entire body of the believers, not necessarily because they represent  the Voice of Truth, or the Will of Baha'u'llah, but for the supreme  purpose of maintaining unity and harmony in the community.\"            62: ELECTIONS (ASSEMBLY VOTING)      \"With these Assemblies, Local as well as National, harmoniously,  vigorously and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, the  only means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have  been assured. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly  established, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay  down the principle which shall direct, as long as it deems advisable, the  affairs of the Cause.    \"Pending the establishment, and to insure uniformity throughout the East  and throughout the West, all Local Assemblies will have to be re-elected  once a year, during the first day of Ridvan, and the result of polling, if  possible, be declared on that day.\"            63: ELECTIONS (THE CHARACTER OF BAHA'I)      \"Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurance that every  Assembly elected in that rarified atmosphere of selflessness and  detachment is in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly  inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and  with cheerfulness ... the elector ... is called upon to vote for none but  those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold... Hence it  is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider without the least trace  of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration,  the names of only those who can best combine the necessary qualities of  unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of  recognized ability and mature experience... Nothing short of the  all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance and Love can enable  this newly enfolded order to gather strength and flourish amid the storm  and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fullness of time vindicate its  high claim to be universally recognized as the one Haven of abiding  felicity and peace.\"            64: ELECTION OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES (RADICAL CHANGES NOT ADVISED)      \"Regarding your questions concerning the advisability of changing the  basis of the National Assembly's election and confining it to the body of  delegates or of limiting the term of office: He feels that as any such  changes are of a radical nature and should therefore apply to the National  Spiritual Assemblies of other countries, they are inadvisable and  premature, both for this reason and because of their very nature.    \"What is needed is to get the administration in its present form to run  more efficiently and at the same time to build up a higher sense of the  responsibility among the body of the believers. They should be encouraged  to think more, not only about the qualifications of their elected bodies,  but also about such things as you mention, the law of averages, the age  and indisposition of some of the members, etc.    \"When we look back and see what the administration has accomplished in  twenty-odd years, indeed what it has done in the last seven years, we see  what strides forward have been made. Far greater tasks lie ahead, but the  Guardian does not feel that the way to meet them is to change the present  system but rather to perfect it by educating the believers and training  them, holding more conferences, publishing more news for Baha'is, getting  more people active.\"            65: ELECTIONS, REGARDING (IN THE UNITED STATES)      \"The Guardian has written the National Assembly in detail and given them  the principle upon which he would like to see them act. He has asked them  to advise the friends accordingly and also to expound the principles so as  to apply to the local conditions in America.\"    \"To facilitate matters and avoid misunderstandings he prefers to refer you  and the individual friends to them (The National Assembly). He is sure  that you will obtain full satisfaction by putting the question to them.  The purpose of the Guardian in this is not to avoid the issue but only to  facilitate matters and eliminate misunderstandings. In all such matters  the friends should first approach the Local, then the National Assembly  and only in case they can obtain no satisfaction should they approach the  Guardian on these matters. This way many difficulties will be avoided.\"            66: EMMANUEL, HIS HIGHNESS      \"In connection with your question regarding the reference made by  'Abdu'l-Baha to 'His Highness Emmanuel' in Vol. III of His Tablets; this  obviously refers to the Bab, as the text shows it clearly, and is in no  way a reference to Swedenborg.\"            67: ESPERANTO (THE SUBJECT OF)      \"Regarding the subject of Esperanto; it should be made clear to the  believers that while the teaching of that language has been repeatedly  encouraged by 'Abdu'l-Baha, there is no reference either from Him or from  Baha'u'llah that can make us believe that it will necessarily develop into  the international auxiliary language of the future. Baha'u'llah has  specified in His Writings that such a language will either have to be  chosen from one of the existing languages, or an entirely new one should  be created to serve as a medium of exchange between the nations and  peoples of the world. Pending this final choice, the Baha'is are advised  to study Esperanto only in consideration of the fact that the learning of  this language can considerably facilitate intercommunication between  individuals, groups and Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world in the  present stage of the evolution of the Faith.\"            68: EVOLUTION, MAN'S      \"You have asked as to what point in man's evolution he becomes conscious  of self. This consciousness of self in man is a gradual process, and does  not start at a definite point. It grows in him in this world and continues  to do so in the future spiritual world.    \"Man can certainly recall past experiences in his evolution, and even when  his soul leaves this world it will still remember the past.\"            69: FAMILY TIES, SPIRITUAL TIES (VS.)      \"Deep as are family ties, we must always remember that the spiritual ties  are far deeper; they are everlasting and survive death, whereas physical  ties, unless supported by spiritual bonds, are confined to this life. You  should do all in your power, through prayer and example, to open the eyes  of your family to the Baha'i Faith, but do not grieve too much over their  actions. Turn to your Baha'i brothers and sisters who are living with you  in the Light of the Kingdom.    \"Indeed, the believers have not yet fully learned to draw on each other's  strength and consolation in time of need. The Cause of God is endowed with  tremendous powers, and the reason the believers do not gain more from it  is because they have not learned to draw fully on these mighty forces of  love and strength and harmony generated by the Faith.\"            70: FAST (NECESSARY PERMISSION FOR)      \"With reference to your son's request for advice regarding the observance  of the Baha'i Fast; much as the Guardian realizes the difficulty which a  believer of his position, attending a military school, will have to  encounter if he wishes to strictly conform to the regulations of the Fast,  he nevertheless would advise him to make every effort to obtain from the  school authorities the necessary permission. In case his request is  refused the only alternative for him would be to obey his superior.\"            71: FASTING (THE ORDINANCE OF)      \"As regards fasting, it constitutes, together with the obligatory prayers,  the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of God. They act as  stimulants to the soul, strengthen, revive and purify it, and thus insure  its steady development.\"    \"The ordinance of fasting is, as is the case with these three prayers  (obligatory) a spiritual and vital obligation enjoined by Baha'u'llah upon  every"]]]
