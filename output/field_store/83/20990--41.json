[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#6)"],[1," of the life of the Baha'i community. \"The  companions of God,\" Baha'u'llah Himself has declared, \"are, in this day,  the lump that must leaven the peoples of the world. They must show forth  such trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance, such deeds and  character that all mankind may profit by their example.\" \"I swear by Him  Who is the Most Great Ocean!\" He again affirms, \"Within the very breath of  such souls as are pure and sanctified far-reaching potentialities are  hidden. So great are these potentialities that they exercise their  influence upon all created things.\" \"He is the true servant of God,\" He,  in another passage has written, \"who, in this day, were he to pass through  cities of silver and gold, would not deign to look upon them, and whose  heart would remain pure and undefiled from whatever things can be seen in  this world, be they its goods or its treasures. I swear by the Sun of  Truth! The breath of such a man is endowed with potency, and his words  with attraction.\" \"By Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of sanctity!\"  He, still more emphatically, has revealed, \"If the whole earth were to be  converted into silver and gold, no man who can be said to have truly  ascended into the heaven of faith and certitude would deign to regard it,  much less to seize and keep it.... They who dwell within the Tabernacle of  God, and are established upon the seats of everlasting glory, will refuse,  though they be dying of hunger, to stretch their hands, and seize  unlawfully the property of their neighbor, however vile and worthless he  may be. The purpose of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to  summon all mankind to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety and  trustworthiness, to resignation and submissiveness to the will of God, to  forbearance and kindliness, to uprightness and wisdom. His object is to  array every man with the mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn him  with the ornament of holy and goodly deeds.\" \"We have admonished all the  loved ones of God,\" He insists, \"to take heed lest the hem of Our sacred  vesture be smirched with the mire of unlawful deeds, or be stained with  the dust of reprehensible conduct.\" \"Cleave unto righteousness, O people  of Baha,\" He thus exhorts them, \"This, verily, is the commandment which  this wronged One hath given unto you, and the first choice of His  unrestrained will for every one of you.\" \"A good character,\" He explains,  \"is, verily, the best mantle for men from God. With it He adorneth the  temples of His loved ones. By My life! The light of a good character  surpasseth the light of the sun and the radiance thereof.\" \"One righteous  act,\" He, again, has written, \"is endowed with a potency that can so  elevate the dust as to cause it to pass beyond the heaven of heavens. It  can tear every bond asunder, and hath the power to restore the force that  hath spent itself and vanished.... Be pure, O people of God, be pure; be  righteous, be righteous.... Say: O people of God! That which can insure  the victory of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, His hosts and helpers on  earth, have been set down in the sacred Books and Scriptures, and are as  clear and manifest as the sun. These hosts are such righteous deeds, such  conduct and character, as are acceptable in His sight. Whoso ariseth, in  this Day, to aid Our Cause, and summoneth to his assistance the hosts of a  praiseworthy character and upright conduct, the influence from such an  action will, most certainly, be diffused throughout the whole world.\" \"The  betterment of the world,\" is yet another statement, \"can be accomplished  through pure and goodly deeds, through commendable and seemly conduct.\"  \"Be fair to yourselves and to others,\" He thus counseleth them, \"that the  evidences of justice may be revealed through your deeds among Our faithful  servants.\" \"Equity,\" He also has written, \"is the most fundamental among  human virtues. The evaluation of all things must needs depend upon it.\"  And again, \"Observe equity in your judgment, ye men of understanding  heart! He that is unjust in his judgment is destitute of the  characteristics that distinguish man's station.\" \"Beautify your tongues, O  people,\" He further admonishes them, \"with truthfulness, and adorn your  souls with the ornament of honesty. Beware, O people, that ye deal not  treacherously with anyone. Be ye the trustees of God amongst His  creatures, and the emblems of His generosity amidst His people.\" \"Let your  eye be chaste,\" is yet another counsel, \"your hand faithful, your tongue  truthful, and your heart enlightened.\" \"Be an ornament to the countenance  of truth,\" is yet another admonition, \"a crown to the brow of fidelity, a  pillar of the temple of righteousness, a breath of life to the body of  mankind, an ensign of the hosts of justice, a luminary above the horizon  of virtue.\" \"Let truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning,\" is still  another admonition; \"suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of  forbearance and justice, that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted  from your hearts upon all created things. Say: Beware, O people of Baha,  lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from their deeds.  Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the  signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments. Let your acts be a  guide unto all mankind, for the professions of most men, be they high or  low, differ from their conduct. It is through your deeds that ye can  distinguish yourselves from others. Through them the brightness of your  light can be shed upon the whole earth. Happy is the man that heedeth My  counsel, and keepeth the precepts prescribed by Him Who is the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"    \"O army of God!\" writes 'Abdu'l-Baha, \"Through the protection and help  vouchsafed by the Blessed Beauty--may my life be a sacrifice to His loved  ones--ye must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out  distinguished and brilliant as the sun among other souls. Should any one  of you enter a city, he should become a center of attraction by reason of  his sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his  truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so  that the people of that city may cry out and say: 'This man is  unquestionably a Baha'i, for his manners, his behavior, his conduct, his  morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the  Baha'is.' Not until ye attain this station can ye be said to have been  faithful to the Covenant and Testament of God.\" \"The most vital duty, in  this day,\" He, moreover, has written, \"is to purify your characters, to  correct your manners, and improve your conduct. The beloved of the  Merciful must show forth such character and conduct among His creatures,  that the fragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and  may quicken the dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation of God  and the dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to educate the  souls of men, and refine the character of every living man....\"  \"Truthfulness,\" He asserts, \"is the foundation of all human virtues.  Without truthfulness progress and success, in all the worlds of God, are  impossible for any soul. When this holy attribute is established in man,  all the divine qualities will also be acquired.\"    Such a rectitude of conduct must manifest itself, with ever-increasing  potency, in every verdict which the elected representatives of the Baha'i  community, in whatever capacity they may find themselves, may be called  upon to pronounce. It must be constantly reflected in the business  dealings of all its members, in their domestic lives, in all manner of  employment, and in any service they may, in the future, render their  government or people. It must be exemplified in the conduct of all Baha'i  electors, when exercising their sacred rights and functions. It must  characterize the attitude of every loyal believer towards nonacceptance of  political posts, nonidentification with political parties,  nonparticipation in political controversies, and nonmembership in  political organizations and ecclesiastical institutions. It must reveal  itself in the uncompromising adherence of all, whether young or old, to  the clearly enunciated and fundamental principles laid down by  'Abdu'l-Baha in His addresses, and to the laws and ordinances revealed by  Baha'u'llah in His Most Holy Book. It must be demonstrated in the  impartiality of every defender of the Faith against its enemies, in his  fair-mindedness in recognizing any merits that enemy may possess, and in  his honesty in discharging any obligations he may have towards him. It  must constitute the brightest ornament of the life, the pursuits, the  exertions, and the utterances of every Baha'i teacher, whether laboring at  home or abroad, whether in the front ranks of the teaching force, or  occupying a less active and responsible position. It must be made the  hallmark of that numerically small, yet intensely dynamic and highly  responsible body of the elected national representatives of every Baha'i  community, which constitutes the sustaining pillar, and the sole  instrument for the election, in every community, of that Universal House  whose very name and title, as ordained by Baha'u'llah, symbolizes that  rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission to safeguard and  enforce.    So great and transcendental is this principle of Divine justice, a  principle that must be regarded as the crowning distinction of all Local  and National Assemblies, in their capacity as forerunners of the Universal  House of Justice, that Baha'u'llah Himself subordinates His personal  inclination and wish to the all-compelling force of its demands and  implications. \"God is My witness!\" He thus explains, \"were it not contrary  to the Law of God, I would have kissed the hand of My would-be murderer,  and would cause"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19250"],[0,"`Abdu'l-Bahá in London (#6)"],[1,"d, for it was intended for the  furtherance and progress of unity among all nations and a better  international understanding. The purpose was good. The causes of dispute  among different nations are always due to one of the following classes of  prejudice: racial, lingual, theological, personal, and prejudices of  custom and tradition. It requires a universal active force to overcome  these differences. A small disease needs a small remedy, but a disease  which pervades the whole body needs a very strong remedy. A small lamp may  light a room, a larger would light a house, a larger still might shine  through the city, but the sun is needed to light the whole world.    The differences in language cause disunion between nations. There must be  one universal language. The diversity in Faiths is also a cause of  separation. The true foundation of all faiths must be established, the  outer differences abolished. There must be a Oneness of Faith. To end all  these differences is a very hard task. The whole world is sick, and needs  the power of the Great Healer.    These meetings teach us that Unity is good, and that suppression (slavery  under the yoke of tradition and prejudice) is the cause of disunion. To  know this is not enough. All knowledge is good, but it can bear no fruit  except by action. It is well to know that riches are good, but that  knowledge will not make a man rich; he must work, he must put his  knowledge into practice. We hope the people realize and know that unity is  good, and we also hope that they will not be content to stand still in  that knowledge. Do not only say that Unity, Love and Brotherhood are good;  you must work for their realization.    The Czar of Russia suggested the Hague Peace Conference and proposed a  decrease in armament for all nations. In this Conference it was proved  that Peace was beneficial to all countries, and that war destroyed trade,  etc. The Czar's words were admirable though after the conference was over  he himself was the first to declare war (against Japan).    Knowledge is not enough; we hope by the Love of God we shall put it into  practice. A spiritual universal Force is needed for this. Meetings are  good for engendering spiritual force. To know that it is possible to reach  a state of perfection, is good; to march forward on the path is better. We  know that to help the poor and to be merciful is good and pleases God, but  knowledge alone does not feed the starving man, nor can the poor be warmed  by knowledge or words in the bitter winter; we must give the practical  help of Loving-kindness.          What of the Peace Congress?      It resembles many drunkards gathered together to protest against the  drinking of alcohol. They say drink is horrible and they straightway go  out from the house to drink again.          Theosophy      When 'Abdu'l-Baha was asked if he recognized the good which the  Theosophical Society has done. He replied:    I know it; I think a great deal of it. I know that their desire is to  serve mankind. I thank this noble Society in the name of all Baha'is and  for myself. I hope that by God's help these friends will succeed in  bringing about love and unity. It is a great work and needs the effort of  all the servants of God!          Peace      During the last six thousand years nations have hated one another, it is  now time to stop. War must cease. Let us be united and love one another  and await the result. We know the effects of war are bad. So let us try,  as an experiment, peace, and if the results of peace are bad, then we can  choose if it would be better to go back to the old state of war! Let us in  any case make the experiment. If we see that unity brings Light we shall  continue it. For six thousand years we have been walking on the left-hand  path; let us walk on the right-hand path now. We have passed many  centuries in darkness, let us advance towards the light.    Question.--(It was remarked, Theosophy teaches that truth in all the  religions is the same): Does the task of unifying all religions have  'Abdu'l-Baha's sympathy?    Answer.--Surely.    Question.--Can 'Abdu'l-Baha suggest any lines on which it could best be  worked out?    Answer.--Search for truth. Seek the realities in all religions. Put aside  all superstitions. Many of us do not realize the Reality of all Religions.          Divine Manifestations      Question.--What is 'Abdu'l-Baha's teaching concerning the different Divine  manifestations?    Answer.--The Reality of all is One. Truth is one. Religions are like the  branches of one Tree. One branch is high, one is low and one in the  centre, yet all draw their life from the one stem. One branch bears fruit  and others are not laden so abundantly. All the Prophets are lights, they  only differ in degree; they shine like brilliant heavenly bodies, each  have their appointed place and time of ascension. Some are like lamps,  some like the moon, some like distant stars, and a few are like the sun,  shining from one end of the earth to the other. All have the same Light to  give, yet they are different in degree.          Buddhism      Some referred to the teaching of Buddha. 'Abdu'l-Baha said: The real  teaching of Buddha is the same as the teaching of Jesus Christ. The  teachings of all the Prophets are the same in character. Now men have  changed the teaching. If you look at the present practice of the Buddhist  religion, you will see that there is little of the Reality left. Many  worship idols although their teaching forbids it.    Buddha had disciples and he wished to send them out into the world to  teach, so he asked them questions to see if they were prepared as he would  have them be. \"When you go to the East and to the West,\" said the Buddha,  \"and the people shut their doors to you and refuse to speak to you, what  will you do?\"--The disciples answered and said: \"We shall be very thankful  that they do us no harm.\"--\"Then if they do you harm and mock, what will  you do?\"--\"We shall be very thankful that they do not give us worse  treatment.\"--\"If they throw you into prison?\"--\"We shall still be grateful  that they do not kill us.\"--\"What if they were to kill you?\" the Master  asked for the last time. \"Still,\" answered the disciples, \"we will be  thankful, for they cause us to be martyrs. What more glorious fate is  there than this, to die for the glory of God?\" And the Buddha said: \"Well  done!\"    The teaching of Buddha was like a young and beautiful child, and now it  has become as an old and decrepit man. Like the aged man it cannot see, it  cannot hear, it cannot remember anything. Why go so far back? Consider the  laws of the Old Testament: the Jews do not follow Moses as their example  nor keep his commands. So it is with many other religions.    How can we get the power to follow the right path?    By putting the teaching into practice power will be given. You know which  path to follow: you cannot be mistaken, for there's a great distinction  between God and evil, between Light and darkness, Truth and falsehood,  Love and hatred, Generosity and meanness, Education and ignorance, Faith  in God and superstition, good Laws and unjust laws.          Faith      How can one increase in faith?    You must strive. A child does not know, in learning he obtains knowledge.  search for Truth.    There are three kinds of Faith: first, that which is from tradition and  birth. For example: a child is born of Muhammadan parents, he is a  Muhammadan. This faith is weak traditional faith: second, that which comes  from Knowledge, and is the faith of understanding. This is good, but there  is a better, the faith of practice. This is real faith.    We hear there is an invention, we believe it is good; then we come and see  it. We hear that there is wealth, we see it; we work hard for it, and  become rich ourselves and so help others. We know and we see the Light, we  go close to it, are warmed by it, and reflect its rays on others; this is  real faith, and thus we receive power to become the eternal sons of God.          Healing      'Abdu'l-Baha said: Disease is of two kinds: material and spiritual.    Take for instance, a cut hand; if you pray for the cut to be healed and do  not stop its bleeding, you will not do much good; a material remedy is  needed.    Sometimes if the nervous system is paralyzed through fear, a spiritual  remedy is necessary. Madness, incurable otherwise, can be cured through  prayer. It often happens that sorrow makes one ill, this can be cured by  spiritual means.          Philanthropic Societies      Someone asked if the Humanitarian Society was good.--Yes all societies, all  organizations, working for the betterment of the human race are good, very  good. All who work for their brothers and sisters have Baha'u'llah's  blessing. They will surely succeed.    'Abdu'l-Baha said: It makes me happy to see all the believers in London.  You are all, of every race and creed, members of one family. The teaching  of Baha'u'llah constrains you to realize your brotherhood to one another.          Man's Comprehension of God and of Higher Worlds      To man, the Essence of God is incomprehensible, so also are the worlds  beyond this, and their condition. It is given to man to obtain knowledge,  to attain to great spiritual perfection, to discover hidden truths and to  manifest even the attributes of God; but still man cannot comprehend the  Essence of God. Where the ever-widening circle of man's knowledge meets  the spiritual world a Manifestation of God is sent to mirror forth His  splendour.          Divine Manifestations      Is the Divine Manifestation, God?    Yes, and yet not in Essence. A Divine Manifestation is as a mirror  reflecting the light of the Sun. The light is the same and yet the mirror  is not the Sun. All the Manifestations of God bring the same Light; they  only differ in degree, not in reality. The Truth is one. The light is the  same though the lamps may be"]]]
