It could but make the sensitive  soul super-sensitive, introspective, morbidly alive to uncanny and weird  suggestions, and strangely afraid of the temptation of enjoying earthly  pleasures. Its followers dared not allow themselves to become deeply  attached to anything temporal; for such an emotion was the device of the  devil, and God would surely remove the object of such affection. Whether  through anger or jealousy or kindness, the Creator did this, the Puritan  woman seems not to have stopped to consider; her belief was sufficient  that earthly desires and even natural love must be repressed. Winthrop,  a staunch supporter of colonial New England creeds as well as of  independence, gives us an example of God's actions in such a matter: \"A  godly woman of the church of Boston, dwelling sometime in London,  brought with her a parcel of very fine linen of great value, which she  set her heart too much upon, and had been at charge to have it all newly  washed, and curiously folded and pressed, and so left it in press in her  parlor over night.\" Through the carelessness of a servant, the package  caught on fire and was totally destroyed. \"But it pleased God that the  loss of this linen did her much good, both in taking off her heart from  worldly comforts, and in preparing her for a far greater affliction by  the untimely death of her husband....\"[9]    Especially did this doctrine apply to the love of human beings. How  often must it have grieved the Puritan mother to realize that she must  exercise unceasing care lest she love her children too intensely! For  the passionate love of a mother for her babe was but a rash temptation  to an ever-watchful and ever-jealous God to snatch the little one away.  Preachers declared it in the pulpit, and writers emphasized it in their  books; the trusting and faithful woman dared not believe otherwise.  Once more we may turn to Winthrop for proof of this terrifying doctrine:    \"God will be sanctified in them that come near him. Two others were the  children of one of the Church of Boston. While their parents were at the  lecture, the boy (being about seven years of age), having a small staff  in his hand, ran down upon the ice towards a boat he saw, and the ice  breaking, he fell in, but his staff kept him up, till his sister, about  fourteen years old, ran down to save her brother (though there were four  men at hand, and called to her not to go, being themselves hasting to  save him) and so drowned herself and him also, being past recovery ere  the men could come at them, and could easily reach ground with their  feet. The parents had no more sons, and confessed they had been too  indulgent towards him, and had set their hearts overmuch upon him.\"[10]    And again, what mother could be certain that punishment for her own  petty errors might not be wreaked upon her innocent child? For the faith  of the day did not demand that the sinner receive upon himself the  recompense for his deeds; the mighty Ruler above could and would  arbitrarily choose as the victim the offspring of an erring parent. Says  Winthrop in the _History of New England_, mentioned above:    \"This puts me in mind of another child very strangely drowned a little  before winter. The parents were also members of the church of Boston.  The father had undertaken to maintain the mill-dam, and being at work  upon it (with some help he had hired), in the afternoon of the last day  of the week, night came upon them before they had finished what they  intended, and his conscience began to put him in mind of the Lord's day,  and he was troubled, yet went on and wrought an hour within night. The  next day, after evening exercise, and after they had supped, the mother  put two children to bed in the room where themselves did lie, and they  went out to visit a neighbor. When they returned, they continued about  an hour in the room, and missed not the child, but then the mother going  to the bed, and not finding her youngest child (a daughter about five  years of age), after much search she found it drowned in a well in her  cellar; which was very observable, as by a special hand of God, that the  child should go out of that room into another in the dark, and then fall  down at a trap-door, or go down the stairs, and so into the well in the  farther end of the cellar, the top of the well and the water being even  with the ground. But the father, freely in the open congregation, did  acknowledge it the righteous hand of God for his profaning his holy day  against the checks of his own conscience.\"    There was a certain amount of pitiable egotism in all this. Seemingly  God had very little to do except watch the Puritans. It reminds one of  the two resolutions tradition says that some Puritan leader suggested:  Resolved, firstly, that the saints shall inherit the earth; resolved,  secondly, that we are the saints. A supernatural or divine explanation  seems to have been sought for all events; natural causes were too  frequently ignored. The super-sensitive almost morbid nature resulting  from such an attitude caused far-fetched hypotheses; God was in every  incident and every act or accident. We may turn again to Winthrop's  _History_ for an illustration:    \"1648. The synod met at Cambridge. Mr. Allen preached. It fell out,  about the midst of his sermon, there came a snake into the seat where  many elders sate behind the preacher. Divers elders shifted from it, but  Mr. Thomson, one of the elders of Braintree, (a man of much faith) trod  upon the head of it, until it was killed. This being so remarkable, and  nothing falling out but by divine providence, it is out of doubt, the  Lord discovered somewhat of his mind in it. The serpent is the devil;  the synod, the representative of the churches of Christ in New England.  The devil had formerly and lately attempted their disturbance and  dissolution; but their faith in the seed of the woman overcame him and  crushed his head.\"    There was a further belief that God in hasty anger often wreaked instant  vengeance upon those who displeased Him, and this doctrine doubtless  kept many a Puritan in constant dread lest the hour of retribution  should come upon him without warning. How often the mother of those days  must have admonished in all sincerity her child not to do this or that  lest God strike the sudden blow of death in retribution. Numerous indeed  are the examples presented of sinners who paid thus abruptly the penalty  for transgression. Let Increase Mather speak through his _Essay for the  Recording of Illustrious Providences_:    \"The hand of God was very remarkable in that which came to pass in the  Narragansett country in New England, not many weeks since; for I have  good information, that on August 28, 1683, a man there (viz. Samuel  Wilson) having caused his dog to mischief his neighbor's cattle was  blamed for his so doing. He denied the fact with imprecations, wishing  that he might never stir from that place if he had so done. His neighbor  being troubled at his denying the truth, reproved him, and told him he  did very ill to deny what his conscience knew to be truth. The atheist  thereupon used the name of God in his imprecations, saying, 'He wished  to God he might never stir out of that place, if he had done that which  he was charged with.' The words were scarce out of his mouth before he  sunk down dead, and never stirred more; a son-in-law of his standing by  and catching him as he fell to the ground.\"    And if further proof of the swiftness with which God may act is desired,  Increase Mather's _Illustrious Providences_ may again be cited: \"A thing  not unlike this happened (though not in New England yet) in America,  about a year ago; for in September, 1682, a man at the Isle of  Providence, belonging to a vessel, whereof one Wollery was master, being  charged with some deceit in a matter that had been committed to him, in  order to his own vindication, horridly wished 'that the devil might put  out his eyes if he had done as was suspected concerning him.' That very  night a rheum fell into his eyes so that within a few days he became  stark blind. His company being astonished at the Divine hand which thus  conspicuously and signally appeared, put him ashore at Providence, and  left him there. A physician being desired to undertake his cure, hearing  how he came to lose his sight, refused to meddle with him. This account  I lately received from credible persons, who knew and have often seen  the man whom the devil (according to his own wicked wish) made blind,  through the dreadful and righteous judgment of God.\"      _III. Inherited Nervousness_    In all ages it would seem that woman has more readily accepted the  teachings of her elders and has taken to heart more earnestly the  doctrines of new religions, however strange or novel, than has man. It  was so in the days of Christ; it is true in our own era of Christian  Science, Theosophy, and New Thought. The message that fell from the lips  of the fanatically zealous preachers of colonial times sank deep into  the hearts of New England women. Its impression was sharp and abiding,  and the sensitive mother transmitted her fears and dread to her child.  Timid girls, inheriting a super-conscious realization of human defects,  and hearing from babyhood the terrifying doctrines, grew also into a  womanhood noticeable for overwrought nerves and depressed spirits.  Timid, shrinking Betty Sewall, daughter of Judge Sewall, was troubled  all the days of her life with qualms about the state of her soul, was  hysterical as a child, wretched in her mature years, and depressed in  soul at the hour of her departure. In his famous diary her father makes  this note about her when she was about five years of age: \"It falls to  my daughter Elizabeth's Share to read the 24 of Isaiah which she doth  with many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#6)"],[1,"in shape like a top-hat, which, however, was made of  transparent glass. The scene at once brought to my mind the proverb: \"He  who keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land.\" By a  slight turn the _glass hat_ reminded me of _Auer's light_, and I knew  that I was about to invent something which was to make me as rich and  independent as his invention had made my countryman, Dr. Auer, of  Welsbach; then I should be able to travel instead of remaining in  Vienna. In the dream I was traveling with my invention, with the, it is  true, rather awkward glass top-hat. The dream work is peculiarly adept  at representing two contradictory conceptions by means of the same mixed  image. Thus, for instance, a woman dreamt of herself carrying a tall  flower-stalk, as in the picture of the Annunciation (Chastity-Mary is  her own name), but the stalk was bedecked with thick white blossoms  resembling camellias (contrast with chastity: La dame aux Camelias).    A great deal of what we have called \"dream condensation\" can be thus  formulated. Each one of the elements of the dream content is  _overdetermined_ by the matter of the dream thoughts; it is not derived  from one element of these thoughts, but from a whole series. These are  not necessarily interconnected in any way, but may belong to the most  diverse spheres of thought. The dream element truly represents all this  disparate matter in the dream content. Analysis, moreover, discloses  another side of the relationship between dream content and dream  thoughts. Just as one element of the dream leads to associations with  several dream thoughts, so, as a rule, the _one dream thought represents  more than one dream element_. The threads of the association do not  simply converge from the dream thoughts to the dream content, but on the  way they overlap and interweave in every way.    Next to the transformation of one thought in the scene (its  \"dramatization\"), condensation is the most important and most  characteristic feature of the dream work. We have as yet no clue as to  the motive calling for such compression of the content.    In the complicated and intricate dreams with which we are now concerned,  condensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the difference  between dream contents and dream thoughts. There is evidence of a third  factor, which deserves careful consideration.    When I have arrived at an understanding of the dream thoughts by my  analysis I notice, above all, that the matter of the manifest is very  different from that of the latent dream content. That is, I admit, only  an apparent difference which vanishes on closer investigation, for in  the end I find the whole dream content carried out in the dream  thoughts, nearly all the dream thoughts again represented in the dream  content. Nevertheless, there does remain a certain amount of difference.    The essential content which stood out clearly and broadly in the dream  must, after analysis, rest satisfied with a very subordinate role among  the dream thoughts. These very dream thoughts which, going by my  feelings, have a claim to the greatest importance are either not present  at all in the dream content, or are represented by some remote allusion  in some obscure region of the dream. I can thus describe these  phenomena: _During the dream work the psychical intensity of those  thoughts and conceptions to which it properly pertains flows to others  which, in my judgment, have no claim to such emphasis_. There is no  other process which contributes so much to concealment of the dream's  meaning and to make the connection between the dream content and dream  ideas irrecognizable. During this process, which I will call _the dream  displacement_, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, or  emotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness.  What was clearest in the dream seems to me, without further  consideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element of  the dream I can recognize the most direct offspring of the principal  dream thought.    I could only designate this dream displacement as the _transvaluation of  psychical values_. The phenomena will not have been considered in all  its bearings unless I add that this displacement or transvaluation is  shared by different dreams in extremely varying degrees. There are  dreams which take place almost without any displacement. These have the  same time, meaning, and intelligibility as we found in the dreams which  recorded a desire. In other dreams not a bit of the dream idea has  retained its own psychical value, or everything essential in these dream  ideas has been replaced by unessentials, whilst every kind of transition  between these conditions can be found. The more obscure and intricate a  dream is, the greater is the part to be ascribed to the impetus of  displacement in its formation.    The example that we chose for analysis shows, at least, this much of  displacement--that its content has a different center of interest from  that of the dream ideas. In the forefront of the dream content the main  scene appears as if a woman wished to make advances to me; in the dream  idea the chief interest rests on the desire to enjoy disinterested love  which shall \"cost nothing\"; this idea lies at the back of the talk about  the beautiful eyes and the far-fetched allusion to \"spinach.\"    If we abolish the dream displacement, we attain through analysis quite  certain conclusions regarding two problems of the dream which are most  disputed--as to what provokes a dream at all, and as to the connection  of the dream with our waking life. There are dreams which at once expose  their links with the events of the day; in others no trace of such a  connection can be found. By the aid of analysis it can be shown that  every dream, without any exception, is linked up with our impression of  the day, or perhaps it would be more correct to say of the day previous  to the dream. The impressions which have incited the dream may be so  important that we are not surprised at our being occupied with them  whilst awake; in this case we are right in saying that the dream carries  on the chief interest of our waking life. More usually, however, when  the dream contains anything relating to the impressions of the day, it  is so trivial, unimportant, and so deserving of oblivion, that we can  only recall it with an effort. The dream content appears, then, even  when coherent and intelligible, to be concerned with those indifferent  trifles of thought undeserving of our waking interest. The depreciation  of dreams is largely due to the predominance of the indifferent and the  worthless in their content.    Analysis destroys the appearance upon which this derogatory judgment is  based. When the dream content discloses nothing but some indifferent  impression as instigating the dream, analysis ever indicates some  significant event, which has been replaced by something indifferent  with which it has entered into abundant associations. Where the dream is  concerned with uninteresting and unimportant conceptions, analysis  reveals the numerous associative paths which connect the trivial with  the momentous in the psychical estimation of the individual. _It is only  the action of displacement if what is indifferent obtains recognition in  the dream content instead of those impressions which are really the  stimulus, or instead of the things of real interest_. In answering the  question as to what provokes the dream, as to the connection of the  dream, in the daily troubles, we must say, in terms of the insight given  us by replacing the manifest latent dream content: _The dream does never  trouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concern  during the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the day  have no power to pursue us whilst asleep_.    What provoked the dream in the example which we have analyzed? The  really unimportant event, that a friend invited me to a _free ride in  his cab_. The table d'hote scene in the dream contains an allusion to  this indifferent motive, for in conversation I had brought the taxi  parallel with the table d'hote. But I can indicate the important event  which has as its substitute the trivial one. A few days before I had  disbursed a large sum of money for a member of my family who is very  dear to me. Small wonder, says the dream thought, if this person is  grateful to me for this--this love is not cost-free. But love that shall  cost nothing is one of the prime thoughts of the dream. The fact that  shortly before this I had had several _drives_ with the relative in  question puts the one drive with my friend in a position to recall the  connection with the other person. The indifferent impression which, by  such ramifications, provokes the dream is subservient to another  condition which is not true of the real source of the dream--the  impression must be a recent one, everything arising from the day of the  dream.    I cannot leave the question of dream displacement without the  consideration of a remarkable process in the formation of dreams in  which condensation and displacement work together towards one end. In  condensation we have already considered the case where two conceptions  in the dream having something in common, some point of contact, are  replaced in the dream content by a mixed image, where the distinct germ  corresponds to what is common, and the indistinct secondary  modifications to what is distinctive. If displacement is added to  condensation, there is no formation of a mixed image, but a _common  mean_ which bears the same relationship to the individual elements as  does the resultant in the parallelogram of forces to its components. In  one of my dreams, for instance, there is talk of an injection with  _propyl_. On first analysis I discovered an indifferent but true  incident where _amyl_ played a"]]]
