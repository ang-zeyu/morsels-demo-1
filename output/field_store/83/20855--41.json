First, the toilworn Craftsman that  with earth-made Implement laboriously conquers the Earth, and makes  her man's. . . . A second man I honour, and still more highly: Him  who is seen toiling for the spiritually indispensable; not daily  bread, but the Bread of Life. . . . Unspeakably touching is it,  however, when I find both dignities united; and he that must toil  outwardly for the lowest of man's wants, is also toiling inwardly  for the highest.\"[4]    [Footnote 4: Carlyle, _Sartor Resartus_.]    To understand the many and bewildering changes which followed one  another in rapid succession during the early years of Victoria's  reign it is necessary to read the literature, more especially the  works of those writers who took a deep and lasting interest in the  lives and work of the people.    Democracy, the people, or the toiling class, was engaged in a fierce  battle with those forces which it held to be its natural enemies.  It was a battle of the Rich against the Poor, of the masters against  the men, of Right against Might. England was a sick nation, at war  with itself, and Chartism and the Chartists were some of the signs  of the disease. The early Victorian age is the age of Thomas Carlyle,  the stern, grim prophet, who, undaunted by poverty and ill-health,  painted England in dark colours as a country hastening to its ruin.    His message was old and yet new--for men had forgotten it, as they  always have from age to age. This was an age of competition, of  'supply and demand'; brotherly love had been forgotten and 'cash  payment' had taken its place. Carlyle denounced this system as \"the  shabbiest gospel that had been taught among men.\" He urged upon  Government the fact that it was their _duty_ to educate and to uplift  the masses, and upon the masters that they should look upon their  workers as something more than money-making machines. The old system  of Guilds, in which the apprentice was under the master's direct care,  had gone and nothing had been put in its place.    The value of Carlyle's teaching lies in the fact that he insisted  upon the sanctity of work. \"All true work is religion,\" he said, and  the essence of every true religion is to be found in the words, \"Know  thy work and do it.\"    The best test of the worth of every nation is to be found in their  standard of life and work and their rejection of a life of idleness.  \"To make some nook of God's Creation a little fruitfuller, better,  more worthy of God; to make some human hearts, a little wiser,  manfuler, happier--more blessed, less accursed! It is work for a  God. . . . Unstained by wasteful deformities, by wasted tears or  heart's-blood of men, or any defacement of the Pit, noble, fruitful  Labour, growing ever nobler, will come forth--the grand sole Miracle  of Man, whereby Man has risen from the low places of this Earth, very  literally, into divine Heavens. Ploughers, Spinners, Builders,  Prophets, Poets, Kings: . . . all martyrs, and noble men, and gods  are of one grand Host; immeasurable; marching ever forward since the  beginnings of the World.\"[5]    [Footnote 5: Carlyle, _Past and Present_.]    Carlyle was, above all things, sincere; he looked into the heart of  things, and hated half-beliefs. Men, he said, were accustoming  themselves to say what they did not believe in their heart of hearts.  The standard of English work had become lower; it was 'cheap and  nasty,' and this in itself was a moral evil. Good must in time prevail  over Evil; the Christian religion was the strongest thing in the  world, and for this reason had conquered. He believed in wise  compassion--that is to say, he kept his sympathy for those who truly  deserved it, for the mass of struggling workers with few or none to  voice their bitter wrongs.    His teachings are a moral tonic for the age, and though for a long  time they were unpopular and distasteful to the majority, yet he  lived to see much accomplished for which he had so earnestly striven.    Literature was beginning to take a new form. The novel of 'polite'  society was giving place to the novel which pictured life in cruder  and harsher colours. The life of the toiling North, of the cotton  spinners and weavers was as yet unknown to most people.    In 1848 appeared _Mary Barton_, a book dealing with the problems of  working life in Manchester. Mrs Gaskell, its author, who is best  known to most readers by her masterpiece _Cranford_, achieved an  instant success and became acquainted with many literary celebrities,  including Ruskin, Dickens, and Charlotte Bronte, whose Life she  wrote.    _Mary Barton_ was written from the point of view of labour, and _North  and South_, which followed some years later, from that of capital.  Her books are exact pictures of what she saw around her during her  life in Manchester, and many incidents from her own life appear in  their pages.    _North and South_ shows us the struggle not only between master and  men, as representing capital and labour, but also between ancient  and modern civilizations. The South is agricultural, easy-going,  idyllic; the North is stern, rude, and full of a consuming energy  and passion for work. These are the two Englands of Mrs Gaskell's  time.    The ways of the manufacturing districts, which seem unpleasing to  those who do not really know them, are described with a faithful yet  kindly pen, and we see that each life has its trials and its  temptations.    In the South all is not sunshine, and the life of the labourer can  be very hard--\"a young person can stand it; but an old man gets racked  with rheumatism, and bent and withered before his time; yet he must  work on the same, or else go to the workhouse.\"    In the North men are often at enmity with their masters, and fight  them by means of the strike. \"State o' trade! That's just a piece  of masters' humbug. It's rate o' wages I was talking of. Th' masters  keep th' state o' trade in their own hands, and just walk it forward  like a black bug-a-boo, to frighten naughty children with into being  good. I'll tell yo' it's their part--their cue, as some folks call  it--to beat us down, to swell their fortunes; and it's ours to stand  up and fight hard--not for ourselves alone, but for them round about  us--for justice and fair play. We help to make their profits, and  we ought to help spend 'em. It's not that we want their brass so much  this time, as we've done many a time afore. We'n getten money laid  by; and we're resolved to stand and fall together; not a man on us  will go in for less wage than th' Union says is our due. So I say,  'Hooray for the strike.'\"    The story appeared in _Household Words_, a new magazine of which  Charles Dickens was the editor. He expressed especial admiration for  the fairness with which Mrs Gaskell had spoken of both sides.  Nicholas Higgins, whose words are quoted above, is a type of the best  Lancashire workman, who holds out for the good of the cause, even  though it might mean ruin and poverty to himself--\"That's what folk  call fine and honourable in a soldier, and why not in a poor  weaver-chap?\"    Dickens himself wrote _Hard Times_, dealing with the same subject.  This appeared about the same time, and the two books should be read  and compared, for, although _Hard Times_ is not equal in any way to  _North and South_, it is interesting. As Ruskin said of Dickens'  stories, \"Allowing for the manner of telling them, the things he  tells us are always true. . . . He is entirely right in his main drift  and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but  especially _Hard Times_, should be studied with close and earnest  care by persons interested in social questions.\"    During all these years the 'Chartists' had been vainly struggling  to force Parliament to proceed with reform of their grievances. In  1848 a monster Petition was to be presented to both Houses by their  leaders, but London was garrisoned by troops under the Duke of  Wellington on the fateful day, and the Chartist army broke"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#6)"],[1,"is first employed  in stretching the lines, which thus receive the energy required to  permit them, in shortening, to cut the conductor and set up currents  in the electric circuit in accordance with the potential difference  developed in that circuit and its resistance.    I think we may also say, though I do not remember to have seen the  statement so put, that whenever electric potential is set up  inductively, as in self-induction, mutual induction, induction from  one circuit to another, and induction from magnets or magnetic field,  it is set up by the movement of lines of force laterally across the  body, mass or conductor in which the potential is developed, and that  whenever current is set up in a wire or an existing current prolonged,  or an existing current checked by induction, self-induction, or  induction from magnets, the action is a transfer of energy,  represented by strained lines of force shortening or lessening their  resistance, or lengthening and increasing the resistance in their  paths. The magnetic field is like an elastic spring--it can in one  condition represent stored energy--it can be strained and will store  energy--it can be made to relieve its strain and impart energy.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    Let us examine some known phenomena in this light. Take the case of a  simple wire, conveying current, say, in a line away from observer,  Fig. 1. There exists a free field of circular magnetism (so called),  shading off away from the wire, and which is represented by concentric  circles of increased diameter. The superior intensity or strength of  the lines near the wire may also be represented by their thickness.  This is often shown also by crowding the lines near the wire, though I  am disposed to regard Fig. 1 as more nearly expressing the condition,  unless we are to regard the lines as simply indicating a sort of  atmosphere of magnetic effect whose density becomes less as we proceed  outward from the wire, in which case either form of symbol suffices.  The direction of polarization of the lines may be indicated by an  arrow head pointing in a direction of right-handed rotation in the  path of the lines. This is the typical figure or expression for all  forms of simple magnetic circuit--the form of the lines, their length,  position, density, will depend on the shape of the conductor or  conductors (when more than one) and the materials surrounding or in  proximity to the wire or wires.    If the current traversing the conductor is constant, the magnetic  field around it is stable and static, unless other influences come in  to modify it. The cutting off of the current is followed by  instability of the field whereby it can and must produce dynamic  effects. I say _must_ because the field represents stored energy, and  in disappearing _must_ give out that energy. To throw light on this  part of the subject is one of the objects of the present paper.  Cutting off the current supply in the case assumed leaves the  developed magnetic lines or strains unsupported. They at once shorten  their paths or circuits, collapsing upon the conductor as it were, and  continuing this action, cut the section of the conductor, and  apparently disappear in magnetic closed circuits of infinitesimal  diameter but of great strength of polarization. It appears to me that  we must either be prepared to give up the idea of lines of force or  take the position that the magnetic circuits precipitate themselves in  shortening their circuits and disappearing upon and cut the conductor.  It was Hughes who put forward the idea that an iron bar in losing its  apparent magnetism really short-circuits the lines in itself as  innumerable strongly magnetized closed circuits among the molecules.  In becoming magnetic once more these short circuits are opened or  extended into the air by some source of energy applied to strain the  lines, such as a current in a conductor around the bar.    May not this idea be extended, then, to include the magnetic medium,  the ether itself? Does it contain intensely polarized closed circuits  of magnetism which are ready to be stretched or extended under certain  conditions by the application of energy, which energy is returned by  the collapse of the extended circuits? This is doubtless but a crude  expression of the real condition of things, for the lines are only  symbols for a condition of strain in a medium which cannot be  represented in thought, as we know nothing of its real nature. There  is one point in this connection which I must emphasize. The strained  lines, Fig. 1, are indications of stored energy in the ether, and the  lines _cannot_ disappear without giving out that energy. Ordinarily,  it makes its appearance as the extra current, and adds itself so as to  prolong the current which extended the lines when an attempt is made  to cut off such current. Were it conceivable that the current could be  cut off and the wire put on open circuit while the lines still  remained open or strained, the energy must still escape when the field  disappears. It would then produce such a high potential as to be able  to discharge from the ends of the conductor, and if the conductor were  of some section, part of the energy would be expended in setting up  local currents in it. The field could not disappear without an outlet  for the energy it represents. But we cannot cut off a current in a  wire so as to leave the wire on open circuit with the lines of the  magnetic circuit remaining around it without iron or steel or the like  in the magnetic circuit. We can approach that condition, however, by  breaking the circuit very quickly with a condenser of limited capacity  around the break. This is done in the Ruhmkorff coil primary; the  condenser forms a sort of blind alley for the extra current on its  beginning to flow out of the primary coil. But the condenser charges  and backs up and stops the discharge from the primary, even giving a  reverse current. The lines of magnetic force collapse, however, and  have their effect in the enormous potential set up in the secondary  coil.    Take away the secondary coil so as to stop that outlet, the energy  expends itself on the iron core and the primary coil. Take away the  iron core, and the energy of magnetization of the air or ether core  expends itself on the wire of the primary and, possibly, also on the  dielectric of the condenser to some extent. The extra current becomes  in this instance an oscillatory discharge of very high period back and  forth through the primary coil from the condenser, until the energy is  lost in the heat of C2 x R. This conversion is doubtless rendered  all the more rapid by uneven distribution of current and eddy current  set up in the wire of the coil.    The considerations just given concern the loss of field or the  shortening and apparent disappearance of the magnetic lines or  circuits, as giving rise to the self-induction or increased potential  on breaking. Where the energizing current is slowly cut off or  diminished the energy is gradually transferred to the wire in  producing elevation of potential during the decrease; and the collapse  and cutting of the wire by the collapsing circuits or lines is then  only more gradual.    Let the current be returned to the wire after disappearance of  magnetism, and the lines again seem to emanate from the wire and at  the same time cut it and produce a counter potential in it, which is  the index of the abstraction of energy from the circuit, and its  storing up in the form of elastically strained lines of magnetism  around the conductor. The effect is that of self-induction on making  or upon increase of current, the measure of the amount being the  energy stored in the magnetic circuits which have been extended or  opened up by the current. The greater the current and the shorter the  path for the lines developed around the axis of the conductor, the  greater the energy stored up. Hence, a circular section conductor has  the highest self-induction, a tube of same section less as its  diameter increases, a flat strip has less as its width increases and  thickness diminishes, a divided conductor much less than a single  conductor of same shape and section. Separating the strands of a  divided conductor increases the length of magnetic paths around it,  and so diminishes the self-induction. A striking instance of this  latter fact was developed in conveying very heavy alternating currents  of a very low potential a distance of about three feet by copper  conductors, the current being used in electric welding operations.    The conductors were built up of flat thin strips of copper for  flexibility. When the strips were allowed to lie closely together, the  short conductor showed an enormous self-induction, which cut down the  effective potential at its ends near the work. By spreading apart the  strips so as to lengthen a line around the conductor, the  self-induction could be easily made less than 35 per cent. of what it  had been before. The interweaving of the outgoing and return conductor  strands as one compound conductor gets rid almost entirely of the  self-inductive effects, because neither conductor has any free space  in which to develop strong magnetic forces, but is opposed in effect  everywhere by the opposite current in its neighbor.    Where a number of conductors are parallel, and have the same direction  of current, as in a coil or in a strand, it is evident that statically  the conductor may be considered as replaceable by a single conductor  with the same external dimensions and same total current in the area  occupied, the magnetic forces or lines surrounding them being of same  intensity. But with changing current strength the distribution of  current in the conductor has also a powerful effect on the energy  absorbed or given out in accordance with the magnetism produced. Hence  the self-induction of a strand, coil or"]]]
