The saxophone is  played like the clarinet with the intervention of a beating reed, but  is not cylindrical; it has a conical tube like the oboe. The different  shape of the column of air changes the first available harmonic  obtained by overblowing to the octave instead of the twelfth; and also  in consequence of the greater strength of the even harmonics,  distinctly changing the tone quality. The sarrusophone may fairly be  regarded as an oboe or bassoon; but the saxophone is not so closely  related to the clarinet. There are four sizes of saxophone now made  between high soprano and bass. Starting from the fourth fundamental  note, each key can be employed in the next higher octave, by the help  of other two keys, which, being opened successively, set up a  vibrating loop. The saxophones, although difficult to play, fill an  important place in the military music of France and Belgium, and have  been employed with advantage in the French orchestra. The fingering of  all saxophones is that attributed to Boehm.    The cup shaped mouthpiece must now take the place of the reed in our  attention. Here the lips fit against a hollow cup shaped reservoir,  and, acting as vibrating membranes, may be compared with the vocal  chords of the larynx. They have been described as acting as true  reeds. Each instrument in which such a mouthpiece is employed requires  a slightly different form of it. The French horn is the most important  brass instrument in modern music. It consists of a body of conical  shape about seven feet long, without the crooks, ending in a large  bell, which spreads out to a diameter of fifteen inches. The crooks  are fitted between the body and the mouthpiece; they are a series of  smaller interchangeable tubings, which extend in length as they  descend in pitch, and set the instrument in different keys. The  mouthpiece is a funnel shaped tube of metal, by preference silver;  and, in the horn, is exceptionally not cup shaped, but the reverse: it  tapers, as a cone, from three-quarters of an inch diameter to about a  minimum of three-sixteenths of an inch, and is a quarter of an inch  where the smaller end of the mouthpiece is inserted in the upper  opening of the crook. The first horn has a mouthpiece of rather less  diameter than the second. The peculiar mouthpiece and narrow tubing  have very much to do with the soft voice-like tone quality of the  horn. For convenience of holding, the tubing is bent in a spiral form.  There is a tuning slide attached to the body, and, of late years,  valves have been added to the horn, similar to those applied to the  cornet and other wind instruments. They have, to a considerable  extent, superseded hand stopping, by which expedient the intonation  could be altered a semitone or whole tone, by depression of the  natural notes of the instrument. In brass, or other instruments, the  natural harmonics depend on the pressure of blowing; and the brass  differs entirely from the wood wind, in this respect, that it is rare,  or with poor effect, the lowest or fundamental note can be made to  sound. Stopping the horn is done by extending the open hand some way  up the bore; there is half stopping and whole stopping, according to  the interval, the half tone or whole tone required. As may be  imagined, the stopped notes are weak and dull compared with the open.  On the other hand, the tubing introduced for valves not being quite  conformable in curve with the instrument, and hampered with  indispensable joins, unless in the best form of modern valve, affects  the smoothness of tone. No doubt there has been of late years a great  improvement in the manufacture of valves. Many horns are still made  with crooks covering an octave from B flat to B flat, 8 feet 6 inches  to 17 feet; but most players now use only the F crook, and trust to  the valves, rather than to change the crooks, so that we lose the  fullness of sound of those below F. The natural horn was originally in  D, but was not always restricted to that key; there have been horns  for F, G, high A, and B flat. This may, however, be said for the valve  horn, that it does not limit or restrict composers in writing for the  open or natural notes, which are always more beautiful in effect.    Valves were invented and first introduced in Prussia about A.D. 1815.  At first there were two, but there are now generally three. In this  country and France they are worked by pistons, which, when pressed  down, give access for the air into channels or supplementary tubings  on one side of the main bore, thus lengthening it by a tone for the  first valve, a semitone for the second, and a tone and a semitone for  the third. When released by the finger, the piston returns by the  action of a spring. In large bass and contralto instruments, a fourth  piston is added, which lowers the pitch two tones and a semitone. By  combining the use of three valves, lower notes are obtained--thus, for  a major third, the second is depressed with the third; for a fourth,  the first and third; and for the tritone, the first, second, and  third. But the intonation becomes imperfect when valves are used  together, because the lengths of additional tubing being calculated  for the single depressions, when added to each other, they are too  short for the deeper notes required. By an ingenious invention of  compensating pistons, Mr. Blaikley, of Messrs. Boosey's, has  practically rectified this error without extra moving parts or altered  fingering. In the valve section, each altered note becomes a  fundamental for another harmonic scale. In Germany a rotary valve, a  kind of stop cock, is preferred to the piston. It is said to give  greater freedom of execution, the closeness of the shake being its  best point, but is more expensive and liable to derangement. The  invention of M. Adolphe Sax, of a single ascending piston in place of  a group of descending ones, by which the tube is shortened instead of  lengthened, met, for a time, with influential support. It is suitable  for both conical and cylindrical instruments, and has six valves,  which are always used independently. However, practical difficulties  have interfered with its success. With any valve system, however, a  difficulty with the French horn is its great variation in length by  crooks, inimical to the principle of the valve system, which relies  upon an adjustment by aliquot parts. It will, however, be seen that  the invention of valves has, by transforming and extending wind  instruments, so as to become chromatic, given many advantages to the  composer. Yet it must, at the same time, be conceded, in spite of the  increasing favor shown for valve instruments, that the tone must issue  more freely, and with more purity and beauty, from a simple tube than  from tubes with joinings and other complications, that interfere with  the regularity and smoothness of vibration, and, by mechanical  facilities, tend to promote a dull uniformity of tone quality.    Owing to the changes of pitch by crooks, it is not easy to define the  compass of the French horn. Between C in the bass clef and G above the  treble will represent its serviceable notes. It is better that the  first horn should not descend below middle C, or the second rise above  the higher E of the treble clef. Four are generally used in modern  scores. The place of the horn is with the wood wind band. From Handel,  every composer has written for it, and what is known as the small  orchestra of string and wood wind bands combined is completed by this  beautiful instrument.    The most prominent instruments that add to the splendor of the full  orchestra are trumpets and trombones. They are really members of one  family, as the name trombone--big trumpet--implies, and blend well  together. The trumpet is an instrument of court and state functions,  and, as the soprano instrument, comes first. It is what is known as an  eight foot instrument in pitch, and gives the different harmonics from  the third to the twelfth, and even to the sixteenth. It is made of  brass, mixed metal, or silver, and is about five feet seven inches in  real length, when intended for the key of F without a slide; but is  twice turned back upon itself, the first and third lengths lying  contiguous, and the second about two inches from them. The diameter is  three-eighths of an inch along the cylindrical length; it then widens  out for about fifteen inches, to form the bell.    When fitted with a slide for transposition--an invention for the  trumpet in the last century--this double tubing, about five inches in  length on each side, is connected with the second length. It is worked  from the center with the second and third fingers of the right band,  and, when pulled back, returns to its original position by a spring.  There are five crooks. The mouthpiece is hemispherical and convex, and  the exact shape of it is of great importance. It has a rim with  slightly rounded surface. The diameter of the mouthpiece varies  according to the player and the pitch required. With the first crook,  or rather shank, and mouthpiece, the length of the trumpet is  increased to six feet, and the instrument is then in the key of F. The  second shank transposes it to E, the third to E flat, and the fourth  to D. The fifth, and largest--two feet one and a half inches  long--extends the instrument to eight feet, and lowers the key to C.  The slide is used for transposition by a semitone or a whole tone,  thus making new fundamentals, and correcting certain notes of the  natural harmonic scale, as the seventh, eleventh, and thirteenth,  which do not agree with our musical scale. Mr. W. Wyatt has recently  taken out a patent for a double-slide trumpet, which possesses a  complete chromatic scale. In the required length of slide the ear has  always to assist. It is clear that the very short shifts of a double  slide demand great "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#6)"],[1,"Boru. Legendary history made no impression  upon Froude. The actual state of Ireland affected him with the  deepest interest. A population of eight millions, fed chiefly upon  potatoes, and multiplying like rabbits, light-hearted, reckless, and  generous, never grudged hospitality, nor troubled themselves about  paying their debts. Their kindness to strangers was unbounded. In  the wilds of Mayo Froude caught the smallpox, and was nursed with a  devotion which he always remembered, ungrateful as in some of his  writings about Ireland he may seem. After his recovery he wandered  about the coast, saw the station of Protestant missionaries at  Achill, and was rowed out to Clare Island, where a disabled galleon  from the Armada had been wrecked. His studies in hagiology led him  to consider the whole question of the miraculous, and he found it  impossible to work with Newman any more. A religion which rested  upon such stories as Father Colgan's was a religion nurtured in  lies.    All this, however, had nothing to do with the Church of England by  law established, and Froude was ordained deacon in 1845. The same  year Newman seceded, and was received into the Church of Rome. No  similar event, before or since, has excited such consternation and  alarm. So impartial an observer as Mr. Disraeli thought that the  Church of England did not in his time recover from the blow. We are  only concerned with it here as it affected Froude. It affected him  in a way unknown outside the family. Hurrell Froude, who abhorred  private judgment as a Protestant error, had told his brothers that  when they saw Newman and Keble disagree they might think for  themselves. He felt sure that he was thereby guarding them against  thinking for themselves at all. But now the event which he  considered impossible had happened. Newman had gone to Rome. Keble  remained faithful to the Church of his baptism. Which side Hurrell  Froude would have taken nobody could say. He had died a clergyman of  the Church of England at the age of thirty-three, nine years before.  Anthony Froude had no inclination to follow Newman. But neither did  he agree with Keble. He thought for himself. Of his brief clerical  career there exists a singular record in the shape of a funeral  sermon preached at St. Mary's Church, Torquay, on the second Sunday  after Trinity, 1847. The subject was George May Coleridge, vicar of  the parish, the poet's nephew, who had been cut off in the prime of  life while Froude acted as his curate. The sermon itself is not  remarkable, except for being written in unusually good English. The  doctrine is strictly orthodox, and the simple life of a good clergyman  devoted to his people is described with much tenderness of feeling.    This sermon, of which he gave a copy to John Duke Coleridge, the  future Lord Chief Justice of England, was Froude's first experiment  in authorship, and it was at least harmless. As much cannot be said  for the second, two anonymous stories, called Shadows of the Clouds  and The Lieutenant's Daughter. The Lieutenant's Daughter has been  long and deservedly forgotten. Shadows of the Clouds is a valuable  piece of autobiography. Without literary merit, without any quality  to attract the public, it gives a vivid and faithful account of the  author's troubles at school and at home, together with a slight  sketch of his unfortunate love-affair.    Froude was a born story-teller, with an irresistible propensity for  making books. The fascination which, throughout his life, he had for  women showed itself almost before he was out of his teens; and in  this case the feeling was abundantly returned. Nevertheless he  could, within a few years, publish the whole narrative, changing  only the names, and then feel genuine surprise that the other person  concerned should be pained. He was not inconsiderate. Those who  lived with him never heard from him a rough or unkind word. But his  dramatic instinct was uncontrollable and had to be expressed. The  Archdeacon read the book, and was naturally furious. If he could  have been in any way convinced of his errors, which may be doubted,  to publish an account of them was not the best way to begin.  Reconciliation had been made impossible, and Anthony was left to his  own devices. His miscellaneous reading was not checked by an  ordination which imposed no duties. Goethe sent him to Spinoza, a  \"God-intoxicated man,\" and a philosophical genius, but not a pillar  of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. Vestiges of Creation, which had  appeared in 1844, woke Oxford to the discovery that physical science  might have something to say about the origin, or at least the  growth, of the universe. The writer, Robert Chambers, whose name was  not then known, so far anticipated Darwin that he dispensed with the  necessity for a special creation of each plant and animal. He did  not, any more than Darwin, attack the Christian religion, and he did  not really go much farther than Lucretius. But he had more modern  lights, he understood science, and he wrote in a popular style. He  made a lively impression upon Froude, who learnt from him that  natural phenomena were due to natural causes, at the same time that  he acquired from Spinoza a disbelief in the freedom of the will.  When Dr. Johnson said, \"Sir, we know that the will is free, and  there's an end on't,\" he did not understand the question. We all  know that the will is free to act. But is man free to will? If  everything about a man were within our cognisance, we could predict  his conduct in given circumstances as certainly as a chemist can  foretell the effect of mixing an acid with an alkali. I have no  intention of expressing any opinion of my own upon this subject. The  important thing is that Froude became in the philosophic sense a  Determinist, and his conviction that Calvin was in that respect the  best philosopher among theologians strengthened his attachment to  the Protestant cause.    Protestantism apart, however, Froude's position as a clergyman had  become intolerable. He had been persuaded to accept ordination for  the reason, among others, that the Church could be reformed better  from within than from without.    But there were few doctrines of the Church that he could honestly  teach, and the straightforward course was to abandon the clerical  profession. Nowadays a man in Froude's plight would only have to  sign a paper, and he would be free. But before 1870 orders, even  deacon's orders, were indelible. Neither a priest nor a deacon could  sit in Parliament, or enter any other learned profession. Froude was  in great difficulty and distress. He consulted his friends Arthur  Stanley, Matthew Arnold, and Arthur Clough. Clough, though a layman,  felt the same perplexity as himself. As a Fellow and Tutor of Oriel  he had signed the Articles. Now that he no longer believed in them,  ought he not to live up his appointments? The Provost, Dr. Hawkins,  induced him to pause and reflect. Meanwhile he published a volume of  poetry, including the celebrated Bothie, about which Froude wrote to  him:    \"I was for ever falling upon lines which gave me uneasy twitchings;  e.g. the end of the love scene:    \"And he fell at her feet, and buried his face in her apron.    \"I daresay the head would fall there, but what an image! It chimes  in with your notion of the attractiveness of the working business.  But our undisciplined ears have divided the ideas too long to bear  to have them so abruptly shaken together. Love is an idle sort of a  god, and comes in other hours than the working ones; at least I have  always found it so. I don't think of it in my working time, and when  I see a person I do love working (at whatever it may be), I have  quite another set of thoughts about her. . . It would do excellently  well for married affection, for it is the element in which it lives.  But I don't think young love gets born then. I only speak for  myself, and from a very limited experience. As to the story, I don't  the least object to it on The Spectator's ground. I think it could  not have been done in prose. Verse was wanted to give it dignity.  But if we find it trivial, the fault is in our own varnished selves.  We have been polished up so bright that we forget the stuff we are  made of.\"    Clough was in politics a Republican, and sympathised ardently with  the French Revolution of 1848. So did Charles Kingsley, a Cambridge  man, who was at that time on a visit to Exeter. But Kingsley, though  a disciple of Carlyle, was also a hard-working clergyman, who held  that the masses could be regenerated by Christian Socialism. Froude  had no faith in Socialism, nor in Christianity as the Church  understood it. In this year, 1848, Emerson also came to Oxford, and  dined with Clough at Oriel, where they thought him like Newman.  Froude was already an admirer of Emerson's essays, and laid his case  before the American moralist. Emerson gave him, as might have been  expected, no practical advice, but recommended him to read the  Vedas. Nothing mattered much to Emerson, who took the opportunity to  give a lecture in London on the Spiritual Unity of all Animated  Beings. Froude attended it, and there first saw Carlyle, who burst,  characteristically enough, into a shout of laughter at the close.  Carlyle loved Emerson; but the Emersonian philosophy was to him like  any other form of old clothes, only rather more grotesque than most.    In the Long Vacation of 1848 Froude went alone to Ireland for the  third time, and shut himself up at Killarney. From Killarney he  wrote a long account of himself to Clough:    \"KILLARNEY, July 15, 1848.    \"I came over here where for the present I am all day in the woods  and on the lake and retire at night into an unpleasant hotel, where  I am sitting up writing this and waiting with the rest of the  household rather anxiously for the arrival of a fresh wedded pair.  Next week I move off across the lake to a sort"]]]
