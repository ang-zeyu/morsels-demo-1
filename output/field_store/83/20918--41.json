This must occur very  soon after coitus, since in those individuals taken in this condition no  definite evidence of the beginning of development of embryos could be  detected by examination.    The length of the gestation period of _spectabilis_ is unknown. The  young are born naked, a fact inferred by failure to find any fetus  showing noticeable hair development, and from the conditions observed in  such young as have been seen. A suckling female was taken by Vorhies,  January 31, 1920, and her den immediately excavated in the hope of  securing the young. Two juveniles were found in a special nest chamber  (see p. 30). These were estimated to be perhaps two weeks old. A serious  effort was made to raise the little animals by feeding milk with a  pipette and keeping them warm with a hot water bottle, but they survived  only 10 days, without the eyes having opened. The uneven temperature as  well as the character of the food was probably responsible for their  deaths. On February 3 they were measured and weighed, with the following  results:    ---------------------------------------------------           |         | Measurements (in millimetres).           | Weight  |-------------------------------           | (in     | Total   | Tail       | Hind           | grams). | length. | vertebrae. | foot.  ---------|---------|---------|------------|--------  No. 1    | 13.3    |   90    |     38     |  24  No. 2    | 12.6    |   93    |     38     |  24  ---------------------------------------------------    At this stage the young were partially clothed with a coat of fine  velvety fur, more especially on the bodies, the tails being still nearly  naked. The body color was dark plumbeous, just the color of the dark  underfur of the adult, or a shade darker, while the characteristic white  markings of the adult stood out sharply as pinkish-white areas against  the dark background (see Pl. IX, Fig. 2, at p. 32). The proportions were  much as in the adult, except that the tails were relatively much shorter  and the feet relatively longer.    Only one other record of young is at hand, that by Bailey, who secured  the young after capture of a suckling female at Santa Rosa, N. Mex. In  this case the litter contained only one. This was squeaking when found,  but was not large enough to crawl away. Its eyes and ears were closed,  and its soft, naked skin was distinctly marked with the pattern of the  adult, the colors being as given for the other two. This juvenile lived  only a week. Young less than half grown were not trapped or noted in our  poisoning operations outside the dens.    Kangaroo rats, if _spectabilis_ be representative, reproduce at a slow  rate as compared with many other small rodents. We have records of 67  females with embryos or scars showing the number produced, and of the  two litters of young described above. Of the 69 females thus recorded,  15, or 21.7 per cent, had but one offspring each; 52, or 75.3 per cent,  but two each; while only 2 individuals, or 2.9 per cent, had three.  Three young is the maximum litter recorded. This, taken in connection  with the protracted breeding season and lack of sure evidence of the  production of two broods a year, gives a surprisingly low rate of  reproduction, indicating relative freedom from inimical factors.    Our breeding records for _merriami_ are fewer than for _spectabilis_,  but are very similar in every way so far as they go, both as to the time  of year and number of young.          FOOD AND STORAGE.      _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ does not hibernate, so must prepare for  unfavorable seasons by extensive storage of food materials. There are  two seasons of the year, in southeastern Arizona at least, when storage  of food takes place, namely, in spring, during April or May, and in  fall, from September to November, the latter being the more important.  For the periods between, the animal must rely largely on stored  materials. Not infrequently a season of severe drought precludes the  possibility of any storage. The summer and fall of 1918 was such a  season on the Range Reserve (Pl. II, Fig. 2). If food stores are  inadequate at such a time the kangaroo rats must perish in considerable  numbers. Fisher found many deserted mounds in the vicinity of Dos  Cabezos, Ariz., in June, 1894, which may be accounted for in this way.  In 1921 Vorhies found all mounds within 4 or 5 miles of Albuquerque, N.  Mex., deserted by _spectabilis_, resulting probably from overgrazing by  sheep and goats during a succession of dry years. In the arid Southwest  natural selection probably favors the animals with the largest food  stores, and it is not surprising that the storing habit has been  developed to a remarkable degree.    Some stored material is likely to be found at any time of year in any  mound examined, the largest quantity usually in fall and winter, the  smallest in July or August (Table 1, dens 1, 2, 14, and 24). Amounts  found by different observers vary from a few ounces to several quarts or  pecks, and stored materials taken from 22 mounds on the Range Reserve  vary in weight from 5 to 4,127 grams (more than 9 pounds). This is  exceeded by one lot from New Mexico, which totaled 5,750 grams (12.67  pounds). It is fairly evident that in seasons of scanty forage for stock  the appropriation of such quantities of grass seeds and crowns and other  grazing materials by numerous kangaroo rats may appreciably reduce the  carrying capacity of the range. Studies of cheek-pouch contents and food  stores taken from dens show that the natural food of _spectabilis_  consists principally of various seeds and fruits, particularly the seeds  of certain grasses. The study of burrow contents has been especially  illuminating and valuable.    All of the stored material from 22 dens on the Range Reserve and from 2  near Albuquerque, N. Mex., has been saved and analyzed as to species as  carefully as the conditions of storage would permit. Within the mound  the food stored is usually more or less segregated by plant species,  though the stores of material of any one kind may be found in several  places through the mound, and often the material is mixed. In the latter  case the quantities of the various species can only be estimated, but in  the former the species may be kept separate by the use of several bags  for collecting the seeds, and a fairly accurate laboratory weighing can  be made later. Very frequently, the explanation of this separation of  species lies in the different seasons of ripening, but sometimes where  two species are ripe at the same time near the mound, one is worked upon  for a time to the exclusion of the other. The one kind is often packed  in tightly against the other, but with a very abrupt change in the  character of the material.    A number of the more interesting and representative results of the  weighing and analyses of burrow contents are presented herewith in  tabular form. The data for each den, or lot, shows in grams the quantity  of stored material removed and the best estimate it was possible to make  of the percentages or weights of the various species. When the weight  was less than 5 grams, the mere trace of the species frequently is  indicated in the following tables by the abbreviation \"Tr.\"    TABLE 1.--_Analyses of plants stored by _Dipodomys spectabilis  spectabilis_ Merriam, obtained from examination of representative dens  (all except Den 24 from U.

Algiers' efforts to reform one of    the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world began after the    1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country into a severe    recession. In 1989, the government launched a comprehensive,    IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and to    introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite substantial    progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive    stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In September    1993, a new government was formed, one of whose priorities was the    resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.    Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy    foreign debt, Algiers in 1993 resumed negotiations with the IMF and is  "]]]
