She----\"    \"Not that horrible, miserly Miss Brant who lives in that ugly yellow  house on Elm Street?\" interrupted Grace in a horrified tone.    \"Yes, she is the one I mean,\" continued Mabel. \"She took me from an  orphan asylum two years ago. I hated her the first time I ever saw her,  but the matron said I was old enough to work, that I'd have a good home  with her and that I should be paid for my work. She promised to send me  to school, and I was wild to get a good education, so I went with her.  But she is perfectly awful, and I wish I were dead.\"    Her voice ended almost in a wail.    \"I don't blame you,\" said Grace sympathetically. \"She has the reputation  of being one of the most hateful women in Oakdale. I am surprised that  she even allows you to go to school.\"    \"That's just the trouble,\" the girl replied, her voice husky. \"She's  going to take me out of school. I shall be sixteen next month, and  exempt from the school law. So she is going to make me stop school and  go to work in the silk mill. I worked there all through vacation last  summer, and she took every cent of my wages. She took my freshman prize  money, too.\"    \"What a burning shame!\" exclaimed Grace indignantly. \"Haven't you any  relatives at all, Miss Allison, or any one else with whom you could  stay?\"    Mabel shook her head.    \"I don't know anything about myself,\" she said. \"I was picked up on the  street in New York City when I was three years old, and as no one  claimed me, I was put in an orphanage. There was one woman at the  orphanage who was always good to me. She remembered the day they brought  me, and she said that I was beautifully dressed. She always believed  that I had been stolen. She said that I could tell my name, 'Mabel  Isabel Allison,' and that I would be three years old in November, but  that I couldn't tell where I lived. Whenever they asked me I cried and  said I didn't know. She wanted to save my clothes for me, thinking that  by them I might some day find my parents, but the matron took them away  from her, all but three little gold baby pins marked 'M.I.A.' She hid  them away from the matron. When she heard I was to go with Miss Brant,  she kissed me, and gave them to me. She was the only person that ever  cared for me.\"    The tears stood in Grace's eyes.    \"You poor, little thing!\" she cried. \"I care for you, and I'm going to  see if I can do something for you. You shan't stop school if I can help  it. I can't stay with you any longer, just now, because I am going to  Miss Bright's and I am late. It is eight o'clock, you see.\"    The girl gave a little cry of fright.    \"Oh, I didn't think it was so late. I know Miss Brant will be very  angry. She will probably beat me. I am still carrying the marks from the  last whipping she gave me. She sent me out on an errand, but I felt as  though I must be alone, if only for a few minutes. That's why I stopped  in the square.\"    \"Beat you!\" exclaimed Grace. \"How dare she touch you? Why, I never had a  whipping in my life! I won't keep you another minute, but wait for me  outside the campus when school is out to-morrow. I wish to talk further  with you.\"    \"I'll come,\" promised Mabel, her face lighting up. Then she suddenly  threw both arms around Grace's neck and said, \"I do love you, and I feel  that some one cares about me at last.\" Then, like a flash, she darted  across the square and was soon lost to Grace's view.    \"Well, of all things!\" Grace remarked softly to herself. \"I think it's  high time we organized a sorority for the purpose of aiding girls in  distress.\"    \"You're a prompt person. Did you really decide to come?\" were the cries  that greeted her from the porch as she opened the Bright's gate.    \"Save your caustic comments,\" said Grace as she handed Jessica her hat.  \"I have a tale to tell.\"    \"Out with it!\" was the cry, and the girls surrounded Grace, who began  with her meeting with David, and ended with the story of Mabel Allison.    \"You haven't heard anything of those boys yet, have you?\" she asked when  she had finished.    \"Not yet,\" said Nora, \"but never fear, the night is yet young.\"    \"Where is Eleanor Savell?\" asked Grace, noticing for the first time that  Eleanor was not present. \"You promised to go for her, didn't you, Anne?\"    \"I did go,\" replied Anne, \"but she wouldn't come. She said she'd come  sometime when she felt like it. She was playing on the violin when the  maid let me in, and how she can play! She wanted me to stay there with  her and didn't seem to understand why I couldn't break my engagement  with you girls. She said that she always kept her engagements unless the  spirit moved her to do something else.\"    \"Is Eleanor Savell the girl who comes into the study hall every morning  after opening exercises have begun?\" asked Marian Barber.    \"Yes,\" Grace answered. \"I forgot for a moment that you and Eva and  Miriam hadn't met her. She is really very charming, although her ideas  about punctuality and school rules are somewhat hazy as yet. She lives  at 'Heartsease,' Mrs. Gray's property. I am disappointed because she  will not be here to-night. She seemed delighted when I asked her to join  our society.\"    \"As long as we know she isn't coming, don't you think we should begin  the initiation?\" asked Nora. \"It is after eight o'clock and we can't  stay out too late, you know.\"    \"Very well,\" said Grace. \"Blindfold the candidates.\"    The three girls meekly submitted to the blindfolding, and the chums were  about to lead them to the initiation chamber, when the ringing of the  door bell caused them to start.    \"It's David and the boys,\" said Jessica. \"Shall I tell them that they  can't come in?\"    \"Of course,\" responded Nora. \"You and Grace go to the door, while Anne  and I stay here with our victims. Be careful they don't play you a  trick.\"    The two girls cautiously approached the door, opening it very slowly,  and saw--not the three boys--but Eleanor. She smiled serenely and said:  \"Good evening. I decided, after all, that I would come.\"    \"Come right in,\" said Jessica cordially. \"I am so glad you changed your  mind and came. The initiation is about to begin. Have you ever belonged  to a secret society?\"    \"Never,\" replied Eleanor. \"But now that I'm here, I am willing to try  it.\"    \"Come this way.\"    \"Girls,\" said Grace, addressing the three blindfolded girls, \"this is  Eleanor Savell. You can't see her yet, but you may all shake hands with  her. She is to be your companion in misery.\"    Eleanor laughed, shook hands with the others and graciously allowed Nora  to tie a handkerchief over her eyes.    \"All ready! March!\" called Grace, and the eight girls solemnly proceeded  to the initiation chamber.          CHAPTER V    THE PHI SIGMA TAU      At the door a halt was called.    \"Prepare to jump,\" commanded Grace in a deep voice. \"One, two, three!  Jump down! Be careful!\"    The four candidates gave four uncertain jumps and experienced the  disagreeable sensation usually felt in attempting to jump downward when  on level ground. This was one of the oldest and mildest forms of  initiation, but Nora had insisted upon it, and giggled violently as the  four girls prepared for a long leap. Even Grace, who was conducting the  ceremony with the utmost seriousness, laughed a little at the picture  they made.    \"They'll do anything you tell them,\" whispered Nora. Which was perfectly  true. To show fear or reluctance in obeying the demands made upon one,  was to prove one's self unworthy of membership in the Phi Sigma Tau.    \"Let the music begin,\" said Grace.    There was a faint snicker as Anne, Nora and Jessica raised three combs,  wrapped in tissue paper, to their lips and began the \"Merry Widow\"  waltz, with weird effect.    \"You must waltz around the room fifteen times without stopping,\"  continued Grace, \"and then sit down in the four opposite corners of the  room, on the cushions provided for you.\"    The girl chums retreated to the doorway of the room, that had previously  been cleared of almost all the furniture, to watch the movements of  their victims as they endeavored to circle the room the required number  of times. They lost their count, bumped each other at every turn, and  at last staggered dizzily toward what they thought were the corners of  the room. Miriam Nesbit made straight for the door in which the chums  stood, and Grace was obliged to take her by the shoulders and gently  steer her in the opposite direction. Eleanor, after groping along one  side of the room for a corner, was the first to find one, and sank with  a sigh of relief upon the pile of cushions. The other girls had not been  so successful. They all endeavored to sit in the same corner at once, and  Grace was obliged to go to the rescue, and lead two of them to opposite  sides of the initiation chamber.    \"In order to become successful members of this society, it is necessary  for you to sing. You may all sing the first verse and the chorus of any  song you know, only be sure that you don't choose the same song, and don't  stop until you have finished,\" directed Grace. \"Begin after I have counted  three. I will wait for a minute while you choose your song. The orchestra  will accompany you.\"    There was considerable subdued laughter from the orchestra, who had been  instructed to play \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" oblivious of whatever the  candidates might sing.    \"One, two, three!\" counted Grace, and the concert began.    Eva Allen chose \"John Brown's Body.\" Miriam Nesbit, \"Old Kentucky Home.\"  Marian Barber, \"Schooldays,\" while Eleanor contributed \"The Marseillaise\"  in French. The orchestra dutifully burst forth with \"The Star Spangled  Banner,\" and the effect was indescribable.    The orchestra broke down before they reached their chorus, and the  accompaniment ended in a shriek of suppressed mirth, but the candidates  went stolidly on without a smile and finished almost together."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],[0,"The Trained Memory (#6)"],[1,"as to their relative importance. But  do this honestly. Do not be swayed by distracting impulses that  inadvertently slip in. And having gauged their importance give free rein  at once to the impulse to do everything that should not make way for  something more important.    [Sidenote: _Persistence, Accuracy, Dispatch_]    If, for any reason, action must be deferred, fix the matter in your mind  to be called up at the proper time. Drive all other thoughts from your  consciousness. Give your whole attention to this one matter. Determine  the exact moment at which you wish it to be recalled. Then put your  whole self into the determination to remember it at precisely the right  moment. And finally, and perhaps most important of all,--      Rule V. _Have some sign or token._ This memory signal may be  anything you choose, but it must somehow be directly connected with the  hour at which the main event is to be recalled.    [Sidenote: _Memory Signs and Tokens_]    Make a business of observing the memory signs or tokens you have been  habitually using. Practice tagging those matters you wish to recall with  the labels that form a part of your mental machinery.    Make it a habit to do things when they ought to be done and in the order  in which you ought to do them. Habits like this are \"paths\" along which  the mind \"moves,\" paths of least resistance to those qualities of  promptness, energy, persistence, accuracy, self-control, and so on, that  create success.    Success in business, success in life, can come only through the  formation of right habits. A right habit can be deliberately acquired  only by _doing a thing consciously until it comes to be done  unconsciously and automatically_.    [Sidenote: _The Mental Combination Revealed_]    Every man, consciously or unconsciously, forms his own memory habits,  good or bad. Form your memory habits consciously according to the laws  of the mind, and in good time they will act unconsciously and with  masterful precision.    \"'Amid the shadows of the pyramids,' Bonaparte said to his soldiers,  'twenty centuries look down upon you,' and animated them to action and  victory. But all the centuries,\" says W.H. Grove, \"and the eternities,  and God, and the universe, look down upon us--and demand the highest  culture of body, mind and spirit.\"    A good memory is yours for the making. But _you_ must make it. We can  point the way. _You_ must act.    The laws of Association and Recall are the combination that will unlock  the treasure-vaults of memory. Apply these laws, and the riches of  experience will be available to you in every need.           *     *     *     *     *    The purpose of this book has been to make clear certain mental  principles and processes, namely, those of Retention, Association and  Recall. Incidentally, as with every book in this _Course_, it contains  some facts and instructions of immediate practical utility. But  primarily it is intended only to help prepare your mind to understand a  scientific system for success-achievement that will be unfolded in  subsequent volumes."]]]
