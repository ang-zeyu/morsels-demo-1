Reply Obj. 4: It belongs to the Son and Holy Ghost to be sent to  sanctify the creature; and about this several things have to be  believed. Hence it is that there are more articles about the Persons  of the Son and Holy Ghost than about the Person of the Father, Who is  never sent, as we stated in the First Part (Q. 43, A. 4).    Reply Obj. 5: The sanctification of a creature by grace, and its  consummation by glory, is also effected by the gift of charity, which  is appropriated to the Holy Ghost, and by the gift of wisdom, which  is appropriated to the Son: so that each work belongs by  appropriation, but under different aspects, both to the Son and to  the Holy Ghost.    Reply Obj. 6: Two things may be considered in the sacrament of the  Eucharist. One is the fact that it is a sacrament, and in this  respect it is like the other effects of sanctifying grace. The other  is that Christ's body is miraculously contained therein and thus it  is included under God's omnipotence, like all other miracles which  are ascribed to God's almighty power.  _______________________    NINTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 9]    Whether It Is Suitable for the Articles of Faith to Be Embodied in a  Symbol?    Objection 1: It would seem that it is unsuitable for the articles of  faith to be embodied in a symbol. Because Holy Writ is the rule of  faith, to which no addition or subtraction can lawfully be made,  since it is written (Deut. 4:2): \"You shall not add to the word that  I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it.\" Therefore it  was unlawful to make a symbol as a rule of faith, after the Holy  Writ had once been published.    Obj. 2: Further, according to the Apostle (Eph. 4:5) there is but  \"one faith.\" Now the symbol is a profession of faith. Therefore it  is not fitting that there should be more than one symbol.    Obj. 3: Further, the confession of faith, which is contained in the  symbol, concerns all the faithful. Now the faithful are not all  competent to believe in God, but only those who have living faith.  Therefore it is unfitting for the symbol of faith to be expressed  in the words: \"I believe in one God.\"    Obj. 4: Further, the descent into hell is one of the articles of  faith, as stated above (A. 8). But the descent into hell is not  mentioned in the symbol of the Fathers. Therefore the latter is  expressed inadequately.    Obj. 5: Further, Augustine (Tract. xxix in Joan.) expounding the  passage, \"You believe in God, believe also in Me\" (John 14:1) says:  \"We believe Peter or Paul, but we speak only of believing 'in' God.\"  Since then the Catholic Church is merely a created being, it seems  unfitting to say: \"In the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.\"    Obj. 6: Further, a symbol is drawn up that it may be a rule of faith.  Now a rule of faith ought to be proposed to all, and that publicly.  Therefore every symbol, besides the symbol of the Fathers, should be  sung at Mass. Therefore it seems unfitting to publish the articles of  faith in a symbol.    _On the contrary,_ The universal Church cannot err, since she is  governed by the Holy Ghost, Who is the Spirit of truth: for such was  Our Lord's promise to His disciples (John 16:13): \"When He, the  Spirit of truth, is come, He will teach you all truth.\" Now the  symbol is published by the authority of the universal Church.  Therefore it contains nothing defective.    _I answer that,_ As the Apostle says (Heb. 11:6), \"he that cometh to  God, must believe that He is.\" Now a man cannot believe, unless the  truth be proposed to him that he may believe it. Hence the need for  the truth of faith to be collected together, so that it might the more  easily be proposed to all, lest anyone might stray from the truth  through ignorance of the faith. It is from its being a collection of  maxims of faith that the symbol [*The Greek _symballein_] takes its  name.    Reply Obj. 1: The truth of faith is contained in Holy Writ,  diffusely, under various modes of expression, and sometimes  obscurely, so that, in order to gather the truth of faith from Holy  Writ, one needs long study and practice, which are unattainable by  all those who require to know the truth of faith, many of whom have  no time for study, being busy with other affairs. And so it was  necessary to gather together a clear summary from the sayings of  Holy Writ, to be proposed to the belief of all. This indeed was no  addition to Holy Writ, but something taken from it.    Reply Obj. 2: The same doctrine of faith is taught in all the  symbols. Nevertheless, the people need more careful instruction about  the truth of faith, when errors arise, lest the faith of  simple-minded persons be corrupted by heretics. It was this that gave  rise to the necessity of formulating several symbols, which nowise  differ from one another, save that on account of the obstinacy of  heretics, one contains more explicitly what another contains  implicitly.    Reply Obj. 3: The confession of faith is drawn up in a symbol in the  person, as it were, of the whole Church, which is united together by  faith. Now the faith of the Church is living faith; since such is  the faith to be found in all those who are of the Church not only  outwardly but also by merit. Hence the confession of faith is  expressed in a symbol, in a manner that is in keeping with living  faith, so that even if some of the faithful lack living faith, they  should endeavor to acquire it.    Reply Obj. 4: No error about the descent into hell had arisen among  heretics, so that there was no need to be more explicit on that  point. For this reason it is not repeated in the symbol of the  Fathers, but is supposed as already settled in the symbol of the  Apostles. For a subsequent symbol does not cancel a preceding one;  rather does it expound it, as stated above (ad 2).    Reply Obj. 5: If we say: \"'In' the holy Catholic Church,\" this must  be taken as verified in so far as our faith is directed to the Holy  Ghost, Who sanctifies the Church; so that the sense is: \"I believe in  the Holy Ghost sanctifying the Church.\" But it is better and more in  keeping with the common use, to omit the 'in,' and say simply, \"the  holy Catholic Church,\" as Pope Leo [*Rufinus, Comm. in Sym. Apost.]  observes.    Reply Obj. 6: Since the symbol of the Fathers is an explanation of  the symbol of the Apostles, and was drawn up after the faith was  already spread abroad, and when the Church was already at peace, it  is sung publicly in the Mass. On the other hand the symbol of the  Apostles, which was drawn up at the time of persecution, before the  faith was made public, is said secretly at Prime and Compline, as  though it were against the darkness of past and future errors.  _______________________    TENTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 10]    Whether It Belongs to the Sovereign Pontiff to Draw Up a Symbol of  Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that it does not belong to the Sovereign  Pontiff to draw up a symbol of faith. For a new edition of the symbol  becomes necessary in order to explain the articles of faith, as  stated above (A. 9). Now, in the Old Testament, the articles of faith  were more and more explained as time went on, by reason of the truth  of faith becoming clearer through greater nearness to Christ, as  stated above (A. 7). Since then this reason ceased with the advent of  the New Law, there is no need for the articles of faith to be more  and more explicit. Therefore it does not seem to belong to the  authority of the Sovereign Pontiff to draw up a new edition of the  symbol.    Obj. 2: Further, no man has the power to do what is forbidden under  pain of anathema by the universal Church. Now it was forbidden under  pain of anathema by the universal Church, to make a new edition of  the symbol. For it is stated in the acts of the first* council of  Ephesus (P. ii, Act. 6) that \"after the symbol of the Nicene council  had been read through, the holy synod decreed that it was unlawful to  utter, write or draw up any other creed, than that which was defined  by the Fathers assembled at Nicaea together with the Holy Ghost,\" and  this under pain of anathema. [*St. Thomas wrote 'first' (expunged by  Nicolai) to distinguish it from the other council, A.D. 451, known as  the \"Latrocinium\" and condemned by the Pope.] The same was repeated  in the acts of the council of Chalcedon (P. ii, Act. 5). Therefore it  seems that the Sovereign Pontiff has no authority to publish a new  edition of the symbol.    Obj. 3: Further, Athanasius was not the Sovereign Pontiff, but  patriarch of Alexandria, and yet he published a symbol which is sung  in the Church. Therefore it does not seem to belong to the Sovereign  Pontiff any more than to other bishops, to publish a new edition of  the symbol.    _On the contrary,_ The symbol was drawn up by a general council. Now  such a council cannot be convoked otherwise than by the authority of  the Sovereign Pontiff, as stated in the Decretals [*Dist. xvii, Can.  4, 5]. Therefore it belongs to the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff  to draw up a symbol.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Obj. 1), a new edition of the  symbol becomes necessary in order to set aside the errors that may  arise. Consequently to publish a new edition of the symbol belongs to  that authority which is empowered to decide matters of faith finally,  so that they may be held by all with unshaken faith. Now this belongs  to the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, \"to whom the more  important and more difficult questions that arise in the Church are  referred,\" as stated in the Decretals [*Dist. xvii, Can. 5]. Hence  our Lord said to Peter whom he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#6)"],[1,"hands of Columbus  and helped to fix his doctrines of the shape of the world (\"in the form  of a pear\") of the terrestrial paradise, and of the earth's  circumference,--so enormously contracted as practically to abolish the  Pacific.[11]    [Footnote 11: In Columbus' letters to Queen Isabella in 1498, we catch,  as it were, the last echo of the Arabic _melange_ of Moses and Greek  geography, along with the results of Roger Bacon's corrections of  Ptolemy. \"The Old Hemisphere,\" he writes \"which has for its centre the  isle of Arim, is spherical, but the other (new) Hemisphere has the form  of the lower half of a pear. Just one hundred leagues west of the Azores  the earth rises at the Equator and the temperature grows keener. The  summit is over against the mouth of the Orinoco.\"]    To return to the Arabs: We have seen how they not merely followed Greek  theories, which their own experience as conquerors in the Further East  went to discredit, but, in the great outlines of geography, added to  earlier errors, put prejudice in the place of knowledge, and handed on  to Christendom a half-fanciful map of the world. It only remains for us  to illustrate their leading fault, of a too vivid fancy, with a few  details on minor points.    (1.) Ptolemy's \"Habitable Quarter\" of the world, amounting to just half  the longitude of the globe, was literally accepted by the Moslem world,  as it accepted the Pentateuch from the moment when it began its study of  science at the Court of Almamoun (813-833). But, as the conquests of the  Caliphs disclosed districts in the east far beyond Ptolemy's limits, it  was necessary, in case of keeping his data for the whole, to compress  the part which alone was to be found fully described in his chart: \"On  the west, unhappily, there were no countries newly discovered to  compensate for this abridgment.\" By Massoudy's time,--by the tenth  century,--fact and theory were thus hopelessly at variance.    (2.) On the shape of Africa, the mass of Arabic opinion confirmed  Ptolemy, but among the more enlightened there is traceable from  Massoudy's time a tendency either to react towards Strabo's partly  agnostic position, or to invent some new theory rather more in harmony  with the known facts. That is, either their later map-makers cut off  Africa at Cape Non or Bojador and Cape Guardafui, and gave away the rest  to the \"Green Sea of Darkness,\" or, like Massoudy, they sketched a great  Southern Continent, divided from Africa by a narrow channel, which  connected the Western Ocean with the Sea of Habasch--of Abyssinia or  India. In either case Africa was left an island.    (3.) The words \"Gog and Magog\" from Jeremiah, describing the nomades of  Central Asia, appear in the Koran as Yadjoudj and Madjoudj. The complete  story, in the tenth century and in Edrisi's day, connects them with  Alexander the Great, who is also found in the Koran as Doul-Carnain, and  with the Wall of China. \"When the Conqueror,\" said the Arabs, \"reached  the place near where the sun rose, he was implored to build a wall to  shut off the marauders of Yadjoudj and Madjoudj from the rich countries  of the South.\" So he built a rampart of iron across the pass by which  alone Touran joined Iran, and henceforth Turks and Tartars were kept  outside. Till the Arabs reached the Caucasus, they generally supposed  this to answer to Alexander's wall; when facts dispelled this theory,  the unknown Ural or Altai Mountains served instead; finally, as the  Moslems became masters of Central Asia, the Wall of China, beyond the  Gobi desert, alone satisfied the conditions of shadowy but historic  grandeur, beyond all practical danger of verification.    (4.) In striking contrast with the steady advance of Arabic exploration  and trade in the Eastern Sea is the Moslem horror of the Western Ocean  beyond Europe and Africa, the \"Green Sea of Darkness\" or the Atlantic.  And what we have to note is that they imparted much of this paralysing  cowardice to the Christian nations. Only the Northmen of Scandinavia,  living a life apart, and forced to make their way over the wild North  Sea, were untouched by this southern superstition, and ventured across  the ocean by the Faeroes, Iceland, and Greenland, to the coast of  Labrador.    The doctors of the Koran indeed thought that a man mad enough to embark  for the unknown, even on a coasting voyage, should be deprived of civil  rights. Ibn Said goes further, and says no one has ever done this:  \"whirlpools always destroy any adventurer.\" As late as the generation  immediately before Henry the Navigator, about A.D. 1390, another light  of Moslem science declared the Atlantic to be \"boundless, so that ships  dare not venture out of sight of land, for even if the sailors knew the  direction of the winds, they would not know whither those winds would  carry them, and as there is no inhabited country beyond, they would run  a risk of being lost in mist, fog, and vapour. The limit of the West is  the Atlantic Ocean.\"    This was the final judgment of the Arabic race and its subject allies  upon the western limits of the world, and in two ways they helped to fix  this belief, derived from the timid coasting-traders of the Roman Empire  on Greek and Latin Christendom. First, the Spanish Caliphate cut off all  access to the Western Sea beyond the Bay of Biscay, from the eighth to  the twelfth centuries. Not till the capture of Lisbon in 1147, could  Christian enterprise on this side gain any basis, or starting-point. Not  till the conquest of the Algarve in the extreme south-west of the  peninsula, at the end of the twelfth century, was this enterprise free  to develop itself. Secondly, in the darkest ages of Christian  depression, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth centuries,  when only the brief age of Charlemagne offered any chance of an  independent and progressive Catholic Empire in the west, the Arabs  became recognised along with the Byzantines as the main successors of  Greek culture. The science, the metaphysic, the abstract ideas of these  centuries came into Germany, France, and Italy from Cordova and from  Bagdad, as much as from Byzantium. And on questions like the South  Atlantic or Indian Ocean, or the shape of Africa,--where Islam had all  the field to itself, and there was no positive and earlier discovery  which might contradict a natural reluctance to test tradition by  experiment--Christendom accepted the Arabic verdict with deference.    In the same way, on still more difficult points, such as the theory of  a canal from the Caspian to the Black Sea, or from the Caspian to the  Arctic circle, or from the Black Sea to the Baltic, Paris and Rome and  Bologna and Oxford accepted the Arabic descriptions.    It has been necessary for us to attend to the defects of Arabic  geography, in order to understand how in the long Saracen control of the  world's trade routes and of geographical tradition, science and  seamanship were so little advanced. Between Ptolemy and Henry of  Portugal, between the second and the fifteenth centuries, the only great  extension of men's knowledge of the world was: (1) in the extreme north,  where the semi-Christian, semi-Pagan Vikings reached perhaps as far as  the present site of New York and founded, on another side, the Mediaeval  Kingdom of Russia; (2) on the south-east coast of Africa, from Cape  Guardafui to Madagascar, which was opened up by the trading interest of  the Emosaid family (800-1300); (3) in the far east, in Central and  Further Asia, by the discoveries of Marco Polo and the Friar preachers  following on the tracks of the earlier Moslem travellers. The first of  these was a Northern secret, soon forgotten, or an abortive development,  cut short by the Tartars; the second was an Arabic secret, jealously  guarded as a commercial right; the third alone added much direct new  knowledge to the main part of the civilised world.    But throughout their period of commercial rule from the eighth to the  twelfth centuries, the Arabs took a keen interest in land traffic,  conquest, and exploration. They were of small account at sea; it took  them some time to turn to their own purposes Hippalus' discovery (in the  second century A.D.) of the monsoon in the Indian Ocean; but, on land,  Moslem travellers and writers--generally following in the wake of their  armies, but sometimes pressing on ahead of them--did not a little to  enlarge the horizon of the Mohammedan world, though it was not till  Marco Polo and the Franciscan missionaries of the thirteenth and  fourteenth centuries, that Christian Europe shared in this gain.    As the early Caliphs conquered, they made surveys of their new  dominions. Thus after Tarik and Mousa had overrun Spain, Walid at  Damascus required from them an account of the land and its resources.  The universal obligation of the Mecca pilgrimage compelled every Moslem  to travel once in his life; and many an Arab, after the Caliphate was  settled in power from the Oxus to the Pyrenees, journeyed to and fro  with the joy of a master going over vast estates, shewing his dreaded  turban to subjects of every nation.    This, however, was not geographical science, or even pseudo-science.  Before Mohammed the Arabs had possessed some knowledge of the stars and  used it for astrology; but it was at the Court of Almamoun (813-833)  that their inquiring spirits first set themselves to answer the great  question of geography--Where? Through the ninth and tenth centuries  there arose a succession of travellers and thinkers who, with all their  wild dreamings, preserved the best results of Greek maps and would have  made much greater advances but for their helplessness in original work.  As they could not recast Aristotle in philosophy, so they could not with  all their new knowledge of the Further East recast the geography of  Ptolemy and Strabo.    A few great ages, the age for instance of Almamoun in Bagdad (A.D. 830),  of "]]]
