The entrance was  rendered additionally dangerous to myself because I stumbled over the  legs of several sleeping soldiers. I felt inclined to remonstrate with  the officer-in-charge of the escort at the treatment I was receiving,  but the uninviting armed sentry at the door frustrated my efforts very  effectively.    It was an improvised guard-room. The soldiers sprawled upon the straw  littering the floor, striving to snatch a brief rest before going on  duty, sleepily raised themselves to ascertain the cause of the  disturbance. The sentry told them excitedly the charge upon which I had  been arrested, at which the men turned to blink wonderingly upon the  \"Englandische Spion!\" I was not sorry when they at last wearied of  gazing upon me as if I were a freak side-show, and sank down to finish  their two hours' rest before going on guard once more.    I had barely recovered my senses when the door again flew open and two  further prisoners were injected into the room in a manner comparable  with my own entrance. They were Hindoo students--young fellows returning  to England after a continental holiday, who had been detained. Both were  somewhat alarmed, but I speedily composed them. Later there was a  repetition of the performance to admit three more Indian students. We  all agreed that the German methods of introduction were decidedly novel  and forceful if informal and unpleasant. The latest arrivals, however,  were detained for only a short while. They were rich in funds and were  equally astute in their distribution of largesse to advantage. Money  talked in their instance to distinct effect. The three of us who were  left maintained a conversation in whispers and finally came to the  conclusion that the best thing we could do was to seek sleep so as to be  fit for the enquiry which was certain to take place.    I was dog-tired, but the authorities, as represented by the sentries,  were not disposed to let us enjoy what they were denied. The guard was  constantly changing and the clattering and rasping of orders and  commands repeatedly woke us up. Then again, at frequent intervals, the  sentry would enter. Seeing me asleep he would either give me a prod with  his bayonet or a smart rap with the butt-end of his rifle to wake me up,  the idea no doubt being to impress upon me the serious nature of my  position and to inflict upon me the utmost discomfort.    Being prevented from sleeping and commencing to feel the pangs of  hunger, having eaten nothing since lunch upon the train, I asked for  something to eat. The sentry was very sorry but related that food was  quite out of the question because none of the officers in charge of me  from whom he could obtain the necessary instructions were available.    [*large gap]    The absence of the officers was explained a little later. They had been  searching for an interpreter, so that I might be put through another  inquisition. This interpreter was about the most incompetent of his  class that one could wish to meet. His English was execrable--far worse  than Chinese pidgin--and he had an unhappy and disconcerting manner of  intermingling German and English words, while either through a physical  defect or from some other cause, he could not pronounce his consonants  correctly.    I was taken through the usual rigmarole such as I had at first  experienced at Goch. The evidence also, as usual, was committed to  paper. It was a perfunctory enquiry, however, and was soon completed.  Naturally upon its conclusion I considered that I would be free to  resume my journey. I turned to my interpreter.    \"Now this is all over I suppose I can go?\"    \"Ach! nein zoo tant doh!\"    His English was so vile that I thought he said and meant \"ah! at nine  you can go!\"    Seeing that it was about eleven o'clock at the time, I thought I had  better hurry in case there was another Flushing-bound train. So I  scuttled towards the door only to receive another heavy clout from the  sentry's rifle. What the interpreter really said was \"Ah! No, you can't  go!\" As I rubbed my bruised head I treated that interpreter to a candid  opinion of his English speaking qualifications, but he did not  understand half what I said.    As I realised nothing further could be done that night I lay down to  snatch another rest. But after midnight my trials and troubles  increased. Every few minutes the door would rattle and be clanked open  to admit an officer who had brought a number of friends to see the  latest sensation--the English spies. The friends, who were  brother-officers, regarded us with a strange interest, while the officer  who had charge of me strutted to and fro like a peacock drawn to his  full height, at the unique greatness thrust upon him, and dwelling at  great length upon the enormity of our offence related a weird story  about my capture.    Upon such occasions I and my two Hindoo companions were compelled to  stand at attention. At first I regarded the incident with amusement,  but after we had been through the circus-like performance about a dozen  times, it became distinctly irksome, especially as I was dog-tired. It  was with the greatest difficulty I maintained my self-control.    About four o'clock in the morning I heard voices in the adjoining room.  Evidently someone in authority had arrived. I decided to seize the  opportunity to secure an interview with one who at least would be able  to give me some satisfaction. I moved smartly towards the door. The  sentry lowered his rifle, but I evaded the bayonet, I saw a flash and  then all was darkness.    Some time later I woke up. I was lying at full length upon the floor and  my head was singing like a kettle, while it ached fearfully. I opened my  eyes but for some minutes could descry nothing but stars. As I came  round I made out the dim forms of the two Hindoo students bending over  me. They were extremely agitated, but their peace of mind became  restored somewhat when I at last sat up. Then they explained what had  happened. After I had dodged the bayonet the soldier had swung his rifle  round bringing the butt end smartly down upon my head and had knocked me  silly. From the pain I suffered and the size of the lump which I could  feel I tacitly agreed that I had received a pretty smart rap.    I felt round for the tin of cigarettes which I had extemporised to form  a pillow before the incident, but was suddenly reminded that smoking was  very much _verboten_. Regarding the tin longingly I absent-mindedly  opened it. To my surprise I found that the fifty cigarettes which it had  originally contained had dwindled down to one! I looked at the sentry  and smiled quietly to myself. Rising to my feet I held out the open tin  to him.    \"You've been helping yourself while I have been asleep and I think you  might as well take the last one,\" I muttered sarcastically.    The phlegmatic sentry looked at me cunningly. His face lapsed into a  broad grin. Growling \"danker!\" (thank you!) he calmly took it and  lighted up. From this incident I discovered that even a thick-skulled,  dull-witted German infantryman has a bump of humour.    The din which still reigned around the station told me that the crowd  was impatient to see me. In fact Bedlam appeared to have been let loose.  The news of my capture had spread through Wesel like wildfire, and  public animosity and hostility towards me had risen to fever-heat.  During the night the crowd had swollen considerably, and it clung  tenaciously to the station in the hope of having some glorious fun at my  expense.    At six o'clock an officer entered with one or two subordinates and a  squad of soldiers. Certain formalities had to be gone through in which I  played a prominent part. These completed the officer stood before me  with all the pomposity he could command and delivered a harangue at high  speed in a worrying monotone. To me it was gibberish, but one of the men  who could speak English informed me that the gist of his wail was the  intimation that \"if I moved a pace to the right, or a pace to the left,  or fell back a pace, or hurried a pace during the march to the Wesel  Arresthaus--Wesel Prison--I would be shot down immediately.\" I mentally  decided to obey the injunction to the absolute letter, and must admit  that never before or since during my life have I walked such a straight  line.    With four soldiers behind with lowered bayonets, four in front and two  on either side we moved out of the station. The clock was chiming seven,  but the droning of the clock was drowned by the howls of rage,  snarlings, screeches, shrieks and groans of fury which went up from the  mob the moment they caught sight of us. Despite my self-control I  winced. Directly we gained the roadway an ugly rush was made. I thought  I was doomed to be torn limb from limb, for I was overwhelmed by a sea  of itching hands, shaking fists, and gnashing teeth. The escort wavered  and was all but overwhelmed. Although it quivered ominously before the  mob assault it stood its ground. Swinging their rifles over their heads  the soldiers lashed out with the butt-ends. A sharp order rang out. We  turned about and hastily returned to the station. Here the officer  demanded a double escort, which was granted, and we made another attempt  to reach the Arresthaus.    But the increased parade of military power only served to infuriate the  crowd still more. They surged, swayed, and pressed, and howled, groaned,  and shrieked as if bereft. Baulked in their desire to snatch us from the  soldiers they began to fling missiles of all descriptions. Fortunately  they were too excited to throw with pronounced accuracy, although my two  Hindoo companions and I were struck several times with vegetables. Then  a bottle came singing through the air. I ducked, but it struck the  soldier beside me full on the side of the face to shatter into a score  of pieces. The blow was so terrific as to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18157"],[0,"Fundación de la ciudad de Buenos-Aires (#6)"],[1," de suso, salieron y se juntaron á hacer la medida de  tierras contenida en el dicho cabildo, Mateo Leal de Ayala, Alcalde  ordinario, Pedro Gutierrez y Francisco Romero, Regidores, diputados por  el dicho Cabildo para el dicho efecto.
