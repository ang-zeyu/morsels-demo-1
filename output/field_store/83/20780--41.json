The cylinder should never be in motion while the templet  is being used.          CHAPTER VIII    FINISHING AND POLISHING      To get a high and lasting polish on wood, the work must be first sanded  so as to be perfectly smooth. In addition to this, open grained wood,  such as oak, must be properly filled with a wood filler. If properly  sharpened tools have been used very little sanding is required, and then  worn sandpaper should be used as it does not cut into the work as new  paper cuts. Remember sandpaper is not to be used as a tool in cutting  down stock when working to dimensions. In using old sandpaper run the  lathe at a moderate speed to avoid burning the wood, especially on  square or round fillets. Keep the edges of the work sharp and do not  wear them round. In using new sandpaper use a fine grit (00 or 0) and  move the paper from one end of the work to the other slowly, so that no  scratches result on the surface of the work.    The work may be finished by one of two methods. In the first method as  in finishing ordinary cabinet work, the pieces should be stained and  filled. In applying filler, run the lathe at the slowest speed after the  material has dried sufficiently to rub into the pores of the wood. If  the highlights are to be brought out, as in the case of oak, stain and  then give a light coat of shellac, and apply the filler after the  shellac is dry. The shellac keeps the dark filler from staining the  flakes of the oak darker, and the pores of the wood fill in as before.  The pores become darker than the flakes, and at the same time a smooth  surface is produced. After the filler has hardened the wood may be waxed  or varnished.    The second method, or French polishing, is rather difficult to apply and  requires a little skill. A close grained wood, like maple, will be found  more satisfactory for the beginner. An open grained wood may be filled  in the ordinary way, or the grain may be filled by rubbing into the  pores of the wood a combination of shellac, rotten stone or pumice, oil  and alcohol. Rotten stone is used for dark wood and pumice is used for  light wood. The wood may be left in the natural or stained as in the  first method. The mixture of shellac, rotten stone, oil and alcohol, is  applied to the work with a pad made of cotton waste, wrapped in cheese  cloth to keep it from sticking to the work. It should be about 1-1/2\" in  diameter and 1/2\" thick. Hold the pad over the mouth of a bottle of  shellac and tip the bottle so that the shellac comes in contact with the  pad. The shellac will remain clean in a bottle and will be handy. The  mouth of the shellac bottle should be about 1\" in diameter and should be  dipped once. Do likewise with a bottle, having a mouth 1/2\" in diameter,  containing alcohol. This should be dipped twice allowing the alcohol to  dilute the shellac. Then drop on a couple of drops of oil and rub over  the pad evenly; this aids in distributing the shellac properly and keeps  the pad from sticking to the work. A bottle may also be used for this.  For the rotten stone use a pepper shaker so that it may be sifted on the  work as needed.    When the mixture has been applied to the pad, hold the pad against the  work lightly at first, until most of the moisture has been worked out of  it, and then gradually increase the pressure until the pad is almost  dry. In putting on the first coat, use more shellac and alcohol and just  enough oil at all times to prevent the pad from sticking to the work.  However, the pad should not contain as much shellac that it can be  squeezed out with the fingers. When the pad is dry, another mixture is  applied, and where open grained wood is used, rotten stone, or pumice  stone, is sprinkled on the work to gradually fill up the pores and to  build up a smooth surface. Run the lathe at a low speed, depending on  the size of the piece that is being polished. Allow the first coat to  dry before applying a second coat for, if too much is put on at any one  time, the heat generated in the rubbing will cause the shellac to pull,  and it will form rings by piling up. These rings may be worked out in  two ways, either by a slight pressure of the pad on the rings or by  cutting them with alcohol applied to the pad. If too much alcohol is  used it will cut through the shellac and remove what has already been  rubbed on. If at any time too much shellac is used it will pile up and  form rings. Too much rotten stone will cut down the polish and by  absorbing the mixture will leave the pad dry. If too much oil is used  the polish will become dull after a day or two.    After the first coat has hardened apply the second, but use less shellac  and more alcohol and just enough oil to prevent the pad from sticking.  This may be done by dipping the tip of a finger in the oil and spreading  it over the pad. The entire mixture should be so that only a dampness  can be felt on the pad. As the process goes on less oil and shellac are  used. All oil must be removed when applying the last coat, or the piece  will lose its polish. All the pores should be filled, and no rings  should be on the finished work. Where a natural finish is desired, apply  a coat of boiled linseed oil twelve hours before the work is to be  polished. This will bring out the grain and will also aid in applying  the first coat; no oil need then be used in the first coat.    A great amount of practice and patience is required to get a first class  polish. Polishing can only be learned by experience. Correct your  troubles in properly proportioning the mixture. Never use too much  shellac as it will build up too fast and will not harden, thus causing  rings; or it will pull and catch to the pad, thus forming bunches. The  purpose of alcohol is mainly to dilute the shellac and to prevent  against putting it on the work too fast, but care must be taken not to  use too much alcohol to cut the shellac entirely. The oil helps to  distribute the shellac evenly, but it must be removed when finishing the  last coat, or the polish will not remain. It also helps to keep the pad  from sticking to the work.    It is impossible to obtain a polish that will be as lasting and rich by  any method other than the one described. For success it is essential to  learn the proportions of the mixture and to acquire skill in applying  the materials by using exactly the right pressure and the right movement  of the pad.          CHAPTER IX    FACE-PLATE AND CHUCK TURNING      Face-plate and chuck turning open an entirely new field of work from  that taken up in previous chapters of this book. If handled correctly,  it has much greater educational and practical value than cylinder  turning. From the practical standpoint the field of work is broader and  the models to be made are of much greater value. Aside from this, trade  methods and practices can be applied and a broad insight into commercial  work can be given the student.    In some details of chuck turning the tool operations already learned can  be employed, but for the most part they are entirely different. In order  to preserve the educational value of the work as brought out by skill  and dexterity in handling tools, it will be necessary to use the cutting  method wherever possible. In some instances that method will be  impossible, and the scraping method must be used.      METHODS OF FASTENING STOCK    All the work thus far has been on models where the stock worked upon is  held between the live and dead centers. In face-plate and chuck turning  the work is done at the head stock only and the piece is supported by  means of a face-plate, or chuck, that is fastened to a face-plate, which  is screwed onto the end of the live spindle. There are three methods of  fastening stock to the face-plate, and it depends upon the nature of the  exercise or model to be made which method is used.    1. SMALL SINGLE SCREW FACE-PLATE. For all work that does not require  deep cutting in the center, such as in towel rings, picture frames,  etc., the small face-plate with a single screw should be used.    Note:--Should it be found difficult to keep the block from working loose  and turning, it is a good plan to fold a piece of sandpaper, grit side  out, and place it between the face-plate and the stock.    2. LARGE SURFACE SCREW FACE-PLATE. For all work that does not require  deep cutting on the outside, such as exercises, jewel boxes, etc., as  well as all large stock, and all stock from which chucks are to be  made, the large face-plate with the surface screws should be used.    3. GLUING TO WASTE STOCK. A block of scrap wood is fastened to a  face-plate the same as for a chuck and surfaced off square. The block  from which the model is to be made is planed square on one side and  glued to the block on the face-plate with a sheet of paper between the  two. To separate the model from the chuck, after it is completed, place  a chisel on the waste stock, 1/16\" back of the glue joint at such a  point as will bring the chisel parallel to the grain of the model, and  strike lightly with a mallet. This will cause the paper to separate and  the model to become free.    This method will be found very convenient epecially on models where the  base is to be left straight. It will also be found to save much stock  when working with expensive woods.      LATHE ADJUSTMENTS    To get the best results in face-plate or chuck turning there should be  no end play in the spindle of the lathe. The spindle should always be  tested out, and if any play is found, should be adjusted before  attempting any work. It is almost impossible to make a true cut when  such a condition obtains.      POSITION OF TOOL REST    For all face-plate and chuck turning the tool rest should be kept as  close to the stock as possible, the same as in spindle turning,  regardless of the angle it may be set. Vertically, the rest in most  cases should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#6)"],[1,"--Cooking (by use of steam from small amount of water)  tough cuts of meat which have been browned but not cooked thoroughly.    Season meat. Dredge with flour. Sear in hot pan until well browned.  Place oil rack in pot containing water to height of one inch, but do  not let water reach the meat. Keep water slowly boiling. Replenish as  needed with boiling water. This method renders tough cuts tender, but  requires several hours cooking.    2.

Study and know what  the actual needs are, and you will not make unnecessary expenditures.    Learn what the various cuts of meat are, what they can be used for,  and which are best suited to the particular needs of your household.    Study the timeliness of buying certain cuts of meats. There are days  when prices are lower than normal.    Always check the butcher's weights by watching him closely or by  weighing the goods on scales of your own.    Always buy a definite quantity. Ask what the pound rate is, and note  any fractional part of the weight. Don't ask for \"ten or twenty cents'  worth.\"    Select your meat or fish personally. There is no doubt that high  retail prices are due to the tendency of many housewives to do their  buying by telephone or through their servants.    Test the freshness of meat and fish. Staleness of meat and fish is  shown by loose and flabby flesh. The gills of fresh fish are red and  the fins stiff.    Make all the purchases possible at a public market, if you can walk  to it, or if carfare will not make too large an increase in the amount  you have set aside for the day's buying.    A food chopper can be made to pay for itself in a short time by the  great variety of ways it furnishes of utilizing left-overs.    If possible, buy meat trimmings. They cost 20 cents a pound and can be  used in many ways.    Buy the ends of bacon strips. They are just as nutritious as sliced  bacon and cost 50 per cent. less.    Learn to use drippings in place of butter for cooking purposes.    Buy cracked eggs. They cost much less than whole ones and are usually  just as good.    Keep a stock pot. Drop into it all left-overs. These make an excellent  basis for soup stock.    Don't throw away the heads and bones of fish. Clean them and use them  with vegetables for fish chowder or cream of fish soup.    Study attractive ways of serving food. Plain, cheap, dishes can be  made appetizing if they look attractive on the table.    Experiment with meat substitutes. Cheese, dried vegetables and the  cheaper varieties of fish can supply all the nutriment of meat at a  much lower cost.    Don't do your cooking \"by guess.\" If the various ingredients are  measured accurately, the dish will taste better and cost less.    Don't buy delicatessen food if you can possibly avoid it. Delicatessen  meals cost 15 per cent. more than the same meals cooked at home, and  the food is not as nourishing. You pay for the cooking and the rent of  the delicatessen store, as well as the proprietor's profit.    Don't pay five or ten cents more a dozen for white eggs in the belief  that they are superior to brown eggs. The food value of each is the  same. The difference in shell color is due to the breed of hen.    Tell the butcher to give you the trimmings of chicken, i.e., the head,  feet, fat and giblets. They make delicious chicken soup. The feet  contain gelatine, which gives soup consistency.    Buy a tough, and consequently less expensive, chicken and make it  tender by steaming it for three hours before roasting.    Don't put meat wrapped in paper into the ice-box, as the paper tends  to absorb the juices.    Try to find a way to buy at least a part of your meats and eggs direct  from the farm. You will get fresher, better food, and if it is sent by  parcels post it can usually be delivered to your table for much less  than city prices.
