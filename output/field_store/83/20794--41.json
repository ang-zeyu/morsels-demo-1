Mr. Hale makes it Chinook. It is certainly,  however, neither Chinook nor Chihalis; and Jewitt gives _kakoelth_ as  Nootka, while I find the Makah word _kotlo,_ and the Nittinat _kotl._    ~Mit-ass~, _n._ Cree, MITAS. (Anderson.) _Leggings._ A word imported by  the Canadian French.    ~Mit'-lite~, _v._ Chinook, MITLAIT. _To sit; sit down; stay at; reside;  remain._ It is also used in place of _to have_ and _to be._ Ex.

Mr.  Anderson derives it from the Cree word _moostoos,_ a buffalo, and supposes  it to have been imported by the Canadians; but Father Pandosy makes  _musmus_ Yakama.    ~Moo'-Sum~, _v., n._ Chihalis, MUSAM. _To sleep; sleep._ Tikegh moosum,  _or_ olo moosum, _to be sleepy_ (literally, _to want, or be hungry for  sleep_); nika hyas moosum, _I slept very sound._    ~Mow-itsh~, or ~Mah'-witsh~, _n._ Nootka, MAUITSH (Hale); Nittinat,  MOITSH, _a deer;_ Nootka, MOOWATSH, a _bear_ (Jewitt). _A deer; venison._  Frequently used to signify a wild animal; as, huloima mowitch, _a strange  or different kind of beast._ The meaning given in Jewitt's book is  probably a misprint. Like _moolock,_ an elk, the word is found in the  Koquilth of Humboldt Bay.    ~Muck-a-muck~, _n., v._ Quaere u. d. MAKAMAK (Hale). _To eat; to bite;  food._ Muckamuck chuck, &c., _to drink water, or other liquid._ Neither  Chinook nor Chihalis. Mr. Anderson considers it an invented word.    ~Mus'-ket~, _n._ English, idem. _A gun or musket._ Stick musket, _a bow._      ~N.~    ~Na.~ The interrogative particle. Ex. Mika na klatawa okook sun? _do you  go to-day?_ Interrogation is, however, often conveyed by intonation only.    ~Na-ah, _n._ Chinook, TLKANAA. _A mother._ (Hale.) Peculiar to the  Columbia, and now in fact obsolete, the Euglish MA'MA being used instead.    ~Nah~, _interj._ Common to several languages. _Look here! I say!_ Nah  sikhs! _halloo, friend!_ Also used in common conversation to call  attention to some point not thoroughly understood. In the Yakama language,  it is the sign of the vocative; as, nah tehn! _O man._    ~Nan'-itsh~, _v._ Quaere u. d. _To see; look; look for; seek._ Nanitsh!  _look there!_ kloshe nanitsh! _look out! take care!_ cultus nanitsh, _to  look round idly, or from curiosity only._ Mamook nanitsh, _to show._ The  word is neither Chinook nor Chihalis. Dr. Scouler gives _nannanitch_ as  Nootka and Columbian. It is possibly tbe former.    ~Nau'-its~, _adv._ Chihalis, NOITSH. Mr. Hale gives this for _off shore;  on the stream._ It means, according to Mr. Anderson, the _sea-beach,_  and  is not properly a Jargon word.    ~Na-wit'-ka~, _adv._ Chinook, idem; Klikatat and Yakama, N'WITKA. _Yes;  certainly; yes indeed; to be sure._ Nawitka wake nika kumtuks, _indeed I  don't know._ In answer to a negative question, many Indians use it as  affirming the negative. Ex. Wake mika nanitsh? _did you not see [it]?_  Nawitka, _I did not._    ~Nem, _n._ English, NAME. _A name._ Mamook nem, _to name, or call by  name._    ~Ne-nam-ooks, _n._ Chinook, ENANAMUKS. _The land otter._    ~Ne si'-ka~, _pron._ Chinook, NISAIKA. _We; us; our._    ~Ne'-whah.~ Chinook, NIWHA. It seems to be an adverb used, as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15673"],[0,"The Day of the Beast (#6)"],[1,"  to them and they would see what it had done to him. A peculiar  significance lay between his sister and Helen--all these girls, and  the fact of his having gone to war.    \"They may not think of it, but _I know_,\" he muttered to himself. And  he sat down upon his bed to plan how best to meet them, and others. He  did not know what he was going to encounter, but he fortified himself  against calamity. Strange portent of this had crossed the sea to haunt  him. As soon as he was sure of what had happened in Middleville, of  the attitude people would have toward a crippled soldier, and of what  he could do with the month or year that might be left him to live,  then he would know his own mind. All he sensed now was that there had  been some monstrous inexplicable alteration in hope, love, life. His  ordeal of physical strife, loneliness, longing was now over, for he  was back home. But he divined that his greater ordeal lay before him,  here in this little house, and out there in Middleville. All the  subtlety, intelligence, and bitter vision developed by the war  sharpened here to confront him with terrible possibilities. Had his  countrymen, his people, his friends, his sweetheart, all failed him?  Was there justice in Blair Maynard's scorn? Lane's faith cried out in  revolt. He augmented all possible catastrophe, and then could not  believe that he had sacrificed himself in vain. He knew himself. In  him was embodied all the potentiality for hope of the future. And it  was with the front and stride of a soldier, facing the mystery, the  ingratitude, the ignorance and hell of war, that he left his room and  went down stairs to meet the evils in store.    His mother was not in the kitchen. The door stood open. He heard her  outside talking to a neighbor woman, over the fence.    \"--Daren looks dreadful,\" his mother was saying in low voice. \"He  could hardly walk.... It breaks my heart. I'm glad to have him  along--but to see him waste away, day by day, like Mary Dean's boy--\"  she broke off.    \"Too bad! It's a pity,\" replied the neighbor. \"Sad--now it comes home  to us. My son Ted came in last night and said he'd talked with a boy  who'd seen young Maynard and the strange soldier who was with him.  They must be worse off than Daren--Blair Maynard with only one leg  and--\"    \"Mother, where are you? I'm hungry,\" called Lane, interrupting that  conversation.    She came hurriedly in, at once fearful he might have heard, and  solicitous for his welfare.    \"Daren, you look better in daylight--not so white,\" she said. \"You sit  down now, and let me get your breakfast.\"    Lane managed to eat a little this morning, which fact delighted his  mother.    \"I'm going to see Dr. Bronson,\" said Lane, presently. \"Then I'll go to  Manton's, and round town a little. And if I don't tire out I'll call  on Helen. Of course Lorna has gone to work?\"    \"Oh yes, she leaves at half after eight.\"    \"Mother, I was awake last night when she got home,\" went on Lane,  seriously. \"It was one o'clock. She came in a car. I heard girls  tittering. And some boy came up on the porch with Lorna and kissed  her. Well, that might not mean much--but something about their talk,  the way it was done--makes me pretty sick. Did you know this sort of  thing was going on?\"    \"Yes. And I've talked with mothers who have girls Lorna's age. They've  all run wild the last year or so. Dances and rides! Last summer I was  worried half to death. But we mothers don't think the girls are really  _bad_. They're just crazy for fun, excitement, boys. Times and  pleasures have changed. The girls say the mothers don't understand.  Maybe we don't. I try to be patient. I trust Lorna. I can't see  through it all.\"    \"Don't worry, mother,\" said Lane, patting her hand. \"I'll see through  it for you. And if Lorna is--well, running too much--wild as you  said--I'll stop her.\"    His mother shook her head.    \"One thing we mothers all agree on. These girls, of this generation,  say fourteen to sixteen, _can't_ be stopped.\"    \"Then that is a serious matter. It must be a peculiarity of the day.  Maybe the war left this condition.\"    \"The war changed all things, my son,\" replied his mother, sadly.    Lane walked thoughtfully down the street toward Doctor Bronson's  office. As long as he walked slowly he managed not to give any hint of  his weakness. The sun was shining with steely brightness and the March  wind was living up to its fame. He longed for summer and hot days in  quiet woods or fields where daisies bloomed. Would he live to see the  Indian summer days, the smoky haze, the purple asters?    Lane was admitted at once into the office of Doctor Bronson, a little,  gray, slight man with shrewd, kind eyes and a thoughtful brow. For  years he had been a friend as well as physician to the Lanes, and he  had always liked Daren. His surprise was great and his welcome warm.  But a moment later he gazed at Lane with piercing eyes.    \"Look here, boy, did you go to the bad over there?\" he demanded.    \"How do you mean, Doctor?\"    \"Did you let down--debase yourself morally?\"    \"No. But I went to the bad physically and spiritually.\"    \"I see that. I don't like the color of your face.... Well, well,  Daren. It was hell, wasn't it? Did you kill a couple of Huns for me?\"    Questions like this latter one always alienated Lane in some  unaccountable way. It must have been revealed in his face.    \"Never mind, Daren. I see that you _did_.... I'm glad you're back  alive. Now what can I do for you?\"    \"I've been discharged from three hospitals in the last two months--not  because I was well, but because I was in better shape than some other  poor devil. Those doctors in the service grew hard--they had to be  hard--but they saw the worst, the agony of the war. I always felt  sorry for them. They never seemed to eat or sleep or rest. They had no  time to save a man. It was cut him up or tie him up--then on to the  next.... Now, Doc, I want you to look me over and--well--tell me what  to expect.\"    \"All right,\" replied Doctor Bronson, gruffly.    \"And I want you to promise not to tell mother or any one. Will you?\"    \"Yes, I promise. Now come in here and get off some of your clothes.\"    \"Doctor, it's pretty tough on me to get in and out of my clothes.\"    \"I'll help you. Now tell me what the Germans did to you.\"    Lane laughed grimly. \"Doctor, do you remember I was in your Sunday  School class?\"    \"Yes, I remember that. What's it got to do with Germans?\"    \"Nothing. It struck me funny, that's all.... Well, to get it over. I  was injured several times at the training camp.\"    \"Anything serious?\"    \"No, I guess not. Anyway I forgot about _them._ Doctor, I was shot  four times, once clear through. I'll show you. Got a bad bayonet jab  that doesn't seem to heal well. Then I had a dose of both  gases--chlorine and mustard--and both all but killed me. Last I've a  weak place in my spine. There's a vertebra that slips out of place  occasionally. The least movement may do it. I _can't_ guard against  it. The last time it slipped out I was washing my teeth. I'm in  mortal dread of this. For it twists me out of shape and hurts  horribly. I'm afraid it'll give me paralysis.\"    \"Humph! It would. But it can be fixed.... So that's all they did to  you?\"    Underneath the dry humor of the little doctor, Lane thought he  detected something akin to anger.    \"Yes, that's all they did to my body,\" replied Lane.    Doctor Bronson, during a careful and thorough examination of Lane's  heart, lungs, blood pressure, and abdominal region, did not speak  once. But when he turned him over, to see and feel the hole in Lane's  back, he exclaimed: \"My God, boy, what made this--a shell? I can put  my fist in it.\"    \"That's the bayonet jab.\"    Doctor Bronson cursed in a most undignified and unprofessional manner.  Then without further comment he went on and completed the examination.    \"That'll do,\" he said, and lent a hand while Lane put on his clothes.  It was then he noticed Lane's medal.    \"Ha! The _Croix de Guerre!_... Daren, I was a friend of your  father's. I _know_ how that medal would have made him feel. Tell me  what you did to get it?\"    \"Nothing much,\" replied Lane, stirred. \"It was in the Argonne, when we  took to open fighting. In fact I got most of my hurts there.... I  carried a badly wounded French officer back off the field. He was a  heavy man. That's where I injured my spine. I had to run with him. And  worse luck, he was dead when I got him back. But I didn't know that.\"    \"So the French decorated you, hey?\" asked the doctor, leaning back  with hands on hips, and keenly eyeing Lane.    \"Yes.\"    \"Why did not the American Army give you equal honor?\"    \"Well, for one thing it was never reported. And besides, it wasn't  anything any other fellow wouldn't do.\"    Doctor Bronson dropped his head and paced to and fro. Then the  door-bell rang in the reception room.    \"Daren Lane,\" began the doctor, suddenly stopping before Lane, \"I'd  hesitate to ask most men if they wanted the truth. To many men I'd  lie. But I know a few words from me can't faze you.\"    \"No, Doctor, one way or another it is all the same to me.\"    \"Well, boy, I can fix up that vertebra so it won't slip out again....  But, if there's anything in the world to save your life, I don't know  what it is.\"    \"Thank you, Doctor. It's--something to know--what to expect,\" returned  Lane, with a smile.    \"You might live a year--and you might not.... You might improve. God  only knows. Miracles _do_ happen. Anyway, come back to see me.\"    Lane shook hands with him and went out, passing another patient in the  reception room. Then as Lane opened the door and stepped out upon the  porch he almost collided with a girl who evidently had been about to  come in.    \"I beg your----\" he began, and stopped. He knew this girl, but the  strained tragic shadow of her eyes was strikingly unfamiliar. The  transparent white skin let"]]]
