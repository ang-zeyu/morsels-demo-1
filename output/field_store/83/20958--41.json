But when the conscious mind is \"dead\" the  body may yet live as a vegetable lives, with all its distinctively human  functions lost. Motionless, save for the beating of the heart and the  reaction of the lungs to air, the body may still be alive, though the  mind long since has ceased all earthly activity.    So we discover that an organ of mind is an essential, here, to life of  mind, and that mind only can induce this organ to any action above the  vegetative stage. But, on the other hand, we find that life can exist  without conscious mind, even if untended by others, for a limited time.    If the direct nerve connections between the brain and the hand, the  brain and the foot, or the brain and the trunk are cut off, the mind  henceforth realizes nothing of that part except as the sense of sight  reports upon it; for the optic nerves relate the hand and mind, through  this sense, as truly as the motor nerves which carry the mind's message  for motion to the hand, and the sensory nerves which carry back to the  mind the hand's pain. But let the optic nerve be inert, the sensory and  motor connections broken between brain and hand, or foot and trunk, or  brain and trunk, and the hand or foot may be amputated and the mind  never sense the fact; the trunk may be severely injured and the mind be  serenely unconscious. So the brain in man is \"the one immediate bodily  condition of the mental operations.\" Take away all the brain and man's  body is a useless mass of protoplasm.    The brain's varied and intricate nerve connections with all parts of the  body, through nerves branching from the main trunks in the spinal cord,  we shall not discuss, for you know them through your study of anatomy.  For the purpose of our psychology we need consider only two of the main  divisions of the brain--the _cerebrum_, which includes what we call the  right and left hemispheres, and the _cerebellum_.      THE CEREBRUM OR FOREBRAIN    For convenience the various lobes of the cerebrum are known as frontal,  temporal, parietal, and occipital, according to the parts of the brain  referred to: as forehead, temples, crown, or occiput. The cerebellum, or  hind brain, is also divided into two hemispheres, and is situated behind  and below the hemispheres of the cerebrum.    A system of localization has been roughly mapped out, the result of  careful laboratory work on animals and of studying the loss of various  functions in human beings as related to the location of brain injuries.    From these experiments it seems proved that consciousness belongs only  to the cortex or surface of the upper brain, and that the vast realm of  the unconscious belongs to the lower brain centers. Hence the cortex is  the organ of consciousness, and the lower centers are the repository of  the unconscious until it again becomes conscious.    The motor zone of the cortex we now know to be situated in the  convolutions bordering the fissure of Rolando. Vision is evidently  excited from the occipital lobes, though not yet conclusively proved.  Smell, presumably, is located in the temporal lobes. Considered action  is directed from the upper hemispheres only. It is significant that the  hemispheres of the cerebrum are also accepted as the seat of memory for  man--that intellectual quality which makes him capable of acting from  absent stimuli, stimuli only present to memory; which makes it possible  for him to reason the present from the experiences of the past.    But in all animal life, except the higher forms, the control of action  is from the lower brain centers, centers which respond only to present  objects. With them memory, as man knows it, is lacking; but the  reactions of the past are indelibly imprinted upon motor nerves and  muscles, so that when the present object presses the button, as it  were, calling forth the experience of the race, the animal instinctively  reacts.    But of what use to man, then, are the lower brain centers?    In man, as in lower animals, they care for the vegetative functions of  life, so that our blood continues to circulate, the air enters and  leaves our lungs, digestion is carried on, with no assistance from the  upper centers, the hemispheres of the cerebrum being thus left free for  concentration on the external world of matter, which it can transform  into a world of thought.    It is the lower or vegetative brain that may still exist and keep life  intact when the functions of the cerebrum are destroyed. We can say,  then, of the brain as a whole that it is the organ of the mind, the  _sine qua non_ of the mind, the apparatus for the registration of sense  impressions. The senses themselves are the rudiments of mind, are the  means by which stimuli alighting on sense organs enter consciousness;  for the nerves of special sense immediately carry the impetus to the  brain, where it is recognized as the \"not me,\" the _something_  definitely affecting the _me_, and demanding reaction from the _me_.    The functions of the cerebrum we find grouping themselves in three  classes: _intellect_, _emotion_, and _volition_, more simply, thinking,  feeling, and willing; and we find no mental activity of the normal or  abnormal mind which will not fall into one of these groupings. This  does not mean that one part of the brain thinks, another part wills,  another part feels; for in the performance of any one of these functions  the mind acts as a whole. Our thinking or our willing may be permeated  with feeling, but the entire mind is simply reacting simultaneously upon  various stimuli.          CHAPTER V    THE NORMAL MIND      Mind, we found, is born in the form of consciousness when the outside  world impresses itself upon the brain-cells by way of the senses. This  consciousness, observation and experiment prove, is first a feeling one,  later a feeling-thinking-willing one. The mind, then, is really the  activity of the brain as it feels, as it thinks, as it wills. We express  this in descriptive terms when we speak of mind as the _flow of  consciousness_, the sum of all mental associations, conscious and  unconscious. For mind is never a final thing. Looking within at our own  mental processes we find that always our thought is just becoming  something else. We reach a conclusion, but it is not a resting place,  only a starting place for another. My thought was _that_ a moment ago,  but while it was _that_ it was becoming _this_, and even now it is  becoming something else.    Thinking is mind. Feeling is mind. Willing is mind. But for the sake of  clearness we speak of feeling, thinking, and willing as being functions  of mind. Mind acts by using these powers. But to what end does it act?  What purpose does it serve? For these functions are not the reasons of  being for the mind, even as motion--while the immediate purpose of the  locomotive--is not its chief end. The steam engine may stand in the same  spot while its wheels revolve madly; it may move along the tracks alone,  and accomplish nothing; or it may transport a great train of loaded  cars. Unless it moves to some definite point and carries merchandise or  people there, it is a useless, indeed, a dangerous invention. We find,  in fact, that it functions to the very definite end of taking man and  his chattels to specified places.    And so it is with the mind. If it is thinking and feeling and willing  only for the sake of exercising these mental powers, it might better not  be. But what end do we actually find these functions serving?    Mind, with its powers of thinking, feeling, and willing, gives an  external world of matter; an internal world of thought, and so relates  them to each other as to make them serve man's purposes. Thus these  functions exist for accomplishment.    In the solving of a problem, for instance, the mind thinks, primarily;  in the enjoyment of music it feels, primarily, though its feeling may be  determined by the intellectual verdict on the music; in forcing its  owner to sit at the piano and practice in the face of strong desire to  attend the theater, it wills, primarily. Now one of its functions  predominates; now another. But the whole mind, not a feeling section, or  a thinking section, or a willing section, operates together to produce  action. When I play the piano it calls on all my mind. I think the  music. I feel it. I make my fingers play it. But the thinking, the  feeling, and the willing act together to result in the fingers playing.    The mind, then, is an instrument of achievement. It fulfils its purpose  when it makes matter serve useful ends.    _Emotion_ or _feeling_ is the function of the mind which associates a  sense of pleasure or pain with every thought or act.    Feeling is the affective state of mind. By this we mean that it has the  power to move us. And this emotion primarily does; for our feeling of  pleasure or pain moves us to action, as well as precedes and accompanies  and follows action. The word _emotion_ is usually employed to denote an  acute feeling state, while the word _mood_ denotes a prolonged feeling  condition, _i. e._, a less acute emotional state. The word _feeling_,  however, is used to cover both; for in each case the sensational element  manifests itself in a definite physical affect, pleasurable or painful  in some degree.    _Thinking_ is a conscious mental activity exercised to evolve ideas from  perceptions, and to combine and compare these ideas to form judgments.    Intellection, or thinking, might be explained as the mental process  which converts sensation into percepts, groups percepts to form concepts  or ideas, stores away ideas and sensations for future use, and recalls  them when needed--the recalling being memory--and by reason combines,  compares, and associates ideas to form judgments, then compares  judgments to form new judgments. The process of intellect we name by  terms denoting activity, such as intellection, thinking, the _stream of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#6)"],[1,"rnese, and the  Palazzo Veneziano were all built mainly from the plunder of the  Coliseum; and meaner robbers emulated the rapacity of their betters, by  burning into lime the fragments not available for architectural  purposes.    The material of which the Coliseum was built is exactly fitted to the  purposes of a great ruin. It is travertine, of a rich, dark, warm color,  deepened and mellowed by time. There is nothing glaring, harsh, or  abrupt in the harmony of tints. The blue sky above, and the green earth  beneath, are in unison with a tone of coloring not unlike the brown of  one of our own early winter landscapes. The travertine is also of a  coarse grain and porous texture, not splintering into points and edges,  but gradually corroding by natural decay. Stone of such a texture  everywhere opens laps and nooks for the reception and formation of soil.  Every grain of dust that is borne through the air by the lazy breeze of  summer, instead of sliding from a glassy surface, is held where it  falls. The rocks themselves crumble and decompose, and turn into a  fertile mold. Thus, the Coliseum is throughout crowned and draped with a  covering of earth, in many places of considerable depth. Trailing plants  clasp the stones with arms of verdure; wild flowers bloom in their  seasons; and long grass nods and waves on the airy battlements. Life has  everywhere sprouted from the trunk of death. Insects hum and sport in  the sunshine; the burnished lizard darts like a tongue of green flame  along the walls; and birds make the hollow quarry overflow with their  songs. There is something beautiful and impressive in the contrast  between luxuriant life and the rigid skeleton upon which it rests.    As a matter of course, everybody goes to see the Coliseum by moonlight.  The great charm of the ruin under this condition is, that the  imagination is substituted for sight; and the mind for the eye. The  essential character of moonlight is hard rather than soft. The line  between light and shadow is sharply defined, and there is no gradation  of color. Blocks and walls of silver are bordered by, and spring out of,  chasms of blackness. But moonlight shrouds the Coliseum in mystery. It  opens deep vaults of gloom where the eye meets only an ebon wall, upon  which the fancy paints innumerable pictures in solemn, splendid, and  tragic colors. Shadowy forms of emperor and lictor and vestal virgin and  gladiator and martyr come out of the darkness, and pass before us in  long and silent procession. The breezes which blow through the broken  arches are changed into voices, and recall the shouts and cries of a  vast audience. By day, the Coliseum is an impressive fact; by night, it  is a stately vision. By day, it is a lifeless form; by night, a vital  thought.    The Coliseum should by all means be seen by a bright starlight, or under  the growing sickle of a young moon. The fainter ray and deeper gloom  bring out more strongly its visionary and ideal character. When the full  moon has blotted out the stars, it fills the vast gulf of the building  with a flood of spectral light, which falls with a chilling touch upon  the spirit; for then the ruin is like a \"corpse in its shroud of snow,\"  and the moon is a pale watcher by its side. But when the walls, veiled  in deep shadow, seem a part of the darkness in which they are lost--when  the stars are seen through their chasms and breaks, and sparkle along  the broken line of the battlements--the scene becomes another, tho the  same; more indistinct, yet not so mournful; contracting the sphere of  sight, but enlarging that of thought; less burdening, but more  suggestive.    But under all aspects, in the blaze of noon, at sunset, by the light of  the moon or stars--the Coliseum stands alone and unapproached. It is the  monarch of ruins. It is a great tragedy in stone, and it softens and  subdues the mind like a drama of Aeschylus or Shakespeare. It is a  colossal type of those struggles of humanity against an irresistible  destiny, in which the tragic poet finds the elements of his art. The  calamities which crusht the house of Atreus are symbolized in its broken  arches and shattered walls. Built of the most durable materials, and  seemingly for eternity--of a size, material, and form to defy the  \"strong hours\" which conquer all, it has bowed its head to their touch,  and passed into the inevitable cycle of decay. \"And this too shall pass  away\"--which the Eastern monarch engraved upon his signet ring--is  carved upon these Cyclopean blocks. The stones of the Coliseum were once  water; and they are now turning into dust. Such is ever the circle of  nature. The solid is changing into the fluid, and the fluid into the  solid; and that which is unseen is alone indestructible. He does not see  the Coliseum aright who carries away from it no other impressions than  those of form, size, and hue. It speaks an intelligible language to the  wiser mind. It rebukes the peevish and consoles the patient. It teaches  us that there are misfortunes which are clothed with dignity, and  sorrows that are crowned with grandeur. As the same blue sky smiles upon  the ruin which smiled upon the perfect structure, so the same beneficent  Providence bends over our shattered hopes and our answered prayers.          THE PANTHEON[9]    BY GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD      The best preserved monument of ancient Rome, and one of the most  beautiful buildings of the modern city, is unhappily placed. The  Pantheon stands in a narrow and dirty piazza, and is shouldered and  elbowed by a mob of vulgar houses. There is no breathing-space around,  which it might penetrate with the light of its own serene beauty. Its  harmonious proportions can be seen only in front; and it has there the  disadvantage of being approached from a point higher than that on which  it stands. On one side is a market; and the space before the matchless  portico is strewn with fish-bones, decayed vegetables, and offal.[10]    Forsyth, the sternest and most fastidious of architectural critics, has  only \"large draughts of unqualified praise\" for the Pantheon; and, where  he finds nothing to censure, who will venture to do any thing but  commend? The character of the architecture, and the sense of  satisfaction which it leaves upon the mind, are proofs of the enduring  charm of simplicity. The portico is perfectly beautiful. It is one  hundred and ten feet long and forty-four deep, and rests upon sixteen  columns of the Corinthian order, the shafts being of granite and the  capitals of marble. Eight of these are in front, and of these eight,  there are four (including the two on the extreme right and left) which  have two others behind them; the portico being thus divided into three  portions, like the nave and side aisles of a cathedral; the middle  space, leading to the door, being wider than the others. The granite of  the shafts is partly gray and partly rose-colored, but, in the shadow in  which they stand, the difference of hue is hardly perceptible. The  proportions of these columns are faultless; and their massive shafts and  richly-carved capitals produce the effect, at once, of beauty and  sublimity. The pediment above is now a bald front of ragged stone, but  it was once adorned with bas-reliefs in bronze; and the holes, made by  the rivets with which they were fastened, are still to be seen.    The aisles of the portico were once vaulted with bronze, and massive  beams or slabs of the same metal stretched across the whole structure;  but this was removed by Urban VIII., and melted into a baldachino to  deface St. Peter's, and cannon to defend the castle of St. Angelo; and,  not content with this, he has added insult to injury, and commemorated  his robbery in a Latin inscription, in which he claims to be commended  as for a praiseworthy act. But even this is not the heaviest weight  resting on the memory of that vandal pope. He shares with Bernini the  reproach of having added those hideous belfries which now rise above  each end of the vestibule--as wanton and unprovoked an offense against  good taste as ever was committed. A cocked hat upon the statue of  Demosthenes in the Vatican would not be a more discordant addition. The  artist should have gone to the stake, before giving his hand to such a  piece of disfigurement.    The cell, or main portion of the building to which the portico is  attached, is a simple structure, circular in form, and built of brick.  It was formerly encrusted with marble. The cell and the portico stand to  each other in the most harmonious relation, altho it seems to be  admitted that the latter was an addition, not contemplated when the cell  was built. But in the combination there is nothing forced or unnatural,  and they seem as necessary and as preordained complements, one to the  other, as a fine face and a fine head. The cell is a type of masculine  dignity, and the portico, of feminine grace; and the result is a perfect  architectural union.    The interior--a rotunda, surmounted by a dome--is converted into a  Christian church, a purpose to which its form and structure are not well  adapted; and the altars and their accessories are not improvements in an  architectural point of view. But in spite of this--in spite of all that  it has suffered at the hands of rapacity and bad taste--tho the panels  of the majestic dome have been stript of their bronze, and the whole has  been daubed over with a glaring coat of whitewash--the interior still  remains, with all its rare beauty essentially unimpaired. And the reason  of this is that this charm is the result of form and proportion, and can  not be lost except by entire destruction. The only light which the  temple receives is from a circular opening of twenty-eight feet in  diameter at the top; and falling, as it does, directly from the sky, it  fills the whole space with the purity of the heavens themselves.
