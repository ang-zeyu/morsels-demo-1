It was likewise very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#6)"],[1,"uniform as that of a waltz in the ball-room, in playing an adagio  he appears to have allowed his left hand some freedom of movement for  the sake of expression (see Jahn I., 134). Beethoven, according to  Seyfried, \"was very particular at rehearsals about the frequent  passages in _tempo rubato_;\" and there are other remarks by  contemporaries of Beethoven which indicate that although he wrote in  the classical style, in his playing and conducting he often introduced  a romantic _rubato_. Still, in the majority of his compositions, there  is no room for the _rubato_, which cannot be said to have found a home  in German music till it was assimilated by the Schumann school, under  the influence of Chopin. Since then, it has leavened the spirit of  modern music in a manner which has never been sufficiently emphasized.  I am convinced that even Richard Wagner was, unconsciously, influenced  by it through Liszt; for one of the chief peculiarities of his style  is a sort of dramatic _rubato_ which emancipates his music from the  tyranny of the strict dance measure. In his essay on the proper  interpretation of Tannhaeuser, Wagner declares that the division of  music into regular measures, or bars, is merely a mechanical means for  enabling the composer to convey his ideas to the singer. As soon as  the singer has grasped the idea, he says, the bar should be thrown  aside as a useless incumbrance, and the singer, ignoring strict time,  should be guided by his feelings alone, while the conductor should  follow and preserve harmony between him and the orchestra.    It might be said that this dramatic _rubato_ is something different  from Chopin's _rubato_. _Rubato_ literally means \"robbed,\" and it is  generally supposed that the peculiarity of Chopin's style consisted  simply in this, that he prolonged certain notes in a bar at the  expense of the others--robbing from one what he gave to his neighbor.  But this is a very inadequate conception of the term. Chopin's  _rubato_ means much more than this. It includes, to a large extent,  the frequent unexpected changes of time and rhythm, together with the  _ritardandos_ and _accelerandos_. It includes, secondly, those unique  passages, first conceived by Chopin, where the right hand has to play  irregular groups of small notes--say twenty-two, while the left hand  plays only twelve; or nineteen, while the left plays four--passages in  which Chopin indicated as clearly as Wagner did in the words just  quoted that the musical bar is a mere mechanical measure which does  not sufficiently indicate the phrasing of the romantic or dramatic  ideas that lie beyond the walls of a dance-hall.    There is a third peculiarity of Chopin's style which may be included  under the name of _rubato_, namely, his habit of \"robbing\" the note,  not of its duration, but its _accent_. Every student of music knows  that the symphony and sonata are called \"idealized dance forms,\"  because they are direct outgrowths of the dances that were cultivated  originally in Italy, France, and Germany. Now, one peculiarity of  these dances is the fact that the accent always falls on the first  beat of each bar. This is very appropriate and convenient for dancing,  but from an artistic point of view, it is decidedly monotonous. Hence,  Chopin conferred a vast benefit on modern art by introducing the  spirit of Slavic music, in which the accent often falls on other beats  beside the first. These regular accents produce the effect of the  variable _tempo rubato_, and it is to them that Chopin's works largely  owe their exotic, poetic color. As they open up new possibilities of  emotional expression, they have been eagerly appropriated by other  composers and have leavened all modern music. To Chopin, therefore,  chiefly belongs the honor of having emancipated music from the  monotony of the Western European dance-beat by means of the _tempo  rubato_ in its varied aspects.    But, it was not merely in the accent of the dance forms, that he  introduced an agreeable innovation; he was one of the giants who helped  to create a new epoch in art, by breaking these old forms altogether,  and substituting new ones better suited to modern tastes. And here we  come across one of the most ludicrous misconceptions which have been  fostered concerning Chopin by shallow critics, and which brings us back  again for a moment to the question of Jumboism. I do not know whether  he was a German or a French critic who first wrote that Chopin,  although great in short pieces, was not great enough to master the  sonata form. Once in print, this silly opinion was repeated parrot-like  by scores of other critics. _How_ silly it is may be inferred from the  fact that such third-rate composerlings as Herz and Hummel were able to  write sonatas of the most approved pattern--and that, in fact, _any_  person with the least musical talent can learn in a few years to write  sonatas that are absolutely correct as regards form. And yet we are  asked to believe that Chopin, one of the most profound and original  musical thinkers the world has ever seen, could not write a correct  sonata! _Risum teneatis amici_! Chopin not able to master the sonata  form? The fact is, _the sonata form could not master him_. He felt  instinctively that it was too artificial to serve as a vehicle for the  expression of poetic thought; and his thoroughly original genius  therefore created the more plastic and malleable shorter forms which  have since been adopted by composers the world over. The few sonatas  which Chopin wrote do not deviate essentially from the orthodox  structure, but one feels constantly that he was hampered in his  movements by the artificial structure. Though they are full of genius,  like everything he composed, he did not write them _con amore_.  Concentration is one of Chopin's principal characteristics, and the  sonata favors diffuseness. Too much thematic beating out is the bane of  the sonata. A few bars of gold are worth more than many square yards of  gold leaf; and Chopin's bars are solid gold. Moreover, there is no  organic unity between the different parts of the sonata, whatever may  have been said to the contrary. The essentially artificial character of  the sonata is neatly illustrated by a simile used by Dr. Hanslick in  speaking of Chopin. \"This composer,\" he said, \"although highly and  peculiarly gifted, was never able to unite the fragrant flowers which  he scattered by handfuls, into beautiful wreaths.\" Dr. Hanslick intends  this as censure. I regard it as the greatest compliment he could have  paid him. A wreath may be very pretty in its way, but it is artificial.  The flowers are crushed and their fragrance does not blend. How much  lovelier is a single violet or orchid in the fields, unhampered by  strings and wires, and connected solely with its stalk and the  surrounding green leaves. Many of Chopin's compositions are so short  that they can hardly be likened unto flowers, but only to buds. Yet is  not a rosebud a thousand times more beautiful than a full-blown rose?    One more consideration. The psychology of the sonata form is false.  Men and women do not feel happy for ten minutes as in the opening  allegro of a sonata, then melancholy for another ten minutes, as in  the following adagio, then frisky, as in the scherzo, and finally,  fiery and impetuous for ten minutes as in the finale. The movements of  our minds are seldom so systematic as this. Sad and happy thoughts and  moods chase one another incessantly and irregularly, as they do in the  compositions of Chopin, which, therefore, are much truer echoes of our  modern romantic feelings than the stiff and formal classical sonatas.  And thus it is, that Chopin's habitual neglect of the sonata form,  instead of being a defect, reveals his rare artistic subtlety and  grandeur. It was natural that a Pole should vindicate for music this  emotional freedom of movement, for the Slavic mind is especially prone  to constant changes of mood. Nevertheless, as soon as Chopin had shown  the way, other composers followed eagerly in the new path, and in the  present day the sonata may be regarded as obsolete. Few contemporary  composers have written more than one or two--merely in order to show  that they can do so if they want to; and even Brahms, the high priest  of the conservatives, has, in his later period, devoted himself more  and more exclusively to shorter modern forms in his pianoforte music.    Strictly speaking, Chopin was not the first who tried to get away from  the sonata. Beethoven, though he remained faithful to it, felt its  fetters, as is shown by his numerous poetic licenses. Schubert wrote  \"Moments Musicals,\" Mendelssohn, \"Songs without Words,\" Weber,  Polonaises, and Field, Nocturnes. But these were merely straws which  indicated in which direction Chopin's genius would sweep the field and  clear the musical atmosphere. His polonaises and nocturnes are vastly  superior to those of Weber and Field; and his poetic preludes, his  romantic ballads, his lovely berceuse, his amorous mazurkas, are new  types in art which have often been imitated but never equalled. Only  in one field did Chopin have a dangerous rival among his predecessors,  namely, in the Waltz. Weber's \"Invitation to the Dance\" is the source  of the modern idealized waltz, because it was not written for the feet  alone, but also for the heart and the imagination. Like Chopin's  waltzes, it contains chivalrous passages, amorous episodes, and subtle  changes of movement. And it seems as if the fact that there was less  room for formal and emotional innovations in the waltz than in the  other forms, had somewhat affected Chopin's imagination. For, although  the most popular of his works, his waltzes are, with a few exceptions  in which the _rubato_ prevails, less characteristic than his other  pieces. Nevertheless, they are charming, every one of them. But they  are fairy dances--mortals"]]]
