The expansion cannot be great at this part of the chest, as the side  is so short a distance from the backbone to which the ribs are  attached. The movement of the ribs in front is much greater, as Fig. 9  shows.    Figure 11 shows the front expansion and contraction in the breathing  of the female, side view.    Figure 12 shows the lateral expansion of the chest in the female,  front view.    These diagrams are made from photographs, and thus true to life. It  will be noticed that there is no difference in the breathing outline  between these subjects. The female subject, though a good singer, had  had no training in breathing. She previously insisted that she used  only the chest breathing, and did not use the abdominal muscles, but  actual test revealed the condition to be that shown in Figure 11 and  convinced her that she was mistaken.    [Illustration: FIGURE 9.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 10.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 11.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 12.]    It is not unlikely that many other singers who now think they are  using only the high chest respiration would, if subjected to the same  test, find themselves similarly mistaken.    The contraction incident to forced expiration is much more tense than  the enlargement of forced inspiration. When singing or speaking,  forced inspiration is not used. Experience shows that the change in  size of the body during speaking or singing is usually small.  Occasionally, long passages in music demand that the expulsive power  of the breathing apparatus be used to its limit.      ECONOMY OF BREATH    The quantity of air taken in with a single inspiration is, in quiet  breathing, according to Prof. Mills,[3] from twenty to thirty cubic  inches, but this may be increased in the deepest inspiration to about  one hundred cubic inches. In forcible expiration about one hundred  cubic inches may be expelled, but even then the residual air that  cannot be expelled is about one hundred cubic inches.    [Footnote 3: Dr. Wesley Mills, _Voice Production_, 1906.]    It is not, however, the quantity of breath inhaled that is  significant, it is the amount _controlled_. Get, therefore, all the  breath necessary, and keep it, but without undue effort and _without  rigidity_.    To test the amount of breath used in prolonged vocalization, a person  skilled in the art of breathing, after an ordinary inspiration, closed  his lips, stopped his nostrils, and began to vocalize. He found that  the mouth with distended cheeks held sufficient breath to continue a  substantial tone for twenty-three seconds.    While these experiments show that very little amount or force of  breath is needed to produce effective tones, the impression must exist  in the mind of the performer that there is a free flow of breath  through the larynx; otherwise the tone will seem restricted and will  be weak. The forced holding back of the breath begets a restraint that  has a bad effect on the singer's delivery. While the breath must be  controlled, there is such a thing as an exaggerated \"breath control\"  that makes free delivery of the voice impossible.    It is quite possible to _overcrowd_ the lungs with air. Do not,  therefore, make the mistake of always taking the largest possible  breath. Reserve this for the climaxes, and inhale according to the  requirements of the phrase and its dynamics. The constant taking of  too much breath is a common mistake, but trying to sing too long on  one breath is another.      THE INITIAL USE OF BREATH FORCE    The breath force when properly employed seems to be expended in  starting the vibrations in the larynx; the vibrations are then  transmitted to the air in the resonance cavities, and there the  perfected tone sets the outer air in motion, through which the tone  vibrations are conveyed to the ear of the listener.      RESERVE BREATH POWER    The correctly trained singer or speaker will never allow the breath  power to be exhausted. Some breath should be taken in at every  convenient interval between the words, according to the punctuation,  but never between syllables of a word; this is correct phrasing. In  this way the lungs are kept nearly full, and breathing is at its best.    The chief cause of breath exhaustion is _wasted_ breath. This waste  comes from exhaling more breath (more motive power) than the tone  requires, and _breath that does not become tone is wasted_. This fault  is largely induced by lack of proper resonance adjustment.    The singer should always feel able to sing another note or to speak  another word. To sing or speak thirty or forty counts with one breath  is useful practice but poor performance. Occasionally, long runs in  singing may compel an exception. Half-empty lungs lower the pitch of  the tone, lessen the resonance, and weaken the voice, rendering the  last note of the song and the last word of the sentence inaudible. The  breathing must not be forced, but enough air must be furnished to  produce the proper full vibrations.      BREATH MASTERY    What then does perfect control of the breath mean?    1. Ability to fill the lungs to their capacity either quickly or  slowly.    2. Ability to breathe out as quickly or slowly as the occasion  demands.    3. Ability to suspend inspiration, with the throat open, whether the  lungs are full or not, and to resume the process at will without  having lost any of the already inspired air.    4. Ability to exhale under the same restrictions.    The above four points are common to speaking and singing, but singing  involves further:    5. Ability to sing and sustain the voice on an _ordinary_ breath.    6. Ability to _quietly_ breathe as often as text and phrase permit.    7. Ability to breathe so that the fullest inspiration _brings no  fatigue_.    8. Ability to so economize the breath that the _reserve is never  exhausted_.    9. The ability to breathe so naturally, so unobtrusively, that  _neither breath nor lack of breath is ever suggested to the  listener_--this is the very perfection of the art.          CHAPTER IV    BREATHING EXERCISES      Enough has been said in the preceding chapter to make clear the  necessity of breath control, and to show what constitutes this control  for the singer--the professional breather.    If the singer's breathing is nothing but an amplification of normal,  healthy breathing, why dwell upon it, why not let it develop of  itself?    Unfortunately, many teachers have taken this attitude, overlooking the  fact that, although life is dependent on normal, healthy breathing,  such breathing is, in civilized communities, not the rule but the  exception, simply because normal living is rare; the artificiality of  modern life forbids it. The high pressure under which most people live  induces mental tension together with the consequent nervous and  muscular tension. We are, without being conscious of it, so habituated  to unnatural tension that automatic breathing is shallow and irregular  instead of being deep and rhythmic.    The task, therefore, is to reclaim a neglected birthright--natural  breathing--to make it habitual and amplify it.      PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS    1. Breathing exercises to be invigorating and purifying demand plenty  of fresh air.    2. At first do not practise longer than ten minutes at a time, three  times a day.    3. Gradually lengthen the time without overdoing. When tired stop.    4. The best time is before dressing in the morning, with the window  open. The worst time is directly after a meal.    5. Maintain throughout an easy, flexible poise.    6. Breathe as _deeply_ as possible without abdominal distention. The  greatest expansion should be felt at the lower end of the breast-bone.    7. Breathe as _broadly_ as possible, expanding the sides without  tension.    8. Breathe as _high_ as possible without shoulder movement or  stiffness.    9. Use not the high breath alone, or the mid-breath, or the low  breath, but use the _complete_ breath.    10. Breathe _rhythmically_ by counting mentally.    11. Breathe _thoughtfully_ rather than mechanically.    12. Do not crowd the lungs or lay stress on the mere quantity of air  you can inhale. The intake of breath is, for the singer, secondary to  its control, economy, and application in song. Increase of lung  capacity will duly appear.    13. When not singing, speaking or practising an exercise that demands  it, _keep your mouth shut_.      ATTITUDE    Dress the neck and body loosely, so as to give the throat and trunk  perfect freedom. Place the hands on the hips, so as to free the chest  from the weight of the arms. Stand erect, evenly upon the balls of the  feet; the body straight, but not strained. Raise the back of the head  slightly without bending the neck. This action will straighten the  spine, place the chest forward, and bring the abdomen backward into  its proper relation.    The great majority of people are shallow breathers, chest breathers,  who when told to take a \"deep breath\" do not know what is meant. It is  therefore necessary for them first to learn what a deep breath is, and  then how to take it.      Exercise I    FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT A DEEP BREATH IS    Before rising in the morning, remove your pillow and while flat on  your back place one hand lightly on the abdomen, the other on the  lower ribs. Relax the whole body, giving up your whole weight to the  bed. Inhale through the nostrils slowly, evenly, and deeply, while  mentally counting one, two, three, four, etc. As you inhale, notice  (_a_) the gradual expansion of the abdomen, (_b_) the side expansion  of the lower ribs, (_c_) the rise and inflation of the chest, without  raising the shoulders. Hold the breath while mentally counting four  (four seconds), then suddenly let the breath go, and notice the  collapse of the abdomen and lower chest.

Out from the shadows staggered a ghastly  figure--that of a man whose face appeared to be _streaked_. His eyes  glared at me madly, and he moved the air with his hands like one blind  and insane with fear.    I started back; words died upon my tongue. The figure reeled, and the  man fell babbling and sobbing at my very feet.    Inert I stood, looking down at him. He writhed a moment--and was  still. The silence again became perfect. Then, from somewhere beyond  the elms, Nayland Smith appeared. I did not move. Even when he stood  beside me, I merely stared at him fatuously.    \"I let him walk to his death, Petrie,\" I heard dimly. \"God forgive  me--God forgive me!\"    The words aroused me.    \"Smith\"--my voice came as a whisper--\"for one awful moment I  thought--\"    \"So did some one else,\" he rapped. \"Our poor sailor has met the end  designed for _me_, Petrie!\"    At that I realized two things: I knew why Forsyth's face had struck me  as being familiar in some puzzling way, and I knew why Forsyth now lay  dead upon the grass. Save that he was a fair man and wore a slight  moustache, he was, in features and build, the double of Nayland Smith!          CHAPTER V    THE NET      We raised the poor victim and turned him over on his back. I dropped  upon my knees, and with unsteady fingers began to strike a match. A  slight breeze was arising and sighing gently through the elms, but,  screened by my hands, the flame of the match took life. It illuminated  wanly the sun-baked face of Nayland Smith, his eyes gleaming with  unnatural brightness. I bent forward, and the dying light of the match  touched that other face.    \"Oh, God!\" whispered Smith.    A faint puff of wind extinguished the match.    In all my surgical experience I had never met with anything quite so  horrible. Forsyth's livid face was streaked with tiny streams of  blood, which proceeded from a series of irregular wounds. One group of  these clustered upon his left temple, another beneath his right eye,  and others extended from the chin down to the throat. They were  black, almost like tattoo marks, and the entire injured surface was  bloated indescribably. His fists were clenched; he was quite rigid.    Smith's piercing eyes were set upon me eloquently as I knelt on the  path and made my examination--an examination which that first glimpse  when Forsyth came staggering out from the trees had rendered  useless--a mere matter of form.    \"He's quite dead, Smith,\" I said huskily. \"It's--unnatural--it--\"    Smith began beating his fist into his left palm and taking little,  short, nervous strides up and down beside the dead man. I could hear a  car skirling along the high-road, but I remained there on my knees  staring dully at the disfigured bloody face which but a matter of  minutes since had been that of a clean-looking British seaman. I found  myself contrasting his neat, squarely trimmed moustache with the  bloated face above it, and counting the little drops of blood which  trembled upon its edge. There were footsteps approaching. I arose. The  footsteps quickened, and I turned as a constable ran up.    \"What's this?\" he demanded gruffly, and stood with his fists clenched,  looking from Smith to me and down at that which lay between us. Then  his hand flew to his breast; there was a silvern gleam and--    \"Drop that whistle!\" snapped Smith, and struck it from the man's hand.  \"Where's your lantern? Don't ask questions!\"    The constable started back and was evidently debating upon his chances  with the two of us, when my friend pulled a letter from his pocket and  thrust it under the man's nose.    \"Read that!\" he directed harshly, \"and then listen to my orders.\"    There was something in his voice which changed the officer's opinion  of the situation. He directed the light of his lantern upon the open  letter, and seemed to be stricken with wonder.    \"If you have any doubt,\" continued Smith--\"you may not be familiar  with the Commissioner's signature--you have only to ring up Scotland  Yard from Dr. Petrie's house, to which we shall now return to disperse  it.\" He pointed to Forsyth. \"Help us to carry him there. We must not  be seen; this must be hushed up. You understand? It must not get into  the Press--\"    The man saluted respectfully, and the three of us addressed ourselves  to the mournful task. By slow stages we bore the dead man to the edge  of the common, carried him across the road and into my house, without  exciting attention even on the part of those vagrants who nightly  slept out in the neighbourhood.    We laid our burden upon the surgery table.    \"You will want to make an examination, Petrie,\" said Smith in his  decisive way, \"and the officer here might 'phone for the ambulance. I  have some investigations to make also. I must have the pocket lamp.\"    He raced upstairs to his room, and an instant later came running down  again. The front door banged.    \"The telephone is in the hall,\" I said to the constable.    \"Thank you, sir.\"    He went out of the surgery as I switched on the lamp over the table  and began to examine the marks upon Forsyth's skin. These, as I have  said, were in groups and nearly all in the form of elongated  punctures; a fairly deep incision with a pear-shaped and superficial  scratch beneath it. One of the tiny wounds had penetrated the right  eye.    The symptoms, or those which I had been enabled to observe as Forsyth  had first staggered into view from among the elms, were most puzzling.  Clearly enough the muscles of articulation and the respiratory  muscles had been affected; and now the livid face, dotted over with  tiny wounds (they were also on the throat), set me mentally groping  for a clue to the manner of his death.    No clue presented itself; and my detailed examination of the body  availed me nothing. The grey herald of dawn was come when the police  arrived with the ambulance and took Forsyth away.    I was just taking my cap from the rack when Nayland Smith returned.    \"Smith!\" I cried, \"have you found anything?\"    He stood there in the grey light of the hall-way tugging at the lobe  of his left ear.    The bronzed face looked very gaunt, I thought, and his eyes were  bright with that febrile glitter which once I had disliked, but which  I had learned from experience to be due to tremendous nervous  excitement. At such times he could act with icy coolness, and his  mental faculties seemed temporarily to acquire an abnormal keenness.  He made no direct reply, but--    \"Have you any milk?\" he jerked abruptly.    So wholly unexpected was the question that for a moment I failed to  grasp it. Then--    \"Milk!\" I began.    \"Exactly, Petrie! If you can find me some milk, I shall be obliged.\"    I turned to descend to the kitchen, when--    \"The remains of the turbot from dinner, Petrie, would also be welcome,  and I think I should like a trowel.\"    I stopped at the stairhead and faced him.    \"I cannot suppose that you are joking, Smith,\" I said, \"but--\"    He laughed dryly.    \"Forgive me, old man,\" he replied. \"I was so preoccupied with my own  train of thought that it never occurred to me how absurd my request  must have sounded. I will explain my singular tastes later; at the  moment, hustle is the watchword.\"    Evidently he was in earnest, and I ran downstairs accordingly,  returning with a garden trowel, a plate of cold fish, and a glass of  milk.    \"Thanks, Petrie,\" said Smith. \"If you would put the milk in a jug--\"    I was past wondering, so I simply went and fetched a jug, into which  he poured the milk. Then, with the trowel in his pocket, the plate of  cold turbot in one hand and the milk-jug in the other, he made for the  door. He had it open, when another idea evidently occurred to him.    \"I'll trouble you for the pistol, Petrie.\"    I handed him the pistol without a word.    \"Don't assume that I want to mystify you,\" he added, \"but the presence  of any one else might jeopardize my plan. I don't expect to be long.\"    The cold light of dawn flooded the hall-way momentarily; then the door  closed again and I went upstairs to my study, watching Nayland Smith  as he strode across the common in the early morning mist. He was  making for the Nine Elms, but I lost sight of him before he reached  them.    I sat there for some time, watching for the first glow of sunrise. A  policeman tramped past the house, and, a while later, a belated  reveller in evening clothes. That sense of unreality assailed me  again. Out there in the grey mist a man who was vested with powers  which rendered him a law unto himself, who had the British Government  behind him in all that he might choose to do, who had been summoned  from Rangoon to London on singular and dangerous business, was  employing himself with a plate of cold turbot, a jug of milk, and a  trowel!    Away to the right, and just barely visible, a tramcar stopped by the  common, then proceeded on its way, coming in a westerly direction. Its  lights twinkled yellowly through the greyness, but I was less  concerned with the approaching car than with the solitary traveller  who had descended from it.    As the car went rocking by below me I strained my eyes in an endeavour  more clearly to discern the figure, which, leaving the high-road, had  struck-out across the common. It was that of a woman, who seemingly  carried a bulky bag or parcel.    One must be a gross materialist to doubt that there are latent powers  in man which man, in modern times, neglects or knows not how to  develop. I became suddenly conscious of a burning curiosity respecting  this lonely traveller who travelled at an hour so strange. With no  definite plan in mind, I went downstairs, took a cap from the rack and  walked briskly out of"]]]
