Ernest listened to the words of his own play coming from the older man's  mouth. The horrible fascination of the scene held him entranced. He saw  the creations of his mind pass in review before him, as a man might look  upon the face of his double grinning at him from behind a door in the  hideous hours of night.    They were all there! The mad king. The subtle-witted courtiers. The  sombre-hearted Prince. The Queen-Mother who had loved a jester better  than her royal mate, and the fruit of their shameful alliance, the  Princess Marigold, a creature woven of sunshine and sin.    Swiftly the action progressed. Shadows of impending death darkened the  house of the King. In the horrible agony of the rack the old jester  confessed. Stripped of his cap and bells, crowned with a wreath of  blood, he looked so pathetically funny that the Princess Marigold could  not help laughing between her tears.    The Queen stood there all trembling and pale. Without a complaint she  saw her lover die. The executioner's sword smote the old man's head  straight from the trunk. It rolled at the feet of the King, who tossed  it to Marigold. The little Princess kissed it and covered the grinning  horror with her yellow veil.    The last words died away.    There was no applause. Only silence. All were stricken with the dread  that men feel in the house of God or His awful presence in genius.    But the boy lay back in his chair. The cold sweat had gathered on his  brow and his temples throbbed. Nature had mercifully clogged his head  with blood. The rush of it drowned the crying voice of the nerves,  deadening for a while both consciousness and pain.          XII      Somehow the night had passed--somehow in bitterness, in anguish. But it  had passed.    Ernest's lips were parched and sleeplessness had left its trace in the  black rings under the eyes, when the next morning he confronted Reginald  in the studio.    Reginald was sitting at the writing-table in his most characteristic  pose, supporting his head with his hand and looking with clear piercing  eyes searchingly at the boy.    \"Yes,\" he observed, \"it's a most curious psychical phenomenon.\"    \"You cannot imagine how real it all seemed to me.\"    The boy spoke painfully, dazed, as if struck by a blow.    \"Even now it is as if something has gone from me, some struggling  thought that I cannot--cannot remember.\"    Reginald regarded him as a physical experimenter might look upon the  subject of a particularly baffling mental disease.    \"You must not think, my boy, that I bear you any malice for your  extraordinary delusion. Before Jack went away he gave me an exact  account of all that has happened. Divers incidents recurred to him from  which it appears that, at various times in the past, you have been on  the verge of a nervous collapse.\"    A nervous collapse! What was the use of this term but a euphemism for  insanity?    \"Do not despair, dear child,\" Reginald caressingly remarked. \"Your  disorder is not hopeless, not incurable. Such crises come to every man  who writes. It is the tribute we pay to the Lords of Song. The  minnesinger of the past wrote with his heart's blood; but we moderns dip  our pen into the sap of our nerves. We analyse life, love art--and the  dissecting knife that we use on other men's souls finally turns against  ourselves.    \"But what shall a man do? Shall he sacrifice art to hygiene and  surrender the one attribute that makes him chiefest of created things?  Animals, too, think. Some walk on two legs. But introspection  differentiates man from the rest. Shall we yield up the sweet  consciousness of self that we derive from the analysis of our emotion,  for the contentment of the bull that ruminates in the shade of a tree or  the healthful stupidity of a mule?\"    \"Assuredly not.\"    \"But what shall a man do?\"    \"Ah, that I cannot tell. Mathematics offers definite problems that admit  of a definite solution. Life states its problems with less exactness and  offers for each a different solution. One and one are two to-day and  to-morrow. Psychical values, on each manipulation, will yield a  different result. Still, your case is quite clear. You have overworked  yourself in the past, mentally and emotionally. You have sown unrest,  and must not be surprised if neurasthenia is the harvest thereof.\"    \"Do you think--that I should go to some sanitarium?\" the boy falteringly  asked.    \"God forbid! Go to the seashore, somewhere where you can sleep and play.  Take your body along, but leave your brain behind--at least do not  take more of it with you than is necessary. The summer season in  Atlantic City has just begun. There, as everywhere in American society,  you will be much more welcome if you come without brains.\"    Reginald's half-bantering tone reassured Ernest a little. Timidly he  dared approach once more the strange event that had wrought such havoc  with his nervous equilibrium.    \"How do you account for my strange obsession--one might almost call it a  mania?\"    \"If it could be accounted for it would not be strange.\"    \"Can you suggest no possible explanation?\"    \"Perhaps a stray leaf on my desk a few indications of the plot, a  remark--who knows? Perhaps thought-matter is floating in the air.  Perhaps--but we had better not talk of it now. It would needlessly  excite you.\"    \"You are right,\" answered Ernest gloomily, \"let us not talk of it. But  whatever may be said, it is a marvellous play.\"    \"You flatter me. There is nothing in it that you may not be able to do  equally well--some day.\"    \"Ah, no,\" the boy replied, looking up to Reginald with admiration. \"You  are the master.\"          XIII      Lazily Ernest stretched his limbs on the beach of Atlantic City. The  sea, that purger of sick souls, had washed away the fever and the fret  of the last few days. The wind was in his hair and the spray was in his  breath, while the rays of the sun kissed his bare arms and legs. He  rolled over in the glittering sand in the sheer joy of living.    Now and then a wavelet stole far into the beach, as if to caress him,  but pined away ere it could reach its goal. It was as if the enamoured  sea was stretching out its arms to him. Who knows, perhaps through the  clear water some green-eyed nymph, or a young sea-god with the tang of  the sea in his hair, was peering amorously at the boy's red mouth. The  people of the deep love the red warm blood of human kind. It is always  the young that they lure to their watery haunts, never the shrivelled  limbs that totter shivering to the grave.    Such fancies came to Ernest as he lay on the shore in his bathing  attire, happy, thoughtless,--animal.    The sun and the sea seemed to him two lovers vying for his favor. The  sudden change of environment had brought complete relaxation and had  quieted his rebellious, assertive soul. He was no longer a solitary unit  but one with wind and water, herb and beach and shell. Almost  voluptuously his hand toyed with the hot sand that glided caressingly  through his fingers and buried his breast and shoulder under its  glittering burden.    A summer girl who passed lowered her eyes coquettishly. He watched her  without stirring. Even to open his mouth or to smile would have seemed  too much exertion.    Thus he lay for hours. When at length noon drew nigh, it cost him a  great effort of will to shake off his drowsy mood and exchange his airy  costume for the conventional habilaments of the dining-room.    He had taken lodgings in a fashionable hotel. An unusual stroke of good  luck, hack-work that paid outrageously well, had made it possible for  him to idle for a time without a thought of the unpleasant necessity of  making money.    One single article to which he signed his name only with reluctance had  brought to him more gear than a series of golden sonnets.    \"Surely,\" he thought, \"the social revolution ought to begin from above.  What right has the bricklayer to grumble when he receives for a week's  work almost more than I for a song?\"    Thus soliloquising, he reached the dining-room. The scene that unfolded  itself before him was typical--the table over-loaded, the women  over-dressed.    The luncheon was already in full course when he came. He mumbled an  apology and seated himself on the only remaining chair next to a youth  who reminded him of a well-dressed dummy. With slight weariness his eyes  wandered in all directions for more congenial faces when they were  arrested by a lady on the opposite side of the table. She was clad in a  silk robe with curiously embroidered net-work that revealed a nervous  and delicate throat. The rich effect of the net-work was relieved by the  studied simplicity with which her heavy chestnut-colored hair was  gathered in a single knot. Her face was turned away from him, but there  was something in the carriage of her head that struck him as familiar.  When at last she looked him in the face, the glass almost fell from his  hand: it was Ethel Brandenbourg. She seemed to notice his embarrassment  and smiled. When she opened her lips to speak, he knew by the haunting  sweetness of the voice that he was not mistaken.    \"Tell me,\" she said wistfully, \"you have forgotten me? They all have.\"    He hastened to assure her that he had not forgotten her. He recollected  now that he had first been introduced to her in Walkham's house some  years ago, when a mere college boy, he had been privileged to attend one  of that master's famous receptions. She had looked quite resolute and  very happy then, not at all like the woman who had stared so strangely  at Reginald in the Broadway restaurant.    He regarded this encounter as very fortunate. He knew so much of her  personal history that it almost seemed to him as if they had been  intimate for years. She, too, felt on familiar ground with him.

Free  nitrogen costs nothing and is good for nothing. If a land-owner has a  right to an expanding pyramid of air above him to the limits of the  atmosphere--as, I believe, the courts have decided in the eaves-dropping  cases--then for every square foot of his ground he owns as much  nitrogen as he could buy for $2500. The air is four-fifths free nitrogen  and if we could absorb it in our lungs as we do the oxygen of the other  fifth a few minutes breathing would give us a full meal. But we let this  free nitrogen all out again through our noses and then go and pay 35  cents a pound for steak or 60 cents a dozen for eggs in order to get  enough combined nitrogen to live on. Though man is immersed in an ocean  of nitrogen, yet he cannot make use of it. He is like Coleridge's  \"Ancient Mariner\" with \"water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to  drink.\"    Nitrogen is, as Hood said not so truly about gold, \"hard to get and hard  to hold.\" The bacteria that form the nodules on the roots of peas and  beans have the power that man has not of utilizing free nitrogen.  Instead of this quiet inconspicuous process man has to call upon the  lightning when he wants to fix nitrogen. The air contains the oxygen and  nitrogen which it is desired to combine to form nitrates but the atoms  are paired, like to like. Passing an electric spark through the air  breaks up some of these pairs and in the confusion of the shock the  lonely atoms seize on their nearest neighbor and so may get partners of  the other sort. I have seen this same thing happen in a square dance  where somebody made a blunder. It is easy to understand the reaction if  we represent the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen by the initials of their  names in this fashion:          NN  +  OO   -->   NO + NO    nitrogen  oxygen    nitric oxide    The --> represents Jove's thunderbolt, a stroke of artificial  lightning. We see on the left the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen,  before taking the electric treatment, as separate elemental pairs, and  then to the right of the arrow we find them as compound molecules of  nitric oxide. This takes up another atom of oxygen from the air and  becomes NOO, or using a subscript figure to indicate the number of atoms  and so avoid repeating the letter, NO_{2} which is the familiar nitro  group of nitric acid (HO--NO_{2}) and of its salts, the nitrates, and of  its organic compounds, the high explosives. The NO_{2} is a brown and  evil-smelling gas which when dissolved in water (HOH) and further  oxidized is completely converted into nitric acid.    The apparatus which effects this transformation is essentially a  gigantic arc light in a chimney through which a current of hot air is  blown. The more thoroughly the air comes under the action of the  electric arc the more molecules of nitrogen and oxygen will be broken up  and rearranged, but on the other hand if the mixture of gases remains in  the path of the discharge the NO molecules are also broken up and go  back into their original form of NN and OO. So the object is to spread  out the electric arc as widely as possible and then run the air through  it rapidly. In the Schoenherr process the electric arc is a spiral flame  twenty-three feet long through which the air streams with a vortex  motion. In the Birkeland-Eyde furnace there is a series of semi-circular  arcs spread out by the repellent force of a powerful electric magnet in  a flaming disc seven feet in diameter with a temperature of 6300 deg. F. In  the Pauling furnace the electrodes between which the current strikes  are two cast iron tubes curving upward and outward like the horns of a  Texas steer and cooled by a stream of water passing through them. These  electric furnaces produce two or three ounces of nitric acid for each  kilowatt-hour of current consumed. Whether they can compete with the  natural nitrates and the products of other processes depends upon how  cheaply they can get their electricity. Before the war there were  several large installations in Norway and elsewhere where abundant water  power was available and now the Norwegians are using half a million  horse power continuously in the fixation of nitrogen and the rest of the  world as much again. The Germans had invested largely in these foreign  oxidation plants, but shortly before the war they had sold out and  turned their attention to other processes not requiring so much  electrical energy, for their country is poorly provided with water  power. The Haber process, that they made most of, is based upon as  simple a reaction as that we have been considering, for it consists in  uniting two elemental gases to make a compound, but the elements in this  case are not nitrogen and oxygen, but nitrogen and hydrogen. This gives  ammonia instead of nitric acid, but ammonia is useful for its own  purposes and it can be converted into nitric acid if this is desired.  The reaction is:      NN   +   HH + HH + HH --> NHHH + NHHH    Nitrogen  hydrogen         ammonia    The animals go in two by two, but they come out four by four. Four  molecules of the mixed elements are turned into two molecules and so the  gas shrinks to half its volume. At the same time it acquires an  odor--familiar to us when we are curing a cold--that neither of the  original gases had. The agent that effects the transformation in this  case is not the electric spark--for this would tend to work the reaction  backwards--but uranium, a rare metal, which has the peculiar property of  helping along a reaction while seeming to take no part in it. Such a  substance is called a catalyst. The action of a catalyst is rather  mysterious and whenever we have a mystery we need an analogy. We may,  then, compare the catalyst to what is known as \"a good mixer\" in  society. You know the sort of man I mean. He may not be brilliant or  especially talkative, but somehow there is always \"something doing\" at a  picnic or house-party when he is along. The tactful hostess, the salon  leader, is a social catalyst. The trouble with catalysts, either human  or metallic, is that they are rare and that sometimes they get sulky and  won't work if the ingredients they are supposed to mix are unsuitable.    But the uranium, osmium, platinum or whatever metal is used as a  catalyzing agent is expensive and although it is not used up it is  easily \"poisoned,\" as the chemists say, by impurities in the gases. The  nitrogen and the hydrogen for the Haber process must then be prepared  and purified before trying to combine them into ammonia. The nitrogen is  obtained by liquefying air by cold and pressure and then boiling off the  nitrogen at 194 deg. C. The oxygen left is useful for other purposes. The  hydrogen needed is extracted by a similar process of fractional  distillation from \"water-gas,\" the blue-flame burning gas used for  heating. Then the nitrogen and hydrogen, mixed in the proportion of one  to three, as shown in the reaction given above, are compressed to two  hundred atmospheres, heated to 1300 deg. F. and passed over the finely  divided uranium. The stream of gas that comes out contains about four  per cent. of ammonia, which is condensed to a liquid by cooling and the  uncombined hydrogen and nitrogen passed again through the apparatus.    The ammonia can be employed in refrigeration and other ways but if it is  desired to get the nitrogen into the form of nitric acid it has to be  oxidized by the so-called Ostwald process. This is the reaction:      NH_{3}  +  4O   -->   HNO_{3} + H_{2}O    ammonia  oxygen    nitric acid  water    The catalyst used to effect this combination is the metal platinum in  the form of fine wire gauze, since the action takes place only on the  surface. The ammonia gas is mixed with air which supplies the oxygen and  the heated mixture run through the platinum gauze at the rate of several  yards a second. Although the gases come in contact with the platinum  only a five-hundredth part of a second yet eighty-five per cent. is  converted into nitric acid.    The Haber process for the making of ammonia by direct synthesis from its  constituent elements and the supplemental Ostwald process for the  conversion of the ammonia into nitric acid were the salvation of  Germany. As soon as the Germans saw that their dash toward Paris had  been stopped at the Marne they knew that they were in for a long war and  at once made plans for a supply of fixed nitrogen. The chief German dye  factories, the Badische Anilin and Soda-Fabrik, promptly put  $100,000,000 into enlarging its plant and raised its production of  ammonium sulfate from 30,000 to 300,000 tons. One German electrical firm  with aid from the city of Berlin contracted to provide 66,000,000 pounds  of fixed nitrogen a year at a cost of three cents a pound for the next  twenty-five years. The 750,000 tons of Chilean nitrate imported annually  by Germany contained about 116,000 tons of the essential element  nitrogen. The fourteen large plants erected during the war can fix in  the form of nitrates 500,000 tons of nitrogen a year, which is more than  twice the amount needed for internal consumption. So Germany is now not  only independent of the outside world but will have a surplus of  nitrogen products which could be sold even in America at about half what  the farmer has been paying for South American saltpeter.    Besides the Haber or direct process there are other methods of making  ammonia which are, at least outside of Germany, of more importance. Most  prominent of these is the cyanamid process. This requires electrical  power since it starts with a product of the electrical furnace, calcium  carbide, familiar to us all as a source of acetylene gas.    If a stream of nitrogen is passed over hot calcium carbide it is taken  up by the carbide according to the following equation:           CaC_{2}  +  N_{2}    -->    CaCN_{2}  +  C    calcium carbide nitrogen"]]]
