The sailor is not surprised by the regular movements of the  ocean; he will draw from them no theological inductions. The phenomena  of nature do not prove the existence of a God, except to a few  forewarned men, to whom has been shown in advance the finger of God in  all the objects whose mechanism could embarrass them. The unprejudiced  philosopher sees nothing in the wonders of nature but permanent and  invariable law; nothing but the necessary effects of different  combinations of diversified substance.          XXXVII.--THE WONDERS OF NATURE EXPLAIN THEMSELVES BY NATURAL CAUSES.    Is there anything more surprising than the logic of so many profound  doctors, who, instead of acknowledging the little light they have upon  natural agencies, seek outside of nature--that is to say, in imaginary  regions--an agent less understood than this nature, of which they can at  least form some idea? To say that God is the author of the phenomena  that we see, is it not attributing them to an occult cause? What is God?  What is a spirit? They are causes of which we have no idea. Sages! study  nature and her laws; and when you can from them unravel the action of  natural causes, do not go in search of supernatural causes, which, very  far from enlightening your ideas, will but entangle them more and more  and make it impossible for you to understand yourselves.          XXXVIII--CONTINUATION.    Nature, you say, is totally inexplicable without a God; that is to say,  in order to explain what you understand so little, you need a cause  which you do not understand at all. You pretend to make clear that which  is obscure, by magnifying its obscurity. You think you have untied a  knot by multiplying knots. Enthusiastic philosophers, in order to prove  to us the existence of a God, you copy complete treatises on botany; you  enter into minute details of the parts of the human body; you ascend  into the air to contemplate the revolutions of the stars; you return  then to earth to admire the course of the waters; you fly into ecstasies  over butterflies, insects, polyps, organized atoms, in which you think  to find the greatness of your God; all these things will not prove the  existence of this God; they will only prove that you have not the ideas  which you should have of the immense variety of causes and effects that  can produce the infinitely diversified combinations, of which the  universe is the assemblage. This will prove that you ignore nature, that  you have no idea of her resources when you judge her incapable of  producing a multitude of forms and beings, of which your eyes, even by  the aid of the microscope, see but the least part; finally, this will  prove, that not being able to know the sensible and comprehensible  agents, you find it easier to have recourse to a word, by which you  designate an agent, of whom it will always be impossible for you to form  any true idea.          XXXIX.--THE WORLD HAS NOT BEEN CREATED, AND MATTER MOVES BY ITSELF.    They tell us gravely that there is no effect without a cause; they  repeat to us very often that the world did not create itself. But the  universe is a cause, not an effect; it is not a work, has not been made,  because it was impossible that it should be made. The world has always  been, its existence is necessary. It is the cause of itself. Nature,  whose essence is visibly acting and producing, in order to fulfill her  functions, as we see she does, needs no invisible motor far more unknown  than herself. Matter moves by its own energy, by the necessary result of  its heterogeneity; the diversity of its movements or of its ways of  acting, constitute only the diversity of substances; we distinguish one  being from another but by the diversity of the impressions or movements  which they communicate to our organs.          XL.--CONTINUATION.    You see that everything in nature is in a state of activity, and you  pretend that nature of itself is dead and without energy! You believe  that all this, acting of itself, has need of a motor! Well! who is this  motor? It is a spirit, that is to say, an absolutely incomprehensible  and contradictory being. Conclude then, I say to you, that matter acts  of itself, and cease to reason about your spiritual motor, which has  nothing that is necessary to put it into motion. Return from your  useless excursions; come down from an imaginary into a real world; take  hold of second causes; leave to theologians their \"First Cause,\" of  which nature has no need in order to produce all the effects which you  see.          XLI.--OTHER PROOFS THAT MOTION IS IN THE ESSENCE OF MATTER, AND THAT IT  IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE A SPIRITUAL MOTOR.    It is but by the diversity of impressions or of effects which substances  or bodies make upon us, that we feel them, that we have perceptions and  ideas of them, that we distinguish them one from another, that we assign  to them peculiarities. Moreover, in order to perceive or to feel an  object, this object must act upon our organs; this object can not act  upon us without exciting some motion in us; it can not produce any  motion in us if it is not itself in motion. As soon as I see an object,  my eyes must be struck by it; I can not conceive of light and of vision  without a motion in the luminous, extended, and colored body which  communicates itself to my eye, or which acts upon my retina. As soon as  I smell a body, my olfactory nerve must be irritated or put into motion  by the parts exhaled from an odorous body. As soon as I hear a sound,  the tympanum of my ear must be struck by the air put in motion by a  sonorous body, which could not act if it was not moved of itself. From  which it follows, evidently, that without motion I can neither feel,  see, distinguish, compare, nor judge the body, nor even occupy my  thought with any matter whatever. It is said in the schools, that the  essence of a being is that from which flow all the properties of that  being. Now then, it is evident that all the properties of bodies or of  substances of which we have ideas, are due to the motion which alone  informs us of their existence, and gives us the first conceptions of it.  I can not be informed or assured of my own existence but by the motions  which I experience within myself. I am compelled to conclude that motion  is as essential to matter as its extension, and that it can not be  conceived of without it. If one persists in caviling about the evidences  which prove to us that motion is an essential property of matter, he  must at least acknowledge that substances which seemed dead or deprived  of all energy, take motion of themselves as soon as they are brought  within the proper distance to act upon each other. Pyrophorus, when  enclosed in a bottle or deprived of contact with the air, can not take  fire by itself, but it burns as soon as exposed to the air. Flour and  water cause fermentation as soon as they are mixed. Thus dead substances  engender motion of themselves. Matter has then the power to move itself,  and nature, in order to act, does not need a motor whose essence would  hinder its activity.          XLII.--THE EXISTENCE OF MAN DOES NOT PROVE THAT OF GOD.    Whence comes man? What is his origin? Is he the result of the fortuitous  meeting of atoms? Was the first man formed of the dust of the earth? I  do not know! Man appears to me to be a production of nature like all  others she embraces. I should be just as much embarrassed to tell you  whence came the first stones, the first trees, the first elephants, the  first ants, the first acorns, as to explain the origin of the human  species. Recognize, we are told, the hand of God, of an infinitely  intelligent and powerful workman, in a work so wonderful as the human  machine. I would admit without question that the human machine appears  to me surprising; but since man exists in nature, I do not believe it  right to say that his formation is beyond the forces of nature. I will  add, that I could conceive far less of the formation of the human  machine, when to explain it to me they tell me that a pure spirit, who  has neither eyes, nor feet, nor hands, nor head, nor lungs, nor mouth,  nor breath, has made man by taking a little dust and blowing upon it.  The savage inhabitants of Paraguay pretend to be descended from the  moon, and appear to us as simpletons; the theologians of Europe pretend  to be descended from a pure spirit. Is this pretension more sensible?    Man is intelligent, hence it is concluded that he must be the work of an  intelligent being, and not of a nature devoid of intelligence. Although  nothing is more rare than to see man use this intelligence, of which he  appears so proud, I will admit that he is intelligent, that his  necessities develop in him this faculty, that the society of other men  contributes especially to cultivate it. But in the human machine and in  the intelligence with which it is endowed, I see nothing that shows in a  precise manner the infinite intelligence of the workman who has the  honor of making it. I see that this admirable machine is subject to  derangement; that at that time this wonderful intelligence is  disordered, and sometimes totally disappears; from this I conclude that  human intelligence depends upon a certain disposition of the material  organs of the body, and that, because man is an intelligent being, it is  not well to conclude that God must be an intelligent being, any more  than because man is material, we are compelled to conclude that God is  material. The intelligence of man no more proves the intelligence of God  than the malice of men proves the malice of this God, of whom they  pretend that man is the work. In whatever way theology is taken, God  will always be a cause contradicted by its effects, or of whom it is  impossible to judge by His works.

At noon the steamer was berthed at  a pier, and their packages were transferred to a paddle-wheeler,  which was to take them over three hundred miles up the wide estuary  to a Belgian station. Thence, perhaps, they would proceed hundreds  of miles further by another river steamer before they took to their  own boat.    \"Why, we may be days before we really get to work,\" said Venning,  when the vastness of the Congo was forced on his attention by a  casual reference to \"hundreds of miles.\"    \"Days--weeks, my boy, before we come to the fringe of our field. The  river is more than half the length of the Continent; its length is  half the distance by sea from Southampton to the Cape, and, next to  the Amazon, it pours a greater body of water into the sea than any  river in the world.\"    \"Africa,\" said Compton, \"seems to be the driest and the wettest, in  parts, of any country; and all its great rivers, except the Nile,  run to waste.\"    \"They'll keep,\" said Mr. Hume.  \"When the old world gets tired, worn  out, and over-populated, it will find use for these big, silent,  deserted rivers, that would carry the ships of the world on their  yellow waters.\"        CHAPTER IV    THE STORY OF MUATA    They went from the wide estuary into the true river, with a width  that opened out at times to twenty miles; and while the white men  sweltered on the sticky decks, the rescued man grew in strength.  When they reached Stanley Pool his skin was like satin again, with a  polish on it from the palm-oil he rubbed in continually.    And when he found his strength he found use for his tongue, and in  the speech he made to his rescuers. Mr. Hume caught the meaning of a  few words of Bantu, Compton detected a phrase or two in Arabic, and  Venning, who had been schooling himself since they passed Banana  Point at the river mouth, picked out other words in the tongue of  the river tribes.    The meaning of his speech, when they had made a mosaic of the  different understood facts, was this--that he was a great man in his  own land, but only a child now, being without arms or men, but that  if the white men ever came to his place, he would be a father and a  mother to them. He would throw his shield before them, and protect  them with bow and spear.    After this they sat together learning a polyglot speech that would  serve roughly as a medium of exchange.    And this was the story of the chief, slowly put together out of  these talks--    \"I am Muata the chief. The kraal of my house is toward the setting  sun, but the fire no longer burns on the hearth. The men-robbers  fell upon the place in the early morning.  The people were scattered  like goats before the lion. Many were taken by the men-robbers, and  many were slain; and among them my father.    \"The chief's wife, my mother, fled with me into the Great Forest.  Many days she lived on roots, and the 'little people' found her in  her wanderings. They took her by crooked paths far from the land of  her people. Ohe!    \"Through the dark woods--through the dark and terrible woods,  through the mist and the rain, with much pain, she followed them as  they went before her like shadows. And in the folds of her blanket  she bore me on her back. It is true.    \"She was straight as the palm when she fled from the kraal, and when  after long journeying she set me down at the hiding-place, she was  thin and bent. Thin and bent was the chief's wife, she who had  maidens to wait on her.    \"At the hiding-place in the forest there were people whose kraals  had been burnt by the men-robbers. Outcasts  they were, of many  tribes, living together without a chief; but the place was fat, and  they grew fat, being without spirit.    \"And Muata the child played with other children and grew. He grew on  the fatness of the land, and when he could walk, his playmates were  the young of the jackal; his playthings were the bow and the spear.    \"Ohe! Muata grew to strength like the lion's cub in the knowledge of  the hunt. She, even his mother, taught him to follow the trail,  showed him the leaf bruised by the foot of a man traveling, showed  him the tracks of the beasts, taught him the cries of the animals.    \"She rubbed the oil into his skin, set him to hurl the spear, to  shaft the arrow, to hit the mark; set him to run and swim, to creep  like a snake, to bound like the buck.    \"So Muata grew in the ways of a hunter; and when the men of the  place went on the hunt, Muata went with them--went as a hunter, and  the hut of his mother had meat to spare.    \"Then the chief's wife took the boy to the headmen, and the witch-  doctors. They drew on his body the sign of the otter--he who is  cunning and brave, who is at home on land or in the water. They made  him a warrior, he who was a boy, because there was always meat in  the hut of his mother.    \"But his mother spoke. 'O Muata, hunter of the wild pig, take your  spear and your bow, and the quiver of arrows with the iron heads.  You will hunt men.' Thus it came that Muata went alone on the war-  trail. With him went his mother, who carried the pots and the  sleeping-mat, she who carried nothing at her kraal.    \"The trail led into the Great Forest toward the rising sun, and  there were dangers between the sunrise and its setting--dangers  between the setting of the sun and its rising.    \"A man-ape of great stature, hairy and fierce, stood before us in  the path. He lifted his brows at us, and bared his teeth. Muata was  afraid, but his mother called to him softly--called to him not to  run, called to him to drive this thing from her path.    \"Muata notched an arrow and smote the man-ape in the neck. Yoh! He  stood like a man upright, and roared. His roar was like the roar of  a lion in pain. Foam came from his lips, and his eyes were fierce.    \"The knees of Muata shook; his blood was like water. He was afraid,  but his mother laughed and cracked her fingers. The man-ape drew  near, but she stood--she the chief's wife. So Muata the boy notched  an arrow, and would have loosened it, but she spoke--'Let him come  still nearer, O warrior.'    \"Muata grew stronger at the word. The man-ape came nearer. Three  paces away he stood--and his head was above the head of Muata, his  arms were like a young tree, and the chest was like the chest of two  men. He opened his mouth and the arrow flew into his throat, bit  deep till the point stood out behind. He clutched the shaft with his  hands, rocked, and fell, and Muata, taking his spear, thrust it  between the great ribs.    \"Yoh! the man-ape was dead, and the chief's wife broke the great  teeth from the jaw, and cut off the hairs above the eyes. She burnt  them, and mixed them with his blood, for Muata to drink.  Muata  drank and was strong.    \"So those two passed through the forest, through the silent dark of  the woods, in pain and hunger. Passed out into the plains where  there were kraals and yellow men in white coverings.    \"And the chiefs wife spoke: 'Behold, it is for this I have suffered  much for thee, Muata. What I have sown in sorrow and pain I will  reap in your strength. Look and look again! Those are of the race  who destroyed the kraals of your people. They are men-hunters,  kraal-burners, slayers of children. Steal upon them where they walk  idly, and for each arrow slay a man.'    \"Muata waited on these men a day and a night, and when he sought his  mother on the edge of the forest his quiver was empty, and the  chief's wife spoke: 'Where did the arrow strike, O warrior?'  And  Muata answered, 'In the throat, O my mother.'  And the chief's wife  said again, 'It is well; but the warrior sees to it that he can  recover his arrow.  And your quiver is empty.'  So Muata returned  and recovered his arrows, for the men lay where they fell, the  living having gone into the kraals in fear.    \"So Muata and the chiefs wife went slowly back to the place of  hiding. And because Muata had slain the man-ape and the robbers--  they who slay children--the chief's wife sought out the headmen, and  spoke: 'Oh, listen! This is Muata, the son of a chief. He has slain  the man-ape, and for each arrow that was in his quiver a man-robber.  It is fit that he be your chief.' But they laughed, and the chiefs  wife held her peace.    \"And again, after the crops were gathered, Muata went again on the  war-trail alone--went to the river, followed it down the bank, and  the little people led him to a kraal in the wood by the river bank--  a kraal with a high fence, the kraal of the yellow men-robbers.  Muata dived beneath the fence with a short spear in his hand. With  his spear he slew the man who watched by the gate, opened the gate,  and put fire to the huts. The yellow men ran, some into the forest,  and there the little people found them; others fled into a canoe to  cross; Muata swam after, and with his spear ripped open the bottom,  so that it filled and sank.    \"And again, when the place of hiding was reached, the chief's wife  sought out the headmen and spoke, saying that Muata was a chief's  son. They put her aside with words, saying there was no proof of  this last thing he had done. But Muata whistled, and the little  people came forward, saying the chiefs son had destroyed the kraal  of the  evil-doers. Then the headmen took counsel, and again put the  chief's wife off.    \"The chief's wife bowed her head, but, seeing that she was weak, and  that her mind was fixed on the thing she asked for, Muata took the  matter into his own hand. He bade the women prepare a big hut for  his mother--he put a stick to their shoulders; and when a man sought  to slay him there in the presence of them all, Muata smote the man  under the arm with his spear. So they built the great hut, and women  waited on the chief's wife, his mother, carried water for her, cut  the wood, and built the fire.    \"So Muata was chief, and year by year he led the men of the place  against the yellow robbers, till the name of"]]]
