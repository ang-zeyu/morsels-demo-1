To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"him guilty, but we only have historical proof of the sending of his son  into Hulagu's camp to beg that his province might be spared, at a time  when all the princes of Syria, seized with panic, threw themselves at  the feet of the Mongolian general. Be that as it may, he none the less  committed a piece of treachery, since he had sworn not to call him to  account for his former crimes. Beybars hoped, now that he had disposed  of Malik Mughith, that the fortress Kerak would immediately surrender to  his emissary, Emir Bedr ed-Din Beisari, but the governor of the fortress  feared to trust the promises of a perjurer and offered resistance.  Beybars therefore set out for Syria with all the necessary siege  apparatus, constructed by the best engineers of Egypt and Syria. The  garrison saw the impossibility of a long resistance and capitulated.    The son of Malik Mughith, El-Malik el-Aziz, a boy of twelve, was  honoured as prince and taken to Egypt, as also Mughith's family. His  emirs and officials were treated with consideration, but the prince was  later thrown into prison. Nothing certain is known with regard to the  death of Mughith. According to some reports, because he offended the  wife of Beybars, when as a wandering Mamluk he once was staying with  him, he was delivered over to the sultan's wives and was put to death by  them; another account says that he died of hunger in prison.    After the conquest of Shekif, the sultan made an attack on the province  of Tripoli because Prince Bok-mond, Governor of Antioch and Tripoli,  was his bitterest enemy and the truest ally of the Mongolians, and had,  moreover, at the time of Hulagu's attack on Syria, made himself master  of several places which till then had belonged to the Mussulmans. The  whole land was wasted, all the houses destroyed, all Christians who fell  into the hands of the troops were murdered, and several strongholds in  the mountains conquered. Laden with rich booty, the Moslem army set out  for Hemessa. From here Beybars proceeded towards Hamah and divided the  army into three divisions; one division, under the Emir Bedr ed-Din  Khaznadar (treasurer), was to take the direction of Suwaidiya, the port  of Antioch; the second, under Emir Izz ed-Din Ighan, struck the route  towards Der-besak; the third, which he led himself, proceeded in a  straight line over Apamaa and Schoghr towards Antioch, which was the  meeting-place for the two other emirs, and would so be shut in from the  north, the west, and the south. On the 16th May the sultan found himself  in front of the town, which contained a population of over one hundred  thousand. Fighting soon ensued between the outposts of the sultan and  the constable who advanced against him at the head of the militia. The  latter was defeated, and the constable himself taken prisoner. On the 3d  of Ramadhan the whole army had united and preparations were made for  the siege. Meanwhile the sultan had already attempted to persuade the  imprisoned constable to return to the town and enduce them to surrender,  and to leave his own son behind as a hostage. But when several days had  passed in fruitless discussions, at last the sultan gave the word for  the attack. In spite of the resistance of the Christians, the walls  were scaled on the same day, and the garrison retired thereupon into the  citadel; the inhabitants were massacred or taken prisoner and all the  houses plundered. No one could escape, for Beybars had blocked all the  entrances. On the next day the garrison, women and children included,  which numbered eight thousand, surrendered on account of lack of water  and meal. The chiefs apparently made their escape during the confusion  and fled into the mountains. The garrison only saved their lives by  surrendering. Beybars had them chained and distributed as slaves amongst  his troops; he then had the other prisoners and the rest of the booty  brought together, and proceeded with the lawful distribution. When  everything had been settled, the citadel was set on fire, but the  conflagration was so great that the whole town was consumed.    Beybars died soon after his return from Asia Minor (July 1, 1277).  According to some reports his death was occasioned by a violent fever;  other accounts say that he died in consequence of a poison which he had  prepared for an Ayyubid and which he accidentally took himself. He had  designated the eldest of his sons as his successor, under the name  of El-Malik es-Said, and in order to give him a strong support he had  married him to the daughter of the Emir Kilawun, one of his best and  most influential generals. In spite of all this, however, es-Said was  not able to maintain himself on the throne for any length of time.    Kilawun conspired against his master, and was soon able to ascend the  throne under the title of El-Malik el-Mansur. His fame as a warrior was  already established, and he added to his successes during his ten  years' reign. His first task was to quell disturbances in Syria, and he  despatched an army thither and captured Damascus. In the year 680 of  the Hegira he took the field in person against a large force of Tatars,  defeated them, and raised the siege of Rahabah. Eight years later he  laid siege to Tripoli, then rich and flourishing after two centuries of  Christian occupation, and the town was taken and its inhabitants killed.  Other expeditions were undertaken against Nubia, but the Nubians, after  they had been twice defeated, appear to have re-established themselves.    [Illustration: 038.jpg COURT IN THE MORISTAN OF THE KILAWUN]    The fortress of Acre was at this time the only important stronghold  still retained by the Christians, and for its conquest Kilawun was  making preparations when he died, on the 10th of November, 1290.  Kilawun, says the modern historian Weil, has been unduly praised by  historians, most of whom lived in the reign of his son. He was certainly  not so bloodthirsty as Beybars, and he also oppressed his subjects less.  He, too, cared more for the increase and establishment of his kingdom  than for justice and good faith. He held no agreement sacred, if he  could get any advantage by breaking it, as was shown by his behaviour  towards the Crusaders and the descendants of Beybars. The most beautiful  monument which he left behind him was a huge building outside Cairo,  which included a hospital, a school, and his own tomb. The hospital was  so large that every disease had a special room allotted to it; there  were also apartments for women, and large storerooms for provisions and  medical requirements, and a large auditorium in which the head doctor  delivered his lectures on medicine. The expenses were so great--for  even people of wealth were taken without compensation--that special  administrators were appointed to oversee and keep an account of the  necessary outlay. Besides these officers, several stewards and overseers  were appointed to control the revenues devoted to the hospital by  different institutions. Under the dome of the tomb the Koran and  traditional charters were taught, and both teachers and scholars  received their payment from the state. A large adjacent hall contained  a library of many works on the Koran, tradition, language, medicine,  practical theology, jurisprudence, and literature, and was kept in good  condition by a special librarian and six officials. The school building  contained four audience-halls for the teachers of the Islamite schools,  and in addition to these a school for children, into which sixty poor  orphans were received without any charge and provided with board,  lodging, and clothes.    Khalil, the son of Kilawun, who succeeded him, with the title of  El-Malik el-Ashraf, was able to begin operations in the spring of 1291  against Acre, and on the 18th of May, after an obstinate resistance, the  town was taken by storm. Those who could not escape by water were either  cut down or taken prisoner; the town was plundered, then burnt, and the  fortifications razed to the ground.    [Illustration: 043.jpg WINDOW IN THE MAUSOLEUM OF KILAWUN]    After the fall of Acre, towns such as Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and others,  which were still in the hands of the Christians, offered no resistance,  and were either deserted by their inhabitants or given up to the enemy.  El-Ashraf, now that he had cleared Syria of the Crusaders, turned his  arms against the Mongols and their vassals. He began with the storming  of Kalat er-rum, a fortress on the Upper Euphrates in the neighbourhood  of Bireh, the possession of which was important both for the defence of  Northern Syria and for attacks on Armenia and Asia Minor. In spite of  many pompous declarations that this was only the beginning of greater  conquests in Asia Minor and Irak, he retired as soon as the Ilkhan  Kaikhatu sent a strong detachment of troops against him. Later on he  threatened the Prince of Armenia-Minor with war, and obliged him to hand  over certain border towns. He also exchanged some threatening letters  with Kaikhatu. But neither reigned long enough to make these threats  good, for Kaikhatu was soon after dethroned by Baidu, and Baidu in  his turn by Gazan (1295), after many civil wars which had continually  hindered him from carrying on a foreign war. El-Ashraf was murdered in  1294, whilst hunting, by the regent Baidara, whom he had threatend to  turn out of his office. Kara Sonkor, Lajin, El-Mansuri, and some of the  other emirs had conspired with Baidara in the hope that, when once the  deed was accomplished, all the chiefs in the kingdom would applaud their  action, since El-Ashraf had slain and imprisoned many influential emirs,  and was generally denounced as an irreligious man, who transgressed  not only against the laws of Islam, but also against those of nature.  Baidara, however, immediately proceeded to mount the throne, and a  strong party, with the Emir Ketboga at its head, was formed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17334"],[0,"Initiative Psychic Energy (#6)"],[1,"with a large  number of men, giving careful attention to matters of diet and  exercise, and the results have seemed in a measure to support his  theory.    Dr. Fred W. Eastman reports that owing to pressure of work he was  recently unable to get more than three or four hours' sleep out of the  twenty-four during a period of many months, and that so far from being  hurt by it he gained five pounds. He says: \"If restoration during  sleep is a task so relatively small, the question arises whether, in  order to complete restoration, it is necessary for us to spend so much  time in sleep as we do. Perhaps on account of popular opinion and  personal habit, we waste much time in this jelly-fish condition that  could more profitably be spent in active pursuit of our ambitions. The  answer, of course, depends upon the nature of our occupations. If  there is muscular effort involved, with a correspondingly large amount  of waste in the cells and blood, eight hours or more are probably  necessary. But if the work is of a sedentary nature, and mainly of the  brain, there is naturally a smaller quantity of accumulated waste, and  less time is required for removal. Many are the instances of great  men, past and present, who have lived healthily and worked  unceasingly and strenuously on only four or five hours of sleep, or  half the laborer's portion. Surely we do not suppose that these men  were or are physically different from others, but rather that by  inclination or necessity they have developed a habit of sleeping  intensely for a short period, with resulting gain of time and  efficiency.\"    [Sidenote: _Determining Your Norm of Efficiency_]    So far as this matter of relaxation, rest and sleep is concerned, the  rule to follow is obviously this: _Determine accurately by experiment  the proper relation between periods of work and periods of rest in  your own case, then increase your efficiency by maintaining this  relation_.    In Denmark they feed cows scientifically. Day by day they increase  the allowance of milk-producing food. Day by day the yield of milk  increases. At last there comes a day when measurement shows that there  is no longer any increase in the production of milk. They then  decrease the food till the output of milk diminishes. So they  determine the normal.    So with you and your hours of work and leisure. Give more and more  time to your business each day until there comes an impairment in the  quality of your work. Stop short of this. You have found your norm of  efficiency.          CHAPTER V    THE SECRET OF MENTAL EFFICIENCY      [Sidenote: Where Energy Is Stored]    You are called upon to master and conserve the innate energies of your  mind. This means that you must (1) find out where these energies are  stored, and (2) learn the conditions that determine their activity.    _All past experiences are conserved within us in the form of  complexes. These complexes consist of ideas, emotions and impulses to  muscular activity. By the primary law of association the recall to  consciousness of any one of these component elements of a complex  brings with it all the rest_.    [Sidenote: _Bodily Effects of Ideas_]    For example, the ideas pertaining to any terrifying experience, when  recalled to consciousness, bring with them the trembling, the wildly  beating heart, the shaking knees, with which they were originally  accompanied. The victim of stage-fright feels his knees give way and  that he is sinking to the floor; his heart beats tumultuously, cold  perspiration covers his body, he blushes, his mouth is dry, and his  voice sticks in his throat. Afterwards, alone in his own room, the  memory of that dreadful moment, the thought of another appearance  before that audience, will be accompanied by the same physiological  effects.    [Sidenote: _Impulses and Inhibitions_]    Every such bodily movement is an expression of energy. The recall to  consciousness of the terrifying experience, the recall of the picture  of the assembled audience, these things automatically produce bodily  activities. So we must conclude that _Every idea in memory has  associated with it the potential energy necessary for the production  of muscular movement_.    It does not necessarily follow that the recall to consciousness of a  given idea will be invariably followed by an outwardly visible  muscular activity expressive of its energy. Just as the mere presence  of an idea in consciousness tends to bring about a movement, so _the  presence of a contrary idea will tend to inhibit it_.    Try to imagine that you are bending your forefinger. At the same time  hold it straight. Your finger will actually tremble with the dammed-up  energy of the repressed impulse. But the finger will not actually  move, because the idea of its not moving is just as much a part of  your consciousness as the idea of its moving. Put out of your  consciousness this thought of the finger's not moving, and forthwith  the finger will bend.    Your conduct during your waking hours is thus always the result of  opposing forces, _some tending in one direction, others tending to  counteract the first._ Thus there comes about a great waste of mental  power and an appalling loss of individual efficiency.    [Sidenote: _Training for Mental \"Team-Work\"_]    In the language of sport, you are suffering from a lack of mental  \"team work.\" The effect is the same as if the members of a football  team, instead of combining their forces against the opposing side,  should spend their time in restraining one another.    It requires but one step, and not a difficult one at that, to lead you  to the conclusion that the solution of this problem lies in having in  consciousness at any one moment only such ideas as harmonize. Let that  condition prevail, and the potential energies of all ideas in  consciousness must flow together in a broad stream of useful and  exhilarating activity.    [Sidenote: _Rust and the \"Daily Grind\"_]    Your work should be a source of pleasure to you. If it is simply a  disagreeable task that has to be performed, if it is a \"daily grind,\"  if you have to hold yourself to it by unremitting effort of the will,  you are no better than a rusty engine, and all your workings will be  accompanied by jars, frictions, and complaining squeaks that bespeak a  positively wicked loss of power.    Hold the right thoughts persistently in mind, and you cannot help  working steadily on toward the goal you are thinking of. Keep steadily  at work with the right thoughts persistently in mind and success is  sure to come.    _Success, then, lies in the concentration of mental energies. And this  concentration is to be brought about by holding in consciousness only  those ideas that harmonize_.    [Sidenote: _Ideas That Harmonize_]    There must be the greatest discrimination and care used in the  selection of these ideas that are to constitute such a co-ordinating  consciousness. There must be a \"re-imaging\" or imagination in a  literal and practical sense of those ideas only that carry with them  impulses to motion in the same general direction. You must have a set  purpose in life, and you must yield your powers without hindrance and  without reservation to the accomplishment of that set purpose.    [Sidenote: _Five Rules for Conserving Energy_]    I. _You must exercise deliberate, patient and persistent watchfulness  to detect and repress all useless bodily movements_. You have all  sorts of silly habits, twitchings, jerkings, itchings, winkings,  shrugs, frowns, coughs, snifflings and odd and meaningless gestures.  Watch yourself. Do these things no more. Save your eyes and ears and  hands and nerves, all your mental energy, for useful effort.    II. _You must give yourself, mind and body, to one thing at a time,  disregarding all that would lure you from your chosen task_.    III. _You must acquire a self-conscious sense of your own  self-mastery._ It will help you to acquire this feeling if you will  continually assert, \"I can and will accomplish anything that I am  determined upon! I have the power of will! I will accomplish this  thing! I will!\" Make these assertions with all the force and intensity  of your whole being until you are pervaded with a sense of your own  power. Do this faithfully, and in time this courageous and manly  attitude will become an inherent part of your personality.    IV. _You must have confidence._ And when we say confidence we do not  mean a purely intellectual conviction. We mean a profoundly emotional  faith. It will help you to cultivate this feeling of confidence if you  will affirm many times a day, \"I have implicit confidence in myself! I  have perfect faith in my own powers! I am absolute master of myself  and of my career!\" Practice affirmations of this kind persistently,  and in time your mind will have permanently acquired the habit of  facing the facts of life in the way essential to success.    V. _You must exert a favorable influence upon the mental attitude of  those about you_. This is not so difficult as it would appear. You  cannot yourself acquire will-power, confidence and courage without  impressing others with your possession of these qualities.  Personalities are revealed one to another by faint and suggestive  activities all unconsciously perceived. Your concentration of energy  will inspire others. You will radiate an \"atmosphere\" of success. You  will subtly influence your associates. You will be a force to reckon  with, and the world will know it. Your air of success will draw others  to you, will bring business and goodwill, and men and money will seek  a share in your enterprises.    Master your mental energies, train them, concentrate them,--thus only  may you win riches with honor.    Thus broadly put, there is, or perhaps it would be more accurate to  say there seems to be, nothing startlingly new about this proposition.    The world has always realized that singleness of purpose,"]]]
