If the tube is rightly placed the apertures will  of course lie in a right line, so that it will be possible to look  through all three at once. If not, it will be easy to determine towards  what part of the object-glass the eye-tube is directed, and to correct  the position of the tube accordingly.    The best tests for determining the defining power of a telescope are  close double or multiple stars, the components of which are not very  unequal. The illuminating power should be tested by directing the  telescope towards double or multiple stars having one or more minute  components. Many of the nebulae serve as tests both for illumination and  defining power. As we proceed we shall meet with proper objects for  testing different telescopes. For the present, let the following list  suffice. It is selected from Admiral Smyth's tests, obtained by  diminishing the aperture of a 6-in. telescope having a focal length of  8-1/2 feet:    A two-inch aperture, with powers of from 60 to 100, should exhibit    [alpha] Piscium (3\".5).   | [delta] Cassiopeiae (9\".5),                            |    mag. (4 and 7-1/2)  [gamma] Leonis  (3\".2).   | Polaris (18\".6), mag. (2-1/2                            |    and 9-1/2)    A four-inch, powers 80 to 120, should exhibit    [xi] Ursae Majoris (2\".4). | [sigma] Cassiopeiae (3\".1),                            |    mag. (6 and 8).  [gamma] Ceti (2\".6).      | [delta] Geminorum (7\".1),                            |    mag. (4 and 9).    The tests in the first column are for definition, those in the second  for illumination. It will be noticed that, though in the case of Polaris  the smaller aperture may be expected to show the small star of less than  the 9th magnitude, a larger aperture is required to show the 8th  magnitude component of [sigma] Cassiopeiae, on account of the greater  closeness of this double.    In favourable weather the following is a good general test of the  performance of a telescope:--A star of the 3rd or 4th magnitude at a  considerable elevation above the horizon should exhibit a small well  defined disc, surrounded by two or three fine rings of light.    A telescope should not be mounted within doors, if it can be  conveniently erected on solid ground, as every movement in the house  will cause the instrument to vibrate unpleasantly. Further, if the  telescope is placed in a warm room, currents of cold air from without  will render observed objects hazy and indistinct. In fact, Sir W.  Herschel considered that a telescope should not even be erected near a  house or elevation of any kind round which currents of air are likely to  be produced. If a telescope is used in a room, the temperature of the  room should be made as nearly equal as possible to that of the outer  air.    When a telescope is used out of doors a 'dew-cap,' that is, a tube of  tin or pasteboard, some ten or twelve inches long, should be placed on  the end of the instrument, so as to project beyond the object-glass. For  glass is a good radiator of heat, so that dew falls heavily upon it,  unless the radiation is in some way checked. The dew-cap does this  effectually. It should be blackened within, especially if made of metal.  \"After use,\" says old Kitchener, \"the telescope should be kept in a warm  place long enough for any moisture on the object-glass to evaporate.\" If  damp gets between the glasses it produces a fog (which opticians call a  sweat) or even a seaweed-like vegetation, by which a valuable glass may  be completely ruined.    The observer should not leave to the precious hours of the night the  study of the bearing and position of the objects he proposes to examine.  This should be done by day--an arrangement which has a twofold  advantage,--the time available for observation is lengthened, and the  eyes are spared sudden changes from darkness to light, and _vice versa_.  Besides, the eye is ill-fitted to examine difficult objects, after  searching by candle-light amongst the minute details recorded in maps or  globes. Of the effect of rest to the eye we have an instance in Sir J.  Herschel's rediscovery of the satellites of Uranus, which he effected  after keeping his eyes in darkness for a quarter of an hour. Kitchener,  indeed, goes so far as to recommend (with a _crede experto_) an  _interval of sleep_ in the darkness of the observing-room before  commencing operations. I have never tried the experiment, but I should  expect it to have a bad rather than a good effect on the eyesight, as  one commonly sees the eyes of a person who has been sleeping in his  day-clothes look heavy and bloodshot.    The object or the part of an object to be observed should be brought as  nearly as possible to the centre of the field of view. When there is no  apparatus for keeping the telescope pointed upon an object, the best  plan is so to direct the telescope by means of the finder, that the  object shall be just out of the field of view, and be brought (by the  earth's motion) across the centre of the field. Thus the vibrations  which always follow the adjustment of the tube will have subsided before  the object appears. The object should then be intently watched during  the whole interval of its passage across the field of view.    It is important that the student should recognise the fact that the  highest powers do not necessarily give the best views of celestial  objects. High powers in all cases increase the difficulty of  observation, since they diminish the field of view and the illumination  of the object, increase the motion with which (owing to the earth's  motion) the image moves across the field, and magnify all defects due to  instability of the stand, imperfection of the object-glass, or  undulation of the atmosphere. A good object-glass of three inches  aperture will in very favourable weather bear a power of about 300, when  applied to the observation of close double or multiple stars, but for  all other observations much lower powers should be used. Nothing but  failure and annoyance can follow the attempt to employ the highest  powers on unsuitable objects or in unfavourable weather.    The greatest care should be taken in focussing the telescope. When high  powers are used this is a matter of some delicacy. It would be well if  the eye-pieces intended for a telescope were so constructed that when  the telescope is focussed for one, this might be replaced by any other  without necessitating any use of the focussing rack-work. This could be  readily effected by suitably placing the shoulder which limits the  insertion of the eye-piece.    It will be found that, even in the worst weather for observation, there  are instants of distinct vision (with moderate powers) during which the  careful observer may catch sight of important details; and, similarly,  in the best observing weather, there are moments of unusually distinct  vision well worth patient waiting for, since in such weather alone the  full powers of the telescope can be employed.    The telescopist should not be deterred from observation by the presence  of fog or haze, since with a hazy sky definition is often singularly  good.    The observer must not expect distinct vision of objects near the  horizon. Objects near the eastern horizon during the time of morning  twilight are especially confused by atmospheric undulations; in fact,  early morning is a very unfavourable time for the observation of all  objects.    The same rules which we have been applying to refractors, serve for  reflectors. The performance of a reflector will be found to differ in  some respects, however, from that of a refractor. Mr. Dawes is, we  believe, now engaged in testing reflectors, and his unequalled  experience of refractors will enable him to pronounce decisively on the  relative merits of the two classes of telescopes.    We have little to say respecting the construction of telescopes. Whether  it is advisable or not for an amateur observer to attempt the  construction of his own telescope is a question depending entirely on  his mechanical ability and ingenuity. My own experience of telescope  construction is confined to the conversion of a 3-feet into a 5-1/2-feet  telescope. This operation involved some difficulties, since the aperture  had to be increased by about an inch. I found a tubing made of alternate  layers of card and calico well pasted together, to be both light and  strong. But for the full length of tube I think a core of metal is  wanted. A learned and ingenious friend, Mr. Sharp, Fellow of St. John's  College, informs me that a tube of tin, covered with layers of brown  paper, well pasted and thicker near the middle of the tube, forms a  light and strong telescope-tube, almost wholly free from vibration.    Suffer no inexperienced person to deal with your object-glass. I knew a  valuable glass ruined by the proceedings of a workman who had been told  to attach three pieces of brass round the cell of the double lens. What  he had done remained unknown, but ever after a wretched glare of light  surrounded all objects of any brilliancy.    One word about the inversion of objects by the astronomical telescope.  It is singular that any difficulty should be felt about so simple a  matter, yet I have seen in the writings of more than one distinguished  astronomer, wholly incorrect views as to the nature of the inversion.  One tells us that to obtain the correct presentation from a picture  taken with a telescope, the view should be inverted, held up to the  light, and looked at from the back of the paper. Another tells us to  invert the picture and hold it opposite a looking-glass. Neither method  is correct. The simple correction wanted is to hold the picture upside  down--the same change which brings the top to the bottom brings the  right to the left, _i.e._, fully corrects the inversion.

[Ed.]    ______________________________    CHAPTER II  A CATHOLIC HOUSEHOLD    All the details of my Mother's illness are still fresh in my mind.  I remember especially her last weeks on earth, when Celine and I  felt like poor little exiles. Every morning a friend came to fetch  us, and we spent the day with her. Once, we had not had time to  say our prayers before starting, and on the way my little sister  whispered: \"Must we tell her that we have not said our prayers?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered. So, very timidly, Celine confided our secret to  her, and she exclaimed: \"Well, well, children, you shall say  them.\" Then she took us to a large room, and left us there. Celine  looked at me in amazement. I was equally astonished, and  exclaimed: \"This is not like Mamma, she always said our prayers  with us.\" During the day, in spite of all efforts to amuse us, the  thought of our dear Mother was constantly in our minds. I remember  once, when my sister had an apricot given to her, she leant  towards me and said: \"We will not eat it, I will give it to  Mamma.\" Alas! our beloved Mother was now too ill to eat any  earthly fruit; she would never more be satisfied but by the glory  of Heaven. There she would drink of the mysterious wine which  Jesus, at His Last Supper, promised to share with us in the  Kingdom of His Father.    The touching ceremony of Extreme Unction made a deep impression on  me. I can still see the place where I knelt, and hear my poor  Father's sobs.    My dear Mother died on August 28, 1877, in her forty-sixth year.  The day after her death my Father took me in his arms and said:  \"Come and kiss your dear Mother for the last time.\" Without saying  a word I put my lips to her icy forehead. I do not remember having  cried much, and I did not talk to anyone of all that filled my  heart; I looked and listened in silence, and I saw many things  they would have hidden from me. Once I found myself close to the  coffin in the passage. I stood looking at it for a long time; I  had never seen one before, but I knew what it was. I was so small  that I had to lift up my head to see its whole length, and it  seemed to me very big and very sad.    Fifteen years later I was again standing by another coffin, that  of our holy Mother Genevieve,[1] and I was carried back to the  days of my childhood. Memories crowded upon me; it was the same  little Therese who looked at it, but she had grown, and the coffin  seemed small. She had not to lift up her head to it, now she only  raised her eyes to contemplate Heaven which seemed to her very  full of joy, for trials had matured and strengthened her soul, so  that nothing on earth could make her grieve.    Our Lord did not leave me wholly an orphan; on the day of my  Mother's funeral He gave me another mother, and allowed me to  choose her freely. We were all five together, looking at one  another sadly, when our nurse, overcome with emotion, said,  turning to Celine and to me: \"Poor little dears, you no longer  have a Mother.\" Then Celine threw herself into Marie's arms,  crying: \"Well, you will be my Mother now.\" I was so accustomed to  imitate Celine that I should undoubtedly have followed her  example, but I feared Pauline would be sad and feel herself left  out if she too had not a little daughter. So, with a loving look,  I hid my face on her breast saying in my turn: \"And Pauline will  be my Mother.\"    That day, as I have said, began the second period of my life. It  was the most sorrowful of all, especially after Pauline, my second  Mother, entered the Carmel; and it lasted from the time I was four  years old until I was fourteen, when I recovered much of my  childish gaiety, even though I understood more fully the serious  side of life.    I must tell you that after my Mother's death my naturally happy  disposition completely changed. Instead of being lively and  demonstrative as I had been, I became timid, shy, and extremely  sensitive; a look was enough to make me burst into tears. I could  not bear to be noticed or to meet strangers, and was only at ease  in my own family circle. There I was always cherished with the  most loving care; my Father's affectionate heart seemed endowed  with a mother's love, and my sisters were no less tender and  devoted. If Our Lord had not lavished so much love and sunshine on  His Little Flower, she never could have become acclimatised to  this earth. Still too weak to bear the storm, she needed warmth,  refreshing dew, and soft breezes, and these gifts were never  wanting to her, even in the chilling seasons of trials.    Soon after my Mother's death, Papa made up his mind to leave  Alencon and live at Lisieux, so that we might be near our uncle,  my Mother's brother. He made this sacrifice in order that my young  sisters should have the benefit of their aunt's guidance in their  new life, and that she might act as a mother towards them. I did  not feel any grief at leaving my native town: children love change  and anything out of the common, and so I was pleased to come to  Lisieux. I remember the journey quite well, and our arrival in the  evening at my uncle's house, and I can still see my little  cousins, Jeanne and Marie, waiting on the doorstep with my aunt.  How touching was the affection all these dear ones showed us!    The next day they took us to our new home, _Les Buissonets,_[2]  situated in a quiet part of the town. I was charmed with the house  my Father had taken. The large upper window from which there was  an extensive view, the flower garden in front, and the kitchen  garden at the back--all these seemed delightfully new to my  childish mind; and this happy home became the scene of many joys  and of family gatherings which I can never forget. Elsewhere, as I  said before, I felt an exile, I cried and fretted for my Mother;  but here my little heart expanded, and I smiled on life once more.    When I woke there were my sisters ready to caress me, and I said  my prayers kneeling between them. Then Pauline gave me my reading  lesson, and I remember that \"Heaven\" was the first word I could  read alone. When lessons were over I went upstairs, where Papa was  generally to be found, and how pleased I was when I had good marks  to show. Every afternoon I went out for a walk with him, and we  paid a visit to the Blessed Sacrament in one or other of the  Churches. It was in this way that I first saw the Chapel of the  Carmel: \"Look, little Queen,\" Papa said to me, \"behind that big  grating there are holy nuns who are always praying to Almighty  God.\" Little did I think that nine years later I should be amongst  them, that in this blessed Carmel I should receive so many graces.    On returning home I learnt my lessons, and then spent the rest of  the day playing in the garden near Papa. I never cared for dolls,  but one of my favourite amusements was making coloured mixtures  with seeds and the bark of trees. If the colours were pretty, I  would promptly offer them to Papa in a little cup and entice him  to taste them; then my dearest Father would leave his work and  smilingly pretend to drink. I was very fond of flowers, and amused  myself by making little altars in holes which I happened to find  in the middle of my garden wall. When finished I would run and  call Papa, and he seemed delighted with them. I should never stop  if I told you of the thousand and one incidents of this kind that  I can remember. How shall I make you understand the love that my  Father lavished on his little Queen!    Those were specially happy days for me when I went fishing with my  dear \"King,\" as I used to call him. Sometimes I tried my hand with  a small rod of my own, but generally I preferred to sit on the  grass some distance away. Then my reflections became really deep,  and, without knowing what meditation meant, my soul was absorbed  in prayer. Far-off sounds reached me, the murmuring of the wind,  sometimes a few uncertain notes of music from a military band in  the town a long way off; all this imparted a touch of melancholy  to my thoughts. Earth seemed a place of exile, and I dreamed of  Heaven.    The afternoon passed quickly away, and it was soon time to go  home, but before packing up I would eat the provisions I had  brought in a small basket. Somehow the slices of bread and jam,  prepared by my sisters, looked different; they had seemed so  tempting, and now they looked stale and uninviting. Even such a  trifle as this made the earth seem sadder, and I realised that  only in Heaven will there be unclouded joy.    Speaking of clouds, I remember how one day when we were out, the  blue sky became overcast and a storm came on, accompanied by vivid  lightning. I looked round on every side, so as to lose nothing of  the grand sight. A thunderbolt fell in a field close by, and, far  from feeling the least bit afraid, I was delighted--it seemed that  God was so near. Papa was not so pleased, and put an end to my  reverie, for already the tall grass and daisies, taller than I,  were sparkling with rain-drops, and we had to cross several fields  to reach the road. In spite of his fishing tackle, he carried me  in his arms while I looked down in the beautiful jewelled drops,  almost sorry that I could not be drenched by them.    I do not think I have told you that in our daily walks at Lisieux,  as in Alencon, I often used to give alms to the beggars. One day  we came upon a poor old man who dragged himself painfully along on  crutches. I went up to give him a penny. He looked sadly at me for  a long time, and then, shaking his head with a sorrowful smile, he  refused my alms. I cannot tell you what I felt; I had wished to  help and comfort him, and instead of that, I had, perhaps, hurt  him and caused him pain. He must have guessed my thought, for I  saw him turn round and smile at me when we were some way off.    Just then Papa bought me a cake. I wished very much to run after  the"]]]
