[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#6)"],[1," Self-Subsisting.\" By the righteousness of the one true God! He who is  incapable of speaking in Our presence hath uttered such words as none  among the former generations hath ever spoken, and hath committed such  acts as none of the unbelievers of bygone ages hath ever committed.    56 The very words and deeds of these men bear eloquent testimony to the  truth of My words, if ye be of them that judge with fairness. Whosoever  attributeth the verses of God to sorcery hath not believed in any of His  Messengers, hath lived and laboured in vain, and is accounted of those who  speak that of which they have no knowledge. Say: O servant! Fear God, thy  Creator and thy Fashioner, and transgress not against Him, but judge with  fairness and act with justice. Those whom the Lord hath endued with  knowledge shall find, in the very objections raised by the unbelievers,  conclusive proofs to invalidate their claims and vindicate the truth of  this manifest Light. Say: Would ye repeat that which the unbelievers  uttered when a Message came unto them from their Lord? Woe betide you, O  assemblage of foolish ones, and blighted be your works!    57 O Ancient Beauty! Turn aside from the unbelievers and that which they  possess, and waft over all created things the sweet savours of the  remembrance of Thy Beloved, the Exalted, the Great. This remembrance  quickeneth the world of being and reneweth the temples of all created  things. Say: He, verily, hath established Himself upon the Throne of might  and glory. Whosoever desireth to gaze upon His countenance, lo, behold Him  standing before thee! Blessed be the Lord Who hath revealed Himself in  this shining and luminous Beauty. Whosoever desireth to hearken unto His  melodies, lo, hear them rising from His resplendent and wondrous lips! And  unto whosoever desireth to be illumined by the splendours of His light,  say: Seek the court of His presence, for God hath verily granted you leave  to approach it, as a token of His grace unto all mankind.    58 Say: O people! We shall put to you a question in all truthfulness,  taking God for a witness between you and Us. He, verily, is the Defender  of the righteous. Appear, then, before His Throne of glory and make reply  with justice and fair-mindedness. Is it God Who is potent to achieve His  purpose, or is it ye who enjoy such authority? Is it He Who is truly  unconstrained, as ye imply when ye say that He doeth what He pleaseth and  shall not be asked of His doings, or is it ye who wield such power, and  who merely make such assertions out of blind imitation, as did your  forebears at the appearance of every other Messenger of God?    59 If He be truly unconstrained, behold then how He hath sent down the  Manifestation of His Cause with verses which naught in the heavens or on  the earth can withstand! Such hath been the manner of their revelation  that they have neither peer nor likeness in the world of being, as ye  yourselves beheld and heard when once the Daystar of the world shone forth  above the horizon of 'Iraq with manifest dominion. All things attain their  consummation in the divine verses, and these indeed are the verses of God,  the Sovereign Lord, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Almighty.  Beyond this, He hath been made manifest as the Bearer of a Cause whose  sovereign might is acknowledged by all created things, and this none can  deny save the sinners and the ungodly.    60 Say: O people! Is it your wish to conceal the beauty of the Sun behind  the veils of your own selfish desires, or to prevent the Spirit from  raising its melodies within this sanctified and luminous breast? Fear ye  God, and contend not with Him Who representeth the Godhead. Dispute not  with the One at Whose bidding the letter \"B\" was created and joined with  its mighty foundation.(6) Believe in the Messengers of God and His  sovereign might, and in the Self of God and His majesty. Follow not those  who have repudiated what they had once believed, and who have sought for  themselves a station after their own fancy; these, truly, are of the  ungodly. Bear ye witness unto that whereunto God Himself hath borne  witness, that the company of His favoured ones may be illumined by the  words that issue from your lips. Say: We, verily, believe in that which  was revealed unto the Apostles of old, in that which hath been revealed,  by the power of truth, unto 'Ali,(7) and in that which is now being  revealed from His Throne of glory. Thus doth your Lord instruct you, as a  sign of His favour and as a token of His grace that encompasseth all the  worlds.    61 O Feet of this Temple! We, verily, have wrought you of iron. Stand firm  with such constancy in the Cause of your Lord as to cause the feet of  every severed soul to be strengthened in the path of God, the Almighty,  the All-Wise. Beware lest the storms of enmity and hatred, or the blasts  of the workers of iniquity, cause you to stumble. Be immovable in the  Faith of God, and waver not. We, verily, have called you forth by virtue  of that Name which is the source of all steadfastness, and by the grace of  each one of Our most excellent Names as revealed unto all who are in  heaven and on earth. Erelong shall We bring into being through you other  feet, firm and steadfast, which shall walk unwaveringly in Our path, even  should they be assailed by hosts as formidable as the combined forces of  the former and latter generations. In truth, We hold all grace in the  hollow of Our hand, and bestow it as We please upon Our favoured servants.  Time and again have We vouchsafed unto you Our favours, that ye may offer  such thanks unto your Lord as to cause the tongues of all created things  to speak forth in praise of Me, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.    62 O Living Temple! Arise to serve this Cause through a might and a power  born of Us. Disclose, then, unto the servants of God all that the Spirit  of God, the sovereign Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Glorious, the  All-Wise, hath imparted unto Thee. Say: O people! Will ye turn away from  Him Who is the Eternal Truth, and choose instead him whom We have created  out of a mere handful of clay? To do so is to inflict a grievous injustice  upon yourselves, if ye be of them that reflect upon the verses of your  Lord. Say: O people! Cleanse your hearts and your eyes, that ye may  recognize your Maker in this holy and luminous attire. Say: The celestial  Youth hath ascended the Throne of glory, made manifest His independent  sovereignty, and now voiceth, in the most sweet and wondrous accents, this  call betwixt earth and heaven: \"O peoples of the earth! Wherefore have ye  disbelieved in your Lord, the All-Merciful, and turned aside from Him Who  is the Beauty of the All-Glorious? By the righteousness of God! This is  His Hidden Secret, Who hath risen from the dayspring of creation; and this  is His cherished Beauty, Who hath shone forth above the horizon of this  exalted Station, invested with the sovereignty of God, the Help in Peril,  the All-Glorious, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.\"    63 O Temple of Holiness! We, verily, have cleansed Thy breast from the  whisperings of the people and sanctified it from earthly allusions, that  the light of My beauty may appear therein and be reflected in the mirrors  of all the worlds. Thus have We singled Thee out above all that hath been  created in the heavens and the earth, and above all that hath been decreed  in the realms of revelation and creation, and chosen Thee for Our own  Self. This is but an evidence of the bounty which God hath vouchsafed unto  Thee, a bounty which shall last until the Day that hath no end in this  contingent world. It shall endure so long as God, the Supreme King, the  Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Wise, shall endure. For the Day of God is  none other but His own Self, Who hath appeared with the power of truth.  This is the Day that shall not be followed by night, nor shall it be  bounded by any praise, would that ye might understand!    64 O Breast of this Temple! We, verily, have caused all things to mirror  forth thy reality, and made thee as a mirror of Our own Self. Shed, then,  upon the breasts of all created beings the splendours of the light of thy  Lord, that they may be freed from all allusions and limitations. Thus hath  the Daystar of wisdom shone forth above the horizon of the Pen of the  Eternal King. Blessed are those who perceive it! Through thee have We  created other sanctified breasts, and unto thee shall We cause them to  return, as a token of Our grace unto thee and unto Our favoured servants.  Erelong shall We bring into being through thee men with sanctified and  illumined breasts, who will testify to naught save My beauty and show  forth naught but the resplendent light of My countenance. These shall in  truth be the mirrors of My Names amidst all created things.    65 O Temple of Holiness! We, verily, have made Thine inmost heart the  treasury of all the knowledge of past and future ages, and the  dawning-place of Our own knowledge which We have ordained for the dwellers  of earth and heaven, that all creation may partake of the outpourings of  Thy grace and may attain, through the wonders of Thy knowledge, unto the  recognition of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great. In truth, that  knowledge which belongeth unto Mine own Essence is such as none hath ever  attained or will ever grasp, nor shall any heart be capable of bearing its  weight. Were We to disclose but a single word of this knowledge, the  hearts of all men would be filled with consternation, the foundations of  all things would crumble into ruin, and the feet of even the wisest among  men would be made to slip.    66 Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lieth unrevealed a knowledge,  one word of which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every  human being to recognize the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His  omniscience, would enable every one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#6)"],[1,"  the people of the past to err and by whom were they misled? They still  reject the truth and have turned towards their own selfish desires. This  Wronged One calleth aloud for the sake of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him  turn thereunto; whosoever wisheth, let him turn away. Verily God can well  afford to dispense with all things, whether of the past or of the future.    O people of the Bayan! It is men like unto Hadi Dawlat-Abadi(6) who, with  turban and staff,(7) have been the source of opposition and hindrance and  have so grievously burdened the people with superstitions that even at the  present time they still expect the appearance of a fictitious person from  a fictitious place. Be ye warned, O men of understanding.    O Hadi! Give ear unto the Voice of this trustworthy Counsellor: direct thy  steps from the left unto the right, that is turn away from idle fancy unto  certitude. Lead not the people into error. The divine Luminary shineth,  His Cause is manifest and His signs are all-embracing. Set thy face  towards God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Renounce thy  leadership for the sake of God and leave the people unto themselves. Thou  art ignorant of the essential truth, thou art not acquainted therewith.    O Hadi! Be thou of one face in the path of God. When in company with the  infidels, thou art an infidel and with the pious, thou art pious. Reflect  thou upon such souls as offered up their lives and their substance in that  land, that haply thou mayest be admonished and roused from slumber.  Consider: who is to be preferred, he who preserveth his body, his life and  his possessions or the one who surrendereth his all in the path of God?  Judge thou fairly and be not of the unjust. Take fast hold of justice and  adhere unto equity that perchance thou mayest not, for selfish motives,  use religion as a snare, nor disregard the truth for the sake of gold.  Indeed thine iniquity and the iniquity of such people as thyself have  waxed so grievous that the Pen of Glory was moved to make such  observations. Fear thou God. He Who heralded this Revelation hath  declared: 'He shall proclaim under all conditions: \"Verily, verily, I am  God, no God is there but Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\"'    O people of the Bayan! Ye have been forbidden to contact the loved ones of  God. Why hath this ban been imposed and for what purpose? Be ye fair, I  adjure you by God, and be not of the heedless. Unto such as are endued  with insight, and before the Most Great Beauty, the object of this ban is  known and evident; it is so that no one may become aware of his (Hadi's)  secrets and deeds.    O Hadi! Thou hast not been in Our company, thou art therefore ignorant of  the Cause. Act not according to thine idle imaginings. Aside from these  things, scrutinize the Writings with thine own eyes and ponder upon that  which hath come to pass. Have pity upon thyself and upon the servants of  God and be not the cause of waywardness like unto the people aforetime.  The path is unmistakable and the proof is evident. Change injustice into  justice and inequity into equity. We cherish the hope that the breaths of  divine inspiration may strengthen thee and that thine inner ear may be  enabled to hear the blessed words: 'Say, it is God, then leave them to  entertain themselves with their cavillings.'(8) Thou has been there  (Cyprus) and hast seen him (Mirza Yahya). Now speak forth with fairness.  Do not misrepresent the matter, neither to thyself nor to the people. Thou  art both ignorant and uninformed. Give ear unto the Voice of this Wronged  One and hasten towards the ocean of divine knowledge that perchance thou  mayest be adorned with the ornament of comprehension and mayest renounce  all else but God. Hearken unto the Voice of this benevolent Counsellor,  calling aloud, unveiled and manifest, before the faces of kings and their  subjects, and summon the people of the world, one and all, unto Him Who is  the Lord of Eternity. This is the Word from Whose horizon the day-star of  unfailing grace shineth resplendent.    O Hadi! This Wronged One, rid of all attachment to the world, hath striven  with utmost endeavour to quench the fire of animosity and hatred which  burneth fiercely in the hearts of the peoples of the earth. It behoveth  every just and fair-minded person to render thanks unto God--exalted be His  glory--and to arise to promote this pre-eminent Cause, that fire may turn  into light, and hatred may give way to fellowship and love. I swear by the  righteousness of God! This is the sole purpose of this Wronged One. Indeed  in proclaiming this momentous Cause and in demonstrating its Truth We have  endured manifold sufferings, hardships and tribulations. Thou thyself  wouldst bear witness unto that which We have mentioned, couldst thou but  speak with fairness. Verily God speaketh the truth and leadeth the Way. He  is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Gracious.    May Our Glory rest upon the people of Baha whom neither the tyranny of the  oppressor nor the ascendancy of the aggressor have been able to withhold  from God, the Lord of the worlds.                                     TAJALLIYAT (EFFULGENCES)      This is the Epistle of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting    He is the One Who heareth from His Realm of Glory.    GOD testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who hath  appeared is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, the Most Great Book  for all peoples, and the Heaven of bounty for the whole world. He is the  Most Mighty Sign amongst men and the Dayspring of the most august  attributes in the realm of creation. Through Him hath appeared that which  had been hidden from time immemorial and been veiled from the eyes of men.  He is the One Whose Manifestation was announced by the heavenly  Scriptures, in former times and more recently. Whoso acknowledgeth belief  in Him and in His signs and testimonies hath in truth acknowledged that  which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven  and the revelation of the Kingdom of Names. Through Him the ocean of  knowledge hath surged amidst mankind and the river of divine wisdom hath  gushed out at the behest of God, the Lord of Days.    Well is it with the man of discernment who hath recognized and perceived  the Truth, and the one possessed of a hearing ear who hath hearkened unto  His sweet Voice, and the hand that hath received His Book with such  resolve as is born of God, the Lord of this world and of the next, and the  earnest wayfarer who hath hastened unto His glorious Horizon, and the one  endued with strength whom neither the overpowering might of the rulers,  nor the tumult raised by the leaders of religion hath been able to shake.  And woe betide him who hath rejected the grace of God and His bounty, and  hath denied His tender mercy and authority; such a man is indeed reckoned  with those who have throughout eternity repudiated the testimony of God  and His proof.    Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the things  current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is ordained by God, the  Lord of Names and the Fashioner of all created things, He Who is come from  the heaven of eternity through the power of the Most Great Name, invested  with so invincible an authority that all the powers of the earth are  unable to withstand Him. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book,  calling from the Most Sublime Station.    O 'Ali-Akbar!(9) We have repeatedly heard thy voice and have responded to  thee with that which the praise of all mankind can never rival; from which  the sincere ones inhale the sweet savours of the sayings of the  All-Merciful, and His true lovers perceive the fragrance of heavenly  reunion, and the sore athirst discover the murmuring of the water that is  life indeed. Blessed the man who hath attained thereto and hath recognized  that which is at this moment being diffused from the Pen of God, the Help  in Peril, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.    We testify that thou hast set thy face towards God and travelled far until  thou didst attain His presence and gavest ear unto the Voice of this  Wronged One, Who hath been cast into prison through the misdeeds of those  who have disbelieved in the signs and testimonies of God and have denied  this heavenly grace through which the whole world hath been made to shine.  Blessed thy face, for it hath turned unto Him, and thine ear, for it hath  heard His Voice, and thy tongue, for it hath celebrated the praise of God,  the Lord of lords. We pray God to graciously aid thee to become a standard  for the promotion of His Cause and to enable thee to draw nigh unto Him at  all times and under all conditions.    The chosen ones of God and His loved ones in that land are remembered by  Us, and We give them the joyful tidings of that which hath been sent down  in their honour from the Kingdom of the utterance of their Lord, the  sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning. Make mention of Me to them and  illumine them with the resplendent glory of Mine utterance. Verily thy  Lord is the Gracious, the Bountiful.    O thou who dost magnify My praise! Give ear unto that which the people of  tyranny ascribe unto Me in My days. Some of them say: 'He hath laid claim  to divinity'; others say: 'He hath devised a lie against God'; still  others say: 'He is come to foment sedition'. Base and wretched are they.  Lo! They are, in truth, enslaved to idle imaginings.    We shall now cease using the eloquent language.(10) Truly thy Lord is the  Potent, the Unconstrained. We would fain speak in the Persian tongue that  perchance the people of Persia, one and all, may become aware of the  utterances of the merciful Lord, and come forth to discover the Truth.    The first Tajalli which hath dawned from the Day-Star of Truth is the  knowledge of God--exalted be His glory. And the knowledge of the King of  everlasting days can in no"]]]
