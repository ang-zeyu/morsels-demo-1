[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#6)"],[1,"was created.  That is  why, sir, I must be on my guard.\"    The crew were on their feet all night.  No one thought of sleep.  The  Abraham Lincoln, not being able to struggle with such velocity, had  moderated its pace, and sailed at half speed.  For its part, the  narwhal, imitating the frigate, let the waves rock it at will, and  seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle.  Towards  midnight, however, it disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term,  it \"died out\" like a large glow-worm. Had it fled?  One could only  fear, not hope it.  But at seven minutes to one o'clock in the morning  a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water  rushing with great violence.    The captain, Ned Land, and I were then on the poop, eagerly peering  through the profound darkness.    \"Ned Land,\" asked the commander, \"you have often heard the roaring of  whales?\"    \"Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two  thousand dollars.  If I can only approach within four harpoons' length  of it!\"    \"But to approach it,\" said the commander, \"I ought to put a whaler at  your disposal?\"    \"Certainly, sir.\"    \"That will be trifling with the lives of my men.\"    \"And mine too,\" simply said the harpooner.    Towards two o'clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not  less intense, about five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln.  Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one  heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal's tail, and even its  panting breath.  It seemed that, at the moment that the enormous  narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air  was engulfed in its lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a  machine of two thousand horse-power.    \"Hum!\" thought I, \"a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment  would be a pretty whale!\"    We were on the qui vive till daylight, and prepared for the combat.  The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings.  The  second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses, which could throw harpoons  to the distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets,  which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals.  Ned  Land contented himself with sharpening his harpoon--a terrible weapon  in his hands.    At six o'clock day began to break; and, with the first glimmer of  light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared.  At seven o'clock  the day was sufficiently advanced, but a very thick sea fog obscured  our view, and the best spy glasses could not pierce it.  That caused  disappointment and anger.    I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the  mast-heads. At eight o'clock the fog lay heavily on the waves, and its  thick scrolls rose little by little.  The horizon grew wider and  clearer at the same time.  Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned  Land's voice was heard:    \"The thing itself on the port quarter!\" cried the harpooner.    Every eye was turned towards the point indicated.  There, a mile and a  half from the frigate, a long blackish body emerged a yard above the  waves.  Its tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy.  Never did a tail beat the sea with such violence.  An immense track, of  dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of the animal, and described a  long curve.    The frigate approached the cetacean.  I examined it thoroughly.    The reports of the Shannon and of the Helvetia had rather exaggerated  its size, and I estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty  feet.  As to its dimensions, I could only conjecture them to be  admirably proportioned.  While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of  steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of  120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing.  I concluded  definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch, class mammalia.    The crew waited impatiently for their chief's orders.  The latter,  after having observed the animal attentively, called the engineer.  The  engineer ran to him.    \"Sir,\" said the commander, \"you have steam up?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered the engineer.    \"Well, make up your fires and put on all steam.\"    Three hurrahs greeted this order.  The time for the struggle had  arrived.  Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited  torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of  the boilers.    The Abraham Lincoln, propelled by her wonderful screw, went straight at  the animal.  The latter allowed it to come within half a cable's  length; then, as if disdaining to dive, it took a little turn, and  stopped a short distance off.    This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the  frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean.  It was quite evident that  at that rate we should never come up with it.    \"Well, Mr. Land,\" asked the captain, \"do you advise me to put the boats  out to sea?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Ned Land; \"because we shall not take that beast  easily.\"    \"What shall we do then?\"    \"Put on more steam if you can, sir.  With your leave, I mean to post  myself under the bowsprit, and, if we get within harpooning distance, I  shall throw my harpoon.\"    \"Go, Ned,\" said the captain.  \"Engineer, put on more pressure.\"    Ned Land went to his post.  The fires were increased, the screw  revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the  valves.  We heaved the log, and calculated that the Abraham Lincoln was  going at the rate of 18 1/2 miles an hour.    But the accursed animal swam at the same speed.    For a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace, without gaining six  feet.  It was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the  American navy.  A stubborn anger seized the crew; the sailors abused  the monster, who, as before, disdained to answer them; the captain no  longer contented himself with twisting his beard--he gnawed it.    The engineer was called again.    \"You have turned full steam on?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the engineer.    The speed of the Abraham Lincoln increased.  Its masts trembled down to  their stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out  of the narrow funnels.    They heaved the log a second time.    \"Well?\" asked the captain of the man at the wheel.    \"Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir.\"    \"Clap on more steam.\"    The engineer obeyed.  The manometer showed ten degrees.  But the  cetacean grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it  made 19 3/10 miles.    What a pursuit!  No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated  through me.  Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand.  Several times  the animal let us gain upon it.--\"We shall catch it! we shall catch  it!\" cried the Canadian.  But just as he was going to strike, the  cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less  than thirty miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it  bullied the frigate, going round and round it.  A cry of fury broke  from everyone!    At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o'clock in the  morning.    The captain then decided to take more direct means.    \"Ah!\" said he, \"that animal goes quicker than the Abraham Lincoln.  Very well! we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets.  Send your men to the forecastle, sir.\"    The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round.  But the  shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off.    \"Another, more to the right,\" cried the commander, \"and five dollars to  whoever will hit that infernal beast.\"    An old gunner with a grey beard--that I can see now--with steady eye  and grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim.  A loud report  was heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew.    The bullet did its work; it hit the animal, and, sliding off the  rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea.    The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said:    \"I will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up.\"    \"Yes,\" answered I; \"and you will be quite right to do it.\"    I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to  fatigue like a steam engine.  But it was of no use.  Hours passed,  without its showing any signs of exhaustion.    However, it must be said in praise of the Abraham Lincoln that she  struggled on indefatigably.  I cannot reckon the distance she made  under three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th.  But night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean.    Now I thought our expedition was at an end, and that we should never  again see the extraordinary animal.  I was mistaken.  At ten minutes to  eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to  windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding  night.    The narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with its day's work, it  slept, letting itself float with the undulation of the waves.  Now was  a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage.    He gave his orders.  The Abraham Lincoln kept up half steam, and  advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary.  It is no rare  thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that  they can be successfully attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than  one during its sleep.  The Canadian went to take his place again under  the bowsprit.    The frigate approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables' lengths from  the animal, and following its track.  No one breathed; a deep silence  reigned on the bridge.  We were not a hundred feet from the burning  focus, the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes.    At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned  Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible  harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal.  Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#6)"],[1,"will recur later to these transformations of the Diptera. For  the present, we pursue our survey of changes in the life-history of the  Lepidoptera and can take to guide us the excellent researches of J.  Gonin (1894).    Careful study of the imaginal discs of the wings in a caterpillar (fig.  10) made by examining microscopically sections cut through them, shows  that the epidermis is pushed in to form a little pouch (_C, p_) and that  into this grows the actual wing-rudiment. Consequently the whitish disk  which seems to lie within the body-wall of the larva, is really a  double fold of the epidermis, the outer fold forming the pouch, the  inner the actual wing-bud. Into the cavity of the latter pass branches  from the air-tube system. In its earliest stage, the wing-bud is simply  an ingrowing mass of cells (fig. 10 _A_) which subsequently becomes an  inpushed pouch (_B_). Until the last stage of larval life the wing-bud  remains hidden in its pouch, and no cuticle is formed over it. When the  pupal stage draws near the bud grows out of its sheath, and projecting  from the general surface of the epidermis becomes covered with cuticle  to be revealed, as we have seen, after the last larval moult, as the  pupal wing. Thus all through the life of the humble, crawling  caterpillar, 'it doth not yet appear what it shall be,' but there are  being prepared, hidden and unseen, the wondrous organs of flight, which  in due time will equip the insect for the glorious aerial existence that  awaits it.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. A, B, C, Sections through epidermis and cuticle,  showing three stages in growth of the imaginal disc (_w_) of a wing in  the caterpillar of a White Butterfly (_Pieris_). _ep_, epidermis; _cu_,  cuticle; _t_, air-tube, whence branches pass into the developing wing.  In C, _cu'_ represents the new cuticle forming beneath the old one, and  (_p_) the pouch within which the wing-disc (_w_) lies. Highly magnified.  After Gonin, _Bull. Soc. Vaud._ XXX.]    As mentioned above, this hidden growth of the wing-rudiments, in  butterflies, beetles, flies, bees, and the great majority of the winged  insects, has been emphasised by Sharp (1899) as a character contrasting  markedly with the outward and visible growth of the wing-rudiments in  such insects as cockroaches, bugs, and dragon-flies. The divergence  between the two modes of development is certainly very striking, and a  conceivable method of transition from the one to the other is not easy  to explain. Sharp has expressed the divergence by the terms  _Endopterygota_, applied to all the orders of insects with hidden  wing-rudiments (the 'Metabola' or 'Holometabola' of most  classifications) and _Exopterygota_, including all those insects whose  wing-rudiments are visible throughout growth ('Hemimetabola' and  'Ametabola'). Those curious lowly insects, belonging to the two orders  of the Collembola and Thysanura, none of whose members ever develop  wings at all, form a third sub-class, the _Apterygota_ (see  Classificatory Table, p. 122).    Not the wings only, but other structures of the imago, varying in extent  in different orders, are formed from the imaginal discs. For example, de  Reaumur and G. Newport (1839) found that if the thoracic leg of a  late-stage caterpillar were cut off, the corresponding leg of the  resulting butterfly would still be developed, although in a truncated  condition. Gonin has shown that in the Cabbage White butterfly (_Pieris  brassicae_) the legs of the imago are represented, through the greater  part of larval life, only by small groups of cells situated within the  bases of the larval legs. After the third moult these imaginal discs  grow rapidly and the proximal portion of each, destined to develop into  the thigh and shin of the butterfly's leg, sinks into a depression at  the side of the thorax, while the tip of the shin and the  five-segmented foot project into the cavity of the larval leg. Hence we  understand that the amputation of the latter by the old naturalists  truncated only and did not destroy the imaginal limb. In the blow-fly  maggot, Weismann, B.T. Lowne (1890) and J. Van Rees (1888) have shown  that the imaginal discs of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) grow out from  deep dermal inpushings. Simple at first, these outgrowths by partial  splitting, become differentiated into thigh and shin.    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Front region of Maggot of Blow-fly  (_Calliphora_) showing diagrammatically the imaginal discs, which are  shaded. _e_, eye; _f_, feeler; _W_, fore-wing; _w_, hind-wing; 1, 2, 3,  legs. _H_ is the 'cephalic vesicle,' which becomes everted at the close  of the metamorphosis, so as to bring the feelers and eyes to the front,  the brain (_B_) moving forwards at the same time. After Van Rees, _Zool.  Jahrb._ 1894, and Lowne's _Blow-fly_.]    Similarly the feelers and jaws of the butterfly are developed from  imaginal discs, and this fact explains how it comes to pass that they  differ so widely from the corresponding structures in the caterpillar.  The larval feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are short and stumpy, those of the  butterfly long and many-jointed. The maxilla of the larva (fig. 3 _Mx_)  consists of a base carrying two short jointed processes; in the  butterfly a certain portion of the maxilla, the hood or galea, is  modified into a long, flexible grooved process, capable of forming with  its fellow the trunk through which the insect sucks its liquid food  (fig. 2). Nothing but some such provision as that of the imaginal discs  could render possible the wonderful replacement of the caterpillar's  jaws, biting solid food, into those of the butterfly sipping nectar from  flowers.    A curious segmental displacement of the imaginal discs with regard to  the larva is noticeable in some Diptera. In the larva of the  harlequin-midge (Chironomus) as described by Miall and Hammond (1900)  the brain is situated in the thorax, and the imaginal discs for the  head, eyes, and feelers of the adult lie in close association with it,  though they arise from inpushings of the larval head. These rudiments do  not appear until the last larval stage has been reached. In the gnats  Culex and Corethra, on the other hand, the imaginal discs for the  head-appendages retain their normal position within the larval head, and  appear in an early stage of larval life. Among the flies of the  bluebottle group (Muscidae) the brain (fig. 11 _B_) is situated, as in  Chironomus, in the thoracic region of the legless maggot, which is the  larva of an insect of this family, and the imaginal discs for eyes and  feelers (fig. 11 _e_, _f_) lie just in front of it. Here, the imaginal  buds of the legs (fig. 11--1, 2, 3) and wings (fig. 11 _W_, _w_) are  deeply inpushed, retaining their connection with the skin only by means  of a thread of cells. As the larva is legless and headless its outer  form is not affected by the discs and it is not surprising to learn that  they appear early. It has indeed been suggested that the pharyngeal  region of the larva, in connection with which the imaginal head-discs  are developed, should be regarded, though it lies in the thorax, as an  inpushed anterior section of the larval head. In any case this region is  pushed out during the formation of the pupa within the final larval  cuticle, so that the imaginal head with its contained brain, its  compound eyes, and its complex feelers, takes its rightful place at the  front end of the insect.    The mention of the brain suggests a few brief remarks on the changes in  the internal organs during insect transformation. There are no imaginal  discs for the nervous system; the brain, nerve-cords and ganglia of the  butterfly or bluebottle are the direct outcome of those of the  caterpillar or maggot. More than seventy years ago, Newport (1839)  traced the rapid but continuous changes, which, during the early pupal  period, convert the elongate nerve-cord of the caterpillar with its  relatively far-separated ganglia into the shortened, condensed  nerve-cord of the Tortoise-shell butterfly (_Vanessa urticae_) with  several of the ganglia coalesced. In many Diptera, on the other hand,  the nervous system of the larva is more concentrated than that of the  imago.    The tubular heart also of a winged insect is the directly modified  survival of the larval heart.    Similarly the reproductive organs undergo a gradual, continuous  development throughout an insect's life-story. Their rudiments appear in  the embryo, often at a very early stage; they are recognisable in the  larva, and the matured structures in the imago are the result of their  slow process of growth, the details of which must be reckoned beyond the  scope of this book. For a full summary of the subject the reader is  referred to L.F. Henneguy's work (1904) containing references to much  important modern literature, which cannot be mentioned here.    On the other hand, the digestive system of insects that undergo a  metamorphosis, passes through a profound crisis of dissolution and  rebuilding. This is not surprising when we remember that there is often  a great difference between larva and imago in the nature of the food.  The digestive canal of a caterpillar runs a fairly straight course  through the body and consists of a gullet, stomach (mid-gut),  intestine, and rectum; it is adapted for the digestion of solid food. In  the butterfly there is one outgrowth of the gullet in the head--a  pharyngeal sac adapted for sucking liquids; and another outgrowth at the  hinder end of the gullet (which is much longer than in the larva)--a  crop or food-reservoir lying in the abdomen. The intestine of the  butterfly also is longer than that of the larva, being coiled or  twisted. Towards the end of the last larval stage, the cells of the  inner coat (epithelium) lining the stomach begin to undergo  degeneration, small replacing cells appearing between their bases and  later giving rise to the more"]]]
