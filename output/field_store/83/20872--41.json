[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17215"],[0,"Rembrandt (#6)"],[1,"; and his own portrait, painted in 1667, two years before  his death. \"His _Anatomy Lesson_,\" says M. Michel, \"was the glorification  of Science itself; in his _Sortie of a Company of Amsterdam Musketeers_ he  embodied that civic heroism which had lately compassed Dutch independence;  and in a group of five cloth merchants seated round a table, discussing  the affairs of their guild, he summed up, as it were, in a few immortal  types, the noble sincerity of Dutch portraiture.\"    _The Anatomy Lesson_ was the picture that gave Rembrandt his opportunity,  and proclaimed his preeminence among the painters in Amsterdam. It was the  custom in those days for corporations, civic bodies, and associations of  various kinds, to commemorate their period of office by commissioning  portrait groups which should hand down their worthy faces to posterity. The  desire of the less prominent members of the associations thus painted was  that each head should be a likeness, plainly recognisable,--that one  burgher should not be treated with more importance than another. This  desire for present and posthumous commemoration extended to medical  circles. Portraits and portrait groups of famous physicians and surgeons  were painted and hung in the theatres where they lectured or operated. Dr.  Tulp, an eminent surgeon of the day, commissioned Rembrandt to represent  him performing an operation, proposing to present the picture to the  Surgeons' Guild in memory of his professorship. The grave, realistic  picture called _The Anatomy Lesson_, now hanging at the Hague Museum, was  the result. The corpse lies upon the dissecting table; before it stands Dr.  Tulp, wearing a broad-brimmed hat; around him are grouped seven elderly  students. Some are absorbed by the operation, others gaze thoughtfully at  the professor, or at the spectator. Dr. Tulp indicates with his forceps one  of the tendons of the subject's left arm, and appears to be addressing the  students, or practitioners, for these seven bearded men have long passed  the age of studentship. This picture made Rembrandt's reputation. He was  but twenty-six; the world seemed to be at his feet; in the two following  years he painted forty portraits.    It was not easy for our enthusiast to explain to the ladies of the Dorcas  meeting that the dissection of a body was a suitable subject for the brush  of a painter. The Dutchmen of Rembrandt's day were not so squeamish as we  have become since. They had a passion for the literal painting of literal  things, and this picture was destined not for a Tate Gallery, but for the  wall of an operating theatre. Dr. Tulp desired a picture of himself  performing an operation, and Rembrandt gave it to him, painted in a way  that pleased his contemporaries, and that has astonished the world ever  since.    Ten years later Rembrandt painted another Doelen or Regent picture which,  under the erroneous title of _The Night Watch_, is to-day the chief  attraction of the Ryks Museum at Amsterdam. This time it was not a group of  surgeons, but a company of Amsterdam musketeers marching out under the  leadership of their captain, Frans Banning Cocq. In all these civic or  military Regent pictures, each member subscribed a sum towards the artist's  fee, and consequently each individual wished to have his money's worth in  the shape of an accurate presentation of his face and form. It is an old  quarrel between artist and public. Mr. Abbey had to face it in his  Coronation picture; Mr. Bacon had to face it in his _Return of the  C.I.V.'s_; perhaps the only folk who solved the problem were the  complaisant gentlemen who designed panoramas of cricket matches in the last  century, where each member of the company blandly faces the spectator. Much  water had flowed under Burgomaster Six's bridge since Rembrandt painted  _The Anatomy Lesson_. Then he was the obedient student. Now he was an  acknowledged master. He painted _The Sortie of the Company of Frans Banning  Cocq_ as an artist who was profoundly interested in problems of light and  shade, with strong views as to the composition of a picture, not as a  methodical and mediocre painter desirous of carrying out the commission in  a way to please his patrons. They wanted a presentment of the face and  figure of each member of the company who had subscribed a hundred florins.  Rembrandt gave them a work of art. No doubt the captain and his lieutenant  were well enough pleased, for they stride forth in the forefront of the  picture, but the rank and file were bitterly hostile. From the painting of  _The Night Watch_ his popularity began to wane.    The history of this picture, after it had been hung in the Doelen or  assembly hall belonging to Captain Cocq's company, was as troublous as the  later life of Rembrandt. Years afterwards when, blackened with smoke and  ill-usage, it was removed from the Doelen to the Hotel de Ville, the  authorities, finding that it was too large for the space it was destined to  occupy, deliberately cut a piece away from each side. This is proved by a  copy of the picture made by Lundens before the mutilation, now in the  National Gallery. When M. Hopman undertook the restoration of _The Night  Watch_ he discovered, when he had removed the surface of dirt, that the  sortie is taking place by daylight, and that the work contained something  that Rembrandt evidently intended should represent a ray of sunlight. But  the popular name of the picture is still _The Night Watch_.    The ladies of the Dorcas Society expressed in eyes and gestures their  disapproval of the Amsterdam vandals who mutilated _The Night Watch_. One  of them remarked: \"It happened a long time ago. So gross a barbarity could  not be perpetrated now.\"    Twenty years later, at the age of fifty-six, Rembrandt, having known what  it was to be homeless and penniless, painted his masterpiece, _The Syndics  of the Cloth Hall_, merely five figures grouped round a table, with a  servant, uncovered, in attendance. It is an extraordinarily real picture,  the final statement of Rembrandt's knowledge of painting, combined with  that rare power of seeing things just as they are--the hundred subtleties  that the untrained eye never sees, as well as the accents that all see. It  is the perfect painter's vision--a scene grasped as a whole, character  searched out but not insistent, the most delicate suggestion of equally  diffused light knitting the figures together. He made no attempt to be  picturesque as in _The Night Watch_; he was content just to paint five men  dressed in black, with flat white collars and broad-brimmed hats, and a  servant. With these simple materials Rembrandt produced the picture that  the world has agreed to regard as his masterpiece. Contemporary criticism  says nothing about it. The place of honour at the Ryks Museum at Amsterdam  is given to _The Night Watch_, but it is _The Syndics of the Cloth Hall_--a  simple presentation of five grave men seated at a table--that we remember  with wonder and admiration.    Our enthusiast, having dwelt upon these three masterpieces, marking epochs  in Rembrandt's life, referred again to the magnificent array of portraits  scattered in such regal profusion through the thirty years that passed  between the painting of _The Anatomy Lesson_ and _The Syndics_. Then  noticing, while enlarging upon the etchings, that his mother was casting  anxious glances at the clock, he hurriedly referred to the last portrait  that Rembrandt painted of himself, two years before his death. He could not  describe this portrait, which is in a private collection in Berlin, as he  had never seen it, so he quoted M. Michel's description: \"This  extraordinary work, perhaps the last Rembrandt painted, is modelled with  prodigious vigour and freedom. With superb audacity, the master shows us  once more the familiar features, on which age and sorrow have worked their  will. They are distorted, disfigured, almost unrecognisable. But the free  spirit is still unbroken. The eyes that meet ours are still keen and  piercing; they have even the old twinkle of good-humoured irony, and the  toothless mouth relaxes in frank laughter. What was the secret of this  gaiety? In spite of his poverty, he had still a corner in which to paint.  Beside him stand an easel and an antique bust, perhaps a relic of his  former wealth. He holds his maul-stick in his hand, and pauses for a moment  in his work. He is happy because he can give himself up to his art.\"    [Illustration: THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS    1634. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    It was the last of half a hundred portraits of himself, painted and etched  without vanity; painted because a man's self is such an accommodating  model, always ready and willing; painted because Rembrandt loved to  experiment with himself before a mirror, grimacing, angry, stern, \"as an  officer,\" \"with a casque,\" \"with a gorget,\" or, as we see him in the  National Gallery, on one wall with the bloom of youth and health upon his  face, on the other, dulled, stained, and marked by the finger of time. This  we can say: that he was always true to himself.          CHAPTER V    THE GREAT TRIUMVIRATE      It is generally acknowledged that the greatest masters of painting that the  world has known are Titian, Velasquez, and Rembrandt, and to each of the  triumvirate we apply the word genius. Among the many definitions of that  abused word is one which states that genius consists not in seeing more  than other people, but in seeing differently. We acknowledge genius in a  painter when, over and above masterly technical power, he presents to us a  view of life or of nature which we may never have seen, but which we are  convinced is the vision of deeper eyes than our own, and is true. The seer  has seen it, and it is only because of the dimness or narrowness or  worldliness of our outlook that we do not perceive it also.    A great painter writes us a letter, tells us of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#6)"],[1,"ministry of the Word for the young and the mass of poor people, yet  that the resting be not so strictly interpreted as to forbid any other  incidental work that cannot be avoided.    Accordingly, when asked, What is meant by the commandment: Thou shalt  sanctify the holy day? answer: To sanctify the holy day is the same as  to keep it holy. But what is meant by keeping it holy? Nothing else  than to be occupied in holy words, works, and life. For the day needs  no sanctification for itself; for in itself it has been created holy  [from the beginning of the creation it was sanctified by its Creator].  But God desires it to be holy to you. Therefore it becomes holy or  unholy on your account, according as you are occupied on the same with  things that are holy or unholy.    How, then, does such sanctification take place? Not in this manner,  that [with folded hands] we sit behind the stove and do no rough  [external] work, or deck ourselves with a wreath and put on our best  clothes, but (as has been said) that we occupy ourselves with God's  Word, and exercise ourselves therein.    And, indeed, we Christians ought always to keep such a holy day, and be  occupied with nothing but holy things, i.e., daily be engaged upon  God's Word, and carry it in our hearts and upon our lips. But (as has  been said) since we do not at all times have leisure, we must devote  several hours a week for the sake of the young, or at least a day for  the sake of the entire multitude, to being concerned about this alone,  and especially urge the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's  Prayer, and thus direct our whole life and being according to God's  Word. At whatever time, then, this is being observed and practiced,  there a true holy day is being kept; otherwise it shall not be called a  Christians' holy day. For, indeed, non-Christians can also cease from  work and be idle, just as the entire swarm of our ecclesiastics, who  stand daily in the churches, singing, and ringing bells but keeping no  holy day holy, because they neither preach nor practices God's Word,  but teach and live contrary to it.    For the Word of God is the sanctuary above all sanctuaries, yea, the  only one which we Christians know and have. For though we had the bones  of all the saints or all holy and consecrated garments upon a heap,  still that would help us nothing; for all that is a dead thing which  can sanctify nobody. But God's Word is the treasure which sanctifies  everything, and by which even all the saints themselves were  sanctified. At whatever hour then, God's Word is taught, preached,  heard, read or meditated upon, there the person, day, and work are  sanctified thereby, not because of the external work, but because of  the Word which makes saints of us all. Therefore I constantly say that  all our life and work must be ordered according to God's Word, if it is  to be God-pleasing or holy. Where this is done, this commandment is in  force and being fulfilled.    On the contrary, any observance or work that is practiced without  God's Word is unholy before God, no matter how brilliantly it may  shine! even though it be covered with relics, such as the fictitious  spiritual orders which know nothing of God's Word and seek holiness in  their own works. Note, therefore, that the force and power of this  commandment lies not in the resting but in the sanctifying so that to  this day belongs a special holy exercise. For other works and  occupations are not properly called holy exercises, unless the man  himself be first holy. But here a work is to be done by which man is  himself made holy, which is done (as we have heard ) alone through  God's Word. For this, then, fixed places, times, persons, and the  entire external order of worship have been created and appointed, so  that it may be publicly in operation.    Since, therefore, so much depends upon God's Word that without it no  holy day can be sanctified, we must know that God insists upon a strict  observance of this commandment, and will punish all who despise His  Word and are not willing to hear and learn it, especially at the time  appointed for the purpose.    Therefore not only those sin against this commandment who grossly  misuse and desecrate the holy day, as those who on account of their  greed or frivolity neglect to hear God's Word or lie in taverns and are  dead drunk like swine; but also that other crowd, who listen to God's  Word as to any other trifle, and only from custom come to preaching,  and go away again, and at the end of the year know as little of it as  at the beginning. For hitherto the opinion prevailed that you had  properly hallowed Sunday when you had heard a mass or the Gospel read;  but no one cared for God's Word, as also no one taught it. Now, while  we have God's Word we nevertheless do not correct the abuse; we suffer  ourselves to be preached to and admonished, but we listen without  seriousness and care.    Know, therefore, that you must be concerned not only about hearing, but  also about learning and retaining it in memory, and do not think that  it is optional with you or of no great importance, but that it is God's  commandment, who will require of you how you have heard, learned, and  honored His Word.    Likewise those fastidious spirits are to be reproved who, when they  have heard a sermon or two, find it tedious and dull, thinking that  they know all that well enough, and need no more instruction. For just  that is the sin which has been hitherto reckoned among mortal sins, and  is called _achedia_, i.e., torpor or satiety, a malignant, dangerous  plague with which the devil bewitches and deceives the hearts of many,  that he may surprise us and secretly withdraw God's Word from us.    For let me tell you this, even though you know it perfectly and be  already master in all things, still you are daily in the dominion of  the devil, who ceases neither day nor night to steal unawares upon you,  to kindle in your heart unbelief and wicked thoughts against the  foregoing and all the commandments. Therefore you must always have  God's Word in your heart, upon your lips, and in your ears. But where  the heart is idle, and the Word does not sound, he breaks in and has  done the damage before we are aware. On the other hand, such is the  efficacy of the Word, whenever it is seriously contemplated heard, and  used, that it is bound never to be without fruit, but always awakens  new understanding, pleasure, and devoutness, and produces a pure heart  and pure thoughts. For these words are not inoperative or dead, but  creative, living words. And even though no other interest or necessity  impel us, yet this ought to urge every one thereunto, because thereby  the devil is put to flight and driven away, and, besides, this  commandment is fulfilled, and [this exercise in the Word] is more  pleasing to God than any work of hypocrisy, however brilliant.    The Fourth Commandment.    Thus far we have learned the first three commandments, which relate to  God. First that with our whole heart we trust in Him, and fear and love  Him throughout all our life. Secondly, that we do not misuse His holy  name in the support of falsehood or any bad work, but employ it to the  praise of God and the profit and salvation of our neighbor and  ourselves. Thirdly, that on holidays and when at rest we diligently  treat and urge God's Word, so that all our actions and our entire life  be ordered according to it. Now follow the other seven, which relate to  our neighbor among which the first and greatest is:    Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.    To this estate of fatherhood and motherhood God has given the special  distinction above all estates that are beneath it that He not simply  commands us to love our parents, but to honor them. For with respect to  brothers, sisters, and our neighbors in general He commands nothing  higher than that we love them, so that He separates and distinguishes  father and mother above all other persons upon earth, and places them  at His side. For it is a far higher thing to honor than to love one,  inasmuch as it comprehends not only love, but also modesty, humility,  and deference as to a majesty there hidden, and requires not only that  they be addressed kindly and with reverence, but, most of all that both  in heart and with the body we so act as to show that we esteem them  very highly, and that, next to God, we regard them as the very highest.  For one whom we are to honor from the heart we must truly regard as  high and great.    We must, therefore impress it upon the young that they should regard  their parents as in God's stead, and remember that however lowly, poor,  frail, and queer they may be, nevertheless they are father and mother  given them by God. They are not to be deprived of their honor because  of their conduct or their failings. Therefore we are not to regard  their persons, how they may be, but the will of God who has thus  created and ordained. In other respects we are, indeed, all alike in  the eyes of God; but among us there must necessarily be such inequality  and ordered difference, and therefore God commands it to be observed,  that you obey me as your father, and that I have the supremacy.    Learn, therefore, first, what is the honor towards parents required by  this commandment to wit, that they be held in distinction and esteem  above all things, as the most precious treasure on earth. Furthermore,  that also in our words we observe modesty toward them, do not accost  them roughly, haughtily, and defiantly, but yield to them and be silent  even though they go too far. Thirdly, that we show them such honor also  by works, that is, with our body and possessions, that we serve them,  help them, and provide for them when they are old, sick, infirm, or  poor, and all that not only gladly, but with humility and reverence, as  doing it before God. For he who knows how to regard them in his heart"]]]
