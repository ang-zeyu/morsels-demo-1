It appears to have shifted its position toward the west,  while the hemispherical cap of sunshine has slipped eastward over the  globe of the planet.    In the next following section of the orbit the planet rotates through  another right angle, but, owing to increased distance from the sun, the  motion in the orbit now becomes slower until, when the planet arrives at  aphelion, _C_, the angular difference disappears and the cross is once  more just under the sun. On returning from aphelion to perihelion the  same phenomena recur in reverse order and the line between day and night  on the planet first shifts westward, attaining its limit in that respect  at _D_, and then, at perihelion, returns to its original position.    Now, if we could stand on the sunward hemisphere of Mercury what, to our  eyes, would be the effect of this shifting of the sun's position with  regard to a fixed point on the planet's surface? Manifestly it would  cause the sun to describe a great arc in the sky, swinging to and fro,  in an east and west line, like a pendulum bob, the angular extent of the  swing being a little more than forty-seven degrees, and the time  required for the sun to pass from its extreme eastern to its extreme  western position and back again being eighty-eight days. But, owing to  the eccentricity of the orbit, the sun swings much faster toward the  east than toward the west, the eastward motion occupying about  thirty-seven days and the westward motion about fifty-one days.    [Illustration: THE REGIONS OF PERPETUAL DAY, PERPETUAL NIGHT, AND  ALTERNATE DAY AND NIGHT ON MERCURY. IN THE LEFT-HAND VIEW THE OBSERVER  LOOKS AT THE PLANET IN THE PLANE OF ITS EQUATOR; IN THE RIGHT-HAND VIEW  HE LOOKS DOWN ON ITS NORTH POLE.]    Another effect of the libratory motion of the sun as seen from Mercury  is represented in the next figure, where we have a view of the planet  showing both the day and the night hemisphere, and where we see that  between the two there is a region upon which the sun rises and sets once  every eighty-eight days. There are, in reality, two of these lune-shaped  regions, one at the east and the other at the west, each between 1,200  and 1,300 miles broad at the equator. At the sunward edge of these  regions, once in eighty-eight days, or once in a Mercurial year, the sun  rises to an elevation of forty-seven degrees, and then descends again  straight to the horizon from which it rose; at the nightward edge, once  in eighty-eight days, the sun peeps above the horizon and quickly sinks  from sight again. The result is that, neglecting the effects of  atmospheric refraction, which would tend to expand the borders of the  domain of sunlight, about one quarter of the entire surface of Mercury  is, with regard to day and night, in a condition resembling that of our  polar regions, where there is but one day and one night in the course of  a year--and on Mercury a year is eighty-eight days. One half of the  remaining three quarters of the planet's surface is bathed in perpetual  sunshine and the other half is a region of eternal night.    And now again, what of life in such a world as that? On the night side,  where no sunshine ever penetrates, the temperature must be extremely  low, hardly greater than the fearful cold of open space, unless  modifying influences beyond our ken exist. It is certain that if life  flourishes there, it must be in such forms as can endure continual  darkness and excessive cold. Some heat would be carried around by  atmospheric circulation from the sunward side, but not enough, it would  seem, to keep water from being perpetually frozen, or the ground from  being baked with unrelaxing frost. It is for the imagination to picture  underground dwellings, artificial sources of heat, and living forms  suited to unearthlike environment.    What would be the mental effects of perpetual night upon a race of  intelligent creatures doomed to that condition? Perhaps not quite so  grievous as we are apt to think. The constellations in all their  splendor would circle before their eyes with the revolution of their  planet about the sun, and with the exception of the sun itself--which  they could see by making a journey to the opposite hemisphere--all the  members of the solar system would pass in succession through their  mid-heaven, and two of them would present themselves with a magnificence  of planetary display unknown on the earth. Venus, when in opposition  under the most favorable circumstances, is scarcely more than 24,000,000  miles from Mercury, and, showing herself at such times with a fully  illuminated disk--as, owing to her position within the orbit of the  earth, she never can do when at her least distance from us--she must be  a phenomenon of unparalleled beauty, at least four times brighter than  we ever see her, and capable, of course, of casting a strong shadow.    The earth, also, is a splendid star in the midnight sky of Mercury, and  the moon may be visible to the naked eye as a little attendant circling  about its brilliant master. The outer planets are slightly less  conspicuous than they are to us, owing to increase of distance.    The revolution of the heavens as seen from the night side of Mercury is  quite different in period from that which we are accustomed to, although  the apparent motion is in the same direction, viz., from east to west.  The same constellations remain above the horizon for weeks at a time,  slowly moving westward, with the planets drifting yet more slowly, but  at different rates, among them; the nearer planets, Venus and the earth,  showing the most decided tendency to loiter behind the stars.    On the side where eternal sunlight shines the sky of Mercury contains no  stars. Forever the pitiless blaze of day; forever,        \"All in a hot and copper sky      The bloody sun at noon.\"    As it is difficult to understand how water can exist on the night  hemisphere, except in the shape of perpetual snow and ice, so it is  hard to imagine that on the day hemisphere water can ever be  precipitated from the vaporous form. In truth, there can be very little  water on Mercury even in the form of vapor, else the spectroscope would  have given unquestionable evidence of its presence. Those who think that  Mercury is entirely waterless and almost, if not quite, airless may be  right. In these respects it would then resemble the moon, and, according  to some observers, it possesses another characteristic lunar feature in  the roughening of its surface by what seem to be innumerable volcanic  craters.    But if we suppose Mercury to possess an atmosphere much rarer than that  of the earth, we may perceive therein a possible provision against the  excessive solar heat to which it is subjected, since, as we see on high  mountains, a light air permits a ready radiation of heat, which does not  become stored up as in a denser atmosphere.    As the sun pours its heat without cessation upon the day hemisphere the  warmed air must rise and flow off on all sides into the night  hemisphere, while cold air rushes in below, to take its place, from the  region of frost and darkness. The intermediate areas, which see the sun  part of the time, as explained above, are perhaps the scene of  contending winds and tempests, where the moisture, if there be any, is  precipitated, through the rapid cooling of the air, in whelming floods  and wild snow-storms driven by hurrying blasts from the realm of endless  night.    Enough seems now to have been said to indicate clearly the hopelessness  of looking for any analogies between Mercury and the earth which would  warrant the conclusion that the former planet is capable of supporting  inhabitants or forms of life resembling those that swarm upon the  latter. If we would still believe that Mercury is a habitable globe we  must depend entirely upon the imagination for pictures of creatures able  to endure its extremes of heat and cold, of light and darkness, of  instability, swift vicissitude, and violent contrast.    In the next chapter we shall study a more peaceful and even-going world,  yet one of great brilliancy, which possesses some remarkable  resemblances to the earth, as well as some surprising divergences from  it.          CHAPTER III    VENUS, THE TWIN OF THE EARTH      We come now to a planet which seems, at the first glance, to afford a  far more promising outlook than Mercury does for the presence of organic  life forms bearing some resemblance to those of the earth. One of the  strongest arguments for regarding Venus as a world much like ours is  based upon its remarkable similarity to the earth in size and mass,  because thus we are assured that the force of gravity is practically the  same upon the two planets, and the force of gravity governs numberless  physical phenomena of essential importance to both animal and vegetable  life. The mean diameter of the earth is 7,918 miles; that of Venus is  7,700 miles. The difference is so slight that if the two planets were  suspended side by side in the sky, at such a distance that their disks  resembled that of the full moon, the eye would notice no inequality  between them.    The mean density of Venus is about nine tenths of that of the earth, and  the force of gravity upon its surface is in the ratio of about 85 to 100  as compared to its force on the surface of the earth. A man removed to  Venus would, consequently, find himself perceptibly lighter than he was  at home, and would be able to exert his strength with considerably  greater effect than on his own planet. But the difference would amount  only to an agreeable variation from accustomed conditions, and would not  be productive of fundamental changes in the order of nature.    Being, like Mercury, nearer to the sun than the earth is, Venus also is  visible to us only in the morning or the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#6)"],[1,"oven.      ~VEAL PATTIES~--Make a sauce of two level tablespoons each of butter and  flour, one cup of stock or boiling water, and one cup of thin cream.  Cook five minutes, add two cups of finely chopped cooked veal, half a  level teaspoon of salt, a saltspoon of pepper, also the beaten yolks of  two eggs, and a tablespoon of finely minced parsley. As soon as the egg  thickens take from the fire and fill hot pastry cases.      ~VIRGINIA STEW~--A half grown chicken or two squirrels, one slice of  salt pork, twelve large tomatoes, three cups of lima beans, one large  onion, two large Irish potatoes, twelve ears of corn, one-fourth pound  of butter, one-fourth pound of lard, one gallon of boiling water, two  tablespoonfuls salt and pepper; mix as any ordinary soup and let it cook  for a couple of hours or more, then serve.      ~BROILING STEAK~--While many prefer steak fairly well done, still the  great majority desire to have it either rare, or certainly not overdone.  For those who wish a steak well done--completely through--and still not  to have the outside crisp to a cinder, it is necessary to cut the steak  possibly as thin as one-half inch, and then the outside can have that  delicious and intense scorching which quickly prevents the escape of  juices, and also gives the slightly burned taste which at its perfect  condition is the most delicious flavor from my own preference that can  be given to a steak. By this I do not mean a steak burned to a cinder,  but slightly scorched over a very hot fire.      ~FOR RARE BROILED STEAK~--For those who are fond of rare steak it can be  cut from one inch to one and one-quarter inches in thickness and the  outside thoroughly and quickly broiled, leaving the inside practically  only partially cooked, so that the blood will follow the knife and still  the steak has been heated completely through and a thin crust on either  side has been well cooked, which has formed the shell to retain the  juices.      ~PROPERLY FRYING STEAK~--To fry steak properly (although some claim it  is not proper to fry steak under any circumstances), it is necessary to  have the butter, oleo, fat or grease piping hot, for two reasons: First,  the steak sears over quickly, and the juices are thus retained within  the steak to better advantage than by the slow process of cooking, but  even more important is the fact that the incrustation thus formed not  only holds the juices within the steak, but prevents the fat from  penetrating and making the steak greasy, soggy and unattractive. As a  rule, however, we must acknowledge that broiled steak is in varying  degrees largely superior to fried steak.      ~BROILED LOIN STEAKS~--Two loin steaks of about a pound each: season  with salt and pepper to taste, baste on either side with a little oil.  Place on a broiler over a bright charcoal fire, and broil for six  minutes, on each side. Serve on a hot dish with Bordeaux sauce and  garnish with rounds of marrow.      ~FRIED HAMBURG STEAK, WITH RUSSIAN SAUCE~--Select a piece of buttock  beef, remove the fat and chop very fine. Add finely chopped shallot, two  eggs, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Mix well and form into balls.  Roll in bread crumbs and fry with a little clarified butter four or five  minutes, turning frequently. Serve with Russian sauce.      ~FRIED SAUSAGE MEAT~--Roll sausage meat into small balls, wrapping each  in a thin rasher of bacon and fasten with a skewer. Fry lightly in a  little butter. Serve with fried parsley and croutons of fried bread.  Serve hot.      ~ROAST BEEF, AMERICAN STYLE~--Lay the meat on sticks in a dripping pan,  so as not to touch the water which is placed in the bottom of the pan.  Season with salt and pepper and roast for three or four hours, basting  frequently. When done sift over the top browned cracker crumbs and  garnish with parsley.      ~ROAST BEEF ON SPIT~--Remove most of the flap from sirloin and trim  neatly. Have a clear brisk fire and place the meat close to it for the  first half hour, then move it farther away, basting frequently, and when  done sprinkle well with salt. The gravy may be prepared by taking the  meat from the dripping pan which will have a brown sediment. Pour in  some boiling water and salt. Strain over the meat. A thickening of flour  may be added if necessary. Garnish with horseradish and serve with  horseradish sauce.      ~ROAST RIBS OF BEEF~--Break off the ends of the bones of the desired  amount of ribs; take out the shin-bone, and place the meat in a baking  pan. Sprinkle with salt and spread some small lumps of butter over it  and dust with flour, baking in a moderate oven till done. Serve hot and  garnish with horseradish.      ~ROAST SHOULDER OF PORK~--Remove the bone from a shoulder of pork and  spread it over inside with a stuffing of sage and onions, filling the  cavity where the bone was taken out. Roll up and secure with a string,  put in a pan and roast in a very hot oven till done. When done put on a  dish, skim off the fat in the pan, add a little water and a tablespoon  of made mustard, boil the gravy once and pass through a strainer over  the meat and serve.      ~SMOKED BEEF WITH CREAM~--Place the finely minced beef in a stewpan with  a lump of butter, cooking it for two minutes, and moisten slightly with  a little cream, add two tablespoonfuls of bechamel sauce. Serve as soon  as it boils up.      ~STEAK~--Cut the steak half an inch thick from between the two ribs,  remove all gristle and fat, and trim in the shape of a flat pear.  Sprinkle both sides with salt, pepper and oil to prevent outside  hardening. Broil ten minutes over a moderate and even fire. Place about  four ounces of maitre d'hotel butter on a dish. Lay the steak upon it  and garnish with fried potatoes, serving either piquant, D'Italian, or  tomato sauce.      ~STEWED SAUSAGE WITH CABBAGE~--Procure a medium sized white cabbage,  remove all the green leaves, and cut it into quarters, removing the  center stalks. Wash thoroughly in cold water, drain well and cut into  small pieces. Put in boiling salted water for five minutes. Take out and  put in cold water and cool moderately. Drain in a colander and put in a  saucepan with one gill of fat from soup stock or one ounce of butter.  Season with a pinch of salt and one-half pinch of pepper, a medium sized  onion and a carrot cut into small quarters. Put on the cover of the  saucepan, set on a moderate fire and cook for half an hour. Take twelve  sausages, prick them with a fork, add them to the cabbage and allow all  to cook together for twelve minutes. Dress the cabbage on a hot dish and  arrange the sausages and carrot on top. Serve very hot.      ~SUCKLING PIG~--The pig should not be more than a month or six weeks  old, and if possible should be dressed the day after it is killed.  First, scald it as follows: Soak the pig in cold water for fifteen  minutes, then plunge it into boiling water. Hold it by the head and  shake around until the hairs begin to loosen. Take out of the water and  rub vigorously with a coarse towel, until all hairs are removed. Cut the  pig open, remove the entrails, wash thoroughly in cold water. Dry on a  towel, cut the feet off at the first joint leaving enough skin to turn  over and keep it wrapped in a wet cloth until ready for use.          SALADS      ~ASPARAGUS SALAD~--Cook the asparagus in salted water, drain and chill.  Serve with French dressing or sprinkle lightly with a little oil  dressing; let stand a half hour and serve with mayonnaise or boiled  dressing as any one of the three distinct kinds is appropriate with this  salad.      ~BEET SALAD~--Bake the beets until tender, remove the skins and place  them in the ice box to chill. Shred a white cabbage finely and sprinkle  well with salt and use lettuce leaves to line the salad bowl. Slice the  beets, place them on the lettuce, spread with a layer of cabbage,  garnish with sliced beets cut in points and dress with mayonnaise or  boiled dressing.      ~BIRDS NEST SALAD~--Have ready as many crisp leaves of lettuce as may be  required to make a dainty little nest for each person. Curl them into  shape and in each one place tiny speckled eggs made by rolling cream  cheese into shape, then sprinkle with fine chopped parsley. Serve with  French dressing hidden under the leaves of the nest.      ~CABBAGE SALAD~--Chop or shave fine, half a medium size head of cabbage  that has been left in cold water until crisp, then drain. Season with  salt and pepper, then pour over it a dressing made this way: Beat the  yolks of two eggs, add two tablespoons of melted butter and beat again.  Add two tablespoons thick sour cream, two tablespoons sugar, a sprinkle  of mustard and half cup of vinegar. Beat until thoroughly mixed, pour  over the cabbage and toss lightly until uniformly seasoned.      ~CAULIFLOWER MAYONNAISE~--Take cold boiled cauliflower, break into  branches, adding salt, pepper and vinegar to season. Heap on a platter,  making the flowers come to a point at the top. Surround with a garnish  of cooked and diced carrots, turnips, green peas. Pour mayonnaise over  all, chill and serve. Another garnish for cauliflower is pickled beets.      ~CELERY AND NUT SALAD~--Cut enough celery fine to measure two cups, add  one cup of finely shredded or shaved cabbage and one and one-half cups  of walnut meats, broken in small pieces, but not chopped. Mix and  moisten on a serving dish and garnish with celery tips.      ~CREOLE SALAD~--Half cup of olive oil, five tablespoons of vinegar, half  teaspoon of powdered sugar, one teaspoon salt, two tablespoons chopped  red pepper, three tablespoons chopped green peppers, half Bermuda onion,  parsley and lettuce and serve.      ~FISH SALAD~--Remove skin and bones and flake cold cooked fish. Sprinkle  with salt and pepper and add a few drops of lemon juice. Arrange on a  bed of shredded lettuce in the shape of a fish. Cover with mayonnaise or  cream dressing and garnish with "]]]
