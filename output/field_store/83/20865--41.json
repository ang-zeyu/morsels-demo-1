Blakely eyed the man homicidally for a moment, and then, smiling one of  those smiles of simulated gayety which the novelists inform us are more  tragic than tears, turned upon him with withering irony.    \"Trust you left the old folks pretty comfortable?\"    \"Dead.\"    \"The old folks dead!\"    \"Quite so.\"    Blakely made a sudden dive for his blanket, tucked it around him with  painful precision, and was heard no more.    Just then the bugle sounded \"lights out,\"--bugle answering bugle in  far-off camps. When our not elaborate night-toilets were complete,  Strong threw somebody else's old boot at the candle with infallible aim,  and darkness took possession of the tent. Ned, who lay on my left,  presently reached over to me, and whispered, \"I say, our friend 'quite  so' is a garrulous old boy! He'll talk himself to death some of these  odd times, if he isn't careful. How he _did_ run on!\"    The next morning, when I opened my eyes, the new member of Mess 6 was  sitting on his knapsack, combing his blond beard with a horn comb. He  nodded pleasantly to me, and to each of the boys as they woke up, one by  one. Blakely did not appear disposed to renew the animated conversation  of the previous night; but while he was gone to make a requisition for  what was in pure sarcasm called coffee, Curtis ventured to ask the man  his name.    \"Bladburn, John,\" was the reply.    \"That's rather an unwieldy name for everyday use,\" put in Strong. \"If it  wouldn't hurt your feelings, I'd like to call you Quite So,--for short.  Don't say no, if you don't like it. Is it agreeable?\"    Bladburn gave a little laugh, all to himself, seemingly, and was about  to say, \"Quite so,\" when he caught at the words, blushed like a girl,  and nodded a sunny assent to Strong. From that day until the end, the  sobriquet clung to him.    The disaster at Bull Run was followed, as the reader knows, by a long  period of masterly inactivity, so far as the Army of the Potomac was  concerned. McDowell, a good soldier but unlucky, retired to Arlington  Heights, and McClellan, who had distinguished himself in Western  Virginia, took command of the forces in front of Washington, and bent  his energies to reorganizing the demoralized troops. It was a dreary  time to the people of the North, who looked fatuously from week to week  for \"the fall of Richmond\"; and it was a dreary time to the denizens of  that vast city of tents and forts which stretched in a semicircle before  the beleaguered Capitol,--so tedious and soul-wearing a time that the  hardships of forced marches and the horrors of battle became desirable  things to them.    Roll-call morning and evening, guard-duty, dress-parades, an occasional  reconnaissance, dominoes, wrestling-matches, and such rude games as  could be carried on in camp made up the sum of our lives. The arrival of  the mail with letters and papers from home was the event of the day. We  noticed that Bladburn neither wrote nor received any letters. When the  rest of the boys were scribbling away for dear life, with drumheads and  knapsacks and cracker-boxes for writing-desks, he would sit serenely  smoking his pipe, but looking out on us through rings of smoke with a  face expressive of the tenderest interest.    \"Look here, Quite So,\" Strong would say, \"the mail-bag closes in half an  hour. Ain't you going to write?\"    \"I believe not to-day,\" Bladburn would reply, as if he had written  yesterday, or would write to-morrow: but he never wrote.    He had become a great favorite with us, and with all the officers of the  regiment. He talked less than any man I ever knew, but there was nothing  sinister or sullen in his reticence. It was sunshine,--warmth and  brightness, but no voice. Unassuming and modest to the verge of  shyness, he impressed every one as a man of singular pluck and nerve.    \"Do you know,\" said Curtis to me one day, \"that that fellow Quite So is  clear grit, and when we come to close quarters with our Palmetto  brethren over yonder, he'll do something devilish?\"    \"What makes you think so?\"    \"Well, nothing quite explainable; the exasperating coolness of the man,  as much as anything. This morning the boys were teasing Muffin Fan\" [a  small mulatto girl who used to bring muffins into camp three times a  week,--at the peril of her life!] \"and Jemmy Blunt of Company K--you  know him--was rather rough on the girl, when Quite So, who had been  reading under a tree, shut one finger in his book, walked over to where  the boys were skylarking, and with the smile of a juvenile angel on his  face lifted Jemmy out of that and set him down gently in front of his  own tent. There Blunt sat speechless, staring at Quite So, who was back  again under the tree, pegging away at his little Latin grammar.\"    That Latin grammar! He always had it about him, reading it or turning  over its dog's-eared pages at odd intervals and in out-of-the-way  places. Half a dozen times a day he would draw it out from the bosom of  his blouse, which had taken the shape of the book just over the left  breast, look at it as if to assure himself it was all right, and then  put the thing back. At night the volume lay beneath his pillow. The  first thing in the morning, before he was well awake, his hand would go  groping instinctively under his knapsack in search of it.    A devastating curiosity seized upon us boys concerning that Latin  grammar, for we had discovered the nature of the book. Strong wanted to  steal it one night, but concluded not to. \"In the first place,\"  reflected Strong, \"I haven't the heart to do it, and in the next place I  haven't the moral courage. Quite So would placidly break every bone in  my body.\" And I believe Strong was not far out of the way.    Sometimes I was vexed with myself for allowing this tall, simple-hearted  country fellow to puzzle me so much. And yet, was he a simple-hearted  country fellow? City bred he certainly was not; but his manner, in spite  of his awkwardness, had an indescribable air of refinement. Now and  then, too, he dropped a word or a phrase that showed his familiarity  with unexpected lines of reading. \"The other day,\" said Curtis, with the  slightest elevation of eyebrow, \"he had the cheek to correct my Latin  for me.\" In short, Quite So was a daily problem to the members of Mess  6. Whenever he was absent, and Blakely and Curtis and Strong and I got  together in the tent, we discussed him, evolving various theories to  explain why he never wrote to anybody and why nobody ever wrote to him.  Had the man committed some terrible crime, and fled to the army to hide  his guilt? Blakely suggested that he must have murdered \"the old folks.\"  What did he mean by eternally conning that tattered Latin grammar? And  was his name Bladburn, anyhow? Even his imperturbable amiability became  suspicious. And then his frightful reticence! If he was the victim of  any deep grief or crushing calamity, why didn't he seem unhappy? What  business had he to be cheerful?    \"It's my opinion,\" said Strong, \"that he's a rival Wandering Jew; the  original Jacobs, you know, was a dark fellow.\"    Blakely inferred from something Bladburn had said, or something he had  not said,--which was more likely,--that he had been a schoolmaster at  some period of his life.    \"Schoolmaster be hanged!\" was Strong's comment. \"Can you fancy a  schoolmaster going about conjugating baby verbs out of a dratted little  spelling-book? No, Quite So has evidently been a--a--Blest if I can  imagine _what_ he's been!\"    Whatever John Bladburn had been, he was a lonely man. Whenever I want a  type of perfect human isolation, I shall think of him, as he was in  those days, moving remote, self-contained, and alone in the midst of two  hundred thousand men.      II    The Indian summer, with its infinite beauty and tenderness, came like a  reproach that year to Virginia. The foliage, touched here and there with  prismatic tints, drooped motionless in the golden haze. The delicate  Virginia creeper was almost minded to put forth its scarlet buds again.  No wonder the lovely phantom--this dusky Southern sister of the pale  Northern June--lingered not long with us, but, filling the once peaceful  glens and valleys with her pathos, stole away rebukefully before the  savage enginery of man.    The preparations that had been going on for months in arsenals and  foundries at the North were nearly completed. For weeks past the air had  been filled with rumors of an advance; but the rumor of to-day refuted  the rumor of yesterday, and the Grand Army did not move. Heintzelman's  corps was constantly folding its tents, like the Arabs, and as silently  stealing away; but somehow it was always in the same place the next  morning. One day, at length, orders came down for our brigade to move.    \"We're going to Richmond, boys!\" shouted Strong, thrusting his head in  at the tent; and we all cheered and waved our caps like mad. You see,  Big Bethel and Bull Run and Ball's Bluff (the Bloody B's, as we used to  call them,) hadn't taught us any better sense.    Rising abruptly from the plateau, to the left of our encampment, was a  tall hill covered with a stunted growth of red-oak, persimmon, and  chestnut. The night before we struck tents I climbed up to the crest to  take a parting look at a spectacle which custom had not been able to rob  of its enchantment. There, at my feet, and extending miles and miles  away, lay the camps of the Grand Army, with its camp-fires reflected  luridly against the sky. Thousands of lights were twinkling in every  direction, some nestling in the valley, some like fire-flies beating  their wings and palpitating among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17162"],[0,"Mother Stories from the Old Testament (#6)"],[1,"clave unto her, saying, \"Whither thou goest, I will go; and  where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and  thy God my God; where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be  buried: the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death part  thee and me.\"    So Ruth refused to leave her mother-in-law, and journeyed with her  until they reached Canaan. Then they both dwelt in the city of  Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, where we shall meet with them again.    [Illustration: RUTH AND NAOMI.]          BOAZ AND RUTH.      When Naomi returned to Bethlehem she was poor. The poor were allowed  at harvest time to follow the reapers; gleaning or gathering up the  stray ears of corn. One day, Ruth obtained permission from her  mother-in-law to go gleaning, and went to glean in the field of a rich  man named Boaz, who happened to be a kinsman, or relative of  Elimelech. But Ruth did not know of this relationship.    Boaz saw Ruth gleaning, and asked one of his servants who she was. The  servant replied, \"It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi  out of the country of Moab.\" Then Boaz spoke kindly to Ruth, telling  her not to go to any other field to glean, but to stay with his  maidens and glean in his field. She fell on her face before him and  bowed herself to the ground, and asked, \"Why have I found grace in  thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a  stranger?\" Boaz was pleased with her because of her kindness to Naomi,  so he replied, \"It hath fully been showed me all that thou hast done  unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband.\" He also bade  her to eat and drink with his servants, and told his reapers to let  some handfuls of grain fall on purpose for her. So Ruth gleaned that  day quite a large quantity of barley, which she took home to Naomi.  Then she learned that Boaz was her kinsman.    She continued gleaning until the end of harvest; and afterwards became  the wife of Boaz and grandmother of Jesse, the father of David. Jesus  Christ descended from David; so we see what high honour was bestowed  upon Ruth for her kindness to her mother-in-law.    [Illustration: BOAZ SHOWING KINDNESS TO RUTH.]          HANNAH PRAYING BEFORE THE LORD.      The Tabernacle, which had been set up by the Israelites in the  wilderness, was after the conquest of Canaan erected at Shiloh, a city  about ten miles south of Shechem. There it remained for more than  three hundred years. No Temple was at Jerusalem in those days, so the  Jewish priests offered sacrifices to God in the Tabernacle at Shiloh.    One day, Hannah, the wife of a priest named Elkanah, came to the  Tabernacle to worship. She was grieved because she had no children;  and especially sad because she had no son. So she knelt down and  prayed to God, and asked God to remember her sorrow and to give her a  son; promising that if God granted her request, she would give that  son to Him all the days of his life.    As Hannah prayed, Eli, the high priest, saw her. She did not speak  aloud, but prayed in her heart; her lips moved, but no voice was  heard; so Eli thought that a drunken woman had come before the Lord.  He reproved her saying, \"How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy  wine from thee.\" But Hannah had not drunk wine. She answered Eli, \"No,  my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine  nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.\" Then  Eli bade her \"Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy  petition that thou hast asked of Him.\"    Hannah left the Tabernacle. Her face was no longer sad. She believed  God had heard her prayer; and He had done so. In due time a son was  given her, whom she named Samuel. Samuel means _Heard of God_, which  name Hannah gave him in remembrance of God's goodness in hearing her  prayer.    [Illustration: HANNAH PRAYING BEFORE THE LORD.]          ELI AND SAMUEL.      Elkanah went up to Shiloh yearly to offer sacrifice: and when Samuel  was old enough, Hannah went with her husband and took her little boy  with her. They came to Eli the high priest, and Hannah said: \"Oh, my  Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here praying. For this child I  prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition. Therefore also have I  given him to the Lord.\" Then she left Samuel with Eli.    Samuel assisted Eli in the Tabernacle service, and wore a linen ephod  like a priest. His mother came yearly to see him, when she accompanied  Elkanah to the sacrifice at Shiloh, and each time brought with her a  little coat, which she had made for her son. Eli was an old man, who  had two wicked sons. These he had not restrained as he should have  done. So God was displeased with him and them on account of their  sins.    One night, while the lamp in the Tabernacle was burning, and Eli was  resting, Samuel was sleeping. A voice came to him calling, \"Samuel!\"  He rose, and ran to Eli saying, \"Here am I.\" But Eli had not called,  so Samuel lay down again. A second time the same voice called,  \"Samuel!\" He went to Eli and said, \"Here am I; for thou didst call  me.\" But Eli replied, \"I called not, my son; lie down again.\" The call  was repeated a third time; then Eli told Samuel it was the Lord who  called him; and bade him answer if the voice came again, \"Speak, Lord,  for thy servant heareth.\" Again God called, and Samuel answered as Eli  had commanded him. Then God told Samuel what terrible things should  befall Eli and his sons through their wickedness.    [Illustration: SAMUEL COMING TO ELI.]          DEATH OF ELI AND HIS SONS.      In the morning Samuel feared to tell Eli what the Lord had shown him;  but Eli bade him do so, saying to Samuel, \"God do so to thee, and more  also, if thou hide any thing from me of all that He said unto thee.\"  So Samuel told Eli all God had said, keeping nothing back, and Eli  answered, \"It is the Lord: let Him do what seemeth Him good.\"    Afterwards there was war between the Israelites and the Philistines,  and both sides prepared for battle. They fought; the Israelites were  defeated, and many of them slain. Then they sent to Shiloh and fetched  the ark of the covenant out of the Tabernacle, carrying it to the  camp, and thinking that if the ark were with them they would overcome  their enemies. But the ark only signified God's presence in their  midst; it was not God Himself, to give them victory. It was very  sinful of them thus to use what God had made so holy; and God suffered  them again to be defeated. The ark was taken by the Philistines, and  many of the Israelites were slain.    Eli, who was then ninety-eight years old, and nearly blind, sat by the  wayside, trembling for the safety of the ark, and waiting for  messengers to bring news of the battle. Presently a messenger came who  told him the Israelites had fled before the Philistines, that his two  sons Hophni and Phinehas were slain, and that the ark of God had been  taken. When he heard that the ark had been taken, he fell backward  from off his seat and died. Thus God's judgment upon Eli and his sons  came to pass. In our picture we see the messenger, who has just come  from the field of battle, telling Eli the sad tidings that caused his  death.    [Illustration: ELI RECEIVING THE EVIL TIDINGS.]          PLAYING ON THE HARP BEFORE SAUL.      We are not told much in the Bible concerning the early life of David.  He was born in Bethlehem. We have seen who his father was, but I do  not find that his mother's name is given. His own name means  \"beloved.\" What a happy name! He must have been much loved by his  parents, and we know he was loved by God.    Like many other youths in Canaan, he acted as a shepherd to his  father's flocks. He was a fair, open-faced boy; \"ruddy, and of a  beautiful countenance, and goodly to look at,\" so the Scriptures say.  He was a good musician, knew how to sling stones at a mark, and was so  brave that when a lion and a bear came to attack the lambs of his  flock he went after them and killed them both. One day a strange and  most important event happened. Samuel, the prophet, came from Ramah,  and pouring some very precious oil upon the head of David, anointed  him to be the future King of Israel. Saul was then King, but on  account of his wickedness God had rejected him, saying that another  should reign in his stead.    Soon after this event Saul became very wretched. An evil spirit  troubled him, we are told. His servants advised him to get a man that  could play skilfully upon the harp, so that music might drive away his  misery. Some one suggested David; and David was sent for. He brought  sweet strains from his harp, and Saul was soothed. Saul was pleased  with David. We are told that \"he loved him greatly,\" and that David  became his armour-bearer. But he soon grew jealous, and twice threw a  javelin at David, seeking to smite him to the wall and kill him. This,  however, he was not able to do.    [Illustration: DAVID PLAYING ON THE HARP BEFORE SAUL.]          DAVID AND GOLIATH.      How attentively David looks at the stones in his hand. His sling is on  his arm, and his bag by his side. What is he about to do with those  stones? And who is that tall man in armour, strutting about with such  a long spear in his hand?    Two armies were drawn up in battle array. They were the armies of the  Israelites and Philistines. The camp of the Israelites was on one  hill, and that of the Philistines was upon another; a valley lying  between. For forty days these armies had been facing each other, but  yet the battle had been delayed. The Philistines had on their side a  giant of great height and strength, encased in armour, who daily came  out, challenging the Israelites to send a man from their camp to fight  with him. But no man among them dared to go against Goliath, the  Philistines' champion.    Meanwhile Jesse had sent David to the Israelites' camp to see after  his brethren. He heard what the giant"]]]
