The Pope had  scarcely gone before the irritated artist, wishing to make an example as  a warning for all future critics, placed this Messer Biaggio in his  hell, well and duly, under the scarcely flattering guise of Minos. That  was always Dante's way when he wanted to avenge himself upon an enemy.    I leave you to imagine the lamentations and complaints of the poor  master of ceremonies when he saw himself damned in this manner. He threw  himself at the Pope's feet, declaring that he would never arise unless  His Holiness would have him taken out of hell: that was the most  important thing. As for the punishment, that the painter deserved for  this dreadful sacrilege, Messer Biaggio would leave that entirely to the  high impartiality of the Holy Father.    \"Messer Biaggio,\" replied Paul III. with as much seriousness as he could  maintain, \"you know that I have received from God an absolute power in  heaven and upon the earth, but I can do nothing in hell; therefore you  must remain there.\"    While Michael Angelo was working at his picture of _The Last Judgment_,  he fell from the scaffold and seriously injured his leg. Soured by pain  and seized with an attack of misanthropy, the painter shut himself up in  his house and would not see any one.    But he reckoned without his physician; and the physician this time was  as stubborn as the invalid.    This excellent disciple of AEsculapius was named Baccio Rontini. Having  learned by chance of the accident that had befallen the great artist, he  presented himself before his house and knocked in vain at the door.    No response.    He shouted, he flew into a passion, and he called the neighbours and the  servants in a loud voice.    Complete silence.    He goes to find a ladder, places it against the front of the house, and  tries to enter by the casements. The windows are hermetically sealed and  the shutters are fast.    What is to be done? Any one else in the physician's place would have  given up; but Rontini was not the man to be discouraged for so little.  With much difficulty he enters the cellar and with no less trouble he  goes up into Buonarroti's room, and, partly by acquiescence and partly  by force, he triumphantly tends his friend's leg.    It was quite time: exasperated by his sufferings, the artist had  resolved to let himself die.        _Trois Maitres_ (Paris, 1861).    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Dante, _Inferno_ III.          MAGDALEN IN THE DESERT    (_CORREGGIO_)    AIME GIRON      Correggio was a painter and a poet at the same time, interpreting  Nature, flattering her, idealizing her, and realizing her creations in  their double aesthetic expression, with undulating outlines and tender  tones. His drawing was modelled and supple, with a certain vigour of  line and a certain solidity of relief. He had a charming imagination of  conception and a voluptuous grace in its accomplishment, which are  requisites in the painting of women and children. He therefore excelled  in rendering _bambini_. With a note-book in his hand, he studied them  everywhere. This explains why his Loves and his Cherubs have such rare  truth of mien, of flesh, and of life. His knowledge of anatomy is great  and he foreshortens on canvas and ceiling astonishingly before the  advent of Michael Angelo. His enchanting colouring, impasted like that  of Giorgione, vivid as that of Titian, ran through the most delicate  gradations and melted into the most elusive harmonies. Beneath his  facile brush, soft and thick, the transparencies of the skin and the  morbidezza of the flesh become ideal.    He was the first to apply himself to the choice of fabrics, and one of  the first in Italy to attend to the scientific distribution of light.  But, in the famous _chiaroscuro_ he does not get his effects by  contrasts, but by analogies, superimposing shadow upon shadow and light  upon light, both being disposed in large masses and graduated in  progression. This process occurs at its fullest in the _Christmas  Night_, where the moon shines, and the child glows with radiance, in a  kind of symbolic struggle between the natural light of this world and  the supernatural light of the other. The effect is such that the  spectator is forced instinctively to blink his eyes, as does the  Shepherdess herself entering the stable.    \"When Correggio excels he is a painter worthy of Athens,\" wrote Diderot,  whose art criticism had in it more of sentiment than knowledge.    \"With Correggio everything is large and graceful,\" said Louis Carrache,  who gave Correggio a large place in his eclecticism. But after studying  and weighing everything, from his somewhat excessive qualities it  follows that Correggio was more of an idealist than a mystic and obeyed  Art more than Faith, with a leaning towards the apotheosis of form. He  painted _Io and Jupiter_ for Frederick Gonzaga of Mantua. This picture  having passed to the son of the Regent, the two passionate heads so  strongly troubled his prudery that he cut them out and burned them.  Coypel then begged the Prince to spare the rest and to give it to him.  He obtained it on condition that \"he would make good use of it,\" and on  the death of Coypel, M. Pasquier, _depute du Commerce de Rouen_, paid  16,500 _livres_ for the mutilated remains, as I find in a very old  account.    [Illustration: MAGDALEN.          _Correggio_]    All the great museums of the world possess Correggios, and I will only  mention the exquisite _Saint Catherine_ and the resplendent _Antiope_ of  the Louvre; the _Danae_ of the Borghese Gallery, a _chef-d'oeuvre_ of  grace and delicacy; and, finally, in the Dresden Gallery, our _Magdalen  in the Desert_, that jewel so well-known and so often reproduced.    This Magdalen as a matter of fact holds the first place among the small  Correggios. There are two kinds of Magdalens in art: I. the Repentant,  emaciated, growing ugly, disfigured by tears and penitence at the end of  her life, with a skull in her hand or before her eyes, not having had  even--like the one sculptured in the Cathedral of Rouen--\"for three  times ten winters any other vesture than her long hair,\" according to  Petrarch's verse; II. the Sinner, always young, always beautiful, always  seductive, who has not lost any of her charms nor even of her coquetry,  and with whom the Book of Life takes the place of the Death's Head.    Our Magdalen belongs to the latter class. In a solitary spot, but  attractive with its verdure and rocks, on a grassy knoll the saint is  stretched out at full length, with her shoulder, her bosom, her arms,  and her feet adorably bare. A blue fabric drapes the rest of her body  and forms a coquettish hood for her head and neck. Her flesh has a  robust elegance of line. Leaning on her right elbow, her hand, half  hidden in her hair, supports a charming and meditative head, while her  other arm is slipped under an open manuscript. Her hair, long and  blonde, according to legend--which she loves and still cares for because  it once wiped the feet of her Saviour--falls in thick curls, or strays  at will with a premeditated abandon. On the ground, to her right, stands  the vase of perfumes of her first adoration; to the left are the stones  of her supreme expiation.    What grace in her attitude! What beauty of form! She is thrown in with a  rare happiness and painted with an exquisite delicacy of touch and tint.  The blue drapery upon the green landscape defines her sufficiently  without making her stand out too much, leaving the figure and the  landscape to mingle without disturbing each other in skilful harmony.  All of this is in most finished execution, a little elaborate, perhaps,  and the expression of the face reflects the sweet, sad memory of the  Beloved, whose Gospels she is reading, just as one reads again tender  letters of the past.    This work was executed for the Dukes of Este, who kept it in a silver  frame studded with precious stones and used it as an ornament for their  bedrooms, and when they travelled, they took it with them in a casket.  When the King of Poland became its possessor, he gave it a second boxing  of glass with lock and key. In 1788, this masterpiece having been  stolen, 1,000 ducats were promised for its discovery, and, in  consideration of that sum, the thief denounced himself. Cristofano  Allori, the greatest Florentine painter of the Decadence, made a superb  copy for the Offices, I believe.    This Magdalen of Correggio's, \"the least converted of sinners and the  most adorable of penitents,\" is she really, historically and  liturgically the Magdalen of the House of Bethany, of the grotto de la  Sainte-Baume in Provence? No. She recalls rather \"_cette dame de  marque_\" who was evoked in the Seventeenth Century by the Carmelite  Father Pierre de Saint-Louis in his sublime poem of accomplished  burlesque; and does not the following verse hum in your ear:      _\"Levres dont l'incarnat faisant voir a la fois    Un rosier sans epine, un chapelet sans croix,\"_    while the sinner                _\" ... s'occupe a punir le forfait    De son temps preterit qui ne fut qu'imparfait\"?_    This evidently is not at all the art of the Middle Ages, nor its saints,  whose vestment was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17487"],[0,"Casa Grande Ruin (#6)"],[1,"the western wall, and the northern wall has a setback of 9  inches, and the top of the wall still shows the position of nearly all  the roof timbers. This suggests--and the suggestion is supported by  other facts to be mentioned later--that the northern room was added  after the completion of the rest of the edifice.    The second roof or third floor level, the present top of the wall, has a  decided pitch outward, amounting to nearly 5 inches. Furthermore, the  outside of the northern wall of the middle room, above the second roof  level of the northern room, is very much eroded. This indicates that the  northern room never had a greater height than two stories, but probably  the walls were crowned with low parapets. In this connection it may be  stated that a calculation of the amount of debris within the building  and for a distance of 10 feet about it in every direction, the interior  floor level being determined by excavation, showed an amount of material  which, added to the walls, would raise them less than 3 feet; in other  words, the present height of the walls is very nearly the maximum  height.    Subsequent to this examination the ruin was cleared out by contractors  for the Government in carrying out a plan for the repair and  preservation of the ruin, and it was reported that in one of the rooms a  floor level below that previously determined was found, making an  underground story or cellar. This would but slightly modify the  foregoing conclusion, as the additional debris would raise the walls  less than a foot, and in the calculation no account was taken of  material removed from the surface of the walls.    In support of the hypothesis that the second roof level of the northern  room was the top roof, it may be stated that there is no trace of an  opening in the walls above that level, except on the western side. There  was a narrow opening in the western corner, but so well filled that it  is hardly perceptible. Doubtless it formed a niche or opening in the  parapet.    The southern wall on the first roof level still preserves very clear and  distinct impressions of the rushes which were used in the construction  of the roof. In some cases these impressions occur 3 inches above the  top of the floor beams, in others directly above them, showing that the  secondary series of poles was very irregularly placed. In the eastern  and western walls the impressions of rushes are also clear, but there  they are parallel with the wall surface. The rushes were about the  thickness of a pencil.    The floor joists were 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and as a rule projected  into the wall but 5 to 8 inches. In some places in the northern wall,  however, they extended into the masonry as much as 3 feet 3 inches. The  beams were doubtless cut by guess, at the place where trees of the  requisite size were found, according to the method employed by the  Pueblo Indians today, and if, as supposed, the northern room was built  after the rest of the structure, the excess in length would necessarily  be found in the northern wall.    In the roof construction previously described rushes or canes formed the  third member, and in the northern room the wall is rough immediately  above the impressions of rushes, and projects 8 to 12 inches. This  feature is well marked; it may be a remnant of the clay covering of  floor or roof, but it is almost too thick for that and possibly marks  the position of a low bench, as previously suggested. The bottoms of the  openings come just to or a trifle above the top of this marking.    [Illustration: Pl. LVII: Blocked Opening in West Wall.]    The walls of the western room were smoothly finished and the finish is  well preserved, but here, as in the northern room, the exterior wall of  the middle room was not finished above the second roof level, and there  is no doubt that two stories above the ground were the maximum height of  the western rooms, excluding the parapet. The eastern wall presents a  marked double convexity while the western wall is comparatively straight  in a horizontal line, but markedly concave vertically above the first  roof level. Below this level it is straight. The floor beams were from 3  to 6 inches in diameter. The marks in the eastern wall show that the  beams projected into it to a nearly uniform depth of 1 foot 4 inches. In  the western wall, however, the depth varies from 1 to 3 feet. The beams  which entered the eastern wall were very irregularly placed, the line  rising in the center some 3 or 4 inches. The beams of the second roof  level show the same irregularity and in the same place; possibly this  was done to correct a level, for the same feature is repeated in the  eastern room.    The walls of the southern room are perhaps better finished and less well  constructed than any others in the building. The beam holes in the  southern wall are regular, those in the northern wall less so. The beams  used averaged a little smaller than those in the other rooms, and there  is no trace whatever in the overhanging wall of the use of rushes or  canes in the construction of the roof above. The walls depart  considerably from vertical plane surfaces; the southern wall inclines  fully 12 inches inward, while in the northeastern corner the side of a  doorway projects fully 3 inches into the room. The broken condition of  the southern wall indicates carelessness in construction. The weakest  point in pise construction is of course the framing around openings. In  the southern wall the openings, being doubtless the first to give way,  are now almost completely obliterated. In the center of the wall there  were two openings, one above the other, but not a trace of lintels now  remains, and the eastern half of the wall now stands clear from other  walls. Probably there was also an opening near the southwestern corner  of the room, but the lintels giving way the wall above fell down and, as  shown on the ground plan (plate LII), filled up the opening. This could  happen only with exceptionally light lintels and exceptionally bad  construction of walls; one of the large blocks, before described as  composing the wall, must have rested directly above the opening, which  was practically the same size as the block.    The walls of the eastern room were well finished, and, except the  western wall, in fairly good preservation. The floor beams were not  placed in a straight line, but rise slightly near the middle, as noted  above. The finish of some of the openings suggests that the floor was  but 3 or 4 inches above the beams, and that the roughened surface,  already mentioned, was not part of it. The northern wall of this room  seems to have run through to the outside, on the east, as though at one  time it formed the exterior wall of the structure; and the eastern wall  of the building north of this room is separated from the rest of the  wall by a wide crack, as though it had been built against a smooth  surface. The western wall of this room shows clearly that in the  construction of the building the floor beams were laid on the tops of  the walls, and that the intervening spaces were filled with small lumps  of material up to a level with or a little above the upper surface of  the beams, the regular construction with large blocks being then  resumed.    In the middle room many blocks bearing the imprint of grass and rushes  were found, and the rough marking of the walls just above the floor  beams is covered in places in this room with masonry composed of these  grass marked blocks projecting some distance into the room, indicating  that in this room at least they mark the position of a bench. These  blocks occupy the whole thickness of the setback at the second roof  level--perhaps an indication that the upper story was added after the  building was occupied.      _Openings._    The Casa Grande was well provided with doorways and other openings  arranged in pairs one above the other. There were doorways from each  room into each adjoining room, except that the middle room was entered  only from the east. Some of the openings were not used and were closed  with blocks of solid masonry built into them long prior to the final  abandonment of the ruin.    The middle room had three doorways, one above the other, all opening  eastward. The lowest doorway opened directly on the floor level, and was  2 feet wide, with vertical sides. Its height could not be determined, as  the top was completely broken away and merged with the opening above,  but the bottom, which is also the floor level, is 6 feet 9 inches below  the level of the first roof beams. The doorway of the second story is  preserved only on the northern side. Its bottom, still easily  distinguishable, is 1 foot 6 inches above the bottom of the floor beams.  It was not over 2 feet wide and was about 4 feet high. The upper doorway  is still well preserved, except that the lintels are gone. It is about  three inches narrower at the top than at the bottom and about 4 feet  high.    In addition to its three doorways, all in the eastern wall, the middle  tier of rooms was well provided with niches and holes in the walls, some  of them doubtless utilized as outlooks. On the left of the upper doorway  are two holes, a foot apart, about 4 inches in diameter, and smoothly  finished. Almost directly above these some 3 feet, and about 2 feet  higher than the top of the door, there are two similar holes. Near the  southern end of the room in the same wall there is another round opening  a trifle larger and about 41/2 feet above the floor level. In the western  wall there are two similar openings, and there is one each in the  northern and southern walls. All these openings are circular, of small  diameter, and are in the upper or third story, as shown on the  elevations herewith, figure 330.
