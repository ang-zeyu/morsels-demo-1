In this martial  country the Bodhisattva assumed yet another character as Shogun Jizo,  a militant priest riding on horseback[72] and wearing a helmet who  became the patron saint of warriors and was even identified with the  Japanese war god, Hachiman. Until the seventeenth century Jizo was  worshipped principally by soldiers and priests, but subsequently his  cult spread among all classes and in all districts. His benevolent  activities as a guide and saviour were more and more emphasized: he  heals sickness, he lengthens life, he leads to heaven, he saves from  hell: he even suffers as a substitute in hell and is the special  protector of the souls of children amid the perils of the underworld.  Though this modern figure of Jizo is wrought with ancient materials,  it is in the main a work of Japanese sentiment.

Tara is an Indian and Lamaist  goddess _associated_ with Avalokita and in origin analogous to the  Saktis of Tantrism. Kuan-yin is a female form of Avalokita who can  assume all shapes. The original Kuan-yin was a male deity: male  Kuan-yins are not unknown in China and are said to be the rule in  Korea. But Tara and Kuan-yin may justly be described as the same in so  far as they are attempts to embody the idea of divine pity in a  Madonna.]    [Footnote 36: But many scholars think that the formula Om manipadme  hum, which is supposed to be addressed to Avalokita, is really an  invocation to a form of Sakti called Manipadma. A Nepalese  inscription says that \"The Saktas call him Sakti\" (_E.R.E._ vol. II.  p. 260 and _J.A._ IX. 192), but this may be merely a way of saying  that he is identical with the great gods of all sects.]    [Footnote 37: Harlez, _Livre des esprits et des immortels_, p. 195,  and Dore, _Recherches sur les superstitions en Chine_, pp. 94-138.]    [Footnote 38: See Fenollosa, _Epochs of Chinese and Japanese Art_ I.  pp. 105 and 124; Johnston, _Buddhist China_, 275 ff.

NUTS AND BERRIES.    Pine nuts were another important article of food, and were much  prized by the Indians. They are very palatable and nutritious,  and are also greatly relished by white people whenever they can  be obtained. The seeds of the Digger or nut pine (_Pinus  Sabiniana_) were the ones most used on the western side of the  Sierras, although the seeds of the sugar pine (_P. Lambertiana_)  were also sometimes eaten. On account of their soft shell, nuts  from the pinon pine (_P. monophylla_), which grows principally on  the eastern side of the mountains, were considered superior to  either of the other kinds, and were an important article of  barter with the tribes of that region. All of these trees are  very prolific, and their crop of nuts in fruitful years has been  estimated to be even greater than the enormous wheat crop of  California, although of course but a very small portion of it is  ever gathered. Many other kinds of nuts and seeds were also  eaten.    The principal berries used by the Indians of Yosemite and tribes  lower down in the foothills were those of the manzanita  (_Arctostaphylos glauca_). They are about the size of  huckleberries, of a light brown color, and when ripe have the  flavor of dried apples. They are used for eating, and also to  make a kind of cider for drinking, and for mixing with some food  preparations. Manzanita is the Spanish for \"little apple,\" and  this shrub, with its rich red bark and pale green foliage, is  perhaps the most beautiful and most widely distributed in  California. Strawberries, black raspberries, elderberries, wild  cherries and the fruit of the Sierra plum (_Prunus subcordata_)  are also used by the Indians, but wild edible berries are not as  plentiful in California as they are in the Atlantic States.      GRASSHOPPERS AND WORMS.    In addition to the staple articles of food already mentioned,  many other things were eaten when they could be obtained. These  included grasshoppers, certain kinds of large tree worms, the  white fungi which grows upon the oak, mushrooms, and the larvae  and pupae of ants and other insects. The pupae of a certain kind  of fly which breeds extensively on the shores of Mono Lake, about  forty miles from Yosemite, was an important article of commerce  across the mountains, and was made into a kind of paste called  _ka-cha'-vee_, which is still much relished by the Indians, and  is a prominent dish at their feasts.    The manner of catching grasshoppers was to dig a large hole,  somewhat in the shape of a fly trap, with the bottom larger  than the opening at the top, so that the insects could not  readily get out of it. This hole was dug in the center of a  meadow, which was then surrounded by Indians armed with small  boughs, who beat the grasshoppers towards a common center and  drove them into the trap. A fire was then kindled on top of them,  and after they had been well roasted they were gathered up and  stored for future use.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  A WOOD GATHERER.  As in all Indian tribes, the women do most of the work.]    Other articles of food were various kinds of roots, grasses and  herbage, some of which were cooked, while others were eaten in  their natural condition. The lupine (_Lupinus bicolor_ and other  species), whose brilliant flowers are such a beautiful feature of  all the mountain meadows in the spring and summer, was a favorite  plant for making what white people would call \"greens,\" and when  eaten was frequently moistened with some of the manzanita cider  already referred to. Among the roots used for food were those of  the wild caraway (_Carum_), wild hyacinth (_Brodioea_), sorrel  (_Oxalis_), and camass (_Camassia esculenta_).          Chapter Five    RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND BELIEFS.      The Indians of this region, in common with most, if not all, of  the North American aborigines, were of a highly religious  temperament, most devout in their beliefs and observances, and  easily wrought upon by the priests or medicine men of their  tribes. Elaborate ceremonies were carried out, in which all of  the details were highly symbolical, and some of their curious and  picturesque superstitions were responsible for acts of cruelty  and vengeance, which in many cases were foreign to their natural  disposition.      DANCES.    Dancing was an important part of all religious observances, and  was practiced purely as a ceremonial, and never for pleasure or  recreation. Both men and women took part, the men executing a  peculiar shuffling step which involved a great deal of stamping  upon the ground with their bare feet, and the women performing a  curious sideways, swaying motion. Some of the dancers carried  wands or arrows, and indulged in wild gesticulations. They  usually circled slowly around a fire, and danced to the point of  exhaustion, when others would immediately take their places. The  ceremony was accompanied by the beating of rude drums, and by a  monotonous chant, which was joined in by all the dancers.    The great occasions for dancing were before going to war, and  when cremating the bodies of their dead. The war dance was  probably the most elaborate in costume and other details, and of  recent years the Indians have sometimes given public exhibitions  of what purported to be war dances, but these performances, like  everything else which they do from purely mercenary motives, are  very poor imitations of the originals, and it is doubtful if they  have ever allowed a genuine war dance to be witnessed by white  men.      FESTIVALS.    The various tribes in the vicinity of Yosemite Valley are  accustomed to hold a great meeting or festival once a year, each  tribe taking its turn as hosts, and the others sometimes coming  from considerable distances. At these meetings there are dances  and other ceremonials, and also a grand feast, for which  extensive preparations are made. Another feature of the occasion  is the presentation of gifts to the visiting tribes, consisting  of money, blankets, clothing, baskets, bead-work, or other  valuable articles. These presents, or their equivalent, no matter  how small they may be, are always returned to the givers at the  next annual festival, together with additional gifts, which, in  turn, must be given back the following year, and so on.    At these gatherings an Indian is appointed to secure and keep on  hand a good supply of wood for the camp fires, and every day he  spreads a blanket on the ground and sits on it, and the other  Indians throw money, clothing, or other contributions, into the  blanket, to pay him and his assistants for their services. At  other times this man acts as a messenger or news carrier--first  spreading his blanket to collect his fees, and then starting off  on his mission.      MARRIAGE.    Many of the Indians in Mariposa and adjoining counties were  polygamists, having two or three, and sometimes more, wives. Some  of the chiefs and head men would have wives from several of the  adjacent tribes, which had a tendency to establish permanent  friendly relations among them.    Every man who took a young woman for his wife had to buy her.  Young women were considered by their parents as personal  chattels, subject to sale to the highest suitable bidder, and the  payment of the price constituted the main part of the marriage  ceremony. The wife was then the personal property of the husband,  which he might sell or gamble away if he wished; but such  instances were said to be very rare. In case negotiations for a  marriage fell through, the preliminary payments were scrupulously  returned to the rejected suitor by the parents.    Even a widow, independent of control in the matter of marriage,  if she consented to become a man's wife, received some  compensation herself from her intended husband.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Dore_.  A YOUNG YOSEMITE.  The babies are tied to their baskets to make them straight, and  keep them out of mischief.]    It is said that in their marital relations they were as a rule  strictly faithful to each other. If the woman was found to be  guilty of unfaithfulness to her husband, the penalty was death.  Such a thing as a man whipping or beating his wife was never  known. Whipping under any circumstances was considered a more  humiliating and disgraceful punishment than death.    Even in the management of children, whipping was never resorted  to as punishment for disobedience. In fact, children were always  treated in such a kind, patient, loving manner, that disobedience  was a fault rarely known. The pre-natal maternal influence, and  subsequent treatment after birth, were such that they were  naturally patient and readily submissive to kind parental  control.    In recent years, under the influence and examples often seen in  what is called civilized life, Indian husbands have been known to  beat their wives, and mothers to whip their children.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Boysen_.  LENA AND VIRGIL.  The canopy of the baby basket is called Cho-ko'-ni and the  Royal Arches, from their resemblance to it, have also received  this name from the Indians.]      MEDICINE MEN.    At the time of the settlement of California by the whites, every  Indian tribe had its professional doctors or medicine men, who  also acted as religious leaders. They were the confidential  counselors of the chiefs and head-men of the tribes, and had  great influence and control over the people. They claimed to be  spiritual mediums, and to have communication with the departed  spirits of some of their old and most revered chieftains and dear  friends, now in a much more happy condition than when here in  earthly life. They were thought to be endowed with supernatural  powers, not only in curing all diseases (except"]]]
