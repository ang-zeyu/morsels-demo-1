[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#6)"],[1,"head surrounded by dots is shown in connection with the main part of the  glyph. In Dresden 44b (Pl. 3, fig. 13) there is a glyph which seems to  show the same centipede head although it has no connection with god D in  the place where it is found. In Dresden 27 (Pl. 3, fig. 14), moreover,  still another variant of the glyph for god D seems to occur. This shows  a prefix clearly representing the centipede and the \"moon sign\" is the  main part of the glyph. Directly beside this in the codex is found the  _Ahau_-like sign for god D and god D himself is represented in the  middle section of the page.    The association of god D with the centipede may be explained by the fact  that as this god is regarded as the Moon or Night god, so the centipede  is an animal which frequents dark places. Another point in this  connection may be made if we consider the head of the centipede in the  head-dress and in the glyphs as representing the day sign _Akbal_ (Pl.  3, fig. 10) as _Akbal_ in Maya means night. It must be admitted,  however, that the head might represent the day sign _Chuen_ almost as  well as _Akbal_. The centipede is connected with death and destruction  in the same way as the owl. Both are shown in Vaticanus 3773, 13,  associated with the \"house of drought.\"      CRUSTACEA    With one possible exception no crustaceans were found depicted in the  Maya codices, but we have introduced figures of two from the Nuttall  Codex. The first of these (Pl. 4, fig. 5) is probably a crayfish,  perhaps _Cambarus montezumae_. It seems unlikely that the so-called  Spanish lobster (_Palinurus_) can be intended or the powerful spined  antennae would have been shown. It is interesting to note that the  stalked eyes are clearly pictured. The second example seems to be a crab  (Pl. 4, fig. 6). Two large chelae of nearly equal size are simply drawn  and four rounded projections at the top of the figure appear to  represent the walking legs. Its rotund form and subequal chelae suggest  the land crab, _Geocarcinus_, but exact determination is of course  impossible. What is certainly a large crab, perhaps of the same species,  is shown in Tro-Cortesianus 88c (Pl. 36, fig. 1) in connection with a  dog whose feet it seems about to pinch with its two large chelae. The  shell is ornamented in a conventionalized way as if with scales.      ARACHNIDA    In Codex Borbonicus 9 (Pl. 4, fig. 4) there is represented a  stout-bodied form of spider with two sharply pointed chelicerae  projecting from the conventionalized mouth. These characteristics  together with the absence of any web, suggest a large predacious  species, probably the tarantula (_Tarantula_ sp.) which is common in  Mexico. The acute powers of observation shown by the artist are evinced  in this figure since he draws the spider correctly with eight legs  instead of the six or ten sometimes seen in drawings by our own  illustrators.      ARACHNOIDEA    The scorpion (Maya, _sinaan_) figures prominently in the  Tro-Cortesianus, two drawings from which are shown (Pl. 4, figs. 1, 2).  As here conventionalized, the jointed appendages are represented as  composed of an indefinite number of round segments. The large chelate  pedipalps are also prominently figured but the smaller walking legs are  commonly omitted. In Pl. 4, fig. 1, however, there is a pair of  posterior chelate appendages which are probably added to give a more  anthropoid cast to the figure. The slight projections along the sides of  the body in Pl. 4, fig. 2, probably do not represent the legs. In  another drawing (Tro-Cortesianus 44b) these are also present but further  reduced so as not to exceed the heavy fringe of spines surrounding the  body. In Pl. 4, fig. 1, the fringe alone appears. The formidable nature  of the scorpion is of course due to the poisonous sting at the tip of  the attenuated abdomen or \"tail.\" In the Maya pictures this portion is  usually shown as a grasping organ. Thus in fig. 1 it is similar to the  chela and holds a cord by which a deer has been caught. In fig. 2 the  \"tail\" is terminated by a hand. The same thing is seen in  Tro-Cortesianus 44b where the hand seizes a cord by which a deer is  snared. The scorpion is represented in the drawings with a  conventionalized face that is very characteristic. The facial disc is  divided into three parts by a median area of straight or irregular  lateral boundaries ending anteriorly in two in-turned scrolls suggesting  the alae of the nose. A circular eye is present in each of the lateral  divisions of the face while from the oral region projects a forked  tongue.    It is of course hazardous to attempt a specific identification of these  figures but, as pointed out by Stempell (1908, p. 739), there are two  large scorpions in Yucatan (_Centruroides margaritatus_ and _C.  gracilis_) which are probably the species pictured in the codices.    The representations of the scorpion in the Tro-Cortesianus are almost  always associated with scenes of the hunt. As the deer is caught in a  trap so Foerstemann considers that Pl. 4, fig. 1, shows a trap with five  appliances, the \"tail\" one alone being effective. Brinton (1895, p. 75)  notes that the Mayas applied the term _sinaan ek_, \"scorpion stars\" to a  certain constellation and suggests that it was derived from the  Spaniards. There is certainly some association between the scorpion and  water as, in Tro-Cortesianus 7a, the fore and hind legs of the animal  enclose a body of water. The scorpion \"tail\" alone appears in  Tro-Cortesianus 31a and 82a as the tail of a god. Its significance is  difficult to make out. Destruction is indicated by the scorpion in the  Aubin manuscript as suggested by Seler (1900-1901, p. 71).    In the Nuttall Codex there is a remarkably beautiful conventionalization  of a scorpion (Pl. 4, fig. 3) in which the tripartite nature of the head  is still preserved though it is so reduced as to resemble the calyx of a  flower. The \"tail\", as elsewhere, and the legs are present.      PISCES    Figures of fish (Maya _kai_) occur commonly in the Maya codices in  various connections as well as in the stone carvings, but none of these  seems certainly identifiable. Among the representations, however, there  are clearly several species. One (Pl. 5, figs. 2, 6, 7-9; Pl. 6, fig. 9)  has a single dorsal fin, powerful teeth, and a generally ferocious  aspect and may represent some large predacious variety, perhaps a tunny.  The distinct operculum in most of the figures would preclude their  representing a shark. Other figures picture similar fish without the  prominent teeth (Pl. 5, fig. 4, 5; Pl. 6, figs. 2, 6, 10, 13). In two  cases the scales are diagramatically shown by straight or crescentric  lines (Pl. 5, fig. 4, 8). A third species of fish is shown provided with  two dorsal fins (Pl. 6, figs. 3, 11; Pl. 7, fig. 6, the last an  excellent stone carving). Others (Pl. 6, figs. 7, 14-17) represent  fishes without dorsal fins, one of which (fig. 7) from its length may be  an eel, possibly _Muraena_.    In the Nuttall Codex occurs a remarkable fish with an unmistakable wing  arising just behind the head nearly at the dorsal line. While this may  represent a flying fish (_Exocetus_), the head is so bird-like that the  whole may be merely a combination figure.    Of frequent occurrence in the Dresden is a glyph, two modifications of  which are here shown (Pl. 6, figs. 4, 5). Stempell suggests that the  vertical lines on the posterior portion of such figures may be gill  slits and that hence they may represent sharks in which these orifices  are without an operculum.    As with the molluscs, so with the fish, we naturally find them usually  associated with the water. This may be seen especially well in the  Nuttall Codex. In Dresden 33a (Pl. 6, fig. 13) the fish is clearly  associated with the operation of fishing as two figures are seated on  the edge of a body of water in the act of casting a net. An eel is shown  in the water under god B in Dresden 65b (Pl. 6, fig. 7) and fish are  shown just below the claws of a crocodile in text figure 1. In Dresden  44a god B holds a fish in his hands. As will be pointed out later (p.  314) this god is frequently associated with water. In Dresden 44c a fish  appears between god B and an unidentifiable deity. In the Maya codices  the greater number of representations of fish are in connection with  sacrifice. In Dresden 27 (Pl. 6, fig. 6) the fish is pictured resting on  two _Kan_ signs, the symbol of maize or bread, and these in turn on a  flat bowl. In Dresden 29b (Pl. 5, fig. 9) the fish is represented  between the red and black numbers of the _tonalamatl_. Here again the  fish is shown as an offering.    In two cases only do we find the fish used as a part of the head-dress  and in each case the fish is graphically shown as held in the mouth of a  heron. One of these is in the Dresden Codex 36b (Pl. 5, fig. 3) and one  in the stone carving of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque (Pl. 15,  fig. 5). Fish are often represented on the stone carvings as feeding  upon a water plant. This is seen in the border at the bottom of the  Lower Chamber of the Temple of the Tigers at Chichen Itza (Pl. 5, figs.  2, 4; Pl. 6, fig. 2). In several instances at Copan fish are shown as  forming the sides of the Great Cycle glyph at the beginning of an  Initial Series (Pl. 6, figs. 14-17). It has often been suggested that as  the word fish in Maya is _kai_ (usually written _cay_), there may be  some phonetic significance here, combining the fish, _kai_, with the  usually drum-like sign for stone, _tun_, making _kai tun_ or _katun_.  This is the term usually given not to the Great Cycle but to the period  composed of twenty _tuns_ and is probably derived from _kal_ meaning  twenty and _tun_, a stone.      AMPHIBIA    FROGS. Figures undoubtedly representing frogs (Maya _mut[vs]_ or _uo_)  or toads are found in several places in the codices and in the stone  carvings, but it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19053"],[0,"Theory of Circulation (#6)"],[1,"I have been assured by  one of the Editors), \"crushed out all that would take up his glove, and  is left in undisputed possession of the field--looking in vain for an  opponent.\"    In the meantime, in 1856, Dr. J. N. Draper, Professor of Chemistry and  Physiology in the University of New-York, in an elaborate work on \"Human  Physiology,\" has agreed that Harvey's theory of the paramount power of  the heart's action in the circulation must be abandoned; and that to  respiration must be assigned \"the great duty of originating the blood's  circulation.\"[11]    Dr. Washington has not only defended me in every important position  which I have taken, and added new illustrations--but he has made the  theory available to showing new proofs of the wisdom of God in the  creation of man. Thus--steam is formed in the vacuum of the lungs at the  low temperature of 67 deg., while, if there were no vacuum, 212 deg. of heat  would be required to produce it,--an impossible quantity, since it would  coagulate the albumen of the blood. But form the vacuum, and the boiling  of the blood with any degree of heat less than 101 deg. could not cause any  such disaster, while the steam going off from the lungs through the  arterial system to the capillaries, gradually condenses, warming the  body by giving off its latent heat; and the latent heat of vapor is the  same however it is formed, and is always 1,114 deg.. What divine wisdom and  economy are thus displayed!    Homoeopathy has, we believe, never found any difficulty in receiving this  theory. We know that, at one of its conventions held in Providence, it  was ably supported; and Dr. Marcy, whom I have the honor to address,  was, as we have seen, one of its earliest defenders. He has never,  whether allopathist or homoeopathist, been known to hesitate when his own  mind brought him clear conclusions;--the distinguishing mark, according  to Dugald Stewart, of intrepidity of character.                                        With profound respect,                                              EMMA WILLARD.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] It is here seen what an important work this theory does for the  venous circulation, and why the blood moves into the lungs. We have read  of a theory which maintains that it goes there because there is a mutual  attraction between it and the capillaries of the lungs. But there is  none between the water in our tube and that in the tin vessel where  water is boiling; but it goes into it with a rush notwithstanding.  Because there is a strong suction power produced by expansion, no other  attraction is needed. The apparatus, as here described, goes no farther  than to represent the circulation in single-hearted animals. But in my  work is a drawing which shows the left heart on the opposite of the  mimic lungs from the right; and then how the same tube, by being folded  in the form of a figure eight (8), shows the two hearts united into one,  and both ventricles working by the same contractions to perform their  different tasks.    [2] Mrs. B. Ogle Taylor, of Washington, formerly Miss Julia Dickinson,  of Troy, was thus found dead; and the late Mrs. Cass thus lost her life.  \"She was seized,\" says a newspaper account, \"in a hot bath, which she  had taken soon after eating.\" She lived an hour, unconscious, and the  physician said she died of congestion of the brain. How easily could  these highly intelligent ladies have kept themselves from danger, or  saved themselves when they felt it approaching, had they known and  understood these principles. For two reasons, in case of the failure of  the motive power from keeping the body too long in hot water, the blood  would be congested in the head. First, the head would not be immersed,  and, second, the last blood which the lungs sent forth would go to it.    [3] What can the Smithsonian Institute do better to carry out the views  with which the benevolent Smithson gave his fortune, than thus to teach  mankind when life may, by free circulation, be made to confer  enjoyment--how it may be inadvertently destroyed--and how it may be  restored, when, by drowning or otherwise, it is suspended? Sudden deaths  often occur by mal-position. That of the late Secretary Marcy is  doubtless an example. After his blood was heated and his circulation  quickened, he laid himself down on his back, his head not raised.  Attention to the workings of such a piece of apparatus as might be made,  would have shown the fatal effects of such a position at such a time.    [4] A young physician, whom I paid for correcting the proofs, was not  successful in preventing mistakes, especially in regard to numbers.    [5] I had just been reading Cuvier, to see whether he believed in the  Harveian theory of the circulation. I found he did not. \"The circulation  vortex,\" says he, \"is sometimes simple, sometimes double and even triple  (including that of the vena porta); the rapidity of its movements is  often _aided_ by the contraction of a certain fleshy apparatus  denominated hearts.\" Thus showing that my theory gave to the heart all  the prominence that was given to it by this great philosopher, who had  not, however, advanced any opinion as to the cause of the circulation.    [6] One of them, my lamented niece, Jane Porter Lincoln, at my request,  immediately wrote an account of the experiment, which is now in my  possession.    [7] These physicians gave certificates of their witnessing and assisting  at this memorable experiment, which were published in the _Boston  Medical Journal_, February 1852.    [8] Dr. Cartwright also reported the case in a letter which was  published in the _Boston Medical Journal_, September, 1852. This  resuscitation was more wonderful than those detailed in my published  work on \"Respiration.\" All cases of life thus restored are proofs _a  posteriori_ of the truth of this theory of the arterial circulation.    [9] Good systems of exercise have been made in some respectable  institutions for health, openly formed on the principles of this theory.  Such is that by Dr. Hamilton, of Saratoga.    [10] When the time shall come that, the truth of my discovery being no  longer denied, its originality shall be contested, it will be a  significant fact that, in the _Nashville Journal_, of September, 1854,  is an article against it from a physician signing himself \"Justicia,\"  which he thus heads, \"The Willardian Notion.\" In evil report, it was  indisputably mine. This article also shows, that the Harveian theory is  still maintained by the opposers of mine.    [11] See Draper's Physiology, p. 142."]]]
