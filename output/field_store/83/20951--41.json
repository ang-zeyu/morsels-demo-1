So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what made you do such a thing?  Haven't you ever been to church or learned your catechism or anything,  not to know it's wicked to steal?\" He spoke much more gently now, and  Peter said:--    \"I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure it wasn't. I thought  if I took it from the outside part of the heap, perhaps it would be. But  in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only mining. It'll  take thousands of years for you to burn up all that coal and get to the  middle parts.\"    \"Not quite. But did you do it for a lark or what?\"    \"Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill,\" said  Peter, indignantly.    \"Then why did you?\" The Station Master's voice was so much kinder now  that Peter replied:--    \"You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were too poor to have a  fire. We always had fires when it was cold at our other house, and--\"    \"DON'T!\" interrupted Bobbie, in a whisper.    \"Well,\" said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, \"I'll  tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this once. But you remember,  young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and what's mine isn't yours,  whether you call it mining or whether you don't. Run along home.\"    \"Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to us? Well, you are a  brick,\" said Peter, with enthusiasm.    \"You're a dear,\" said Bobbie.    \"You're a darling,\" said Phyllis.    \"That's all right,\" said the Station Master.    And on this they parted.    \"Don't speak to me,\" said Peter, as the three went up the hill. \"You're  spies and traitors--that's what you are.\"    But the girls were too glad to have Peter between them, safe and free,  and on the way to Three Chimneys and not to the Police Station, to mind  much what he said.    \"We DID say it was us as much as you,\" said Bobbie, gently.    \"Well--and it wasn't.\"    \"It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges,\" said  Phyllis. \"Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't our fault your secrets are so  jolly easy to find out.\" She took his arm, and he let her.    \"There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow,\" he went on.    \"Oh, don't!\" said Bobbie. \"I don't think we ought to be glad about  THAT.\"    \"I don't know,\" said Peter, plucking up a spirit. \"I'm not at all sure,  even now, that mining is a crime.\"    But the girls were quite sure. And they were also quite sure that he was  quite sure, however little he cared to own it.        Chapter III. The old gentleman.      After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to the children  to keep away from the station--but they did not, they could not, keep  away from the railway. They had lived all their lives in a street where  cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the carts of butchers  and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw a candlestick-maker's  cart; did you?) might occur at any moment. Here in the deep silence of  the sleeping country the only things that went by were the trains. They  seemed to be all that was left to link the children to the old life that  had once been theirs. Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys  the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the  crisp, short turf. They began to know the hours when certain trains  passed, and they gave names to them. The 9.15 up was called the Green  Dragon. The 10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight town  express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams  to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once, in chill  starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains, named it on the  spot.    It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled. He was a  very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were nice,  too, which is not at all the same thing. He had a fresh-coloured,  clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped collars  and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the same kind as other people's. Of  course the children didn't see all this at first. In fact the first  thing they noticed about the old gentleman was his hand.    It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the Green  Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter's Waterbury  watch that he had had given him on his last birthday.    \"The Green Dragon's going where Father is,\" said Phyllis; \"if it were  a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our love to  Father.\"    \"Dragons don't carry people's love,\" said Peter; \"they'd be above it.\"    \"Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and carry  like pet spaniels,\" said Phyllis, \"and feed out of your hand. I wonder  why Father never writes to us.\"    \"Mother says he's been too busy,\" said Bobbie; \"but he'll write soon,  she says.\"    \"I say,\" Phyllis suggested, \"let's all wave to the Green Dragon as it  goes by. If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take our loves to  Father. And if it isn't, three waves aren't much. We shall never miss  them.\"    So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its dark  lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the railing and  waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to think whether they  were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse. They were, as a matter of fact,  very much the reverse.    And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back. A quite clean hand.  It held a newspaper. It was the old gentleman's hand.    After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged between the  children and the 9.15.    And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that perhaps the  old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him 'in business,' wherever  that shady retreat might be, and tell him how his three children stood  on a rail far away in the green country and waved their love to him  every morning, wet or fine.    For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as they  would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in their  villa house. This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children felt more and  more that they had not been quite fair to this unattractive aunt, when  they found how useful were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that  they had laughed at her for buying for them.    Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing. She used to send  off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in them--and large  envelopes of different sizes and colours used to come to her. Sometimes  she would sigh when she opened them and say:--    \"Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!\" and then the  children would be very sorry.    But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and say:--\"Hooray,  hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken my story and this is the  proof of it.\"    At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter the sensible  Editor had written, but they presently got to know that the proof was  long slips of paper with the story printed on them.    Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.    One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to celebrate  the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children's Globe, when he met the  Station Master.    Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think over the  affair of the coal-mine. He did not like to say \"Good morning\" to the  Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you meet on a lonely road,  because he had a hot feeling, which spread even to his ears, that the  Station Master might not care to speak to a person who had stolen coals.  'Stolen' is a nasty word, but Peter felt it was the right one. So he  looked down, and said Nothing.    It was the Station Master who said \"Good morning\" as he passed by. And  Peter answered, \"Good morning.\" Then he thought:--    \"Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be so  polite.\"    And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him. And then  before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the Station Master,  who stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots crunching the road,  and coming up with him very breathless and with his ears now quite  magenta-coloured, he said:--    \"I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when you see  me.\"    \"Eh?\" said the Station Master.    \"I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the coals,\"  Peter went on, \"when you said 'Good morning.' But it was, and I'm sorry.  There.\"    \"Why,\" said the Station Master, \"I wasn't thinking anything at all about  the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And where were you off to in  such a hurry?\"    \"I'm going to buy buns for tea,\" said Peter.    \"I thought you were all so poor,\" said the Station Master.    \"So we are,\" said Peter, confidentially, \"but we always have three  pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a story or a  poem or anything.\"    \"Oh,\" said the Station Master, \"so your Mother writes stories, does  she?\"    \"The beautifulest you ever read,\" said Peter.    \"You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother.\"    \"Yes,\" said Peter, \"but she used to play with us more before she had to  be so clever.\"    \"Well,\" said the Station Master, \"I must be getting along. You give us  a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined. And as to coals,  it's a word that--well--oh, no, we never mention it, eh?\"    \"Thank you,\" said Peter. \"I'm very glad it's all straightened out  between us.\" And he went on across the canal bridge to the village to  get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than he had felt  since the hand of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#6)"],[1,"is desired to report as pounds  to the ton, then, since there are 2240 lbs. to the ton, a weight of  2.240 grams may be taken as the assay ton, and each 0.001 gram yielded  will equal 1 lb., or 22.4 grams may represent the ton, and each 0.01  gram a pound. Similarly, since there are 32,666.6 ozs. troy to the ton;  if we take 32.6667 grams as the assay ton, each 0.001 gram will equal 1  oz. to the ton. In some cases it may be convenient to have, in addition  to the usual gram weights, one or other of the \"assay tons\" mentioned  above, but generally it is better to work on a purely decimal system,  and convert when required into ounces per ton, &c., either by actual  calculation or by reference to a set of tables.

[2] Such substances are best dried by pressing between folds of dry  filter-paper.          CHAPTER II.    METHODS OF ASSAYING.--DRY GRAVIMETRIC METHODS.      The methods of assaying are best classed under two heads, Gravimetric  and Volumetric, in the former of which the final results are weighed,  whilst in the latter they are measured. A commoner and older division is  expressed in the terms much used in practice--wet assays and dry assays.  Wet assays include all those in which solvents, &c. (liquid at the  ordinary temperature), are mainly used; and dry assays, those in which  solid re-agents are almost exclusively employed. Dry assays form a  branch of gravimetric work, and we shall include under this head all  those assays requiring the help of a wind furnace. Wet assays, as  generally understood, would include not only those which we class as wet  gravimetric assays, but also all the volumetric processes.    ~Gravimetric Methods~ aim at the separation of the substance from the  other matters present in the ore, so that it may be weighed; and,  therefore, they must yield the _whole_ of the substance in a pure state.  It is not necessary that a metal should be weighed as metal; it may be  weighed in the form of a compound of definite and well known  composition. For example, one part by weight of silver chloride contains  (and, if pure, always contains) 0.7527 part of silver; and a quantity of  this metal can be as exactly determined by weighing it as chloride as by  weighing it in the metallic state. But in either case the metal or its  chloride must be pure.    Exact purity and complete separation are not easily obtained; and  methods are used which are defective in one or both of these respects.  It is well to note that an impure product increases the result, whilst a  loss of the substance decreases it; so that if both defects exist in a  process they tend to neutralise each other. Of dry methods generally, it  may be said that they neither give the whole of the substance nor give  it pure; so that they are only calculated to show the amount of metal  that can be extracted on a manufacturing scale, and not the actual  quantity of it present. Their determinations are generally rough and  always low. The gold and silver determinations, however, will compare  very favourably with any of the other processes for the estimation of  these metals in their ores.    The calculation of the results of a gravimetric assay has already been  referred to. If the result is to be stated as percentage, it may always  be done by the following rule:--_Multiply the weight of the substance  got by the percentage of metal it contains, and divide by the weight of  ore taken._    Gravimetric methods are divided into three groups: (1) mechanical  separations; (2) dry methods; and (3) wet methods.    ~Mechanical Separations.~--Under this head are classed the method of  assaying tin ores, known as vanning, and the amalgamation assay for  gold. A set of sieves to determine the relative proportion of powders of  different degrees of fineness is sometimes useful. A set with 10, 20, 40  and 80 meshes to the inch is convenient.    ~Dry Assays.~--An important distinction between wet and dry methods of  assaying is, that in the former the substance is got into the liquid  state by solution, whilst in the latter fusion is taken advantage of.    The difference between solution and fusion is easily illustrated: a lump  of sugar heated over a candle-flame melts or fuses; suspended in water  it dissolves. Many substances which are insoluble or infusible of  themselves, become soluble or fusible when mixed with certain others;  thus, in this way, solution is got with the aid of reagents, and fusion  with the help of fluxes. For example, lead is insoluble in water, but if  nitric acid be added, the metal rapidly disappears. It is convenient,  but somewhat inaccurate, to say that the acid dissolves the lead. If the  lead be acted on by nitric acid alone, without water, it is converted  into a white powder, which does not dissolve until water is added; in  this case it is obvious that the water is the solvent. The function of  the acid is to convert the lead into a soluble compound.    ~Fluxes~ may act as true solvents. Fused carbonate of soda dissolves  baric carbonate, and perhaps in many slags true solution occurs; but in  the great majority of cases a flux is a solid reagent added for the  purpose of forming a fusible _compound_ with the earthy or stony  minerals of the ore. Few of the minerals which occur in the gangue of an  ore are fusible; and still fewer are sufficiently fusible for the  purposes of the assayer, consequently the subject is one of importance,  and it ought to be treated on chemical principles. An idea of the  composition of some of the more frequently occurring rocks may be  gathered from the following table, which represents rough averages:--      -----------------------------------------------------------------                         |       |        |Oxide|Lime and |                         |Silica.|Alumina.| of  |Magnesia.|Alkalies.                         |       |        |iron |         |    -----------------------------------------------------------------                         |   %   |    %   |  %  |      %  |   %    Sandstone, grit,     |       |        |     |         |      quartzite, &c.     |80-100 |   --   | --  |     --  |  --    Granite, gneiss,     |       |        |     |         |      quartz-porphyry,   |       |        |     |         |      fire-clay, &c.     | 70-75 | 13-20  |  2  |      2  | 5-8                         |       |        |     |         |Less in                         |       |        |     |         |fire-clay.

The addition of lime,  oxide of iron, or alkali to silicate of alumina results in the formation  of a double silicate of alumina and lime, or of alumina and iron, &c.,  all of which are easily fusible. Similarly, if to a silicate of lime we  add oxide of iron, or soda, or even alumina, a fusible double silicate  will be formed. Thus lime, soda, oxide of iron, and clay, are _fluxes_  when properly used; but since lime, clay (and oxide of iron if there be  any tendency to form peroxide), are of themselves infusible, any excess  of these fluxes would tend to stiffen and render pasty the resulting  slag. So, too, soda, which is a very strong base, may act prejudicially  if it be in sufficient excess to set free notable quantities of lime and  magnesia,"]]]
