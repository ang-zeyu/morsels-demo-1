Thou mayst take the  arms upon yonder rack, and use them until otherwise bidden. Thou seest  that the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen; that will be  thy number for the nonce.\"    So Myles armed himself from his rack as the others were doing from  theirs. The armor was rude and heavy, used to accustom the body to the  weight of the iron plates rather than for any defence. It consisted of  a cuirass, or breastplate of iron, opening at the side with hinges, and  catching with hooks and eyes; epauliers, or shoulder-plates; arm-plates  and leg-pieces; and a bascinet, or open-faced helmet. A great triangular  shield covered with leather and studded with bosses of iron, and a heavy  broadsword, pointed and dulled at the edges, completed the equipment.    The practice at the pels which Myles was bidden to attend comprised the  chief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers of  that time, and in it they learned not only all the strokes, cuts, and  thrusts of sword-play then in vogue, but also toughness, endurance, and  elastic quickness. The pels themselves consisted of upright posts of  ash or oak, about five feet six inches in height, and in girth somewhat  thicker than a man's thigh. They were firmly planted in the ground, and  upon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed.    At Devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tilting  courts and the archery ranges, and thither those lads not upon household  duty were marched every morning excepting Fridays and Sundays, and were  there exercised under the direction of Sir James Lee and two assistants.  The whole company was divided into two, sometimes into three parties,  each of which took its turn at the exercise, delivering at the word  of command the various strokes, feints, attacks, and retreats as the  instructors ordered.    After five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pour  down the faces, and the breath to come thick and short; but it was not  until the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was given  to rest, and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon the  ground, while another company took its place at the triple row of posts.    As Myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him, Sir James Lee  stood beside him watching him in grim silence. The lad did his best to  show the knight all that he knew of upper cut, under cut, thrust, and  back-hand stroke, but it did not seem to him that Sir James was very  well satisfied with his skill.    \"Thou fightest like a clodpole,\" said the old man. \"Ha, that stroke  was but ill-recovered. Strike me it again, and get thou in guard more  quickly.\"    Myles repeated the stroke.    \"Pest!\" cried Sir James. \"Thou art too slow by a week. Here, strike thou  the blow at me.\"    Myles hesitated. Sir James held a stout staff in his hand, but otherwise  he was unarmed.    \"Strike, I say!\" said Sir James. \"What stayest thou for? Art afeard?\"    It was Myles's answer that set the seal of individuality upon him.  \"Nay,\" said he, boldly, \"I am not afeard. I fear not thee nor any man!\"  So saying, he delivered the stroke at Sir James with might and main. It  was met with a jarring blow that made his wrist and arm tingle, and the  next instant he received a stroke upon the bascinet that caused his ears  to ring and the sparks to dance and fly before his eyes.    \"Pardee!\" said Sir James, grimly. \"An I had had a mace in my hand, I  would have knocked thy cockerel brains out that time. Thou mayst take  that blow for answering me so pertly. And now we are quits. Now strike  me the stroke again an thou art not afeard.\"    Myles's eyes watered in spite of himself, and he shut the lids tight to  wink the dimness away. Nevertheless he spoke up undauntedly as before.  \"Aye, marry, will I strike it again,\" said he; and this time he was  able to recover guard quickly enough to turn Sir James's blow with his  shield, instead of receiving it upon his head.    \"So!\" said Sir James. \"Now mind thee of this, that when thou strikest  that lower cut at the legs, recover thyself more quickly. Now, then,  strike me it at the pel.\"    Gascoyne and other of the lads who were just then lying stretched out  upon the grass beneath, a tree at the edge of the open court where stood  the pels, were interested spectators of the whole scene. Not one of them  in their memory had heard Sir James so answered face to face as Myles  had answered him, and, after all, perhaps the lad himself would not  have done so had he been longer a resident in the squires' quarters at  Devlen.    \"By 'r Lady! thou art a cool blade, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, as they  marched back to the armory again. \"Never heard I one bespeak Sir James  as thou hast done this day.\"    \"And, after all,\" said another of the young squires, \"old Bruin was not  so ill-pleased, methinks. That was a shrewd blow he fetched thee on the  crown, Falworth. Marry, I would not have had it on my own skull for a  silver penny.\"        CHAPTER 7    So little does it take to make a body's reputation.    That night all the squires' quarters buzzed with the story of how the  new boy, Falworth, had answered Sir James Lee to his face without fear,  and had exchanged blows with him hand to hand. Walter Blunt himself was  moved to some show of interest.    \"What said he to thee, Falworth?\" asked he.    \"He said naught,\" said Myles, brusquely. \"He only sought to show me how  to recover from the under cut.\"    \"It is passing strange that he should take so much notice of thee as to  exchange blows with thee with his own hand. Haply thou art either very  quick or parlous slow at arms.\"    \"It is quick that he is,\" said Gascoyne, speaking up in his friend's  behalf. \"For the second time that Falworth delivered the stroke, Sir  James could not reach him to return; so I saw with mine own eyes.\"    But that very sterling independence that had brought Myles so creditably  through this adventure was certain to embroil him with the rude,  half-savage lads about him, some of whom, especially among the  bachelors, were his superiors as well in age as in skill and training.  As said before, the bachelors had enforced from the younger boys a  fagging sort of attendance on their various personal needs, and it was  upon this point that Myles first came to grief. As it chanced, several  days passed before any demand was made upon him for service to the heads  of the squirehood, but when that demand was made, the bachelors were  very quick to see that the boy who was bold enough to speak up to Sir  James Lee was not likely to be a willing fag for them.    \"I tell thee, Francis,\" he said, as Gascoyne and he talked over the  matter one day--\"I tell thee I will never serve them. Prithee, what  shame can be fouler than to do such menial service, saving for one's  rightful Lord?\"    \"Marry!\" quoth Gascoyne; \"I reason not of shame at this or that. All I  know is that others serve them who are haply as good and maybe better  than I be, and that if I do not serve them I get knocked i' th' head  therefore, which same goeth soothly against my stomach.\"    \"I judge not for thee,\" said Myles. \"Thou art used to these castle  ways, but only I know that I will not serve them, though they be thirty  against me instead of thirteen.\"    \"Then thou art a fool,\" said Gascoyne, dryly.    Now in this matter of service there was one thing above all others that  stirred Myles Falworth's ill-liking. The winter before he had come to  Devlen, Walter Blunt, who was somewhat of a Sybarite in his way, and who  had a repugnance to bathing in the general tank in the open armory court  in frosty weather, had had Dick Carpenter build a trough in the corner  of the dormitory for the use of the bachelors, and every morning it was  the duty of two of the younger squires to bring three pails of water to  fill this private tank for the use of the head esquires. It was seeing  two of his fellow-esquires fetching and carrying this water that Myles  disliked so heartily, and every morning his bile was stirred anew at the  sight.    \"Sooner would I die than yield to such vile service,\" said he.    He did not know how soon his protestations would be put to the test.    One night--it was a week or two after Myles had come to Devlen--Blunt  was called to attend the Earl at livery. The livery was the last meal of  the day, and was served with great pomp and ceremony about nine o'clock  at night to the head of the house as he lay in bed. Curfew had not yet  rung, and the lads in the squires' quarters were still wrestling and  sparring and romping boisterously in and out around the long row of rude  cots in the great dormitory as they made ready for the night. Six or  eight flaring links in wrought-iron brackets that stood out from the  wall threw a great ruddy glare through the barrack-like room--a light of  all others to romp by. Myles and Gascoyne were engaged in defending the  passage-way between their two cots against the attack of three other  lads, and Myles held his sheepskin coverlet rolled up into a ball and  balanced in his hand, ready for launching at the head of one of the  others so soon as it should rise from behind the shelter of a cot. Just  then Walter Blunt, dressed with more than usual care, passed by on his  way to the Earl's house. He stopped for a moment and said, \"Mayhaps I  will not be in until late to-night. Thou and Falworth, Gascoyne, may  fetch water to-morrow.\"    Then he was gone. Myles stood staring after his retreating figure with  eyes open and mouth agape, still holding the ball of sheepskin balanced  in his hand. Gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank,  stupefied face, but the next moment he laid his hand on his friend's  shoulder.    \"Myles,\" he said, \"thou wilt not make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#6)"],[1,"reaches of plain.    But when I could look at her I seldom wasted time on scenery. Looking at  her now I tried to get again that impression of a difference in her. It  eluded me.    Just now with the rose in her brown cheeks, her hair flying, her eyes  with grave instead of mocking light, she seemed only prettier than  usual. I got down ostensibly to tighten the saddle girths on her horse.  But I lingered over the task.    Presently, when she looked down at me, I received that subtle impression  of change, and read it as her soft mood of dangerous sweetness that came  so seldom, mingled with something deeper, more of character and  womanliness than I had ever sensed in her.    \"Russ, it wasn't nice to tell Diane that,\" she said.    \"Nice! It was--oh, I'd like to swear!\" I ejaculated. \"But now I  understand my miserable feeling. I was jealous, Sally, I'm sorry. I  apologize.\"    She had drawn off her gloves, and one little hand, brown, shapely,  rested upon her knee very near to me. I took it in mine. She let it  stay, though she looked away from me, the color rich in her cheeks.    \"I can forgive that,\" she murmured. \"But the lie. Jealousy doesn't  excuse a lie.\"    \"You mean--what I intimated to your cousin,\" I said, trying to make her  look at me. \"That was the devil in me. Only it's true.\"    \"How can it be true when you never asked--said a word--you hinted of?\"  she queried. \"Diane believed what you said. I know she thinks me  horrid.\"    \"No she doesn't. As for what I said, or meant to say, which is the same  thing, how'd you take my actions? I hope not the same as you take  Wright's or the other fellow's.\"    Sally was silent, a little pale now, and I saw that I did not need to  say any more about the other fellows. The change, the difference was now  marked. It drove me to give in wholly to this earnest and passionate  side of myself.    \"Sally, I do love you. I don't know how you took my actions. Anyway, now  I'll make them plain. I was beside myself with love and jealousy. Will  you marry me?\"    She did not answer. But the old willful Sally was not in evidence.  Watching her face I gave her a slow and gentle pull, one she could  easily resist if she cared to, and she slipped from her saddle into my  arms.    Then there was one wildly sweet moment in which I had the blissful  certainty that she kissed me of her own accord. She was abashed, yet  yielding; she let herself go, yet seemed not utterly unstrung. Perhaps  I was rough, held her too hard, for she cried out a little.    \"Russ! Let me go. Help me--back.\"    I righted her in the saddle, although not entirely releasing her.    \"But, Sally, you haven't told me anything,\" I remonstrated tenderly. \"Do  you love me?\"    \"I think so,\" she whispered.    \"Sally, will you marry me?\"    She disengaged herself then, sat erect and faced away from me, with her  breast heaving.    \"No, Russ,\" she presently said, once more calm.    \"But Sally--if you love me--\" I burst out, and then stopped, stilled by  something in her face.    \"I can't help--loving you, Russ,\" she said. \"But to promise to marry  you, that's different. Why, Russ, I know nothing about you, not even  your last name. You're not a--a steady fellow. You drink, gamble, fight.  You'll kill somebody yet. Then I'll _not_ love you. Besides, I've always  felt you're not just what you seemed. I can't trust you. There's  something wrong about you.\"    I knew my face darkened, and perhaps hope and happiness died in it.  Swiftly she placed a kind hand on my shoulder.    \"Now, I've hurt you. Oh, I'm sorry. Your asking me makes such a  difference. _They_ are not in earnest. But, Russ, I had to tell you  why I couldn't be engaged to you.\"    \"I'm not good enough for you. I'd no right to ask you to marry me,\" I  replied abjectly.    \"Russ, don't think me proud,\" she faltered. \"I wouldn't care who you  were if I could only--only respect you. Some things about you are  splendid, you're such a man, that's why I cared. But you gamble. You  drink--and I _hate_ that. You're dangerous they say, and I'd be, I _am_  in constant dread you'll kill somebody. Remember, Russ, I'm no Texan.\"    This regret of Sally's, this faltering distress at giving me pain, was  such sweet assurance that she did love me, better than she knew, that I  was divided between extremes of emotion.    \"Will you wait? Will you trust me a little? Will you give me a chance?  After all, maybe I'm not so bad as I seem.\"    \"Oh, if you weren't! Russ, are you asking me to trust you?\"    \"I beg you to--dearest. Trust me and wait.\"    \"Wait? What for? Are you really on the square, Russ? Or are you what  George calls you--a drunken cowboy, a gambler, sharp with the cards, a  gun-fighter?\"    My face grew cold as I felt the blood leave it. At that moment mention  of George Wright fixed once for all my hate of him.    Bitter indeed was it that I dared not give him the lie. But what could  I do? The character Wright gave me was scarcely worse than what I had  chosen to represent. I had to acknowledge the justice of his claim, but  nevertheless I hated him.    \"Sally, I ask you to trust me in spite of my reputation.\"    \"You ask me a great deal,\" she replied.    \"Yes, it's too much. Let it be then only this--you'll wait. And while  you wait, promise not to flirt with Wright and Waters.\"    \"Russ, I'll not let George or any of them so much as dare touch me,\" she  declared in girlish earnestness, her voice rising. \"I'll promise if  you'll promise me not to go into those saloons any more.\"    One word would have brought her into my arms for good and all. The  better side of Sally Langdon showed then in her appeal. That appeal was  as strong as the drawing power of her little face, all eloquent with its  light, and eyes dark with tears, and lips wanting to smile.    My response should have been instant. How I yearned to give it and win  the reward I imagined I saw on her tremulous lips! But I was bound. The  grim, dark nature of my enterprise there in Linrock returned to stultify  my eagerness, dispel my illusion, shatter my dream.    For one instant it flashed through my mind to tell Sally who I was, what  my errand was, after the truth. But the secret was not mine to tell. And  I kept my pledges.    The hopeful glow left Sally's face. Her disappointment seemed keen. Then  a little scorn of certainty was the bitterest of all for me to bear.    \"That's too much to promise all at once,\" I protested lamely, and I knew  I would have done better to keep silence.    \"Russ, a promise like that is nothing--if a man loves a girl,\" she  retorted. \"Don't make any more love to me, please, unless you want me to  laugh at you. And don't feel such terrible trouble if you happen to see  me flirting occasionally.\"    She ended with a little mocking laugh. That was the perverse side of  her, the cat using her claws. I tried not to be angry, but failed.    \"All right. I'll take my medicine,\" I replied bitterly. \"I'll certainly  never make love to you again. And I'll stand it if I happen to see  Waters kiss you, or any other decent fellow. But look out how you let  that damned backbiter Wright fool around you!\"    I spoke to her as I had never spoken before, in quick, fierce meaning,  with eyes holding hers.    She paled. But even my scarce-veiled hint did not chill her anger.  Tossing her head she wheeled and rode away.    I followed at a little distance, and thus we traveled the ten miles back  to the ranch. When we reached the corrals she dismounted and, turning  her horse over to Dick, she went off toward the house without so much as  a nod or good-by to me.    I went down to town for once in a mood to live up to what had been  heretofore only a sham character.    But turning a corner into the main street I instantly forgot myself at  the sight of a crowd congregated before the town hall. There was a babel  of voices and an air of excitement that I immediately associated with  Sampson, who as mayor of Linrock, once in a month of moons held court in  this hall.    It took slipping and elbowing to get through the crowd. Once inside the  door I saw that the crowd was mostly outside, and evidently not so  desirous as I was to enter.    The first man I saw was Steele looming up; the next was Sampson chewing  his mustache--the third, Wright, whose dark and sinister face told much.  Something was up in Linrock. Steele had opened the hall.    There were other men in the hall, a dozen or more, and all seemed  shouting excitedly in unison with the crowd outside. I did not try to  hear what was said. I edged closer in, among the men to the front.    Sampson sat at a table up on a platform. Near him sat a thick-set  grizzled man, with deep eyes; and this was Hanford Owens, county judge.    To the right stood a tall, angular, yellow-faced fellow with a drooping,  sandy mustache. Conspicuous on his vest was a huge silver shield. This  was Gorsech, one of Sampson's sheriffs.    There were four other men whom I knew, several whose faces were  familiar, and half a dozen strangers, all dusty horsemen.    Steele stood apart from them, a little to one side, so that he faced  them all. His hair was disheveled, and his shirt open at the neck. He  looked cool and hard.    When I caught his eye I realized in an instant that the long deferred  action, the beginning of our real fight was at hand.    Sampson pounded hard on the table to be heard. Mayor or not, he was  unable at once to quell the excitement.    Gradually, however, it subsided and from the last few utterances before  quiet was restored I gathered that Steele had intruded upon some kind of  a meeting in the hall.    \"Steele, what'd you break in here for?\" demanded Sampson.    \"Isn't this court? Aren't you the mayor of Linrock?\" interrogated  Steele. His voice was so clear and loud, almost piercing, that I saw at  once that he wanted all those outside to hear.    \"Yes,\" replied Sampson. Like flint he seemed, yet I felt his intense"]]]
