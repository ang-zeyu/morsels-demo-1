Then the Decoration Day parade went on, and everyone said how brave Uncle  Wiggily was. But he hadn't yet found his fortune, and so in the story  after this in case our front porch doesn't run away, and take the back  steps with it, so I have to sleep on the doormat, I'll tell you about  Uncle Wiggily in the fountain.          STORY VIII    UNCLE WIGGILY IN THE FOUNTAIN      Well, after the Decoration Day parade, and the things that happened in it,  such as the pony running away with Jimmie Wibblewobble, Uncle Wiggily  Longears thought he'd like to go off to some quiet place and rest.    \"Oh, can't you come with me?\" asked Percival, the old circus dog. \"We'll  go to the Bow-Wows house, and have something to eat.\"    \"No, I'm afraid I can't go,\" replied the old gentleman rabbit. \"You see I  must travel on to seek my fortune, for I haven't found it yet, and I still  have the rheumatism.\"    \"Why don't you try to lose that rheumatism somewhere?\" asked Percival. \"I  would, if it's such a bother.\"    \"Oh, I've tried and tried and tried, but I can't seem to lose it,\" replied  Uncle Wiggily. \"So I think I'll travel on. I'm much obliged to you for  letting me march in the parade.\"    Then the old gentleman rabbit got his valise, and, with his crutch, he  once more started off. He went on and on, up one hill and down another,  over the fields where the horses and cows and sheep were pulling up the  grass, and chewing it, so the man wouldn't have to cut it with the lawn  mower; on and on he went. Then Uncle Wiggily reached the woods, where the  ferns and wild flowers grow.    \"This is a fine place,\" he said as he sat down on a flat stump. \"I think I  will eat my dinner,\" so he opened the satchel, and took out a sandwich  made of yellow carrots and red beets, and very pretty they looked on the  white bread, let me tell you; very nice indeed!    Uncle Wiggily was eating away, and he was brushing the crumbs off his nose  by wiggling his ears, when, all of a sudden, he heard a cat crying. Oh,  such a loud cry as it was!    \"Why, some poor kittie must be lost,\" thought the old gentleman rabbit.  \"I'll see if I can find it.\"    Then the cry sounded again, and, in another moment, out of a tree flew a  big bird.    \"Oh, maybe that bird stuck his sharp beak in the kittie and made it cry,\"  thought Uncle Wiggily. \"Bird, did you do that?\" he asked, calling to the  bird, who was flying around in the air.    \"Did I do what?\" asked the bird.    \"Did you stick the kittie, and make it cry?\"    \"Oh, no,\" answered the bird. \"I made that cat-crying noise myself. I am a  cat-bird, you know,\" and surely enough that bird went \"Mew! Mew! Mew!\"  three times, just like that, exactly as if a cat had cried under your  window, when you were trying to go to sleep.    \"Ha! That is very strange!\" exclaimed the rabbit. \"So you are a cat-bird.\"    \"Yes, and my little birds are kittie-birds,\" was the answer. \"I'll show  you.\"    So the bird went \"Mew! Mew! Mew!\" again, and a lot of the little birds  came flying around and they all went \"Mew! Mew!\" too, just like kitties.  Oh, I tell you cat-birds are queer things! and how they do love cherries  when they are ripe! Eh?    \"That is very good crying, birdies,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"and I think I'll  give you something to eat, to pay for it.\" So he took out from his valise  some peanuts, that Percival, the circus dog, had given him, and Uncle  Wiggily fed them to the cat-bird and her kittie-birds.    \"You are very kind,\" said the mamma bird, \"and if we can ever do you a  favor we will.\"    And now listen, as the telephone girl says, those birds are going to do  Uncle Wiggily a favor in a short time--a very short time indeed.    Well, after the birds had eaten all the peanuts they flew away, and Uncle  Wiggily started off once more. He hadn't gone very far before he came to  a fountain. You know what that is. It's a thing in a park that squirts up  water, just like when you fill a rubber ball with milk or lemonade and  squeeze it. Only a fountain is bigger, of course.    This fountain that Uncle Wiggily came to had no water in it, for it was  being cleaned. There was a big basin, with a pipe up through the middle,  and this was where the water spouted up when it was running.    \"This is very strange,\" said Uncle Wiggily, for he had never seen a  fountain before, \"perhaps I can find my fortune in here. I'll go look.\" So  down he jumped into the big empty fountain basin, which was as large as  seven wash tubs made into one. And it was so nice and comfortable there,  and so shady, for there were trees near it, that, before he knew it, Uncle  Wiggily fell fast asleep, with his head on his satchel for a pillow.    And then he had a funny dream. He dreamed that it was raining, and that  his umbrella turned inside out, and got full of holes, and that he was  getting all wet.    \"My!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he gave a big sneeze. \"This is a very  real dream. I actually believe I _am_ wet!\"    Then he got real wide awake all of a sudden, and he found that he was  right in the middle of a lot of wetness, for the man had turned the water  on in the fountain unexpectedly, not knowing that the old gentleman  rabbit was asleep there.    \"I must get out of here!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, as he grabbed up his valise  and crutch. Then the water came up to his little short, stumpy tail. Next  it rose higher, up to his knees. Then it rose still faster up to his front  feet and then almost up to his chin.    \"Oh, I'm afraid I'm going to drown!\" he cried. \"I must get out!\" So he  tried to swim to the edge of the fountain, but you can't swim very well  with a crutch and a valise, you know, and Uncle Wiggily didn't want to  lose either one. Then the water from the top of the fountain splashed in  his eyes and he couldn't see which way to swim.    \"Oh, help! Help!\" he cried. \"Will no one help me?\"    \"Yes, we will help you!\" answered a voice, and up flew the big cat-bird,  and her little kitten-birds. \"Quick, children!\" she cried, \"we must save  Uncle Wiggily, who was so kind to us! Every one of you get a stick, and  we'll make a little boat, or raft, for him!\"    Well, I wish you could have seen how quickly the mamma cat-bird and her  kittie-birds gathered a lot of sticks, and twigs, and laid them together  crossways on the water in that fountain basin, until they had a regular  little boat. Upon this Uncle Wiggily climbed, with his crutch and valise,  and then the mamma cat-bird flew on ahead, and pulled the boat by a string  to the edge of the fountain, where the rabbit could safely get out.    So that's how the bunny was saved from drowning in the water, and in the  next story, if a big, red ant doesn't crawl upon our porch and carry away  the hammock, I'll tell you another adventure Uncle Wiggily had. It will be  a story of the old gentleman rabbit and the bad dog.          STORY IX    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DOG      Uncle Wiggily's rheumatism was quite bad after he got wet in the fountain,  as I told you in the other story, and when he thanked the mamma cat-bird  and her kitten-birds for saving him, he found that he could hardly walk,  much less carry his heavy valise.    \"Oh, we'll help you,\" said Mrs. Cat-Bird. \"Here, Flitter and Flutter, you  carry the satchel for Uncle Wiggily, and we'll take him to our house.\"    \"But, mamma,\" said Flutter, who was getting to be quite a big bird-boy,  \"Uncle Wiggily can't climb up a tree to our nest.\"    \"No, but we can make him a nice warm bed on the ground,\" said the mamma  bird. \"So you and Flitter carry the satchel. Put a long blade of grass  through the handle, and then each of you take hold of one end of the grass  in your bills, and fly away with it. Skimmer, you and Dartie go on ahead,  and get something ready to eat, and I'll show Uncle Wiggily the way.\"    So Flitter and Flutter, the two boy birds, flew away with the satchel, and  Skimmer and Dartie, the girl birds, flew on ahead to set the table, and  put on the teakettle on the stove to boil, and Mrs. Cat-Bird flew slowly  on over Uncle Wiggily, to show him the way.    Well, pretty soon, not so so very long, they came to where the birds  lived. And those good children had already started to make a nest on the  ground for the old gentleman rabbit. They had it almost finished, and by  the time supper was ready it was all done. Then came the meal, and those  birds couldn't do enough for Uncle Wiggily, because they liked him so.    When it got dark, they covered him all up, with soft leaves in the nest on  the ground, and there he slept until morning. His rheumatism wasn't quite  so bad when, after breakfast, he had sat out in the warm sun for a while,  and after a bit he said:    \"Well, I think I'll travel along now, and see if I can find my fortune  to-day. Perhaps I may, and if I do I'll come back and bring you more  peanuts.\"    \"Oh, that'll be fine and dandy!\" cried Flitter and Flutter, and Skimmer  and Dartie. So they said good-by to the old gentleman rabbit, and once  more he started off.    \"My! I'm certainly getting to be a great traveler,\" he thought as he  walked along through the woods and over the fields. \"But I don't ever  seem to get to any place. Something always happens to me. I hope  everything goes along nicely to-day.\"    But you just wait and see what takes place. I'm afraid something is going  to happen very shortly, but it's not my fault, and all I can do is to tell  you exactly all about it. Wait! There, it's beginning to happen now.    All of a sudden, as Uncle Wiggily was traveling along, he came to a place  in the woods where a whole lot of Gypsies had their wagons and tents. And  on one tent, in which was an old brown and wrinkled Gypsy lady, there was  a sign which read:    FORTUNES TOLD HERE.    \"Ha! If they tell fortunes in that tent, perhaps the Gypsy lady can tell  me where to find mine,\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll go up and ask her.\"    Well, he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#6)"],[1,". But that item of area is a variable quantity in the equation.  It changes its character at a higher stage of cultural development.  Consequently, when the Muscovite people, instructed by the example of  western Europe, shall have grown up intellectually, economically and  politically to their big territory, its area will become a great  national asset. Russia will come into its own, heir to a long-withheld  inheritance. Many of its previous geographic disadvantages will vanish,  like the diseases of childhood, while its massive size will dwarf many  previous advantages of its European neighbors.    [Sidenote: Evolution of world relations.]    This evolution of geographic relations applies not only to the local  environment, but also to the wider world relations of a people. Greeks  and Syrians, English and Japanese, take a different rank among the  nations of the earth to-day from that held by their ancestors 2,000 years  ago, simply because the world relations of civilized peoples have been  steadily expanding since those far-back days of Tyrian and Athenian  supremacy. The period of maritime discoveries in the fifteenth and  sixteenth centuries shifted the foci of the world relations of European  states from enclosed seas to the rim of the Atlantic. Venice and Genoa  gave way to Cadiz and Lagos, just as sixteen centuries before Corinth  and Athens had yielded their ascendency to Rome and Ostia. The keen but  circumscribed trade of the Baltic, which gave wealth and historical  preeminence to Luebeck and the other Hanse Towns of northern Germany from  the twelfth to the seventeenth century, lost its relative importance  when the Atlantic became the maritime field of history. Maritime  leadership passed westward from Luebeck and Stralsund to Amsterdam and  Bristol, as the historical horizon widened. England, prior to this  sudden dislocation, lay on the outskirts of civilized Europe, a terminal  land, not a focus. The peripheral location which retarded her early  development became a source of power when she accumulated sufficient  density of population for colonizing enterprises, and when maritime  discovery opened a way to trans-oceanic lands.[9]    Meanwhile, local geographic advantages in the old basins remain the  same, although they are dwarfed by the development of relatively greater  advantages elsewhere. The broken coastline, limited area and favorable  position of Greece make its people to-day a nation of seamen, and enable  them to absorb by their considerable merchant fleet a great part of the  trade of the eastern Mediterranean,[10] just as they did in the days of  Pericles; but that youthful Aegean world which once constituted so large  a part of the _oikoumene_, has shrunken to a modest province, and its  highways to local paths. The coast cities of northern Germany still  maintain a large commerce in the Baltic, but no longer hold the  pre-eminence of the old Hanse Towns. The glory of the Venetian Adriatic  is gone; but that the sea has still a local significance is proven by  the vast sums spent by Austria and Hungary on their hand-made harbors of  Trieste and Fiume.[11] The analytical geographer, therefore, while  studying a given combination of geographic forces, must be prepared for  a momentous readjustment and a new interplay after any marked turning  point in the economic, cultural, or world relations of a people.    [Sidenote: Interplay of geographic factors.]    Skepticism as to the effect of geographic conditions upon human  development is apparently justifiable, owing to the multiplicity of the  underlying causes and the difficulty of distinguishing between stronger  and weaker factors on the one hand, as between permanent and temporary  effects on the other. We see the result, but find it difficult to state  the equation producing this result. But the important thing is to avoid  seizing upon one or two conspicuous geographic elements in the problem  and ignoring the rest. The physical environment of a people consists of  all the natural conditions to which they have been subjected, not merely  a part. Geography admits no single blanket theory. The slow historical  development of the Russian folk has been due to many geographic  causes--to excess of cold and deficiency of rain, an outskirt location  on the Asiatic border of Europe exposed to the attacks of nomadic  hordes, a meager and, for the most part, ice-bound coast which was  slowly acquired, an undiversified surface, a lack of segregated regions  where an infant civilization might be cradled, and a vast area of  unfenced plains wherein the national energies spread out thin and  dissipated themselves. The better Baltic and Black Sea coasts, the  fertility of its Ukraine soil, and location next to wide-awake Germany  along the western frontier have helped to accelerate progress, but the  slow-moving body carried too heavy a drag.    [Sidenote: Land and sea in co-operation.]    The law of the resolutions of forces applies in geography as in the  movement of planets. Failure to recognize this fact often enables  superficial critics of anthropo-geography to make a brave show of  argument. The analysis of these interacting forces and of their various  combinations requires careful investigation. Let us consider the  interplay of the forces of land and sea apparent in every country with  a maritime location. In some cases a small, infertile, niggardly country  conspires with a beckoning sea to drive its sons out upon the deep; in  others a wide territory with a generous soil keeps its well-fed children  at home and silences the call of the sea. In ancient Phoenicia and  Greece, in Norway, Finland, New England, in savage Chile and Tierra del  Fuego, and the Indian coast district of British Columbia and southern  Alaska, a long, broken shoreline, numerous harbors, outlying islands,  abundant timber for the construction of ships, difficult communication  by land, all tempted the inhabitants to a seafaring life. While the sea  drew, the land drove in the same direction. There a hilly or mountainous  interior putting obstacles in the way of landward expansion, sterile  slopes, a paucity of level, arable land, an excessive or deficient  rainfall withholding from agriculture the reward of tillage--some or all  of these factors combined to compel the inhabitants to seek on the sea  the livelihood denied by the land. Here both forces worked in the same  direction.    In England conditions were much the same, and from the sixteenth century  produced there a predominant maritime development which was due not  solely to a long indented coastline and an exceptional location for  participating in European and American trade. Its limited island area,  its large extent of rugged hills and chalky soil fit only for pasturage,  and the lack of a really generous natural endowment,[12] made it slow to  answer the demands of a growing population, till the industrial  development of the nineteenth century exploited its mineral wealth. So  the English turned to the sea--to fish, to trade, to colonize. Holland's  conditions made for the same development. She united advantages of  coastline and position with a small infertile territory, consisting  chiefly of water-soaked grazing lands. When at the zenith of her  maritime development, a native authority estimated that the soil of  Holland could not support more than one-eighth of her inhabitants. The  meager products of the land had to be eked out by the harvest of the  sea. Fish assumed an important place in the diet of the Dutch, and when  a process of curing it was discovered, laid the foundation of Holland's  export trade. A geographical location central to the Baltic and North  Sea countries, and accessible to France and Portugal, combined with a  position at the mouth of the great German rivers made it absorb the  carrying trade of northern Europe.[13] Land and sea cooeperated in its  maritime development.    [Sidenote: Land and sea opposed.]    Often the forces of land and sea are directly opposed. If a country's  geographic conditions are favorable to agriculture and offer room for  growth of population, the land forces prevail, because man is primarily  a terrestrial animal. Such a country illustrates what Chisholm, with  Attic nicety of speech, calls \"the influence of bread-power on  history,\"[14] as opposed to Mahan's sea-power. France, like England, had  a long coastline, abundant harbors, and an excellent location for  maritime supremacy and colonial expansion; but her larger area and  greater amount of fertile soil put off the hour of a redundant  population such as England suffered from even in Henry VIII's time.  Moreover, in consequence of steady continental expansion from the  twelfth to the eighteenth century and a political unification which made  its area more effective for the support of the people, the French of  Richelieu's time, except those from certain districts, took to the sea,  not by national impulse as did the English and Dutch, but rather under  the spur of government initiative. They therefore achieved far less in  maritime trade and colonization.[15] In ancient Palestine, a long  stretch of coast, poorly equipped with harbors but accessible to the  rich Mediterranean trade, failed to offset the attraction of the gardens  and orchards of the Jezreel Valley and the pastures of the Judean hills,  or to overcome the land-born predilections and aptitudes of the  desert-bred Jews. Similarly, the river-fringed peninsulas of Virginia  and Maryland, opening wide their doors to the incoming sea, were  powerless, nevertheless, to draw the settlers away from the riotous  productiveness of the wide tidewater plains. Here again the geographic  force of the land outweighed that of the sea and became the dominant  factor in directing the activities of the inhabitants.    The two antagonistic geographic forces may be both of the land, one born  of a country's topography, the other of its "]]]
