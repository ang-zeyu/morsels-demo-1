VI.    [Page heading: DOMENICO VENEZIANO]    To distinguish clearly, after the lapse of nearly five centuries,  between Uccello and Castagno, and to determine the precise share each  had in the formation of the Florentine school, is already a task fraught  with difficulties. The scantiness of his remaining works makes it more  than difficult, makes it almost impossible, to come to accurate  conclusions regarding the character and influence of their somewhat  younger contemporary, Domenico Veneziano. That he was an innovator in  technique, in affairs of vehicle and medium, we know from Vasari; but as  such innovations, indispensable though they may become to painting as a  craft, are in themselves questions of theoretic and applied chemistry,  and not of art, they do not here concern us. His artistic achievements  seem to have consisted in giving to the figure movement and expression,  and to the face individuality. In his existing works we find no trace of  sacrifice made to dexterity and naturalism, although it is clear that he  must have been master of whatever science and whatever craft were  prevalent in his day. Otherwise he would not have been able to render a  figure like the St. Francis in his Uffizi altar-piece, where tactile  values and movement expressive of character--what we usually call  individual _gait_--were perhaps for the first time combined; or to  attain to such triumphs as his St. John and St. Francis, at Santa Croce,  whose entire figures express as much fervour as their eloquent faces.  As to his sense for the significant in the individual, in other words,  his power as a portrait-painter, we have in the Pitti one or two heads  to witness, perhaps, the first great achievements in this kind of the  Renaissance.    [Page heading: FRA FILIPPO LIPPI]    No such difficulties as we have encountered in the study of Uccello,  Castagno, and Veneziano meet us as we turn to Fra Filippo. His works are  still copious, and many of them are admirably preserved; we therefore  have every facility for judging him as an artist, yet nothing is harder  than to appreciate him at his due. If attractiveness, and attractiveness  of the best kind, sufficed to make a great artist, then Filippo would be  one of the greatest, greater perhaps than any other Florentine before  Leonardo. Where shall we find faces more winsome, more appealing, than  in certain of his Madonnas--the one in the Uffizi, for instance--more  momentarily evocative of noble feeling than in his Louvre altar-piece?  Where in Florentine painting is there anything more fascinating than the  playfulness of his children, more poetic than one or two of his  landscapes, more charming than is at times his colour? And with all  this, health, even robustness, and almost unfailing good-humour! Yet by  themselves all these qualities constitute only a high-class illustrator,  and such by native endowment I believe Fra Filippo to have been. That he  became more--very much more--is due rather to Masaccio's potent  influence than to his own genius; for he had no profound sense of either  material or spiritual significance--the essential qualifications of the  real artist. Working under the inspiration of Masaccio, he at times  renders tactile values admirably, as in the Uffizi Madonna--but most  frequently he betrays no genuine feeling for them, failing in his  attempt to render them by the introduction of bunchy, billowy,  calligraphic draperies. These, acquired from the late Giottesque painter  (probably Lorenzo Monaco) who had been his first master, he seems to  have prized as artistic elements no less than the tactile values which  he attempted to adopt later, serenely unconscious, apparently, of their  incompatibility. Filippo's strongest impulse was not toward the  pre-eminently artistic one of re-creation, but rather toward expression,  and within that field, toward the expression of the pleasant, genial,  spiritually comfortable feelings of ordinary life. His real place is  with the _genre_ painters; only his _genre_ was of the soul, as that of  others--of Benozzo Gozzoli, for example--was of the body. Hence a sin of  his own, scarcely less pernicious than that of the naturalists, and  cloying to boot--expression at any cost.      VII.    [Page heading: NATURALISM IN FLORENTINE ART]    From the brief account just given of the four dominant personalities in  Florentine painting from about 1430 to about 1460, it results that the  leanings of the school during this interval were not artistic and  artistic alone, but that there were other tendencies as well, tendencies  on the one side, toward the expression of emotion (scarcely less  literary because in form and colour than if in words), and, on the  other, toward the naturalistic reproduction of objects. We have also  noted that while the former tendency was represented by Filippo alone,  the latter had Paolo Uccello, and all of Castagno and Veneziano that the  genius of these two men would permit them to sacrifice to naturalism  and science. To the extent, however, that they took sides and were  conscious of a distinct purpose, these also sided with Uccello and not  with Filippo. It may be agreed, therefore, that the main current of  Florentine painting for a generation after Masaccio was naturalistic,  and that consequently the impact given to the younger painters who  during this period were starting, was mainly toward naturalism. Later,  in studying Botticelli, we shall see how difficult it was for any one  young at the time to escape this tide, even if by temperament farthest  removed from scientific interests.    Meanwhile we must continue our study of the naturalists, but now of the  second generation. Their number and importance from 1460 to 1490 is not  alone due to the fact that art education toward the beginning of this  epoch was mainly naturalistic, but also to the real needs of a rapidly  advancing craft, and even more to the character of the Florentine mind,  the dominant turn of which was to science and not to art. But as there  were then no professions scientific in the stricter sense of the word,  and as art of some form was the pursuit of a considerable proportion of  the male inhabitants of Florence, it happened inevitably that many a lad  with the natural capacities of a Galileo was in early boyhood  apprenticed as an artist. And as he never acquired ordinary methods of  scientific expression, and never had time for occupations not  bread-winning, he was obliged his life long to make of his art both the  subject of his strong instinctive interest in science, and the vehicle  of conveying his knowledge to others.    [Page heading: ALESSIO BALDOVINETTI]    This was literally the case with the oldest among the leaders of the new  generation, Alessio Baldovinetti, in whose scanty remaining works no  trace of purely artistic feeling or interest can be discerned; and it is  only less true of Alessio's somewhat younger, but far more gifted  contemporaries, Antonio Pollaiuolo and Andrea Verrocchio. These also we  should scarcely suspect of being more than men of science, if Pollaiuolo  once or twice, and Verrocchio more frequently, did not dazzle us with  works of almost supreme art, which, but for our readiness to believe in  the manifold possibilities of Florentine genius, we should with  exceeding difficulty accept as their creation--so little do they seem to  result from their conscious striving. Alessio's attention being largely  devoted to problems of vehicle--to the side of painting which is  scarcely superior to cookery--he had time for little else, although that  spare time he gave to the study of landscape, in the rendering of which  he was among the innovators. Andrea and Antonio set themselves the much  worthier task of increasing on every side the effectiveness of the  figure arts, of which, sculpture no less than painting, they aimed to be  masters.    [Page heading: POLLAIUOLO AND VERROCCHIO]    To confine ourselves, however, as closely as we may to painting, and  leaving aside for the present the question of colour, which, as I have  already said, is, in Florentine art, of entirely subordinate importance,  there were three directions in which painting as Pollaiuolo and  Verrocchio found it had greatly to advance before it could attain its  maximum of effectiveness: landscape, movement, and the nude. Giotto had  attempted none of these. The nude, of course, he scarcely touched;  movement he suggested admirably, but never rendered; and in landscape  he was satisfied with indications hardly more than symbolical, although  quite adequate to his purpose, which was to confine himself to the human  figure. In all directions Masaccio made immense progress, guided by his  never failing sense for material significance, which, as it led him to  render the tactile values of each figure separately, compelled him also  to render the tactile values of groups as wholes, and of their landscape  surroundings--by preference, hills so shaped as readily to stimulate the  tactile imagination. For what he accomplished in the nude and in  movement, we have his \"Expulsion\" and his \"Man Trembling with Cold\" to  witness. But in his works neither landscape nor movement, nor the nude,  are as yet distinct sources of artistic pleasure--that is to say, in  themselves life-enhancing. Although we can well leave the nude until we  come to Michelangelo, who was the first to completely realise its  distinctly artistic possibilities, we cannot so well dispense with an  enquiry into the sources of our aesthetic pleasure in the representation  of movement and of landscape, as it was in these two directions--in  movement by Pollaiuolo especially,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17412"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins (#6)"],[1," so he  won't want me for a while.\"    \"Very well, Nan, you may stay with them. But all of you be careful,\"  said Mrs. Bobbsey.    After that the building of the snow house was started all over again.  The pile of snow was packed down as hard as possible, and Nan made  Flossie and Freddie do the outside work while she crept inside, and cut  around the ceiling and the bay window just as the others wanted. It was  great sport, and when the snow house was finished it was large enough  and strong enough for all of them to enter with safety.    \"To-night I'll poah some water ober dat house,\" said Sam. \"Dat will make  de snow as hard as ice.\" This was done, and the house remained in the  garden until spring came. Later on Bert built an addition to it, which  he called the library, and in this he put a bench and a shelf on which  he placed some old magazines and story papers. In the main part of the  snow house Freddie and Flossie at first placed an old rug and two blocks  of wood for chairs, and a small bench for a table. Then, when Flossie  grew tired of the house, Freddie turned it into a stable, in which he  placed his rocking-horse. Then he brought out his iron fire engine, and  used the place for a fire-house, tying an old dinner bell on a stick,  stuck over the doorway. _Dong! dong!_ would go the bell, and out he  would rush with his little engine and up the garden path, looking for a  fire.    \"Let us play you are a reg'lar fireman,\" said Flossie, on seeing this.  \"You must live in the fire-house, and I must be your wife and come to  see you with the baby.\" And she dressed up in a long skirt and paid him  a visit, with her best doll on her arm. Freddie pretended to be very  glad to see her, and embraced the baby. But a moment later he made the  bell ring, and throwing the baby to her rushed off again with his  engine.    \"That wasn't very nice,\" pouted Flossie. \"Dorothy might have fallen in  the snow.\"    \"Can't help it,\" answered Freddie. \"A fireman can't stop for anything.\"    \"But--but--he doesn't have to throw his baby away, does he?\" questioned  Flossie, with wide open eyes.    \"Yes, he does,--_ev'rything_.\"    \"But--but supposing he is--is eating his dinner?\"    \"He has to throw it away, Flossie. Oh, it's awful hard to be a real  fireman.\"    \"Would he have to throw his jam away, and his pie?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then I wouldn't be a fireman, not for a--a house full of gold!\" said  Flossie, and marched back into the house with her doll.    Flossie's dolls were five in number. Dorothy was her pride, and had  light hair and blue eyes, and three dresses, one of real lace. The next  was Gertrude, a short doll with black eyes and hair and a traveling  dress that was very cute. Then came Lucy, who had lost one arm, and  Polly, who had lost both an arm and a leg. The fifth doll was Jujube, a  colored boy, dressed in a fiery suit of red, with a blue cap and real  rubber boots. This doll had come from Sam and Dinah and had been much  admired at first, but was now taken out only when all the others went  too.    \"He doesn't really belong to the family, you know,\" Flossie would  explain to her friends. \"But I have to keep him, for mamma says there is  no colored orphan asylum for dolls. Besides, I don't think Sam and Dinah  would like to see their doll child in an asylum.\" The dolls were all  kept in a row in a big bureau drawer at the top of the house, but  Flossie always took pains to separate Jujube from the rest by placing  the cover of a pasteboard box between them.    With so much snow on the ground it was decided by the boys of that  neighborhood to build a snow fort, and this work was undertaken early on  the following Saturday morning. Luckily, Bert was by that time well  enough to go out and he did his fair share of the labor, although being  careful not to injure the sore ankle.    The fort was built at the top of a small hill in a large open lot. It  was made about twenty feet square and the wall was as high as the boys'  heads and over a foot thick. In the middle was gathered a big pile of  snow, and into this was stuck a flag-pole from which floated a nice flag  loaned by a boy named Ralph Blake.    \"Let us divide into two parties of soldiers,\" said Ralph. \"One can  defend the fort and the others can attack it.\"    \"Hurrah! just the thing!\" cried Bert. \"When shall the battle begin?\"    The boys talked it over, and it was decided to have the battle come off  after lunch.    The boys went home full of enthusiasm, and soon the news spread that a  real soldiers' battle was to take place at the lot.    \"Oh, Bert, can't I go and look on?\" asked Nan.    \"I want to go, too,\" put in Flossie.    \"Can't I be a soldier?\" asked Freddie. \"I can make snowballs, and throw  'em, too.\"    \"No, Freddie, you are too little to be a soldier,\" answered Bert. \"But  you can all come and look on, if you wish.\"    After lunch the boys began to gather quickly, until over twenty were  present. Many girls and a few grown folks were also there, who took  places out of harm's way.    \"Now, remember,\" said a gentleman who was placed in charge. \"No icy  snowballs and no stones.\"    \"We'll remember, Mr. Potter,\" cried the young soldiers.    The boys were speedily divided into two parties, one to attack and one  to defend the fort. It fell to Bert's lot to be one of the attacking  party. Without loss of time each party began to make all the snowballs  it could. The boys who remained in the fort kept out of sight behind the  walls, while the attacking party moved to the back of the barn at the  corner of the big lot.    \"Are you all ready?\" shouted Mr. Potter presently.    A yell of assent came from nearly all of the young soldiers.    \"Very well, then; the battle may begin.\"    Some of the boys had brought horns along, and now a rousing blast came  from behind the barn and then from the snow fort.    \"Come on and capture the fort!\" cried Bert, and led the way, with his  arms full of snowballs.    There was a grand cheer and up the hill rushed the young soldiers, ready  to capture the snow fort no matter what the cost.          CHAPTER VIII    FUN ON THE ICE      \"Oh, the fight is going to start!\" cried Nan, in high excitement. \"See  them coming up the hill!\"    \"Will they shoot?\" asked Flossie, just a bit nervously.    \"Course they won't shoot,\" answered Freddie. \"Can't shoot snowballs.  Ain't got no powder in.\"    The attacking party was still a good distance from the fort when those  inside let fly a volley of snowballs. But the snowballs did not reach  their mark, and still the others came up the hill.    \"Now then, give it to them!\" cried Bert, and let fly his first snowball,  which landed on the top of the fort's wall. Soon the air was full of  snowballs, flying one way and another. Many failed to do any damage, but  some went true, and soon Bert received a snowball full in the breast  and another in the shoulder. Then he slipped and fell and his own  snowballs were lost.    The attacking party got to within fifty feet of the fort, but then the  ammunition gave out and they were forced to retreat, which they did in  quick order.    \"Hurrah! they can't take the fort!\" cried those inside of the  stronghold, and blew their horns more wildly than ever. But their own  ammunition was low and they made other snowballs as quickly as they  could, using the pile of snow in the middle of the fort for that  purpose.    Back of the barn the attacking party held a consultation.    \"I've got a plan,\" said a boy named Ned Brown. \"Let us divide into two  parties and one move on the fort from the front and the other from the  back. Then, if they attack one party, the other party can sneak in and  climb over the fort wall and capture the flag.\"    \"All right, let us do that,\" said Bert.    Waiting until each boy had a dozen or more snowballs, half of the  attacking force moved away along a fence until the rear of the fort was  gained. Then, with another cheer, all set out for the fort.    It was a grand rush and soon the air was once more filled with  snowballs, much to the delight of the spectators, who began to cheer  both sides.    \"Oh, I hope they get into the fort this time,\" said Nan.    \"I hope they don't,\" answered another girl, who had a brother in the  fort.    Inside the fort the boys were having rather a hard time of it. They were  close together, and a snowball coming over the walls was almost certain  to hit one or another. More than this, the pile of snow around the flag  was growing small, so that the flag was in great danger of toppling  over.    Up the two sides of the hill came the invaders, Bert leading the  detachment that was to attack the rear. He was hit again, but did not  falter, and a moment later found himself at the very wall.    \"Get back there!\" roared a boy from the fort and threw a large lump of  soft snow directly into his face. But Bert threw the lump back and the  boy slipped and fell flat. Then, amid a perfect shower of snowballs,  Bert and two other boys fairly tumbled into the fort.    \"Defend the flag! Defend the flag!\" was the rallying cry of the fort  defenders, and they gathered around the flag. The struggle was now a  hand-to-hand one, in which nothing but soft snow was used, and nearly  every boy had his face washed.    \"Get back there!\" roared Danny Rugg, who was close to the flag, but as  he spoke two boys shoved him down on his face in the snow, and the next  moment Bert and another boy of the invading party had the flag and was  carrying it away in triumph.    \"The fort has fallen!\" screamed Nan, and clapped her hands.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Freddie. \"The--the forters are beaten, aren't they?\"    \"Yes, Freddie.\"    A cheer was given for those who had captured the fort. Then some of the  boys began to dance on the top of the walls, and down they came, one  after another, until the fort was in ruins, and the great contest came  to an end.    \"It was just splendid!\" said Nan to Bert, on the way home. \"Just"]]]
