Each of these people was, in some measure, different from the others.  Our inheritance comes from all of them and from each of them.    How do all of these diverse characteristics work out in the child? In  the first place, it seems evident that we do not inherit our bodies as  wholes, but in parts or units. We may think of the human race as a whole  being made up of a great number of unit characters. No one person  possesses all of them. Every person is lacking in some of them. His  neighbor may be lacking in quite different ones. Now one parent  transmits to the child a certain combination of unit characters; the  other parent, a different combination. These characteristics may not all  appear in the child, but all are transmitted through it to the next  generation, and they are transmitted purely. By being transmitted  purely, we mean that the characteristic does not seem to lose its  identity and disappear in fusions or mixtures. The essential point in  this doctrine of heredity is known as Mendelism; it is the principle of  inheritance through the pure transmission of unit characters.    An illustration will probably make the Mendelian principle clear. Let us  select our illustration from the plant world. It is found that if white  and yellow corn are crossed, all the corn the first year, resulting from  this crossing, will be yellow. Now, if this hybrid yellow corn is  planted the second year, and freely cross-fertilized, it turns out that  one fourth of it will be white and three fourths yellow. But this yellow  consists of three parts: one part being pure yellow which will breed  true, producing nothing but yellow; the other two parts transmit white  and yellow in equal ratio. That is to say, these two parts are hybrids,  the result of crossing white with yellow. It is not meant that one can  actually distinguish these two kinds of yellow, the pure yellow and the  hybrid yellow, but the results from planting it show that one third of  the yellow is pure and that the other two thirds transmit white and  yellow in equal ratio.    The main point to notice in all this is that when two individuals having  diverse characteristics are crossed, the characteristics do not fuse and  disappear ultimately, but that the two characteristics are transmitted  in equal ratio, and each will appear in succeeding generations, and will  appear pure, just as if it had not been crossed with something  different. The first offspring resulting from the cross--known as  hybrids--may show either one or the other of the diverse  characteristics, or, when such a thing is possible, even a blending of  the two characteristics. But whatever the actual appearance of the first  generation of offspring resulting from crossing parents having diverse  characteristics, their germ-cells transmit the diverse characteristics  in equal proportion, as explained above.    When one of the diverse characteristics appears in the first generation  of offspring and the other does not appear, or is not apparent, the one  that appears is said to be _dominant_, while the one not appearing is  said to be _recessive_. In our example of the yellow and white corn,  yellow is dominant and white recessive. And it must be remembered that  the white corn that appears in the second generation will breed true  just as if it had never been crossed with the yellow corn. One third of  the yellow of the second generation would also breed true if it could be  separated from the other two thirds.    It is not here claimed that Mendelism is a universal principle, that all  characteristics are transmitted in this way. However, the results of the  numerous experiments in heredity lead one to expect this to be the case.  Most of the experiments have been with lower animals and with plants,  but recent experiments and statistical studies show that Mendelism is an  important factor in human heredity, in such characteristics as color of  hair and eyes and skin, partial color blindness, defects of eye, ear,  and other important organs.    The studies that have been made of human heredity have been, for the  most part, studies of the transmission of physical characteristics. Very  little has been done that bears directly upon the transmission of mental  characteristics. But our knowledge of the dependence of mind upon body  should prepare us to infer mental heredity from physical heredity. Such  studies as throw light on the question bear us out in making such an  inference.    The studies that have been more directly concerned with mental heredity  are those dealing with the resemblances of twins, studies of heredity in  royalty, studies of the inheritance of genius, and studies of the  transmission of mental defects and defects of sense organs. The results  of all these studies indicate the inheritance of mental characteristics  in the same way that physical characteristics are transmitted. Not only  are human mental characteristics transmitted from parent to offspring,  but they seem to be transmitted in Mendelian fashion.    Feeble-mindedness, for example, seems to be a Mendelian character and  recessive. From the studies that have been made, it seems that two  congenitally feeble-minded parents will have only feeble-minded  children. Feeble-mindedness acts in heredity as does the white corn in  the example given above. If one parent only is feeble-minded, the other  being normal, all of the children will be normal, just as all of the  corn, in the first generation after the crossing, was yellow. But these  children whose parents are the one normal and the other feeble-minded,  while themselves normal, transmit feeble-mindedness in equal ratio with  normality. It works out as follows: If a feeble-minded person marry a  person of sound mind and sound stock, the children will all be of sound,  normal mind. If these children take as husbands and wives men and women  who had for parents one normal and one feeble-minded person, their  children will be one fourth feeble-minded and three fourths of them  normal.    To summarize the various conditions: If a feeble-minded person marry a  feeble-minded person, all the children will be feeble-minded. If a  feeble-minded person marry a sound, normal person (pure stock), all the  children will be normal. If the children, in the last case, marry others  like themselves as to origin, one fourth of their offspring will be  feeble-minded. If such hybrid children marry feeble-minded persons, one  half of the offspring will be feeble-minded. It is rash to prophesy, but  future studies of heredity may show that Mendelism, or some  modification of the principle, always holds true of mind as well as of  body.    Little can be said about the transmission of particular definite mental  traits, such as the various aspects of memory, association, attention,  temperament, etc. Before we can speak with any certainty here, we must  make very careful experimental studies of these mental traits in parents  and offspring. No such work has been done. All we have at the present  time is the result of general observation.    =Improvement of the Race.= Eugenics is the science of improvement of the  human race by breeding. While we can train children and thereby make  them much better than they would be without such training, this training  does not improve the stock. The improvement of the stock can be  accomplished only through breeding from the best and preventing the poor  stock from leaving offspring. This is a well-known principle in the  breeding of domestic animals.    It is doubtless just as true in the case of human beings. The hygienic  and scientific rearing of children is good for the children and makes  their lives better, but probably does not affect their offspring. We  should not forget that all the social and educational influences die  with the generation that receives them. They must be impressed by  training on the next generation or that generation will receive no  influence from them. The characters which we acquire in our lifetime  seem not to be transmitted to our children, except through what is known  as social heredity, which is merely the taking on of characteristics  through imitation. Our children must go through all the labor of  learning to read, write, spell, add, multiply, subtract, and divide,  which we went through. Moral traits, manners and customs, and other  habits and ideals of social importance must be acquired by each  successive generation.    =Heredity _versus_ Environment.= The question is often asked whether  heredity or the influence of environment has the most to do with the  final outcome of one's life. It is a rather useless question to ask, for  what a human being or anything else in the world does depends upon what  it is itself and what the things and forces are that act upon it.  Heredity sets a limitation for us, fixes the possibilities. The  circumstances of life determine what we will do with our inherited  abilities and characteristics. Hereditary influences incline us to be  tall or short, fat or lean, light or dark. The characteristics of our  memory, association, imagination, our learning capacity, etc., are  determined by heredity. Of course, how far these various aspects develop  is to some extent dependent upon the favorable or unfavorable influences  of the environment. What is possible for us to do is settled by  heredity; what we may actually do, what we may have the opportunity to  do, is largely a matter of the circumstances of life.    In certain parts of New England, the number of men who become famous in  art, science, or literature is very great compared to the number in some  other parts of our country. As far as we have any evidence, the native  stocks are the same in the two cases, but in New England the influences  turn men into the direction of science, art, and literature.

Dixon    PHIL TOWNS  OLD SLAVE STORY  [Date Stamp: -- 8 1937]    [TR: This interview contained many handwritten edits; where text was  transposed, meaning was significantly changed, or the edit could not be  clearly read, it has been noted.]      On June 25, 1824, a son was born to Washington and Clara Towns who  resided in Richmond, Virginia. This was the fourth child in a family  which finally numbered thirteen. Phil, as he was called, does not recall  many incidents on this estate as the family moved when he was in his  teens. His grandfather and grandmother were brought here from Africa and  their description of the cruel treatment they received is his most vivid  recollection. His grandmother, Hannah, lived to be 129 years of age.    Mr. George Towns, called \"Governor\" by all of his slaves as well as his  intimate friends, moved to Georgia and settled at Reynolds in Taylor  County. Here he purchased a huge tract of land--1350 acres--and built  his new home upon this level area on the Flint River. The \"big house,\" a  large unpainted structure which housed a family of eighteen, was in the  midst of a grove of trees near the highway that formed one of the  divisions of the plantation. It was again divided by a local railway  nearly a mile from the rear of the house. Eighty-eight slaves were  housed in the \"quarters\" which were on each side of the highway a little  below the planter's home.    These \"quarters\" differed from those found in the surrounding territory  as the size of the houses varied with the number in the family. The  interiors were nicely furnished and in most instances the families were  able to secure any furniture they desired. Feather mattresses, trundle  beds and cribs were common and in families where there were many  children, large fireplaces--some as many as eight feet wide--were  provided so that every one might be [TR: 'able to keep' crossed out]  comfortable in winter. A variety of cooking utensils were given and  large numbers of waffle irons, etc., then considered luxuries, were  found here.    To consider only the general plan of operation, this plantation was no  different from the average one in pre-civil war days but there was a  phase of the life here which made it a most unusual home. \"Governor\" was  so exceptionally kind to his slaves that they were known as \"Gov. Towns'  free negroes\" to those on the neighboring farms. He never separated  families, neither did he strike a slave except on rare occasions. Two  things which might provoke his anger to this extent, were: to be told a  lie, and to find that a person had allowed some one to take advantage of  him. They were never given passes but obtained verbal consent to go  where they wished and always remained as long as they chose.    Phil Towns' father worked in the field and his mother did light work in  the house, such as assisting in spinning. Mothers of three or more  children were not compelled to work, as the master felt that their  children needed care. From early childhood boys and girls were given  excellent training. A boy who robbed a bird's nest or a girl who  frolicked in a boisterous manner was severely reprimanded. Separate  bedrooms for the two sexes were maintained until they married. The girls  passed thru two stages--childhood, and at sixteen they became \"gals\".  Three years later they might marry if they chose but the husband had to  be older--at least 21. Courtships differed from those of today because  there were certain hours for visiting and even though the girl might  accompany her sweetheart away from home she had to be back at that hour.  They had no clocks but a \"time mark\" was set by the sun. A young man was  not allowed to give his girl any form of gift, and the efforts of some  girls to secretly receive gifts which they claimed to have \"found\", were  in vain, for these were taken from them. After the proposal, the  procedure was practically the same as is observed today. The consent of  the parent and the master was necessary. Marriages were mostly held at  night and no pains were spared to make them occasions to be remembered  and cherished. Beautiful clothes--her own selections--were given the  bride, and friends usually gave gifts for the house. These celebrations,  attended by visitors from many plantations, and always by the Towns  family, ended in gay \"frolics\" with cakes, wine, etc., for refreshments.    During the first year of married life the couple remained with the  bride's mother who instructed her in the household arts. Disputes  between the newlyweds were not tolerated and punishment by the parents  was the result of \"nagging\". At the end of a year, another log cabin was  added to the quarters and the couple began housekeeping. The moral code  was exceedingly high; the penalty for offenders--married or single,  white or colored--was to be banished from the group entirely. Thus  illegitimate children were rare enough to be a novelty.    Young Phil was in his teens when he began his first job--coach driver  for \"Gov.\" Towns. This was just before they moved to Georgia. He  traveled with him wherever he went, and as the Gov. purchased a  plantation in Talbot County, (the house still stands), and a home in  Macon, (the site of Mt. De Sales Academy), a great deal of his time was  spent on the road. Phil never did any other work except to occasionally  assist in sweeping the large yard. The other members of this group split  rails, did field work, spinning, tailoring and any of the many things  that had to be done. Each person might choose the type of work he liked  best.    Opportunities to make cash money were plentiful. Some made baskets and  did hand work which was sold and the money given the maker. A man or  woman who paid Gov. Towns $150.00 might hire himself to the Gov. for a  year. When this was done he was paid cash for all the work he did and  many were able to clear several hundred dollars in a year. In addition  to this opportunity for earning money, every adult had an acre of ground  which he might cultivate as he chose. Any money made from the sale of  this produce was his own.    Recreation was not considered important so no provision was made in the  regular routine. It was, however, possible to obtain \"time off\" at  frequent intervals and these might be termed irregular vacation periods.  Evening entertainment at which square dancing was the main attraction,  were common. Quill music, from a homemade harmonica, was played when  banjoes were not available. These instruments were made by binding with  cane five to ten reeds of graduated lengths. A hole was cut in the upper  end of each and the music obtained by blowing up and down the scale.  Guests came from all neighboring farms and engaged in the \"Green Corn\"  dance which was similar to what is now called Buck dancing. Near the end  of such a hilarious evening, the guests were served with persimmon beer  and ginger cakes,--then considered delicacies.    \"Gov.\" Towns was interested in assisting any one [HW: wanting to learn].  [TR: Original reads 'desirous of learning.'] The little girls who  expressed the desire to become \"ladies\" were kept in the \"big house\" and  very carefully trained. The tastes of these few were developed to the  extent that they excelled the ordinary \"quarter\" children and were the  envy of the group at social affairs.    Sunday was a day of Reverence and all adults were required to attend  religious services. The trip was usually made in wagons, oxcarts, etc.,  although the young women of the big house rode handsome saddle horses.  At each church there was placed a stepping block by which they descended  from their steeds. White and colored worshipped at the same church,  constructed with a partition separating the two parts of the  congregation but not extending to the pulpit. Professions of faith were  accepted at the same altar while Baptismal services ware held at a local  creek and all candidates were baptized on the same day. Regular clothing  was worn at this service. Children were not allowed to attend church,  and christenings were not common. Small boys, reared entirely apart from  strict religious observances, used to slip away and shoot marbles on  Sunday.    The health problem was not acute as these people were provided with  everything necessary for a contented mind and a robust body. [TR:  original line: The health problem was not a very acute one as these  people were provided with everything conducive to a contented mind which  plays a large part in maintaining a robust body.] However, a Doctor who  lived nearby cared for the sick. Two fees were set--the larger one being  charged if the patient recovered. Home remedies were used for minor  ills--catnip tea for thrash, tea from Samson Snakeroot for cramps,  redwood and dogwood bark tea [HW: and horehound candy] for worms, [HW:  many] root teas used [HW: medicinally] by this generation. Peach brandy  was given to anyone suspected of having pneumonia,--if the patient  coughed, it was certain that he was a victim of the disease.    In these days, a mother named her children by a name [TR: unreadable]  during pregnancy. [TR: original line: In these days, it was always  thought best for the mother to name her children if the proper name for  the babe was theoretically revealed to her during pregnancy.] If another  name was given the child, the correct one would be so firmly implanted  in his subconscious mind that he would never be able to resist the  impulse "]]]
