His wife was of a milder mood: she  was blest with a singular fortitude of temper; was as devout of heart,  as she was calm of mind; and loved, while busied in her household  concerns, to sweeten the bitterer moments of life, by chanting the  songs and ballads of her country, of which her store was great. The  garden and nursery prospered so much, that he was induced to widen his  views, and by the help of his kind landlord, the laird of Doonholm,  and the more questionable aid of borrowed money, he entered upon a  neighbouring farm, named Mount Oliphant, extending to an hundred  acres. This was in 1765; but the land was hungry and sterile; the  seasons proved rainy and rough; the toil was certain, the reward  unsure; when to his sorrow, the laird of Doonholm--a generous  Ferguson,--died: the strict terms of the lease, as well as the rent,  were exacted by a harsh factor, and with his wife and children, he was  obliged, after a losing struggle of six years, to relinquish the farm,  and seek shelter on the grounds of Lochlea, some ten miles off, in the  parish of Tarbolton. When, in after-days, men's characters were in the  hands of his eldest son, the scoundrel factor sat for that lasting  portrait of insolence and wrong, in the \"Twa Dogs.\"    In this new farm William Burns seemed to strike root, and thrive. He  was strong of body and ardent of mind: every day brought increase of  vigour to his three sons, who, though very young, already put their  hands to the plough, the reap-hook, and the flail. But it seemed that  nothing which he undertook was decreed in the end to prosper: after  four seasons of prosperity a change ensued: the farm was far from  cheap; the gains under any lease were then so little, that the loss of  a few pounds was ruinous to a farmer: bad seed and wet seasons had  their usual influence: \"The gloom of hermits and the moil of  galley-slaves,\" as the poet, alluding to those days, said, were  endured to no purpose; when, to crown all, a difference arose between  the landlord and the tenant, as to the terms of the lease; and the  early days of the poet, and the declining years of his father, were  harassed by disputes, in which sensitive minds are sure to suffer.    Amid these labours and disputes, the poet's father remembered the  worth of religious and moral instruction: he took part of this upon  himself. A week-day in Lochlea wore the sober looks of a Sunday: he  read the Bible and explained, as intelligent peasants are accustomed  to do, the sense, when dark or difficult; he loved to discuss the  spiritual meanings, and gaze on the mystical splendours of the  Revelations. He was aided in these labours, first, by the  schoolmaster of Alloway-mill, near the Doon; secondly, by John  Murdoch, student of divinity, who undertook to teach arithmetic,  grammar, French, and Latin, to the boys of Lochlea, and the sons of  five neighboring farmers. Murdoch, who was an enthusiast in learning,  much of a pedant, and such a judge of genius that he thought wit  should always be laughing, and poetry wear an eternal smile, performed  his task well: he found Robert to be quick in apprehension, and not  afraid to study when knowledge was the reward. He taught him to turn  verse into its natural prose order; to supply all the ellipses, and  not to desist till the sense was clear and plain: he also, in their  walks, told him the names of different objects both in Latin and  French; and though his knowledge of these languages never amounted to  much, he approached the grammar of the English tongue, through the  former, which was of material use to him, in his poetic compositions.  Burns was, even in those early days, a sort of enthusiast in all that  concerned the glory of Scotland; he used to fancy himself a soldier of  the days of the Wallace and the Bruce: loved to strut after the  bag-pipe and the drum, and read of the bloody struggles of his country  for freedom and existence, till \"a Scottish prejudice,\" he says, \"was  poured into my veins, which will boil there till the flood-gates of  life are shut in eternal rest.\"    In this mood of mind Burns was unconsciously approaching the land of  poesie. In addition to the histories of the Wallace and the Bruce, he  found, on the shelves of his neighbours, not only whole bodies of  divinity, and sermons without limit, but the works of some of the best  English, as well as Scottish poets, together with songs and ballads  innumerable. On these he loved to pore whenever a moment of leisure  came; nor was verse his sole favourite; he desired to drink knowledge  at any fountain, and Guthrie's Grammar, Dickson on Agriculture,  Addison's Spectator, Locke on the Human Understanding, and Taylor's  Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin, were as welcome to his heart as  Shakspeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, and Young. There is a mystery in  the workings of genius: with these poets in his head and hand, we see  not that he has advanced one step in the way in which he was soon to  walk, \"Highland Mary\" and \"Tam O' Shanter\" sprang from other  inspirations.    Burns lifts up the veil himself, from the studies which made him a  poet. \"In my boyish days,\" he says to Moore, \"I owed much to an old  woman (Jenny Wilson) who resided in the family, remarkable for her  credulity and superstition. She had, I suppose, the largest collection  in the country of tales and songs, concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,  brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles,  dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, enchanted  towers, dragons, and other trumpery. This cultivated the latent seeds  of poesie; but had so strong an effect upon my imagination that to  this hour, in my nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a look-out on  suspicious places.\" Here we have the young poet taking lessons in the  classic lore of his native land: in the school of Janet Wilson he  profited largely; her tales gave a hue, all their own, to many noble  effusions. But her teaching was at the hearth-stone: when he was in  the fields, either driving a cart or walking to labour, he had ever in  his hand a collection of songs, such as any stall in the land could  supply him with; and over these he pored, ballad by ballad, and verse  by verse, noting the true, tender, and the natural sublime from  affectation and fustian. \"To this,\" he said, \"I am convinced that I  owe much of my critic craft, such as it is.\" His mother, too,  unconsciously led him in the ways of the muse: she loved to recite or  sing to him a strange, but clever ballad, called \"the Life and Age of  Man:\" this strain of piety and imagination was in his mind when he  wrote \"Man was made to Mourn.\"    He found other teachers--of a tenderer nature and softer influence.  \"You know,\" he says to Moore, \"our country custom of coupling a man  and woman together as partners in the labours of harvest. In my  fifteenth autumn my partner was a bewitching creature, a year younger  than myself: she was in truth a bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass, and  unwittingly to herself, initiated me in that delicious passion, which,  in spite of acid disappointment, gin-horse prudence, and bookworm  philosophy, I hold to be the first of human joys. How she caught the  contagion I cannot tell; I never expressly said I loved her: indeed I  did not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her,  when returning in the evenings from our labours; why the tones of her  voice made my heart strings thrill like an AEolian harp, and  particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan, when I looked and  fingered over her little hand, to pick out the cruel nettle-stings and  thistles. Among other love-inspiring qualities, she sang sweetly, and  it was her favourite reel to which I attempted to give an embodied  vehicle in rhyme; thus with me began love and verse.\" This intercourse  with the fair part of the creation, was to his slumbering emotions, a  voice from heaven to call them into life and poetry.    From the school of traditionary lore and love, Burns now went to a  rougher academy. Lochlea, though not producing fine crops of corn, was  considered excellent for flax; and while the cultivation of this  commodity was committed to his father and his brother Gilbert, he was  sent to Irvine at Midsummer, 1781, to learn the trade of a  flax-dresser, under one Peacock, kinsman to his mother. Some time  before, he had spent a portion of a summer at a school in Kirkoswald,  learning mensuration and land-surveying, where he had mingled in  scenes of sociality with smugglers, and enjoyed the pleasure of a  silent walk, under the moon, with the young and the beautiful. At  Irvine he laboured by day to acquire a knowledge of his business, and  at night he associated with the gay and the thoughtless, with whom he  learnt to empty his glass, and indulge in free discourse on topics  forbidden at Lochlea. He had one small room for a lodging, for which  he gave a shilling a week: meat he seldom tasted, and his food  consisted chiefly of oatmeal and potatoes sent from his father's  house. In a letter to his father, written with great purity and  simplicity of style, he thus gives a picture of himself, mental and  bodily: \"Honoured Sir, I have purposely delayed writing, in the hope  that I should have the pleasure of seeing you on new years' day, but  work comes so hard upon us that I do not choose to be absent on that  account. My health is nearly the same as when you were here, only my  sleep is a little sounder, and on the whole, I am rather better than  otherwise, though I mend by very slow degrees: the weakness of my  nerves had so debilitated my mind that I dare neither review past  wants nor look forward into futurity, for the least anxiety or  perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole  frame. Sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18505"],[0,"A Popular Schoolgirl (#6)"],[1,"by the side of the packing-case,  much absorbed in the process of exact measurements, when suddenly there  was a rustling and a scrambling noise, and on the wall close to them  appeared a collie dog, growling, snarling, and showing its teeth. Ingred  sprang to her feet in alarm. Wynchcote was so retired that they had  scarcely realized that its garden adjoined the garden of another house.  The collie must have jumped up on to the dividing wall, and, being an  ill-tempered beast, did not use proper discrimination between neighbors  and tramps.    \"Shoo! Get away!\" urged Ingred, with rather shaking knees.    \"Be off, you ill-mannered brute!\" shouted Hereward.    The dog, however, appeared to think the wall was his own special  property, and that it was his business to drive them away from their own  garden. It continued to bark and snarl. Now, as Hereward wished to fix  the rabbit-hutch in exactly the spot over which the creature had mounted  guard, he was naturally much annoyed, and sought for some ready means of  dislodging it from its point of vantage. He did not relish the prospect  of being bitten, so did not want to engage it at close quarters, and no  pole or other weapon lay handy.    Looking hastily round, his eye fell upon the garden-syringe with which  Athelstane sometimes cleaned the motor-bicycle. It had been left, with a  bucket of water, outside the shed. He drew out the piston, filled the  syringe, then discharged its contents straight at the dog. But at that  most unlucky moment a quick change took place on the wall; the collie  retired in favor of his master, and the stream of water charged full  into the astonished countenance of a precise and elderly gentleman from  next door. For a few moments there was a ghastly silence, while he wiped  his face and recovered his dignity. Then he demanded in withering tones:    \"May I ask what is the meaning of this?\"    Ingred and Hereward, overwhelmed with confusion, stuttered out apologies  and explanations. The old gentleman listened with his busy gray eyebrows  knitted and his mouth pursed into a thin line.    \"I shall immediately take steps to ensure that my dog has no further  opportunities of annoying you,\" he remarked stiffly, and took his  departure.    \"Who is he?\" whispered Ingred, as the footsteps on the other side of the  wall shuffled away.    \"His name's Mr. Hardcastle. He's retired, and lives there with a  housekeeper. Great Scot! I've put my foot in it, haven't I? Who'd have  thought he was just going to pop his head up? Dad was going to ask him  to lend us his garden-roller, but it's no use now. I expect I've made an  enemy of him for life!\"    \"I hope he means to keep that savage dog fastened up,\" said Ingred.  \"It's a horrid idea to think that it may, any time, pounce over the wall  at us. It's like having a wolf loose in the garden.\"    As a matter of fact, Mr. Hardcastle kept his word in a way that the  Saxons least anticipated. Instead of chaining the dog, he had a tall  wooden paling erected along the top of the wall, making an effectual  barrier between the two gardens. It was not a beautiful object, and it  cut off the sunshine from a whole long flower-bed; so, though it insured  privacy, it might be regarded as a doubtful benefit for the bungalow.    \"It makes one feel so suburban,\" mourned Quenrede.    \"We shan't be visible, at any rate, when we're digging potatoes,\"  laughed Mrs. Saxon, \"and that's a great point to me, for I'm past the  age that looks fascinating in an overall. If we've Suburbia on one side  of us, we've the open moor on the other, which is something to be  thankful for.\"    \"Yes, until it's sold in building plots,\" sighed Quenrede, who was in a  fit of blues, and unwilling to count up her blessings.          CHAPTER IV    Intruder Bess      Ingred, after a blissful week-end, returned to Grovebury by the early  train on Monday morning, and, wrenching her mind with difficulty from  the interests of Wynch-on-the-Wold, focused it on school affairs  instead. There was certainly need of mental concentration if she meant  to make headway in the College. The standard of work required from  VA. was very stiff, and taxed the powers of even the brightest  girls to the uttermost.    \"Miss Strong reminds me of Rehoboam!\" wailed Fil, fresh from the study  of the Second Book of Chronicles. \"Her little finger's thicker than her  whole body used to be, and, instead of whips, she chastises us with  scorpions. I want to go and bow the knee to Baal.\"    \"Rather mixed up in your Scripture, child, but we understand your  meaning,\" laughed Verity. \"The Bantam's certainly piling it on nowadays  in the way of prep.\"    \"Shows an absolutely brutal lack of consideration,\" agreed Nora.    \"So do all the mistresses,\" groaned Ingred. \"Each of them seems to think  we've nothing to do but her own particular subject. Dr. Linton actually  asked me if I could practise two hours a day. Why, he might as well have  suggested four! I can only get the piano for an hour, even if I wanted  it longer. It's a frightful business at the hostel to cram in all our  practicing, isn't it? I nearly had a free fight with Janie Potter  yesterday. She commandeered the piano, and though I showed her the music  time-table, with my name down for '5 to 6' she wouldn't budge. I had to  tilt her off the stool in the end. It was like a game of musical chairs.  She wouldn't look at me to-day, she's so cross about it. Not that _I_  care in the least!\"    Music was a favorite subject with Ingred, and one in which she excelled.  She would willingly have given more time to it, had the school  curriculum allowed. She was a good reader, and had a sympathetic, if  rather spidery touch. This term she had begun lessons with Dr. Linton,  who was considered the best master in Grovebury. He was organist at the  Abbey Church, and was not only a Doctor of Music, but a composer as  well. His anthems and cantatas were widely known, he conducted the local  choral society and trained the operatic society for the annual  performance. His time was generally very full, so he did not profess to  teach juniors; it was only after celebrating her fifteenth birthday that  Ingred had been eligible as one of his pupils. He had the reputation of  being peppery tempered, therefore she walked into the room to take her  first lesson with her heart performing a sort of jazz dance under her  jersey. Dr. Linton, like many musicians, was of an artistic and  excitable temperament, and highly eccentric. Instead of sitting by the  side of his new pupil, he paced the room, pursing his lips in and out,  and drawing his fingers through his long lank dark hair.    \"Have you brought a piece with you,\" he inquired. \"Then play to me. Oh,  never mind if you make mistakes! That's not the point. I want to know  how you can talk on the piano. What have you got in that folio?  Beethoven? Rachmaninoff? M'Dowell? We'll try the Beethoven. Now don't be  nervous. Just fire away as if you were practising at home!\"    It was all very well, Ingred thought, for Dr. Linton to tell her not to  be nervous, but it was a considerable ordeal to have to perform a test  piece before so keen a critic. In spite of her most valiant efforts her  hands trembled, and wrong chords crept in. She kept bravely at it,  however, and managed to reach the end of the first movement, where she  called a halt.    \"It's not talking--it's only stuttering and stammering on the piano,\"  she apologized.    Dr. Linton laughed. Her remark had evidently pleased him. He always  liked a pupil who fell in with his humor.    \"You've the elements of speech in you, though you're still in the  prattling-baby stage,\" he conceded. \"It's something, at any rate, to  find there's material to work upon. Some people wouldn't make musicians  if they practised for a hundred years. We've got to alter your  touch--your technique's entirely wrong--but if you're content to  concentrate on that, we'll soon show some progress. You'll have to stick  to simple studies this term: no blazing away into M'Dowell and  Rachmaninoff yet awhile.\"    \"I'll do anything you tell me,\" agreed Ingred humbly.    Dr. Linton's manner might be brusque, but he seemed prepared to take an  interest in her work. He was known to give special pains to those whose  artistic caliber appealed to him. In his opinion pupils fell under two  headings: those who had music in them, and those who had not. The  latter, though he might drill them in technique, would never make really  satisfactory pianists; the former, by dint of scolding or cajoling,  according to his mood at the moment, might derive real benefit from his  tuition, and become a credit to him. It was a by-word in the school that  his favorites had the stormiest lessons.    \"I'm thankful I'm not a pet pupil,\" declared Fil, whose playing was  hardly of a classical order. \"I should have forty fits if he stalked  about the room, and tore his hair, and shouted like he does with Janie.  He scared me quite enough sitting by my side and saying: 'Shall we take  this again now?' with a sort of grim politeness, as if he were making an  effort to restrain his temper. I know I'm not what he calls musical, but  I can't help it. I'd rather hear comic opera any day than his wretched  cantatas, and when I'm not practising I shall play what I like. There!\"    And Fil, who was sitting at the piano, twirled round on the stool and  strummed \"Beautiful K--K--Katie\" with a lack of technique that probably  would have brought her teacher's temper up to bubbling-over point had he  been there to listen to her.    It was exactly ten days after the term had begun that Bess Haselford  came to the College. She walked into the Upper Fifth Form room one  Monday morning, looking very shy and lost and strange, and stood  forlornly, not knowing where to sit, till somebody took pity on her, and  pointed to a vacant desk. It happened to be on a line with Ingred's, and  the latter"]]]
