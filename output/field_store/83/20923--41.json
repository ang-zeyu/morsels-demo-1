The pit should be 6 to 10 inches deep, the length and width depending  upon the amount to be stored. It is well to have it wide enough to  accommodate 3 to 5 heads on the bottom row.    In harvesting the heads, pull up by the roots. Break off only the dead  or diseased leaves, and fold the remaining leaves over the head as much  as possible to protect them. Overripe or cracked heads should not be  stored. The heads are placed in the pit with their heads down and roots  up. The second layer is also placed heads down between the roots of the  first layer. It is well not to have more than two layers, on account of  the weight having a tendency to crush the lower layer.    When the cabbages are put in place they are covered with a layer of  earth. When cold weather comes, straw or manure can be added.    Cabbages can often be kept better in pits than in common cellars.--E. F.  McKune, Colorado Agricultural College, Fort Collins, Colorado.          Wintering of Bees.    FRANCIS JAGER, APIARIST, UNIVERSITY FARM, ST. PAUL.      The winter losses of bees in Minnesota are great every year. Bee keepers  can reduce these losses by preparing bees for their winter-quarters.    The chief known cause for winter losses are: Queenlessness, smallness of  number of bees in colonies, insufficient food, improper food, dampness,  bad air, the breaking of the clusters, and low temperature.    More colonies die from lack of food and from cold than from all other  causes. In fact, most of the other causes can be traced to lack of food  and cold.    Queenless colonies will certainly die in a few months.    If the number of bees in a colony is small the clusters cannot generate  enough heat or keep it generated and the bees will perish. To avoid  this, small colonies should be united in the fall into one big colony.    Bees must have food in the winter in order to generate heat. About forty  pounds of honey to the colony should be provided when the bees are put  into winter-quarters. Should the colony be short of honey of its own,  finished frames may be supplied early in the fall or sugar syrup may be  fed. Bee keepers should keep about one well filled extracting frame out  of every seven for feeding purposes.    Dark (not amber) honey is poor food for bees in winter. All black honey  should be removed and combs of white honey should be substituted.  Experiments made by Dr. Phillips, in Washington, D. C., have shown that  bees consume least honey and winter best when the temperature inside the  hive is 57 degrees Fahrenheit.    Dampness in a cellar causes the comb and frames of the hive walls and  cover to get damp and mouldy, and the bees perish from wet and cold  after exhausting their vitality in generating heat.    Bees need fresh air. Foul air will cause excitement, causing an  overheated condition; and the bees will scatter and die. Any excitement  among bees in winter is fatal. Cellars on high ground, covered with  straw over timbers, are best for wintering bees.    If the bee cluster divides or splits up during the winter, the smaller  clusters will perish from cold. The present style of Hoffman frames  divides the bee cluster into eleven divisions separated from each other  by a sheet of wax comb, with no direct communication between different  divisions except over, below or around the frames. If the bee cluster  contracts during the winter on account of cold the divisions of the  outside frames are sometimes left behind and die. Some bee keepers  perforate their frames to keep an easy passage for bees from one  compartment to another. If kept warm, even weak colonies may pass over  or around the frames without much difficulty. When cold, only the  strongest will be able to accomplish this difficult task. Wintering  bees in division hives or in two story hives, which give them a  horizontal bee space through the middle between the two divisions, is  highly recommended for successful wintering.    [Illustration: Francis Jager, Professor of Apiculture, University Farm,  St. Paul.]    In long-continued severe cold the bee clusters will contract into a very  small, compact mass. The tendency of this cluster is to move upward  where the air is warmer. If enough honey is stored above them they will  keep in contact with it. If the honey is stored at the side, the bees  sometimes lose their contact with it and die of starvation and cold.  This is another argument in favor of wintering in two story hives. Often  they will move towards one corner and die there, leaving the other  corners filled with honey. If you must winter in one story hives give  bees plenty of honey in the fall and place the cluster at one side of  the hive so that they move necessarily toward the honey supply.    Bees should be kept in a cellar at a temperature of about 45 degrees.  The difference in the temperature between the outside and the inside of  the hive will be between 10 and 15 degrees. Very strong colonies, no  matter where kept, will keep themselves warm and will survive any degree  of cold, but there is no doubt that their vitality and ability to stand  wintering will suffer a great deal thereby, causing dwindling in the  spring. Cellar wintering is at present general in Minnesota. The bee  cellar should be warm, dry, dark and ventilated. The bees should not be  disturbed during their winter sleep by pounding, jarring, shaking and  feeding. Mice also may cause the bees to get excited and perish. A four  to one inch wire screen in front of the entrance will prevent mice from  getting inside.    The fundamental principles to guide the bee keeper in wintering his bees  are: First, strong colonies, at least six frames covered with bees when  clustered; second, ample store, not less than forty pounds of honey; and  third, a hive with not less than 57 degrees inside temperature. This  temperature may be maintained outside in a double walled hive or in a  hive lined with flax or felt, now manufactured for that purpose, or by  packing the hives in leaves, straw or shavings--or by putting them into  a warm cellar.    Bees in our climate should be put into winter quarters about November 15  and should not be put on their summer stands in the spring until soft  maples are in bloom.    By following these suggestions winter losses may be reduced to an  insignificant percentage, and these mostly from accidents and causes  unforseen, for bees respond wonderfully to proper treatment.          The Currant as a Market Garden Product.    B. WALLNER, JR., WEST ST. PAUL.      The currant is essentially a northern fruit, therefore does well in  Minnesota.    I plant my currants on a clay loam as it retains moisture and coolness,  which the currant prefers. Their roots run somewhat shallow, and hence  sandy or friable soils are not desirable. Soils such as will prevent a  stagnant condition during heavy rainfalls are essential. I plant my  currants early in spring as soon as the frost leaves the ground and a  proper preparation can be secured. I plant them five by five feet apart,  as they require a thorough cultivation the first two years from  planting.    I plant mangels between the rows the first year; second year continued  cultivation is practiced; third year I apply a mulch consisting of  mushroom manure to a depth of from four to six inches, which answers a  double purpose, to keep out weeds and to act as mulch at the same time.  During a prolonged dry spell the soil is moist under this covering, and  it makes it more pleasant for the picking, as it prevents the berries  getting soiled after a rain during the picking season. You cannot  fertilize the currant too abundantly, as it is a gross feeder and  requires plenty of manure to get best results, as such fruit commands  the best price on the market.    I planted my currants on ground previously well fertilized with well  decayed barnyard manure.    I prefer strong well rooted two-year-old plants. The long straggling  roots are shortened, and bruised portions cut off with a sharp knife.  The tops are somewhat reduced, depending on the size of plants. I set  them in a furrow, sufficiently deep to admit the roots to spread out in  a natural position, fill in with surface soil and pack around the roots,  so that when the earth is firmly settled the roots will not protrude out  any place.    In regard to pruning I find the best and largest fruit is produced on  canes not over four years old, and if judicious cutting out of the old  canes is followed nice, large, full clusters of fruit of excellent  character will be obtained. This is a fact that I want to emphasize: if  the market is glutted with currants, you can readily dispose of your  product, providing they are qualified as extra large, which results can  be attained by following these rules.    Pertaining to insects and diseases, I spray my currants twice for the  currant worm with arsenate of lead at the rate of two pounds to fifty  gallons of water.    I also use hellebore (dry powdered form), especially valuable in  destroying the worms when berries are almost ready for market, and on  which it is dangerous to use arsenical poisons. I never was troubled  with the currant worm cane borer. I attribute the absence of this  dreaded insect to my keeping all old wood cut out, which is generally  infested with it.    As to varieties I planted the following: Wilder, Victoria, Prince  Albert, Red Cross, Diploma and White Grape. The Wilder is the best  commercial berry, very productive and large, while the Diploma is one of  the largest fruited varieties in existence, its main drawback consisting  of a straggling habit of growth which requires either tying up the  branches or pruning back somewhat short.    The Prince Albert is late and can be recommended for commercial use.

(Vol. 1,      p. 475.)    The author subsequently shows his preference for the theory of a  migration of the race of the Mound-Builders from southern regions as  being on the whole more probable. Wilson does not, however, content  himself with the evidence afforded by the birds and animals which have  just been discussed, but strengthens his argument by extending the list  of supposed exotic forms known to the Mound-Builders in the following  words (vol. 1, p. 477):         But we must account by other means for the discovery of accurate       miniature representations of it (_i.e._ the Manatee) among the       sculptures of the far-inland mounds of Ohio; and the same remark       equally applies to the jaguar or panther, the cougar, the toucan;       to the buzzard possibly, and also to the paroquet. _The majority of       these animals are not known in the United States; some of them are       totally unknown to within any part of the North American       continent._ (Italics of the present writer.) Others may be classed       with the paroquet, which, though essentially a southern bird, and       common in the Gulf, does occasionally make its appearance inland;       and might possibly become known to the untraveled Mound-Builder       among the fauna of his own northern home.    The information contained in the above paragraph relative to the range  of some of the animals mentioned may well be viewed with surprise by  naturalists. To begin with, the jaguar or panther, by which vernacular  names the _Felis onca_ is presumably meant, is not only found in  Northern Mexico, but extends its range into the United States and  appears as far north as the Red River of Louisiana. (See Baird's Mammals  of North America.) Hence a sculptured representation of this animal in  the mounds, although by no means likely, is not entirely out of the  question. However, among the several carvings of the cat family that  have been exhumed from the mounds and made known there is not one which  can, with even a fair degree of probability, be identified as this  species in distinction from the next animal named, the cougar.    The cougar, to which several of the carvings can with but little doubt  be referred, was at the time of the discovery of America and is to-day,  where not exterminated by man, a common resident of the whole of North  America, including of course the whole of the Mississippi Valley. It  would be surprising, therefore, if an animal so striking, and one that  has figured so largely in Indian totemism and folk-lore, should not have  received attention at the hands of the Mound-Builders.    Nothing resembling the toucan, as has been seen, has been found in the  mounds; but, as stated, this bird is found in Southern Mexico.    The buzzard is to-day common over almost the entire United States, and  is especially common throughout most of the Mississippi Valley.    As to the paroquet, there seems to be no evidence in the way of carvings  to show that it was known to the Mound-Builders, although that such was  the case is rendered highly probable from the fact that it lived at  their very doors.    It therefore appears that of the five animals of which Wilson states  \"the majority are not known in the United States,\" and \"some of them are  totally unknown, within any part of the North American continent,\" every  one is found in North America, and all but one within the limits of the  United States, while three were common residents of the Mississippi  Valley.    As a further illustration of the inaccurate zoological knowledge to  which may be ascribed no small share of the theories advanced respecting  the origin of the Mound-Builders, the following illustration may be  taken from Wilson, this author, however, being but one of the many who  are equally in fault. The error is in regard to the habitat of the conch  shell, _Pyrula (now Busycon) perversa_.    After exposing the blunder of Mr. John Delafield, who describes this  shell as unknown on the coasts of North and South America, but as  abundant on the coast of Hindostan, from which supposed fact, coupled  with its presence in the mounds, he assumes a migration on the part of  the Mound-Builders from Southern Asia (Prehistoric Man, vol. 1, p. 219,  _ibid._, p. 272), Wilson states.         No question can exist as to the tropical and marine origin of the       large shells exhumed not only in the inland regions of Kentucky and       Tennessee, but in the northern peninsula lying between the Ontario       and Huron Lakes, or on the still remoter shores and islands of       Georgian Bay, at a distance of upwards of three thousand miles from       the coast of Yucatan, on the mainland, _the nearest point where the       Pyrula perversa is found in its native locality_. (Italics of the       present writer.)    Now the plain facts on the authority of Mr. Dall are that the _Busycon  (Pyrula) perversa_ is not only found in the United States, but extends  along the coast up to Charleston, S.C., with rare specimens as far north  as Beaufort, N.C. Moreover, archaeologists have usually confounded this  species with the _Busycon carica_, which is of common occurrence in the  mounds. The latter is found as far north as Cape Cod. The facts cited  put a very different complexion on the presence of these shells in the  mounds.      OTHER ERRORS OF IDENTIFICATION.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--\"Owl,\" from Squier and Davis.]    The erroneous identification of the manatee, the toucan, and of several  other animals having been pointed out, it may be well to glance at  certain others of the sculptured animal forms, the identification of  which by Squier and Davis has passed without dispute, with a view to  determining how far the accuracy of these authors in this particular  line is to be trusted, and how successful they have been in interpreting  the much lauded \"fidelity to nature\" of the mound sculptures.    Fig. 20 (Squier and Davis, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley,  p. 225, Fig. 123) represents a tube of steatite, upon which is carved,  as is stated, \"in high relief this figure of an owl, attached with its  back to the tube.\" This carving, the authors state, is \"remarkably bold  and spirited, and represents the bird with its claws contracted and  drawn up, and head and beak elevated as if in an attitude of defense and  defiance.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--\"Grouse,\" from Squier and Davis.]    This carving differs markedly from any of the avian sculptures, and  probably was not intended to represent a bird at all. The absence of  feather etchings and the peculiar shape of the wing are especially  noticeable. It more nearly resembles, if it can be said to resemble  anything, a bat, with the features very much distorted.    Fig. 21 (Fig. 170 from Squier and Davis) it is stated, \"will readily be  recognized as intended to represent the head of the grouse.\"    The cere and plainly notched bill of this carving clearly indicate a  hawk, of what species it would be impossible to say.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--\"Turkey Buzzard,\" from Squier and  Davis.]    Fig. 22 (Fig. 171 from Squier and Davis) was, it is said, \"probably  intended to represent a turkey buzzard.\" If so, the suggestion is a very  vague one. The notches cut in the mandibles, as in the case of the  carving of the wood duck (Fig. 168, Ancient Monuments), are perhaps  meant for serrations, of which there is no trace in the bill of the  buzzard. As suggested by Mr. Ridgway, it is perhaps nearer the cormorant  than anything else, although not executed with the detail necessary for  its satisfactory recognition.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--\"Cherry-bird,\" from Squier and Davis.]    Fig. 23 (Fig. 173 from Squier and Davis) it is claimed \"much resembles  the tufted cherry-bird,\" which is by no means the case, as the bill  bears witness. It may pass, however, as a badly executed likeness of the  tufted cardinal grosbeak or red-bird. The same is true of Figs. 174 and  175, which are also said to be \"cherry-birds.\"    Fig. 24 (Fig. 179 from Squier and Davis), of which Squier and Davis say  it is uncertain what bird it is intended to represent, is an  unmistakable likeness of a woodpecker, and is one of the best executed  of the series of bird carvings. To undertake to name the species would  be the merest guess-work.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Woodpecker, from Squier and Davis.]    The heads shown in Fig. 25, which the authors assert \"was probably  intended to represent the eagle\" and \"are far superior in point of  finish, spirit, and truthfulness to any miniature carving, ancient or  modern, which have fallen under the notice of the authors,\" cannot be  identified further than to say they are raptorial birds of some sort,  probably not eagles but hawks.    Fig. 26 (Fig. 180 from Squier and Davis), according to the authors,  \"certainly represents the rattlesnake.\" It certainly represents a snake,  but there is no hint in it of the peculiarities of the rattlesnake;  which, indeed, it would be difficult to portray in a rude carving like  this without showing the rattle. This is done in another carving, Fig.  196.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--\"Eagle,\" from Squier and Davis.]    The extraordinary terms of praise bestowed by the authors on the heads  of the hawks just alluded to, as well as on many other of the sculptured  animals, suggest the question whether the illustrations given in the  Ancient Monuments afford any adequate idea of "]]]
