[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#6)"],[1,"terms \"easts\" and \"wests\" have been mentioned in the  plural. Others have written that by this verse the four seasons of the  year are intended, inasmuch as the dawning and setting points of the sun  vary with the change of the seasons. Such is the depth of their  understanding! None the less, they persist in imputing error and folly to  those Gems of knowledge, those irreproachable and purest Symbols of  wisdom.    In like manner, strive thou to comprehend from these lucid, these  powerful, conclusive, and unequivocal statements the meaning of the  \"cleaving of the heaven\"--one of the signs that must needs herald the  coming of the last Hour, the Day of Resurrection. As He hath said: \"When  the heaven shall be cloven asunder.\"(30) By \"heaven\" is meant the heaven  of divine Revelation, which is elevated with every Manifestation, and rent  asunder with every subsequent one. By \"cloven asunder\" is meant that the  former Dispensation is superseded and annulled. I swear by God! That this  heaven being cloven asunder is, to the discerning, an act mightier than  the cleaving of the skies! Ponder a while. That a divine Revelation which  for years hath been securely established; beneath whose shadow all who  have embraced it have been reared and nurtured; by the light of whose law  generations of men have been disciplined; the excellency of whose word men  have heard recounted by their fathers; in such wise that human eye hath  beheld naught but the pervading influence of its grace, and mortal ear  hath heard naught but the resounding majesty of its command--what act is  mightier than that such a Revelation should, by the power of God, be  \"cloven asunder\" and be abolished at the appearance of one soul? Reflect,  is this a mightier act than that which these abject and foolish men have  imagined the \"cleaving of the heaven\" to mean?    Moreover, consider the hardships and the bitterness of the lives of those  Revealers of the divine Beauty. Reflect, how single-handed and alone they  faced the world and all its peoples, and promulgated the Law of God! No  matter how severe the persecutions inflicted upon those holy, those  precious, and tender Souls, they still remained, in the plenitude of their  power, patient, and, despite their ascendancy, they suffered and endured.    In like manner, endeavour to comprehend the meaning of the \"changing of  the earth.\" Know thou, that upon whatever hearts the bountiful showers of  mercy, raining from the \"heaven\" of divine Revelation, have fallen, the  earth of those hearts hath verily been changed into the earth of divine  knowledge and wisdom. What myrtles of unity hath the soil of their hearts  produced! What blossoms of true knowledge and wisdom hath their illumined  bosoms yielded! Were the earth of their hearts to remain unchanged, how  could such souls who have not been taught one letter, have seen no  teacher, and entered no school, utter such words and display such  knowledge as none can apprehend? Methinks they have been moulded from the  clay of infinite knowledge, and kneaded with the water of divine wisdom.  Therefore, hath it been said: \"Knowledge is a light which God casteth into  the heart of whomsoever He willeth.\" It is this kind of knowledge which is  and hath ever been praiseworthy, and not the limited knowledge that hath  sprung forth from veiled and obscured minds. This limited knowledge they  even stealthily borrow one from the other, and vainly pride themselves  therein!    Would that the hearts of men could be cleansed from these man-made  limitations and obscure thoughts imposed upon them! haply they may be  illumined by the light of the Sun of true knowledge, and comprehend the  mysteries of divine wisdom. Consider now, were the parched and barren soil  of these hearts to remain unchanged, how could they ever become the  Recipients of the revelation of the mysteries of God, and the Revealers of  the divine Essence? Thus hath He said: \"On the day when the earth shall be  changed into another earth.\"(31)    The breeze of the bounty of the King of creation hath caused even the  physical earth to be changed, were ye to ponder in your hearts the  mysteries of divine Revelation.    And now, comprehend the meaning of this verse: \"The whole earth shall on  the Resurrection Day be but His handful, and in His right hand shall the  heavens be folded together. Praise be to Him! and high be He uplifted  above the partners they join with him!\"(32) And now, be fair in thy  judgment. Were this verse to have the meaning which men suppose it to  have, of what profit, one may ask, could it be to man? Moreover, it is  evident and manifest that no such hand as could be seen by human eye could  accomplish such deeds, or could possibly be ascribed to the exalted  Essence of the one true God. Nay, to acknowledge such a thing is naught  but sheer blasphemy, an utter perversion of the truth. And should it be  supposed that by this verse are meant the Manifestations of God, Who will  be called upon, on the Day of Judgment, to perform such deeds, this too  seemeth far from the truth, and is surely of no profit. On the contrary,  by the term \"earth\" is meant the earth of understanding and knowledge, and  by \"heavens\" the heavens of divine Revelation. Reflect thou, how, in one  hand, He hath, by His mighty grasp, turned the earth of knowledge and  understanding, previously unfolded, into a mere handful, and, on the  other, spread out a new and highly exalted earth in the hearts of men,  thus causing the freshest and loveliest blossoms, and the mightiest and  loftiest trees to spring forth from the illumined bosom of man.    In like manner, reflect how the elevated heavens of the Dispensations of  the past have, in the right hand of power, been folded together, how the  heavens of divine Revelation have been raised by the command of God, and  been adorned by the sun, the moon, and stars of His wondrous commandments.  Such are the mysteries of the Word of God, which have been unveiled and  made manifest, that haply thou mayest apprehend the morning light of  divine guidance, mayest quench, by the power of reliance and renunciation,  the lamp of idle fancy, of vain imaginings, of hesitation, and doubt, and  mayest kindle, in the inmost chamber of thine heart, the new-born light of  divine knowledge and certitude.    Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and  abstruse allusions, which emanate from the Revealers of God's holy Cause,  hath been to test and prove the peoples of the world; that thereby the  earth of the pure and illuminated hearts may be known from the perishable  and barren soil. From time immemorial such hath been the way of God amidst  His creatures, and to this testify the records of the sacred books.    And likewise, reflect upon the revealed verse concerning the \"Qiblih.\"(33)  When Muhammad, the Sun of Prophethood, had fled from the dayspring of  Batha(34) unto Yathrib,(35) He continued to turn His face, while praying,  unto Jerusalem, the holy city, until the time when the Jews began to utter  unseemly words against Him--words which if mentioned would ill befit these  pages and would weary the reader. Muhammad strongly resented these words.  Whilst, wrapt in meditation and wonder, He was gazing toward heaven, He  heard the kindly Voice of Gabriel, saying: \"We behold Thee from above,  turning Thy face to heaven; but We will have Thee turn to a Qiblih which  shall please Thee.\"(36) On a subsequent day, when the Prophet, together  with His companions, was offering the noontide prayer, and had already  performed two of the prescribed Rik'ats,(37) the Voice of Gabriel was  heard again: \"Turn Thou Thy face towards the sacred Mosque.\"(38) ,(39) In  the midst of that same prayer, Muhammad suddenly turned His face away from  Jerusalem and faced the Ka'bih. Whereupon, a profound dismay seized  suddenly the companions of the Prophet. Their faith was shaken severely.  So great was their alarm, that many of them, discontinuing their prayer,  apostatized their faith. Verily, God caused not this turmoil but to test  and prove His servants. Otherwise, He, the ideal King, could easily have  left the Qiblih unchanged, and could have caused Jerusalem to remain the  Point of Adoration unto His Dispensation, thereby withholding not from  that holy city the distinction of acceptance which had been conferred upon  it.    None of the many Prophets sent down, since Moses was made manifest, as  Messengers of the Word of God, such as David, Jesus, and others among the  more exalted Manifestations who have appeared during the intervening  period between the Revelations of Moses and Muhammad, ever altered the law  of the Qiblih. These Messengers of the Lord of creation have, one and all,  directed their peoples to turn unto the same direction. In the eyes of  God, the ideal King, all the places of the earth are one and the same,  excepting that place which, in the days of His Manifestations, He doth  appoint for a particular purpose. Even as He hath revealed: \"The East and  West are God's: therefore whichever way ye turn, there is the face of  God.\"(40) Notwithstanding the truth of these facts, why should the Qiblih  have been changed, thus casting such dismay amongst the people, causing  the companions of the Prophet to waver, and throwing so great a confusion  into their midst? Yea, such things as throw consternation into the hearts  of all men come to pass only that each soul may be tested by the  touchstone of God, that the true may be known and distinguished from the  false. Thus hath He revealed after the breach amongst the people: \"We did  not appoint that which Thou wouldst have to be the Qiblih, but that We  might know him who followeth the Apostle from him who turneth on his  heels.\"(41) \"Affrighted asses fleeing from a lion.\"(42)    Were you to ponder, but for a while, these utterances in your heart, you  would surely find the portals of understanding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#6)"],[1,"and on earth, and whose flame Thou feedest with the fuel of Thy wisdom in  the kingdom of Thy creation, to make me to be of those who have soared in  Thine atmosphere, and surrendered their will to Thy decree.    I am all wretchedness, O my Lord, and Thou art the Most Powerful, the  Almighty. Have pity upon me by Thy grace and bountiful favor, and  graciously aid me to serve Thee and them that are dear to Thee. Potent art  Thou to do as Thou willest. No God is there but Thee, the God of strength,  of glory and wisdom.            XXIX: \"MANY A CHILLED HEART, O MY GOD, HATH BEEN SET...\"      Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been set ablaze with the fire of Thy  Cause, and many a slumberer hath been wakened by the sweetness of Thy  voice. How many are the strangers who have sought shelter beneath the  shadow of the tree of Thy oneness, and how numerous the thirsty ones who  have panted after the fountain of Thy living waters in Thy days!    Blessed is he that hath set himself towards Thee, and hasted to attain the  Day-Spring of the lights of Thy face. Blessed is he who with all his  affections hath turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the  Fountain-Head of Thine inspiration. Blessed is he that hath expended in  Thy path what Thou didst bestow upon him through Thy bounty and favor.  Blessed is he who, in his sore longing after Thee, hath cast away all else  except Thyself. Blessed is he who hath enjoyed intimate communion with  Thee, and rid himself of all attachment to any one save Thee.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Him Who is Thy Name, Who, through the power  of Thy sovereignty and might, hath risen above the horizon of His prison,  to ordain for every one what becometh Thee and beseemeth Thine exaltation.    Thy might, in truth, is equal to all things.            XXX: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! THOU SEEST...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou seest me in this day shut up in my  prison, and fallen into the hands of Thine adversaries, and beholdest my  son (The Purest Branch) lying on the dust before Thy face. He is Thy  servant, O my Lord, whom Thou hast caused to be related to Him Who is the  Manifestation of Thyself and the Day-Spring of Thy Cause.    At his birth he was afflicted through his separation from Thee, according  to what had been ordained for him through Thine irrevocable decree. And  when he had quaffed the cup of reunion with Thee, he was cast into prison  for having believed in Thee and in Thy signs. He continued to serve Thy  Beauty until he entered into this Most Great Prison. Thereupon I offered  him up, O my God, as a sacrifice in Thy path. Thou well knowest what they  who love Thee have endured through this trial that hath caused the  kindreds of the earth to wail, and beyond them the Concourse on high to  lament.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by him and by his exile and his imprisonment,  to send down upon such as loved him what will quiet their hearts and bless  their works. Potent art Thou to do as Thou willest. No God is there but  Thee, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.            XXXI: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O MY GOD! I BESEECH THEE BY...\"      Praised be Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by them who have circled round  the throne of Thy will, and soared in the atmosphere of Thy good-pleasure,  and turned with all their affections towards the Horizon of Thy Revelation  and the Day-Spring of Thine inspiration, and the Dawning-Place of Thy  names, to aid Thy servants to observe what Thou hast commanded them in Thy  days--commandments through which the sacredness of Thy Cause will be  demonstrated unto Thy servants and the affairs of Thy creatures and of Thy  realm will be set aright.    I testify, O my God, that this is the Day whereon Thy testimony hath been  fulfilled, and Thy clear tokens have been manifested, and Thine utterances  have been revealed, and Thy signs have been demonstrated, and the radiance  of Thy countenance hath been diffused, and Thy proof hath been perfected,  and Thine ascendancy hath been established, and Thy mercy hath overflowed,  and the Day-Star of Thy grace hath shone forth with such brilliance that  Thou didst manifest Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and the Treasury of  Thy wisdom and the Dawning-Place of Thy majesty and power. Thou didst  establish His covenant with every one who hath been created in the  kingdoms of earth and heaven and in the realms of revelation and of  creation. Thou didst raise Him up to such heights that the wrongs  inflicted by the oppressors have been powerless to deter Him from  revealing Thy sovereignty, and the ascendancy of the wayward hath failed  to prevent Him from demonstrating Thy power and from exalting Thy Cause.    So highly didst Thou exalt Him that He openly delivered unto the kings Thy  messages and commandments, and hath never for one moment sought His own  protection, but striven to protect Thy servants from whatever might  withhold them from approaching the kingdom of Thy nearness, and from  setting their faces towards the horizon of Thy good-pleasure.    Thou seest, O my God, how, notwithstanding the swords that are drawn  against Him, He calleth the nations unto Thee, and though Himself a  prisoner summoneth them to turn in the direction of Thy gifts and  bounties. With every fresh tribulation He manifested a fuller measure of  Thy Cause, and exalted more highly Thy word.    I testify that through Him the Pen of the Most High was set in motion, and  with His remembrance the Scriptures in the kingdom of names were  embellished. Through Him Thy fragrances were wafted, and the sweet smell  of Thy raiment was shed abroad amongst all the dwellers of the earth and  the inmates of heaven. Thou seest and knowest full well, O my God, how He  hath been made to dwell within the most desolate of cities, so that He may  build up the hearts of Thy servants, and hath been willing to suffer the  most grievous abasement, that Thy creatures may be exalted.    I pray Thee, O Thou Who causest the dawn to appear, by Thy Name through  Which Thou hast subjected the winds, and sent down Thy Tablets, that Thou  wilt grant that we may draw near unto what Thou didst destine for us by  Thy favor and bounty, and to be far removed from whatsoever may be  repugnant unto Thee. Give us, then, to drink from the hands of Thy grace  every day and every moment of our lives of the waters that are life  indeed, O Thou Who art the Most Merciful! Make us, then, to be of them who  helped Thee when fallen into the hands of those Thine enemies who are  numbered with the rebellious among Thy creatures and the wicked amidst Thy  people. Write down, then, for us the recompense ordained for him that hath  attained Thy presence, and gazed on Thy beauty, and supply us with every  good thing ordained in Thy Book for such of Thy creatures as enjoy near  access to Thee.    Brighten our hearts, O my Lord, with the splendor of Thy knowledge, and  illumine our sight with the light of such eyes as are fixed upon the  horizon of Thy grace and the Day-Spring of Thy glory. Preserve us, then,  by Thy Most Great Name, Which Thou didst cause to overshadow such nations  as lay claim to what Thou hast forbidden in Thy Book. This, verily, is  what Thou didst announce unto us in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets.    Cause us, then, to be so steadfast in our love towards Thee that we will  turn to none except Thee, and will be reckoned amongst them that are  brought nigh to Thee, and acknowledge Thee as One Who is exalted above  every comparison and is holy beyond all likeness, and will lift up our  voices amongst Thy servants and cry aloud that He is the one God, the  Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the  All-Wise.    Strengthen Thou, O my Lord, the hearts of them that love Thee, that they  may not be affrighted by the hosts of the infidels that are turned back  from Thee, but may follow Thee in whatsoever hath been revealed by Thee.  Aid them, moreover, to remember and to praise Thee, and to teach Thy Cause  with eloquence and wisdom. Thou art He Who hath called Himself the Most  Merciful. Ordain, then, O my God, for me and for whosoever hath sought  Thee what beseemeth the excellence of Thy glory and the greatness of Thy  majesty. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Compassionate.            XXXII: \"THOU SEEST THY DEAR ONE, O MY GOD, LYING AT...\"      Thou seest Thy dear One, O my God, lying at the mercy of Thine enemies,  and hearest the voice of His lamentation from the midst of such of Thy  creatures as have dealt wickedly in Thy sight. He it is, O my Lord,  through Whose name Thou didst beautify Thy Tablets, and for Whose greater  glory Thou didst send down the Bayan, and at Whose separation from Thee  Thou didst weep continually. Look Thou, then, upon His loneliness, O my  God, and behold Him fallen into the hands of them that have disbelieved in  Thy signs, have turned their backs upon Thee, and have forgotten the  wonders of Thy mercy.    He it is, O my God, about Whom Thou hast said: \"But for Thee the  Scriptures would have remained unrevealed, and the Prophets unsent.\" And  no sooner had He, by Thy behest, been manifested and spoken forth Thy  praise, than the wicked doers among Thy creatures compassed Him round,  with the swords of hate drawn against Him, O Thou the Lord of all names!  Thou well knowest what befell Him at the hands of such as have rent  asunder the veil of Thy grandeur, and cast behind their backs Thy Covenant  and Thy Testament, O Thou Who art the Maker of the heavens! He is the One  for Whose sake Thou (the Bab) hast yielded Thy life, and hast consented to  be touched by the manifold ills of the world that He may manifest Himself,  and summoned all mankind in His name. As soon as He came down, however,  from the heaven of majesty and power, Thy servants stretched out against  Him the hands of cruelty and sedition, and caused Him to be afflicted with"]]]
