One by one the others came over to him and       whispered in his ear a seven-syllabled word, and each time he       nodded in approval. After that all returned to their former       places. 'Brethren,' said the Levite, 'our fathers formed a union       which compels all those chosen as representatives of the tribes to       gather every hundred years at the grave of the great teacher of       Caballah whose doctrines give the chosen ones power on earth and       supremacy over all the descendants of Ishmael. Eighteen hundred       years the struggle has been conducted by the nation of Israel for       supremacy which was promised to Abraham and which was taken away       from us by the Cross. Trampled under foot by our enemies, under the       terror of death and all kinds of humiliation and violence, the       nation of Israel, nevertheless, has not abandoned this struggle,       and as they are scattered all over the earth, the whole earth must       belong to them! Our learned men are conducting this struggle for       hundreds of years; the nation is gradually rising from its fall;       its power is growing and spreading. To us belongs the earthly god,       which was made for us with such sorrow by Aaron in the desert ...       the Golden Calf which the backsliders are worshipping!'         \"'We hear!' they whispered on all sides.         \"'When all the gold on earth will be ours, the power will go over       to us. Then will be fulfilled the promise made to Abraham. Gold is       the ruler of the earth. Gold is power, reward, pleasure ... all       that human beings fear and desire. This is the mystery of the       Caballa ... the teachings concerning the spirit which rules the       world, and about the future! Eighteen centuries we have belonged to       our enemies. The future belongs to us. For the fifth time in the       course of the thousand-year-old struggle to which we have       consecrated ourselves, those who know of the existence of the       secret union have gathered here to take counsel as to the means       which are afforded us by the sins of our enemies, and each time,       for five hundreds years, a new Sanhedrim, ordered the fiercest       struggle. But, excepting Russia, not a single century has been       crowned with such success as this one. Therefore we may think that       the time for which we are striving is near, and we may say, \"The       Future is ours!\"'         \"'Yes, if persecutions against the Jews will not take place in the       meantime!' pointed out one of the men with a bitter smile.         \"'The dark days of such a danger are passed. The success of       so-called civilization among the Christian nations may serve as the       best protection for our endeavors. Before listening to the       individual opinions, let us examine the material means, the pure       capital possessed by the nation of Israel....'         \"'But against the three and a half million Jews with their money       there are 265 million enemies in Europe, or rather 500 million       fists,' remarked one of these present.         \"'The head will protect us against the fists, as in the past. Labor       is the slave of speculation, and violence is the slave of wisdom.       Who will deny that cunning is the distinctive trait of our nation?         \"'Our nation is ostentatious and greedy, arrogant and       pleasure-loving.         \"'Where there is light there is also shadow. It is not in vain that       Adonai our God gave his chosen people the tenacity of a snake, the       cunning of a fox, the look of a falcon, the memory of a dog, the       diligence of an ant, and the sociability of a beaver. We were in       captivity on the rivers of Babylon, and have become powerful! Our       temple was destroyed, but we have built a thousand new temples! For       eighteen hundreds years we were slaves; now we have grown head and       shoulders above all other nations.'         \"All the twelve pronounced the concluding words--         \"'Brethren,' said the Levite, 'the time has come when, in       accordance with the laws of the founder of our union, we must       determine ways and means by which the Jews shall attain their goal       as soon as possible; our experience of a hundred years will help us       in this. We who know must direct and guide the masses which are       blind. We, the builders, will combine the dead stones into a pillar       which must reach the sky.'         \"'The Tower of Babel was destroyed by the hand of Him whose name I       dare not pronounce,' said the sceptic.         \"'Our structure rests upon the foundation of the promise made to       Abraham. It is your turn to speak, representative of the tribe of       Reuben! By what means will the Jewish nation achieve power and       supremacy over all other nations on earth?'         \"A shrill, unpleasant voice then spoke:         \"'All the princes and the lands of Europe are at present in debt.       The stock exchange regulates these debts. But such things are done       only by movable capital; therefore all the movable capital must go       over to the hands of the Jews. The foundation for this is already       laid, judging from what we have heard here. If we will be supreme       in the stock exchange, we will attain the same supremacy in the       governments. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate loans in order       to get them into our hands all the more. Wherever possible, we must       take in exchange for capital, mortgages on railroads, taxes, mines,       regalia and domains. Furthermore, the stock exchange is a means for       the transfer of the belongings of the small people to the hands of       the capitalists, by drawing them into stock gambling. Transactions       in securities are a splendid invention of our nation. Although the       stock exchange members cheat one another sometimes, it is the       outsider who always pays in the end.'         \"The voice which resounded on the Paris Bourse became silent.         \"'Do the _zekenim_ agree with the opinion of our brother?' asked       the Levite.         \"A whisper of approbation was the answer to this question.         \"'Representative of the tribe of Simeon, it is your turn now!'         \"A serious, dull voice resounded after this order. Each word was       pronounced slowly and thoughtfully:         \"'Ownership of land is always the iron-clad, everlasting possession       of every country. This in itself gives power, respect and       influence. Therefore, the Jews should secure the possibility of       acquiring real estate. It will not be hard to accomplish this, if       we acquire movable capital. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate       loans on land. Under the fear of scandal we will destroy land       wealth and minimize its importance. Ownership of land should be       mobilized, if lands are sold as other commodities. The more we help       in the breaking up of estates, the more easily will they fall into       our hands. Under the pretext of relieving the poor classes, it is       necessary to levy all taxes of states and communities on the land       owners. When the land is in our hands, the labor of the Christian       workers and farmers will give us a tenfold income.'         \"He who did not belong to any tribe laughed sneeringly.         \"'This advice is good, but not new. Ask in Paris and in Vienna, who       owns the houses there?'         \"A whisper of approbation was heard again.         \"'Tribe of Judah, your turn!'         \"The voice that resounded was marked with conviction and reminded       one of the sound of the Thaller.         \"'Industry, the power of the burgher, which hinders the Jewish       nation, must be paralyzed even as agriculture. The manufacturer       should be no better than an ordinary worker. The means to       accomplish this may be the unlimited freedom of trade. The       manufacturer will take the place of the artisan as he does not have       to work, only to speculate. The children of Israel can adapt       themselves to all branches of work. Their capital and dexterity       will be the substitute for right. Transforming the artisans into       our factory workers, we will be in a position to direct the masses       for our political purposes. Whoever resists this system will be       destroyed by competition. The senseless and ungrateful masses will       not support the artisans in this struggle, if commodities are       reduced in price to a certain extent.         \"A noisy approbation of the new Sanhedrin showed that the soundness       of this advice had long been appreciated and even applied in       practice.         \"'Now it is my turn,' said the representative of Levi--'I speak in       the name of the tribe of Aaron. The natural enemy of the Jews is       the Christian church. Therefore we must try to humiliate it, we       must instill into it free-thinking, scepticism, and conflicts.       Therefore we will, first of all, start a war on the clergy, we will       try to arouse suspicion against it and ridicule it. The main pillar       of the church is the school. Therefore we must gain influence over       the young. Under the guise of progress and the equal rights of all       religions, we will destroy the study of religion in Christian       schools. Then the Jews may become teachers in all schools; then       religion will be taught at home. And as there is little time left       for that, the spirit of religion will gradually decline, and       eventually it will be destroyed altogether. Agitation for the       appropriation of property belonging to the churches and schools,       the transfer of church property to the state, or (what is the same)       into the hands of the Jews, will be our reward!'         \"Again approbation followed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19206"],[0,"Under Drake's Flag: A Tale of the Spanish Main (#6)"],[1,"and timid in their  demeanor They were copper in color, and wore headdresses of bright  feathers, but the men had but little other clothing; of which,  indeed, in such a climate, there is but slight necessity.    In exchange for some trifles from the ship they brought many  baskets of fruits, such as none of those who had fresh come from  England had ever before seen. Great was the joy on board ship,  especially among the four boys, at the profusion of strange fruits;  and they were seen, seated together, eating pineapples, bananas,  and many other things of which they knew not so much as the name,  but which they found delicious, indeed, after so long a voyage upon  salted food.    Then, sailing on, they dropped anchor in the bay which Captain  Drake had himself christened, during his last voyage, Port  Pheasant; for they had killed many of this kind of bird there. Here  the admiral purposed waiting for a while, to refresh the crews and  to put the pinnaces together. Accordingly the anchors were put out,  and all was made snug.    A boat's crew was sent on shore to see that all was safe, for there  was no saying where the Spaniards might be lurking. They returned  with a great plate of lead, which they had found fastened to a  tree, close to the water's edge. Upon it were these words:    \"Captain Drake, if it is your fortune to come into this part, make  haste away; for the Spaniards which were with you here, last year,  have betrayed the place; and taken away all that you left here. I  departed hence on this present 7th July, 1572. Your very loving  friend, John Garrett.\"    \"I would I had been here a few days earlier,\" Captain Drake said,  when he read this notice, \"for John Garrett would assuredly have  joined us, and his aid would have been no slight assistance in the  matter in which we are about to engage. However, it will not do to  despise his caution; therefore, lest we be attacked while on shore  by the Spaniards, we will even make a fort; and we shall be able to  unload our stores, and put our pinnaces together, without fear of  interruption.\"    The crew were now landed; and set to work, with hatchet and bill,  to clear a plot of ground. Three quarters of an acre was, after  three days' work, cleared; and the trees were cast outwards, and  piled together in such form as to make a sort of wall, 30 feet  high, round it. This hard work done, most of the crew were allowed  a little liberty; the carpenters, and experienced artificers, being  engaged in putting the three pinnaces together.    The boys, in pairs, for all could never obtain leave together,  rambled in the woods, full of admiration for the beauties of  nature. Huge butterflies flitted about upon the brilliant flowers.  Long trailing creepers, rich with blossom, hung on the trees. Here  and there, as they passed along, snakes slipped away among the  undergrowth; and these, in truth, the boys were as ready to leave  alone as the reptiles were to avoid them, for they were told that  it was certain death to be bitten by these creatures. Most of all  the boys admired the little birds, which indeed it was hard for  them to believe not to be butterflies, so small were they, so rapid  their movements, and so brilliant their color.    On the 7th day from landing the pinnaces were finished; and, the  vessels being anchored near the shore, the crews went on board for  the last time, preparatory to making their start the next day.    There was one tall and bright-faced sailor with whom the boys had  struck up a great friendship. He had sailed before with Captain  Drake; and as the evening was cool, and there was naught to do,  they begged him to tell them of his former visits in the Caribbean  Seas.    \"My first,\" he said, \"was the worst, and might well have been my  last. Captain John Hawkins was our captain, a bold man and a good  sailor; but not gentle as well as brave, as is our good Captain  Francis. Our fleet was a strong one. The admiral's ship, the Jesus,  of Lubeck, was 700 tons. Then there were the smaller craft; the  Minion, Captain Hampton, in which I myself sailed; the William and  John of Captain Boulton; the Judith with Captain Francis Drake; and  two little ships, besides. We sailed later in the year. It was the  2nd October, five years back; that is, 1567. We started badly, for  a storm struck us off Finisterre, the ships separated, and some  boats were lost.    \"We came together at Cape de Verde, and there we tried to get  slaves; for it was part of the object of our voyage to buy slaves  on the coast of Africa, and sell them to the Spaniards, here. It  was a traffic for which I myself had but little mind; for though it  be true that these black fellows are a pernicious race, given to  murder, and to fightings of all kinds among themselves, yet are  they human beings; and it is, methinks, cruel to send them beyond  the seas into slavery, so far from their homes and people. But it  was not for me, a simple mariner, to argue the question with our  admirals and captains; and I have heard many worshipful merchants  are engaged in the traffic.    \"However that be, methinks that our good Captain Francis did,  likewise, turn himself against this kind of traffic in human flesh;  for although he has been three times, since, in these regions, he  has never again taken a hand in it.    \"With much to do at Cape de Verde, we succeeded in getting a  hundred and fifty men; but not without much resistance from the  natives, who shot their arrows at us, and wounded many; and most of  those who were wounded did die of lock-jaw, for the arrows had been  smeared in some poisonous stuff. Then we went farther down the  coast, and took in two hundred more.    \"Coasting still farther down, to Saint Jorge de Mina, we landed;  and Captain Hawkins found that the negro king there was at war with  an enemy, a little farther inland. He besought our assistance, and  promised us plenty of slaves, if we would go there and storm the  place with him. Captain Hawkins agreed, cheerfully enough; and set  off, with a portion of his crews, to assist the king.    \"The enemy fought well, and it was only after a very hard fight on  our part, and a loss of many men, that we took the town. Methinks  the two hundred and fifty slaves which we took there were dearly  paid for; and there was much grumbling, among the ships, at the  reckless way in which our admiral had risked our lives, for meager  gain. It is true that these slaves would sell at a high price, yet  none of us looked upon money, gained in that way, quite as we do  upon treasure taken in fair fight. In the one case we traffic with  the Spaniards, who are our natural enemies; and it is repugnant, to  a Christian man, to hand over even these poor negroes to such  willful masters as these; in the other we are fighting for our  queen and country. The Spaniards are the natural enemies of all  good Protestants, and every ship we see, and every treasure bag we  capture, does something to pare the nails of that fierce and  haughty power.    \"Having filled up our hold with the slaves which we had captured at  Saint Jorge de Mina, we turned our back upon the African coast, and  sailed to the West Indies. At Rio de Hacha, the first port at which  we touched, the people did not wish to trade with us; but the  admiral was not the man to allow people to indulge in fancies of  this kind. We soon forced them to buy, or to sell, that which we  chose; and not what they had a fancy for.    \"Sailing along, we were caught in a storm; and in searching for the  port of Saint Juan d'Ulloa, where we hoped to refit, we captured  three ships. In the port we found twelve other small craft, but  these we released; and sent some of them to Mexico, to ask that  victuals and stores might be sent.    \"The next day thirteen great ships appeared off the harbor In them  was the Viceroy of Mexico. We had then only the Jesus, the Minion  of 100 tons, and the Judith of 50 tons, and this big fleet was  large enough to have eaten us; but Captain Hawkins put a good face  on it, and sailed out to meet them, waiting at the mouth of the  harbor Here he told them haughtily that he should not allow their  fleet to enter, save on his terms. I doubt not that Hawkins would  have been glad enough to have made off, if he could have done so;  for what with the sale of the slaves, and the vessels we had  captured, we had now 1,800,000 pounds, in silver and gold, on board  of the ships. The Spanish admiral accepted the terms which Captain  Hawkins laid down, and most solemnly swore to observe them.    \"So with colors flying, both fleets sailed into the harbor  together. It is true, however, that the man who places faith in a  Spaniard is a fool, and so it proved to us. No sooner had they  reached the port than they began to plot, secretly among  themselves, how to fall upon us. Even then, though they had  thirteen big ships, the smallest of which was larger than the  Jesus, they feared to attack us openly.    \"Numbers of men were set to work by them on the shore, secretly, to  get up batteries by which they might fire into us; while a great  ship, having 500 men on board, was moored close alongside the  Minion.    \"I remember well talking the matter over with Jack Boscowan, who  was boatswain on board; and we agreed that this time we had run  into an ugly trap, and that we did not see our way out of it.  Englishmen can, as all the world knows, lick the Spaniards when  they are but as one to five; but when there are twenty of the Dons  to one of us, it is clear that the task is a hard one.    \"What made it worse was that we were in harbor At sea, our  quickness in handling our ships would have made us a match for the  Spanish fleet; but at anchor, and with the guns of the port  commanding us, we did not truly see how we were to get out of it.    \"The fight began by the Spaniards letting their big ship drift  alongside the Minion; when, suddenly, 500 men leapt out"]]]
