She came the third time about an  hour ago, and has been upstairs since.\"    \"Do you know her, Mrs. Dolan?\"    Mrs. Dolan grew embarrassed again.    \"Well, Doctor,\" she said, wiping her eyes the while, \"I DO.  And God  knows he was a good lad, and I like a mother to him; but she is not the  girl I should have liked a son of mine to take up with.\"    At any other time, this would have been amusing; now, it might be  serious.  Mrs. Dolan's account of the wailing became suddenly  significant, for perhaps it meant that one of Fu-Manchu's dacoit  followers was watching the house, to give warning of any stranger's  approach!  Warning to whom?  It was unlikely that I should forget the  dark eyes of another of Fu-Manchu's servants.  Was that lure of men  even now in the house, completing her evil work?    \"I should never have allowed her in his rooms--\" began Mrs. Dolan  again.  Then there was an interruption.    A soft rustling reached my ears--intimately feminine.  The girl was  stealing down!    I leaped out into the hall, and she turned and fled blindly before  me--back up the stairs!  Taking three steps at a time, I followed her,  bounded into the room above almost at her heels, and stood with my back  to the door.    She cowered against the desk by the window, a slim figure in a clinging  silk gown, which alone explained Mrs. Dolan's distrust.  The gaslight  was turned very low, and her hat shadowed her face, but could not hide  its startling beauty, could not mar the brilliancy of the skin, nor dim  the wonderful eyes of this modern Delilah.  For it was she!    \"So I came in time,\" I said grimly, and turned the key in the lock.    \"Oh!\" she panted at that, and stood facing me, leaning back with her  jewel-laden hands clutching the desk edge.    \"Give me whatever you have removed from here,\" I said sternly, \"and  then prepare to accompany me.\"    She took a step forward, her eyes wide with fear, her lips parted.    \"I have taken nothing,\" she said.  Her breast was heaving tumultuously.  \"Oh, let me go!  Please, let me go!\"  And impulsively she threw herself  forward, pressing clasped hands against my shoulder and looking up into  my face with passionate, pleading eyes.    It is with some shame that I confess how her charm enveloped me like a  magic cloud.  Unfamiliar with the complex Oriental temperament, I had  laughed at Nayland Smith when he had spoken of this girl's infatuation.  \"Love in the East,\" he had said, \"is like the conjurer's mango-tree; it  is born, grows and flowers at the touch of a hand.\" Now, in those  pleading eyes I read confirmation of his words.  Her clothes or her  hair exhaled a faint perfume.  Like all Fu-Manchu's servants, she was  perfectly chosen for her peculiar duties.  Her beauty was wholly  intoxicating.    But I thrust her away.    \"You have no claim to mercy,\" I said.  \"Do not count upon any.  What  have you taken from here?\"    She grasped the lapels of my coat.    \"I will tell you all I can--all I dare,\" she panted eagerly, fearfully.  \"I should know how to deal with your friend, but with you I am lost!  If you could only understand you would not be so cruel.\"  Her slight  accent added charm to the musical voice.  \"I am not free, as your  English women are.  What I do I must do, for it is the will of my  master, and I am only a slave.  Ah, you are not a man if you can give  me to the police.  You have no heart if you can forget that I tried to  save you once.\"    I had feared that plea, for, in her own Oriental fashion, she certainly  had tried to save me from a deadly peril once--at the expense of my  friend.  But I had feared the plea, for I did not know how to meet it.  How could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?  And  now I fell silent, and she saw why I was silent.    \"I may deserve no mercy; I may be even as bad as you think; but what  have YOU to do with the police?  It is not your work to hound a woman  to death.  Could you ever look another woman in the eyes--one that you  loved, and know that she trusted you--if you had done such a thing?  Ah, I have no friend in all the world, or I should not be here.  Do not  be my enemy, my judge, and make me worse than I am; be my friend, and  save me--from HIM.\" The tremulous lips were close to mine, her breath  fanned my cheek.  \"Have mercy on me.\"    At that moment I honestly would have given half of my worldly  possessions to have been spared the decision which I knew I must come  to.  After all, what proof had I that she was a willing accomplice of  Dr. Fu-Manchu?  Furthermore, she was an Oriental, and her code must  necessarily be different from mine.  Irreconcilable as the thing may be  with Western ideas, Nayland Smith had really told me that he believed  the girl to be a slave.  Then there remained that other reason why I  loathed the idea of becoming her captor.  It was almost tantamount to  betrayal!  Must I soil my hands with such work?    Thus--I suppose--her seductive beauty argued against my sense of right.  The jeweled fingers grasped my shoulders nervously, and her slim body  quivered against mine as she watched me, with all her soul in her eyes,  in an abandonment of pleading despair.  Then I remembered the fate of  the man in whose room we stood.    \"You lured Cadby to his death,\" I said, and shook her off.    \"No, no!\" she cried wildly, clutching at me.  \"No, I swear by the holy  name I did not!  I did not!  I watched him, spied upon him--yes!  But,  listen: it was because he would not be warned that he met his death.  I  could not save him!  Ah, I am not so bad as that.  I will tell you.  I  have taken his notebook and torn out the last pages and burnt them.  Look!  in the grate.  The book was too big to steal away.  I came twice  and could not find it.  There, will you let me go?\"    \"If you will tell me where and how to seize Dr. Fu-Manchu--yes.\"    Her hands dropped and she took a backward step.  A new terror was to be  read in her face.    \"I dare not!  I dare not!\"    \"Then you would--if you dared?\"    She was watching me intently.    \"Not if YOU would go to find him,\" she said.    And, with all that I thought her to be, the stern servant of justice  that I would have had myself, I felt the hot blood leap to my cheek at  all which the words implied.  She grasped my arm.    \"Could you hide me from him if I came to you, and told you all I know?\"    \"The authorities--\"    \"Ah!\"  Her expression changed.  \"They can put me on the rack if they  choose, but never one word would I speak--never one little word.\"    She threw up her head scornfully.  Then the proud glance softened again.    \"But I will speak for you.\"    Closer she came, and closer, until she could whisper in my ear.    \"Hide me from your police, from HIM, from everybody, and I will no  longer be his slave.\"    My heart was beating with painful rapidity.  I had not counted on this  warring with a woman; moreover, it was harder than I could have dreamt  of.  For some time I had been aware that by the charm of her  personality and the art of her pleading she had brought me down from my  judgment seat--had made it all but impossible for me to give her up to  justice.  Now, I was disarmed--but in a quandary.  What should I do?  What COULD I do?  I turned away from her and walked to the hearth, in  which some paper ash lay and yet emitted a faint smell.    Not more than ten seconds elapsed, I am confident, from the time that I  stepped across the room until I glanced back.  But she had gone!    As I leapt to the door the key turned gently from the outside.    \"Ma 'alesh!\" came her soft whisper; \"but I am afraid to trust you--yet.  Be comforted, for there is one near who would have killed you had I  wished it.  Remember, I will come to you whenever you will take me and  hide me.\"    Light footsteps pattered down the stairs.  I heard a stifled cry from  Mrs. Dolan as the mysterious visitor ran past her.  The front door  opened and closed.        CHAPTER V      \"Shen-Yan's is a dope-shop in one of the burrows off the old Ratcliff  Highway,\" said Inspector Weymouth.    \"'Singapore Charlie's,' they call it.  It's a center for some of the  Chinese societies, I believe, but all sorts of opium-smokers use it.  There have never been any complaints that I know of.  I don't  understand this.\"    We stood in his room at New Scotland Yard, bending over a sheet of  foolscap upon which were arranged some burned fragments from poor  Cadby's grate, for so hurriedly had the girl done her work that  combustion had not been complete.    \"What do we make of this?\" said Smith.  \"'. . . Hunchback . . . lascar  went up . . . unlike others . . . not return . . . till Shen-Yan'  (there is no doubt about the name, I think) 'turned me out . . . booming  sound . . . lascar in . . . mortuary I could ident . . . not for days,  or suspici . . . Tuesday night in a different make . . . snatch  . . . pigtail . . .'\"    \"The pigtail again!\" rapped Weymouth.    \"She evidently burned the torn-out pages all together,\" continued  Smith.  \"They lay flat, and this was in the middle.  I see the hand of  retributive justice in that, Inspector.  Now we have a reference to a  hunchback, and what follows amounts to this: A lascar (amongst several  other persons) went up somewhere--presumably upstairs--at Shen-Yan's,  and did not come down again.  Cadby, who was there disguised, noted a  booming sound.  Later, he identified the lascar in some mortuary.  We  have no means of fixing the date of this visit to Shen-Yan's, but I  feel inclined to put down the 'lascar' as the dacoit who was murdered  by Fu-Manchu!  It is sheer supposition, however.  But that Cadby meant  to pay another visit to the place in a different 'make-up' or disguise,  is evident, and that the Tuesday night proposed was last night is a  reasonable deduction.  The reference to a pigtail is principally  interesting because of what was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#6)"],[1,"of industry after the invention of the lace machine in  1777; soon after that date Lindley invented the point-net machine, and in  1809 Heathcote invented the bobbin-net machine, in consequence of which  the production of lace was greatly simplified, and the demand increased  proportionately in consequence of the diminished cost, so that now, at  least 200,000 persons are supported by this industry.  Its chief centres  are Nottingham, Leicester, and the West of England, Wiltshire,  Devonshire, etc.  A corresponding extension has taken place in the  branches dependent upon the cotton industry, in dyeing, bleaching, and  printing.  Bleaching by the application of chlorine in place of the  oxygen of the atmosphere; dyeing and printing by the rapid development of  chemistry, and printing by a series of most brilliant mechanical  inventions, a yet greater advance which, with the extension of these  branches caused by the growth of the cotton industry, raised them to a  previously unknown degree of prosperity.    The same activity manifested itself in the manufacture of wool.  This had  hitherto been the leading department of English industry, but the  quantities formerly produced are as nothing in comparison with that which  is now manufactured.  In 1782 the whole wool crop of the preceding three  years lay unused for want of workers, and would have continued so to lie  if the newly invented machinery had not come to its assistance and spun  it.  The adaptation of this machinery to the spinning of wool was most  successfully accomplished.  Then began the same sudden development in the  wool district, which we have already seen in the cotton districts.  In  1738 there were 75,000 pieces of woollen cloth produced in the West  Riding of Yorkshire; in 1817 there were 490,000 pieces, and so rapid was  the extension of the industry that in 1834, 450,000 more pieces were  produced than in 1825.  In 1801, 101,000,000 pounds of wool (7,000,000  pounds of it imported) were worked up; in 1835, 180,000,000 pounds were  worked up; of which 42,000,000 pounds were imported.  The principal  centre of this industry is the West Riding of Yorkshire, where,  especially at Bradford, long English wool is converted into worsted  yarns, etc.; while in the other cities, Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield,  etc., short wool is converted into hard-spun yarn and cloth.  Then come  the adjacent part of Lancashire, the region of Rochdale, where in  addition to the cotton industry much flannel is produced, and the West of  England which supplies the finest cloths.  Here also the growth of  population is worthy of observation:    Bradford contained in 1801 29,000, and in 1831 77,000 inhabitants.  Halifax ,, ,, 68,000, ,, ,, 110,000 ,,  Huddersfield ,, ,, 15,000, ,, ,, 34,000 ,,  Leeds,, ,, 53,000, ,, ,, 123,000 ,,    And the whole West Riding 564,000, ,, ,, 980,000 ,,    A population which, since 1831, must have increased at least 20 to 25 per  cent. further.  In 1835 the spinning of wool employed in the United  Kingdom 1,313 mills, with 71,300 workers, these last being but a small  portion of the multitude who are supported directly or indirectly by the  manufacture of wool, and excluding nearly all weavers.    Progress in the linen trade developed later, because the nature of the  raw material made the application of spinning machinery very difficult.  Attempts had been made in the last years of the last century in Scotland,  but the Frenchman, Girard, who introduced flax spinning in 1810, was the  first who succeeded practically, and even Girard's machines first  attained on British soil the importance they deserved by means of  improvements which they underwent in England, and of their universal  application in Leeds, Dundee, and Belfast.  From this time the British  linen trade rapidly extended.  In 1814, 3,000 tons of flax were imported;  in 1833, nearly 19,000 tons of flax and 3,400 tons of hemp.  The export  of Irish linen to Great Britain rose from 32,000,000 yards in 1800 to  53,000,000 in 1825, of which a large part was re-exported.  The export of  English and Scotch woven linen goods rose from 24,000,000 yards in 1820  to 51,000,000 yards in 1833.  The number of flax spinning establishments  in 1835 was 347, employing 33,000 workers, of which one-half were in the  South of Scotland, more than 60 in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Leeds,  and its environs, 25 in Belfast, Ireland, and the rest in Dorset and  Lancashire.  Weaving is carried on in the South of Scotland, here and  there in England, but principally in Ireland.    With like success did the English turn their attention to the manufacture  of silk.  Raw material was imported from Southern Europe and Asia ready  spun, and the chief labour lay in the twisting of fine threads.  Until  1824 the heavy import duty, four shillings per pound on raw material,  greatly retarded the development of the English silk industry, while only  the markets of England and the Colonies were protected for it.  In that  year the duty was reduced to one penny, and the number of mills at once  largely increased.  In a single year the number of throwing spindles rose  from 780,000 to 1,180,000; and, although the commercial crisis of 1825  crippled this branch of industry for the moment, yet in 1827 more was  produced than ever, the mechanical skill and experience of the English  having secured their twisting machinery the supremacy over the awkward  devices of their competitors.  In 1835 the British Empire possessed 263  twisting mills, employing 30,000 workers, located chiefly in Cheshire, in  Macclesfield, Congleton, and the surrounding districts, and in Manchester  and Somersetshire.  Besides these, there are numerous mills for working  up waste, from which a peculiar article known as spun silk is  manufactured, with which the English supply even the Paris and Lyons  weavers.  The weaving of the silk so twisted and spun is carried on in  Paisley and elsewhere in Scotland, and in Spitalfields, London, but also  in Manchester and elsewhere.  Nor is the gigantic advance achieved in  English manufacture since 1760 restricted to the production of clothing  materials.  The impulse, once given, was communicated to all branches of  industrial activity, and a multitude of inventions wholly unrelated to  those here cited, received double importance from the fact that they were  made in the midst of the universal movement.  But as soon as the  immeasurable importance of mechanical power was practically demonstrated,  every energy was concentrated in the effort to exploit this power in all  directions, and to exploit it in the interest of individual inventors and  manufacturers; and the demand for machinery, fuel, and materials called a  mass of workers and a number of trades into redoubled activity.  The  steam-engine first gave importance to the broad coal-fields of England;  the production of machinery began now for the first time, and with it  arose a new interest in the iron mines which supplied raw material for  it.  The increased consumption of wool stimulated English sheep breeding,  and the growing importation of wool, flax, and silk called forth an  extension of the British ocean carrying trade.  Greatest of all was the  growth of production of iron.  The rich iron deposits of the English  hills had hitherto been little developed; iron had always been smelted by  means of charcoal, which became gradually more expensive as agriculture  improved and forests were cut away.  The beginning of the use of coke in  iron smelting had been made in the last century, and in 1780 a new method  was invented of converting into available wrought-iron coke-smelted iron,  which up to that time had been convertible into cast-iron only.  This  process, known as \"puddling,\" consists in withdrawing the carbon which  had mixed with the iron during the process of smelting, and opened a  wholly new field for the production of English iron.  Smelting furnaces  were built fifty times larger than before, the process of smelting was  simplified by the introduction of hot blasts, and iron could thus be  produced so cheaply that a multitude of objects which had before been  made of stone or wood were now made of iron.    In 1788, Thomas Paine, the famous democrat, built in Yorkshire the first  iron bridge, which was followed by a great number of others, so that now  nearly all bridges, especially for railroad traffic, are built of cast-  iron, while in London itself a bridge across the Thames, the Southwark  bridge, has been built of this material.  Iron pillars, supports for  machinery, etc., are universally used, and since the introduction of gas-  lighting and railroads, new outlets for English iron products are opened.  Nails and screws gradually came to be made by machinery.  Huntsman, a  Sheffielder, discovered in 1790 a method for casting steel, by which much  labour was saved, and the production of wholly new cheap goods rendered  practicable; and through the greater purity of the material placed at its  disposal, and the more perfect tools, new machinery and minute division  of labour, the metal trade of England now first attained importance.  The  population of Birmingham grew from 73,000 in 1801 to 200,000 in 1844;  that of Sheffield from 46,000 in 1801 to 110,000 in 1844, and the  consumption of coal in the latter city alone reached in 1836, 515,000  tons.  In 1805 there were exported 4,300 tons of iron products and 4,600  tons of pig-iron; in 1834, 16,200 tons of iron products and 107,000 tons  of pig-iron, while the whole iron product reaching in 1740 but 17,000  tons, had risen in 1834 to nearly 700,000 tons.  The smelting of pig-iron  alone consumes yearly more than 3,000,000 tons of coal, and the  importance which coal mining has attained in the course of the last 60  years can scarcely be conceived.  All the English and Scotch deposits are  now worked, and the mines of Northumberland and Durham alone yield  annually "]]]
