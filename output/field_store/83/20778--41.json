The ride down had somewhat sharpened Jorrocks's appetite; and feeling,  as he said, quite ready for his dinner, he repaired to Mr. Morton's  house--a kind of sporting snuggery, everything in apple-pie order, and  very good--where he baited himself on sausages and salt herrings, a  basin of new milk, with some \"sticking powder\" as he called it, _alias_  rum, infused into it; and having deposited a half-quartern loaf in one  pocket, as a sort of balance against a huge bunch of keys which rattled  in the other, he pulled out his watch, and finding they had a quarter of  an hour to spare, proposed to chaperon the Yorkshireman on a tour of the  hunting stables. Jorrocks summoned the ostler, and with great dignity  led the way. \"Humph,\" said he, evidently disappointed at seeing half the  stalls empty, \"no great show this morning--pity--gentleman come from a  distance--should like to have shown him some good nags.--What sort of  a devil's this?\" \"Oh, sir, he's a good 'un, and nothing but a good  'un!--Leap! Lord love ye, he'll leap anything. A railway cut, a windmill  with the sails going, a navigable river with ships--anything in short.  This is the 'orse wot took the line of houses down at Beddington the day  they had the tremendious run from Reigate Hill.\" \"And wot's the grey in  the far stall?\" \"Oh, that's Mr. Pepper's old nag--Pepper-Caster as we  call him, since he threw the old gemman, the morning they met at the  'Leg-of-Mutton' at Ashtead. But he's good for nothing. Bless ye! his  tail shakes for all the world like a pepper-box afore he's gone half a  mile. Those be yours in the far stalls, and since they were turned round  I've won a bob of a gemman who I bet I'd show him two 'osses with their  heads vere their tails should be.[11] I always says,\" added he with a  leer, \"that you rides the best 'osses of any gemman vot comes to our  governor's.\" This flattered Jorrocks, and sidling up, he slipped a  shilling into his hand, saying, \"Well--bring them out, and let's see how  they look this morning.\" The stall reins are slipped, and out they step  with their hoods on their quarters. One was a large, fat, full-sized  chestnut, with a white ratch down the full extent of his face, a long  square tail, bushy mane, with untrimmed heels. The other was a brown,  about fifteen two, coarse-headed, with a rat-tail, and collar-marked.  The tackle was the same as they came down with. \"You'll do the trick on  that, I reckon,\" said Jorrocks, throwing his leg over the chestnut, and  looking askew at the Yorkshireman as he mounted. \"Tatt., and old Tatt.,  and Tatt. sen. before him, all agree that they never knew a bad 'oss  with a rat-tail.\"    [Footnote 11: A favourite joke among grooms when a horse is turned round  in his stall.]    \"But, let me tell you, you must be werry lively, if you mean to live  with our 'ounds. They go like the wind. But come! touch him with the  spur, and let's do a trot.\" The Yorkshireman obeyed, and getting into  the main street, onwards they jogged, right through Croydon, and struck  into a line of villas of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, which extend for  several miles along the road, exhibiting all sorts of architecture,  Gothic, Corinthian, Doric, Ionic, Dutch, and Chinese. These gradually  diminished in number, and at length they found themselves on an open  heath, within a few miles of the meet of the \"Surrey foxhounds\". \"Now\",  says Mr. Jorrocks, clawing up his smalls, \"you will see the werry finest  pack of hounds in all England; I don't care where the next best are; and  you will see as good a turn-out as ever you saw in your life, and as  nice a country to ride over as ever you were in\".    They reach the meet--a wayside public-house on a common, before which  the hounds with their attendants and some fifty or sixty horsemen, many  of them in scarlet, were assembled. Jorrocks was received with the  greatest cordiality, amid whoops and holloas, and cries of \"now  Twankay!--now Sugar!--now Figs!\" Waving his hand in token of  recognition, he passed on and made straight for Tom Hill, with a face  full of importance, and nearly rode over a hound in his hurry. \"Now,  Tom,\" said he, with the greatest energy, \"do, my good fellow, strain  every nerve to show sport to-day.--A gentleman has come all the way from  the north-east side of the town of Boroughbridge, in the county of York,  to see our excellent 'ounds, and I would fain have him galvanised.--Do  show us a run, and let it end with blood, so that he may have something  to tell the natives when he gets back to his own parts. That's him, see,  sitting under the yew-tree, in a bottle-green coat with basket buttons,  just striking a light on the pommel of his saddle to indulge in a  fumigation.--Keep your eye on him all day, and if you can lead him over  an awkward place, and get him a purl, so much the better.--If he'll risk  his neck I'll risk my 'oss's.\"    The Yorkshireman, having lighted his cigar and tightened his girths,  rode leisurely among the horsemen, many of whom were in eager council,  and a gentle breeze wafted divers scraps of conversation to his ear.    What is that hound got by? No. How is that horse bred? No. What sport  had you on Wednesday? No. Is it a likely find to-day? No, no, no; it was  not where the hounds, but what the Consols, left off at; what the four  per cents, and not the four horses, were up to; what the condition of  the money, not the horse, market. \"Anything doing in Danish bonds,  sir?\" said one. \"You must do it by lease and release, and levy a fine,\"  replied another. Scott _v._ Brown, crim. con. to be heard on or before  Wednesday next.--Barley thirty-two to forty-two.--Fine upland meadow  and rye grass hay, seventy to eighty.--The last pocket of hops I sold  brought seven pounds fifteen shillings. Sussex bags six pounds ten  shillings.--There were only twenty-eight and a quarter ships at market,  \"and coals are coals.\" \"Glad to hear it, sir, for half the last you sent  me were slates.\"--\"Best qualities of beef four shillings and eightpence  a stone--mutton three shillings and eightpence, to four shillings and  sixpence.--He was exceedingly ill when I paid my last visit--I gave him  nearly a stone of Epsom-salts, and bled him twice.--This horse would  suit you to a T, sir, but my skip-jack is coming out on one at two  o'clock that can carry a house.--See what a bosom this one's got.--Well,  Gunter, old boy, have you iced your horse to-day?--Have you heard that  Brown and Co. are in the _Gazette_? No, which Brown--not John Brown?  No, William Brown. What, Brown of Goodman's Fields? No, Brown of----  Street--Brown_e_ with an _e_; you know the man I mean.--Oh, Lord, ay,  the man wot used to be called Nosey Browne.\" A general move ensued, and  they left \"the meet.\"    \"Vere be you going to turn out pray, sir, may I inquire?\" said a  gentleman in green to the huntsman, as he turned into a field. \"Turn  out,\" said he, \"why, ye don't suppose we be come calf-hunting, do ye?  We throws off some two stones'-throw from here, if so be you mean what  cover we are going to draw.\" \"No,\" said green-coat, \"I mean where do  you turn out the stag?\"--\"D--n the stag, we know nothing about such  matters,\" replied the huntsman. \"Ware wheat! ware wheat! ware wheat!\"  was now the general cry, as a gentleman in nankeen pantaloons and  Hessian boots with long brass spurs, commenced a navigation across a  sprouting crop. \"Ware wheat, ware wheat!\" replied he, considering it  part of the ceremony of hunting, and continued his forward course. \"Come  to my side,\" said Mr.----, to the whipper-in, \"and meet that gentleman  as he arrives at yonder gate; and keep by him while I scold you.\"--\"Now,  sir, most particularly d--n you, for riding slap-dash over the young  wheat, you most confounded insensible ignorant tinker, isn't the  headland wide enough both for you and your horse, even if your spurs  were as long again as they are?\" Shouts of \"Yooi over, over, over  hounds--try for him--yoicks--wind him! good dogs--yoicks! stir him  up--have at him there!\"--here interrupted the jawbation, and the whip  rode off shaking his sides with laughter. \"Your horse has got a stone in  each forefoot, and a thorn in his near hock,\" observed a dentist to a  wholesale haberdasher from Ludgate Hill, \"allow me to extract them for  you--no pain, I assure--over before you know it.\" \"Come away, hounds!  come away!\" was heard, and presently the huntsman, with some of the pack  at his horse's heels, issued from the wood playing _Rule, Britannia!_  on a key-bugle, while the cracks of heavy-thonged whips warned the  stragglers and loiterers to follow. \"Music hath charms to soothe the  savage beast,\" observed Jorrocks, as he tucked the laps of his frock  over his thighs, \"and I hope we shall find before long, else that  quarter of house-lamb will be utterly ruined. Oh, dear, they are going  below hill I do believe! why we shall never get home to-day, and I told  Mrs. Jorrocks half-past five to a minute, and I invited old Fleecy, who  is a most punctual man.\"    Jorrocks was right in his surmise. They arrived on the summit of a  range of steep hills commanding an extensive view over the neighbouring  country--almost, he said, as far as the sea-coast. The huntsman and  hounds went down, but many of the field held a council of war on the  top. \"Well! who's going down?\" said one. \"I shall wait for the next  turn,\" said Jorrocks, \"for my horse does not like collar work.\" \"I shall  go this time,\" said another, \"and the rest next.\" \"And so will I,\"  said a third, \"for mayhap there will be no second turn.\" \"Ay,\" added a  fourth, \"and he may go the other way, and then where-shall we all be?\"  \"Poh!\" said Jorrocks, \"did you ever know a Surrey fox not take to the  hills?--If he does not, I'll eat him without mint sauce,\" again harping  on the quarter of lamb.

They had been implanted in me with great  care, and made an impression on my mind, which time could not erase,  and which all the adversity and variety of fortune I have since  experienced served only to rivet and record; for, whether the love of  one's country be real or imaginary, or a lesson of reason, or an  instinct of nature, I still look back with pleasure on the first  scenes of my life, though that pleasure has been for the most part  mingled with sorrow.    I have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my  birth. My father, besides many slaves, had a numerous family, of which  seven lived to grow up, including myself and a sister, who was the  only daughter. As I was the youngest of the sons, I became, of course,  the greatest favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and  she used to take particular pains to form my mind. I was trained up  from my earliest years in the art of war; my daily exercise was  shooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems,  after the manner of our greatest warriors. In this way I grew up till  I was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happiness in  the following manner:--Generally when the grown people in the  neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour, the children  assembled together in some of the neighbours' premises to play; and  commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any  assailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they sometimes  took those opportunities of our parents' absence to attack and carry  off as many as they could seize. One day, as I was watching at the top  of a tree in our yard, I saw one of those people come into the yard of  our next neighbour but one, to kidnap, there being many stout young  people in it. Immediately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and  he was surrounded by the stoutest of them, who entangled him with  cords, so that he could not escape till some of the grown people came  and secured him. But alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus  attacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were  nigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as  usual, and only I and my dear sister were left to mind the house, two  men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment seized us both,  and, without giving us time to cry out, or make resistance, they  stopped our mouths, and ran off with us into the nearest wood. Here  they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could,  till night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers  halted for refreshment, and spent the night. We were then unbound, but  were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue  and grief, our only relief was some sleep, which allayed our  misfortune for a short time. The next morning we left the house, and  continued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the  woods, but at last we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had  now some hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little  way before I discovered some people at a distance, on which I began to  cry out for their assistance: but my cries had no other effect than to  make them tie me faster and stop my mouth, and then they put me into a  large sack. They also stopped my sister's mouth, and tied her hands;  and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the sight of these  people. When we went to rest the following night they offered us some  victuals; but we refused it; and the only comfort we had was in being  in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our  tears. But alas! we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of  weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater sorrow than I  had yet experienced; for my sister and I were then separated, while we  lay clasped in each other's arms. It was in vain that we besought them  not to part us; she was torn from me, and immediately carried away,  while I was left in a state of distraction not to be described. I  cried and grieved continually; and for several days I did not eat any  thing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days  travelling, during which I had often changed masters, I got into the  hands of a chieftain, in a very pleasant country. This man had two  wives and some children, and they all used me extremely well, and did  all they could to comfort me; particularly the first wife, who was  something like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey  from my father's house, yet these people spoke exactly the same  language with us. This first master of mine, as I may call him, was a  smith, and my principal employment was working his bellows, which were  the same kind as I had seen in my vicinity. They were in some respects  not unlike the stoves here in gentlemen's kitchens; and were covered  over with leather; and in the middle of that leather a stick was  fixed, and a person stood up, and worked it, in the same manner as is  done to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump. I believe it was  gold he worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was  worn by the women on their wrists and ancles. I was there I suppose  about a month, and they at last used to trust me some little distance  from the house. This liberty I used in embracing every opportunity to  inquire the way to my own home: and I also sometimes, for the same  purpose, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring  pitchers of water from the springs for the use of the house. I had  also remarked where the sun rose in the morning, and set in the  evening, as I had travelled along; and I had observed that my father's  house was towards the rising of the sun. I therefore determined to  seize the first opportunity of making my escape, and to shape my  course for that quarter; for I was quite oppressed and weighed down by  grief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great,  was strengthened by the mortifying circumstance of not daring to eat  with the free-born children, although I was mostly their companion.  While I was projecting my escape, one day an unlucky event happened,  which quite disconcerted my plan, and put an end to my hopes. I used  to be sometimes employed in assisting an elderly woman slave to cook  and take care of the poultry; and one morning, while I was feeding  some chickens, I happened to toss a small pebble at one of them,  which hit it on the middle and directly killed it. The old slave,  having soon after missed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my  relating the accident (for I told her the truth, because my mother  would never suffer me to tell a lie) she flew into a violent passion,  threatened that I should suffer for it; and, my master being out, she  immediately went and told her mistress what I had done. This alarmed  me very much, and I expected an instant flogging, which to me was  uncommonly dreadful; for I had seldom been beaten at home. I therefore  resolved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard  by, and hid myself in the bushes. Soon afterwards my mistress and the  slave returned, and, not seeing me, they searched all the house, but  not finding me, and I not making answer when they called to me, they  thought I had run away, and the whole neighbourhood was raised in the  pursuit of me. In that part of the country (as in ours) the houses and  villages were skirted with woods, or shrubberies, and the bushes were  so thick that a man could readily conceal himself in them, so as to  elude the strictest search. The neighbours continued the whole day  looking for me, and several times many of them came within a few yards  of the place where I lay hid. I then gave myself up for lost entirely,  and expected every moment, when I heard a rustling among the trees, to  be found out, and punished by my master: but they never discovered me,  though they were often so near that I even heard their conjectures as  they were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any  attempt to return home would be hopeless. Most of them supposed I had  fled towards home; but the distance was so great, and the way so  intricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I should  be lost in the woods. When I heard this I was seized with a violent  panic, and abandoned myself to despair. Night too began to approach,  and aggravated all my fears. I had before entertained hopes of getting  home, and I had determined when it should be dark to make the attempt;  but I was now convinced it was fruitless, and I began to consider  that, if possibly I could escape all other animals, I could not those  of the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I must perish in the  woods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:        --\"Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whisp'ring breath      Convey'd a foe, and ev'ry foe a death.\"    I heard frequent rustlings among the leaves; and being pretty sure  they were snakes I expected every instant to be stung by them. This  increased my anguish, and the horror of my situation became now quite  insupportable. I at length quitted the thicket, very faint and hungry,  for I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day; and crept to my  master's kitchen, from whence I set out at first, and which was an  open shed, and laid myself down in the ashes with an anxious wish for  death to relieve me from all my pains. I was scarcely awake in the  morning when the old woman slave, who was the first up, came to light  the fire, and saw me in the fire place. She was very much surprised to  see me, and could scarcely believe her own eyes. She now promised to  intercede for me, and went for her master, who soon after came, and,  having slightly reprimanded me, ordered me to be taken care of, and  not to be ill-treated.    Soon after this my"]]]
