And I will thrust thee from thy office, and from thy  station he shall pull thee down!\"** Meanwhile, day after day elapsed,  and Pharaoh did not hasten to the rescue. Hezekiah's eyes were opened;  he dismissed Shebna, and degraded him to the position of scribe, and set  Eliakim in his place in the Council of State.***         * Isa. xxii. 1-14.         ** Isa. xxii. 15-19.         ***In the duplicate narrative of these negotiations with the       Assyrian generals, Shebna is in fact considered as a mere       scribe, while Eliakim is the prefect of the king's house (2       Kings xviii. 18, 37; xix. 2: Isa. xxxvi. 3, 22; xxxvii. 2).    Isaiah's influence revived, and he persuaded the king to sue for peace  while yet there was time.    Sennacherib was encamped at Lachish; but the Tartan and his two  lieutenants received the overtures of peace, and proposed a parley near  the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field.  Hezekiah did not venture to go in person to the meeting-place; he sent  Eliakirn, the new prefect of the palace, Shebna, and the chancellor  Joah, the chief cupbearer, and tradition relates that the Assyrian  addressed them in severe terms in his master's name: \"Now on whom dost  thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? Behold, thou trustest upon  the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean,  it will go into his hand and pierce it: so is Pharaoh, King of Egypt,  to all that trust on him.\" Then, as he continued to declaim in a loud  voice, so that the crowds gathered on the wall could hear him, the  delegates besought him to speak in Aramaic, which they understood, but  \"speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that  are on the wall!\" Instead, however, of granting their request, the  Assyrian general advanced towards the spectators and addressed them in  Hebrew: \"Hear ye the words of the great king, the King of Assyria.  Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be able to deliver you:  neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will  surely deliver us: this city shall not be given into the hand of the  King of Assyria. Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the King of  Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every  one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one  the waters of his own cistern; until I come and take you away to a  land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and  vineyards. Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The Lord will  deliver us!\" The specified conditions were less hard than might have  been feared.*         * The Hebrew version of these events is recorded in 2 Kings       xviii. 13-37; xix., and in Isa. xxxvi., xxxvii., with only       one important divergence, namely, the absence from Isaiah of       verses 14-16 of 2 Kings xviii. This particular passage, in       which the name of the king has a peculiar form, is a       detached fragment of an older document, perhaps the official       annals of the kingdom, whose contents agreed with the facts       recorded in the Assyrian text. The rest is borrowed from the       cycle of prophetic narratives, and contains two different       versions of the same events. The first comprises 2 Kings       xviii. 13, 17-37; xix. l-9a, 36&-37, where Sennacherib is       represented as despatching a verbal message to Hezekiah by       the Tartan and his captains. The second consists merely of 2       Kings xix. 96-36a, and in this has been inserted a long       prophecy of Isaiah's (xix. 21-31) which has but a vague       connection with the rest of the narrative. In this       Sennacherib defied Hezekiah in a letter, which the Jewish       king spread before the Lord, and shortly afterwards received       a reply through the prophet. The two versions were combined       towards the end of the seventh or beginning of the sixth       century, by the compiler of the _Book of Kings_, and passed       thence into the collection of the prophecies attributed to       Isaiah.    The Jewish king was to give up his wives and daughters as hostages,  to pledge himself to pay a regular tribute, and disburse immediately a  ransom of thirty talents of gold, and eight hundred talents of silver:  he could only make up this large sum by emptying the royal and sacred  treasuries, and taking down the plates of gold with which merely a short  while before he had adorned the doors and lintels of the temple. Padi  was released from his long captivity, reseated on his throne, and  received several Jewish towns as an indemnity: other portions of  territory were bestowed upon Mitinti of Ashdod and Zillibel of Graza as  a reward for their loyalty.*         * The sequence of events is not very well observed in the       Assyrian text, and the liberation of Padi is inserted in 11.       8-11, before the account of the war with Hezekiah. It seems       very unlikely that the King of Judah would have released his       prisoner before his treaty with Sennacherib; the Assyrian       scribe, wishing to bring together all the facts relating to       Ekron, anticipated this event. Hebrew tradition fixed the       ransom at the lowest figure, 300 talents of silver instead       of the 800 given in the Assyrian document (2 Kings xviii.       14), and authorities have tried to reconcile this divergence       by speculating on the different values represented by a       talent in different countries and epochs.    Hezekiah issued from the struggle with his territory curtailed and his  kingdom devastated; the last obstacle which stood in the way of the  Assyrians' victorious advance fell with him, and Sennacherib could  now push forward with perfect safety towards the Nile. He had, indeed,  already planned an attack on Egypt, and had reached the isthmus, when a  mysterious accident arrested his further progress. The conflict on  the plains of Altaku had been severe; and the army, already seriously  diminished by its victory, had been still further weakened during the  campaign in Judaea, and possibly the excesses indulged in by the soldiery  had developed in them the germs of one of those terrible epidemics which  had devastated Western Asia several times in the course of the century:  whatever may have been the cause, half the army was destroyed by  pestilence before it reached the frontier of the Delta, and Sennacherib  led back the shattered remnants of his force to Nineveh.*         * The Assyrian texts are silent about this catastrophe, and       the sacred books of the Hebrews seem to refer it to the camp       at Libnah in Palestine (2 Kings xix. 8-35); the Egyptian       legend related by Herodotus seems to prove that it took       place near the Egyptian frontier. Josephus takes the king as       far as Pelusium, and describes the destruction of the       Assyrian army as taking place in the camp before this town.       He may have been misled by the meaning \"mud,\" which attaches       to the name of Libnah as well as to that of Pelusium. Oppert       upheld his opinion, and identified the Libnah of the       biblical narrative with the Pelusium of Herodotus. It is       probable that each of the two nations referred the scene of       the miracle to a different locality.    The Hebrews did not hesitate to ascribe the event to the vengeance of  Jahveh, and to make it a subject of thankfulness. They related that  before their brutal conqueror quitted the country he had sent a parting  message to Hezekiah: \"Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive  thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the King of  Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to  all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? Have  the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed,  Gozan and Haran and Rezepk, and the children of Eden which were in  Telassar? Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the  King of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?\" Hezekiah, having  received this letter of defiance, laid it in the temple before Jahveh,  and prostrated himself in prayer: the response came to him through the  mouth of Isaiah. \"Thus saith the Lord concerning the King of Assyria, He  shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall  he come before it with a shield, nor cast a mount against it. By the way  that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto  this city, saith the Lord. For I will defend this city to save it, for  Mine own sake and for My servant David's sake. And it came to pass that  night, that the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp  of the Assyrians an hundred four-score and five thousand: and when men  arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.\"*         * 2 Kings xix. 8-35; Isa. xxxvii. 8-36; this is the second       tradition of which mention has been made, but already       amalgamated with the first to form the narrative as it now       stands.    The Egyptians considered the event no less miraculous than did the  Hebrews, and one of their popular tales ascribed the prodigy to Phtah,  the god of Memphis. Sethon, the high priest of Phtah, lived in a time of  national distress, and the warrior class, whom he had deprived of some  of its privileges, refused to take up arms in his behalf. He repaired,  therefore, to the temple to implore divine assistance, and, falling  asleep, was visited by a dream. The god appeared to him, and promised  to send him some auxiliaries who should ensure him success. He enlisted  such of the Egyptians as were willing to follow him, shopkeepers,  fullers, and sutlers, and led them to Pelusium to resist the threatened"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"t-hall, the soul arrived at the approach to the bridge  Cinvaut, which, thrown across the abyss of hell, led to paradise. The  soul, if impious, was unable to cross this bridge, but was hurled down  into the abyss, where it became the slave of Angro-mainyus. If pure, it  crossed the bridge without difficulty by the help of the angel Sraosha,  and was welcomed by Vohu-mano, who conducted it before the throne of  Ahura-mazda, in the same way as he had led Zoroaster, and assigned to it  the post which it should occupy until the day of the resurrection of the  body.*         * All this picture of the fate of the soul is taken from the       _Vendidad_, where the fate of the just is described, and in       the _Yasht_, where the condition of faithful and impious       souls respectively is set forth on parallel lines. The       classical authors teach us nothing on this subject, and the       little they actually say only proves that the Persians       believed in the immortality of the soul. The main outlines       of the picture here set forth go back to the times of the       Achaemenids and the Medes, except the abstract conception of       the goddess who leads the soul of the dead as an incarnation       of his good or evil deeds.    The religious observances enjoined on the members of the priestly caste  were innumerable and minute. Ahura-mazda and his colleagues had not,  as was the fashion among the Assyrians and Egyptians, either temples or  tabernacles, and though they were represented sometimes under human or  animal forms, and even in some cases on bas-reliefs, yet no one ever  ventured to set up in their sanctuaries those so-called animated or  prophetic statues to which the majority of the nations had rendered or  were rendering their solicitous homage. Altars, however, were erected  on the tops of hills, in palaces, or in the centre of cities, on which  fires were kindled in honour of the inferior deities or of the supreme  god himself.    [Illustration: 031.jpg THE TWO IRANIAN ALTAKRAT NAKHSH-I-RUSTEM]         Drawn by Boudier, from a heliogravure in Marcel Dieulafoy.    Two altars were usually set up together, and they are thus found here  and there among the ruins, as at Nakhsh-i-Kustem, the necropolis of  Persepolis, where a pair of such altars exist; these are cut, each out  of a single block, in a rocky mass which rises some thirteen feet above  the level of the surrounding plain. They are of cubic form and  squat appearance, looking like towers flanked at the four corners by  supporting columns which are connected by circular arches; above a  narrow moulding rises a crest of somewhat triangular projections; the  hearth is hollowed out on the summit of each altar.*         * According to Perrot and Chipiez, \"it is not impossible       that these altars were older than the great buildings of       Persepolis, and that they were erected for the old Persian       town which Darius raised to the position of capital.\"    At Meshed-i-Murgab, on the site of the ancient Pasargadas, the altars  have disappeared, but the basements on which they were erected are  still visible, as also the flight of eight steps by which they were  approached. Those altars on which burned, a perpetual fire were not  left exposed to the open air: they would have run too great a risk  of contracting impurities, such as dust borne by the wind, flights of  birds, dew, rain, or snow. They were enclosed in slight structures, well  protected by walls, and attaining in some cases considerable dimensions,  or in pavilion-shaped edifices of stone adorned with columns.    [Illustration: 032.jpg THE TWO IRANIAN ALTARS OF MURGAB]         Drawn by Boudier, from Plandin and Coste.    The sacrificial rites were of long duration, and frequent, and were  rendered very complex by interminable manual acts, ceremonial gestures,  and incantations.    [Illustration: 032b.jpg THE OCCUPATIONS OF ANI IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS]    In cases where the altar was not devoted to maintaining a perpetual  fire, it was kindled when necessary with small twigs previously barked  and purified, and was subsequently fed with precious woods, preferably  cypress or laurel;* care was taken not to quicken the flame by blowing,  for the human breath would have desecrated the fire by merely passing  over it; death was the punishment for any one who voluntarily committed  such a heinous sacrilege. The recognised offering consisted of flowers,  bread, fruit, and perfumes, but these were often accompanied, as in all  ancient religions, by a bloody sacrifice; the sacrifice of a horse was  considered the most efficacious, but an ox, a cow, a sheep, a camel,  an ass, or a stag was frequently offered: in certain circumstances,  especially when it was desired to conciliate the favour of the god of  the underworld, a human victim, probably as a survival of very ancient  rites was preferred.**         * Pausanias, who witnessed the cult as practised at       Hierocaesarsea, remarked the curious colour of the ashes       heaped upon the altar.         * Most modern writers deny the authenticity of Herodotus'       account, because a sacrifice of this kind is opposed to the       spirit of the Magian religion, which is undoubtedly the       case, as far as the latest form of the religion is       concerned; but the testimony of Herodotus is so plain that       the fact itself must be considered as indisputable. We may       note that the passage refers to the foundation of a city;       and if we remember how persistent was the custom of human       sacrifice among ancient races at the foundation of       buildings, we shall be led to the conclusion that the       ceremony described by the Greek historian was a survival of       a very ancient usage, which had not yet fallen entirely into       desuetude at the Achaemenian epoch.    [Illustration: 033.jpg THE SACRED FIRE BURNING ON THE ALTAR]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the impression of a Persian       intaglio.    The king, whose royal position made him the representative of  Ahura-mazda on earth, was, in fact, a high priest, and was himself  able to officiate at the altar, but no one else could dispense with the  mediation of the Magi. The worshippers proceeded in solemn procession  to the spot where the ceremony was to take place, and there the priest,  wearing the tiara on his head, recited an invocation in a slow and  mysterious voice, and implored the blessings of heaven on the king  and nation. He then slaughtered the victim by a blow on the head, and  divided it into portions, which he gave back to the offerer without  reserving any of them, for Ahura-mazda required nothing but the soul;  in certain cases, the victim was entirely consumed by fire, but more  frequently nothing but a little of the fat and some of the entrails  were taken to feed and maintain the flame, and sometimes even this was  omitted.* Sacrifices were of frequent occurrence. Without mentioning  the extraordinary occasions on which a king would have a thousand bulls  slain at one time,** the Achaemenian kings killed each day a thousand  bullocks, asses, and stags: sacrifice under such circumstances was  another name for butchery, the object of which was to furnish the court  with a sufficient supply of pure meat. The ceremonial bore resemblance  in many ways to that still employed by the modern Zoroastrians of Persia  and India.         * A relic of this custom may be discerned in the expiatory       sacrifice decreed in the _Vendidad_: \"He shall sacrifice a       thousand head of small cattle, and he shall place their       entrails devoutly on the fire, with libations.\"         ** The number 1000 seems to have had some ritualistic       significance, for it often recurs in the penances imposed on       the faithful as expiation for their sins: thus it was       enjoined to slay 1000 serpents, 1000 frogs, 1000 ants who       steal the grain, 1000 head of small cattle, 1000 swift       horses, 1000 camels, 1000 brown oxen.    The officiating priest covered his mouth with the bands which fell from  his mitre, to prevent the god from being polluted by his breath; he held  in his hand the baresman, or sacred bunch of tamarisk, and prepared the  mysterious liquor from the haoma plant.* He was accustomed each morning  to celebrate divine service before the sacred fire, not to speak of the  periodic festivals in which he shared the offices with all the members  of his tribe, such as the feast of Mithra, the feast of the Fravashis,**  the feast commemorating the rout of Angro-mainyus,*** the feast of the  Saksea, during which the slaves were masters of the house.****         * The drink mentioned by the author of the _De Iside_, which       was extracted from the plant Omomi, and which the Magi       offered to the god of the underworld, is certainly the       haoma. The rite mentioned by the Greek author, which appears       to be an incantation against Ahriman, required, it seems, a       potion in which the blood of a wolf was a necessary       ingredient: this questionable draught was then carried to a       place where the sun's rays never shone, and was there       sprinkled on the ground as a libation.         ** Menander speaks of this festival as conducted in his own       times, and tells us that it was called Eurdigan; modern       authorities usually admit that it goes back to the times of       the Achaemenids or even beyond.         *** Agathias says that every worshipper of Ahura-mazda is       enjoined to kill the greatest possible number of animals       created by Angro-mainyus, and bring to the Magi the fruits       of his hunting. Herodotus had already spoken of this       destruction of life as one of the duties incumbent on every       Persian, and this gives probability to the view of modern       writers that the festival went back to the Achaemenian epoch.         **** The festival of the Sakoa is mentioned by Ctesias.
