[Footnote 1: Apparent omission.]    The German Government venture to hope that the agreement for which the  American Government have paved the way may be reached after due  consideration of the remarks made above, and that in this way peaceable  neutral shipping and trade will not have to suffer any more than is  absolutely necessary from the unavoidable effects of maritime war. These  effects could be still further reduced if, as was pointed out in the  German note of the 16th inst., some way could be found to exclude the  shipping of munitions of war from neutral countries to belligerents on  ships of any nationality.    The German Government must, of course, reserve a definite statement of  their position until such time as they may receive further information  from the American Government enabling them to see what obligations the  British Government are, on their part, willing to assume.    The undersigned avails himself of this occasion, &c.    VON JAGOW.    Dated, Foreign Office, Berlin, Feb. 28, 1915.    GERARD.      III.    GREAT BRITAIN'S REPLY.    _The reply of Great Britain to the American note of Feb. 20, handed to  the American Ambassador at London, was as follows:_    LONDON, March 15, 1915.    Following is the full text of a memorandum dated March 13, which Grey  handed me today:    \"On the 22d of February last I received a communication from your  Excellency of the identic note addressed to his Majesty's Government and  to Germany respecting an agreement on certain points as to the conduct  of the war at sea. The reply of the German Government to this note has  been published and it is not understood from the reply that the German  Government are prepared to abandon the practice of sinking British  merchant vessels by submarines, and it is evident from their reply that  they will not abandon the use of mines for offensive purposes on the  high seas as contrasted with the use of mines for defensive purposes  only within cannon range of their own harbors, as suggested by the  Government of the United States. This being so, it might appear  unnecessary for the British Government to make any further reply than to  take note of the German answer.    \"We desire, however, to take the opportunity of making a fuller  statement of the whole position and of our feeling with regard to it. We  recognize with sympathy the desire of the Government of the United  States to see the European war conducted in accordance with the  previously recognized rules of international law and the dictates of  humanity. It is thus that the British forces have conducted the war, and  we are not aware that these forces, either naval or military, can have  laid to their charge any improper proceedings, either in the conduct of  hostilities or in the treatment of prisoners or wounded. On the German  side it has been very different.    \"1. The treatment of civilian inhabitants in Belgium and the North of  France has been made public by the Belgian and French Governments and by  those who have had experience of it at first hand. Modern history  affords no precedent for the sufferings that have been inflicted on the  defenseless and non-combatant population in the territory that has been  in German military occupation. Even the food of the population was  confiscated until in Belgium an international commission, largely  influenced by American generosity and conducted under American auspices,  came to the relief of the population and secured from the German  Government a promise to spare what food was still left in the country,  though the Germans still continue to make levies in money upon the  defenseless population for the support of the German Army.    \"2. We have from time to time received most terrible accounts of the  barbarous treatment to which British officers and soldiers have been  exposed after they have been taken prisoner, while being conveyed to  German prison camps. One or two instances have already been given to the  United States Government founded upon authentic and first-hand evidence  which is beyond doubt. Some evidence has been received of the hardships  to which British prisoners of war are subjected in the prison camps,  contrasting, we believe, most unfavorably with the treatment of German  prisoners in this country. We have proposed, with the consent of the  United States Government, that a commission of United States officers  should be permitted in each country to inspect the treatment of  prisoners of war. The United States Government have been unable to  obtain any reply from the German Government to this proposal, and we  remain in continuing anxiety and apprehension as to the treatment of  British prisoners of war in Germany.    \"3. At the very outset of the war a German mine layer was discovered  laying a mine field on the high seas. Further mine fields have been laid  from time to time without warning, and, so far as we know, are still  being laid on the high seas, and many neutral as well as British vessels  have been sunk by them.    \"4. At various times during the war German submarines have stopped and  sunk British merchant vessels, thus making the sinking of merchant  vessels a general practice, though it was admitted previously, if at  all, only as an exception, the general rule to which the British  Government have adhered being that merchant vessels, if captured, must  be taken before a prize court. In one case already quoted in a note to  the United States Government a neutral vessel carrying foodstuffs to an  unfortified town in Great Britain has been sunk. Another case is now  reported in which a German armed cruiser has sunk an American vessel,  the William P. Frye, carrying a cargo of wheat from Seattle to  Queenstown. In both cases the cargoes were presumably destined for the  civil population. Even the cargoes in such circumstances should not have  been condemned without the decision of a prize court, much less should  the vessels have been sunk. It is to be noted that both these cases  occurred before the detention by the British authorities of the  Wilhelmina and her cargo of foodstuffs, which the German Government  allege is the justification for their own action.    \"The Germans have announced their intention of sinking British merchant  vessels by torpedo without notice and without any provision for the  safety of the crews. They have already carried out this intention in the  case of neutral as well as of British vessels, and a number of  non-combatant and innocent lives on British vessels, unarmed and  defenseless, have been destroyed in this way.    \"5. Unfortified, open, and defenseless towns, such as Scarborough,  Yarmouth, and Whitby, have been deliberately and wantonly bombarded by  German ships of war, causing in some cases considerable loss of civilian  life, including women and children.    \"6. German aircraft have dropped bombs on the east coast of England,  where there were no military or strategic points to be attacked. On the  other hand, I am aware of but two criticisms that have been made on  British action in all these respects:    \"1. It is said that the British naval authorities also have laid some  anchored mines on the high seas. They have done so, but the mines were  anchored and so constructed that they would be harmless if they went  adrift, and no mines whatever were laid by the British naval authorities  till many weeks after the Germans had made a regular practice of laying  mines on the high seas.    \"2. It is said that the British Government have departed from the view  of international law which they had previously maintained, that  foodstuffs destined for the civil population should never be interfered  with, this charge being founded on the submission to a prize court of  the cargo of the Wilhelmina. The special considerations affecting this  cargo have already been presented in a memorandum to the United States  Government, and I need not repeat them here.    \"Inasmuch as the blockade of all foodstuffs is an admitted consequence  of blockade, it is obvious that there can be no universal rule based on  considerations of morality and humanity which is contrary to this  practice. The right to stop foodstuffs destined for the civil population  must therefore in any case be admitted if an effective 'cordon'  controlling intercourse with the enemy is drawn, announced, and  maintained. Moreover, independently of rights arising from belligerent  action in the nature of blockade, some other nations, differing from the  opinion of the Governments of the United States and Great Britain, have  held that to stop the food of the civil population is a natural and  legitimate method of bringing pressure to bear on an enemy country as it  is upon the defense of a besieged town. It is also upheld on the  authority of both Prince Bismarck and Count Caprivi, and therefore  presumably is not repugnant to German morality.    \"The following are the quotations from Prince Bismarck and Count Caprivi  on this point. Prince Bismarck in answering, in 1885, an application  from the Kiel Chamber of Commerce for a statement of the view of the  German Government on the question of the right to declare as contraband  foodstuffs that were not intended for military forces said: 'I reply to  the Chamber of Commerce that any disadvantage our commercial and  carrying interests may suffer by the treatment of rice as contraband of  war does not justify our opposing a measure which it has been thought  fit to take in carrying on a foreign war. Every war is a calamity which  entails evil consequences not only on the combatants but also on  neutrals. These evils may easily be increased by the interference of a  neutral power with the way in which a third carries on the war to the  disadvantage of the subjects of the interfering power, and by this means  German commerce might be weighted with far heavier losses than a  transitory prohibition of the rice trade in Chinese waters."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#6)"],[1,"of time.  The result for them was terrible, owing to the excellent marksmanship  from the Turkish batteries. The Allies fired on this day 2,000 shells  without silencing one shore battery. The result has inspired the Turks  with confidence, and they are looking forward to further engagements  with calm assurance.      ELIMINATION OF MINES.    _The London Times naval correspondent writes, in its issue of March 20:_    The further attack upon the inner forts at the Dardanelles, which was  resumed by the allied squadrons on Thursday, has resulted,  unfortunately, but not altogether unexpectedly, in some loss of ships  and gallant lives.    The clear and candid dispatch in which the operations are described  attributes the loss of the ships to floating mines, which were probably  released to drift down with the current in such large numbers that the  usual method of evading these machines was unavailable. This danger, it  is said, will require special treatment. Presumably the area having been  swept clear of anchored mines, it was not considered necessary to take  other precautions than such as were concerned with the movement of the  battleships themselves.    The satisfactory feature of the operations is that the ships maintained  their superiority over the forts, and succeeded in silencing them after  a few hours' bombardment. The sinking of the battleships occurred later  in the afternoon, and it would seem at a time when a portion of the  naval force was making a further advance to cover the mine-sweeping  operations. There is nothing in the dispatch which indicates anything  but the eventual success of the work, nor that the defenses have proved  more formidable than was anticipated. The danger from floating mines may  have been somewhat underestimated, but it is one that can be met and is  most unlikely to form a decisive factor.    Manifestly the Turks, with their German advisers, have done their utmost  to repair, by means of howitzers and field guns, the destruction of the  fixed defenses; but it is not likely that any temporary expedients will  prove more than troublesome to the passage of the fleet. The  determination of the Allies to make a satisfactory ending of the  operations is shown by the immediate dispatch of reinforcing ships, and  by the fact that ample naval and military forces are available on the  spot.    Every one will regret that illness has obliged Vice Admiral Carden to  relinquish the chief command, but this is now in the very capable hands  of Vice Admiral Robeck.      BRITISH OFFICIAL REPORT.    [From The London Times, March 20, 1915.]    _After ten days of mine-sweeping inside the Dardanelles the British and  French fleets made a general attack on the fortresses at the Narrows on  Thursday. After about three hours' bombardment all the forts ceased  firing._    _Three battleships were lost in these operations by striking mines--the  French Bouvet, and the Irresistible and the Ocean. The British crews  were practically all saved, but nearly the whole of the men on the  Bouvet perished._    _The Secretary of the Admiralty issued the following statement last  night:_    Mine-sweeping having been in progress during the last ten days inside  the strait, a general attack was delivered by the British and French  fleets yesterday morning upon the fortresses at the Narrows of the  Dardanelles.    At 10:45 A.M. Queen Elizabeth, Inflexible, Agamemnon, and Lord Nelson  bombarded Forts J, L, T, U, and V; while Triumph and Prince George fired  at Batteries F, E, and H. A heavy fire was opened on the ships from  howitzers and field guns.    At 12:22 the French squadron, consisting of the Suffren, Gaulois,  Charlemagne, and Bouvet, advanced up the Dardanelles to engage the forts  at closer range. Forts J, U, F, and E replied strongly. Their fire was  silenced by the ten battleships inside the strait, all the ships being  hit several times during this part of the action.    By 1:25 P.M. all forts had ceased firing.    Vengeance, Irresistible, Albion, Ocean, Swiftsure, and Majestic then  advanced to relieve the six old battleships inside the strait.    As the French squadron, which had engaged the forts in the most  brilliant fashion was passing out, Bouvet was blown up by a drifting  mine and sank in thirty-six fathoms north Erenkeui Village in less than  three minutes.    At 2:36 P.M., the relief battleships renewed the attack on the forts,  which again opened fire. The attack on the forts was maintained while  the operations of the mine-sweepers continued. At 4:09 Irresistible  quitted the line, listing heavily; and at 5:50 she sank, having probably  struck a drifting mine. At 6:05, Ocean, also having struck a mine, both  vessels sank in deep water, practically the whole of the crews having  been removed safely under a hot fire.    [Illustration: QUEEN MARY    Wife of George V., King of Great Britain and Ireland.    _(Photo from Underwood & Underwood.)_]    [Illustration: THE RIGHT HON. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE    The radical Chancellor of the British Exchequer, upon whom has devolved  the task of financing the great war.    _(Photo by A. & R. Annan & Sons.)_]    The Gaulois was damaged by gun fire.    Inflexible had her forward control position hit by a heavy shell, and  requires repair.    The bombardment of the forts and the mine-sweeping operations terminated  when darkness fell. The damage to the forts effected by the prolonged  direct fire of the very powerful forces employed cannot yet be  estimated, and a further report will follow.    The losses of ships were caused by mines drifting with the current which  were encountered in areas hitherto swept clear, and this danger will  require special treatment.    The British casualties in personnel are not heavy, considering the scale  of the operations; but practically the whole of the crew of the Bouvet  were lost with the ship, an internal explosion having apparently  supervened on the explosion of the mine.    The Queen and Implacable, which were dispatched from England to replace  ships' casualties in anticipation of this operation, are due to arrive  immediately, thus bringing the British fleet up to its original  strength.    The operations are continuing, ample naval and military forces being  available on the spot.    On the 16th inst., Vice Admiral Carden, who has been incapacitated by  illness, was succeeded in the chief command by Rear Admiral John Michael  de Robeck, with acting rank of Vice Admiral.      THE SCENE IN THE STRAIT.    _The London Times publishes this story of an eyewitness:_    TENEDOS, (Aegina,) March 18.    This is not so much an account of the five hours' heavy engagement  between the Turkish forts and the allied ships which has been fought  actually within the Dardanelles today as an impression of the  bombardment as seen at a distance of fifteen miles or so from the top of  a high, steep hill called Mount St. Elias, at the northern end of  Tenedos.    Over the ridge of Kum Kale you plainly see, like a great blue lake, the  first reach of the Dardanelles up to the narrow neck between Chanak and  Kilid Bahr. It was up and down in this stretch of water that the largest  vessels of the allied fleet steamed today for over four hours, hurling,  with sheets of orange flame from their heavy guns, a constant succession  of shells on the forts that guard the Narrows at Chanak, while the  Turkish batteries, with a frequency that lessened as the day went on,  flashed back at them in reply, with the difference that, while the  effects of the Allies' shells were continually manifest in the columns  of smoke and dust that were signs of the damage they had wrought, a  great number of the enemy's shots fell in the sea hundreds of yards from  the bombarding ships, sending torrents of water towering harmlessly into  the air.    Not that the successes of the day have been won without cost. I saw  several ships, French and British, struck by shells that raised volumes  of white smoke, and one of the French squadron is toiling slowly home at  this moment down by the head and with a list to port, while, so far as  one could make out with a glass, several boatloads of men were being  taken off her.    The ships left their stations between the Turkish and Asiatic coasts and  Tenedos early this morning and by 11 they were steaming in line up the  Dardanelles.    It was 11:45 when the first notable hit was made by an English ship. I  could see eight vessels, apparently all battleships, lying in line from  the entrance up the strait. The ship furthest up appeared to be the  Queen Elizabeth, and I think it was she that fired the shot which  exploded the powder magazine at Chanak. A great balloon of white smoke  sprang up in the midst of the magazine which leaped out from a fierce,  red flame, and reached a great height. When the flame had disappeared  the dense smoke continued to grow till it must have been a column  hundreds of feet high.    [Illustration: [map of the Dardanelles]]    In the five minutes that followed this shot three more shells from the  Queen Elizabeth fell practically on the same spot, and two minutes later  yet another by the side of the smoking ruins.    There were now eight battleships, all pre-dreadnoughts, left at Tenedos,  and at noon six of them started off in line a-head toward the strait.  The English ships already within were passing further up and went out of  sight.    The bombarding ships were steaming constantly up and down, turning at  each end of the stretch, which is about a couple of miles long.    A long thin veil of black smoke was drifting slowly westward from the  fighting. At about 1:30 Erenkeui Village, standing high on the Asiatic  side, received a couple of shells. At 1:45 a division of eight  destroyers in line steamed into the entrance of the strait, and a little  later the last two battleships from Tenedos joined, the Dublin  patrolling outside. An hour later the most striking effect was"]]]
