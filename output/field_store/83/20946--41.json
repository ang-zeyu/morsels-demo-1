I shall be happier for  having my mind and my hands occupied.\"    \"What work will you do?\"    \"I don't know yet. Dodger will advise me.\"    \"Who, miss?\"    \"Dodger.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"It's the boy I spoke of.\"    \"Shure, he's got a quare name.\"    \"Yes; but names don't count for much. It's the heart I think of, and  this boy has a kind heart.\"    \"Have you known him long?\"    \"I saw him yesterday for the first time.\"    \"Is it the young fellow who was here last night?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"He isn't fit company for the likes of you, Miss Florence.\"    \"You forget, Jane, that I am no longer a rich young lady. I am poorer  than even you. This Dodger is kind, and I feel that I can trust him.\"    \"If you are poor, Miss Florence,\" said Jane, hesitatingly, \"would you  mind borrowing some money of me? I've got ten dollars upstairs in my  trunk, and I don't need it at all. It's proud I'll be to lend it to  you.\"    \"Thank you, Jane,\" said Florence, gratefully. \"I thought I had but one  friend. I find I have two----\"    \"Then you'll take the money? I'll go right up and get it.\"    \"No, Jane; not at present. I have twenty dollars in my purse, and it  will last me till I can earn more.\"    \"But, miss, twenty dollars will soon go,\" said Jane, disappointed.    \"If I find that I need the sum you so kindly offer me, I will let you  know, I promise that.\"    \"Thank you, miss.\"    At this point a bell rang from above.    \"It's from Mr. Curtis' room,\" said Jane.    \"Go and see what he wants.\"    Jane returned in a brief time with a note in her hand.    \"Mr. Curtis asked me if you were still here,\" she explained, \"and when  I told him you were he asked me to give you this.\"    Florence took the note, and, opening it, read these lines:        \"Florence: Now that you have had time to think over your plan      of leaving your old home, I hope you have come to see how      foolish it is. Reflect that, if carried out, a life of      poverty and squalid wretchedness amid homely and uncongenial      surroundings awaits you; while, as my wife, you will live a      life of luxury and high social position. There are many young      ladies who would be glad to accept the chance which you so      recklessly reject. By accepting my hand you will gratify our      excellent uncle, and make me the happiest of mortals. You      will acquit me of mercenary motives, since you are now      penniless, and your disobedience leaves me sole heir to Uncle      John. I love you, and it will be my chief object, if you will      permit it, to make you happy.                                                     \"Curtis Waring.\"    Florence ran her eyes rapidly over this note, but her heart did not  respond, and her resolution was not shaken.    \"Tell Mr. Waring there is no answer, Jane, if he inquires,\" she said.    \"Was he tryin' to wheedle you into marryin' him?\" asked Jane.    \"He wished me to change my decision.\"    \"I'm glad you've given him the bounce,\" said Jane, whose expressions  were not always refined. \"I wouldn't marry him myself.\"    Florence smiled. Jane was red haired, and her nose was what is  euphemistically called _retrousse_. Even in her own circles she was  not regarded as beautiful, and was hardly likely to lead a rich man to  overlook her humble station, and sue for her hand.    \"Then, Jane, you at least will not blame me for refusing my cousin's  hand?\"    \"That I won't, miss. Do you know, Miss Florence\"--and here Jane  lowered her voice--\"I've a suspicion that Mr. Curtis is married  already?\"    \"What do you mean, Jane?\" asked Florence, startled.    \"There was a poor young woman called here last month and inquired for  Mr. Curtis. She was very sorrowful-like, and poorly dressed. He came  up when she was at the door, and he spoke harshlike, and told her to  walk away with him. What they said I couldn't hear, but I've a  suspicion that she was married to him, secretlike for I saw a wedding  ring upon her finger.\"    \"But, Jane, it would be base and infamous for him to ask for my hand  when he was already married.\"    \"I can't help it, miss. That's just what he wouldn't mind doin'. Oh,  he's a sly deceiver, Mr. Curtis. I'd like to see him foolin' around  me.\"    Jane nodded her head with emphasis, as if to intimate the kind of  reception Curtis Waring would get if he attempted to trifle with her  virgin affections.    \"I hope what you suspect is not true,\" said Florence, gravely. \"I do  not like or respect Curtis, but I don't like to think he would be so  base as that. If you ever see this young woman again, try to find out  where she lives. I would like to make her acquaintance, and be a  friend to her if she needs one.\"    \"Shure, Miss Florence, you will be needin' a friend yourself.\"    \"It is true, Jane. I forgot that I am no longer a young lady of  fortune, but a penniless girl, obliged to work for a living.\"    \"What would your uncle say if he knew that Mr. Curtis had a wife?\"    \"We don't know that he has one, and till we do, it would not be  honorable to intimate such a thing to Uncle John.\"    \"Shure, he wouldn't be particular. It's all his fault that you're  obliged to leave home, and go into the streets. Why couldn't he take  no for an answer, and marry somebody else, if he can find anybody to  have him?\"    \"I wish, indeed, that he had fixed his affections elsewhere,\"  responded Florence, with a sigh.    \"Shure, he's twice as old as you, Miss Florence, anyway.\"    \"I shouldn't mind that so much, if that was the only objection.\"    \"It'll be a great deal better marryin' a young man.\"    \"I don't care to marry any one, Jane. I don't think I shall ever  marry.\"    \"It's all very well to say that, Miss Florence. Lots of girls say so,  but they change their minds. I don't mean to live out always myself.\"    \"Is there any young man you are interested in, Jane?\"    \"Maybe there is, and maybe there isn't, Miss Florence. If I ever do  get married I'll invite you to the wedding.\"    \"And I'll promise to come if I can. But I hear the bell. I think my  friend Dodger has come.\"    \"Shall I ask him in, miss?\"    \"No. Tell him I will be ready to accompany him at once.\"    She went out into the hall, and when the door was opened the visitor  proved to be Dodger. He had improved his appearance so far as his  limited means would allow. His hands and face were thoroughly clean;  he had bought a new collar and necktie; his shoes were polished, and  despite his shabby suit, he looked quite respectable. Getting a full  view of him, Florence saw that his face was frank and handsome, his  eyes bright, and his teeth like pearls.    \"Shure, he's a great deal better lookin' than Mr. Curtis,\" whispered  Jane. \"Here, Mr. Dodger, take Miss Florence's valise, and mind you  take good care of her.\"    \"I will,\" answered Dodger, heartily. \"Come, Miss Florence, if you  don't mind walking over to Fourth Avenue, we'll take the horse cars.\"    So, under strange guidance, Florence Linden left her luxurious home,  knowing not what awaited her. What haven of refuge she might find she  knew not. She, like Dodger, was adrift in New York.          Chapter VIII.  A Friendly Compact.      Florence, as she stepped on the sidewalk, turned, and fixed a last sad  look on the house that had been her home for so many years. She had  never anticipated such a sundering of home ties, and even now she  found it difficult to realize that the moment had come when her life  was to be rent in twain, and the sunlight of prosperity was to be  darkened and obscured by a gloomy and uncertain future.    She had hastily packed a few indispensable articles in a valise which  she carried in her hand.    \"Let me take your bag, Miss Florence,\" said Dodger, reaching out his  hand.    \"I don't want to trouble you, Dodger.\"    \"It ain't no trouble, Miss Florence. I'm stronger than you, and it  looks better for me to carry it.\"    \"You are very kind, Dodger. What would I do without you?\"    \"There's plenty that would be glad of the chance of helping you,\" said  Dodger, with a glance of admiration at the fair face of his companion.    \"I don't know where to find them,\" said Florence, sadly. \"Even my  uncle has turned against me.\"    \"He's an old chump!\" ejaculated Dodger, in a tone of disgust.    \"Hush! I cannot hear a word against him. He has always been kind and  considerate till now. It is the evil influence of my Cousin Curtis  that has turned him against me. When he comes to himself I am sure he  will regret his cruelty.\"    \"He would take you back if you would marry your cousin.\"    \"Yes; but that I will never do!\" exclaimed Florence, with energy.    \"Bully for you!\" said Dodger. \"Excuse me,\" he said, apologetically. \"I  ain't used to talkin' to young ladies, and perhaps that ain't proper  for me to say.\"    \"I don't mind, Dodger; your heart is in the right place.\"    \"Thank you, Miss Florence. I'm glad you've got confidence in me. I'll  try to deserve it.\"    \"Where are we going?\" asked the young lady, whose only thought up to  this moment had been to get away from the presence of Curtis and his  persecutions.    They had now reached Fourth Avenue, and a surface car was close at  hand.    \"We're going to get aboard that car,\" said Dodger, signaling with his  free hand. \"I'll tell you more when we're inside.\"    Florence entered the car, and Dodger, following, took a seat at her  side.    They presented a noticeable contrast, for Florence was dressed as  beseemed her station, while Dodger, in spite of his manly, attractive  face, was roughly attired, and looked like a working boy.    When the conductor came along, he drew out a dime, and tendered it in  payment of the double fare. The money was in the conductor's hand  before Florence was fully aware.    \"You must not pay for me, Dodger,\" she said.    \"Why not?\" asked the boy. \"Ain't we friends?\"    \"Yes, but you have no money to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#6)"],[1," died  within a week.    And now Mrs. Leigh was left to God and her own soul, with this young  lion-cub in leash, to tame and train for this life and the life to  come. She had loved her husband fervently and holily. He had been often  peevish, often melancholy; for he was a disappointed man, with an estate  impoverished by his father's folly, and his own youthful ambition, which  had led him up to Court, and made him waste his heart and his purse in  following a vain shadow. He was one of those men, moreover, who possess  almost every gift except the gift of the power to use them; and though  a scholar, a courtier, and a soldier, he had found himself, when he was  past forty, without settled employment or aim in life, by reason of  a certain shyness, pride, or delicate honor (call it which you will),  which had always kept him from playing a winning game in that very world  after whose prizes he hankered to the last, and on which he revenged  himself by continual grumbling. At last, by his good luck, he met with  a fair young Miss Foljambe, of Derbyshire, then about Queen Elizabeth's  Court, who was as tired as he of the sins of the world, though she had  seen less of them; and the two contrived to please each other so well,  that though the queen grumbled a little, as usual, at the lady for  marrying, and at the gentleman for adoring any one but her royal self,  they got leave to vanish from the little Babylon at Whitehall, and  settle in peace at Burrough. In her he found a treasure, and he knew  what he had found.    Mrs. Leigh was, and had been from her youth, one of those noble old  English churchwomen, without superstition, and without severity, who  are among the fairest features of that heroic time. There was a certain  melancholy about her, nevertheless; for the recollections of her  childhood carried her back to times when it was an awful thing to be a  Protestant. She could remember among them, five-and-twenty years ago,  the burning of poor blind Joan Waste at Derby, and of Mistress Joyce  Lewis, too, like herself, a lady born; and sometimes even now, in her  nightly dreams, rang in her ears her mother's bitter cries to God,  either to spare her that fiery torment, or to give her strength to bear  it, as she whom she loved had borne it before her. For her mother, who  was of a good family in Yorkshire, had been one of Queen Catherine's  bedchamber women, and the bosom friend and disciple of Anne Askew. And  she had sat in Smithfield, with blood curdled by horror, to see the  hapless Court beauty, a month before the paragon of Henry's Court,  carried in a chair (so crippled was she by the rack) to her fiery doom  at the stake, beside her fellow-courtier, Mr. Lascelles, while the very  heavens seemed to the shuddering mob around to speak their wrath and  grief in solemn thunder peals, and heavy drops which hissed upon the  crackling pile.    Therefore a sadness hung upon her all her life, and deepened in the days  of Queen Mary, when, as a notorious Protestant and heretic, she had had  to hide for her life among the hills and caverns of the Peak, and was  only saved, by the love which her husband's tenants bore her, and by his  bold declaration that, good Catholic as he was, he would run through  the body any constable, justice, or priest, yea, bishop or cardinal, who  dared to serve the queen's warrant upon his wife.    So she escaped: but, as I said, a sadness hung upon her all her life;  and the skirt of that dark mantle fell upon the young girl who had been  the partner of her wanderings and hidings among the lonely hills; and  who, after she was married, gave herself utterly up to God.    And yet in giving herself to God, Mrs. Leigh gave herself to her  husband, her children, and the poor of Northam Town, and was none the  less welcome to the Grenvilles, and Fortescues, and Chichesters, and  all the gentle families round, who honored her husband's talents, and  enjoyed his wit. She accustomed herself to austerities, which often  called forth the kindly rebukes of her husband; and yet she did so  without one superstitious thought of appeasing the fancied wrath of God,  or of giving Him pleasure (base thought) by any pain of hers; for her  spirit had been trained in the freest and loftiest doctrines of Luther's  school; and that little mystic \"Alt-Deutsch Theologie\" (to which the  great Reformer said that he owed more than to any book, save the Bible,  and St. Augustine) was her counsellor and comforter by day and night.    And now, at little past forty, she was left a widow: lovely still  in face and figure; and still more lovely from the divine calm which  brooded, like the dove of peace and the Holy Spirit of God (which indeed  it was), over every look, and word, and gesture; a sweetness which had  been ripened by storm, as well as by sunshine; which this world had  not given, and could not take away. No wonder that Sir Richard and Lady  Grenville loved her; no wonder that her children worshipped her; no  wonder that the young Amyas, when the first burst of grief was over, and  he knew again where he stood, felt that a new life had begun for him;  that his mother was no more to think and act for him only, but that he  must think and act for his mother. And so it was, that on the very day  after his father's funeral, when school-hours were over, instead of  coming straight home, he walked boldly into Sir Richard Grenville's  house, and asked to see his godfather.    \"You must be my father now, sir,\" said he, firmly.    And Sir Richard looked at the boy's broad strong face, and swore a great  and holy oath, like Glasgerion's, \"by oak, and ash, and thorn,\" that  he would be a father to him, and a brother to his mother, for Christ's  sake. And Lady Grenville took the boy by the hand, and walked home  with him to Burrough; and there the two fair women fell on each other's  necks, and wept together; the one for the loss which had been, the  other, as by a prophetic instinct, for the like loss which was to come  to her also. For the sweet St. Leger knew well that her husband's fiery  spirit would never leave his body on a peaceful bed; but that death (as  he prayed almost nightly that it might) would find him sword in  hand, upon the field of duty and of fame. And there those two vowed  everlasting sisterhood, and kept their vow; and after that all things  went on at Burrough as before; and Amyas rode, and shot, and boxed, and  wandered on the quay at Sir Richard's side; for Mrs. Leigh was too  wise a woman to alter one tittle of the training which her husband had  thought best for his younger boy. It was enough that her elder son had  of his own accord taken to that form of life in which she in her secret  heart would fain have moulded both her children. For Frank, God's  wedding gift to that pure love of hers, had won himself honor at home  and abroad; first at the school at Bideford; then at Exeter College,  where he had become a friend of Sir Philip Sidney's, and many another  young man of rank and promise; and next, in the summer of 1572, on his  way to the University of Heidelberg, he had gone to Paris, with (luckily  for him) letters of recommendation to Walsingham, at the English  Embassy: by which letters he not only fell in a second time with Philip  Sidney, but saved his own life (as Sidney did his) in the Massacre of  St. Bartholomew's Day. At Heidelberg he had stayed two years, winning  fresh honor from all who knew him, and resisting all Sidney's entreaties  to follow him into Italy. For, scorning to be a burden to his parents,  he had become at Heidelberg tutor to two young German princes, whom,  after living with them at their father's house for a year or more, he at  last, to his own great delight, took with him down to Padua, \"to  perfect them,\" as he wrote home, \"according to his insufficiency, in all  princely studies.\" Sidney was now returned to England; but Frank found  friends enough without him, such letters of recommendation and diplomas  did he carry from I know not how many princes, magnificos, and learned  doctors, who had fallen in love with the learning, modesty, and virtue  of the fair young Englishman. And ere Frank returned to Germany he had  satiated his soul with all the wonders of that wondrous land. He had  talked over the art of sonneteering with Tasso, the art of history  with Sarpi; he had listened, between awe and incredulity, to the daring  theories of Galileo; he had taken his pupils to Venice, that their  portraits might be painted by Paul Veronese; he had seen the palaces of  Palladio, and the merchant princes on the Rialto, and the argosies of  Ragusa, and all the wonders of that meeting-point of east and west; he  had watched Tintoretto's mighty hand \"hurling tempestuous glories o'er  the scene;\" and even, by dint of private intercession in high places,  had been admitted to that sacred room where, with long silver beard and  undimmed eye, amid a pantheon of his own creations, the ancient Titian,  patriarch of art, still lingered upon earth, and told old tales of the  Bellinis, and Raffaelle, and Michael Angelo, and the building of St.  Peter's, and the fire at Venice, and the sack of Rome, and of kings and  warriors, statesmen and poets, long since gone to their account, and  showed the sacred brush which Francis the First had stooped to pick up  for him. And (license forbidden to Sidney by his friend Languet) he had  been to Rome, and seen (much to the scandal of good Protestants at home)  that \"right good fellow,\" as Sidney calls him, who had not yet eaten  himself to death, the Pope for the time being. And he had seen the  frescos of the Vatican, and heard Palestrina preside as chapel-master  over the performance of his own music beneath the dome of St. Peter's,  and fallen half in love with those luscious strains, till he was  awakened from his dream by the recollection that beneath that same dome  had gone up thanksgivings to the God of heaven"]]]
