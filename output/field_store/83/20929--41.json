But those who are  ignorant would admire her in this dress, and there are many villages in  which she would be taken for the queen; hence we call sonnets made after  this model \"Village Queens.\"      34    No one passes in the world as skilled in verse unless he has put up the  sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But educated people do not want a  sign, and draw little distinction between the trade of a poet and that  of an embroiderer.    People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but  they are all these, and judges of all these. No one guesses what they  are. When they come into society, they talk on matters about which the  rest are talking. We do not observe in them one quality rather than  another, save when they have to make use of it. But then we remember it,  for it is characteristic of such persons that we do not say of them that  they are fine speakers, when it is not a question of oratory, and that  we say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is such a question.    It is therefore false praise to give a man when we say of him, on his  entry, that he is a very clever poet; and it is a bad sign when a man is  not asked to give his judgment on some verses.      35    We should not be able to say of a man, \"He is a mathematician,\" or \"a  preacher,\" or \"eloquent\"; but that he is \"a gentleman.\" That universal  quality alone pleases me. It is a bad sign when, on seeing a person, you  remember his book. I would prefer you to see no quality till you meet it  and have occasion to use it (_Ne quid nimis_[14]), for fear some one  quality prevail and designate the man. Let none think him a fine  speaker, unless oratory be in question, and then let them think it.      36    Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy them all.  \"This one is a good mathematician,\" one will say. But I have nothing to  do with mathematics; he would take me for a proposition. \"That one is a  good soldier.\" He would take me for a besieged town. I need, then, an  upright man who can accommodate himself generally to all my wants.      37    [Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of  everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far  better to know something about everything than to know all about one  thing. This universality is the best. If we can have both, still better;  but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former. And the world  feels this and does so; for the world is often a good judge.]      38    A poet and not an honest man.      39    If lightning fell on low places, etc., poets, and those who can only  reason about things of that kind, would lack proofs.      40    If we wished to prove the examples which we take to prove other things,  we should have to take those other things to be examples; for, as we  always believe the difficulty is in what we wish to prove, we find the  examples clearer and a help to demonstration.    Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the  rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a  particular case, we must begin with the general rule. For we always find  the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear which we use  for the proof; for, when a thing is put forward to be proved, we first  fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on  the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it  easily.      41    _Epigrams of Martial._--Man loves malice, but not against one-eyed men  nor the unfortunate, but against the fortunate and proud. People are  mistaken in thinking otherwise.    For lust is the source of all our actions, and humanity, etc. We must  please those who have humane and tender feelings. That epigram about two  one-eyed people is worthless,[15] for it does not console them, and only  gives a point to the author's glory. All that is only for the sake of  the author is worthless. _Ambitiosa recident ornamenta_.[16]      42    To call a king \"Prince\" is pleasing, because it diminishes his rank.      43    Certain authors, speaking of their works, say, \"My book,\" \"My  commentary,\" \"My history,\" etc. They resemble middle-class people who  have a house of their own, and always have \"My house\" on their tongue.  They would do better to say, \"Our book,\" \"Our commentary,\" \"Our  history,\" etc., because there is in them usually more of other people's  than their own.      44    Do you wish people to believe good of you? Don't speak.      45    Languages are ciphers, wherein letters are not changed into letters, but  words into words, so that an unknown language is decipherable.      46    A maker of witticisms, a bad character.      47    There are some who speak well and write badly. For the place and the  audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than they think of  without that warmth.      48    When we find words repeated in a discourse, and, in trying to correct  them, discover that they are so appropriate that we would spoil the  discourse, we must leave them alone. This is the test; and our attempt  is the work of envy, which is blind, and does not see that repetition is  not in this place a fault; for there is no general rule.      49    To mask nature and disguise her. No more king, pope, bishop--but _august  monarch_, etc.; not Paris--_the capital of the kingdom_. There are  places in which we ought to call Paris, Paris, and others in which we  ought to call it the capital of the kingdom.      50    The same meaning changes with the words which express it. Meanings  receive their dignity from words instead of giving it to them. Examples  should be sought....      51    Sceptic, for obstinate.      52    No one calls another a Cartesian[17] but he who is one himself, a pedant  but a pedant, a provincial but a provincial; and I would wager it was  the printer who put it on the title of _Letters to a Provincial_.      53    A carriage _upset_ or _overturned_, according to the meaning _To spread  abroad_ or _upset_, according to the meaning.

Proved by nature itself.    _Second part_: That there is a Redeemer. Proved by Scripture.      61    _Order._--I might well have taken this discourse in an order like this:  to show the vanity of all conditions of men, to show the vanity of  ordinary lives, and then the vanity of philosophic lives, sceptics,  stoics; but the order would not have been kept. I know a little what it  is, and how few people understand it. No human science can keep it.  Saint Thomas[20] did not keep it. Mathematics keep it, but they are  useless on account of their depth.      62    _Preface to the first part._--To speak of those who have treated of the  knowledge of self; of the divisions of Charron,[21] which sadden and  weary us; of the confusion of Montaigne;[22] that he was quite aware of  his want of method, and shunned it by jumping from subject to subject;  that he sought to be fashionable.    His foolish project of describing himself! And this not casually and  against his maxims, since every one makes mistakes, but by his maxims  themselves, and by first and chief design. For to say silly things by  chance and weakness is a common misfortune; but to say them  intentionally is intolerable, and to say such as that ...      63    _Montaigne._--Montaigne's faults are great. Lewd words; this is bad,  notwithstanding Mademoiselle de Gournay.[23] Credulous; _people without  eyes_.[24] Ignorant; _squaring the circle,[25] a greater world_.[26] His  opinions on suicide, on death.[27] He suggests an indifference about  salvation, _without fear and without repentance_.[28] As his book was  not written with a religious purpose, he was not bound to mention  religion; but it is always our duty not to turn men from it. One can  excuse his rather free and licentious opinions on some relations of life  (730,231)[29]; but one cannot excuse his thoroughly pagan views on  death, for a man must renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least  wish to die like a Christian. Now, through the whole of his book his  only conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one.      64    It is not in Montaigne, but in myself, that I find all that I see in  him.      65    What good there is in Montaigne can only have been acquired with  difficulty. The evil that is in him, I mean apart from his morality,  could have been corrected in a moment, if he had been informed that he  made too much of trifles and spoke too much of himself.      66    One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at  least serves as a rule of life, and there is nothing better.      67    _The vanity of the sciences._--Physical science will not console"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#6)"],[1,"almost constantly by young and old of both  sexes. The nut is divided into quarters and a piece of _buyo_ leaf[15]  is wrapped about each bit. To this is added a little lime and a pinch of  tobacco, and it is ready for the mouth. The resultant deep red saliva is  distributed indiscriminately on the floor, walls, and furniture where it  leaves a permanent stain. To hold the materials necessary for this  practice brass betel nut boxes, secured from the Moro or of their own  manufacture, as well as plaited grass boxes and pouches are constantly  carried (Plates XVIIa and XLI). The brass boxes generally have three  compartments; the first for nuts, the second for leaves and tobacco, and  the third for lime. Lime is also carried in small bamboo tubes (Fig.  14), in the decoration of which a great deal of time is consumed. The  open end is fitted with a rattan sifter so that the powder is  distributed evenly on the nut and leaf.    [14] _Catechu L_.    [15] _Piper betel L_.    FIG. 14. INCISED LIME AND TOBACCO TUBES.    Aged persons and those whose teeth have been so mutilated that they  cannot chew, make use of an outfit which includes a small mortar and  pestle (Plate XVIIb). Cutting open green betel nuts, the chewer wraps  the pieces in leaves and, after adding a liberal supply of lime, mashes  them in the mortar until all are reduced to a soft mass.    Lime is secured by placing snail shells in a fire, from which they are  taken while hot and dropped into cold water. They can then be crushed  into powder with the fingers.    Although the Bagobo raises a considerable quantity of tobacco he seldom,  if ever, smokes it unless the leaf is furnished him, already prepared,  by an outsider. Sometimes a small ball made of the green leaves is  placed between the teeth and upper lip, where it remains until all the  flavor has been extracted.    The outfits for betel nut and tobacco, aside from the brass boxes which  fasten at the side, are generally carried in the sacks worn on the backs  of the men or in the elaborate shoulder bags worn by the women. However,  a small waterproof box is frequently seen attached to a man's belt, and  in this he carries his betel nut, tobacco, and fire-making outfit.    The usual method of making fire is by the use of flint and steel, but  when this is not at hand a flame can be quickly obtained by rubbing two  pieces of bamboo rapidly together until the friction produces a spark.    HUNTING AND FISHING.    Since only a few domesticated animals and fowls are found in a  settlement, the greater part of the meat supply is secured by hunting  and fishing.    Deer and wild pig are taken by means of spears. The hunter either lies  in wait near the runways of the game, or the animals are driven toward  the spot where the huntsmen are concealed. For this purpose the ordinary  lance (Figs. 15a, b and c) is often used, but a more effective weapon is  the spear known as _kalawat_ (Fig. 15d). In this the metal head fits  loosely into a long shaft to which it is attached by a rope. As soon as  the weapon enters the body of the animal the head pulls out of the  shaft, and this trails behind until it becomes entangled in the  undergrowth, thus putting the game at the mercy of the hunter. Dead  falls and pits are put in the runways, and a frightened animal is  sometimes impaled on concealed sharpened bamboo sticks. Less frequently,  large animals are secured by means of rope loops which hang from trees  past which the game is accustomed to pass. Until recent years the  _balatik_, a trap which when sprung throws an arrow with great force  against the animal which releases it, was much used but so many domestic  animals have been killed by it that this sort of trap is now in  disfavor.    FIG. 15. SPEARS USED IN FIGHTING AND HUNTING.    Wild chickens are captured by means of snares (Fig. 16). A tame rooster  is fastened in the jungle and around him is placed a snare, consisting  of running knots attached to a central band. The crowing of this fowl  soon attracts the wild birds which, coming in to fight, are almost sure  to become entangled in one of the nooses. Slip loops, attached to a bent  twig and released by disturbing the bait, are also employed in the  capture of wild fowl.    FIG. 16. CHICKEN SNARE AND CARRYING CASE.    Birds of all sizes are secured by use of bows and arrows, blow guns, or  nets. Wooden decoys (Plate XVIII) are tied to the branches of trees in  which the hunters are concealed. The bows used are of _palma brava_, in  each end of which notches are cut to hold the rattan bow strings (Fig.  17). The arrow shafts are of light reeds and are fitted with one or two  bamboo points. These weapons are effective only for close range, and  even then the Bagobo are far from being expert marksmen. Boys use a reed  blow gun through which they shoot light darts tufted with cotton (Fig.  18). The missile is not poisoned and is of little use at a distance of  more than twenty feet.    FIG. 17. BOWS AND ARROWS.    FIG. 18. BLOW GUNS AND DARTS.    By far the most effective means of securing birds is to stretch a net  between trees or poles where the birds are accustomed to fly. Wooden  decoys are attached to the net in order to attract the game which, once  enmeshed, is easily caught.    Various devices are employed in the capture of fresh water fish,[16] but  the most common is a torpedo-shaped trap of bamboo (Fig. 19). Stone  conduits lead the water from streams into the open ends of these traps,  thus carrying in fish and shrimps. The funnel-shaped opening has the  sharpened ends set close together so that it is quite impossible for the  prisoners to escape, although the water readily passes between the  bamboo strips.    [16] Along the coast the methods of the Christianized natives are used  in salt water fishing.    FIG. 19. BAMBOO FISH TRAP.    A hook and line is employed, especially for eels; while in clear pools  fish are secured by means of a four-pointed spear which is thrust or  thrown (Fig. 20). Perhaps the most interesting device used is a lure,  known as _boro_ (Fig. 21). A live minnow is fastened at the end of the  rod near to a rattan noose. A cord running from the noose to the end of  the stick allows the fisherman to draw up the noose as he desires. The  struggles of the captive fish soon attract others, and when one enters  the loop the line is drawn taut, securely binding the intruder. Several  fish can be taken from a single pool by this method. A berry (_anamirta  coccithis L_.) is used in the capture of fish. It is crushed to a  powder, is wrapped with vines and leaves, and is thrown into pools. The  fish become stupified[sic] and float to the surface where they are  easily captured. After being cooked they are eaten without any ill  effects.    FIG. 20. (LEFT) FOUR-POINTED FISH SPEAR.    FIG. 21. (RIGHT) FISH LURE.    OCCUPATIONS.    Mention has already been made of some of the daily occupations of the  people. We have found the women caring for the home and preparing the  rice and other foods which are served in the house. At no time did the  writer see a man, other than a slave, take any part in such household  duties; but when on the trail each would do his share in preparing the  meals. In the village we found the women and children carrying the water  and wood and, at rare intervals, doing laundry work. Instead of soaping  and rubbing soiled clothing, they soak the garments in water, then place  them on stones and beat them with wooden paddles or clubs. The articles  are alternately soaked and beaten until at least a part of the dirt has  been removed. It is also the privilege of any woman to engage in the  manufacture of basketry, or to act as a potter.    In the manufacture of baskets the woman makes use chiefly of bamboo and  rattan, though other materials, such as _pandanus_ are sometimes brought  into service. Three weaves or their variants are employed. The first is  the common diagonal or twilled weave, in which each element of the weft  passes over two or more of the warp elements. In this way most of the  rice winnowers, transportation baskets, knife sheaths, and the like are  made. In the second weave (Fig. 22), the foundation of the basket is  made up of parallel horizontal rods, or strips of bamboo. These are  laced together by warp strips which pass alternately under one and over  one of the foundation rods, crossing each other at an angle, one above  the other below the rod. The trinket baskets carried by the women, the  larger waterproof receptacles known as _binota_, and the covers for wild  chicken snares are in this technic. A variant of this weave is found in  the rattan carrying frames and in some fish traps (Fig. 23). Here the  warp strips cross one another at an angle, at each meeting place  enclosing the horizontal foundation strips. Unlike the second weave  described, the warp strips do not pass alternately above and below the  horizontal foundation, but retain the same relation to it throughout the  entire length of each strip. A coiled weave (Fig. 24) is used in the  manufacture of tobacco boxes (Plate XIX) and in the rims of women's  baskets. In this type the foundation consists of a series of horizontal  rattan strips or rods which are sewed together in the following manner.  A narrow strip _A_ passes over two of these parallel rods _2_ and _3_ in  a left handed spiral. At the top of the loop the strip passes under a  similar strip _B_ which binds rod _2_ to the one above. Passing downward  inside the basket, the strip _A_ goes beneath the strip _C_ which binds  rods _3_ and _4_ together. These are drawn tightly while damp, thus  forcing the foundation rods so closely together as to make the basket  practically water-tight. Pitch from the _tabon-tabon_ nuts may also be  rubbed over the outside surface, thus making the receptacle impervious  to water.    FIG. 22.    FIG. 23.    FIG. 24.
