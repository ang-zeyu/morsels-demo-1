[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16220"],[0,"Rambles in the Mammoth Cave, during the Year 1844 (#6)"],[1,"is a cave, which we penetrated, as far as the Cooling Tub--a  beautiful basin of water six feet wide and three deep--into which a  small stream of the purest water pours itself from the ceiling and  afterwards finds its way into the Flint Pit at no great distance.  Returning, we wound around Gatewood's Dining Table, which nearly  blocks up the way, and continued our walk along the lower branch more  than half a mile, passing Napoleon's Dome, the Cinder Banks, the  Crystal Pool, the Salts Cave, etc., etc. Descending a few feet and  leaving the cave which continues onwards, we entered, on our right, a  place of great seclusion and grandeur, called Annetti's Dome. Through  a crevice in the right wall of the dome is a waterfall. The water  issues in a stream a foot in diameter, from a high cave in the side of  the dome--falls upon the solid bottom, and passes off by a small  channel into the Cistern, which is directly on the pathway of the  cave. The Cistern is a large pit, which is usually kept nearly full of  water.    Near the end of this branch, (the lower branch) there is a crevice in  the ceiling over the last spring, through which the sound of water may  be heard falling in a cave or open space above.    Highly gratified with what we had now seen in the Gothic Avenue, we  concluded to pursue it no further, but to retrace our steps to the  Main Cave, regretting however, that we had not visited the Salts Cave,  (a branch of the Gothic Avenue,) on being told, when too late, that it  would have amply compensated us for our trouble, being rich in fine  specimens of Epsom or Glauber salts.          CHAPTER IV.    The Ball-Room--Willie's Spring--Wandering Willie--Ox-Stalls--Giant's  Coffin--Acute-Angle or Great Bend--Range of Cabins--Curative Properties  of the Cave Air long known.      We are now again in the Main Cave or Grand Gallery, which continues to  increase in interest as we advance, eliciting from our party frequent  and loud exclamations of admiration and wonder. Not many steps from  the stairs leading down from the Gothic Avenue into the Main Cave, is  the Ball-Room, so called from its singular adaptedness to such a  purpose; for there is an orchestra, fifteen or eighteen feet high,  large enough to accommodate a hundred or more musicians, with a  gallery extending back to the level of the high embankment near the  Gothic Avenue; besides which, the avenue here is lofty, wide, straight  and perfectly level for several hundred feet. At the trifling expense  of a plank floor, seats and lamps, a ball-room might be had, if not  more splendid, at all events more grand and magnificent than any other  on earth. The effect of music here would be truly inspiring; but the  awful solemnity of the place may, in the opinion of many, prevent its  being used as a temple of Terpsichore. Extremes, we are told, often  meet. The same objection has been urged against the Cave's being used  for religious services. \"No clergyman,\" remarked a distinguished  divine, \"be he ever so eloquent could concentrate the attention of his  congregation in such a place. The God of nature speaks too loud here  for _man to be heard_.\"    Leaving these points to be settled as they may, we will proceed  onwards; the road now is broad and fine, and in many places dusty.  Next in order is Willie's Spring, a beautifully fluted niche in the  left hand wall, caused by the continual attrition of water trickling  down into a basin below. This spring derives its name from that of a  young gentleman, the son of a highly respectable clergyman of  Cincinnati, who, in the spirit of romance, assumed the name of  Wandering Willie, and taking with him his violin, marched on foot to  the Cave. Wishing no better place in which to pass the night, he  selected this spot, requesting the guide to call for him in the  morning. This he did and found him fast asleep upon his bed of earth,  with his violin beside him--ever since it has been called Willie's  Spring. Just beyond the spring and near the left wall, is the place  where the oxen were fed during the time of the miners; and strewn  around are a great many corn-cobs, to all appearance, and in fact,  perfectly sound, although they have lain there for more than thirty  years. In this neighborhood is a niche of great size in the wall on  the left, and reaching from the roof to the bottom of a pit more than  thirty feet deep, down the sides of which, water of the purest kind is  continually dripping, and is afterwards conducted to a large trough,  from which the invalids obtain their supply of water, during their  sojourn in the Cave. Near the bottom, this pit or well expands into a  large room, out of which, there is no opening. It is probable that  Richardson's Spring in the Deserted Chambers is supplied from this  well. Passing the Well Cave, Rocky Cave, etc., etc., we arrived at the  Giant's Coffin, a huge rock on the right, thus named from its singular  resemblance in shape to a coffin; its locality, apart from its great  size, renders it particularly conspicuous, as all must pass around it,  in leaving the Main Cave, to visit the rivers and the thousand wonders  beyond. At this point commence those incrustations, which, portraying  every imaginable figure on the ceiling, afford full scope to the  fanciful to picture what they will, whether of \"birds, or beasts, or  creeping things.\" About a hundred yards beyond the Coffin, the Cave  makes a majestic curve, and sweeping round the Great Bend or  Acute-Angle, resumes its general course. Here the guide ignited a  Bengal light. This vast amphitheatre became illuminated, and a scene  of enchantment was exposed to our view. Poets may conceive, but no  language can describe, the splendor and sublimity of the scene. The  rapturous exclamations of our party might have been heard from afar,  both up and down this place of wonders. Opposite to the Great Bend, is  the entrance of the Sick Room Cave, so called from the fact of the  sudden sickness of a visiter a few years ago, supposed to have been  caused by his smoking, with others, cigars in one of its most remote  and confined nooks. Immediately beyond the Great Bend, a row of  cabins, built for consumptive patients, commences. All of these are  framed buildings, with the exception of two, which are of stone. They  stand in line, from thirty to one hundred feet apart, exhibiting a  picturesque, yet at the same time, a gloomy and mournful appearance.  They are well furnished, and without question, would with good and  comfortable accommodations, pure air and uniform temperature, cure the  pulmonary consumption. The invalids in the Cave ought to be cured; but  I doubt whether the Cave air or any thing else can cure confirmed  Phthisis. A knowledge of the curative properties of the Cave air, is  not, as is generally supposed, of recent date. It has been long known.  A physician of great respectability, formerly a member of Congress  from the district adjoining the Cave, was so firmly convinced of the  medical properties of its air, as to express more than twenty years  ago, as his opinion, that the State of Kentucky ought to purchase it,  with a view to establish a hospital in one of its avenues. Again the  author of \"Calavar,\" himself a distinguished professor of medicine,  makes the following remarks in relation to the Cave air, as far back  as 1832, the date of his visit:    \"It is always temperate. Its purity, judging from its effects on the  lungs, and from other circumstances, is remarkable, though in what its  purity consists, I know not. But, be its composition what it may, it  is certain its effects upon the spirits and bodily powers of visiters,  are extremely exhilarating; and that it is not less salubrious than  enlivening. The nitre diggers were a famously healthy set of men; it  was a common and humane practice to employ laborers of enfeebled  constitutions, who were soon restored to health and strength, though  kept at constant labour; and more joyous, merry fellows were never  seen. The oxen, of which several were kept day and night in the Cave,  hauling the nitrous earth, were after a month or two of toil, in as  fine condition for the shambles, as if fattened in the stall. The  ordinary visiter, though rambling a dozen hours or more, over paths of  the roughest and most difficult kind, is seldom conscious of fatigue,  until he returns to the upper air; and then it seems to him, at least  in the summer season, that he has exchanged the atmosphere of paradise  for that of a charnel warmed by steam--all without is so heavy, so  dank, so dead, so mephitic. Awe and even apprehension, if that has  been felt, soon yield to the influence of the delicious air of the  Cave; and after a time a certain jocund feeling is found mingled with  the deepest impressions of sublimity, which there are so many objects  to awaken. I recommend all broken hearted lovers and dyspeptic dandies  to carry their complaints to the Mammoth Cave, where they will  undoubtedly find themselves \"translated\" into very buxom and happy  persons before they are aware of it.\"    [Illustration: STAR CHAMBER.

The Star Chamber next attracted our attention. It presents the most  perfect optical illusion imaginable; in looking up to the ceiling,  which is here very high, you seem to see the very firmament itself,  studded with stars; and afar off, a comet with its long, bright tail.  Not far from this Star Chamber, may be seen, in a cavity in the wall  on the right, and about twenty feet above the floor, an oak pole about  ten feet long and six inches in diameter, with two round sticks of  half the thickness and three feet long, tied on to it transversely, at  about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#6)"],[1," about 70 tons burden, considered to be      the fastest sailing packet from Dieppe, survived our voyage only about      eighteen months.

The crew was with      difficulty saved--and the vessel went down within about twenty-five      minutes after the shock.

The town of Dieppe contains a population of about twenty-thousand  souls.[22] Of these, by much the greater _stationary_ part are females;  arising from one third at least of the males being constantly engaged in  the FISHERIES. As these fisheries are the main support of the inhabitants,  it is right that you should know something about them. The _herring_  fishery takes place twice a year: in August and October. The August fishery  is carried on along the shores of England and the North. From sixty to  eighty vessels, of from twenty-five to thirty tons burthen each, with about  fifteen men in each vessel, are usually employed. They are freighted with  salt and empty barrels, for seasoning and stowing the fish, and they return  about the end of October. The herrings caught in August are considerably  preferable to those caught in October. The October fishery is carried on  with smaller vessels, along the coast of France from Boulogne to Havre.  From one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and thirty vessels, are engaged  in this latter navigation; and the fish, which is smaller, and of inferior  flavour to that caught upon the English coasts, is sent almost entirely to  the provinces and to Paris, where it is eaten fresh. So much for the  herring.[23]    The _Mackarel_ fishery usually commences towards the month of July, along  the coast of Picardy; because, being a sort of fish of passage, it gets  into the channel in the month of April. It then moves towards the straits  of Dover, as summer approaches. For this fishery they make use of large  decked-vessels, from twenty to fifty tons burthen, manned with from twelve  to twenty men. There are however Dieppe boats employed in this fishery  which go as far as the Scilly Islands and Ushant, towards the middle of  April. They carry with them the salt requisite to season the fish, which  are afterwards sent to Paris, and to the provinces in the interior of  France. The _cod fishery_ is divided into the fresh and dried fish. The  former continues from the beginning of February to the end of April--and  the vessels employed, which go as far as Newfoundland, are two deckers, and  from one hundred to one hundred and fifty tons burthen--although, in fact,  they rarely carry more than fifteen tons for fear of spoiling the fish. The  dried-cod fishery is carried on in vessels of all sizes; but it is  essential that they be of a certain depth, because the fish is more  cumbersome than weighty. The vessels however usually set sail about the  month of March or April, in order that they may have the advantage of the  summer season, to dry the fish. There are vessels which go to Newfoundland  laden with brandy, flour, beans, treacle, linen and woollen cloths, which  they dispose of to the inhabitants of the French colonies in exchange for  dried cod. This latter species of commerce may be carried on in the summer  months--as late as July.    In the common markets for retail trade, they are not very nice in the  quality or condition of their fish; and enormous conger eels, which would  be instantly rejected by the middling, or even lower classes in England,  are, at Dieppe, bought with avidity and relished with glee. A few francs  will procure a dish of fish large enough for a dozen people. The quays are  constantly crowded, but there seems to be more of bustle than of business.  The town is certainly picturesque, notwithstanding the houses are very  little more than a century old, and the streets are formal and  comparatively wide. Indeed it should seem that the houses were built  expressly for Noblemen and Gentlemen, although they are inhabited by  tradesmen, mechanics, and artizans, in apparently very indifferent  circumstances. I scarcely saw six private houses which could be called  elegant, and not a gentleman's carriage has been yet noticed in the  streets. But if the _Dieppois_ are not rich, they seem happy, and are in a  constant state of occupation. A woman sells her wares in an open shop, or  in an insulated booth, and sits without her bonnet (as indeed do all the  tradesmen's wives), and works or sings as humour sways her. A man sells  gingerbread in an open shed, and in the intervals of his customer's coming,  reads some popular history or romance. Most of the upper windows are wholly  destitute of glass; but are smothered with clothes, rags, and wall flowers.  The fragrance emitted from these flowers affords no unpleasing antidote to  odors of a very different description; and here we begin to have a too  convincing proof of the general character of the country in regard to the  want of cleanliness. A little good sense, or rather a better-regulated  police, would speedily get rid of such nuisances. The want of public sewers  is another great and grievous cause of smells of every description. At  Dieppe there are fountains in abundance; and if some of the limpid streams,  which issue from them, were directed to cleansing the streets, (which are  excellently well paved) the effect would be both more salubrious and  pleasant--especially to the sensitive organs of Englishmen.    We had hardly concluded our breakfasts, when a loud and clattering sound  was heard; and down came, in a heavy trot, with sundry ear-piercing  crackings of the whip, the thundering _Diligence_: large, lofty, and of  most unwieldy dimensions: of a structure, too, strong enough to carry a  half score of elephants. The postilion is an animal perfectly _sui  generis_: gay, alert, and living upon the best possible terms with himself.  He wears the royal livery, red and blue; with a plate of the fleur de lis  upon his left arm. His hair is tied behind, in a thick, short, tightly  fastened queue: with powder and pomatum enough to weather a whole winter's  storm and tempest.[24] As he never rises in his stirrups,[25] I leave you  to judge of the merciless effects of this ever-beating club upon the  texture of his jacket. He is however fond of his horses: is well known by  them; and there is all flourish and noise, and no sort of cruelty, in his  treatment of them. His spurs are of tremendous dimensions; such as we see  sticking to the heels of knights in illuminated Mss. of the XVth century.  He has nothing to do with the ponderous machine behind him. He sits upon  the near of the two wheel horses, with three horses before him. His  turnings are all adroitly and correctly made; and, upon the whole, he is a  clever fellow in the exercise of his office.    You ought to know, that, formerly, this town was greatly celebrated for its  manufactures in _Ivory_; but the present aspect of the ivory-market affords  only a faint notion of what it might have been in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries. I purchased a few subordinate articles (chiefly of a  religious character) and which I shall preserve rather as a matter of  evidence than of admiration. There is yet however a considerable  manufacture of _thread lace_; and between three and four thousand females  are supposed to earn a comfortable livelihood by it.[26]    My love of ecclesiastical architecture quickly induced me to visit the  CHURCHES; and I set out with two English gentlemen to pay our respects to  the principal church, St. JAQUES. As we entered it, a general gloom  prevailed, and a sort of premature evening came on; while the clatter of  the sabots was sufficiently audible along the aisles. In making the circuit  of the side chapels, an unusual light proceeded from a sort of grated door  way. We approached, and witnessed a sight which could not fail to rivet our  attention. In what seemed to be an excavated interior, were several  figures, cut in stone, and coloured after life, (of which they were the  size) representing the _Three Maries, St. John, and Joseph of Arimathea_..  in the act of entombing Christ: the figure of our Saviour being half sunk  into the tomb. The whole was partially illuminated by some two dozen of  shabby and nearly consumed tallow candles; affording a striking contrast to  the increasing darkness of the nave and the side aisles. We retired, more  and more struck with the novelty of every object around us, to our supper  and beds, which were excellent; and a good night's rest made me forget the  miseries of the preceding evening.    The next morning, being Sunday, we betook ourselves in good time to the  service of ST. JAQUES:[27] but on our way thither, we saw a waxen figure of  Christ (usually called an \"Ecce Homo\") enclosed within a box, of which the  doors were opened. The figure and box are the property of the man who plays  on a violin, close to the box; and who is selling little mass"]]]
