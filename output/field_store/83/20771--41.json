Certain foods which in the raw state  contain very little water, such as the pulses and cereals when cooked  absorb a very large quantity; this is particularly the case in making  porridge. Cabbage, cauliflower, Spanish onions and turnips, after cooking  contain even 97 per cent. of water. Roast beef contains on an average 48  per cent., and cooked round steak with fat removed 63 per cent. of water.  It is customary at meal times to drink water, tea, coffee, beer, wine, &c.  When a meal contains any considerable quantity of fresh fruits there need  be no desire to drink. Notwithstanding that fruits contain so much water,  a dietary consisting of fruits with nuts, to which may be added bread and  vegetables, will contain less water than the total quantity usually  consumed by a person taking the more customary highly cooked and seasoned  foods. An advantage is that the water in fruits is in a wholesome  condition, free from the pollution often met with in the water used for  drinking purposes. Raw fruits favour mastication, with its consequent  advantages, whilst cooked and soft food discourages it. Plums and what are  termed stone fruits, if eaten in more than very small quantities, are apt  to disagree. Persons with good digestions can take fruit with bread,  biscuits and with uncooked foods without any inconvenience. Fruit is more  likely to disagree when taken in conjunction with elaborately cooked  foods. Many cannot take fruit, especially if it be acid, at the same time  as cereal or starchy substances, and the difficulty is said to be greater  at the morning's meal. If the indigestion produced is due to the acid of  the fruit preventing the saliva acting on the starch, scientific  principles would direct that the fruit be eaten quite towards the end of  the meal. The same consideration condemns the use of mint sauce, cucumber  and vinegar, or pickles, with potatoes and bread, or even mint sauce with  green peas. Bananas are an exception, as not interfering with the  digestion of starch. Bananas are generally eaten in an unripe condition,  white and somewhat mealy; they should be kept until the starch has been  converted into sugar, when they are both more pleasant and wholesome. Nuts  and fruit go well together. For a portable meal, stoned raisins or other  dried fruit and walnut kernels or other nuts are excellent.    What has been called a defect in most fruits, is the fact that the proteid  is small in proportion to the other constituents. This has been too much  dwelt upon, owing to the prevailing exaggerated idea of the quantity of  proteid required. The tomato contains a large proportion, though the water  is very high. Bananas, grapes and strawberries contain to each part of  proteid from 10 to 12 parts of other solid nutritive constituents (any oil  being calculated into starch equivalents); this is termed the nutritive  ratio. Although this may seem a small proportion of proteid, there are  reasons for believing that it is sufficient. Taking the average of 29  analyses of American apples, a nutritive ratio of 33 was obtained. If it  were suggested that life should be sustained on apples alone, this small  quantity of proteid would be an insurmountable difficulty. As the addition  of nuts or other nutritious food sufficiently increases the proteid, no  objection can with justice be made against the use of fruit. A study of  our teeth, digestive organs and general structure, and of comparative  anatomy, points to fruits, nuts and succulent vegetables as our original  diet.    The potash and other salts of the organic acids in fruits tend to keep the  blood properly alkaline. Where there is a tendency to the deposition of  uric acid in the body, they hinder its formation. Citric, tartaric, malic  and other organic acids exist in fruits in combination with potash and  other bases, as well as in the free state. The free acids in fruits, when  eaten, combine with the alkalies in the intestinal tract, and are absorbed  by the body and pass into the blood, not as acids, but as neutral salts.  Here they are converted into potassium carbonate or some other carbonate.  Fruit acids never make the blood acid but the reverse. Fruit salts and  acids are antiscorbutic. Fruits have often proved of the greatest benefit  in illness. What is known as the grape cure has been productive of much  good. Lemons and oranges have also been of great benefit. Strawberries  have been craved for and have proved of the greatest advantage in some  extreme cases of illness when more concentrated food could not be endured.  Fruit is coming into greater use, especially owing to its better  distribution and lessened cost. Fruit is not as cheap as it should be, as  it can be produced in great abundance at little cost, and with  comparatively little labour. The price paid by the public greatly exceeds  the real cost of production. A very large proportion, often the greater  part of the cost to the consumer, goes in railway and other rates and in  middle-men's profits. It is commonly cheaper to bring fruit from over the  sea, including land carriage on either side, than it is to transport  English produce from one part of our country to another. English homegrown  fruit would be cheaper were it not for the difficulty of buying suitable  land at a reasonable price, and the cost of transit. For the production of  prime fruit there is a lack of sufficient intelligence, of scientific  culture and co-operation.    Vegetables--using the name in its popular sense--contain valuable saline  constituents or salts. By the usual method of cooking a large proportion  of the salts is lost. It is better to steam than to boil them. The fibrous  portion of vegetables is not all digested, but it is useful in stimulating  the peristaltic action of the bowels and lessening any tendency to  constipation. Vegetables are more especially useful to non-vegetarians to  correct the defects of their other food.    The potato belongs to a poisonous order--the _Solanacae_. There is a little  alkaloid in the skin, but this is lost in the cooking. The eyes and  sprouting portions contain the most and should be cut out.    Fungi.--There are about a hundred edible species in this country, but  many of the fungi are poisonous, some intensely so. It can scarcely be  expected that these lowly organised plants, differing so much in their  manner of growth from the green or chlorophyll bearing plants, can be  particularly nourishing. It is only the fructifying part, which appears  above the ground, that is generally eaten. It is of very rapid growth. Of  9 edible fungi of 4 species, obtained in the Belgrade market, the average  amount of water was 89.3 per cent., leaving only 10.7 per cent. of solid  matter; the average of fat was 0.55 per cent. The food value of fungi has  been greatly over-rated. In most of the analyses given in text-books and  elsewhere, the total nitrogen has been multiplied by 6.25 and the result  expressed as proteid. The amount of nitrogen in a form useless for the  purpose of nutrition is about a third of the whole. Of the remainder or  proteid nitrogen, it is said much is not assimilated, sometimes quite  half, owing to the somewhat indigestible character of the fungi. An  analysis of the common mushroom gave proteids 2.2 per cent., amides  (useless nitrogenous compounds) 1.3 per cent., and water 93.7 per cent.  The fungi are of inferior nutritive value to many fresh vegetables and are  much more expensive. Their chief value is as a flavouring.    Milk and Eggs are permissible in a vegetarian dietary, and as a rule,  vegetarians use them. Eggs, with the exception of such as are unfertile,  are of course alive; but they have no conscious existence, and cannot be  said to suffer any pain on being killed and eaten. An objection to their  use as food is, that on an egg and poultry farm, the superfluous male  birds are killed, and as the hens become unprofitable layers they are also  killed. A similar humane objection applies to the use of cow's milk by  man. The calves are deprived of part of their natural food, the deficiency  being perhaps made up by unnatural farinaceous milk substitutes. Many of  the calves, especially the bull calves, are killed, thus leaving all the  milk for human use. When cows cease to yield sufficient milk they too are  slaughtered. Milch cows are commonly kept in unhealthy houses, deprived  of exercise and pure air, crowded together, with filthy evil smelling  floors reeking with their excrements, tended by uncleanly people. With no  exercise and a rich stimulating diet they produce more milk; but it is no  matter for surprise that tuberculosis is common amongst them. When the  lesions of tubercle (consumption) are localised and not excessive, the  rest of the carcase is passed by veterinary surgeons as fit for food; were  it otherwise, enormous quantities of meat would be destroyed. As butcher's  meat is seldom officially inspected, but a very small part is judged by  the butchers as too bad for food. In mitigation it may be said that  poultry lead a happy existence and their death is, or should be, quickly  produced with but little pain, probably less pain than if left to die from  natural causes. The same cannot be said of cattle and sheep when the time  arrives for their transport to the slaughter man's. It is argued by  vegetarians who take milk and animal products that they are not  responsible for the death of the animals, as they do not eat their flesh.  As vegetarians profit by conditions in which the slaughtering of the  animals is a part, they cannot be altogether exonerated. Cow's milk is  prone to absorb bad odours, and it forms a most suitable breeding or  nutrient medium for most species of bacteria which may accidentally get  therein. By means of milk many epidemics have been spread, of scarlet  fever, diphtheria, cholera, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#6)"],[1,"to us with pretty little souvenir marks on the  butts. We next apply for a special licence to shoot big game, and this  is promised, but as it takes time to prepare will be sent up country  after us.    The import duly on alcohol is very heavy and runs up to 47 per cent. _ad  valorem_ and no still of any kind is permitted to be set up in the  country. Beyond Matadi indeed, special permission has to be obtained  before Europeans can carry any spirituous liquors, and then they have to  declare that it is not for sale to the natives. Heads of commercial  houses are made responsible for the observance of this law by their  employes and the State officials themselves are only permitted to have  three litres of spirits each month, while absinthe is entirely  prohibited. Every white man, however, is given one litre of red wine  each day as a ration and there seems to be no limit to the amount of  beer which may be drunk, except its great price, for a bottle of lager  costs 3 francs at Leopoldville and twice that amount higher up the  river.    It is indeed becoming apparent that the Government is a veritable parent  and a stern one also. However, as we promise to be good boys we are  permitted to carry a few cases of whisky and wine--after paying the  duty--to act as _medical comforts_. in case of sickness. These medical  comforts are also a feature of the State, each white being allowed a  bottle or two of champagne and port every three months. Every official  indeed receives much kindness and consideration from the State but is  severely punished any lapse of duty. The whites are fined for  carelessness or negligence, by stopping their pay for a certain number  of days, and for serious offences any official may be revocated, when he  will perhaps lose six months' or even a years' pay. Offences against the  penal laws are of course punished by imprisonment.    An excellent institution in Boma is the _colonie scolaire_ where  foundlings are reared and educated. Orphans, deserted children,  half-castes, all are received and trained for some useful purpose, some  entering the army, some engaging on the plantations, some becoming  servants to the officials.    It is impossible to form any idea of the Congo native in Boma, for the  blacks are of very different nationalities. Natives from Lagos,  Sierra-Leone, Portuguese and French territory, all are attracted by the  high wages to be earned in the town. Indeed at present most of the  positions of responsibility, requiring a fair education, are held by  foreign blacks, for very few true Congolese can be trusted. The personal  servants we engaged were thus all foreigners in the State service. Two  rejoiced in the names of Chikaia and Jean, and acted as _boys_. _i.e._ as  valets, butlers and general servants while Luembo was cook, and Mavunga,  washerman. Each one had a formal contract of five articles signed by us,  by a delegate for the Governor General, and by the Judge of Premiere  Instance, whose duty it was to see the contract was not broken. The  State indeed, superintends everything even to the finding and engaging  of private servants for travellers. The wages earned by these boys are  very much higher than servants receive in India or China. The cook was  paid 35 francs and the others 25 francs per month and all found.    The Customs, the Post Office, and the Land Office, are all conveniently  situated in one building on the beach near to the landing pier. In the  latter, all the landowners in the State are registered, careful maps  being prepared showing the extent and position of each plot of land. The  land laws are very simple. The villages are the absolute freehold  property of the natives, and are registered in the names of the Chiefs.  Vacant lands as usual are the property of the State and the Chartered  Companies, Missionaries, and Traders, as a rule, are annual leaseholders  but the lease is always renewed if the conditions on which it is granted  are observed.    On Sunday we lunched with the Governor General, Mr. Gohr, the Director  of Justice--who at present is in the unenviable position of having many  critics in Europe, usually imperfectly informed of the details and  evidence laid before the judges--Mr. Vandamme, who knows everyone and  everything connected with the State, Commandant and Madame Sillye, Judge  and Madame Webber, and some others. Afterwards, Mr. Webber, the Judge of  the Court of Premiere Instance, who is an excellent pianist, gives us  proof of his talent. This is the last pleasant music we are fated to  hear for many a month, for nothing but concertinas and gramophones are  found in the interior.    [Illustration: THE CATARACTS RAILWAY NEAR MATADI.]    Having obtained bundles of permits to do various things, and arranged  for letters and parcels to be sent after us into the interior, we left  Boma on the morning of July 19th for Matadi in the _Leopoldville_.. The  Congo just above Boma somewhat resembles the Highlands of Scotland, and  the similarity was emphasised by the fact that it was raining hard.  The hills were bare of trees, the current ran rapidly, forming  whirlpools, while many sleepy crocodiles lazily flopped into the water  as we passed. After ascending some twenty miles, the river turns sharply  to the right and runs between cliffs which descend sheer into the water,  forming a narrow chasm not more than half a mile broad. As the whole of  the immense volume of water in the Congo has to pass through this gorge,  it is enormously deep and the current is very rapid. The depth has not  been accurately ascertained, but it is certainly 500 feet, if not more,  and the flow of the water is at the rate of nearly ten knots an hour, so  that the smaller steamers cannot ascend at all, and the larger only  creep slowly up.    [Illustration: THE RAILWAY STATION AT MATADI.]    Matadi is soon after in sight. It is built on the south side of the  Congo valley, for, as a glance at the map will explain, the State owns  both banks at this point, but further up, the river becomes the frontier  with the French Congo. Matadi is an ancient--if the word may be used in  connection with the Congo at all--settlement, constructed at the point  where navigation on the river is interrupted by cataracts and rapids for  some two hundred miles until smooth water is reached again at Stanley  Pool. A caravan route runs from Matadi to Leopoldville, and it was  during the march of twenty days over the mountains that in the early  days, so much trouble was occasioned by the native porters. All this is  abolished now by the railway. The town itself stands on the side of a  steep hill and consists of narrow streets paved with cobbles. Here as  usual in the Congo, man is restricted to his primeval method of  locomotion. Two iron piers jut into the stream and at their ends the  European steamers discharge their cargoes into the railway trucks  alongside. High up on the hill stands a capacious stone structure, the  house of the Commissioner of the Matadi District, Mr. De Rache, with  whom we dine, after arranging to leave by the train which starts next  day. The distance to be traversed is 220 miles and the fare is L8 each  1st. class and L1 second for the boys. Besides this, baggage over a  hundred kilos, is charged at the rate of one franc a kilo, which is  probably the highest rate paid for railway travelling in the world. Our  fares indeed cost us about L80.    Early in the morning of the 20th, we leave Matadi. The train consists of  two engines, two open covered carriages for the second class passengers,  who are mostly natives, a saloon and baggage wagon. The gauge is a very  narrow one, so space is all-important, but the man who designed the  chairs in the saloon must have exercised the most fiendish ingenuity to  make them as uncomfortable as possible. There are six on each side,  arranged in pairs with a small bracket table in between, and each one is  on a pivot. The back is straight upright and the seat is of cane,  cone-shaped, the highest point being in the centre. Now as the curves  and gradients of the line are very sharp indeed, it is necessary to hold  fast the whole time, to prevent slipping on to the floor. If one puts a  foot on the opposite seat to steady oneself, it at once revolves,  leaving the leg in mid air. However, we fix ourselves in as well as  possible and enjoy the magnificent scenery. For a few hundred yards the  line runs along the valley of the Congo and a good view of the lowest  cataract is obtained, the brown water dashing over the rocks and  throwing up spray which is converted into brilliant jewels by the  youthful sun not yet an hour old. Then turning sharply to the right, the  train runs up the valley of the Posu, a mountain torrent which rushes  and roars through a narrow defile. Snorting angrily, the engines climb  up this steep gradient, cross the river by an iron bridge and then  groaning under the brakes, slide down into another valley. The main  direction however, is upwards, and as the country opens out below, one  gets a first impression of the enormity and grandeur of Central Africa.  As far as the eye reaches, are ranges of hills, the Palabala Mountains  crowned by a great cone which appears first on one side then the other,  as we cork-screw our way up. The line indeed is a marvel of engineering  construction, for a most difficult piece of country is traversed without  a single tunnel and with very few cuttings and embankments. The length  of the railway is, of course, very much greater than a straight line  would be between the same points, for it frequently countermarches  backwards and forwards up a hill side, and after a detour of perhaps a  quarter of a mile, comes back to the same place, but thirty or forty  feet higher up. The company which undertook the task of building the  line met with many difficulties, but finished it at a cost of L3,000,000  and many native lives. It was built between the"]]]
