The front will be occupied in its entire space  by a door, which will require to be hung on strong iron hinges, and  the framework of this door should be constructed of 1 inch by 1/4 inch  iron--a rather stouter material will really be no disadvantage--to  which the sheet-iron plates must be riveted. In the centre of the door  must be cut a slit, say 1-1/2 inches by 9 inches, which will require  to be covered with mica or talc behind which must be placed the  thermometer, so as it can be seen during the process of stoving,  without the necessity of opening the door, which, of course, more or  less cools the oven. And, by the way, this thermometer must register  higher than the highest temperature the oven is capable of reaching.  Above is shown a sketch of the stove, interior and exterior, which  will give an idea of what a japanner's stove is like.    [Illustration: FIG. 3--Showing Stove when Open, and Back of Door.]    Inside the stove it will be necessary to fix rows of iron rods, some  four inches from the top, from which to suspend the work, or  angle-iron ledges can be used on which the rods or bars can be fixed,  these arrangements being varied according to the particular  description of work, individual fancy, or other circumstances. Large S  hooks are about the handiest to use. A necessary adjunct of the stove  is a pan, which can be made by any handy man or tinworker, which  should be made to fit the bottom of the stove above the gas jets, it  being arranged that it rests on two side ledges, or along some rods.  One a couple of inches in depth will be found sufficient, and it will  repay its cost in the saving of enamel, it being possible with its use  to enamel a bicycle with as little as a gallon of enamel. Some workmen  have the tray made with a couple of hinged side flaps, to turn over  and cover up the pan when not in use, but this is a matter of fancy.  Of course, they must always be covered up when not in use. For those  who would prefer to use Bunsen burners, I show at Fig. 4 a sketch of  the best to employ, these having three rows of holes in each.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Bunsen Burner.]    When brick ovens are employed they must be lined with sheet-iron, and  in these very rare circumstances where gas is not available, the stove  can be heated with coal or wood, which will, of course, involve a  total alteration in the structural arrangements. I have not given the  details here, as I do not think the necessity will ever arise for  their use, and for the same reason I have refrained from giving the  particulars for heating by steam and electricity, or the other methods  which have been adopted by various workers, as there is no question  but that a gas stove or oven, as described, is about the best and  handiest for jobbers or amateurs.      MODERN JAPANNING AND ENAMELLING STOVES.    The modern japanning and enamelling stove consists of a compartment  capable of being heated to any desired temperature, say 100 deg. to 400 deg.  F., and at the same time, except as regards ventilation, capable of  being hermetically sealed so as to prevent access of dust, soot, and  dirt of all kinds to mar the beauty and lustre of the object being  enamelled or japanned. Such a stove may be heated--    1. By a direct coal, coke, wood, peat, or gas fire (which surrounds  the inner isolated chamber) (Fig. 5).    2. By heated air.    3. By steam or hot-water pipes, coils of which circulate round the  interior of the stove or under the floor.    Such ovens may be either permanent, that is, built into masonry, or  portable.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Greuzburg's Japanning Oven.]    1. _Stoves heated by direct fire._--These were, of course, the form in  which japanning ovens were constructed somewhat after the style of a  drying kiln. Fig. 5, Greuzburg's japanning oven heated on the outside  by hot gases from furnace. The oven is built into brickwork, and the  hot gases circulate in the flues between the brickwork and the oven,  and its erection and the arrangement of the heating flues are a  bricklayer's job. Coke containing much sulphur is objectionable as a  fuel for enamel stoves Mr. Dickson emphasizes this very forcibly. He  says: \"In the days when stoves were heated by coke furnaces, and the  heat distributed by the flues, the principal trouble was the escape of  fumes of sulphur which caused dire disaster to all the enamels by  entering into their composition and preventing their ever drying, not  to speak of hardening. I have known enamels to be in the stoves with  heat to 270 deg. for two and three days, and then be soft. The sulphur  also caused the enamels to crack in a peculiar manner, much like a  crocodile skin, and work so affected could never be made  satisfactory, for here again we come back to the first principle,  that if the foundation be not good, the superstructure can never be  permanent. The enamels, being permeated with sulphur and other  products from the coke, could never be made satisfactory, and the only  way was to clean it all off. The other principal troubles are the  blowing of the work in air bubbles, which is caused mainly by the heat  being too suddenly applied to the articles, but these are very small  matters to the experienced craftsman.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    2. _Stoves heated by hot-water pipes._--Let us first of all consider  the principle on which these are constructed. In Perkins' apparatus  for conveying heat through buildings by the circulation of water in  small-bore hot-water pipes an endless tube or pipe is employed, the  surface of which is occasionally increased by spiral or other turnings  where the heat is to be given off or acquired: the annexed figure may  serve to illustrate this principle; it represents a strong  wrought-iron tube of about one inch diameter completely filled with  water; the spiral A passes through a furnace where it is highly  heated, and the water is consequently put into motion in the direction  of the arrows; the boiling of the water or formation of steam is  prevented by the pressure, whence the necessity of the extreme  perfection and strength of the tube. B represents a second coil which  is supposed to be in an apartment where the heat is to be given out. C  is a screw stopper by which the water may be occasionally replenished.  By this form of apparatus the water may be heated to 300 deg. or 400 deg., or  even higher, so as occasionally to singe paper. A larger tube and  lower temperature are, however, generally preferable.[1]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Enamelling Stove--in a Tin-plate Printing  Factory--heated by Perkins' Hot-water Pipes.]    The principle of Perkins' invention has, during the last eighty  years, i.e. since the date of the invention in 1831, been very  extensively applied not only for the heating of buildings of every  description, but it has also been utilized for numerous industrial  purposes which require an atmosphere heated up to 600 deg. F. The  principle lends itself specially to the design of apparatus for  raising and maintaining heat evenly and uniformly, and also very  economically for such purposes as enamelling, japanning, and  lacquering.    The distinctive feature of this apparatus when applied to moderate  temperatures lies in the adoption of a closed system of piping of  small bore, a certain portion of which is wound into a coil and placed  in a furnace situated in any convenient position outside the drying  chamber or hot closet. The circulation is thus hermetically sealed and  so proportioned that while a much higher temperature can be attained  than is possible with a system of pipes open to the atmosphere, yet a  certain and perfectly safe maximum cannot by any possibility be  exceeded.    The efficiency of the apparatus increases within certain limits in  proportion to the pressure employed, which fact explains the  exceedingly economical results obtained, while the fact that, owing to  the high temperature used, a small-bore pipe can be made more  effective than the larger pipes used in any open system, accounts for  the lower first cost of the Perkins' apparatus.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Japanning and Enamelling Oven Heated by Single  Hot-water Pipes sealed at both ends with Furnace in Rear.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9--Japanning and Enamelling Oven For Bedstead,  Ironmongery, Cash-box, and Lamp Factories.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Japanning and Enamelling Stove for parts of  Sewing Machines.]    It will be seen from the various illustrations that the articles to be  treated are absolutely isolated from actual contact with the fire or  the fire gases and other impurities which must be an objection to all  methods of heating by means which are not of a purely mechanical  nature. This principle not only recommends itself as scientifically  correct and suited to the purpose in view, but is also a very simple  and practical one. It affords the means of applying the heat at the  point where it is required to do the work without unduly heating  parts where heat is unnecessary; it secures absolute uniformity,  perfect continuity, and the highest possible fuel economy.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Japanning and Enamelling Stove for  Iron-Bedsteads and Household Ironmongery with Truck on Rails.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12--Permanent Japanning and Enamelling Stove for  Kitchen Utensils built in Masonry.]    The nature of the work to be executed in the different classes and  various sizes of stoves vary so greatly and indefinitely that only by  careful attention to the special requirements of each case, on the  part of the designers and constructors, is it possible to obtain the  most satisfactory results.    The arrangement of fixing the pipes round the lower walls of the room  in this form of stove is somewhat cumbersome, but in a roomy stove"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#6)"],[1,"office, and it had a door which he could close between himself  and the man that followed.    He hurried up the walk laid across the neat little grass plot, sent a  humbly grateful glance up to the stars-and-stripes that fluttered  lazily from the short flagstaff, and went in as though he had business  there, and as though that business was urgent.    A couple of young fellows at wide, document-littered desks looked up  at him with a mild curiosity, said good morning and waited with an air  of expectancy for him to state his errand. Under pretense of throwing  his cigarette outside, Jack turned and opened the door six inches or  so. The man who had followed him was going past, and he did not look  toward the house. He was busy reading a newspaper while he walked, but  he was not the tall man with the shrewd blue eyes and the knowing  little smile; which was some comfort to Jack. He closed the door and  turned again toward the two; and because he knew he must furnish some  plausible reason for his presence, he said the first thing that came  to his tongue--the thing that is always permissible and always  plausible.    \"Fellow told me I might get a job here. How about it?\" Then he smiled  good-naturedly and with a secret admiration for his perfect aplomb in  rising to the emergency.    \"You'll have to ask Supervisor Ross about that,\" said one. \"He's in  there.\" He turned his thumb toward the rear room, the door of which  stood wide open, and bent again over the map he had been studying. So  far as these two were concerned, Jack had evidently ceased to exist.  He went, therefore, to the room where the supervisor was at work  filling in a blank of some kind; and because his impromptu speech had  seemed to fill perfectly his requirements, he repeated it to Ross in  exactly the same tone of careless good nature, except that this time  he really meant part of it; because, when he came to think of it, he  really did want a job of some sort, and the very atmosphere of quiet,  unhurried efficiency that pervaded the place made him wish that he  might become a part of it.    It was a vagrant wish that might have died as quickly as it had been  born; an impulse that had no root in any previous consideration of the  matter. But Ross leaned back in his chair and was regarding him  seriously, as a possible employee of the government, and Jack  instinctively squared his shoulders to meet the look.    Followed a few questions, which Jack answered as truthfully as he  dared. Ross looked him over again and asked him how he would like to  be a fireman. Whereat Jack looked bewildered.    \"What I mean by that in this case,\" the supervisor explained, \"is that  I could put you up on Mount Hough, in the lookout station. That's--do  you know anything at all about the Forest Service, young fellow?\"    Jack blushed, gulped down a lie and came out with the truth. \"I got  in this morning,\" he said. \"I don't know a darned thing about it, but  I want to get to work at something. And I guess I can learn anything  that isn't too complicated.\"    Ross laughed to himself. \"About the most complicated thing you'll have  to learn,\" he said, \"is how to put in your time. It's hard to get a  man that will stay at lookout stations. Lonesome--that's all. It's  about as bad as being a sheepherder, only you won't have any sheep for  company. Up on Mount Hough you'll have to live in a little glass house  about the size of this room, and do your cooking on an oil stove. Your  work will be watching your district for fires, and reporting them  here--by phone. There's a man up there now, but he doesn't want to  stay. He's been hollering for some one to take his place. You're  entitled to four days relief a month--when we send up a man to take  your place. Aside from that you'll have to stay right up on that peak,  and watch for fires. The fellow up there will show you how to use the  chart and locate fires so you can tell us exactly where it is that you  see smoke. You can't leave except when you're given permission and  some one comes to take your place. We send up your supplies and mail  once a week on a pack horse. Your pay will be seventy dollars a month.    \"I don't want you to take it unless you feel pretty sure you can  stick. I'm tired of sending men up there for a week or two and having  them phoning in here a dozen times a day about how lonesome it is,  then quitting cold. We can't undertake to furnish you with amusement,  and we are too busy to spend the day gossiping with you over the phone  just to help you pass the time.\" He snapped his mouth together as  though he meant every word of it and a great deal more. \"Do you want  the job?\" he asked grimly.    Jack heard a chuckle from the next room, and his own lips came  together with a snap.    \"Lead me to it,\" he said cheerfully. \"I'd stand on my head and point  the wind with my legs for seventy dollars a month! Sounds to me like a  good place to save money--what?\"    \"Don't know how you'd go about spending much as long as you stayed up  there,\" Ross retorted drily. \"It's when a man comes down that his  wages begin to melt.\"    Jack considered this point, standing with his feet planted a little  apart and his hands in his pockets, which is the accepted pose of the  care-free scion of wealth who is about to distinguish himself. He  believed that he knew best how to ward off suspicion of his motives in  thus exiling himself to a mountain top. He therefore grinned amiably  at Ross.    \"Well, then, I won't come down,\" he stated calmly. \"What I'm looking  for is a chance to make some money without any chance of spending it.  Lead me to this said mountain with the seventy-dollar job holding down  the peak.\"    Ross looked at him dubiously as though he detected a false note  somewhere. Good looking young fellows with the tangible air of the  towns and easy living did not, as a rule, take kindly to living alone  on some mountain peak. He stared up into Jack's face unwinkingly,  seeking there the real purpose behind such easy acceptance.    Jack stared back, his eyes widening and sobering a little as he  discovered that this man was not so easily put off with laughing  evasion. He wondered if Ross had read the papers that morning, and if  he, like the tall man at the postoffice, was mentally fitting him into  the description of the auto bandit that was being trailed.  Instinctively he rose to the new emergency.    \"On the level, I want work and I want it right away,\" he said. \"Being  alone won't bother me--I always get along pretty well with myself. I  want to get ahead of the game about five hundred dollars, and this  looks to me like a good chance to pile up a few iron men. I'm game for  the lonesomeness. It's a cold dollars-and-cents proposition with me.\"  He stopped and eyed the other a minute. \"Does that answer what's in  your mind?\" he asked bluntly.    Forest Supervisor Ross turned away his glance and reached for his pen.  \"That's all right,\" he half apologized. \"I want you to understand what  you're going up against, that is all. What's your name?\"    Having the question launched at him suddenly like that, Jack nearly  blurted out his own name from sheer force of habit. But his tongue was  his friend for once and pronounced the last word so that Ross wrote  \"John Carew\" without hesitation. And Jack Corey, glancing down as the  supervisor wrote, stifled a smile of satisfaction.    \"It happens to be the day when we usually send up supplies,\" said Ross  when he had finished recording the fact of Jack's employment as  fireman. \"Our man hasn't started yet, and you can go up with him. Come  back here in an hour, can you? There'll be a saddle horse for you.  Don't try to take too much baggage. Suitcase, maybe. You can phone  down for anything you need that you haven't got with you, you know. It  will go up next trip. Clothes and grub and tobacco and such as  that--use your own judgment, and common sense.\"    \"All right. Er--thank you, sir.\" Jack blushed a bit over the  unaccustomed courtesy of his tone, and turned into the outer office.    \"Oh--Carew! Don't fall into the fool habit of throwing rocks down into  the lake just to see them bounce! One fellow did that, and came near  getting a tourist. You'll have to be careful.\"    \"I certainly will, Mr. Ross.\"    The other two men gave him a friendly nod, and Jack went out of the  office feeling almost as cheerful as he had tried to appear.          CHAPTER FIVE    \"IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY,\" SANG JACK      Riding at a steady, climbing walk up a winding road cut into the  wooded mountainside; with a pack-horse loaded with food and new, cheap  bedding which Jack had bought; with chipmunks scurrying over the tree  trunks that had gone crashing down in some storm and were gathering  moss on their rotting bark; with the clear, yellow sunlight of a  mountain day in spring lying soft on the upper branches, Jack had a  queer sense of riding up into a new, untroubled life that could hold  no shred of that from which he had fled. His mother, stately in her  silks and a serenely unapproachable manner, which seemed always to say  to her son that she was preoccupied with her own affairs, and that her  affairs were vastly more important than his youthful interests and  problems, swam vaguely before his consciousness, veiled by the swift  passing of events and the abrupt change from city to unspoiled  wilderness.    When his companion stopped to let the horses \"get their wind,\" Jack  would turn in the saddle and look back over the network of gulches  and deep canyons to where the valley peeped up at him shyly through  the trees, and would think that every step made him that much safer.  He did not face calmly the terror from which he had fled. Still  mentally breathless from the very unexpectedness of the catastrophe,  he shrank from the thought of it as if thinking would betray him. He  had not so far concerned himself with his future, except as it held  the"]]]
