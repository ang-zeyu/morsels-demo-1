We have also seen that, weak as he is in  individuality, it is not his private and personal emotions that tend to  become ritual, but those that are public, felt and expressed officially,  that is, by the whole tribe or community. It is further obvious that  such dances, when they develop into actual rites, tend to be performed  at fixed times. We have now to consider when and why. The element of  fixity and regular repetition in rites cannot be too strongly  emphasized. It is a factor of paramount importance, essential to the  development from ritual to art, from _dromenon_ to drama.    The two great interests of primitive man are food and children. As Dr.  Frazer has well said, if man the individual is to live he must have  food; if his race is to persist he must have children. \"To live and to  cause to live, to eat food and to beget children, these were the primary  wants of man in the past, and they will be the primary wants of men in  the future so long as the world lasts.\" Other things may be added to  enrich and beautify human life, but, unless these wants are first  satisfied, humanity itself must cease to exist. These two things,  therefore, food and children, were what men chiefly sought to procure by  the performance of magical rites for the regulation of the seasons. They  are the very foundation-stones of that ritual from which art, if we are  right, took its rise. From this need for food sprang seasonal, periodic  festivals. The fact that festivals are seasonal, constantly recurrent,  solidifies, makes permanent, and as already explained (p. 42), in a  sense intellectualizes and abstracts the emotion that prompts them.    The seasons are indeed only of value to primitive man because they are  related, as he swiftly and necessarily finds out, to his food supply.  He has, it would seem, little sensitiveness to the aesthetic impulse of  the beauty of a spring morning, to the pathos of autumn. What he  realizes first and foremost is, that at certain times the animals, and  still more the plants, which form his food, appear, at certain others  they disappear. It is these times that become the central points, the  focuses of his interest, and the dates of his religious festivals. These  dates will vary, of course, in different countries and in different  climates. It is, therefore, idle to attempt a study of the ritual of a  people without knowing the facts of their climate and surroundings. In  Egypt the food supply will depend on the rise and fall of the Nile, and  on this rise and fall will depend the ritual and calendar of Osiris. And  yet treatises on Egyptian religion are still to be found which begin by  recounting the rites and mythology of Osiris, as though these were  primary, and then end with a corollary to the effect that these rites  and this calendar were \"associated\" with the worship of Osiris, or, even  worse still, \"instituted by\" the religion of Osiris. The Nile regulates  the food supply of Egypt, the monsoon that of certain South Pacific  islands; the calendar of Egypt depends on the Nile, of the South  Pacific islands on the monsoon.           *       *       *       *       *    In his recent _Introduction to Mathematics_[7] Dr. Whitehead has pointed  out how the \"whole life of Nature is dominated by the existence of  periodic events.\" The rotation of the earth produces successive days;  the path of the earth round the sun leads to the yearly recurrence of  the seasons; the phases of the moon are recurrent, and though artificial  light has made these phases pass almost unnoticed to-day, in climates  where the skies are clear, human life was largely influenced by  moonlight. Even our own bodily life, with its recurrent heart-beats and  breathings, is essentially periodic.[8] The presupposition of  periodicity is indeed fundamental to our very conception of life, and  but for periodicity the very means of measuring time as a quantity would  be absent.    Periodicity is fundamental to certain departments of mathematics, that  is evident; it is perhaps less evident that periodicity is a factor that  has gone to the making of ritual, and hence, as we shall see, of art.  And yet this is manifestly the case. All primitive calendars are ritual  calendars, successions of feast-days, a patchwork of days of different  quality and character recurring; pattern at least is based on  periodicity. But there is another and perhaps more important way in  which periodicity affects and in a sense causes ritual. We have seen  already that out of the space between an impulse and a reaction there  arises an idea or \"presentation.\" A \"presentation\" is, indeed, it would  seem, in its final analysis, only a delayed, intensified desire--a  desire of which the active satisfaction is blocked, and which runs over  into a \"presentation.\" An image conceived \"presented,\" what we call an  _idea_ is, as it were, an act prefigured.    Ritual acts, then, which depend on the periodicity of the seasons are  acts necessarily delayed. The thing delayed, expected, waited for, is  more and more a source of value, more and more apt to precipitate into  what we call an idea, which is in reality but the projected shadow of an  unaccomplished action. More beautiful it may be, but comparatively  bloodless, yet capable in its turn of acting as an initial motor impulse  in the cycle of activity. It will later (p. 70) be seen that these  periodic festivals are the stuff of which those faded, unaccomplished  actions and desires which we call gods--Attis, Osiris, Dionysos--are  made.           *       *       *       *       *    To primitive man, as we have seen, beast and bird and plant and himself  were not sharply divided, and the periodicity of the seasons was for  all. It will depend on man's social and geographical conditions whether  he notices periodicity most in plants or animals. If he is nomadic he  will note the recurrent births of other animals and of human children,  and will connect them with the lunar year. But it is at once evident  that, at least in Mediterranean lands, and probably everywhere, it is  the periodicity of plants and vegetation generally which depends on  moisture, that is most striking. Plants die down in the heat of summer,  trees shed their leaves in autumn, all Nature sleeps or dies in winter,  and awakes in spring.    Sometimes it is the dying down that attracts most attention. This is  very clear in the rites of Adonis, which are, though he rises again,  essentially rites of lamentation. The details of the ritual show this  clearly, and specially as already seen in the cult of Osiris. For the  \"gardens\" of Adonis the women took baskets or pots filled with earth,  and in them, as children sow cress now-a-days, they planted wheat,  fennel, lettuce, and various kinds of flowers, which they watered and  tended for eight days. In hot countries the seeds sprang up rapidly, but  as the plants had no roots they withered quickly away. At the end of the  eight days they were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis and  thrown with them into the sea or into springs. The \"gardens\" of Adonis  became the type of transient loveliness and swift decay.           *       *       *       *       *    \"What waste would it be,\" says Plutarch,[9] \"what inconceivable waste,  for God to create man, had he not an immortal soul. He would be like the  women who make little gardens, not less pleasant than the gardens of  Adonis in earthen pots and pans; so would our souls blossom and flourish  but for a day in a soft and tender body of flesh without any firm and  solid root of life, and then be blasted and put out in a moment.\"    Celebrated at midsummer as they were, and as the \"gardens\" were thrown  into water, it is probable that the rites of Adonis may have been, at  least in part, a rain-charm. In the long summer droughts of Palestine  and Babylonia the longing for rain must often have been intense enough  to provoke expression, and we remember (p. 19) that the Sumerian Tammuz  was originally _Dumuzi-absu_, \"True Son of the Waters.\" Water is the  first need for vegetation. Gardens of Adonis are still in use in the  Madras Presidency.[10] At the marriage of a Brahman \"seeds of five or  nine sorts are mixed and sown in earthen pots which are made specially  for the purpose, and are filled with earth. Bride and bridegroom water  the seeds both morning and evening for four days; and on the fifth day  the seedlings are thrown, like the real gardens of Adonis, into a tank  or river.\"    Seasonal festivals with one and the same intent--the promotion of  fertility in plants, animals and man--may occur at almost any time of  the year. At midsummer, as we have seen, we may have rain-charms; in  autumn we shall have harvest festivals; in late autumn and early winter  among pastoral peoples we shall have festivals, like that of Martinmas,  for the blessing and purification of flocks and herds when they come in  from their summer pasture. In midwinter there will be a Christmas  festival to promote and protect the sun's heat at the winter solstice.  But in Southern Europe, to which we mainly owe our drama and our art,  the festival most widely celebrated, and that of which we know most, is  the Spring Festival, and to that we must turn. The spring is to the  Greek of to-day the \"anoixis,\" \"the Opening,\" and it was in spring and  with rites of spring that both Greek and Roman originally began their  year. It was this spring festival that gave to the Greek their god  Dionysos and in part his drama.           *       *       *       *       *    In Cambridge on May Day two or three puzzled and weary little boys and  girls are still to be sometimes seen dragging round a perambulator with  a doll on it bedecked with ribbons and a flower or two.

It is  true that they had not traversed more than three degrees of latitude,  but, although their progress was slow, their time was well spent. De  Monts was satisfied that it would be easier to colonize Acadia than this  American coast, and Champlain was still convinced that Port Royal was  the most favourable spot, unless de Monts preferred Quebec.    The expedition returned to Ste. Croix in nine days, arriving there on  August 3rd. Here they found a vessel from France, under the command of  Captain des Antons, laden with provisions, and many things suitable for  winter use. There was now a chance of saving the settlers, although  their position was not enviable.    De Monts was determined to try the climate of Port Royal, and to  endeavour to establish a settlement there. Two barques were fitted out  and laden with the frame work of the buildings at Ste. Croix. Champlain  and Pont-Grave had set out before to select a favourable site around the  bay, well sheltered from the north-west wind. They chose a place  opposite an island at the mouth of the river de l'Equille, as being the  most suitable. Every one was soon busily engaged in clearing the ground  and in erecting houses. The plan of the settlement, says Champlain, was  ten fathoms long and eight fathoms wide, making the distance around  thirty-six fathoms. On the eastern side was a storehouse occupying the  width of it, with a very fine cellar, from five to six feet deep. On the  northern side were the quarters of Sieur de Monts, comfortably finished.  In the backyard were the dwellings of the workmen. At the corner of the  western side was a platform, upon which four cannon were placed, and at  the eastern corner a palisade was constructed in the shape of a  platform. There was nothing pretentious or elegant about these  buildings, but they were solid and useful.    The installation of the new settlement being now complete, de Monts  returned to France, leaving Pont-Grave in command. During the absence of  de Monts, Champlain determined to pursue his discoveries along the  American coast, and in this design he was favoured by de Monts, as the  latter had not altogether abandoned his idea of settling in Florida. The  season, however, was too far advanced, and Champlain therefore stopped  at the river St. John to meet Schoudon, with whom he agreed to set out  in search of the famous copper mine. They were accompanied by a miner  named Jacques, and a Slavonian very skilful in discovering minerals. He  found some pieces of copper and what appeared to be a mine, but it was  too difficult to work. Champlain accordingly returned to Port Royal,  where several of the men were suffering from scurvy. Out of forty-five,  twelve died during the winter. The surgeon from Honfleur, named  Deschamps, performed an autopsy on some of the bodies, and found them  affected in the same manner as those who had died at Ste. Croix. Snow  did not fall until December 20th, and the winter was not so severe as  the previous one.    On March 16th, 1606, Champlain resumed his explorations, and travelled  eighteen leagues on that day. He anchored at an island to the south of  Manan. During the night his barque ran ashore and sustained injuries  which it required four days to repair. Champlain then proceeded to Port  aux Coquilles, seven or eight leagues distant, where he remained until  the twenty-ninth. Pont-Grave, however, desired him to return to Port  Royal, being anxious to obtain news of his companions whom he had left  sick. Owing to indisposition, Champlain was obliged to delay his  departure until April 8th.    Champlain and Pont-Grave intended to return to France during the summer  of 1606. Seeing that the vessels promised by de Monts had not arrived,  they set out from Port Royal to Cape Breton or Gaspe, in search of a  vessel to cross the Atlantic, but when they were approaching Canseau,  they met Ralleau, the secretary of de Monts, who informed them that a  vessel had been despatched under the command of Poutrincourt, with  fifty settlers for the country. They, therefore, returned to Port Royal,  where they found Poutrincourt, who as lieutenant-general of de Monts  intended to remain at Port Royal during the year.    On September 5th, Champlain left Port Royal on a voyage of discovery.  Poutrincourt joined the expedition, and they took with them a physician,  the carpenter Champdore, and Robert Grave, the son of Francois. This  last voyage, undertaken to please de Monts, did not result in anything  remarkable. They first paid a visit to Ste. Croix, where everything  remained unchanged, although the gardens were flourishing. From Ste.  Croix the expedition drifted southwards, and Champlain pointed out the  same bays, harbours, capes and mountains that he had observed before.  Schoudon, chief of the Etchemins, and Messamouet, captain of the  Micmacs, joined the party, and proceeded with them as far as Chouacouet,  where they intended to form an alliance with Olmechin and Marchim, two  Indian chiefs of this country.    On October 2nd, 1606, the expedition reached Mallebarre, and for a few  days they anchored in a bay near Cape Batturier, which they named Port  Fortune (Chatham). Five or six hundred savages were found at this place.  \"It would be an excellent place,\" says Champlain, \"to erect buildings,  and lay the foundation of a state, if the harbour was somewhat deeper  and the entrance safer.\" Poutrincourt stopped here for some days, and  in the meantime visited all the surrounding country, from which he  returned much pleased.    According to a custom peculiar to the French since the days of Jacques  Cartier, de Monts had planted a large cross at the entrance of the  Kennebec River, and also at Mallebarre. Poutrincourt did the same at  Port Fortune. The Indians seemed annoyed at this ceremony, which they  evidently considered as an encroachment upon their rights as  proprietors. They exhibited symptoms of discontent, and during the night  they killed four Frenchmen who had imprudently stayed ashore. They were  buried near the cross. This the Indians immediately threw down, but  Poutrincourt ordered it to be restored to its former position.    On three different occasions the party attempted to pursue their  discoveries southwards, but they were prevented each time by a contrary  wind. They therefore resolved to return to Port Royal, which was  rendered imperative both by the approach of winter and the scarcity of  provisions. The result of the voyage was not altogether satisfactory.  Champlain had perhaps held a degree further south than on the former  occasion, but he had not discovered anything of importance.    On their return to Port Royal, the voyagers were received with great  ceremony. Lescarbot, a Parisian lawyer, who had arrived some time  before, and some other Frenchmen, went to meet them and conducted them  to the fort, which had been decorated with evergreens and inscriptions.  On the principal door they had placed the arms of France, surrounded  with laurel crowns, and the king's motto: _Duo protegit unus_. Beneath  the arms of de Monts was placed this inscription: _Dabit Deus his quoque  finem_. The arms of Poutrincourt were wreathed with crowns of leaves,  with his motto: _In via virtuti nulla est via_. Lescarbot had composed a  short drama for the occasion, entitled, _Le Theatre de Neptune_.    The winter of 1606-07 was not very severe. The settlers lived happily in  spite of the scurvy, from which some of them died. Hunting afforded them  the means of providing a great variety of dishes, such as geese, ducks,  bears, beavers, partridges, reindeer, bustards, etc. They also organized  a society devoted to good cheer called, _Ordre du Bon Temps_, the  by-laws of which were definite, and were fixed by Champlain himself. The  Indians of the vicinity who were friendly towards the French colony were  in need of food, so that each day loaves of bread were distributed  amongst them. Their _sagamo_, named Membertou, was admitted as a guest  to the table of Poutrincourt. This famous Souriquois, who was very old  at that time--probably a hundred years, though he had not a single white  hair--pretended to have known Jacques Cartier at the time of his first  voyage, and claimed that in 1534 he was married, and the father of a  young family.    Lescarbot, who was an able man and a good historian, records the  particulars above related, besides many other interesting facts  concerning Port Royal which appear to have escaped Champlain's  observation. Lescarbot was an active spirit in the life of the first  French colony in Acadia. He encouraged his companions to cultivate their  land, and he worked himself in the gardens, sowing wheat, oats, beans,  pease, and herbs, which he tended with care. He was also liked by the  Indians, and he would have rejoiced to see them converted to  Christianity. Lescarbot was a poet and a preacher, and had also a good  knowledge of the arts and of medicine. Charlevoix says: \"He daily  invented something new for the public good. And there was never a  stronger proof of what a new settlement might derive from a mind  cultivated by study, and induced by patriotism to use its knowledge and  reflections. We are indebted to this advocate for the best memoirs of  what passed before his eyes, and for a history of French Florida. We  then behold an exact and judicious writer, a man with views of his own,  and who would have been as capable of founding a colony as of writing  its history.\"    With the departure of Lescarbot and Champlain the best page of the  history of Port Royal is closed. The two men left on September 2nd,  1607, on board the _Jonas_, commanded by Nicholas Martin. They stopped  at Roscoff in Basse-Bretagne, and the vessel arrived at Havre de Grace  in the early days of October.    Poutrincourt, his son Biencourt, and Lescarbot made a pilgrimage to Mont  St. Michel, and Champlain went"]]]
