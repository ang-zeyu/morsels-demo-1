He it is Who hath  laid bare before you the hidden and treasured Gem, were ye to seek it. He  it is Who is the one Beloved of all things, whether of the past or of the  future. Would that ye might set your hearts and hopes upon Him!    We have heard the voice of thy pleading, O Pen, and excuse thy silence.  What is it that hath so sorely bewildered thee?    The inebriation of Thy presence, O Well-Beloved of all worlds, hath seized  and possessed me.    Arise, and proclaim unto the entire creation the tidings that He Who is  the All-Merciful hath directed His steps towards the Ridvan and entered  it. Guide, then, the people unto the garden of delight which God hath made  the Throne of His Paradise. We have chosen thee to be our most mighty  Trumpet, whose blast is to signalize the resurrection of all mankind.    Say: This is the Paradise on whose foliage the wine of utterance hath  imprinted the testimony: \"He that was hidden from the eyes of men is  revealed, girded with sovereignty and power!\" This is the Paradise, the  rustling of whose leaves proclaims: \"O ye that inhabit the heavens and the  earth! There hath appeared what hath never previously appeared. He Who,  from everlasting, had concealed His Face from the sight of creation is now  come.\" From the whispering breeze that wafteth amidst its branches there  cometh the cry: \"He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is made manifest. The  Kingdom is God's,\" while from its streaming waters can be heard the  murmur: \"All eyes are gladdened, for He Whom none hath beheld, Whose  secret no one hath discovered, hath lifted the veil of glory, and  uncovered the countenance of Beauty.\"    Within this Paradise, and from the heights of its loftiest chambers, the  Maids of Heaven have cried out and shouted: \"Rejoice, ye dwellers of the  realms above, for the fingers of Him Who is the Ancient of Days are  ringing, in the name of the All-Glorious, the Most Great Bell, in the  midmost heart of the heavens. The hands of bounty have borne round the cup  of everlasting life. Approach, and quaff your fill. Drink with healthy  relish, O ye that are the very incarnations of longing, ye who are the  embodiments of vehement desire!\"    This is the Day whereon He Who is the Revealer of the names of God hath  stepped out of the Tabernacle of glory, and proclaimed unto all who are in  the heavens and all who are on the earth: \"Put away the cups of Paradise  and all the life-giving waters they contain, for lo, the people of Baha  have entered the blissful abode of the Divine Presence, and quaffed the  wine of reunion, from the chalice of the beauty of their Lord, the  All-Possessing, the Most High.\"    Forget the world of creation, O Pen, and turn thou towards the face of thy  Lord, the Lord of all names. Adorn, then, the world with the ornament of  the favors of thy Lord, the King of everlasting days. For We perceive the  fragrance of the Day whereon He Who is the Desire of all nations hath shed  upon the kingdoms of the unseen and of the seen the splendor of the light  of His most excellent names, and enveloped them with the radiance of the  luminaries of His most gracious favors--favors which none can reckon except  Him, Who is the omnipotent Protector of the entire creation.    Look not upon the creatures of God except with the eye of kindliness and  of mercy, for Our loving providence hath pervaded all created things, and  Our grace encompassed the earth and the heavens. This is the Day whereon  the true servants of God partake of the life-giving waters of reunion, the  Day whereon those that are nigh unto Him are able to drink of the  soft-flowing river of immortality, and they who believe in His unity, the  wine of His Presence, through their recognition of Him Who is the Highest  and Last End of all, in Whom the Tongue of Majesty and Glory voiceth the  call: \"The Kingdom is Mine. I, Myself, am, of Mine own right, its Ruler.\"    Attract the hearts of men, through the call of Him, the one alone Beloved.  Say: This is the Voice of God, if ye do but hearken. This is the Day  Spring of the Revelation of God, did ye but know it. This is the  Dawning-Place of the Cause of God, were ye to recognize it. This is the  Source of the commandment of God, did ye but judge it fairly. This is the  manifest and hidden Secret; would that ye might perceive it. O peoples of  the world! Cast away, in My name that transcendeth all other names, the  things ye possess, and immerse yourselves in this Ocean in whose depths  lay hidden the pearls of wisdom and of utterance, an ocean that surgeth in  My name, the All-Merciful. Thus instructeth you He with Whom is the Mother  Book.    The Best-Beloved is come. In His right hand is the sealed Wine of His  name. Happy is the man that turneth unto Him, and drinketh his fill, and  exclaimeth: \"Praise be to Thee, O Revealer of the signs of God!\" By the  righteousness of the Almighty! Every hidden thing hath been manifested  through the power of truth. All the favors of God have been sent down, as  a token of His grace. The waters of everlasting life have, in their  fullness, been proffered unto men. Every single cup hath been borne round  by the hand of the Well-Beloved. Draw near, and tarry not, though it be  for one short moment.    Blessed are they that have soared on the wings of detachment and attained  the station which, as ordained by God, overshadoweth the entire creation,  whom neither the vain imaginations of the learned, nor the multitude of  the hosts of the earth have succeeded in deflecting from His Cause. Who is  there among you, O people, who will renounce the world, and draw nigh unto  God, the Lord of all names? Where is he to be found who, through the power  of My name that transcendeth all created things, will cast away the things  that men possess, and cling, with all his might, to the things which God,  the Knower of the unseen and of the seen, hath bidden him observe? Thus  hath His bounty been sent down unto men, His testimony fulfilled, and His  proof shone forth above the Horizon of mercy. Rich is the prize that shall  be won by him who hath believed and exclaimed: \"Lauded art Thou, O Beloved  of all worlds! Magnified be Thy name, O Thou the Desire of every  understanding heart!\"    Rejoice with exceeding gladness, O people of Baha, as ye call to  remembrance the Day of supreme felicity, the Day whereon the Tongue of the  Ancient of Days hath spoken, as He departed from His House, proceeding to  the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of  His name, the All-Merciful. God is Our witness. Were We to reveal the  hidden secrets of that Day, all they that dwell on earth and in the  heavens would swoon away and die, except such as will be preserved by God,  the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Such is the inebriating effect of the words of God upon Him Who is the  Revealer of His undoubted proofs, that His Pen can move no longer. With  these words He concludeth His Tablet: \"No God is there but Me, the Most  Exalted, the Most Powerful, the Most Excellent, the All-Knowing.\"            XV: THE PEN OF REVELATION EXCLAIMETH: \"ON THIS...      The Pen of Revelation exclaimeth: \"On this Day the Kingdom is God's!\" The  Tongue of Power is calling: \"On this Day all sovereignty is, in very deed,  with God!\" The Phoenix of the realms above crieth out from the immortal  Branch: \"The glory of all greatness belongeth to God, the Incomparable,  the All-Compelling!\" The Mystic Dove proclaimeth from its blissful bower,  in the everlasting Paradise: \"The source of all bounty is derived, in this  Day, from God, the One, the Forgiving!\" The Bird of the Throne warbleth  its melody in its retreats of holiness: \"Supreme ascendancy is to be  attributed, this Day, to none except God, Him Who hath no peer nor equal,  Who is the Most Powerful, the All-Subduing!\" The inmost essence of all  things voiceth in all things the testimony: \"All forgiveness floweth, in  this Day, from God, Him to Whom none can compare, with Whom no partners  can be joined, the Sovereign Protector of all men, and the Concealer of  their sins!\" The Quintessence of Glory hath lifted up its voice above My  head, and crieth from such heights as neither pen nor tongue can in any  degree describe: \"God is my witness! He, the Ancient of everlasting days  is come, girded with majesty and power. There is none other God but Him,  the All-Glorious, the Almighty, the All-Highest, the All-Wise, the  All-Pervading, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed, the Sovereign Protector,  the Source of eternal light!\"    O My servant, who hast sought the good-pleasure of God and clung to His  love on the Day when all except a few who were endued with insight have  broken away from Him! May God, through His grace, recompense thee with a  generous, an incorruptible and everlasting reward, inasmuch as thou hast  sought Him on the Day when eyes were blinded. Know thou that if We reveal  to thee but a sprinkling of the showers which, through God's decree, and  at the hands of the envious and the malicious, have rained upon Us, thou  wouldst weep with a great weeping, and wouldst bewail day and night Our  plight. Oh, would that a discerning and fair-minded soul could be found  who would recognize the wonders of this Revelation--wonders that proclaim  the sovereignty of God and the greatness of its power. Would that such a  man might arise and, wholly for the sake of God, admonish, privately and  openly, the people, that haply they may bestir themselves and aid this  wronged One Whom the workers of iniquity have so sorely afflicted.    Methinks that I hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit calling from behind Me  saying: Vary Thou Thy theme, and alter Thy tone, lest the heart of him who  hath fixed his gaze upon Thy face be saddened.

With the hands of loving-kindness I  have...\"      O DWELLERS OF MY PARADISE! With the hands of loving-kindness I have  planted in the holy garden of paradise the young tree of your love and  friendship, and have watered it with the goodly showers of My tender  grace; now that the hour of its fruiting is come, strive that it may be  protected, and be not consumed with the flame of desire and passion.        \"35: O MY FRIENDS! Quench ye the lamp of error, and kindle within...\"      O MY FRIENDS! Quench ye the lamp of error, and kindle within your hearts  the everlasting torch of divine guidance. For ere long the assayers of  mankind shall, in the holy presence of the Adored, accept naught but  purest virtue and deeds of stainless holiness.        \"36: O SON OF DUST! The wise are they that speak not unless they...\"      O SON OF DUST! The wise are they that speak not unless they obtain a  hearing, even as the cup-bearer, who proffereth not his cup till he  findeth a seeker, and the lover who crieth not out from the depths of his  heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved. Wherefore sow the  seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure soil of the heart, and keep them  hidden, till the hyacinths of divine wisdom spring from the heart and not  from mire and clay.        \"37: O MY SERVANT! Abandon not for that which perisheth an everlasting...\"      In the first line of the Tablet it is recorded and written, and within the  sanctuary of the tabernacle of God is hidden: O MY SERVANT! Abandon not  for that which perisheth an everlasting dominion, and cast not away  celestial sovereignty for a worldly desire. This is the river of  everlasting life that hath flowed from the well-spring of the pen of the  merciful; well is it with them that drink!        \"38: O SON OF SPIRIT! Burst thy cage asunder, and even as the phoenix...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! Burst thy cage asunder, and even as the phoenix of love  soar into the firmament of holiness. Renounce thyself and, filled with the  spirit of mercy, abide in the realm of celestial sanctity.        \"39: O OFFSPRING OF DUST! Be not content with the ease of a passing  day,...\"      O OFFSPRING OF DUST! Be not content with the ease of a passing day, and  deprive not thyself of everlasting rest. Barter not the garden of eternal  delight for the dust-heap of a mortal world. Up from thy prison ascend  unto the glorious meads above, and from thy mortal cage wing thy flight  unto the paradise of the Placeless.        \"40: O MY SERVANT! Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and...\"      O MY SERVANT! Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and loose thy  soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will come to thee  no more.        \"41: O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Didst thou behold immortal sovereignty,  thou...\"      O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Didst thou behold immortal sovereignty, thou wouldst  strive to pass from this fleeting world. But to conceal the one from thee  and to reveal the other is a mystery which none but the pure in heart can  comprehend.        \"42: O MY SERVANT! Purge thy heart from malice and, innocent of...\"      O MY SERVANT! Purge thy heart from malice and, innocent of envy, enter the  divine court of holiness.        \"43: O MY FRIENDS! Walk ye in the ways of the good pleasure of...\"      O MY FRIENDS! Walk ye in the ways of the good pleasure of the Friend, and  know that His pleasure is in the pleasure of His creatures. That is: no  man should enter the house of his friend save at his friend's pleasure,  nor lay hands upon his treasures nor prefer his own will to his friend's,  and in no wise seek an advantage over him. Ponder this, ye that have  insight!        \"44: O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not  thyself,...\"      O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not  thyself, neither sigh and weep. Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear  it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own  faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that  thine own abasement be not exposed. Live then the days of thy life, that  are less than a fleeting moment, with thy mind stainless, thy heart  unsullied, thy thoughts pure, and thy nature sanctified, so that, free and  content, thou mayest put away this mortal frame, and repair unto the  mystic paradise and abide in the eternal kingdom for evermore.        \"45: ALAS! ALAS! O LOVERS OF WORLDLY DESIRE!...\"      ALAS! ALAS! O LOVERS OF WORLDLY DESIRE! Even as the swiftness of lightning  ye have passed by the Beloved One, and have set your hearts on satanic  fancies. Ye bow the knee before your vain imagining, and call it truth. Ye  turn your eyes towards the thorn, and name it a flower. Not a pure breath  have ye breathed, nor hath the breeze of detachment been wafted from the  meadows of your hearts. Ye have cast to the winds the loving counsels of  the Beloved and have effaced them utterly from the tablet of your hearts,  and even as the beasts of the field, ye move and have your being within  the pastures of desire and passion.        \"46: O BRETHREN IN THE PATH! Wherefore have ye neglected the mention of  the...\"      O BRETHREN IN THE PATH! Wherefore have ye neglected the mention of the  Loved One, and kept remote from His holy presence? The essence of beauty  is within the peerless pavilion, set upon the throne of glory, whilst ye  busy yourselves with idle contentions. The sweet savors of holiness are  breathing and the breath of bounty is wafted, yet ye are all sorely  afflicted and deprived thereof. Alas for you and for them that walk in  your ways and follow in your footsteps!        \"47: O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! Put away the garment of vainglory, and  divest...\"      O CHILDREN OF DESIRE! Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest  yourselves of the attire of haughtiness.        \"48: O BRETHREN! Be forbearing one with another and set not your...\"      In the third of the most holy lines writ and recorded in the Ruby Tablet  by the pen of the unseen this is revealed: O BRETHREN! Be forbearing one  with another and set not your affections on things below. Pride not  yourselves in your glory, and be not ashamed of abasement. By My beauty! I  have created all things from dust, and to dust will I return them again.        \"49: O CHILDREN OF DUST! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the  poor,...\"      O CHILDREN OF DUST! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor,  lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them  of the Tree of Wealth. To give and to be generous are attributes of Mine;  well is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues.        \"50: O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION! Put away all covetousness and seek  contentment;...\"      O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION! Put away all covetousness and seek contentment;  for the covetous hath ever been deprived, and the contented hath ever been  loved and praised.        \"51: O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Be not troubled in poverty nor confident in...\"      O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Be not troubled in poverty nor confident in riches,  for poverty is followed by riches, and riches are followed by poverty. Yet  to be poor in all save God is a wondrous gift, belittle not the value  thereof, for in the end it will make thee rich in God, and thus thou shalt  know the meaning of the utterance, \"In truth ye are the poor,\" and the  holy words, \"God is the all-possessing,\" shall even as the true morn break  forth gloriously resplendent upon the horizon of the lover's heart, and  abide secure on the throne of wealth.        \"52: O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND PASSION!...\"      O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND PASSION! Ye have suffered My enemy to enter  My house and have cast out My friend, for ye have enshrined the love of  another than Me in your hearts. Give ear to the sayings of the Friend and  turn towards His paradise. Worldly friends, seeking their own good, appear  to love one the other, whereas the true Friend hath loved and doth love  you for your own sakes; indeed He hath suffered for your guidance  countless afflictions. Be not disloyal to such a Friend, nay rather hasten  unto Him. Such is the daystar of the word of truth and faithfulness, that  hath dawned above the horizon of the pen of the Lord of all names. Open  your ears that ye may hearken unto the word of God, the Help in peril, the  Self-existent.        \"53: O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES!...\"      O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES! Know ye in truth that wealth  is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his desire, the lover and his  beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise attain the court of His  presence nor enter the city of content and resignation. Well is it then  with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches from the eternal  kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion. By the Most Great  Name! The splendor of such a wealthy man shall illuminate the dwellers of  heaven even as the sun enlightens the people of the earth!        \"54: O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! The poor in your midst are My trust; guard  ye...\"      O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH! The poor in your midst are My trust; guard ye My  trust, and be not intent only on your own ease.        \"55: O SON OF PASSION! Cleanse thyself from the defilement of riches...\"      O SON OF PASSION! Cleanse thyself from the defilement of riches and in  perfect peace advance into the realm of poverty; that from the well-spring  of detachment thou mayest quaff the wine of immortal life.        \"56: O MY SON! The company of the ungodly increaseth sorrow,...\"      O MY SON! The company of the ungodly increaseth sorrow, whilst fellowship  with the righteous cleanseth the rust from off the heart. He that seeketh  to commune with God, let him betake himself to the companionship of His  loved ones; and he that desireth to hearken unto the word "]]]
