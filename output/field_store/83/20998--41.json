Thou seest how black darkness is enshrouding all regions,  how all countries are burning with the flame of dissension, and the fire  of war and carnage is blazing throughout the East and the West. Blood is  flowing, corpses bestrew the ground, and severed heads are fallen on the  dust of the battlefield.    O Lord! Have pity on these ignorant ones and look upon them with the eye  of forgiveness and pardon. Extinguish this fire, so that these dense  clouds which obscure the horizon may be scattered, the Sun of Reality  shine forth with the rays of conciliation, this intense gloom be dispelled  and the resplendent light of peace shed its radiance upon all countries.    O Lord! Draw up the people from the abyss of the ocean of hatred and  enmity, and deliver them from this impenetrable darkness. Unite their  hearts, and brighten their eyes with the light of peace and  reconciliation. Deliver them from the depths of war and bloodshed, and  free them from the darkness of error. Remove the veil from their eyes, and  enlighten their hearts with the light of guidance. Treat them with Thy  tender mercy and compassion, and deal not with them according to Thy  justice and wrath which cause the limbs of the mighty to quake.    O Lord! Wars have persisted. Distress and anxiety have waxed great and  every flourishing region is laid waste.    O Lord! Hearts are heavy, and souls are in anguish. Have mercy on these  poor souls and do not leave them to the excesses of their own desires.    O Lord! Make manifest in Thy lands humble and submissive souls, their  faces illumined with the rays of guidance, severed from the world,  extolling Thy Name, uttering Thy praise, and diffusing the fragrance of  Thy holiness amongst mankind.    O Lord! Strengthen their backs, gird up their loins, and enrapture their  hearts with the most mighty signs of Thy love.    O Lord! Verily, they are weak, and Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty;  they are impotent, and Thou art the Helper and the Merciful.    O Lord! The ocean of rebellion is surging, and these tempests will not be  stilled save through Thy boundless grace which hath embraced all regions.    O Lord! Verily, the people are in the abyss of passion, and naught can  save them but Thine infinite bounties.    O Lord! Dispel the darkness of these corrupt desires, and illumine the  hearts with the lamp of Thy love through which all countries will erelong  be enlightened. Confirm, moreover, Thy loved ones, those who, leaving  their homelands, their families and their children, have, for the love of  Thy Beauty, traveled to foreign countries to diffuse Thy fragrances and  promulgate Thy teachings. Be Thou their companion in their loneliness,  their helper in a strange land, the remover of their sorrows, their  comforter in calamity. Be Thou a refreshing draught for their thirst, a  healing medicine for their ills and a balm for the burning ardor of their  hearts.    Verily, Thou art the Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding, and,  verily, Thou art the Compassionate and the Merciful.            9: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE NORTHEASTERN STATES      _Revealed on February 2, 1917, in Isma'il Aqa's room at the house of  'Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa, and addressed to the Baha'is of the nine  Northeastern States of the United States: Maine, Massachusetts, New  Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Jersey  and New York. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye real friends:    2 All countries, in the estimation of the one true God, are but one  country, and all cities and villages are on an equal footing. Neither  holds distinction over another. All of them are the fields of God and the  habitation of the souls of men. Through faith and certitude, and the  precedence achieved by one over another, however, the dweller conferreth  honor upon the dwelling, some of the countries achieve distinction, and  attain a preeminent position. For instance, notwithstanding that some of  the countries of Europe and of America are distinguished by, and surpass  other countries in, the salubrity of their climate, the wholesomeness of  their water, and the charm of their mountains, plains and prairies, yet  Palestine became the glory of all nations inasmuch as all the holy and  divine Manifestations, from the time of Abraham until the appearance of  the Seal of the Prophets (Muhammad), have lived in, or migrated to, or  traveled through, that country. Likewise, Mecca and Medina have achieved  illimitable glory, as the light of Prophethood shone forth therein. For  this reason Palestine and Hijaz have been distinguished from all other  countries.    3 Likewise, the continent of America is, in the eyes of the one true God,  the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the  mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide  and the free assemble. Therefore, every section thereof is blessed: but  because these nine states have been favored in faith and assurance, hence  through this precedence they have obtained spiritual privilege. They must  realize the value of this bounty; because they have obtained such a favor  and in order to render thanksgiving for this most great bestowal, they  must arise in the diffusion of divine fragrances so that the blessed verse  of the Qur'an, \"God is the light of heaven and earth: the similitude of  His light is a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp is placed, and the lamp  enclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as if it were a shining  star. It is lighted with the oil of a Blessed Tree, an olive neither of  the East, nor of the West; it wanteth little but that the oil thereof  would give light, although no fire touched it. This is the light added  unto light. God will direct unto His light whom He pleaseth\"(14)--may be  realized.    4 He says: The world of nature is the world of darkness, because it is the  origin of a thousand depravities; nay, rather, it is darkness upon  darkness. The illumination of the world of nature is dependent upon the  splendor of the Sun of Reality. The grace of guidance is like unto the  candle which is enkindled in the glass of knowledge and wisdom and that  glass of knowledge and wisdom is the mirror of the heart of humanity. The  oil of that luminous lamp is from the fruits of the Blessed Tree and that  oil is so refined that it will burn without light. When the intensity of  the light and the translucency of the glass and the purity of the mirror  are brought together, it will become light upon light.    5 In brief, in these nine blessed states 'Abdu'l-Baha journeyed and  traveled from place to place, explained the wisdom of the heavenly books  and diffused the fragrances. In most of these states he founded the divine  Edifice and opened the door of teaching. In those states he sowed pure  seeds and planted blessed trees.    6 Now the believers of God and the maidservants of the Merciful must  irrigate these fields and with the utmost power engage themselves in the  cultivation of these heavenly plantations so that the seeds may grow and  develop, prosperity and blessing be realized and many rich and great  harvests be gathered in.    7 The Kingdom of God is like unto a farmer who comes into possession of a  piece of pure and virgin soil. Heavenly seeds are scattered therein, the  clouds of divine providence pour down and the rays of the Sun of Reality  shine forth.    8 Now all these bounties exist and appear in full in these nine states.  The divine Gardener passed by that holy ground and scattered pure seeds  from the lordly teachings in that field; the rain of the bounties of God  poured down and the heat of the Sun of Reality--that is, the merciful  confirmations--shone with the utmost splendor. It is my hope that each one  of those blessed souls may become a peerless and unique irrigator and the  East and the West of America may become like unto a delectable paradise so  that all of you may hear from the Supreme Concourse the cry of \"Blessed  are you, and again blessed are you!\"    9 Upon you be greeting and praise!    The following supplication is to be read by the teachers and friends  daily:    O THOU kind Lord! Praise be unto Thee that Thou hast shown us the highway  of guidance, opened the doors of the kingdom and manifested Thyself  through the Sun of Reality. To the blind Thou hast given sight; to the  deaf Thou hast granted hearing; Thou hast resuscitated the dead; Thou hast  enriched the poor; Thou hast shown the way to those who have gone astray;  Thou hast led those with parched lips to the fountain of guidance; Thou  hast suffered the thirsty fish to reach the ocean of reality; and Thou  hast invited the wandering birds to the rose garden of grace.    O Thou Almighty! We are Thy servants and Thy poor ones; we are remote and  yearn for Thy presence, are athirst for the water of Thy fountain, are  ill, longing for Thy healing. We are walking in Thy path and have no aim  or hope save the diffusion of Thy fragrance, so that all souls may raise  the cry: O God, \"Guide us to the straight path.\"(15) May their eyes be  opened to behold the light, and may they be freed from the darkness of  ignorance. May they gather around the lamp of Thy guidance. May every  portionless one receive a share. May the deprived become the confidants of  Thy mysteries.    O Almighty! Look upon us with the glance of mercifulness. Grant us  heavenly confirmation. Bestow upon us the breath of the Holy Spirit, so  that we may be assisted in Thy service and, like unto brilliant stars,  shine in these regions with the light of Thy guidance.    Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise and the Seeing.            10: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES      _Revealed on February 3, 1917, in Haifa in Isma'il Aqa's room, and  addressed to the Baha'is of the sixteen Southern States of the United  States: Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#6)"],[1," In the Iqan, Baha'u'llah, wishing to emphasize the transcendent character  of this new Day of God, reinforces the strength of His argument by His  reference to the text of a correct and authorized tradition, which reveals  the following: \"Knowledge is twenty and seven letters. All that the  Prophets have revealed are two letters thereof. No man thus far hath known  more than these two letters. But when the Qa'im shall arise, He will cause  the remaining twenty and five letters to be made manifest.\" And then  immediately follow these confirming and illuminating words of Baha'u'llah:  \"Consider: He hath declared knowledge to consist of twenty and seven  letters, and regarded all the prophets, from Adam even unto Muhammad, the  'seal,' as expounders of only two letters thereof. He also saith that the  Qa'im will reveal all the remaining twenty and five letters. Behold from  this utterance how great and lofty is His station! His rank excelleth that  of all the prophets, and His revelation transcendeth the comprehension and  understanding of all their chosen ones. A revelation, of which the  prophets of God, His saints and chosen ones have either not been informed  or which, in pursuance of God's inscrutable decree, they have not  disclosed--such a revelation, these vile and villainous people have sought  to measure with their own deficient minds, their own deficient learning  and understanding.\"    In another passage of the same Book, Baha'u'llah, referring to the  transformation effected by every Revelation in the ways, thoughts and  manners of the people, reveals these words: \"Is not the object of every  Revelation to effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind, a  transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and inwardly,  that shall affect both its inner life and external conditions? For if the  character of mankind be not changed, the futility of God's universal  Manifestations would be apparent.\"    Did not Christ Himself, addressing His disciples, utter these words: \"I  have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit  when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth\"?    From the text of this recognized tradition, as well as from the words of  Christ, as attested by the Gospel, every unprejudiced observer will  readily apprehend the magnitude of the Faith which Baha'u'llah has  revealed, and recognize the staggering weight of the claim He has  advanced. No wonder if 'Abdu'l-Baha has portrayed in such lurid colors the  fierceness of the agitation that shall center in the days to come round  the nascent institutions of the Faith. We can now but faintly discern the  beginnings of that turmoil which the rise and ascendancy of the Cause of  God is destined to cast in the world.          The Greatest Drama of the World's Spiritual History      Whether in the ferocious and insidious campaign of repression and cruelty  which the rulers of Russia have launched against the upholders of the  Faith under their rule; whether in the unyielding animosity with which the  Shiites of Islam are trampling upon the sacred rights of the adherents of  the Cause in connection with Baha'u'llah's house in Ba_gh_dad; whether in  the impotent rage which has impelled the ecclesiastical leaders of the  Sunnite sect of Islam to expel our Egyptian brethren from their midst--in  all of these we can perceive the manifestations of the relentless hate  which peoples, religions, and governments entertain for so pure, so  innocent, so glorious a Faith.    Ours is the duty to ponder these things in our heart, to strive to widen  our vision, and to deepen our comprehension of this Cause, and to arise,  resolutely and unreservedly, to play our part, however small, in this  greatest drama of the world's spiritual history.    Your brother and co-worker,  Shoghi.    Haifa, Palestine,  March 21, 1930.            THE GOAL OF A NEW WORLD ORDER          The Goal of a New World Order      Fellow-believers in the Faith of Baha'u'llah:    The inexorable march of recent events has carried humanity so near to the  goal foreshadowed by Baha'u'llah that no responsible follower of His  Faith, viewing on all sides the distressing evidences of the world's  travail, can remain unmoved at the thought of its approaching deliverance.    It would not seem inappropriate, at a time when we are commemorating the  world over the termination of the first decade since 'Abdu'l-Baha's sudden  removal from our midst, to ponder, in the light of the teachings  bequeathed by Him to the world, such events as have tended to hasten the  gradual emergence of the World Order anticipated by Baha'u'llah.    Ten years ago, this very day, there flashed upon the world the news of the  passing of Him Who alone, through the ennobling influence of His love,  strength and wisdom, could have proved its stay and solace in the many  afflictions it was destined to suffer.    How well we, the little band of His avowed supporters who lay claim to  have recognized the Light that shone within Him, can still remember His  repeated allusions, in the evening of His earthly life, to the tribulation  and turmoil with which an unregenerate humanity was to be increasingly  afflicted. How poignantly some of us can recall His pregnant remarks, in  the presence of the pilgrims and visitors who thronged His doors on the  morrow of the jubilant celebrations that greeted the termination of the  World War--a war, which by the horrors it evoked, the losses it entailed  and the complications it engendered, was destined to exert so far-reaching  an influence on the fortunes of mankind. How serenely, yet how powerfully,  He stressed the cruel deception which a Pact, hailed by peoples and  nations as the embodiment of triumphant justice and the unfailing  instrument of an abiding peace, held in store for an unrepented humanity.  Peace, Peace, how often we heard Him remark, the lips of potentates and  peoples unceasingly proclaim, whereas the fire of unquenched hatreds still  smoulders in their hearts. How often we heard Him raise His voice, whilst  the tumult of triumphant enthusiasm was still at its height and long  before the faintest misgivings could have been felt or expressed,  confidently declaring that the Document, extolled as the Charter of a  liberated humanity, contained within itself seeds of such bitter deception  as would further enslave the world. How abundant are now the evidences  that attest the perspicacity of His unerring judgment!    Ten years of unceasing turmoil, so laden with anguish, so fraught with  incalculable consequences to the future of civilization, have brought the  world to the verge of a calamity too awful to contemplate. Sad indeed is  the contrast between the manifestations of confident enthusiasm in which  the Plenipotentiaries at Versailles so freely indulged and the cry of  unconcealed distress which victors and vanquished alike are now raising in  the hour of bitter delusion.          A War-Weary World      Neither the force which the framers and guarantors of the Peace Treaties  have mustered, nor the lofty ideals which originally animated the author  of the Covenant of the League of Nations, have proved a sufficient bulwark  against the forces of internal disruption with which a structure so  laboriously contrived had been consistently assailed. Neither the  provisions of the so-called Settlement which the victorious Powers have  sought to impose, nor the machinery of an institution which America's  illustrious and far-seeing President had conceived, have proved, either in  conception or practice, adequate instruments to ensure the integrity of  the Order they had striven to establish. \"The ills from which the world  now suffers,\" wrote 'Abdu'l-Baha in January, 1920, \"will multiply; the  gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented.  Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers will continue to  agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of  war. Movements, newly-born and world-wide in their range, will exert their  utmost effort for the advancement of their designs. The Movement of the  Left will acquire great importance. Its influence will spread.\"    Economic distress, since those words were written, together with political  confusion, financial upheavals, religious restlessness and racial  animosities, seem to have conspired to add immeasurably to the burdens  under which an impoverished, a war-weary world is groaning. Such has been  the cumulative effect of these successive crises, following one another  with such bewildering rapidity, that the very foundations of society are  trembling. The world, to whichever continent we turn our gaze, to however  remote a region our survey may extend, is everywhere assailed by forces it  can neither explain nor control.    Europe, hitherto regarded as the cradle of a highly-vaunted civilization,  as the torch-bearer of liberty and the mainspring of the forces of world  industry and commerce, stands bewildered and paralyzed at the sight of so  tremendous an upheaval. Long-cherished ideals in the political no less  than in the economic sphere of human activity are being severely tested  under the pressure of reactionary forces on one hand and of an insidious  and persistent radicalism on the other. From the heart of Asia distant  rumblings, ominous and insistent, portend the steady onslaught of a creed  which, by its negation of God, His Laws and Principles, threatens to  disrupt the foundations of human society. The clamor of a nascent  nationalism, coupled with a recrudescence of skepticism and unbelief, come  as added misfortunes to a continent hitherto regarded as the symbol of  age-long stability and undisturbed resignation. From darkest Africa the  first stirrings of a conscious and determined revolt against the aims and  methods of political and economic imperialism can be increasingly"]]]
