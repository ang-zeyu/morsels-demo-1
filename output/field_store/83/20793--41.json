But for the great works, strewn thickly over the whole  valley of the Nile, the land of Egypt would have obtained but a small  share of the world's attention; and it is at least doubtful whether its  \"story\" would ever have been thought necessary to complete \"the Story of  the Nations.\"            FOOTNOTES:    [1] R. Stuart Poole, \"Cities of Egypt,\" p. 4.    [2] Translation by F.C. Cook.    [3] Adapted from Mr. Kinglake's \"Eothen,\" p. 188.          II.    THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT.      Where the Egyptians came from, is a difficult question to answer.  Ancient speculators, when they could not derive a people definitely from  any other, took refuge in the statement, or the figment, that they were  the children of the soil which they had always occupied. Modern  theorists may say, if it please them, that they were evolved out of the  monkeys that had their primitive abode on that particular portion of the  earth's surface. Monkeys, however, are not found everywhere; and we have  no evidence that in Egypt they were ever indigenous, though, as pets,  they were very common, the Egyptians delighting in keeping them. Such  evidence as we have reveals to us the man as anterior to the monkey in  the land of Mizraim Thus we are thrown back on the original  question--Where did the man, or race of men, that is found in Egypt at  the dawn of history come from?    It is generally answered that they came from Asia; but this is not much  more than a conjecture. The physical type of the Egyptians is different  from that of any known Asiatic nation. The Egyptians had no traditions  that at all connected them with Asia. Their language, indeed, in  historic times was partially Semitic, and allied to the Hebrew, the  Phoenician, and the Aramaic; but the relationship was remote, and may be  partly accounted for by later intercourse, without involving original  derivation. The fundamental character of the Egyptian in respect of  physical type, language, and tone of thought, is Nigritic. The Egyptians  were not negroes, but they bore a resemblance to the negro which is  indisputable. Their type differs from the Caucasian in exactly those  respects which when exaggerated produce the negro. They were darker, had  thicker lips, lower foreheads, larger heads, more advancing jaws, a  flatter foot, and a more attenuated frame. It is quite conceivable that  the negro type was produced by a gradual degeneration from that which we  find in Egypt. It is even conceivable that the Egyptian type was  produced by gradual advance and amelioration from that of the negro.    Still, whencesoever derived, the Egyptian people, as it existed in the  flourishing times of Egyptian history, was beyond all question a mixed  race, showing diverse affinities. Whatever the people was originally, it  received into it from time to time various foreign elements, and those  in such quantities as seriously to affect its physique--Ethiopians from  the south, Libyans from the west, Semites from the north-east, where  Africa adjoined on Asia. There are two quite different types of Egyptian  form and feature, blending together in the mass of the nation, but  strongly developed, and (so to speak) accentuated in individuals. One is  that which we see in portraits of Rameses III, and in some of Rameses  II.--a moderately high forehead, a large, well-formed aquiline nose, a  well-shaped mouth with lips not over full, and a delicately rounded  chin. The other is comparatively coarse--forehead low, nose depressed  and short, lower part of the face prognathous and sensual-looking, chin  heavy, jaw large, lips thick and projecting. The two types of face are  not, however, accompanied by much difference of frame. The Egyptian is  always slight in figure, wanting in muscle, flat in foot, with limbs  that are too long, too thin, too lady-like. Something more of  muscularity appears, perhaps, in the earlier than in the later forms;  but this is perhaps attributable to a modification of the artistic  ideal.    As Egypt presents us with two types of physique, so it brings before us  two strongly different types of character. On the one hand we see, alike  in the pictured scenes, in the native literary remains, and in the  accounts which foreigners have left us of the people, a grave and  dignified race, full of serious and sober thought, given to speculation  and reflection, occupied rather with the interests belonging to another  world than with those that attach to this present scene of existence,  and inclined to indulge in a gentle and dreamy melancholy. The first  thought of a king, when he began his reign, was to begin his tomb. The  desire of the grandee was similar. It is a trite tale how at feasts a  slave carried round to all the guests the representation of a mummied  corpse, and showed it to each in turn, with the solemn words--\"Look at  this, and so eat and drink; for be sure that one day such as this thou  shalt be.\" The favourite song of the Egyptians, according to Herodotus,  was a dirge. The \"Lay of Harper,\" which we subjoin, sounds a key-note  that was very familiar, at any rate, to large numbers among the  Egyptians.        The Great One[4] has gone to his rest,        Ended his task and his race;      Thus men are aye passing away,        And youths are aye taking their place.      As Ra rises up every morn,        And Turn every evening doth set,      So women conceive and bring forth,        And men without ceasing beget.      Each soul in its turn draweth breath--      Each man born of woman sees Death.        Take thy pleasure to-day,        Father! Holy One! See,      Spices and fragrant oils,        Father, we bring to thee.      On thy sister's bosom and arms        Wreaths of lotus we place;      On thy sister, dear to thy heart,        Aye sitting before thy face.      Sound the song; let music be played      And let cares behind thee be laid.        Take thy pleasure to-day;        Mind thee of joy and delight!      Soon life's pilgrimage ends,        And we pass to Silence and Night.      Patriarch perfect and pure,        Nefer-hotep, blessed one! Thou      Didst finish thy course upon earth,        And art with the blessed ones now.      Men pass to the Silent Shore,      And their place doth know them no more.        They are as they never had been,        Since the sun went forth upon high;      They sit on the banks of the stream        That floweth in stillness by.      Thy soul is among them; thou        Dost drink of the sacred tide,      Having the wish of thy heart--        At peace ever since thou hast died.      Give bread to the man who is poor,      And thy name shall be blest evermore.          *       *       *       *       *        Take thy pleasure to-day,        Nefer-hotep, blessed and pure.      What availed thee thy other buildings?        Of thy tomb alone thou art sure.      On the earth thou hast nought beside,        Nought of thee else is remaining;      And when thou wentest below,        Thy last sip of life thou wert draining.      Even they who have millions to spend,      Find that life comes at last to an end.        Let all, then, think of the day        Of departure without returning--      'Twill then be well to have lived,        All sin and injustice spurning.      For he who has loved the right,        In the hour that none can flee,      Enters upon the delight        Of a glad eternity.      Give freely from out thy store,      And thou shalt be blest evermore.    On the other hand, there is evidence of a lightsome, joyous, and even  frolic spirit as pervading numbers, especially among the lower classes  of the Egyptians. \"Traverse Egypt,\" says a writer who knows more of the  ancient country than almost any other living person, \"examine the scenes  sculptured or painted on the walls of the chapels attached to tombs,  consult the inscriptions graven on the rocks or traced with ink on the  papyrus rolls, and you will be compelled to modify your mistaken notion  of the Egyptians being a nation of philosophers. I defy you to find  anything more gay, more amusing, more freshly simple, than this  good-natured Egyptian people, which was fond of life and felt a profound  pleasure in its existence. Far from desiring death, they addressed  prayers to the gods to preserve them in life, and to give them a happy  old age--an old age that should reach, if possible, to the 'perfect term  of no years.' They gave themselves up to pleasures of every kind; they  sang, they drank, they danced, they delighted in making excursions into  the country, where hunting and fishing were occupations reserved  especially for the nobility. In conformity with this inclination towards  pleasure, sportive proposals, a pleasantry that was perhaps over-free,  witticisms, raillery, and a mocking spirit, were in vogue among the  people, and fun was allowed entrance even into the tombs. In the large  schools the masters had a difficulty in training the young and keeping  down their passion for amusements. When oral exhortation failed of  success, the cane was used pretty smartly in its place; for the wise men  of the land had a saying that 'a boy's ears grow on his back.'\"[5]    Herodotus tells us how gaily the Egyptians kept their festivals,  thousands of the common people--men, women, and children  together--crowding into the boats, which at such times covered the Nile,  the men piping, and the women clapping their hands or striking their  castanets, as they passed from town to town along the banks of the  stream, stopping at the various landing-places, and challenging the  inhabitants to a contest of good-humoured Billingsgate. From the  monuments we see how the men sang at their labours--here as they trod  the wine-press or the dough-trough, there as they threshed out the corn  by driving the oxen through the golden heaps. In one case the words of a  harvest-song have come down to us:        \"Thre"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#6)"],[1,"e_.        _age_.          _horse_.

The Plural of these nouns is regular, and always uniform.    Peculiarities of Inflection in the Second Declension.    25. 1. Proper names in -ius regularly form the Genitive Singular in -i  (instead of -ii), and the Vocative Singular in -i (for -ie); as Vergili,  _of Virgil_, or _O Virgil_ (instead of Vergilii, Vergilie). In such words  the accent stands upon the penult, even though that be short. Nouns in  -ajus, -ejus form the Gen. in -ai, -ei, as Pompejus, Pompei.    2. Nouns in -ius and -ium, until after the beginning of the reign of  Augustus (31 B.C.), regularly formed the Genitive Singular in -i (instead  of -ii); as,--      _Nom._  ingenium        filius    _Gen._  ingeni          fili    These Genitives accent the penult, even when it is short.    3. Filius forms the Vocative Singular in -i (for -ie); _viz_. fili, _O  son!_    4. Deus, _god_, lacks the Vocative Singular. The Plural is inflected as  follows:--      _Nom._  di              (dei)    _Gen._  deorum          (deum)    _Dat._  dis             (deis)    _Acc._  deos    _Voc._  di              (dei)    _Abl._  dis             (deis)    5. The Locative Singular ends in -i; as, Corinthi, _at Corinth_.    6. The Genitive Plural has -um, instead of -orum,--      a) in words denoting money and measure; as, talentum, _of talents_;    modium, _of pecks_; sestertium, _of sesterces_.      b) in duumvir, triumvir, decemvir; as, duumvirum.      c) sometimes in other words; as, liberum, _of the children_; socium, _of    the allies_.    Exceptions to Gender in the Second Declension.    26. 1. The following nouns in -us are Feminine by exception:--      a) Names of towns, islands, trees--according to the general rule laid    down in Sec. 15, 2; also some names of countries; as Aegyptus, _Egypt_.      b) Five special words,--        alvus, _belly_;      carbasus, _flax_;      colus, _distaff_;      humus, _ground_;      vannus, _winnowing-fan_.      c) A few Greek Feminines; as,--        atomus, _atom_;      diphthongus, _diphthong_.    2. The following nouns in -us are Neuter:--      pelagus, _sea_;    virus, _poison_;    vulgus, _crowd_.    Greek Nouns of the Second Declension.    27. These end in -os, -os, Masculine or Feminine; and -on, Neuter. They are  mainly proper names, and are declined as follows:--              Barbitos, m.    Androgeos, m.,  Ilion, n.,            and f.,         _Androgeos._    _Troy._            _lyre._    _Nom._  barbitos        Androgeos       Ilion    _Gen._  barbiti         Androgeo, -i    Ilii    _Dat._  barbito         Androgeo        Ilio    _Acc._  barbiton        Androgeo, -on   Ilion    _Voc._  barbite         Androgeos       Ilion    _Abl._  barbito         Androgeo        Ilio    1. Nouns in -os sometimes form the Accusative Singular in -um instead of  -on; as, Delum, _Delos_.    2. The Plural of Greek nouns, when it occurs, is usually regular.    3. For other rare forms of Greek nouns the lexicon may be consulted.           *       *       *       *       *    THIRD DECLENSION.    28. Nouns of the Third Declension end in -a, -e, -i, -o, -y, -c, -l, -n,  -r, -s, -t, -x. The Third Declension includes several distinct classes of  Stems,--        I.  Pure Consonant-Stems.     II.  i-Stems.    III.  Consonant-Stems which have partially adapted themselves to the          inflection of i-Stems.     IV.  A very few stems ending in a long vowel or a diphthong.      V.  Irregular Nouns.    I. Consonant-Stems.    29. 1. In these the stem appears in its unaltered form in all the oblique  cases, so that the actual case-endings may be clearly recognized.    2. Consonant-Stems fall into several natural subdivisions, according as the  stem ends in a Mute, Liquid, Nasal, or Spirant.    _A. Mute-Stems._    30. Mute-Stems may end,--    1. In a Labial (p); as, princep-s.    2. In a Guttural (g or c); as, remex (remeg-s); dux (duc-s).    3. In a Dental (d or t); as, lapis (lapid-s); miles (milet-s).    1.

STEMS IN A GUTTURAL MUTE (g, c).    32. In these the termination -s of the Nominative Singular unites with the  guttural, thus producing -x.                  Remex, m., _rower_.              Dux, c., _leader_.            SINGULAR.       PLURAL.         SINGULAR.

STEMS IN A DENTAL MUTE (d, t).    33. In these the final d or t of the stem disappears in the Nominative  Singular before the ending -s.                  Lapis, m., _stone_.

Masculine and Feminine stems ending in a liquid form the Nominative and  Vocative Singular without termination.    2. The termination is also lacking in the Nominative, Accusative and  Vocative Singular of all neuters of the Third Declension.    _C. Nasal Stems._    35. These end in -n,[13] which often disappears in the Nom. Sing.                    Leo, m., _lion_.               Nomen, n., _name_            SINGULAR.       PLURAL.         SINGULAR.

Note that the final s of the stem becomes r (between vowels) in the  oblique cases. In many words (honor, color, and the like) the r of the  oblique cases has, by analogy, crept into the Nominative, displacing the  earlier s, though the forms honos, colos, etc., also occur, particularly in  early Latin and in poetry.    II. i-Stems.    _A. Masculine and Feminine i-Stems._    37. These regularly end in -is in the Nominative Singular, and always have  -ium in the Genitive Plural. Originally the Accusative Singular ended in  -im, the Ablative Singular in -i, and the Accusative Plural in -is; but  these endings have been largely displaced by -em, -e, and -es, the endings  of Consonant-Stems.      38.
