The point which  they illustrate is his growing estrangement from his own people, which  in the very nature of the case must have had an important bearing upon  his Weltschmerz. But his feelings in regard to Germany and the Germans  were not all contempt. In many of his poems there is the true patriotic  ring. It is true, we can nowhere find any clear political program,  neither could we expect one from a poet who was so absorbed in his own  feelings, and whose ideals soared so high above the sphere of practical  politics. In this too Hoelderlin was the product of previous influences.  With all their clamor for political upheavals, the \"Stuermer und Draenger\"  never arrived at any serious or practical plan of action.  Notwithstanding all this, the word Vaterland was always an inspiration  to Hoelderlin, and it is especially gratifying to note that the calumny  which he heaps upon the devoted heads of the Germans is not his last  word on the subject. Nor did he ever lose sight of his lofty ideal of  liberty for his degraded fatherland or cease to hope for its  realization. In this strain he concludes the \"Hymne an die Freiheit\"  (1790) with a splendid outburst of patriotic enthusiasm:        Dann am suessen, heisserrung'nen Ziele,      Wenn der Ernte grosser Tag beginnt,      Wenn veroedet die Tyrannenstuehle,      Die Tyrannenknechte Moder sind,      Wenn im Heldenbunde meiner Brueder      Deutsches Blut und deutsche Liebe glueht,      Dann, O Himmelstochter! sing ich wieder,      Singe sterbend dir das letzte Lied.[50]    What a remarkable change is noticeable in the tone which the poet  assumes toward his country in the lines \"Gesang des Deutschen,\" written  in 1799, probably after the completion of his \"Hyperion\":        O heilig Herz der Voelker, O Vaterland!      Allduldend gleich der schweigenden Muttererd'      Und allverkannt, wenn schon aus deiner      Tiefe die Fremden ihr Bestes haben.        Du Land des hohen, ernsteren Genius!      Du Land der Liebe! bin ich der Deine schon,      Oft zuernt' ich weinend, dass du immer      Bloede die eigene Seele leugnest.[51]    How much the reproach has been softened, and with what tender regard he  strives to mollify his former bitterness! To this change in his  feelings, his sojourn in strange places and the attendant  discouragements and disappointments seem to have contributed not a  little, for in the poem \"Rueckkehr in die Heimat,\" written in 1800, the  contempt of \"Hyperion\" has been replaced by compassion. He sees himself  and his country linked together in the sacred companionship of  suffering, consequently it can no longer be the object of his scorn.        Wie lange ist's, O wie lange! des Kindes Ruh'      Ist hin, und hin ist Jugend, und Lieb' und Glueck,      Doch du, mein Vaterland! du heilig      Duldendes! siehe, du bist geblieben.[52]    But the fact remains, nevertheless, that Hoelderlin from his early youth  felt himself a stranger in his own land and among his own people. Some  of the causes of this circumstance have already been discussed. The fact  itself is important because it establishes the connection between his  Weltschmerz and his most noteworthy characteristic as a poet, namely,  his Hellenism. No other German poet has allowed himself to be so  completely dominated by the Greek idea as did Hoelderlin. And in his case  it may properly be called a symptom of his Weltschmerz, for it marks his  flight from the world of stern reality into an imaginary world of Greek  ideals. An imaginary Greek world, because in spite of his Hellenic  enthusiasm he entertained some of the most un-Hellenic ideas and  feelings.    That the poet should take refuge in Greek antiquity is not surprising,  when we consider the conditions which prevailed at that time in the  field of learning. It was not many decades since the study of Latin and  Roman institutions had been forced to yield preeminence of position in  Germany to the study of Greek. Furthermore, his own Suabia had come to  be recognized as a leader in the study of Greek antiquity, and in his  contemporaries Schiller, Hegel, Schelling, who were all countrymen and  acquaintances of his, he found worthy competitors in this branch of  learning. His fondness for the language and literature of Greece goes  back to his early school days, especially at Denkendorf and Maulbronn.  On leaving the latter school, he had the reputation among his  fellow-students of being an excellent Hellenist, according to the report  of Schwab, his biographer. It was while there that Hoelderlin as a boy  of seventeen first made use of the Alcaic measure in which he  subsequently wrote so many of his poems.    A full discussion of the technic of Hoelderlin's poems would have so  remote a connection with the main topic under consideration that its  introduction here would be entirely out of place. It will suffice,  therefore, merely to indicate along broad lines the extent to which the  Greek idea took and held possession of the poet.    Out of his 168 shorter poems, 126, exactly three-fourths, are written in  the unrhymed Greek measures.[53] Those forms which are native are  confined almost entirely to his juvenile and youthful compositions, and  after 1797 he only once employs the rhymed stanza, namely, in the poem  \"An Landauer.\"[54] As a boy of sixteen, he wrote verses in the Alcaic  and Asclepiadeian measures,[55] and soon acquired a considerable mastery  over them. At seventeen he composed in the latter form his poem \"An  meine Freundinnen:\"        In der Stille der Nacht denket an euch mein Lied,      Wo mein ewiger Gram jeglichen Stundenschlag,      Welcher naeher mich bringt dem      Trauten Grabe, mit Dank begruesst.[56]    While not exhibiting the finish of expression and musical qualities of  his more mature Alcaic lyrics, still it is not bad poetry for a boy of  seventeen, and the reader feels what the boy was not slow to learn, that  the stately movement of the Greek stanzas lends an added dignity to the  expression of sorrow, which was to constitute so large a part of his  poetic activity. As already stated, the Alcaic measure was of all the  Greek verse-forms Hoelderlin's favorite, and the one most frequently and  successfully employed by him. He is very fond of introducing Germanic  alliteration into these unrhymed stanzas, as the following example will  illustrate:        Und wo sind Dichter, denen der Gott es gab,      Wie unsern Alten, freundlich und fromm zu sein,      Wo Weise, wie die unsern sind, die      Kalten und Kuehnen, die unbestechbarn?[57]    The Asclepiadeian stanza he employs much less frequently, the Sapphic  only once, and that with indifferent success. It was the ode, dithyramb  and hymn, the serious lyric, which Hoelderlin selected as the models for  his poetic fashion. In this purpose he was not alone, for his friend  Neuffer writes to him in 1793, with an enthusiasm which in the intensity  of expression common at the time, seems almost like an inspiration: \"Die  hoehere Ode und der Hymnus, zwei in unsern Tagen, und vielleicht in allen  Zeitaltern am meisten vernachlaessigte Musen! in ihre Arme wollen wir uns  werfen, von ihren Kuessen beseelt uns aufraffen. Welche Aussichten! Dein  Hymnus an die Kuehnheit mag Dir zum Motto dienen! Mir gehe die Hoffnung  voran.\"[58]    But it was in the form much more than in the contents of his poems, that  Hoelderlin carried out the Greek idea. Most of his lyrics are occasional  poems, or have abstract subjects, as for example, \"An die Stille,\" \"An  die Ehre,\" \"An den Genius der Kuehnheit,\" and so on. Only here and there  does he take a classic subject or introduce classic references. The  truth of the matter is, that with all his fervid enthusiasm for Hellenic  ideals, and with all his Greek cult, Hoelderlin was not the genuine  Hellenist he thought himself to be. This is due to the fact that his  turning to Greece was in its final analysis attributable rather to  selfish than to altruistic motives. He wanted to get away from the  deplorable realities about him, the things which hurt his tender soul,  and so he constructed for himself this idealized world of ancient and  modern Greece, and peopled it with his own creations.    In Hoelderlin's \"Hyperion,\" we have the first poetic work in German which  takes modern Greece as its locality and a modern Hellene as its hero.  Hoelderlin calls it \"ein Roman,\" but it would be rather inaccurately  described by the usual translation of that term. It is not only the  poetic climax of his Hellenism, but also the most complete expression of  his Weltschmerz in its various phases. It must naturally be both, for  the poet and the hero are one. He speaks of it as \"mein Werkchen, in dem  ich lebe und webe.\"[59] Its subject is the emancipation of Greece. What  little action is narrated may be very briefly indicated. Russia is at  war with Turkey and calls upon Hellas to liberate itself. The hero and  his friend Alabanda are at the head of a band of volunteers, fighting  the Turks.

CHAPTER IV.    THE PASTORAL MADONNA.      It was many centuries before art, at first devoted exclusively to  figure painting, turned to the study of natural scenery. Thus it was  that Madonna pictures, of various kinds, had long been established in  popular favor before the idea of a landscape setting was introduced.  We need not look for interesting pictures of this class before the  latter part of the fifteenth century, and it was not until the  sixteenth that the pastoral Madonna, in its highest form, was first  produced. Even then there was no great number which show a really  sympathetic love of nature.    In the ideal pastoral, the landscape entirely fills the picture, and  the figures are, as it were, an integral part of it. Such pictures are  so rare that we write in golden letters the names of the few who have  given us these treasures.    Raphael's justly comes first in the list. His earliest Madonnas show  his love of natural scenery, in the charming glimpses of Umbrian  landscape, which form the background. These are treated, as Muentz  points out, with marked \"simplicity of outline and breadth of design.\"  They are, however, but the beginning of the great things that were to  follow. The young painter's sojourn in Florence witnessed a marvellous  development of his powers. Here he was surrounded by the greatest  artists of his time, and he was quick to absorb into himself something  of excellence from them all. His fertility of production was amazing.  In a period of four years (1504-1508), interrupted by visits to  Perugia and Urbino, he produced about twenty Madonnas, in which we  may trace the new influences affecting him.    Leonardo da Vinci was, doubtless, his greatest inspiration, and it was  from this master-student of nature that the young man learned, with  new enthusiasm, the value of going directly to Nature herself. The  fruit of this new study is a group of lovely pastoral Madonnas, which  are entirely unique as Nature idyls. Three of these are among the  world's great favorites. They are, the Belle Jardiniere (The Beautiful  Gardener), of the Louvre Gallery, Paris; the Madonna in Gruenen (The  Madonna in the Meadow), in the Belvedere Gallery, Vienna; and the  Cardellino Madonna (The Madonna of the Goldfinch), of the Uffizi,  Florence.    We turn from one to another of these three beautiful pictures, always  in doubt as to which is the greatest. Fortunately, it is a question  which there is no occasion to decide, as every lover of art may be the  happy possessor of all three, in that highest mode of possession  attained by devoted study.    In each one we have the typical Tuscan landscape, filling the whole  picture with its tranquil beauty. The \"glad green earth\" blossoms with  dainty flowers; the fair blue sky above is reflected in the placid  surface of a lake. From its shores rise gently undulating hills, where  towers show the signs of happy activity. In the foreground of this  peaceful scene sits a beautiful woman with two charming children at  her knee. They belong to the landscape as naturally as the trees and  flowers; they partake of its tranquil, placid happiness.    [Illustration: RAPHAEL.--MADONNA IN THE MEADOW.]    Almost identical in general style of composition, the three pictures  show many points of dissimilarity when we come to a closer study of  the figures. Considered as a type of womanly beauty, the Belle  Jardiniere is perhaps the most commonplace of the three Virgins, or,  to put it negatively, the least attractive. She is distinctly of the  peasant class, gentle, amiable, and entirely unassuming. The Madonna  in the Meadow is a maturer woman, more dignified, more beautiful. The  smooth braids of her hair are coiled about the head, accentuating its  lovely outline. The falling mantle reveals the finely modelled  shoulders. The Madonna of the Goldfinch is a still higher type of  loveliness, uniting with gentle dignity a certain delicate, high-bred  grace, which Raphael alone could impart. Her face is charmingly framed  in the soft hair which falls modestly about it. One wonders if any  modern _coiffeur_ could invent so many styles of hair dressing as does  this gifted young painter of the sixteenth century.    Turning from the mother to the children, we find the same general  types repeated in the three pictures, but with some difference of  _motif_. The Christ-child of the Belle Jardiniere is looking up fondly  to his mother. In the Vienna picture he is eagerly interested in the  cross which the little St. John gives him. In the Uffizi picture he is  more serious, and strokes the goldfinch with an air of abstraction,  meditating on the holy things his mother has been reading to him.    The arrangement of the three figures is the same in all the pictures,  and is so entirely simple that we forget the greatness of the art. The  Virgin, dominating the composition, brings into unity the two smaller  figures. This unity is somewhat less perfect in the Belle Jardiniere,  because the little St. John is almost neglected in the intense  absorption of mother and child in each other.    Once again, in the later days at Rome, Raphael recurred to the  pastoral Madonna type of this Florentine period, and painted the  picture known as the Casa Alba Madonna. We have again the same smiling  landscape and the same charming children, but a Virgin of an  altogether new order. A turbaned Roman beauty of superb, Juno-like  physique, she does not belong to the idyllic character of her  surroundings. It is as if some brilliant exotic had been transplanted  from her native haunts to quiet fields, where hitherto the modest lily  had bloomed alone.    As Raphael's first inspiration for the pastoral Madonna came from the  influence of Leonardo da Vinci, it is of interest to compare his work  with that of the great Lombard himself. Critics tell us that the  Madonna pictures in which he came nearest to his model are the Madonna  in the Meadow and the Holy Family of the Lamb. (Madrid.) These we may  place beside the Madonna of the Rocks, which is the only entirely  authentic Da Vinci Madonna which we have.    It is only the skilled connoisseur who, in travelling from Paris to  Vienna, and from Vienna to Madrid, can hold in memory the qualities of  technique which link together the three pictures; but for general  characteristics of composition, the black and white reproductions may  suffice. Leonardo availed himself of his intimate knowledge of Nature  to choose from her storehouse something which is unique rather than  typical. The rock grotto doubtless has a real counterpart, but we must  go far to find it. In the river, gleaming beyond, we see the painter's  characteristic treatment of water, which Raphael was glad to adopt.  The triangular arrangement of the figures, the relation of the Virgin  to the children, the simple, childish beauty of the latter, and their  attitude towards each other--all these points suggest the source of  Raphael's similar conceptions. The Virgin's hair falls over her  shoulders entirely unbound, in gentle, waving ripples.    [Illustration: LEONARDO DA VINCI.--MADONNA OF THE  ROCKS.]    We do not need to be told, though the historian has taken pains to  record it, that a feature of personal beauty by which Leonardo was  always greatly pleased was \"curled and waving hair.\" We see it in the  first touch of his hand when, as a boy in the workshop of Verrochio,  he painted the wavy-haired angel in his Master's Baptism; and here,  again, in the Virgin, we find it the crowning element of her  mysterious loveliness. We try in vain to penetrate the secret of her  smile,--it is as evasive as it is enchanting. And herein lies the  distinguishing difference between Leonardo and Raphael. The former is  always mysterious and subtle; the latter is always frank and  ingenuous. While both are true interpreters of nature, Leonardo  reveals the rare and inexplicable, Raphael chooses the typical and  familiar. Both are possessed of a strong sense of the harmony of  nature with human life. The smile of the Virgin of the Rocks is a part  of the mystery of her shadowy environment;[2] the serenity of the  Madonna in the Meadow belongs to the atmosphere of the open fields.    [Footnote 2: That the Leonardesque _smile_ requires a Leonardesque  _setting_ is seen, I think, in the pictures by Da Vinci's imitators.  The Madonna by Sodoma, recently added to the Brera Gallery at Milan,  is an example in point. Here the inevitable smile of mystery seems  meaningless in the sunny, open landscape.]    Among others who were affected by the influence of Leonardo--and chief  of the Lombards--was Luini. His pastoral Madonna has, however, little  in common with the landscapes of his master, judging from the lovely  example in the Brera. The group of figures is strikingly suggestive of  Da Vinci, but the quiet, rural pasture in which the Virgin sits is  Luini's own. In the distance is a thick clump of trees, finely drawn  in stem and branch. At one side is a shepherd's hut with a flock of  sheep grazing near. The child Jesus reaches from his mother's lap to  play with the lamb which the little St. John has brought, a _motif_  similar to Raphael's Madrid picture, and perhaps due, in both  painters, to the example of Leonardo.    It is said by the learned that during the period of the Renaissance  the love of nature received an immense impulse from the revival of the  Latin poets, and that this impulse was felt most in the large cities.  In the pictures noted, we have seen its effect in Florentine and  Lombard art; that it was also felt in isolated places, we may see in  some of Correggio's work at Parma, at about the same time. Two, at  least, of his Madonna pictures are as famous for their beautiful  landscapes as for the rare grace and charm of their figures. These are  the kneeling "]]]
