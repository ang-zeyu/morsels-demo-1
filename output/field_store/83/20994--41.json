Husayn _Kh_an, vindictive, relentless, exasperated by the reports  of his sleepless agents that his Captive's power and fame were hourly  growing, decided to take immediate action. It is even reported that his  accomplice, Haji Mirza Aqasi, had ordered him to kill secretly the  would-be disrupter of the state and the wrecker of its established  religion. By order of the governor the chief constable, 'Abdu'l-Hamid  _Kh_an, scaled, in the dead of night, the wall and entered the house of  Haji Mirza Siyyid 'Ali, where the Bab was confined, arrested Him, and  confiscated all His books and documents. That very night, however, took  place an event which, in its dramatic suddenness, was no doubt  providentially designed to confound the schemes of the plotters, and  enable the Object of their hatred to prolong His ministry and consummate  His Revelation. An outbreak of cholera, devastating in its virulence, had,  since midnight, already smitten above a hundred people. The dread of the  plague had entered every heart, and the inhabitants of the stricken city  were, amid shrieks of pain and grief, fleeing in confusion. Three of the  governor's domestics had already died. Members of his family were lying  dangerously ill. In his despair he, leaving the dead unburied, had fled to  a garden in the outskirts of the city. 'Abdu'l-Hamid _Kh_an, confronted by  this unexpected development, decided to conduct the Bab to His own home.  He was appalled, upon his arrival, to learn that his son lay in the  death-throes of the plague. In his despair he threw himself at the feet of  the Bab, begged to be forgiven, adjured Him not to visit upon the son the  sins of the father, and pledged his word to resign his post, and never  again to accept such a position. Finding that his prayer had been  answered, he addressed a plea to the governor begging him to release his  Captive, and thereby deflect the fatal course of this dire visitation.  Husayn _Kh_an acceded to his request, and released his Prisoner on  condition of His quitting the city.    Miraculously preserved by an almighty and watchful Providence, the Bab  proceeded to Isfahan (September, 1846), accompanied by Siyyid  Kazim-i-Zanjani. Another lull ensued, a brief period of comparative  tranquillity during which the Divine processes which had been set in  motion gathered further momentum, precipitating a series of events leading  to the imprisonment of the Bab in the fortresses of Mah-Ku and _Ch_ihriq,  and culminating in His martyrdom in the barrack-square of Tabriz. Well  aware of the impending trials that were to afflict Him, the Bab had, ere  His final separation from His family, bequeathed to His mother and His  wife all His possessions, had confided to the latter the secret of what  was to befall Him, and revealed for her a special prayer the reading of  which, He assured her, would resolve her perplexities and allay her  sorrows. The first forty days of His sojourn in Isfahan were spent as the  guest of Mirza Siyyid Muhammad, the Sultanu'l-'Ulama, the Imam-Jum'ih, one  of the principal ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm, in accordance  with the instructions of the governor of the city, Manu_ch_ihr _Kh_an, the  Mu Tamidu'd-Dawlih, who had received from the Bab a letter requesting him  to appoint the place where He should dwell. He was ceremoniously received,  and such was the spell He cast over the people of that city that, on one  occasion, after His return from the public bath, an eager multitude  clamored for the water that had been used for His ablutions. So magic was  His charm that His host, forgetful of the dignity of his high rank, was  wont to wait personally upon Him. It was at the request of this same  prelate that the Bab, one night, after supper, revealed His well-known  commentary on the surih of Va'l-'Asr. Writing with astonishing rapidity,  He, in a few hours, had devoted to the exposition of the significance of  only the first letter of that surih--a letter which _Sh_ay_kh_  Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i had stressed, and which Baha'u'llah refers to in the  Kitab-i-Aqdas--verses that equalled in number a third of the Qur'an, a feat  that called forth such an outburst of reverent astonishment from those who  witnessed it that they arose and kissed the hem of His robe.    The tumultuous enthusiasm of the people of Isfahan was meanwhile visibly  increasing. Crowds of people, some impelled by curiosity, others eager to  discover the truth, still others anxious to be healed of their  infirmities, flocked from every quarter of the city to the house of the  Imam-Jum'ih. The wise and judicious Manu_ch_ihr _Kh_an could not resist  the temptation of visiting so strange, so intriguing a Personage. Before a  brilliant assemblage of the most accomplished divines he, a Georgian by  origin and a Christian by birth, requested the Bab to expound and  demonstrate the truth of Muhammad's specific mission. To this request,  which those present had felt compelled to decline, the Bab readily  responded. In less than two hours, and in the space of fifty pages, He had  not only revealed a minute, a vigorous and original dissertation on this  noble theme, but had also linked it with both the coming of the Qa'im and  the return of the Imam Husayn--an exposition that prompted Manu_ch_ihr  _Kh_an to declare before that gathering his faith in the Prophet of Islam,  as well as his recognition of the supernatural gifts with which the Author  of so convincing a treatise was endowed.    These evidences of the growing ascendancy exercised by an unlearned Youth  on the governor and the people of a city rightly regarded as one of the  strongholds of _Sh_i'ah Islam, alarmed the ecclesiastical authorities.  Refraining from any act of open hostility which they knew full well would  defeat their purpose, they sought, by encouraging the circulation of the  wildest rumors, to induce the Grand Vizir of the _Sh_ah to save a  situation that was growing hourly more acute and menacing. The popularity  enjoyed by the Bab, His personal prestige, and the honors accorded Him by  His countrymen, had now reached their high watermark. The shadows of an  impending doom began to fast gather about Him. A series of tragedies from  then on followed in rapid sequence destined to culminate in His own death  and the apparent extinction of the influence of His Faith.    The overbearing and crafty Haji Mirza Aqasi, fearful lest the sway of the  Bab encompass his sovereign and thus seal his own doom, was aroused as  never before. Prompted by a suspicion that the Bab possessed the secret  sympathies of the Mu'tamid, and well aware of the confidence reposed in  him by the _Sh_ah, he severely upbraided the Imam-Jum'ih for the neglect  of his sacred duty. He, at the same time, lavished, in several letters,  his favors upon the 'ulamas of Isfahan, whom he had hitherto ignored. From  the pulpits of that city an incited clergy began to hurl vituperation and  calumny upon the Author of what was to them a hateful and much to be  feared heresy. The _Sh_ah himself was induced to summon the Bab to his  capital. Manu_ch_ihr _Kh_an, bidden to arrange for His departure, decided  to transfer His residence temporarily to his own home. Meanwhile the  mujtahids and 'ulamas, dismayed at the signs of so pervasive an influence,  summoned a gathering which issued an abusive document signed and sealed by  the ecclesiastical leaders of the city, denouncing the Bab as a heretic  and condemning Him to death. Even the Imam-Jum'ih was constrained to add  his written testimony that the Accused was devoid of reason and judgment.  The Mu'tamid, in his great embarrassment, and in order to appease the  rising tumult, conceived a plan whereby an increasingly restive populace  were made to believe that the Bab had left for Tihran, while he succeeded  in insuring for Him a brief respite of four months in the privacy of the  Imarat-i-_Kh_ur_sh_id, the governor's private residence in Isfahan. It was  in those days that the host expressed the desire to consecrate all his  possessions, evaluated by his contemporaries at no less than forty million  francs, to the furtherance of the interests of the new Faith, declared his  intention of converting Muhammad _Sh_ah, of inducing him to rid himself of  a shameful and profligate minister, and of obtaining his royal assent to  the marriage of one of his sisters with the Bab. The sudden death of the  Mu'tamid, however, foretold by the Bab Himself, accelerated the course of  the approaching crisis. The ruthless and rapacious Gurgin _Kh_an, the  deputy governor, induced the _Sh_ah to issue a second summons ordering  that the captive Youth be sent in disguise to Tihran, accompanied by a  mounted escort. To this written mandate of the sovereign the vile Gurgin  _Kh_an, who had previously discovered and destroyed the will of his uncle,  the Mu'tamid, and seized his property, unhesitatingly responded. At the  distance of less than thirty miles from the capital, however, in the  fortress of Kinar-Gird, a messenger delivered to Muhammad Big, who headed  the escort, a written order from Haji Mirza Aqasi instructing him to  proceed to Kulayn, and there await further instructions. This was, shortly  after, followed by a letter which the _Sh_ah had himself addressed to the  Bab, dated Rabi'u'_th_-_th_ani 1263 (March 19-April 17, 1847), and which,  though couched in courteous terms, clearly indicated the extent of the  baneful influence exercised by the Grand Vizir on his sovereign. The plans  so fondly cherished by Manu_ch_ihr _Kh_an were now utterly undone. The  fortress of Mah-Ku, not far from the village of that same name, whose  inhabitants had long enjoyed the patronage of the Grand Vizir, situated in  the remotest northwestern corner of A_dh_irbayjan, was the place of  incarceration assigned by Muhammad _Sh_ah, on the advice of his perfidious  minister, for the Bab.

The  mujtahid arranged a divorce, and wedded the girl to another man. When word  of this reached Ba_gh_dad, Isma'il, steadfast as ever, only laughed. \"God  be praised!\" he said. \"Nothing is left me on this pathway. I have lost  everything, including my bride. I have been able to give Him all I  possessed.\"    When Baha'u'llah departed from Ba_gh_dad, and traveled to Rumelia, the  friends remained behind. The inhabitants of Ba_gh_dad then rose up against  those helpless believers, sending them away as captives to Mosul. Ustad  was old and feeble, but he left on foot, with no provisions for his  journey, crossed over mountains and deserts, valleys and hills, and in the  end arrived at the Most Great Prison. At one time, Baha'u'llah had written  down an ode of Rumi's for him, and had told him to turn his face toward  the Bab and sing the words, set to a melody. And so as he wandered through  the long dark nights, Ustad would sing these lines:    I am lost, O Love, possessed and dazed,  Love's fool am I, in all the earth.  They call me first among the crazed,  Though I once came first for wit and worth.    O Love, who sellest me this wine,(13)  O Love, for whom I burn and bleed,  Love, for whom I cry and pine--  Thou the Piper, I the reed.    If Thou wishest me to live,  Through me blow Thy holy breath.  The touch of Jesus Thou wilt give  To me, who've lain an age in death.    Thou, both End and Origin,  Thou without and Thou within--  From every eye Thou hidest well,  And yet in every eye dost dwell.    He was like a bird with broken wings but he had the song and it kept him  going onward to his one true Love. By stealth, he approached the Fortress  and went in, but he was exhausted, spent. He remained for some days, and  came into the presence of Baha'u'llah, after which he was directed to look  for a lodging in Haifa. He got himself to Haifa, but he found no haven  there, no nest or hole, no water, no grain of corn. Finally he made his  home in a cave outside the town. He acquired a little tray and on this he  set out rings of earthenware, and some thimbles, pins and other trinkets.  Every day, from morning till noon, he peddled these, wandering about. Some  days his earnings would amount to twenty paras,(14) some days thirty; and  forty on his best days. Then he would go home to the cave and content  himself with a piece of bread. He was always voicing his thanks, always  saying, \"Praise be to God that I have attained such favor and grace; that  I have been separated from friend and stranger alike, and have taken  refuge in this cave. Now I am of those who gave their all, to buy the  Divine Joseph in the market place. What bounty could be any greater than  this!\"    Such was his condition, when he died. Many and many a time, Baha'u'llah  was heard to express His satisfaction with Ustad Isma'il. Blessings hemmed  him round, and the eye of God was on him. Salutations be unto him, and  praise. Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.            NABIL-I-ZARANDI      Still another of those who emigrated from their native land to be near  Baha'u'llah was the great Nabil.(15) In the flower of youth he bade  farewell to his family in Zarand and with Divine aid began to teach the  Faith. He became a chief of the army of lovers, and on his quest he left  Persian 'Iraq for Mesopotamia, but could not find the One he sought. For  the Well-Beloved was then in Kurdistan, living in a cave at Sar-Galu; and  there, entirely alone in that wasteland, with no companion, no friend, no  listening soul, He was communing with the beauty that dwelt in His own  heart. All news of Him was completely cut off; 'Iraq was eclipsed, and in  mourning.    When Nabil discovered that the flame which had once been kindled and  tended there was almost out, that the believers were few, that Yahya(16)  had crawled into a secret hole where he lay torpid and inert, and that a  wintry cold had taken over--he found himself obliged to leave, bitterly  grieving, for Karbila. There he stayed until the Blessed Beauty returned  from Kurdistan, making His way to Ba_gh_dad. At that time there was  boundless joy; every believer in the country sprang to life; among them  was Nabil, who hastened to the presence of Baha'u'llah, and became the  recipient of great bestowals. He spent his days in gladness now, writing  odes to celebrate the praises of his Lord. He was a gifted poet, and his  tongue most eloquent; a man of mettle, and on fire with passionate love.    After a time he returned to Karbila, then came back to Ba_gh_dad and from  there went on to Persia. Because he associated with Siyyid Muhammad he was  led into error and sorely afflicted and tried; but like the shooting  stars, he became as a missile to drive off satanic imaginings,(17) and he  repulsed the evil whisperers and went back to Ba_gh_dad, where he found  rest in the shade of the Holy Tree. He was later directed to visit  Kirman_sh_ah. He returned again, and on every journey was enabled to  render a service.    Baha'u'llah and His retinue then left Ba_gh_dad, the \"Abode of Peace,\" for  Constantinople, the \"City of Islam.\" After His departure, Nabil put on the  dress of a dervish, and set out on foot, catching up with the convoy along  the way. In Constantinople he was directed to return to Persia and there  teach the Cause of God; also to travel throughout the country, and  acquaint the believers in its cities and villages with all that had taken  place. When this mission was accomplished, and the drums of \"Am I not your  Lord?\" were rolling out--for it was the \"year eighty\"(18)-- Nabil hurried to  Adrianople, crying as he went, \"Yea verily Thou art! Yea verily!\" and  \"Lord, Lord, here am I!\"    He entered Baha'u'llah's presence and drank of the red wine of allegiance  and homage. He was then given specific orders to travel everywhere, and in  every region to raise the call that God was now made manifest: to spread  the blissful tidings that the Sun of Truth had risen. He was truly on  fire, driven by restive love. With great fervor he would pass through a  country, bringing this best of all messages and reviving the hearts. He  flamed like a torch in every company, he was the star of every assemblage,  to all who came he held out the intoxicating cup. He journeyed as to the  beat of drums and at last he reached the Akka fortress.    In those days the restrictions were exceptionally severe. The gates were  shut, the roads closed off. Wearing a disguise, Nabil arrived at the Akka  gate. Siyyid Muhammad and his wretched accomplice immediately hurried to  the Governorate and informed against the traveler. \"He is a Persian,\" they  reported. \"He is not, as he seems, a man of Bu_kh_ara. He has come here to  seek for news of Baha'u'llah.\" The authorities expelled him at once.    Nabil, despairing, withdrew to the town of Safad. Later he came on to  Haifa, where he made his home in a cave on Mount Carmel. He lived apart  from friend and stranger alike, lamenting night and day, moaning and  chanting prayers. There he remained as a recluse, and waited for the doors  to open. When the predestined time of captivity was over, and the gates  were flung wide, and the Wronged One issued forth in beauty, in majesty  and glory, Nabil hastened to Him with a joyful heart. Then he used himself  up like a candle, burning away with the love of God. Day and night he sang  the praises of the one Beloved of both worlds and of those about His  threshold, writing verses in the pentameter and hexameter forms, composing  lyrics and long odes. Almost daily, he was admitted to the presence of the  Manifestation.(19)    This went on until the day Baha'u'llah ascended. At that supreme  affliction, that shattering calamity, Nabil sobbed and trembled and cried  out to Heaven. He found that the numerical value of the word  \"_sh_idad\"--year of stress--was 309, and it thus became evident that  Baha'u'llah foretold what had now come to pass.(20)    Utterly cast down, hopeless at being separated from Baha'u'llah, fevered,  shedding tears, Nabil was in such anguish that anyone seeing him was  bewildered. He struggled on, but the only desire he had was to lay down  his life. He could suffer no longer; his longing was aflame in him; he  could stand the fiery pain no more. And so he became king of the cohorts  of love, and he rushed into the sea.    Before that day when he offered himself up, he wrote out the year of his  death in the one word: \"Drowned.\"(21) Then he threw down his life for the  Well-Beloved, and was released from his despair, and no longer shut away.    This distinguished man was erudite, wise, and eloquent of speech. His  native genius was pure inspiration, his poetic gift like a crystal stream.  In particular his ode \"Baha, Baha!\" was written in sheer ecstasy.  Throughout all his life, from earliest youth till he was feeble and old,  he spent his time serving and worshiping the Lord. He bore hardships, he  lived through misfortunes, he suffered afflictions. From the lips of the  Manifestation he heard marvelous things. He was shown the lights of  Paradise; he won his dearest wish. And at the end, when the Daystar of the  world had set, he could endure no more, and flung himself into the sea.  The waters of sacrifice closed over him; he was drowned, and he came, at  last, to the Most High.    Upon him be abundant blessings; upon him be tender mercies. May he win a  great victory, and a manifest grace in the Kingdom of God.            DARVISH SIDQ-'ALI      Aqa Sidq-'Ali was yet one more of those who left their native land,  journeyed to Baha'u'llah and were put in the Prison. He was a dervish; a  man who lived free and detached from friend and stranger alike. He  belonged to the mystic element and was a man of letters. He spent some  time wearing the dress of poverty, drinking the wine of the Rule and "]]]
