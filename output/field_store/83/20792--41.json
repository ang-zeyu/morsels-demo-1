'Ah, good old Horace!' said Sallust, compassionately; 'he sang well of  feasts and girls, but not like our modern poets.'    'The immortal Fulvius, for instance,' said Clodius.    'Ah, Fulvius, the immortal!' said the umbra.    'And Spuraena; and Caius Mutius, who wrote three epics in a year--could  Horace do that, or Virgil either said Lepidus.  'Those old poets all  fell into the mistake of copying sculpture instead of painting.  Simplicity and repose--that was their notion; but we moderns have fire,  and passion, and energy--we never sleep, we imitate the colors of  painting, its life, and its action.  Immortal Fulvius!'    'By the way,' said Sallust, 'have you seen the new ode by Spuraena, in  honour of our Egyptian Isis?  It is magnificent--the true religious  fervor.'    'Isis seems a favorite divinity at Pompeii,' said Glaucus.    'Yes!' said Pansa, 'she is exceedingly in repute just at this moment;  her statue has been uttering the most remarkable oracles.  I am not  superstitious, but I must confess that she has more than once assisted  me materially in my magistracy with her advice.  Her priests are so  pious, too! none of your gay, none of your proud, ministers of Jupiter  and Fortune: they walk barefoot, eat no meat, and pass the greater part  of the night in solitary devotion!'    'An example to our other priesthoods, indeed!--Jupiter's temple wants  reforming sadly,' said Lepidus, who was a great reformer for all but  himself.    'They say that Arbaces the Egyptian has imparted some most solemn  mysteries to the priests of Isis,' observed Sallust.  'He boasts his  descent from the race of Rameses, and declares that in his family the  secrets of remotest antiquity are treasured.'    'He certainly possesses the gift of the evil eye,' said Clodius. 'If I  ever come upon that Medusa front without the previous charm, I am sure  to lose a favorite horse, or throw the canes nine times running.'    'The last would be indeed a miracle!' said Sallust, gravely.    'How mean you, Sallust?' returned the gamester, with a flushed brow.    'I mean, what you would leave me if I played often with you; and that  is--nothing.'    Clodius answered only by a smile of disdain.    'If Arbaces were not so rich,' said Pansa, with a stately air, 'I should  stretch my authority a little, and inquire into the truth of the report  which calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer.  Agrippa, when aedile of  Rome, banished all such terrible citizens.  But a rich man--it is the  duty of an aedile to protect the rich!'    'What think you of this new sect, which I am told has even a few  proselytes in Pompeii, these followers of the Hebrew God--Christus?'    'Oh, mere speculative visionaries,' said Clodius; 'they have not a  single gentleman amongst them; their proselytes are poor, insignificant,  ignorant people!'    'Who ought, however, to be crucified for their blasphemy,' said Pansa,  with vehemence; 'they deny Venus and Jove!  Nazarene is but another name  for atheist.  Let me catch them--that's all.'    The second course was gone--the feasters fell back on their  couches--there was a pause while they listened to the soft voices of the  South, and the music of the Arcadian reed.  Glaucus was the most rapt  and the least inclined to break the silence, but Clodius began already  to think that they wasted time.    'Bene vobis! (Your health!) my Glaucus,' said he, quaffing a cup to each  letter of the Greek's name, with the ease of the practised drinker.  'Will you not be avenged on your ill-fortune of yesterday? See, the dice  court us.'    'As you will,' said Glaucus.    'The dice in summer, and I an aedile!' said Pansa, magisterially; 'it is  against all law.'    'Not in your presence, grave Pansa,' returned Clodius, rattling the dice  in a long box; 'your presence restrains all license: it is not the  thing, but the excess of the thing, that hurts.'    'What wisdom!' muttered the umbra.    'Well, I will look another way,' said the aedile.    'Not yet, good Pansa; let us wait till we have supped,' said Glaucus.    Clodius reluctantly yielded, concealing his vexation with a yawn.    'He gapes to devour the gold,' whispered Lepidus to Sallust, in a  quotation from the Aulularia of Plautus.    'Ah! how well I know these polypi, who hold all they touch,' answered  Sallust, in the same tone, and out of the same play.    The third course, consisting of a variety of fruits, pistachio nuts,  sweetmeats, tarts, and confectionery tortured into a thousand fantastic  and airy shapes, was now placed upon the table; and the ministri, or  attendants, also set there the wine (which had hitherto been handed  round to the guests) in large jugs of glass, each bearing upon it the  schedule of its age and quality.    'Taste this Lesbian, my Pansa,' said Sallust; 'it is excellent.'    'It is not very old,' said Glaucus, 'but it has been made precocious,  like ourselves, by being put to the fire:--the wine to the flames of  Vulcan--we to those of his wife--to whose honour I pour this cup.'    'It is delicate,' said Pansa, 'but there is perhaps the least particle  too much of rosin in its flavor.'    'What a beautiful cup!' cried Clodius, taking up one of transparent  crystal, the handles of which were wrought with gems, and twisted in the  shape of serpents, the favorite fashion at Pompeii.    'This ring,' said Glaucus, taking a costly jewel from the first joint of  his finger and hanging it on the handle, 'gives it a richer show, and  renders it less unworthy of thy acceptance, my Clodius, on whom may the  gods bestow health and fortune, long and oft to crown it to the brim!'    'You are too generous, Glaucus,' said the gamester, handing the cup to  his slave; 'but your love gives it a double value.'    'This cup to the Graces!' said Pansa, and he thrice emptied his calix.  The guests followed his example.    'We have appointed no director to the feast,' cried Sallust.    'Let us throw for him, then,' said Clodius, rattling the dice-box.    'Nay,' cried Glaucus, 'no cold and trite director for us: no dictator of  the banquet; no rex convivii.  Have not the Romans sworn never to obey a  king? Shall we be less free than your ancestors?  Ho! musicians, let us  have the song I composed the other night: it has a verse on this  subject, \"The Bacchic hymn of the Hours\".'    The musicians struck their instruments to a wild Ionic air, while the  youngest voice in the band chanted forth, in Greek words, as numbers,  the following strain:--               THE EVENING HYMN OF THE HOURS                         I         Through the summer day, through the weary day,            We have glided long;        Ere we speed to the Night through her portals grey,            Hail us with song!--           With song, with song,          With a bright and joyous song;         Such as the Cretan maid,          While the twilight made her bolder,         Woke, high through the ivy shade,          When the wine-god first consoled her.         From the hush'd, low-breathing skies,         Half-shut look'd their starry eyes,            And all around,            With a loving sound,          The AEgean waves were creeping:         On her lap lay the lynx's head;         Wild thyme was her bridal bed;         And aye through each tiny space,         In the green vine's green embrace         The Fauns were slily peeping--         The Fauns, the prying Fauns--        The arch, the laughing Fauns--        The Fauns were slily peeping!                         II          Flagging and faint are we          With our ceaseless flight,         And dull shall our journey be          Through the realm of night,         Bathe us, O bathe our weary wings         In the purple wave, as it freshly springs          To your cups from the fount of light--      From the fount of light--from the fount of light,         For there, when the sun has gone down in night,           There in the bowl we find him.         The grape is the well of that summer sun,         Or rather the stream that he gazed upon,         Till he left in truth, like the Thespian youth,             His soul, as he gazed, behind him.                        III          A cup to Jove, and a cup to Love,          And a cup to the son of Maia;         And honour with three, the band zone-free,          The band of the bright Aglaia.         But since every bud in the wreath of pleasure          Ye owe to the sister Hours,         No stinted cups, in a formal measure,          The Bromian law makes ours.         He honors us most who gives us most,         And boasts, with a Bacchanal's honest boast,          He never will count the treasure.       Fastly we fleet, then seize our wings,       And plunge us deep in the sparkling springs;       And aye, as we rise with a dripping plume,       We'll scatter the spray round the garland's bloom;             We glow--we glow,       Behold, as the girls of the Eastern wave       Bore once with a shout to the crystal cave         The prize of the Mysian Hylas,             Even so--even so,       We have caught the young god in our warm embrace       We hurry him on in our laughing race;       We hurry him on, with a whoop and song,       The cloudy rivers of night along--        Ho, ho!--we have caught thee, Psilas!    The guests applauded loudly.  When the poet is your host, his verses are  sure to charm.    'Thoroughly Greek,' said Lepidus: 'the wildness, force, and energy of  that tongue, it is impossible to imitate in the Roman poetry.'    'It is, indeed, a great contrast,' said Clodius, ironically at heart,  though not in appearance, 'to the old-fashioned and tame simplicity of  that ode of Horace which we heard before.  The air is beautifully Ionic:  the word puts me in mind of a toast--Companions, I give you the  beautiful Ione.'    'Ione!--the name is Greek,' said Glaucus, in a soft voice.

One day while he was in his gold room counting his money, a beautiful  fairy boy stood before him.    The boy's face shone with a wonderful light, and he had wings on his cap  and wings on his feet. In his hand he carried a strange-looking wand,  and the wand also had wings.    \"Midas, you are the richest man in the world,\" said the fairy. \"There is  no king who has so much gold as you.\"    \"That may be,\" said the king. \"As you see, I have this room full of  gold, but I should like much more; for gold is the best and the most  wonderful thing in the world.\"    \"Are you sure?\" asked the fairy.    \"I am very sure,\" answered the king.    \"If I should grant you one wish,\" said the fairy, \"would you ask for  more gold?\"    \"If I could have but one wish,\" said the king, \"I would ask that  everything I touched should turn to beautiful yellow gold.\"    \"Your wish shall be granted,\" said the fairy \"At sunrise to-morrow  morning your slightest touch will turn everything into gold. But warn  you that your gift will not make you happy.\"    \"I will take the risk,\" said the king.      THE GOLDEN TOUCH--II    The next morning King Midas awoke very early. He was eager to see if the  fairy's promise had come true.    As soon as the sun arose he tried the gift by touching the bed lightly  with his hand.    The bed turned to gold.    [Illustration]    He touched the chair and table.    Upon the instant they were turned to solid gold.    The king was wild with joy.    He ran around the room, touching everything he could see. His magic gift  turned all to shining, yellow gold.    The king soon felt hungry and went down to eat his breakfast. Now a  strange thing happened. When he raised a glass of clear cold water to  drink, it became solid gold.    Not a drop of water could pass his lips.    The bread turned to gold under his fingers.    The meat was hard, and yellow, and shiny.    Not a thing could he get to eat.    All was gold, gold, gold.    His little daughter came running in from the garden.    Of all living creatures she was the dearest to him.    He touched her hair with his lips.    At once the little girl was changed to a golden statue.    A great fear crept into the king's heart, sweeping all the joy out of  his life.    In his grief he called and called upon the fairy who had given him the  gift of the golden touch.    \"O fairy,\" he begged, \"take away this horrible golden gift! Take all my  lands. Take all my gold. Take everything, only give me back my little  daughter.\"    [Illustration]    In a moment the beautiful fairy was standing before him.    \"Do you still think that gold is the greatest thing in the world?\" asked  the fairy.    \"No! no!\" cried the king. \"I hate the very sight of the yellow stuff.\"    \"Are you sure that you no longer wish the golden touch?\" asked the  fairy.    \"I have learned my lesson,\" said the king. \"I no longer think gold the  greatest thing in the world.\"    \"Very well,\" said the fairy, \"take this pitcher to the spring in the  garden and fill it with water. Then sprinkle those things which you have  touched and turned to gold.\"    The king took the pitcher and rushed to the spring. Running back, he  first sprinkled the head of his dear little girl. Instantly she became  his own darling Marigold again, and gave him a kiss.    The king sprinkled the golden food, and to his great joy it turned back  to real bread and real butter.    Then he and his little daughter sat down to breakfast. How good the cold  water tasted. How eagerly the hungry king ate the bread and butter, the  meat, and all the good food.    The king hated his golden touch so much that he sprinkled even the  chairs and the tables and everything else that the fairy's gift had  turned to gold.    _Greek Myth_          [Illustration]        OVER IN THE MEADOW        Over in the meadow,        In the sand, in the sun,      Lived an old mother toad        And her little toadie one.      \"Wink!\" said the mother;        \"I wink,\" said the one;      So she winked and she blinked        In the sand, in the sun.        Over in the meadow,        Where the stream runs blue,      Lived an old mother fish        And her little fishes two.      \"Swim!\" said the mother;        \"We swim,\" said the two;      So they swam and they leaped        Where the stream runs blue.    [Illustration]        Over in the meadow,        In a hole in a tree,      Lived a mother bluebird        And her little birdies three.      \"Sing!\" said the mother;        \"We sing,\" said the three;      So they sang and were glad        In the hole in the tree.    [Illustration]        Over in the meadow,        In a snug beehive,      Lived a mother honeybee        And her little honeys five.      \"Buzz!\" said the mother;        \"We buzz,\" said the five;      So they buzzed and they hummed        In the snug beehive.    [Illustration]        Over in the meadow,        Where the clear pools shine,      Lived a green mother frog,        And her little froggies nine.      \"Croak!\" said the mother;        \"We croak,\" said the nine;      So they croaked and they splashed        Where the clear pools shine.    [Illustration]        Over in the meadow,        In a sly little den,      Lived a gray mother spider        And her little spiders ten.      \"Spin!\" said the mother;        \"We spin,\" said the ten;      So they spun lace webs        In their sly little den.        OLIVE A. WADSWORTH          [Illustration]    THE BELL OF ATRI    miser  justice  whose      Once upon a time a good and wise king ruled in the city of Atri.    He wished all his people to be happy.    In order that justice might be done to every one, he ordered a great  bell to be hung in a tower.    Tied to the bell was a strong rope, so long that it reached nearly to  the ground.    \"I have placed the bell in the center of my city,\" said the king, \"so  that it will be near all the people. The rope I have made long, so that  even a little child can reach it.\"    Then the king gave out this order:    \"If there be any one among my people who feels that he has not been  justly treated, let him ring this bell.    Then, whether he be old or young, rich or poor, his story shall be  heard.\"    The bell of justice had hung in its place for many years.    Many times it had been rung by the poor and needy, and justice had been  done.    At length the old rope became worn with use and age.    When it was taken down, another rope, long enough and strong enough,  could not be found. So the king had to send away for one.    \"What if some one should need help while the rope is down?\" cried the  people. \"We must find something to take its place.\"    So one of the men cut a long grapevine and fastened it to the great  bell.    It was in the springtime, and green shoots and leaves hung from the  grapevine rope.    Near Atri, there lived a rich old soldier.    This soldier owned a horse that had been with him through many battles.    The horse had grown old and lame, and was no longer able to work.    So his cruel master turned him out into the streets to get his living as  best he could.    \"If you cannot find enough to eat, then you may die,\" said the miser;  \"you are of no use to me.\"    The old horse went limping along; he grew thinner and thinner.    At length he limped up to the tower where the bell of justice hung.    His dim eyes saw the green shoots and the fresh leaves of the  grapevine.    Thinking they were good to eat, he gave a pull at the vine.    \"Ding-dong! ding-dong!\" said the great bell. The people came running  from all sides.    \"Who is calling for justice?\" they cried.    There stood the old horse, chewing on the grapevine.    \"Ding-dong! ding-dong!\" rang the great bell.    \"Whose horse is this?\" asked the judges, as they came running up.    Then the story of the old horse was told.    The judges sent for his cruel master.    They ordered that he should build a warm barn, and that the faithful  horse should have the best of hay and grain as long as he lived.    The people shouted for joy at this act of justice, but the miser hung  his head in shame and led the old horse away.    _German Folk Tale_              THE BABY        No shoes to hide her tiny toes,        No stockings on her feet;      Her little ankles white as snow,        Or early blossoms sweet.        Her simple dress of sprinkled pink;        Her tiny, dimpled chin;      Her rosebud lips and bonny mouth        With not one tooth between.        Her eyes so like her mother's own,        Two gentle, liquid things;      Her face is like an angel's face--        We're glad she has no wings.          HUGH MILLER    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    BRUCE AND THE SPIDER    Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, was hiding in a hut in the forest. His  enemies were seeking him far and wide.    Six times he had met them in battle, and six times he had failed. Hope  and courage were gone.    Bruce had given up all as lost. He was about to run away from Scotland,  and to leave the country in the hands of his enemies.    Full of sorrow, he lay stretched on a pile of straw in the poor  woodchopper's hut. While he lay thinking, he noticed a spider spinning  her web.    The spider was trying to spin a thread from one beam of the cottage to  another. It was a long way between the beams, and Bruce saw how hard a  thing it was for her to do.    \"She can never do it,\" thought the king.    The little spider tried it once and failed She tried it twice and  failed. The king counted each time. At length she had tried it six times  and had failed each time.    \"She is like me,\" thought the king. \"I have tried six battles and  failed. She has tried six times to reach the beam and failed.\"    Then starting up from the straw, he cried, \"I will hang my fate upon  that little spider.    If she swings the seventh time and fails, then I will give up all for  lost. If she swings the"]]]
