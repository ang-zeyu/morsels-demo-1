They are of a horny texture, not unlike dry parchment, and do not  readily decay.    I could gather some wonderful information regarding the Cigale were I to  listen to all that my neighbours, the peasants, tell me. I will give one  instance of rustic natural history.    [Illustration: THE CIGALE AND THE EMPTY PUPA-SKIN.]    Are you afflicted with any kidney trouble, or are you swollen with  dropsy, or have you need of some powerful diuretic? The village  pharmacopoeia is unanimous in recommending the Cigale as a sovereign  remedy. The insects in the adult form are collected in summer. They are  strung into necklaces which are dried in the sun and carefully preserved  in some cupboard or drawer. A good housewife would consider it imprudent  to allow July to pass without threading a few of these insects.    Do you suffer from any nephritic irritation or from stricture? Drink an  infusion of Cigales. Nothing, they say, is more effectual. I must take  this opportunity of thanking the good soul who once upon a time, so I  was afterwards informed, made me drink such a concoction unawares for  the cure of some such trouble; but I still remain incredulous. I have  been greatly struck by the fact that the ancient physician of Anazarbus  used to recommend the same remedy. Dioscorides tells us: _Cicadae, quae  inassatae manduntur, vesicae doloribus prosunt_. Since the distant days  of this patriarch of _materia medica_ the Provencal peasant has retained  his faith in the remedy revealed to him by the Greeks, who came from  Phocaea with the olive, the fig, and the vine. Only one thing is changed:  Dioscorides advises us to eat the Cigales roasted, but now they are  boiled, and the decoction is administered as medicine. The explanation  which is given of the diuretic properties of the insect is a marvel of  ingenuousness. The Cigale, as every one knows who has tried to catch it,  throws a jet of liquid excrement in one's face as it flies away. It  therefore endows us with its faculties of evacuation. Thus Dioscorides  and his contemporaries must have reasoned; so reasons the peasant of  Provence to-day.    What would you say, worthy neighbours, if you knew of the virtues of the  larva, which is able to mix sufficient mortar with its urine to build a  meteorological station and a shaft connecting with the outer world? Your  powers should equal those of Rabelais' Gargantua, who, seated upon the  towers of Notre Dame, drowned so many thousands of the inquisitive  Parisians.          CHAPTER III    THE SONG OF THE CIGALE      Where I live I can capture five species of Cigale, the two principal  species being the common Cigale and the variety which lives on the  flowering ash. Both of these are widely distributed and are the only  species known to the country folk. The larger of the two is the common  Cigale. Let me briefly describe the mechanism with which it produces its  familiar note.    On the under side of the body of the male, immediately behind the  posterior limbs, are two wide semicircular plates which slightly overlap  one another, the right hand lying over the left hand plate. These are  the shutters, the lids, the dampers of the musical-box. Let us remove  them. To the right and left lie two spacious cavities which are known in  Provencal as the chapels (_li capello_). Together they form the church  (_la gleiso_). Their forward limit is formed by a creamy yellow  membrane, soft and thin; the hinder limit by a dry membrane coloured  like a soap bubble and known in Provencal as the mirror (_mirau_).    The church, the mirrors, and the dampers are commonly regarded as the  organs which produce the cry of the Cigale. Of a singer out of breath  one says that he has broken his mirrors (_a li mirau creba_). The same  phrase is used of a poet without inspiration. Acoustics give the lie to  the popular belief. You may break the mirrors, remove the covers with a  snip of the scissors, and tear the yellow anterior membrane, but these  mutilations do not silence the song of the Cigale; they merely change  its quality and weaken it. The chapels are resonators; they do not  produce the sound, but merely reinforce it by the vibration of their  anterior and posterior membranes; while the sound is modified by the  dampers as they are opened more or less widely.    The actual source of the sound is elsewhere, and is somewhat difficult  for a novice to find. On the outer wall of either chapel, at the ridge  formed by the junction of back and belly, is a tiny aperture with a  horny circumference masked by the overlapping damper. We will call this  the window. This opening gives access to a cavity or sound-chamber,  deeper than the \"chapels,\" but of much smaller capacity. Immediately  behind the attachment of the posterior wings is a slight protuberance,  almost egg-shaped, which is distinguishable, on account of its dull  black colour, from the neighbouring integuments, which are covered with  a silvery down. This protuberance is the outer wall of the  sound-chamber.    Let us cut it boldly away. We shall then lay bare the mechanism which  produces the sound, the _cymbal_. This is a small dry, white membrane,  oval in shape, convex on the outer side, and crossed along its larger  diameter by a bundle of three or four brown nervures, which give it  elasticity. Its entire circumference is rigidly fixed. Let us suppose  that this convex scale is pulled out of shape from the interior, so  that it is slightly flattened and as quickly released; it will  immediately regain its original convexity owing to the elasticity of the  nervures. From this oscillation a ticking sound will result.    Twenty years ago all Paris was buying a silly toy, called, I think, the  cricket or _cri-cri_. It was a short slip of steel fixed by one end to a  metallic base. Pressed out of shape by the thumb and released, it  yielded a very distressing, tinkling _click_. Nothing else was needed to  take the popular mind by storm. The \"cricket\" had its day of glory.  Oblivion has executed justice upon it so effectually that I fear I shall  not be understood when I recall this celebrated device.    The membranous cymbal and the steel cricket are analogous instruments.  Both produce a sound by reason of the rapid deformation and recovery of  an elastic substance--in one case a convex membrane; in the other a slip  of steel. The \"cricket\" was bent out of shape by the thumb. How is the  convexity of the cymbals altered? Let us return to the \"church\" and  break down the yellow curtain which closes the front of each chapel. Two  thick muscular pillars are visible, of a pale orange colour; they join  at an angle, forming a ~V~, of which the point lies on the median line  of the insect, against the lower face of the thorax. Each of these  pillars of flesh terminates suddenly at its upper extremity, as though  cut short, and from the truncated portion rises a short, slender tendon,  which is attached laterally to the corresponding cymbal.    There is the whole mechanism, no less simple than that of the steel  \"cricket.\" The two muscular columns contract and relax, shorten and  lengthen. By means of its terminal thread each sounds its cymbal, by  depressing it and immediately releasing it, when its own elasticity  makes it spring back into shape. These two vibrating scales are the  source of the Cigale's cry.    Do you wish to convince yourself of the efficiency of this mechanism?  Take a Cigale but newly dead and make it sing. Nothing is simpler. Seize  one of these muscular columns with the forceps and pull it in a series  of careful jerks. The extinct _cri-cri_ comes to life again; at each  jerk there is a clash of the cymbal. The sound is feeble, to be sure,  deprived of the amplitude which the living performer is able to give it  by means of his resonating chambers; none the less, the fundamental  element of the song is produced by this anatomist's trick.    Would you, on the other hand, silence a living Cigale?--that obstinate  melomaniac, who, seized in the fingers, deplores his misfortune as  loquaciously as ever he sang the joys of freedom in his tree? It is  useless to violate his chapels, to break his mirrors; the atrocious  mutilation would not quiet him. But introduce a needle by the lateral  aperture which we have named the \"window\" and prick the cymbal at the  bottom of the sound-box. A little touch and the perforated cymbal is  silent. A similar operation on the other side of the insect and the  insect is dumb, though otherwise as vigorous as before and without any  perceptible wound. Any one not in the secret would be amazed at the  result of my pin-prick, when the destruction of the mirrors and the  other dependencies of the \"church\" do not cause silence. A tiny  perforation of no importance to the insect is more effectual than  evisceration.    The dampers, which are rigid and solidly built, are motionless. It is  the abdomen itself which, by rising and falling, opens or closes the  doors of the \"church.\" When the abdomen is lowered the dampers exactly  cover the chapels as well as the windows of the sound-boxes. The sound  is then muted, muffled, diminished. When the abdomen rises the chapels  are open, the windows unobstructed, and the sound acquires its full  volume. The rapid oscillations of the abdomen, synchronising with the  contractions of the motor muscles of the cymbals, determine the changing  volume of the sound, which seems to be caused by rapidly repeated  strokes of a fiddlestick.    If the weather is calm and hot, towards mid-day the song of the Cigale  is divided into strophes of several seconds' duration, which are  separated by brief intervals of silence. The strophe begins suddenly. In  a rapid crescendo, the abdomen oscillating with increasing rapidity, it  acquires its maximum volume; it remains for a few seconds at the same  degree of intensity, then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18362"],[0,"Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases (#6)"],[1,"facts    fragrant reminiscence    frail craft    frank admiration    frantic ardor    fraternal pity    freakish humor    freeborn soul    freezing disdain    frenzied haste    frequent digression    fresh impetus    freshening breeze    fretful discontent    friendly familiarity    frightened sense    frightful apparition    frigid disdain    frisky lightness    frivolous expedient    frolicsome extravagance    frozen wonder    fructifying thought       [fructifying = make fruitful or productive]    fruitful indignation    fruitless repining    fugitive thoughts    full plenitude    fulsome praise    fumbling endeavor    functional disparity    fundamental principles    funereal gloom    furious invective         [invective = abusive language]    furrowed cheeks    furtive glance    fussy enthusiasms    futile babble      G    gabbling reminiscences   [gabbling = speak rapidly or incoherently;
