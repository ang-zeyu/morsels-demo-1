[Illustration: MR. THOMAS SLOCDOLAGER, LATE MASTER OF THE LAVERICK WELLS  HOUNDS]    In some countries such a creature may be considered an acquisition, and so  long as he reigned at the Wells, people made the best they could of him,  though it was painfully apparent to the livery-stable keepers, and others,  who had the best interest of the place at heart, that such a red-faced,  gloveless, drab-breeched, mahogany-booted buffer, who would throw off at  the right time, and who resolutely set his great stubbly-cheeked face  against all show meets and social intercourse in the field, was not exactly  the man for a civilized place. Whether time might have enlightened Mr.  Slocdolager as to the fact, that continuous killing of foxes, after  fatiguingly long runs, was not the way to the hearts of the Laverick Wells  sportsmen, is unknown, for on attempting to realize as fine a subscription  as ever appeared upon paper, it melted so in the process of collection,  that what was realized was hardly worth his acceptance; saying so, in his  usual blunt way, that if he hunted a country at his own expense he would  hunt one that wasn't encumbered with fools, he just stamped his little  wardrobe into a pair of old black saddle-bags, and rode out of town without  saying 'tar, tar,' good-bye, carding, or P.P.C.-ing anybody.    This was at the end of a season, a circumstance that considerably mitigated  the inconvenience so abrupt a departure might have occasioned, and as one  of the great beauties of Laverick Wells is, that it is just as much in  vogue in summer as in winter, the inhabitants consoled themselves with the  old aphorism, that there is as 'good fish in the sea as ever came out of  it,' and cast about in search of some one to supply his place at as small  cost to themselves as possible. In a place so replete with money and the  enterprise of youth, little difficulty was anticipated, especially when the  old bait of 'a name' being all that was wanted, 'an ample subscription,' to  defray all expenses figuring in the background, was held out.          CHAPTER V    MR. WAFFLES      Among a host of most meritorious young men--(any of whom would get up  behind a bill for five hundred pounds without looking to see that it wasn't  a thousand)--among a host of most meritorious young men who made their  appearance at Laverick Wells towards the close of Mr. Slocdolager's reign,  was Mr. Waffles; a most enterprising youth, just on the verge of arriving  of age, and into the possession of a very considerable amount of charming  ready money.    Were it not that a 'proud aristocracy,' as Sir Robert Peel called them,  have shown that they can get over any little deficiency of birth if there  is sufficiency of cash, we should have thought it necessary to make the  best of Mr. Waffles' pedigree, but the tide of opinion evidently setting  the other way, we shall just give it as we had it, and let the proud  aristocracy reject him if they like. Mr. Waffles' father, then, was either  a great grazier or a great brazier--which, we are unable to say, 'for a  small drop of ink having fallen,' not 'like dew,' but like a black beetle,  on the first letter of the word in our correspondent's communication, it  may do for either--but in one of which trades he made a 'mint of money,'  and latish on in life married a lady who hitherto had filled the honourable  office of dairy-maid in his house; she was a fine handsome woman and a year  or two after the birth of this their only child, he departed this life,  nearer eighty than seventy, leaving an 'inconsolable,' &c., who  unfortunately contracted matrimony with a master pork-butcher, before she  got the fine flattering white monument up, causing young Waffles to be  claimed for dry-nursing by that expert matron the High Court of Chancery;  who, of course, had him properly educated--where, it is immaterial to  relate, as we shall step on till we find him at college.    Our friend, having proved rather too vivacious for the Oxford Dons, had  been recommended to try the effects of the Laverick Wells, or any other  waters he liked, and had arrived with a couple of hunters and a hack, much  to the satisfaction of the neighbouring master of hounds and his huntsman;  for Waffles had ridden over and maimed more hounds to his own share, during  the two seasons he had been at Oxford, than that gentleman had been in the  habit of appropriating to the use of the whole university. Corresponding  with that gentleman's delight at getting rid of him was Mr. Slocdolager's  dismay at his appearance, for fully satisfied that Oxford was the seat of  fox-hunting as well as of all the other arts and sciences, Mr. Waffles  undertook to enlighten him and his huntsman on the mysteries of their  calling, and 'Old Sloc,' as he was called, being a very silent man, while  Mr. Waffles was a very noisy one, Sloc was nearly talked deaf by him.    Mr. Waffles was just in the hey-day of hot, rash, youthful indiscretion and  extravagance. He had not the slightest idea of the value of money, and  looked at the fortune he was so closely approaching as perfectly  inexhaustible. His rooms, the most spacious and splendid at that most  spacious and splendid hotel, the 'Imperial,' were filled with a profusion  of the most useless but costly articles. Jewellery without end, pictures  innumerable, pictures that represented all sorts of imaginary sums of  money, just as they represented all sorts of imaginary scenes, but whose  real worth or genuineness would never be tested till the owner wanted to  'convert them.'    Mr. Waffles was a 'pretty man.' Tall, slim, and slight, with long curly  light hair, pink and white complexion, visionary whiskers, and a tendency  to moustache that could best be seen sideways. He had light blue eyes;  while his features generally were good, but expressive of little beyond  great good-humour. In dress, he was both smart and various; indeed, we feel  a difficulty in fixing him in any particular costume, so frequent and  opposite were his changes. He had coats of every cut and colour. Sometimes  he was the racing man with a bright-button'd Newmarket brown cut-away, and  white-cord trousers, with drab cloth-boots; anon, he would be the officer,  and shine forth in a fancy forage cap, cocked jauntily over a profusion of  well-waxed curls, a richly braided surtout, with military overalls strapped  down over highly varnished boots, whose hypocritical heels would sport a  pair of large rowelled long-necked, ringing, brass spurs. Sometimes he was  a Jack tar, with a little glazed hat, a once-round tie, a checked shirt, a  blue jacket, roomy trousers, and broad-stringed pumps; and, before the  admiring ladies had well digested him in that dress, he would be seen  cantering away on a long-tailed white barb, in a pea-green duck-hunter,  with cream-coloured leather and rose-tinted tops. He was        'All things by turns, and nothing long.'    Such was the gentleman elected to succeed the silent, matter-of-fact Mr.  Slocdolager in the important office of Master of the Laverick Wells Hunt;  and whatever may be the merits of either--upon which we pass no opinion--it  cannot be denied that they were essentially different. Mr. Slocdolager was  a man of few words, and not at all a ladies' man. He could not even talk  when he was crammed with wine, and though he could hold a good quantity,  people soon found out they might just as well pour it into a jug as down  his throat, so they gave up asking him out. He was a man of few coats, as  well as of few words; one on, and one off, being the extent of his  wardrobe. His scarlet was growing plum-colour, and the rest of his hunting  costume has been already glanced at. He lodged above Smallbones, the  veterinary surgeon, in a little back street, where he lived in the quietest  way, dining when he came in from hunting,--dressing, or rather changing,  only when he was wet, hunting each fox again over his brandy-and-water, and  bundling off to bed long before many of his 'field' had left the  dining-room. He was little better than a better sort of huntsman.    Waffles, as we said before, had made himself conspicuous towards the close  of Mr. Slocdolager's reign, chiefly by his dashing costume, his reckless  riding, and his off-hand way of blowing up and slanging people.    Indeed, a stranger would have taken him for the master, a delusion that was  heightened by his riding with a formidable-looking sherry-case, in the  shape of a horn, at his saddle. Save when engaged in sucking this, his  tongue was never at fault. It was jabber, jabber, jabber; chatter, chatter,  chatter; prattle, prattle, prattle; occasionally about something, oftener  about nothing, but in cover or out, stiff country or open, trotting or  galloping, wet day or dry, good scenting day or bad, Waffles' clapper never  was at rest. Like all noisy chaps, too, he could not bear any one to make a  noise but himself. In furtherance of this, he called in the aid of his  Oxfordshire rhetoric. He would halloo _at_ people, designating them by some  peculiarity that he thought he could wriggle out of, if necessary, instead  of attacking them by name. Thus, if a man spoke, or placed himself where  Waffles thought he ought not to be (that is to say, anywhere but where  Waffles was himself), he would exclaim, 'Pray, sir, hold your tongue!--you,  sir!--no, sir, not you--the man that speaks as if he had a brush in his  throat!'--or, '_Do_ come away, sir!--you, sir!--the man in the  mushroom-looking hat!'--or, 'that gentleman in the parsimonious boots!'  looking at some one with very narrow tops.

Deeply  impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to  remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony  which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very  pernicious a commerce.\"    All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps  and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than  half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,  and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites  in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the  population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania  about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the  proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was  on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one  in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few  freedmen.    The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were  all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,  though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern  ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the  plantations to Europe. \"If the Northern states will consult their  interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will  increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers,\" said  John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the  Constitution of the United States. \"What enriches a part enriches the  whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,\"  responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.    =References=    E.

CHAPTER II    COLONIAL AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, AND COMMERCE    THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT      =The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be  acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a  deep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and  aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism  which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,  the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single  proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the  law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his  landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of  estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders  owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude  inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also  enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing  class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and  political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was  equally important in the development of America, where practically all  the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their  livelihood from the soil.    =Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad  extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to  introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords  and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost  every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,  was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though  owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No  man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:  \"Labor and share alike.\" All were supposed to work in the fields and  receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims  attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and  distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among  the workers.    In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the  lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular  meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: \"Everyone that gathereth  not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the  river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve.\" Even  this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until  each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered  the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where  the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar  to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate  fields in which every person could \"set corn for his own particular.\"  Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of  their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and  labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of  the land. \"By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not  carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome  practice.\"    =Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and  Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of  land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions  of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact  a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He  could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in  large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of  baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any  considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either  sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on  condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as  \"quit rent.\" In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as  L9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this  source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual  tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,  the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the  land, a sum amounting to L19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit  rent,--\"really a feudal payment from freeholders,\"--was thus a material  source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever  it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant  irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of  grievances which led to the American Revolution.    Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in  the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the  companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there  were sixty manors of three thousand acres each,"]]]
