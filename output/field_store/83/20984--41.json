Maximilian, king of the Romans, son of the emperor Frederick, had, by  his marriage with the heiress of Burgundy, acquired an interest in  the Netherlands; and though the death of his consort had weakened his  connections with that country, he still pretended to the government  as tutor to his son Philip, and his authority had been acknowledged  by Brabant, Holland, and several of the provinces. But as Flanders and  Hainault still refused to submit to his regency, and even appointed  other tutors to Philip, he had been engaged in long wars against that  obstinate people, and never was able thoroughly to subdue their spirit.  That he might free himself from the opposition of France, he had  concluded a peace with Lewis XI., and had given his daughter Margaret,  then an infant, in marriage to the dauphin; together with Artois,  Franche Compte, and Charolois, as her dowry. But this alliance had  not produced the desired effect. The dauphin succeeded to the crown of  France by the appellation of Charles VIII.; but Maximilian still found  the mutinies of the Flemings fomented by the intrigues of the court of  France.    France, during the two preceding reigns, had made a mighty increase in  power and greatness; and had not other states of Europe at the same time  received an accession of force, it had been impossible to have retained  her within her ancient boundaries. Most of the great fiefs, Normandy,  Champagne, Anjou, Dauphny, Guienne, Provence, and Burgundy, had  been united to the crown; the English had been expelled from all their  conquests; the authority of the prince had been raised to such a height  as enabled him to maintain law and order; a considerable military force  was kept on foot, and the finances were able to support it. Lewis XI,  indeed, from whom many of these advantages were derived, was dead, and  had left his son, in early youth and ill educated, to sustain the weight  of the monarchy: but having intrusted the government to his daughter  Anne, lady of Beaujeu, a woman of spirit and capacity, the French power  suffered no check or decline. On the contrary, this princess formed the  great project, which at last she happily effected, of uniting to the  crown Brittany, the last and most independent fief of the monarchy.    Francis II., duke of Brittany, conscious of his own incapacity for  government, had resigned himself to the direction of Peter Landais,  a man of mean birth, more remarkable for abilities than for virtue or  integrity. The nobles of Brittany, displeased with the great advancement  of this favorite, had even proceeded to disaffection against their  sovereign; and after many tumults and disorders, they at last united  among themselves, and in a violent manner seized, tried, and put to  death the obnoxious minister. Dreading the resentment of the prince for  this invasion of his authority, many of them retired to France; others,  for protection and safety, maintained a secret correspondence with the  French ministry, who, observing the great dissensions among the Bretons,  thought the opportunity favorable for invading the duchy; and so  much the rather as they could cover their ambition under the specious  pretence of providing for domestic security.    Lewis, duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, and presumptive  heir of the monarchy, had disputed the administration with the lady of  Beaujeu; and though his pretensions had been rejected by the states, he  still maintained cabals with many of the grandees, and laid schemes  for subverting the authority of that princess. Finding his conspiracies  detected, he took to arms, and fortified himself in Beaugeune;  but as his revolt was precipitate, before his confederates were ready to  join him, he had been obliged to submit, and to receive such conditions  as the French ministry were pleased to impose upon him. Actuated,  however, by his ambition, and even by his fears, he soon retired out of  France, and took shelter with the duke of Brittany, who was desirous of  strengthening himself against the designs of the lady of Beaujeu by the  friendship and credit of the duke of Orleans. This latter prince  also, perceiving the ascendant which he soon acquired over the duke of  Brittany, had engaged many of his partisans to join him at that court,  and had formed the design of aggrandizing himself by a marriage with  Anne, the heir of that opulent duchy.    The barons of Brittany, who saw all favor engrossed by the duke of  Orleans and his train, renewed a stricter correspondence with France,  and even invited the French king to make an invasion on their country.  Desirous, however, of preserving its independency, they had regulated  the number of succors which France was to send them, and had stipulated  that no fortified place in Brittany should remain in the possession of  that monarchy; a vain precaution, where revolted subjects treat with a  power so much superior! The French invaded Brittany with forces three  times more numerous than those which they had promised to the barons;  and advancing into the heart of the country, laid siege to Ploerrnel. To  oppose them, the duke raised a numerous but ill-disciplined army, which  he put under the command of the duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois,  and others of the French nobility. The army, discontented with this  choice, and jealous of their confederates, soon disbanded, and left  their prince with too small a force to keep the field against his  invaders. He retired to Vannes; but being hotly pursued by the French,  who had now made themselves masters of Ploermel, he escaped to Nantz;  and the enemy, having previously taken and garrisoned Vannes, Dinant,  and other places, laid close siege to that city. The barons of Brittany,  finding their country menaced with total subjection, began gradually to  withdraw from the French army, and to make peace with their sovereign.    This desertion, however, of the Bretons discouraged not the court  of France from pursuing her favorite project of reducing Brittany to  subjection The situation of Europe appeared favorable to the execution  of this design. Maximilian was indeed engaged in close alliance with the  duke of Brittany and had even opened a treaty for marrying his daughter;  but he was on all occasions so indigent, and at that time so disquieted  by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little effectual assistance could  be expected from him. Ferdinand was entirely occupied in the conquest of  Granada; and it was also known, that if France would resign to him  Roussillon and Cerdagne, to which he had pretensions, she could at any  time engage him to abandon the interests of Brittany. England, alone,  was both enabled by her power, and engaged by her interests, to support  the independency of that duchy; and the most dangerous opposition was  therefore, by Anne of Beaujeu, expected from that quarter. In order to  cover her real designs, no sooner was she informed of Henry's success  against Simnel and his partisans, than she despatched ambassadors to the  court of London, and made professions of the greatest trust and  confidence in that monarch.    The ambassadors, after congratulating Henry on his late victory, and  communicating to him, in the most cordial manner, as to an intimate  friend, some successes of their master against Maximilian, came in  the progress of their discourse to mention the late transactions in  Brittany. They told him that the duke having given protection to French  fugitives and rebels, the king had been necessitated, contrary to his  intention and inclination, to carry war into that duchy; that the honor  of the crown was interested not to suffer a vassal so far to forget  his duty to his liege lord; nor was the security of the government less  concerned to prevent the consequences of this dangerous temerity: that  the fugitives were no mean or obscure persons; but among others,  the duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, who, finding himself  obnoxious to justice for treasonable practices in France, had fled  into Brittany; where he still persevered in laying schemes of rebellion  against his sovereign: that the war being thus, on the part of the  French monarch, entirely defensive, it would immediately cease, when the  duke of Brittany, by returning to his duty, should remove the causes of  it: that their master was sensible of the obligations which the duke,  in very critical times, had conferred on Henry; but it was known also,  that, in times still more critical, he or his mercenary counsellors  had deserted him, and put his life in the utmost hazard: that his sole  refuge in these desperate extremities had been the court of France,  which not only protected his person, but supplied him with men and  money, with which, aided by his own valor and conduct, he had been  enabled to mount the throne of England; that France in this transaction  had, from friendship to Henry acted contrary to what, in a narrow view,  might be esteemed her own interest; since, instead of an odious tyrant,  she had contributed to establish on a rival throne a prince endowed with  such virtue and abilities; and that, as both the justice of the cause  and the obligations conferred on Henry thus preponderated on the side  of France, she reasonably expected that, if the situation of his affairs  did not permit him to give her assistance, he would at least preserve a  neutrality between the contending parties.[*]         * Bacon, p. 589.    This discourse of the French ambassadors was plausible; and to give  it greater weight, they communicated to Henry, as in confidence, their  master's intention, after he should have settled the differences with  Brittany to lead an army into Italy, and make good his pretensions to  the kingdom of Naples; a project which, they knew, would give no umbrage  to the court of England. But all these artifices were in vain employed  against the penetration"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#6)"],[1,"in pieces, tore the  pictures, overthrew the altars, scattered about the sacred vases; and  left no implement of idolatrous worship, as they termed it, entire or  undefaced. They thence proceeded, with additional numbers and augmented  rage, to the monasteries of the Gray and Black friars, which they  pillaged in an instant: the Carthusians underwent the same fate: and the  populace, not content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented  their fury on the buildings which had been the receptacles of such  abomination; and in a little time nothing but the walls of these  edifices were left standing. The inhabitants of Coupar, in Fife, soon  after imitated the example.[***]         * Melvil's Memoirs, p. 24. Jebb. vol. ii. p. 446.         ** See note B, at the end of the volume.         *** Spotswood, p. 121. Knox, p. 127.    The queen regent, provoked at these violences, assembled an army, and  prepared to chastise the rebels. She had about two thousand French under  her command, with a few Scottish troops; and being assisted by such of  the nobility as were well affected to her, she pitched her camp within  ten miles of Perth. Even the earl of Argyle, and Lord James Stuart,  prior of St. Andrew's, the queen's natural brother, though deeply  engaged with the reformers, attended the regent in this enterprise,  either because they blamed the fury of the populace, or hoped by their  own influence and authority to mediate some agreement between the  parties. The congregation, on the other hand, made preparations for  defence; and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the west, and  being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry, they appeared  formidable from their numbers, as well as from the zeal by which they  were animated. They sent an address to the regent, where they plainly  insinuated, that if they were pursued to extremities by the \"cruel  beasts\" the churchmen, they would have recourse to foreign powers for  assistance; and they subscribed themselves her faithful subjects in all  things not repugnant to God, assuming, at the same time, the name of the  faithful congregation of Christ Jesus.[*] They applied to the nobility  attending her, and maintained, that their own past violences were  justified by the word of God, which commands the godly to destroy  idolatry, and all the monuments of it; and though all civil authority  was sacred, yet was there a great difference between the authority and  the persons who exercised it;[**] and that it ought to be considered,  whether or not those abominations, called by the pestilent Papists  religion, and which they defend by fire and sword, be the true religion  of Christ Jesus. They remonstrated with such of the queen's army as had  formerly embraced their party, and told them, \"that as they were already  reputed traitors by God, they should likewise be excommunicated from  their society, and from the participation of the sacraments of the  church which God by his mighty power had erected among them; whose  ministers have the same authority which Christ granted to his apostles  in these words, 'Whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven, and  whose sins ye shall retain shall be retained.'\"[***]         * Knox, p. 129.         ** Knox, p. 131.         *** Knox, p. 133.    We may here see, that these new saints were no less lofty in their  pretensions than the ancient hierarchy: no wonder they were enraged  against the latter as their rivals in dominion. They joined to all these  declarations an address to the established church; and they affixed this  title to it: \"To the generation of Antichrist, the pestilent prelates  and their 'shavelings'[*] in Scotland, the congregation of Christ Jesus  within the same sayeth.\" The tenor of the manifesto was suitable to the  title. They told the ecclesiastics, \"As ye by tyranny intend not only to  destroy our bodies, but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage  of the devil, subject to idolatry, so shall we, with all the force  and power which God shall grant unto us, execute just vengeance and  punishment upon you: yea, we shall begin that same war which God  commanded Israel to execute against the Canaanites; that is, contract of  peace shall never be made till you desist from your open idolatry,  and cruel persecution of God's children. And this, in the name of the  eternal God, and of his Son Christ Jesus, whose verity we profess, and  gospel we have preached, and holy sacraments rightly administered,  we signify unto you to be our intent, so far as God will assist us  to withstand your idolatry. Take this for warning, and be not  deceived.\"[**] With these outrageous symptoms commenced in Scotland that  cant, hypocrisy, and fanaticism which long infested that kingdom, and  which, though now mollified by the lenity of the civil power, is still  ready to break out on all occasions.    The queen regent, finding such obstinate zeal in the rebels, was content  to embrace the counsels of Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's, and  to form an accommodation with them. She was received into Perth, which  submitted, on her promising an indemnity for past offences, and engaging  not to leave any French garrison in the place. Complaints, very  ill founded, immediately arose concerning the infraction of this  capitulation. Some of the inhabitants, it was pretended, were molested  on account of the late violences; and some companies of Scotch soldiers,  supposed to be in French pay, were quartered in the town; which step,  though taken on very plausible grounds, was loudly exclaimed against by  the congregation.[***]         * A contemptuous term for a priest.         * Keith, p. 85, 86, 87. Knox, p. 134.         * Knox, p. 139.    It is asserted that the regent, to justify these measures, declared,  that princes ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon  them; nor was any faith to be kept with heretics: and that for her part,  could she find as good a color, she would willingly bereave all these  men of their lives and fortunes.[*] But it is nowise likely that such  expressions ever dropped from this prudent and virtuous princess. On the  contrary, it appears that all these violences were disagreeable to her;  that she was in this particular overruled by the authority of the  French counsellors placed about her; and that she often thought, if the  management of those affairs had been intrusted wholly to herself, she  could easily, without force, have accommodated all differences.[**] [3]    The congregation, inflamed with their own zeal, and enraged by these  disappointments, remained not long in tranquillity. Even before they  left Perth, and while as yet they had no color to complain of any  violation of treaty, they had signed a new covenant, in which, besides  their engagements to mutual defence, they vowed, in the name of God, to  employ their whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his  holy name; and this covenant was subscribed, among others, by Argyle and  the prior of St. Andrew's.[***]         * Knox, p. 139. Spotswood, p. 123.         ** See note C, at the end of the volume.         *** Keith, p 89. Knox, p. 138.    These two leaders now desired no better pretence for deserting the  regent and openly joining their associates, than the complaints, however  doubtful, or rather false, of her breach of promise. The congregation  also, encouraged by this accession of force, gave themselves up entirely  to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at Crail, Anstruther, and other  places in Fife, like depredations on the churches and monasteries with  those formerly committed at Perth and Coupar. The regent, who marched  against them with her army, finding their power so much increased,  was glad to conclude a truce for a few days, and to pass over with her  forces to the Lothians. The reformers besieged and took Perth; proceeded  thence to Stirling, where they exercised their usual fury; and finding  nothing able to resist them, they bent their march to Edinburgh, the  inhabitants of which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the  congregation against the churches and monasteries, gladly opened their  gates to them. The regent, with the few forces which remained with her,  took shelter in Dunbar, where she fortified herself, in expectation of a  reenforcement from France.    Meanwhile, she employed her partisans in representing to the people the  dangerous consequences of this open rebellion; and she endeavored to  convince them, that the Lord James, under pretence of religion,  had formed the scheme of wresting the sceptre from the hands of the  sovereign. By these considerations many were engaged to desert the army  of the congregation; but much more by the want of pay, or any means  of subsistence; and the regent, observing the malecontents to be much  weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh, with a design of suppressing  them. On the interposition of the duke of Chatelrault, who still adhered  to her, she agreed to a capitulation, in which she granted them a  toleration of their religion, and they engaged to commit no further  depredations on the churches. Soon after, they evacuated the city; and  before they left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but they  took care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves, and they  were guilty of an imposture, in adding one to the number, namely, that  idolatry should not again be erected in any place where it was at that  time suppressed.[*] [4]    An agreement concluded while men were in this disposition, could not be  durable; and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as  possible against the ensuing rupture, which appeared inevitable. The  regent, having got a reenforcement of one thousand men from France,  began to fortify Leith; and the congregation seduced to their party the  duke of Chatelrault, who had long appeared inclined to join them, and  who was at last determined by the"]]]
