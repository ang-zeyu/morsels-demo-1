Immediately after  escaping from Egypt they set out across the desert for Mount Sinai,  which was considered the home of their God Jehovah, there to offer up  sacrifices of gratitude. Moreover, from that time on, every year they  brought to mind the story of the great deliverance through a  sacrificial feast called the Passover. Under Moses' leadership at  Sinai they entered into a covenant with Jehovah. They were to be  Jehovah's people forever, and they probably agreed to worship him  only, as their national God.    =Monotheism.=--At this time few had come to perceive the truth of  monotheism, namely, that there is but one God in the universe, and  that all the so-called gods and goddesses are mere superstitions. The  Hebrews, at this time, did not doubt the real existence of other gods  than Jehovah, such as Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Marduk and  Shamash, gods of Babylon. But after the deliverance from Egypt they  felt themselves bound to Jehovah by special ties of gratitude, and  more and more came to consider the worship of any other god, by a  Hebrew as base disloyalty. So the Exodus, and the experiences at  Sinai, pointed the way, at least, toward monotheism.    =Justice.=--Of great importance also was the influence of these  experiences on their ideas of right and wrong, and their conception of  the character of Jehovah. Because they as a nation had been enslaved  they were the better able to sympathize with the oppressed and  down-trodden. \"Remember,\" their prophets could always say, \"that _ye_  were slaves in the land of Egypt.\" And when, in after years, they were  unjust in their dealings with foreigners living among them, they were  reminded that \"Ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\"    These ideals were reflected in their conception of their God. Many of  their notions about him were crude and unworthy, even late in their  history. This was natural and inevitable in the light of the times in  which they lived. But in these Egyptian and desert experiences we see  a notable beginning of nobler religious ideals. From this time on they  were impelled to think of Jehovah, first of all as the God who had  brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and who had taken their  part, humble shepherds as they were, against the mighty Pharaoh, the  king of Egypt. To that extent, at least, their God was a God of  justice and mercy. Other ideas, which were inconsistent with this,  continued for a time, but gradually fell away, until at length great  seers arose who proclaimed that God is nothing else than justice and  mercy; righteousness is the essence of his character, and that is all  he asks of men.        \"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne.\"      THE TEN COMMANDMENTS    According to all the Hebrew records, the covenant at Sinai was  embodied in a divinely given Decalogue, or a set of ten short  commands, which could be counted off on the ten fingers. Two  Decalogues are given in Exodus, as coming from Moses at Sinai. One is  in Exodus 34. 17-28. The other is the well-known Decalogue in Exodus  20. The former has to do largely with sacrifices and ritual  observances. The latter, with its stern demands for right conduct  toward one's fellow men, and for the worship of Jehovah rather than  idols, expresses well the new moral and religious impulses which came  to the Hebrews under the leadership of their first great deliverer.    In its original form the Decalogue probably read something as follows:      =Thou shalt have no other gods before me.=    =Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven (or molten) image.=    =Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain.=    =Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.=    =Honor thy father and thy mother.=    =Thou shalt not kill.=    =Thou shalt not commit adultery.=    =Thou shalt not steal.=    =Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.=    =Thou shalt not covet.=      STUDY TOPICS    1.

CHAPTER VI    FROM THE DESERT INTO CANAAN      Once safely out of Egypt, the next problem for Moses and his people  was to find a way into Canaan. Through all the centuries the wandering  shepherds on the edge of the desert have looked with longing eyes on  the fertile valleys and plains of Palestine. To have a settled,  comfortable home, with cisterns of water as well as springs and wells;  to have fields of wheat, vineyards of grapes, and gardens of melons  and all luscious fruits--this is the picture that haunts the wandering  Arab, amid the hardships and monotony of his desert life.      THE LAND OF CANAAN    During the twelfth and eleventh centuries before Christ there was an  unusually good opportunity for nomads to settle in Palestine. Before  and after that time there were strong empires in control of the land  protecting it from invasion. The Greeks and Romans long afterward  built a line of fortified towns east of the Jordan on the border of  the desert, whose ruins may be seen to-day. In similar ways the  Babylonians and the Egyptians had occupied and defended the country.  But just about the time when the Hebrews escaped from Egypt, and for a  century and more afterward, both the Egyptian and Babylonian  governments were weak. And as the various petty kings of Canaan itself  were usually at war with each other, there was no strong government  anywhere whose soldiers newcomers would have to face.    =The first invasion from the south.=--Very soon after leaving the  mountain of Sinai the Hebrew tribes found themselves on the southern  edge of Canaan, in what was afterward known as the South Country,  south of Judah. Scouts were sent up as far as the town of Hebron,  which was afterward for a time the capital of Judah, to investigate  and report on conditions there. They returned with a glowing account  of the fertility of the soil. It is even stated in the Hebrew  traditions that they brought back as a sample of the crops, one bunch  of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two  men.    But with the exception of one of their leaders, a certain Caleb, all  the men reported that the cities were strongly fortified and the  inhabitants so warlike that an invasion was out of the question. The  people adopted this \"majority report\" in spite of the protests of  Moses. It is probable that the life in Egypt, with something of ease  and luxury for a time, and then so many years of slavery, had sapped  their courage and will power. At any rate, after a brief encounter  with some of the tribesmen nearby, they fled in panic into the desert  again.      THE WILDERNESS WANDERINGS    There followed, for a generation and more, a period of training  somewhat like that which Boy Scouts receive, or should receive, on  their \"hikes\" and camping trips. They learned to be independent and  resourceful. It was at times very difficult to find food for  themselves, or pasture for their sheep, and there was nothing to eat  but the \"manna,\" which they believed their God provided for them, and  which was perhaps in the nature of an edible moss or lichen. At times  there was a terrible scarcity of water. Always there was the danger of  losing their way on those trackless wastes, and in this matter also  they learned to look to their God as their pillar of cloud by day and  their pillar of fire by night, guiding them from oasis to oasis in  their search for food and pasturage. Then there were wild beasts and  poisonous serpents and, worst of all, hostile tribes with whom more  than once they had to fight for their lives.    =Gaining a foothold east of the Jordan.=--All these years of wandering  were spent mostly in the desert south of Canaan. Later they worked  their way around the lower end of the Dead Sea to the east toward what  was later known as the land of Gilead, on the eastern side of the  Jordan River.    This region is very fertile and was always noted in Bible times for  its fat cattle. But its rolling plains lie open and defenseless toward  the desert. Here under Moses' leadership the Hebrews were able to  conquer one or two of the petty local chieftains, and thus gained a  foothold from which they might some time make a sally across the River  Jordan into central Canaan itself.    =The death of Moses.=--In this eastern country Moses died. According  to the Hebrew story, Jehovah gave him a view of the land of Canaan  from one of the high mountains overlooking the Jordan River, after  which death came. And \"no man knoweth of his sepulcher to this day.\"  He had been loyal to the divine call which had come to him so long ago  in a flame which \"burned and did not consume,\" loyal to the mother who  had taught him amid the luxuries of an Egyptian palace not to forget  his own people and their sorrows. He had led his people out of Egypt  and its slavery in defiance of the proud and mighty Pharaoh. And he  had taught them to turn to Jehovah as God of justice and to worship  only him.      THE INVASION OF CANAAN FROM THE EAST    It was not long after the settlement east of the Jordan that the  Hebrews began to make raids across the river, in part under the  leadership of one of Moses' lieutenants, Joshua. The first town they  captured was Jericho, down in the hot valley of the Jordan River, a  few miles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#6)"],[1,"I have watched them carefully, I have  never seen them cross to each other's fishing grounds.    Once, up on the Big Toledi, I saw a curious bit of their education. I  was paddling across the lake one day, when I saw a shellbird lead her  brood into a little bay where I knew the water was shallow; and  immediately they began dipping, though very awkwardly. They were  evidently taking their first lessons in diving. The next afternoon I  was near the same place. I had done fishing--or rather, frogging--and  had pushed the canoe into some tall grass out of sight, and was  sitting there just doing nothing.    A musquash came by, and rubbed his nose against the canoe, and nibbled  a lily root before he noticed me. A shoal of minnows were playing  among the grasses near by. A dragon-fly stood on his head against a  reed--a most difficult feat, I should think. He was trying some  contortion that I couldn't make out, when a deer stepped down the  bank and never saw me. Doing nothing pays one under such  circumstances, if only by the glimpses it gives of animal life. It is  so rare to see a wild thing unconscious.    Then Kwaseekho came into the shallow bay again with her brood, and  immediately they began dipping as before. I wondered how the mother  made them dive, till I looked through the field-glass and saw that the  little fellows occasionally brought up something to eat. But there  certainly were no fish to be caught in that warm, shallow water. An  idea struck me, and I pushed the canoe out of the grass, sending the  brood across the lake in wild confusion. There on the black bottom  were a dozen young trout, all freshly caught, and all with the  air-bladder punctured by the mother bird's sharp bill. She had  provided their dinner, but she brought it to a good place and made  them dive to get it.    As I paddled back to camp, I thought of the way the Indians taught  their boys to shoot. They hung their dinner from the trees, out of  reach, and made them cut the cord that held it, with an arrow. Did the  Indians originate this, I wonder, in their direct way of looking at  things, almost as simple as the birds'? Or was the idea whispered to  some Indian hunter long ago, as he watched Merganser teach her young  to dive?    Of all the broods I have met in the wilderness, only one, I think,  ever grew to recognize me and my canoe a bit, so as to fear me less  than another. It was on a little lake in the heart of the woods, where  we lingered long on our journey, influenced partly by the beauty of  the place, and partly by the fact that two or three bears roamed about  there, which I sometimes met at twilight on the lake shore. The brood  were as wild as other broods; but I met them often, and they sometimes  found the canoe lying motionless and harmless near them, without quite  knowing how it came there. So after a few days they looked at me with  curiosity and uneasiness only, unless I came too near.    There were six in the brood. Five were hardy little fellows that made  the water boil behind them as they scurried across the lake. But the  sixth was a weakling. He had been hurt, by a hawk perhaps, or a big  trout, or a mink; or he had swallowed a bone; or maybe he was just a  weak little fellow with no accounting for it. Whenever the brood were  startled, he struggled bravely a little while to keep up; then he  always fell behind. The mother would come back, and urge, and help  him; but it was of little use. He was not strong enough; and the last  glimpse I always had of them was a foamy wake disappearing round a  distant point, while far in the rear was a ripple where the little  fellow still paddled away, doing his best pathetically.    [Illustration]    One afternoon the canoe glided round a point and ran almost up to the  brood before they saw it, giving them a terrible fright. Away they  went on the instant, _putter, putter, putter_, lifting themselves  almost out of water with the swift-moving feet and tiny wings. The  mother bird took wing, returned and crossed the bow of the canoe, back  and forth, with loud quackings. The weakling was behind as usual; and  in a sudden spirit of curiosity or perversity--for I really had a good  deal of sympathy for the little fellow--I shot the canoe forward,  almost up to him. He tried to dive; got tangled in a lily stem in his  fright; came up, flashed under again; and I saw him come up ten feet  away in some grass, where he sat motionless and almost invisible amid  the pads and yellow stems.    How frightened he was! Yet how still he sat! Whenever I took my eyes  from him a moment I had to hunt again, sometimes two or three minutes,  before I could see him there.    Meanwhile the brood went almost to the opposite shore before they  stopped, and the mother, satisfied at last by my quietness, flew over  and lit among them. She had not seen the little one. Through the glass  I saw her flutter round and round them, to be quite sure they were all  there. Then she missed him. I could see it all in her movements. She  must have clucked, I think, for the young suddenly disappeared, and  she came swimming rapidly back over the way they had come, looking,  looking everywhere. Round the canoe she went at a safe distance,  searching among the grass and lily pads, calling him softly to come  out. But he was very near the canoe, and very much frightened; the  only effect of her calls was to make him crouch closer against the  grass stems, while the bright little eyes, grown large with fear, were  fastened on me.    Slowly I backed the canoe away till it was out of sight around the  point, though I could still see the mother bird through the bushes.  She swam rapidly about where the canoe had been, calling more loudly;  but the little fellow had lost confidence in her, or was too  frightened, and refused to show himself. At last she discovered him,  and with quacks and flutters that looked to me a bit hysteric pulled  him out of his hiding place. How she fussed over him! How she hurried  and helped and praised and scolded him all the way over; and fluttered  on ahead, and clucked the brood out of their hiding places to meet  him! Then, with all her young about her, she swept round the point  into the quiet bay that was their training school.    And I, drifting slowly up the lake into the sunset over the glassy  water, was thinking how human it all was. \"Doth he not leave the  ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost,  until he find it?\"          III. QUEER WAYS OF BR'ER RABBIT.      [Illustration]    Br'er Rabbit is a funny fellow. No wonder that Uncle Remus makes him  the hero of so many adventures! Uncle Remus had watched him, no doubt,  on some moonlight night when he gathered his boon companions together  for a frolic. In the heart of the woods it was, in a little opening  where the moonlight came streaming in through the pines, making soft  gray shadows for hide-and-seek, and where no prowling fox ever dreamed  of looking.    With most of us, I fear, the acquaintance with Bunny is too limited  for us to appreciate his frolicsome ways and his happy, fun-loving  disposition. The tame things which we sometimes see about country  yards are often stupid, like a playful kitten spoiled by too much  handling; and the flying glimpse we sometimes get of a bundle of brown  fur, scurrying helter-skelter through and over the huckleberry bushes,  generally leaves us staring in astonishment at the swaying leaves  where it disappeared, and wondering curiously what it was all about.  It was only a brown rabbit that you almost stepped upon in your  autumn walk through the woods.    Look under the crimson sumach yonder, there in the bit of brown grass,  with the purple asters hanging over, and you will find his form, where  he has been sitting all the morning and where he watched you all the  way up the hill. But you need not follow; you will not find him again.  He never runs straight; the swaying leaves there where he disappeared  mark the beginning of his turn, whether to right or left you will  never know. Now he has come around his circle and is near you  again--watching you this minute, out of his bit of brown grass. As you  move slowly away in the direction he took, peering here and there  among the bushes, Bunny behind you sits up straight in his old form  again, with his little paws held very prim, his long ears pointed  after you, and his deep brown eyes shining like the waters of a hidden  spring among the asters. And he chuckles to himself, and thinks how he  fooled you that time, sure.    To see Br'er Rabbit at his best, that is, at his own playful comical  self, one must turn hunter, and learn how to sit still, and be  patient. Only you must not hunt in the usual way; not by day, for then  Bunny is stowed away in his form on the sunny slope of a southern  hillside, where one's eyes will never find him; not with gun and dog,  for then the keen interest and quick sympathy needed to appreciate any  phase of animal life gives place to the coarser excitement of the  hunt; and not by going about after Bunny, for your heavy footsteps and  the rustle of leaves will only send him scurrying away into safer  solitudes. Find where he loves to meet with his fellows, in quiet  little openings in the woods. There is no mistaking his playground  when once you have found it. Go there by moonlight and, sitting still  in the shadow, let your game find you, or pass by without suspicion;  for this is the best way to hunt, whether one is after game or only a  better knowledge of the ways of bird and beast.    The very best spot I ever found for watching Bunny's ways was on the  shore of a lonely lake in the heart of a New Brunswick forest. I  hardly think that he was any different there, for I have seen some of  his pranks repeated within sight of a busy New England town; but he  was certainly more natural. He had never seen a man before, and he was  as curious about it"]]]
