Reply Obj. 2: A man's good which, through fame or glory, is in the  knowledge of many, if this knowledge be true, must needs be derived  from good existing in the man himself: and hence it presupposes  perfect or inchoate happiness. But if the knowledge be false, it does  not harmonize with the thing: and thus good does not exist in him who  is looked upon as famous. Hence it follows that fame can nowise make  man happy.    Reply Obj. 3: Fame has no stability; in fact, it is easily ruined by  false report. And if sometimes it endures, this is by accident. But  happiness endures of itself, and for ever.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 4]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in Power?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness consists in power. For all  things desire to become like to God, as to their last end and first  beginning. But men who are in power, seem, on account of the  similarity of power, to be most like to God: hence also in Scripture  they are called \"gods\" (Ex. 22:28), \"Thou shalt not speak ill of the  gods.\" Therefore happiness consists in power.    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is the perfect good. But the highest  perfection for man is to be able to rule others; which belongs to  those who are in power. Therefore happiness consists in power.    Obj. 3: Further, since happiness is supremely desirable, it is  contrary to that which is before all to be shunned. But, more than  aught else, men shun servitude, which is contrary to power. Therefore  happiness consists in power.    _On the contrary,_ Happiness is the perfect good. But power is most  imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), \"the power of man  cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path  of anxiety\": and further on: \"Think you a man is powerful who is  surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom  he fears still more?\"    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for happiness to consist in power;  and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of  principle, as is stated in _Metaph._ v, 12, whereas happiness has the  nature of last end. Secondly, because power has relation to good and  evil: whereas happiness is man's proper and perfect good. Wherefore  some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by  virtue, rather than in power itself.    Now four general reasons may be given to prove that happiness  consists in none of the foregoing external goods. First, because,  since happiness is man's supreme good, it is incompatible with any  evil. Now all the foregoing can be found both in good and in evil  men. Secondly, because, since it is the nature of happiness to  \"satisfy of itself,\" as stated in _Ethic._ i, 7, having gained  happiness, man cannot lack any needful good. But after acquiring any  one of the foregoing, man may still lack many goods that are  necessary to him; for instance, wisdom, bodily health, and such like.  Thirdly, because, since happiness is the perfect good, no evil can  accrue to anyone therefrom. This cannot be said of the foregoing: for  it is written (Eccles. 5:12) that \"riches\" are sometimes \"kept to the  hurt of the owner\"; and the same may be said of the other three.  Fourthly, because man is ordained to happiness through principles  that are in him; since he is ordained thereto naturally. Now the four  goods mentioned above are due rather to external causes, and in most  cases to fortune; for which reason they are called goods of fortune.  Therefore it is evident that happiness nowise consists in the  foregoing.    Reply Obj. 1: God's power is His goodness: hence He cannot use His  power otherwise than well. But it is not so with men. Consequently it  is not enough for man's happiness, that he become like God in power,  unless he become like Him in goodness also.    Reply Obj. 2: Just as it is a very good thing for a man to make good  use of power in ruling many, so is it a very bad thing if he makes a  bad use of it. And so it is that power is towards good and evil.    Reply Obj. 3: Servitude is a hindrance to the good use of power:  therefore is it that men naturally shun it; not because man's supreme  good consists in power.  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 5]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in Any Bodily Good?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in bodily  goods. For it is written (Ecclus. 30:16): \"There is no riches above  the riches of the health of the body.\" But happiness consists in that  which is best. Therefore it consists in the health of the body.    Obj. 2: Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v), that \"to be\" is better  than \"to live,\" and \"to live\" is better than all that follows. But  for man's being and living, the health of the body is necessary.  Since, therefore, happiness is man's supreme good, it seems that  health of the body belongs more than anything else to happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, the more universal a thing is, the higher the  principle from which it depends; because the higher a cause is, the  greater the scope of its power. Now just as the causality of the  efficient cause consists in its flowing into something, so the  causality of the end consists in its drawing the appetite. Therefore,  just as the First Cause is that which flows into all things, so the  last end is that which attracts the desire of all. But being itself  is that which is most desired by all. Therefore man's happiness  consists most of all in things pertaining to his being, such as the  health of the body.    _On the contrary,_ Man surpasses all other animals in regard to  happiness. But in bodily goods he is surpassed by many animals; for  instance, by the elephant in longevity, by the lion in strength, by  the stag in fleetness. Therefore man's happiness does not consist in  goods of the body.    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for man's happiness to consist in  the goods of the body; and this for two reasons. First, because, if a  thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot  consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not  intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship entrusted to him,  since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to  navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he  may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason;  according to Ecclus. 15:14: \"God made man from the beginning and left  him in the hand of his own counsel.\" Now it is evident that man is  ordained to something as his end: since man is not the supreme good.  Therefore the last end of man's reason and will cannot be the  preservation of man's being.    Secondly, because, granted that the end of man's will and reason be  the preservation of man's being, it could not be said that the end of  man is some good of the body. For man's being consists in soul and  body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the  being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above (I,  Q. 75, A. 2); and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its  form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion,  that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the  body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end.  Consequently happiness, which is man's last end, cannot consist in  goods of the body.    Reply Obj. 1: Just as the body is ordained to the soul, as its end,  so are external goods ordained to the body itself. And therefore it  is with reason that the good of the body is preferred to external  goods, which are signified by \"riches,\" just as the good of the soul  is preferred to all bodily goods.    Reply Obj. 2: Being taken simply, as including all perfection of  being, surpasses life and all that follows it; for thus being itself  includes all these. And in this sense Dionysius speaks. But if we  consider being itself as participated in this or that thing, which  does not possess the whole perfection of being, but has imperfect  being, such as the being of any creature; then it is evident that  being itself together with an additional perfection is more  excellent. Hence in the same passage Dionysius says that things that  live are better than things that exist, and intelligent better than  living things.    Reply Obj. 3: Since the end corresponds to the beginning; this  argument proves that the last end is the first beginning of being, in  Whom every perfection of being is: Whose likeness, according to their  proportion, some desire as to being only, some as to living being,  some as to being which is living, intelligent and happy. And this  belongs to few.  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 2, Art. 5]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in Pleasure?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness consists in pleasure.  For since happiness is the last end, it is not desired for something  else, but other things for it. But this answers to pleasure more than  to anything else: \"for it is absurd to ask anyone what is his motive  in wishing to be pleased\" (Ethic. x, 2). Therefore happiness consists  principally in pleasure and delight.    Obj. 2: Further, \"the first cause goes more deeply into the effect  than the second cause\" (De Causis i). Now the causality of the end  consists in its attracting the appetite. Therefore, seemingly that  which moves most the appetite, answers to the notion of the last end.  Now this is pleasure: and a sign of this is that delight so far  absorbs man's will and reason, that it causes him to despise other  goods. Therefore it seems that man's last end, which is happiness,  consists principally in pleasure.

I brought home three Mafulu skulls, which Dr. Keith kindly had measured  at the Royal College of Surgeons, with the following results [28]:--          Skull      |       Length in cm.      |       |       Breadth in cm.      |       |       |       Height in cm.      |       |       |       |       Cranial Index.      |       |       |       |       |       Proportion of      |       |       |       |       |       height to length.        A       17.6    14.0    12.2    79.5    69.3      B       18.2    14.1    13.2    77.5    72.5      C       17.3    12.7    12.5    73.4    72.3      It will be observed that the lowest of these three cranial indices is  a trifle higher than the lowest of those of the head measurements,  that the highest of them is much lower than the highest of those  of the head measurements, and that their average (76.8) is a little  below the average of those of the head measurements.    Dr. Keith had further measurements made of these skulls from the  point of view of prognathism and characters of noses and orbits,  with the following results:          Skull.      |       Basi-nasal length.      |       |       Basi-alveolar length.      |       |       |       Height of nose.      |       |       |       |       Width of nose.      |       |       |       |       |       Height of orbit.      |       |       |       |       |       |       Width of orbit.                mm.      mm.    mm.     mm.     mm.     mm.

He compares  these figures with the average cranial capacity of the male European,  which he puts at 1,500 c.c.    The eyes of the Mafulu people are dark brown and very bright. I never  saw among them those oblique eyes, almost recalling the Mongolian,  which, according to Dr. Seligmann, are found, though rarely only,  on the coast, [29] and of which I saw many instances among the  Kuni people.    Their lips are usually not so thick as are those of the Mekeo and  Roro people, and are generally finer and more delicate in shape.    In view of their Papuan language I kept a sharp look out for the  curious backward sloping foreheads and projecting brow ridges and  Jewish-looking noses which are so often found among the Western  Papuans; but, although I saw a few examples of these, they were rare,  and I did not observe any noticeable tendency in these directions in  the faces of the people generally. [30]    A curious characteristic with them is the big toe, which is usually  much developed, and projects outwards at a larger angle than is the  case with the Roro and Mekeo people, and is much used for holding on  to roots, &c., whilst travelling along their rough mountain paths.    Their general colour is a dark sooty brown, a trifle darker, perhaps,  than that of the Kuni people, and contrasting forcibly with the  varying shades of chocolate which you find among the Roro and Mekeo  people. They are smooth-skinned.    Their hair is frizzly, and generally dark brown, often quite dark,  almost even approaching to black, and sometimes perhaps quite  black. But it is frequently lighter; and indeed I was often, when  observing men's hair lit up by sunshine, impressed by the fact that  its brown colour was not even what we should in Europe call dark. [31]  I often saw marked variations in the depth of hair colour on the  head of the same individual. I saw no examples of the comparatively  straight or curly type of hair which is found in the Pokau district  and elsewhere. [32]    Plate 3 gives front and side views of the mesaticephalic (almost  brachycephalic) skull A and Plate 4 gives similar views of the  dolichocephalic skull C. All the photographs were made as nearly as  possible exactly half the sizes of the originals; but the photographer  has made the front view of skull A about an eighth of an inch too  narrow (with, of course, a corresponding deficiency in height), so  that the tendency to roundness of this skull is not quite sufficiently  shown, and the proportion of its height to its length is reduced,  in the plate. I am not a craniologist, and so I do not attempt to  discuss the more detailed points of interest which arise in connection  with these skulls.    A good idea of the somewhat varying characters of the general physiques  and features of the people will be obtained from my plates; but there  are a few of these plates which I may mention here.    The people shown in Plates 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 16 may, I think, be  regarded as fairly typical, and I would draw attention to the somewhat  Melanesian tendency of feature which is disclosed by the faces of  the man in Plate 6, the young man in the middle in Plate 7 and the  fourth and sixth men from the left in Plate 9; also to the great  diversity shown in Plate 9. The man shown in Plate 10, with his thick  and strong muscular development, is of a type which is occasionally  seen, but which is, I believe, unusual. The two men figured in Plates  11 and 12 are, I think, specially interesting. The one to the right,  with his somewhat backward sloping forehead, and slightly arched nose,  shows a distinct tendency towards the type of the Western Papuan, to  which I have already referred. The other one is in general shape of  head and appearance of features not unlike some of the dwarf people  found by the recent expedition into Dutch New Guinea (see the man to  the left in Plate 4 of the page of illustrations in _The Illustrated  London News_ for September 2, 1911), and indeed there is almost an  Australian tendency in his face. It is noticeable that he has a beard  and moustache, which is quite unusual among the Mafulu. A somewhat  similar type of face may be noticed in one or two of the other plates.      Character and Temperament.    It is difficult to speak with any degree of definiteness on this  question. It must be borne in mind that the Mafulu people have been  very little in touch with white people, the missionaries, who have only  been there since 1905, and on rare occasions a Government official or  scientific traveller, being almost the only white men whom the bulk  of them have ever seen; and they have been but slightly affected by  the outside influences which for some years past have been constantly  brought to bear upon the natives of the adjoining coast line and the  people of the Mekeo plains; so that comparisons of these people with  their more up-to-date neighbours as regards their relative natural  characters may well be in some respects misleading.    Subject, however, to this caution I would say that they are lazy  and easy-going (though not so much so as the Roro and Mekeo people),  lively, excitable, cheerful, merry, fairly intelligent (this being  judged rather from the young people), very superstitious, brave,  with much power of enduring pain, cruel, not more revengeful perhaps  than is usual among uncivilised natives, friendly one with another,  not quarrelsome, but untrustworthy and not over-faithful even in  their dealings with one another, though honest as regards boundaries  and property rights and in the sense of not stealing from one another  within their own communities (this being regarded as a most shameful  offence), and of very loose sexual morality.    A difference between them and the Mekeo and Roro natives is that  they appear to be not so conservative as the latter, being more  ready to abandon old traditions and adopt new ideas; though this  characteristic is one which shows itself in the young people rather  than in the elders with their formed habits.                CHAPTER III    Dress and Ornament      Dress.    The perineal band, made of bark cloth, is the one article of dress  which is universally worn by both men and women.    These bands are made by both men and women, but are coloured by men  only. They are commonly unstained and undecorated; but some of them,  and especially those worn for visiting and at dances, are more or  less decorated. Some that I have noticed are stained in one colour  covering the whole garment; others in two colours arranged in alternate  transverse bands, sometimes with narrow spaces of unstained cloth  between; and again others have bands of one colour alternating with  bands of unstained cloth. Some are decorated with lines or groups  of lines of one colour, or alternating lines or groups of lines of  two colours, painted transversely across the cloth. Others, while  simply stained in one colour or stained or decorated in one of the  ways above described, have another simple terminal design near the  end of the garment.    The men's bands are usually small and narrow, as compared with those  worn by the Roro and Mekeo people; and the women's bands seemed to me  to be generally even narrower than those of the men, particularly in  front. Men's bands, which I have measured, were about 6 inches wide at  one end, narrowing down to about 3 inches at the other; and the widths  of women's bands were 4 or 5 inches or less at one end, narrowing  down to about 2 inches at the other. But the bands of both men and  women, especially those of the latter, often become so crumpled up and  creased with wear that the portion passing between the legs dwindles  down to about an inch or less in width. One is tempted to think, as  regards both men and women,"]]]
