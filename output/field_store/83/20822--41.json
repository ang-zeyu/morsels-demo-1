Strauss was the first to recognize this defect in  the waltz, and he remedied it, so far as it lay within human  skill, by a marvellous use of counter-rhythms, thus infusing  into the dance a simulation of intellectuality.    The weaving together of these elements into one art-fabric has  been the ideal of all poets from Homer to Wagner. The Greeks  idealized their dances; that is to say, they made their dances  fit their declamation. In the last two centuries, and especially  in the middle of the nineteenth, we have danced our highest  flights of impassioned speech. For what is the symphony, sonata,  etc., but a remnant of the dance form? The choric dances of  Stesichorus and Pindar came strangely near our modern forms,  but it was because the form fitted the poem. In our modern  days, we too often, Procrustes-like, make our ideas to fit the  forms. We put our guest, the poetic thought, that comes to us  like a homing bird from out the mystery of the blue sky--we  put this confiding stranger straightway into that iron bed,  the \"sonata form,\" or perhaps even the third rondo form,  for we have quite an assortment. Should the idea survive  and grow too large for the bed, and if we have learned to  love it too much to cut off its feet and thus _make_ it fit  (as did that old robber of Attica), why we run the risk of  having some critic wise in his theoretical knowledge, say,  as was and is said of Chopin, \"He is weak in sonata form!\"    There are two ways of looking at music: first, as impassioned  speech, the nearest psychologically-complete utterance of  emotion known to man; second, as the dance, comprising as it  does all that appeals to our nature. And there is much that is  lovely in this idea of nature--for do not the seasons dance,  and is it not in that ancient measure we have already spoken of,  the trochaic? Long Winter comes with heavy foot, and Spring is  the light-footed. Again, Summer is long, and Autumn short and  cheery; and so our phrase begins again and again. We all know  with what periodicity everything in nature dances, and how the  smallest flower is a marvel of recurring rhymes and rhythms,  with perfume for a melody. How Shakespeare's Beatrice charms us  when she says, \"There a star danced, and under that was I born.\"    And yet man is not part of Nature. Even in the depths of the  primeval forest, that poor savage, whom we found listening  fearfully to the sound of his drum, knew better. Mankind lives  in isolation, and Nature is a thing for him to conquer. For  Nature is a thing that exists, while man _thinks_. Nature is  that which passively lives while man actively wills. It is the  strain of Nature in man that gave him the dance, and it is his  godlike fight against Nature that gave him impassioned speech;  beauty of form and motion on one side, all that is divine in man  on the other; on one side materialism, on the other idealism.    We have traced the origin of the drum, pipe, and the voice in  music. It still remains for us to speak of the lyre and the  lute, the ancestors of our modern stringed instruments. The  relative antiquity of the lyre and the lute as compared with  the harp has been much discussed, the main contention against  the lyre being that it is a more artificial instrument than  the harp; the harp was played with the fingers alone, while the  lyre was played with a plectrum (a small piece of metal, wood,  or ivory). Perhaps it would be safer to take the lute as the  earliest form of the stringed instrument, for, from the very  first, we find two species of instruments with strings, one  played with the fingers, the prototype of our modern harps,  banjos, guitars, etc., the other played with the plectrum,  the ancestor of all our modern stringed instruments played by  means of bows and hammers, such as violins, pianos, etc.    However this may be, one thing is certain, the possession of  these instruments implies already a considerable measure of  culture, for they were not haphazard things. They were made for  a purpose, were invented to fill a gap in the ever-increasing  needs of expression. In Homer we find a description of the  making of a lyre by Hermes, how this making of a lyre from the  shell of a tortoise that happened to pass before the entrance to  the grotto of his mother, Maia, was his first exploit; and that  he made it to accompany his song in praise of his father Zeus.  We must accept this explanation of the origin of the lyre,  namely, that it was deliberately invented to accompany the  voice. For the lyre in its primitive state was never a solo  instrument; the tone was weak and its powers of expression  were exceedingly limited. On the other hand, it furnished an  excellent background for the voice and, which was still more  to the point, the singer could accompany himself. The drum  had too vague a pitch, and the flute or pipe necessitated  another performer, besides having too much similarity of tone  to the voice to give sufficient contrast. Granted then that the  lyre was invented to accompany the voice, and without wasting  time with surmises as to whether the first idea of stringed  instruments was received from the twanging of a bowstring  or the finding of a tortoise shell with the half-dessicated  tendons of the animal still stretching across it, let us find  when the instrument was seemingly first used.    That the lyre and lute are of Asiatic origin is generally  conceded, and even in comparatively modern times, Asia seems to  be the home of its descendants. The Tartars have been called  the troubadours of Asia--and of Asia in the widest sense of  the word--penetrating into the heart of the Caucasus on the  west and reaching through the country eastward to the shores of  the Yellow Sea. Marco Polo, the celebrated Venetian traveller,  and M. Huc, a French missionary to China and Thibet, as well  as Spencer, Atkinson, and many others, speak of the wandering  bards of Asia. Marco Polo's account of how Jenghiz Kahn, the  great Mongol conqueror, sent an expedition composed entirely of  minstrels against Mien, a city of 30,000 inhabitants, has often  been quoted to show what an abundance--or perhaps superfluity  would be the better word--of musicians he had at his court.    That the lyre could not be of Greek origin is proved by the fact  that no root has been discovered in the language for _lyra_,  although there are many special names for varieties of the  instrument. Leaving aside the question of the geographical  origin of the instrument, we may say, broadly, that wherever  we find a nation with even the smallest approach to a history,  there we shall find bards singing of the exploits of heroes,  and always to the accompaniment of the lyre or the lute. For at  last, by means of these instruments, impassioned speech was able  to lift itself permanently above the level of everyday life,  and its lofty song could dispense with the soft, sensuous  lull of the flute. And we shall see later how these bards  became seers, and how even our very angels received harps,  so closely did the instrument become associated with what I  have called impassioned speech, which, in other words, is the  highest expression of what we consider godlike in man.          III    THE MUSIC OF THE HEBREWS AND THE HINDUS      The music of the Hebrews presents one of the most interesting  subjects in musical history, although it has an unfortunate  defect in common with so many kindred subjects, namely,  that the most learned dissertation must invariably end with  a question mark. When we read in Josephus that Solomon had  200,000 singers, 40,000 harpers, 40,000 sistrum players, and  200,000 trumpeters, we simply do not believe it. Then too  there is lack of unanimity in the matter of the essential  facts. One authority, describing the _machol_, says it is  a stringed instrument resembling a modern viola; another  describes it as a wind instrument somewhat like a bagpipe;  still another says it is a metal ring with a bell attachment  like an Egyptian sistrum; and finally an equally respected  authority claims that the _machol_ was not an instrument at  all, but a dance. Similarly the _maanim_ has been described  as a trumpet, a kind of rattle box with metal clappers, and  we even have a full account in which it figures as a violin.    The temple songs which we know have evidently been much  changed by surrounding influences, just as in modern synagogues  the architecture has not held fast to ancient Hebrew models  but has been greatly influenced by different countries and  peoples. David may be considered the founder of Hebrew music,  and his reign has been well called an \"idyllic episode in the  otherwise rather grim history of Israel.\"    Of the instruments named in the Scriptures, that called the  harp in our English translation was probably the _kinnor_,  a kind of lyre played by means of a plectrum, which was a  small piece of metal, wood, or bone. The psaltery or _nebel_  (which was of course derived from the Egyptian _nabla_, just  as the _kinnor_ probably was in some mysterious manner derived  from the Chinese _kin_) was a kind of dulcimer or zither, an  oblong box with strings which were struck by small hammers. The  timbrel corresponds to our modern tambourine. The _schofar_  and _keren_ were horns. The former was the well-known ram's horn  which is still blown on the occasion of the Jewish New Year.    In the Talmud mention is made of an organ consisting of ten  pipes which could give one hundred different sounds, each pipe  being able "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#6)"],[1,"it.  To you, reader, it may be that it points the way  of eternal life; to the benighted Rommany-English-Hindoo, it indicates  nothing more than the same old weary track of daily travel; of wayfare  and warfare with the world, seeking food and too often finding none;  living for petty joys and driven by dire need; lying down with poverty  and rising with hunger, ignorant in his very wretchedness of a thousand  things which he _ought_ to want, and not knowing enough to miss them.    Just as the reader a thousand, or perhaps only a hundred, years  hence--should a copy of this work be then extant--may pity the writer of  these lines for his ignorance of the charming comforts, as yet unborn,  which will render _his_ physical condition so delightful.  To thee, oh,  future reader, I am what the Gipsy is to me!  Wait, my dear boy of the  Future--wait--till _you_ get to heaven!    Which is a long way off from the Gipsies.  Let us return.  We had spoken  _of patteran_, or of crosses by the way-side, and this led naturally  enough to speaking of Him who died on the Cross, and of wandering.  And I  must confess that it was with great interest I learned that the Gipsies,  from a very singular and Rommany point of view, respect, and even pay  him, in common with the peasantry in some parts of England, a peculiar  honour.  For this reason I bade the Gipsy carefully repeat his words, and  wrote them down accurately.  I give them in the original, with a  translation.  Let me first state that my informant was not quite clear in  his mind as to whether the Boro Divvus, or Great Day, was Christmas or  New Year's, nor was he by any means certain on which Christ was born.  But  he knew very well that when it came, the Gipsies took great pains to burn  an ash-wood fire.    \"Avali--adusta cheirus I've had to jal dui or trin mees of a Boro Divvus  sig' in the sala, to lel ash-wood for the yag.  That was when I was a  bitti chavo, for my dadas always would keravit.    \"An' we kairs it because foki pens our Saviour, the tikno Duvel was born  apre the Boro Divvus, 'pre the puv, avree in the temm, like we Rommanis,  and he was brought 'pre pash an ash yag--(_Why you can dick dovo adree  the Scriptures_!).    \"The ivy and holly an' pine rukks never pookered a lav when our Saviour  was gaverin' of his kokero, an' so they tools their jivaben saw (sar) the  wen, and dicks selno saw the besh; but the ash, like the surrelo rukk,  pukkered atut him, where he was gaverin, so they have to hatch mullo  adree the wen.  And so we Rommany chals always hatchers an ash yag saw  the Boro Divvuses.  For the tickno duvel was chivved a wadras 'pre the  puvius like a Rommany chal, and kistered apre a myla like a Rommany, an'  jalled pale the tem a mangin his moro like a Rom.  An' he was always a  pauveri choro mush, like we, till he was nashered by the Gorgios.    \"An' he kistered apre a myla?  Avali.  Yeckorus he putchered the pash-  grai if he might kister her, but she pookered him _kek_.  So because the  pash-grai wouldn't rikker him, she was sovahalled againsus never to be a  dye or lel tiknos.  So she never lelled kek, nor any cross either.    \"Then he putchered the myla to rikker him, and she penned: 'Avali!' so he  pet a cross apre laki's dumo.  And to the divvus the myla has a trin  bongo drum and latchers tiknos, but the pash-grai has kek.  So the mylas  'longs of the Rommanis.\"    (TRANSLATION.)--\"Yes--many a time I've had to go two or three miles of a  Great Day (Christmas), early in the morning, to get ash-wood for the  fire.  That was when I was a small boy, for my father always would do it.    \"And we do it because people say our Saviour, the small God, was born on  the Great Day, in the field, out in the country, like we Rommanis, and he  was brought up by an ash-fire.\"    Here a sudden sensation of doubt or astonishment at my ignorance seemed  to occur to my informant, for he said,--    \"Why, you can see that in the Scriptures!\"    To which I answered, \"But the Gipsies have Scripture stories different  from those of the Gorgios, and different ideas about religion.  Go on  with your story.  Why do you burn ash-wood?\"    \"The ivy, and holly, and pine trees, never told a word where our Saviour  was hiding himself, and so they keep alive all the winter, and look green  all the year.  But the ash, like the oak (_lit_. strong tree), told of  him (_lit_. across, against him), where he was hiding, so they have to  remain dead through the winter.  And so we Gipsies always burn an ash-  fire every Great Day.  For the Saviour was born in the open field like a  Gipsy, and rode on an ass like one, and went round the land a begging his  bread like a Rom.  And he was always a poor wretched man like us, till he  was destroyed by the Gentiles.    \"And He rode on an ass?  Yes.  Once he asked the mule if he might ride  her, but she told him no.  So because the mule would not carry him, she  was cursed never to be a mother or have children.  So she never had any,  nor any cross either.    \"Then he asked the ass to carry him, and she said 'Yes;' so he put a  cross upon her back.  And to this day the ass has a cross and bears  young, but the mule has none.  So the asses belong to (are peculiar to)  the Gipsies.\"    There was a pause, when I remarked--    \"That is a _fino gudlo_--a fine story; and all of it about an ash tree.  Can you tell me anything about the _surrelo rukk_--the strong tree--the  oak?\"    \"Only what I've often heard our people say about its life.\"    \"And what is that?\"    \"Dui hundred besh a hatchin, dui hundred besh nasherin his chuckko, dui  hundred besh 'pre he mullers, and then he nashers sar his ratt and he's  kekoomi kushto.\" {30}    \"That is good, too.  There are a great many men who would like to live as  long.\"    \"_Tacho_, true.  But an old coat can hold out better than a man.  If a  man gets a hole in him he dies, but his _chukko_ (coat) can be _toofered_  and _sivved apre_ (mended and sewed up) for ever.  So, unless a man could  get a new life every year, as they say the _hepputs_, the little lizards  do, he needn't hope to live like an oak.\"    \"Do the lizards get a new life every year?\"    \"_Avali_.  A _hepput_ only lives one year, and then he begins life over  again.\"    \"Do snails live as long as lizards?\"    \"Not when I find 'em rya--if I am hungry.  Snails are good eating. {32}  You can find plenty on the hedges.  When they're going about in the  fields or (are found) under wood, they are not good eating.  The best are  those which are kept, or live through (literally _sleep_) the winter.  Take 'em and wash 'em and throw 'em into the kettle, with water and a  little salt.  The broth's good for the yellow jaundice.\"    \"So you call a snail\"--    \"A bawris,\" said the old fortune-teller.    \"Bawris!  The Hungarian Gipsies call it a _bouro_.  But in Germany the  Rommanis say stargoli.  I wonder why a snail should be a stargoli.\"    \"I know,\" cried the brother, eagerly.  \"When you put a snail on the fire  it cries out and squeaks just like a little child.  Stargoli means 'four  cries.'\"    I had my doubts as to the accuracy of this startling derivation, but said  nothing.  The same Gipsy on a subsequent occasion, being asked what he  would call a _roan_ horse in Rommany, replied promptly--    \"A matchno grai\"--a fish-horse.    \"Why a matchno grai?\"    \"Because a fish has a roan (_i.e_., roe), hasn't it?  Leastways I can't  come no nearer to it, if it ain't that.\"    But he did better when I was puzzling my brain, as the learned Pott and  Zippel had done before me, over the possible origin of churro or tchurro,  \"a ball, or anything round,\" when he suggested--    \"Rya--I should say that as a _churro_ is round, and a _curro_ or cup is  round, and they both sound alike and look alike, it must be all werry  much the same thing.\" {33}    \"Can you tell me anything more about snails?\" I asked, reverting to a  topic which, by the way, I have observed is like that of the hedgehog, a  favourite one with Gipsies.    \"Yes; you can cure warts with the big black kind that have no shells.\"    \"You mean slugs.  I never knew they were fit to cure anything.\"    \"Why, that's one of the things that everybody knows.  When you get a wart  on your hands, you go on to the road or into the field till you find a  slug, one of the large kind with no shell (literally, with no house upon  him), and stick it on the thorn of a blackthorn in a hedge, and as the  snail dies, one day after the other, for four or five days, the wart will  die away.  Many a time I've told that to Gorgios, and Gorgios have done  it, and the warts have gone away (literally, cleaned away) from their  hands.\" {34}    Here the Gipsy began to inquire very politely if smoking were offensive  to me; and as I assured him that it was not, he took out his pipe.  And  knowing by experience that nothing is more conducive to sociability, be  it among Chippeways or Gipsies, than that smoking which is among our  Indians, literally a burnt-offering, {35} I produced a small clay pipe of  the time of Charles the Second, given to me by a gentleman who has the  amiable taste to collect such curiosities, and give them to his friends  under the express condition that they shall be smoked, and not laid away  as relics of the past.  If you move in _etching_ circles, dear readers,  you will at once know to whom I refer.    The quick eye of the Gipsy at once observed my pipe.    \"That is a _crow-swagler_--a crow-pipe,\" he remarked.    \"Why a crow-pipe?\"    \"I don't know.  Some Gipsies call 'em _mullos' swaglers_, or dead men's  pipes, because those who made 'em were dead long ago.  There are places  in England where you can find 'em by dozens in the fields.  I never  dicked (saw) one with so long a stem to it as yours.  And they're old,  very old.  What is it you call it before everything\" (here he seemed  puzzled for a word) \"when the world was a-making?\"    \"The Creation.\"    \"Avali--that's it, the"]]]
