Let I-S get an inkling of his rash action and the Company  would have them up before the Board to be stripped of all their rights  in the Service. Just because of his own stupidity--his pride in being  able to break through where Van Rycke and the Captain had faced a stone  wall. And, worse than the future which could face the Queen, was the  thought that he might have introduced some dangerous drug into Sargol  with his gift of those few leaves. When would he learn? He threw himself  face down on his bunk and despondently pictured the string of calamities  which could and maybe would stem from his thoughtless and hasty action.    Within the Queen night and day were mechanical--the lighting in the  cabins did not vary much. Dane did not know how long he lay there forcing  his mind to consider his stupid action, making himself face that in the  Service there were no short cuts which endangered others--not unless  those taking the risks were Terrans.    \"Dane--!\" Rip Shannon's voice cut through his self-imposed nightmare. But  he refused to answer. \"Dane--Van wants you on the double!\"    Why? To bring him up before Jellico probably. Dane schooled his  expression, got up, pulling his tunic straight, still unable to meet  Rip's eyes. Shannon was just one of those he had let down so badly. But  the other did not notice his mood. \"Wait 'til you see them--! Half Sargol  must be here yelling for trade!\"    That comment was so far from what he had been expecting that Dane was  startled out of his own gloomy thoughts. Rip's brown face was one wide  smile, his black eyes danced--it was plain he was honestly elated.    \"Get a move on, fire rockets,\" he urged, \"or Van will blast you for  fair!\"    Dane did move, up the ladder to the next level and out on the port ramp.  What he saw below brought him up short. Evening had come to Sargol but  the scene immediately below was not in darkness. Blazing torches  advanced in lines from the grass forest and the portable flood light of  the spacer added to the general glare, turning night into noonday.    Van Rycke and Jellico sat on stools facing at least five of the seven  major chieftains with whom they had conferred to no purpose earlier. And  behind these leaders milled a throng of lesser Salariki. Yes, there was  at least one carrying chair--and also an orgel from the back of which a  veiled noblewoman was being assisted to dismount by two retainers. The  women of the clans were coming--which could mean only that trade was at  last in progress. But trade for what?    Dane strode down the ramp. He saw Paft, his hand carefully covered by his  trade cloth, advance to Van Rycke, whose own fingers were decently veiled  by a handkerchief. Under the folds of fabric their hands touched. The  bargaining was in the first stages. And it was important enough for the  clan leaders to conduct themselves. Where, according to Cam's records, it  had been usual to delegate that power to a favored liege man.    Catching the light from the ship's beam and from the softer flares of the  Salariki torches was a small pile of stones resting on a stool to one  side. Dane drew a deep breath. He had heard the Koros stones described,  had seen the tri-dee print of one found among Cam's recordings but the  reality was beyond his expectations. He knew the technical analysis of  the gems--that they were, as the amber of Terra, the fossilized resin  exuded by ancient plants (maybe the ancestors of the grass trees) long  buried in the saline deposits of the shallow seas where chemical changes  had taken place to produce the wonder jewels. In color they shaded from a  rosy apricot to a rich mauve, but in their depths other colors, silver,  fiery gold, spun sparks which seemed to move as the gem was turned.  And--which was what first endeared them to the Salariki--when worn  against the skin and warmed by body heat they gave off a perfume which  enchanted not only the Sargolian natives but all in the Galaxy wealthy  enough to own one.    On another stool placed at Van Rycke's right hand, as that bearing the  Koros stones was at Paft's, was a transparent plastic box containing some  wrinkled brownish leaves. Dane moved as unobtrusively as he could to his  proper place at such a trading session, behind Van Rycke. More Salariki  were tramping out of the forest, torch bearing retainers and cloaked  warriors. A little to one side was a third party Dane had not seen  before.    They were clustered about a staff which had been driven into the ground,  a staff topped with a white streamer marking a temporary trading ground.  These were Salariki right enough but they did not wear the colorful garb  of those about them, instead they were all clad alike in muffling,  sleeved robes of a drab green--the storm priests--their robes denoting  the color of the Sargolian sky just before the onslaught of their worst  tempests. Cam had not left many clues concerning the religion of the  Salariki, but the storm priests had, in narrowly defined limits, power,  and their recognition of the Terran Traders would add to good feeling.    In the knot of storm priests a Terran stood--Medic Tau--and he was  talking earnestly with the leader of the religious party. Dane would have  given much to have been free to cross and ask Tau a question or two. Was  all this assembly the result of the discovery in the hydro? But even as  he asked himself that, the trade cloths were shaken from the hands of the  bargainers and Van Rycke gave an order over his shoulder.    \"Measure out two spoonsful of the dried leaves into a box--\" he pointed  to a tiny plastic container.    With painstaking care Dane followed directions. At the same time a  servant of the Salarik chief swept the handful of gems from the other  stool and dropped them in a heap before Van Rycke, who transferred them  to a strong box resting between his feet. Paft arose--but he had hardly  quitted the trading seat before one of the lesser clan leaders had taken  his place, the bargaining cloth ready looped loosely about his wrist.    It was at that point that the proceedings were interrupted. A new party  came into the open, their utilitarian Trade tunics made a drab blot as  they threaded their way in a compact group through the throng of  Salariki. I-S men! So they had not lifted from Sargol.    They showed no signs of uneasiness--it was as if _their_ rights were  being infringed by the Free Traders. And Kallee, their Cargo-master,  swaggered straight to the bargaining point. The chatter of Salariki  voices was stilled, the Sargolians withdrew a little, letting one party  of Terrans face the other, sensing drama to come. Neither Van Rycke nor  Jellico spoke, it was left to Kallee to state his case.    \"You've crooked your orbit this time, bright boys,\" his jeer was a paean  of triumph. \"Code Three--Article six--or can't you absorb rules tapes  with your thick heads?\"    Code Three--Article six, Dane searched his memory for that law of the  Service. The words flashed into his mind as the auto-learner had planted  them during his first year of training back in the Pool.    \"To no alien race shall any Trader introduce any drug, food, or drink  from off world, until such a substance has been certified as nonharmful  to the aliens.\"    There it was! I-S had them and it was all his fault. But if he had been  so wrong, why in the world did Van Rycke sit there trading, condoning the  error and making it into a crime for which they could be summoned before  the Board and struck off the rolls of the Service?    Van Rycke smiled gently. \"Code Four--Article two,\" he quoted with the  genial air of one playing gift-giver at a Forkidan feasting.    Code Four, Article two: Any organic substance offered for trade must be  examined by a committee of trained medical experts, an equal  representation of Terrans and aliens.    Kallee's sneering smile did not vanish. \"Well,\" he challenged, \"where's  your board of experts?\"    \"Tau!\" Van Rycke called to the Medic with the storm priests. \"Will you  ask your colleague to be so kind as to allow the Cargo-master Kallee to  be presented?\"    The tall, dark young Terran Medic spoke to the priest beside him and  together they came across the clearing. Van Rycke and Jellico both arose  and inclined their heads in honor to the priests, as did the chief with  whom they had been about to deal.    \"Reader of clouds and master of many winds,\" Tau's voice flowed with the  many voweled titles of the Sargolian, \"may I bring before your face  Cargo-master Kallee, a servant of Inter-Solar in the realm of Trade?\"    The storm priest's shaven skull and body gleamed steel gray in the light.  His eyes, of that startling blue-green, regarded the I-S party with  cynical detachment.    \"You wish of me?\" Plainly he was one who believed in getting down to  essentials at once.    Kallee could not be overawed. \"These Free Traders have introduced among  your people a powerful drug which will bring much evil,\" he spoke slowly  in simple words as if he were addressing a cub.    \"You have evidence of such evil?\" countered the storm priest. \"In what  manner is this new plant evil?\"    For a moment Kallee was disconcerted. But he rallied quickly. \"It has  not been tested--you do not know how it will affect your people--\"    The storm priest shook his head impatiently. \"We are not lacking in  intelligence, Trader. This plant _has_ been tested, both by your master  of life secrets and ours. There is no harm in it--rather it is a good  thing, to be highly prized--so highly that we shall give thanks that it  was brought unto us. This speech-together is finished.\" He pulled the  loose folds of his robe closer about him and walked away.    \"Now,\" Van Rycke addressed the I-S party, \"I must ask you to withdraw.  Under the rules of Trade your presence here can be actively resented--\"    But Kallee had lost little of his assurance. \"You haven't heard the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#6)"],[1,"ta. When that assembly became           obsolete, the priests summoned a formal meeting of thirty           lictors, and their sanction of an act of adoption was still           called _lex curiata_. Galba was now _Pontifex maximus_.        [40] Galba belonged to the _Gens Sulpicia_, and was connected           through his mother, Mummia, with Q. Lutatius Catulus, who had           led the senatorial party in the first half of the last           century.        [41] i.e. Galba's great-grandfather had fought for Caesar           against Piso's ancestor, Pompey.        [42] The children of Julia and Agrippa.        [43] Crassus Scribonianus, cp. chap. 47, and iv. 39.        [44] i.e. co-optation, employed in former days to raise a           special contingent for emergencies.      GALBA'S MEASURES OF PRECAUTION    Reports of the German rebellion grew daily more insistent and the  public was always ready to believe any news, provided it was bad.  Accordingly the senate decided that a commission must be sent to the  army in Germany. It was discussed in private whether Piso should go  himself to add dignity to the commission, since he could carry the  authority of the emperor, while the others represented the senate. It  was also proposed to send Laco, the prefect of the Guards, but he  objected. The senate had allowed Galba to nominate the commissioners  and he showed the most miserable indecision, now nominating members,  now excusing them, now making exchanges, yielding always to pressure  from people who wanted to go or to stay at home according as they were  determined by their hopes or their fears. The next question was         20  one of finance. After investigating all possible sources it seemed  most reasonable to recover the revenue from those quarters where the  cause of the deficit lay. Nero had squandered in lavish presents two  thousand two hundred million sesterces.[45] Galba gave instructions  that these monies should be recovered from the individual recipients,  leaving each a tithe of their original gift. However, in each case  there was scarcely a tenth part left, for these worthless spendthrifts  had run through Nero's money as freely as they had squandered their  own: they had no real property or capital left, nothing but the  apparatus of their luxury. Thirty of the knights were entrusted with  the duty of recovering the money. This commission, for which there was  no precedent, proved vastly unpopular owing to the scope of its  authority, and the large number of the victims. Every quarter seemed  beset with sales and brokers and lawsuits. And yet lively satisfaction  was caused by the discovery that the beneficiaries of Nero's bounty  were as poor as the victims of his greed.    At this time several officers were cashiered, Antonius Taurus and  Antonius Naso of the Guards, Aemilius Pacensis of the City Garrison,  and Julius Fronto of the Police.[46] However, this proved no remedy.  The others only began to feel alarmed, thinking that Galba's craft and  timidity had sacrificed a few, while his suspicions rested on them  all.

THE RISE OF OTHO    Meanwhile Otho had nothing to hope from a peaceful settlement: all      21  his plans demanded a disturbance. Many motives spurred him on: his  extravagance would have ruined a prince, and his poverty have  perplexed a private person: he was angry with Galba and jealous of  Piso. He also alleged fears for his safety, by way of whetting his  ambition. 'I proved a nuisance to Nero,' he would say, 'and can  scarcely expect the compliment of a second exile to Lusitania.[47]  Besides, monarchs always hate and suspect the man who is mentioned as  \"next to the throne\". This was what did me harm with the old emperor,  and it will weigh still more with the youthful Piso, who is naturally  savage and has been exasperated by a long period of exile. It would be  easy to kill me. I must do and dare while Galba's authority is on the  wane and Piso's not yet established. These times of change suit big  enterprises; inaction is more deadly than daring; there is no call for  delay. Death is the natural end for all alike, and the only difference  is between fame and oblivion afterwards. Seeing that the same end  awaits the innocent and the guilty, a man of spirit should at least  deserve his fate.'    Otho's character was by no means so effeminate as his person. His       22  intimate freedmen and slaves, who were allowed a licence unusual in  private households, dangled before him the baits for which he was  greedy: the luxuries of Nero's Court, the marriages he could make, the  adulteries he could commit, and all the other imperial pleasures. They  were his, they pointed out, if he would bestir himself; it was  shameful to lie quiet and leave them to others. He was also incited by  the astrologers, who declared that their study of the stars pointed to  great changes and a year of glory for Otho. Creatures of this class  always deceive the ambitious, though those in power distrust them.  Probably we shall go on for ever proscribing them and keeping them by  us.[48] Poppaea[49] had always had her boudoir full of these  astrologers, the worst kind of outfit for a royal menage. One of them,  called Ptolemy, had gone with Otho to Spain[50] and foretold that he  would outlive Nero. This came true and Otho believed in him. He now  based his vague conjectures on the computations of Galba's age and  Otho's youth, and persuaded him that he would ascend the throne. But,  though the man had no real skill, Otho accepted the prophecy as if it  was the finger of fate. Human nature always likes to believe what it  cannot understand.    Nor was Ptolemy himself slow to incite his master to crime, to          23  which it is only a short step from such ambitions. But whether his  criminal designs were deliberate or suddenly conceived, it is  impossible to say. He had long been courting the goodwill of the  soldiers either in the hope of being adopted by Galba or to prepare  the way for treason. On the road from Spain, while the men were  marching or on outpost duty, he would address the veterans by name,  reminding them how he and they had served together under Nero, and  calling them his comrades. He renewed acquaintance with some, asked  after others and helped them with money or influence, frequently  letting fall complaints and ambiguous remarks about Galba, using all  the arts which work upon uneducated minds. The soldiers grumbled  bitterly at the exertions of the march, the shortage of provisions,  and the strict discipline. What they were used to was a journey to the  Campanian Lakes or Greek seaports on board ship;[51] they found it  hard to struggle over the Pyrenees and Alps, and march immense  distances under arms.    While the soldiers were thus already fired with discontent,             24  Maevius Pudens, one of Tigellinus'[52] intimates, added fuel to their  feelings by luring on all who were naturally unstable or in need of  money, or rashly eager for a change. Eventually, whenever Galba dined  with him, Otho went the length of presenting a hundred sesterces to  each of the soldiers on guard, on the pretext that this was instead of  entertaining them.[53] This system of public largess Otho extended by  making presents in confidence to individuals, and such spirit did he  show in bribery that when a member of the Body Guard, Cocceius  Proculus, brought an action to claim part of his neighbour's farm,  Otho bought the whole property out of his own pocket and gave it to  him. He was enabled to do this by the inefficiency of the Prefect  Laco, who was no less blind to notorious than to secret scandals.    Otho then put Onomastus, one of his freedmen, in charge of the          25  projected crime, and Onomastus took into his confidence Barbius  Proculus, an aide-de-camp, and a subaltern named Veturius, both in the  Body Guard.[54] Having assured himself by many interviews that they  were both bold and cunning, Otho proceeded to load them with bribes  and promises, providing them with funds to enable them to test the  feelings of the others. And so a couple of common soldiers took it  upon them to transfer the Roman Empire: and they did it. A very few  were admitted as accomplices. These, by various devices, worked on the  indecision of the others. The non-commissioned officers who had been  promoted by Nymphidius felt themselves under suspicion; the private  soldiers were indignant and in despair at the constant postponement of  Galba's largess; some few were fired by the recollection of Nero's  regime and longed for the days of licence; all in common shared the  fear of being drafted out of the Praetorian Guards.    The infection of treason soon spread to the legions and                 26  auxiliaries, whose excitement had been aroused as soon as they heard  that the armies of Germany were wavering in their allegiance. So, as  the disloyal were ready for treason and the loyal shut their eyes,  they at first determined to acclaim Otho as he was returning from  dinner on the night of the fourteenth. However, they hesitated: the  darkness spelt uncertainty, the troops were scattered all over the  town, and unanimity could scarcely be expected from drunken men. They  were not deterred by any affection for their country's honour, which  they were deliberately preparing to stain with its emperor's blood,  but they were afraid that, as Otho was unknown to the majority, some  one else might by mistake be offered to the Pannonian or German  legions and proclaimed emperor. Some evidence of the brewing plot  leaked out, but it was suppressed by the conspirators. Rumours even  reached Galba's ears, but Laco made light of them, being totally  ignorant of soldiers' characters, hostile to"]]]
