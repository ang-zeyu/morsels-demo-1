Edward came to Norham-on-Tweed in May 1291, proclaimed himself Lord  Paramount, and was accepted as such by the twelve candidates for the  Crown (June 3).  The great nobles thus, to serve their ambitions,  betrayed their country: _the communitas_ (whatever that term may here  mean) made a futile protest.    As lord among his vassals, Edward heard the pleadings and evidence in  autumn 1292; and out of the descendants, in the female line, of David  Earl of Huntingdon, youngest son of David I., he finally (November 17,  1292) preferred John Balliol (_great-grandson_ of the earl through his  eldest daughter) to Bruce the Old, grandfather of the famous Robert  Bruce, and _grandson_ of Earl David's second daughter.  The decision,  according to our ideas, was just; no modern court could set it aside.  But  Balliol was an unpopular weakling--\"an empty tabard,\" the people said--and  Edward at once subjected him, king as he was, to all the humiliations of  a petty vassal.  He was summoned into his Lord's Court on the score of  the bills of tradesmen.  If Edward's deliberate policy was to goad  Balliol into resistance and then conquer Scotland absolutely, in the  first of these aims he succeeded.    In 1294 Balliol was summoned, with his Peers, to attend Edward in  Gascony.  Balliol, by advice of a council (1295), sought a French  alliance and a French marriage for his son, named Edward; he gave the  Annandale lands of his enemy Robert Bruce (father of the king to be) to  Comyn, Earl of Buchan.  He besieged Carlisle, while Edward took Berwick,  massacred the people, and captured Sir William Douglas, father of the  good Lord James.    In the war which followed, Edward broke down resistance by a sanguinary  victory at Dunbar, captured John Comyn of Badenoch (the Red Comyn),  received from Balliol (July 7, 1296) the surrender of his royal claims,  and took the oaths of the Steward of Scotland and the Bruces, father and  son.  He carried to Westminster the Black Rood of St Margaret and the  famous stone of Scone, a relic of the early Irish dynasty of the Scots;  as far north as Elgin he rode, receiving the oaths of all persons of note  and influence--except William Wallace.  _His_ name does not appear in the  list of submissions called \"The Ragman's Roll.\"  Between April and  October 1296 the country was subjugated; the castles were garrisoned by  Englishmen.  But by January 1297, Edward's governor, Warenne, Earl of  Surrey, and Ormsby, his Chief Justice, found the country in an uproar,  and at midsummer 1297 the levies of the northern counties of England were  ordered to put down the disorders.        THE YEAR OF WALLACE.      In May the _commune_ of Scotland (whatever the term may here mean) had  chosen Wallace as their leader; probably this younger son of Sir Malcolm  Wallace of Elderslie, in Renfrewshire, had already been distinguished for  his success in skirmishes against the English, as well as for strength  and courage. {36}  The popular account of his early adventures given in  the poem by Blind Harry (1490?) is of no historical value.  His men  destroyed the English at Lanark (May 1297); he was abetted by Wishart,  Bishop of Glasgow, and the Steward; but by July 7, Percy and Clifford,  leading the English army, admitted the Steward, Robert Bruce (the future  king), and Wishart to the English peace at Irvine in Ayrshire.  But the  North was up under Sir Andrew Murray, and \"that thief Wallace\" (to quote  an English contemporary) left the siege of Dundee Castle which he was  conducting to face Warenne on the north bank of the Forth.  On September  11, the English, under Warenne, manoeuvred vaguely at Stirling Bridge,  and were caught on the flank by Wallace's army before they could deploy  on the northern side of the river.  They were cut to pieces, Cressingham  was slain, and Warenne galloped to Berwick, while the Scots harried  Northumberland with great ferocity, which Wallace seems to have been  willing but not often able to control.  By the end of March 1298 he  appears with Andrew Murray as Guardian of the Kingdom for the exiled  Balliol.  This attitude must have aroused the jealousy of the nobles, and  especially of Robert Bruce, who aimed at securing the crown, and who,  after several changes of side, by June 1298 was busy in Edward's service  in Galloway.    Edward then crossed the Border with a great army of perhaps 40,000 men,  met the spearmen of Wallace in their serried phalanxes at Falkirk, broke  the \"schiltrom\" or clump of spears by the arrows of his archers;  slaughtered the archers of Ettrick Forest; scattered the mounted nobles,  and avenged the rout of Stirling (July 22, 1298).  The country remained  unsubdued, but its leaders were at odds among themselves, and Wallace had  retired to France, probably to ask for aid; he may also conceivably have  visited Rome.  The Bishop of St Andrews, Lamberton, with Bruce and the  Red Comyn--deadly rivals--were Guardians of the Kingdom in 1299.  But in  June 1300, Edward, undeterred by remonstrances from the Pope, entered  Scotland; an armistice, however, was accorded to the Holy Father, and the  war, in which the Scots scored a victory at Roslin in February 1293,  dragged on from summer to summer till July 1304.  In these years Bruce  alternately served Edward and conspired against him; the intricacies of  his perfidy are deplorable.    Bruce served Edward during the siege of Stirling, then the central key of  the country.  On its surrender Edward admitted all men to his peace, on  condition of oaths of fealty, except \"Messire Williame le Waleys.\"  Men  of the noblest Scottish names stooped to pursue the hero: he was taken  near Glasgow, and handed over to Sir John Menteith, a Stewart, and son of  the Earl of Menteith.  As Sheriff of Dumbartonshire, Menteith had no  choice but to send the hero in bonds to England.  But, if Menteith  desired to escape the disgrace with which tradition brands his name, he  ought to have refused the English blood-price for the capture of Wallace.  He made no such refusal.  As an outlaw, Wallace was hanged at London; his  limbs, like those of the great Montrose, were impaled on the gates of  various towns.    What we really know about the chief popular hero of his country, from  documents and chronicles, is fragmentary; and it is hard to find anything  trustworthy in Blind Harry's rhyming \"Wallace\" (1490), plagiarised as it  is from Barbour's earlier poem (1370) on Bruce. {38}  But Wallace was  truly brave, disinterested, and indomitable.  Alone among the leaders he  never turned his coat, never swore and broke oaths to Edward.  He arises  from obscurity, like Jeanne d'Arc; like her, he is greatly victorious;  like her, he awakens a whole people; like her, he is deserted, and is  unlawfully put to death; while his limbs, like her ashes, are scattered  by the English.  The ravens had not pyked his bones bare before the Scots  were up again for freedom.          CHAPTER VIII.  BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.      The position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable  for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half  subdued and hostile to his rule.  While she was hostile, England, in  attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear.  But Edward supposed  that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving  them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to  his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in  affectionate union.  He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began  to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new  constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor.  But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to  the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the  greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were  fickle and insatiably ambitious.  It is hard to reckon how often Robert  Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had  taken the oath to Edward.  Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304,  but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant.  Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306,  Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce,  after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him  (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church  of the Franciscans in Dumfries.  Apparently Bruce had tried to enlist  Comyn in his conspiracy, and had found him recalcitrant, or feared that  he would be treacherous (February 10, 1306).    The sacrilegious homicide made it impossible for Bruce again to waver.  He  could not hope for pardon; he must be victorious or share the fate of  Wallace.  He summoned his adherents, including young James Douglas,  received the support of the Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, hurried to  Scone, and there was hastily crowned with a slight coronet, in the  presence of but two earls and three bishops.    Edward made vast warlike preparations and forswore leniency, while Bruce,  under papal excommunication, which he slighted, collected a few nobles,  such as Lennox, Atholl, Errol, and a brother of the chief of the Frazers.  Other chiefs, kinsmen of the slain Comyn, among them Macdowal of Argyll,  banded to avenge the victim; Bruce's little force was defeated at Methven  Wood, near Perth, by Aymer de Valence, and prisoners of all ranks were  hanged as traitors, while two bishops were placed in irons.  Bruce took  to the heather, pursued by the Macdowals no less than by the English; his  queen was captured, his brother Nigel was executed; he cut his way to the  wild west coast, aided only by Sir Nial Campbell of Loch Awe, who thus  founded the fortune of his house, and by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"can  trust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word in our heart  and on our lips.    The watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the  moon pretty well. The Selenites* disputed variously about our earth,  and expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air, they said,  must certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon  the necessary free respiration. They considered the moon alone to  be inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or  planetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites, or citizens of the  world, dwelt. What strange things men--no, what strange things Selenites  sometimes take into their heads!    * Dwellers in the moon.      About politics they had a good deal to say. But little Denmark must  take care what it is about, and not run counter to the moon; that  great realm, that might in an ill-humor bestir itself, and dash down a  hail-storm in our faces, or force the Baltic to overflow the sides of  its gigantic basin.    We will, therefore, not listen to what was spoken, and on no condition  run in the possibility of telling tales out of school; but we will  rather proceed, like good quiet citizens, to East Street, and observe  what happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.    He sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star,* that is to say, the  heavy wooden staff, headed with iron spikes, and which had nothing else  in common with its sparkling brother in the sky, had glided from his  hand; while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon, looking  for the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.    *The watchmen in Germany, had formerly, and in some places they still  carry with them, on their rounds at night, a sort of mace or club, known  in ancient times by the above denomination.      \"What's the hour, watchman?\" asked a passer-by. But when the watchman  gave no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a  noisy drinking bout, took it into his head to try what a tweak of the  nose would do, on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance, the body  lay motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. When  the patrol came up, all his comrades, who comprehended nothing of the  whole affair, were seized with a dreadful fright, for dead he was,  and he remained so. The proper authorities were informed of the  circumstance, people talked a good deal about it, and in the morning the  body was carried to the hospital.    Now that would be a very pretty joke, if the spirit when it came back  and looked for the body in East Street, were not to find one. No doubt  it would, in its anxiety, run off to the police, and then to the  \"Hue and Cry\" office, to announce that \"the finder will be handsomely  rewarded,\" and at last away to the hospital; yet we may boldly assert  that the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter, and every  sort of leading-string--the body only makes it stupid.    The seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered, as we have said, to  the hospital, where it was brought into the general viewing-room:  and the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the  galoshes--when the spirit, that was merely gone out on adventures, must  have returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement.  It took its direction towards the body in a straight line; and a few  seconds after, life began to show itself in the man. He asserted that  the preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had  allotted him; he would not for two silver marks again go through what he  had endured while moon-stricken; but now, however, it was over.    The same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured; but  the Shoes meanwhile remained behind.      IV. A Moment of Head Importance--An Evening's \"Dramatic Readings\"--A  Most Strange Journey    Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows, from personal inspection, how  the entrance to Frederick's Hospital looks; but as it is possible that  others, who are not Copenhagen people, may also read this little work,  we will beforehand give a short description of it.    The extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high  railing, the thick iron bars of which are so far apart, that in  all seriousness, it is said, some very thin fellow had of a night  occasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits  in the town. The part of the body most difficult to manage on such  occasions was, no doubt, the head; here, as is so often the case in  the world, long-headed people get through best. So much, then, for the  introduction.    One of the young men, whose head, in a physical sense only, might be  said to be of the thickest, had the watch that evening. The rain poured  down in torrents; yet despite these two obstacles, the young man was  obliged to go out, if it were but for a quarter of an hour; and as  to telling the door-keeper about it, that, he thought, was quite  unnecessary, if, with a whole skin, he were able to slip through the  railings. There, on the floor lay the galoshes, which the watchman  had forgotten; he never dreamed for a moment that they were those of  Fortune; and they promised to do him good service in the wet; so he put  them on. The question now was, if he could squeeze himself through the  grating, for he had never tried before. Well, there he stood.    \"Would to Heaven I had got my head through!\" said he, involuntarily; and  instantly through it slipped, easily and without pain, notwithstanding  it was pretty large and thick. But now the rest of the body was to be  got through!    \"Ah! I am much too stout,\" groaned he aloud, while fixed as in a vice.  \"I had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matter--oh!  oh! I really cannot squeeze myself through!\"    He now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again, but he could not.  For his neck there was room enough, but for nothing more. His first  feeling was of anger; his next that his temper fell to zero. The  Shoes of Fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation; and,  unfortunately, it never occurred to him to wish himself free. The  pitch-black clouds poured down their contents in still heavier torrents;  not a creature was to be seen in the streets. To reach up to the bell  was what he did not like; to cry aloud for help would have availed him  little; besides, how ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a  trap, like an outwitted fox! How was he to twist himself through! He saw  clearly that it was his irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till  dawn, or, perhaps, even late in the morning; then the smith must be  fetched to file away the bars; but all that would not be done so quickly  as he could think about it. The whole Charity School, just opposite,  would be in motion; all the new booths, with their not very  courtier-like swarm of seamen, would join them out of curiosity, and  would greet him with a wild \"hurrah!\" while he was standing in his  pillory: there would be a mob, a hissing, and rejoicing, and jeering,  ten times worse than in the rows about the Jews some years ago--\"Oh, my  blood is mounting to my brain; 'tis enough to drive one mad! I shall go  wild! I know not what to do. Oh! were I but loose; my dizziness would  then cease; oh, were my head but loose!\"    You see he ought to have said that sooner; for the moment he expressed  the wish his head was free; and cured of all his paroxysms of love, he  hastened off to his room, where the pains consequent on the fright the  Shoes had prepared for him, did not so soon take their leave.    But you must not think that the affair is over now; it grows much worse.    The night passed, the next day also; but nobody came to fetch the Shoes.    In the evening \"Dramatic Readings\" were to be given at the little  theatre in King Street. The house was filled to suffocation; and among  other pieces to be recited was a new poem by H. C. Andersen, called, My  Aunt's Spectacles; the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:    \"A certain person had an aunt, who boasted of particular skill in  fortune-telling with cards, and who was constantly being stormed by  persons that wanted to have a peep into futurity. But she was full of  mystery about her art, in which a certain pair of magic spectacles  did her essential service. Her nephew, a merry boy, who was his aunt's  darling, begged so long for these spectacles, that, at last, she lent  him the treasure, after having informed him, with many exhortations,  that in order to execute the interesting trick, he need only repair to  some place where a great many persons were assembled; and then, from a  higher position, whence he could overlook the crowd, pass the company in  review before him through his spectacles. Immediately 'the inner man' of  each individual would be displayed before him, like a game of cards, in  which he unerringly might read what the future of every person presented  was to be. Well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the  powers of the spectacles in the theatre; no place seeming to him more  fitted for such a trial. He begged permission of the worthy audience,  and set his spectacles on his nose. A motley phantasmagoria presents  itself before him, which he describes in a few satirical touches, yet  without expressing his opinion openly: he tells the people enough to set  them all thinking and guessing; but in order to hurt nobody, he wraps  his witty oracular judgments in a transparent veil, or rather in a lurid  thundercloud, shooting forth bright sparks of wit, that they may fall in  the powder-magazine of the expectant audience.\"    The humorous poem was admirably recited, and the speaker much applauded.  Among the audience was the young man of the hospital, who seemed to have  forgotten his adventure of the preceding night. He had on the Shoes; for  as yet no lawful owner had"]]]
