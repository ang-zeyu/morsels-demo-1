We had one man actually dying, several  others who must die before long, eight or ten who were very severely  wounded in the thigh and quite unable to move, two at least who were  paralysed, many who had not set foot out of bed and were not fit to  travel--we had not forgotten the amputation case of a few days before,  who was taken out dead at Charleroi station. I was so absolutely  miserable about it that I persuaded the Belgian doctor to go to the  commandant, and beg that the worst cases might be left to us, which he  very pluckily did, but without the slightest effect--they must all go,  ill or well, fit or unfit. After all the German patients were returning  to their own country and people, but these poor French soldiers were  going ill and wounded as prisoners to suffer and perhaps die in an  enemy's country--an enemy who knew no mercy.    I could hardly bear to go into the wards at all that day, and busied  myself with seeing about their clothes. Here was a practical  illustration of the difference in equipment between the German and  French soldiers. The German soldiers came in well equipped, with money  in their pockets and all they needed with them. Their organization was  perfect, and they were prepared for the war; the French were not. When  they arrived at the hospital their clothes had been cut off them anyhow,  with jagged rips and splits by the untrained Red Cross girls. Trained  ambulance workers are always taught to cut by the seam when possible.  Many had come without a cap, some without a great-coat, some without  boots; all had to be got ready somehow. The hospital was desperately  short of supplies--we simply could not give them all clean shirts and  drawers as we longed to do. The trousers were our worst problem, hardly  any of them were fit to put on. We had a few pairs of grey and black  striped trousers, the kind a superior shopman might wear, but we were  afraid to give those to the men as we thought the Germans would think  they were going to try to escape if they appeared in civil trousers, and  might punish them severely. So we mended up these remnants of French red  pantaloons as best we could. One man we _had_ to give civil trousers as  he had only a few shreds of pantaloon left, and these he promised to  carry in his hand to show that he really could not put them on.    The men were laughing and joking and teasing one another about their  garments, but my heart was as heavy as lead. I simply could not _bear_  to let the worst cases go. One or two of the Committee came up and we  begged them to try what they could do with the commandant, but they said  it was not the least use, and from what I had seen myself, I had to  confess that I did not think it would be. The patient I was most unhappy  about was a certain French count we had in the hospital. He had been  shot through the back at the battle of Nalinnes, and was three days on  the battlefield before he was picked up. Now he lay dying in a little  side room off the ward. The least movement caused him acute agony, even  the pillow had to be moved an inch at a time before it could be turned,  and it took half an hour to change his shirt. The doctor had said in the  morning he could not last another forty-eight hours. But if he was alive  the next morning he would be put in those horrible springless carts, and  jolted, jolted down to the station, taken out and transferred to a  shaky, vibrating train, carrying him far away into Germany.    Mercifully he died very peacefully in his sleep that evening, and we  were all very thankful that the end should have come a little earlier  than was expected.    Late that night came a message that the men were not to start till  midday, so we got them all dressed somehow by eleven. All had had bad  nights, nearly all had temperatures, and they looked very poor things  when they were dressed; even fat, jolly Adolphe looked pale and subdued.  We had not attempted to do anything with the bad bed cases; if they  _must_ go they must just go wrapped up in their blankets. But we  unexpectedly got a reprieve. A great German chief came round that  morning, accompanied by the German doctor and German commandant, and  gave the order that the very bad cases were to remain for the present. I  cannot say how thankful we were for this respite and so were the men.  Poor Jules, who was very weak from pain and high temperature, turned to  the wall and cried from pure relief.    At 11.30 the patients had their dinner--we tried to give them a good one  for the last--and then every moment we expected the wagons to come. We  waited and waited till at length we began to long for them to come and  get the misery of it over. At last they arrived, and we packed our  patients into it as comfortably as we could on the straw. Each had a  parcel with a little money and a few delicacies our ever-generous Madame  D---- had provided. It was terrible to think of some of these poor men  in their shoddy uniforms, without an overcoat, going off to face a long  German winter.    So we said good-bye with smiles and tears and thanks and salutations.  And the springless wagons jolted away over the rough road, and  fortunately we had our bad cases to occupy our thoughts. An order came  to prepare at once for some more wounded who might be coming in at any  time, so we started at once to get ready for any emergency. The beds  were disinfected and made up with our last clean sheets and  pillow-cases, and the wards scrubbed, when there was a shout from some  one that they were bringing in wounded at the hospital gate. We looked  out and true enough there were stretchers being brought in. I went along  to the operating theatre to see that all was ready there in case of  necessity, when I heard shrieks and howls of joy, and turned round and  there were all our dear men back again, and they, as well as the entire  staff, were half mad with delight. They were all so excited, talking at  once, one could hardly make out what had happened; but at last I made  one of them tell me quietly. It appeared that when the wagons got down  to Charleroi station, the men were unloaded and put on stretchers, and  were about to be carried into the station when an officer came and  pointed a pistol at them (why, no one knew, for they were only obeying  orders), and said they were to wait. So they waited there outside the  station for a long time, guarded by a squad of German soldiers, and at  last were told that the train to Germany was already full and that they  must return to the hospital. They all had to be got back into bed (into  our disinfected beds, with the last of the clean sheets!) and fed and  their dressings done, and so on, and they were so excited that it took a  long time before they could settle down for the night. But it was a very  short reprieve, for the next day they had to go off again and there was  no coming back this time.    I often think of those poor lads in Germany and wonder what has become  of them, and if those far-off mothers all think their sons are dead. If  so, what a joyful surprise some of them will have some day--after the  war.          IV    THE RETURN TO BRUSSELS      This seemed a favourable moment for me to go to Brussels for a day or  two to visit my flock. The Committee gave me leave to go, but begged me  to be back in two days, which I promised to do. A _laissez-passer_ had  been obtained from the German commandant for a Red Cross automobile to  go into Brussels to fetch some supplies of dressings and bandages of  which all the hospitals in the neighbourhood were woefully short. And I  was also graciously accorded a ticket of leave by the same august  authority to go for two days, which might be extended to three according  to the length of stay of the automobile.    The night before I left, an aeroplane which had been flying very high  above the town dropped some papers. The doctor with whom I was lodging  secured one and brought it back triumphantly. It contained a message  from the Burgomaster of Antwerp to his fellow-citizens, and ended thus:  \"Courage, fellow-citizens, in a fortnight our country will be delivered  from the enemy.\"    We were all absurdly cheered by this message, and felt that it was only  a matter of a short time now before the Germans were driven out of  Belgium. We had had no news for so long that we thought probably the  Antwerp Burgomaster had information of which we knew nothing, and I was  looking forward to hearing some good news when I got to Brussels.    I found Brussels very much changed since I had left it some weeks  before. Then it was in a fever of excitement, now it was in the chill of  dark despair. German rule was firmly established, and was growing daily  more harsh and humiliating for its citizens. Everything was done to  Germanize the city, military automobiles were always dashing through,  their hooters playing the notes of the Emperor's salute, Belgian  automobiles that had been requisitioned whirred up and down the streets  filled with German officers' wives and children, German time was kept,  German money was current coin, and every cafe and confectioner's shop  was always crowded with German soldiers. Every day something new was  forbidden. Now it was taking photographs--the next day no cyclist was  allowed to ride, and any cyclist in civil dress might be shot at sight,  and so on. The people were only _just_ kept in hand by their splendid  Burgomaster, M. Max, but more than once it was just touch and go whether  he would be able to restrain them any longer.    What made the people almost more angry than anything else was the loss  of their pigeons, as many of the Belgians are great pigeon fanciers and  have very valuable birds. Another critical moment was when they were  ordered to take down all the Belgian flags. Up to that time the Belgian  flag, unlike every other town that the Germans had occupied, had floated  bravely from nearly every house in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#6)"],[1,"thought.    Your language may be most pure, perfect, full of meaning, but you cannot  make yourself understood till your hearers can look thro your signs to  the things signified. You may as well present before them a picture of  _nothing_.    The great fault in the popular system of education is easily accounted  for, particularly in reference to language. Children are taught to study  signs without looking at the thing signified. In this way they are mere  copyists, and the mind can never expand so as to make them independent,  original thinkers. In fact, they can, in this way, never learn to reason  well or employ language correctly; no more than a painter can be  successful in his art, by merely looking at the pictures of others  without having ever seen the originals. A good artist is a close  observer of nature. So children should be left free to examine and  reflect, and the signs will then serve their proper use--the means of  acquiring the knowledge of things. In vain you may give a scholar a  knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, or Latin, learn him to translate with  rapidity or speak our own language fluently. If he has not thereby  learned the knowledge of things signified by such language, he is, in  principle, advanced no farther than the parrot which says \"pretty poll,  pretty poll.\"    I am happy, however, in the consideration that a valuable change is  taking place in this respect. Geography is no longer taught on the old  systems, but maps are given to represent more vividly land and water,  rivers, islands, and mountains. The study of arithmetic, chemistry, and  nearly all the sciences have been materially improved within a few  years. Grammar alone remains in quiet possession of its unquestioned  authority. Its nine \"parts of speech,\" its three genders, its three  cases, its half dozen kinds of pronouns, and as many moods and tenses,  have rarely been disquieted. A host of book makers have fondled around  them, but few have dared molest them, finding them so snugly ensconced  under the sanctity of age, and the venerated opinions of learned and  good men. Of the numberless attempts to simplify grammar, what has been  the success? Wherein do modern \"simplifiers\" differ from Murray? and he  was only a _compiler_! They have all discovered his errors. But who has  corrected them? They have all deviated somewhat from his manner. But  what is that but saying, that with all his grammatical knowledge, he  could not explain his own meaning?    All the trouble originates in this; the rules of grammar have not been  sought for where they are only to be found, in the laws that govern  matter and thought. Arbitrary rules have been adopted which will never  apply in practice, except in special cases, and the attempt to bind  language down to them is as absurd as to undertake to chain thought, or  stop the waters of Niagara with a straw. Language will go on, and keep  pace with the mind, and grammar should explain it so as to be correctly  understood.    I wish you to keep these principles distinctly in view all thro my  remarks, that you may challenge every position I assume till proved to  be correct--till you distinctly understand it and definite impressions  are made upon your minds. In this way you will discover a beauty and  perfection in language before unknown; its rules will be found few and  simple, holding with most unyielding tenacity to the sublime principles  upon which they depend; and you will have reason to admire the works and  adore the character of the great Parent Intellect, whose presence and  protection pervade all his works and regulate the laws of matter and  mind. You will feel yourselves involuntarily filled with sentiments of  gratitude for the gift of mind, its affections, powers, and means of  operation and communication, and resolved more than ever to employ these  faculties in human improvement and the advancement of general happiness.          LECTURE III.    WRITTEN AND SPOKEN LANGUAGE.        Principles never alter.--They should be known.--Grammar a most      important branch of science.--Spoken and written Language.--Idea      of a thing.--How expressed.--An example.--Picture writing.--An      anecdote.--Ideas expressed by actions.--Principles of spoken and      written Language.--Apply universally.--Two examples.--English      language.--Foreign words.--Words in science.--New words.--How      formed.      We now come to take a nearer view of language as generally understood by  grammar. But we shall have no occasion to depart from the principles  already advanced, for there is existing in practice nothing which may  not be accounted for in theory; as there can be no effect without an  efficient cause to produce it.    We may, however, long remain ignorant of the true explanation of the  principles involved; but the fault is ours, and not in the things  themselves. The earth moved with as much grandeur and precision around  its axis and in its orbit before the days of Gallileo Gallilei, when  philosophers believed it flat and stationary, as it has done since. So  the great principles on which depends the existence and use of all  language are permanent, and may be correctly employed by those who have  never examined them; but this does not prove that to be ignorant is  better than to be wise. We may have taken food all our days without  knowing much of the process by which it is converted into nourishment  and incorporated into our bodies, without ever having heard of  delutition chymification, chylification, or even digestion, as a whole;  but this is far from convincing me that the knowledge of these things is  unimportant, or that ignorance of them is not the cause of much disease  and suffering among mankind. And it is, or should be, the business of  the physiologist to explain these things, and show the great practical  benefit resulting from a general knowledge of them. So the grammarian  should act as a sort of physiologist of language. He should analyze all  its parts and show how it is framed together to constitute a perfect  whole.    Instead of exacting of you a blind submission to a set of technical  expressions, and arbitrary rules, I most urgently exhort you to  continue, with unremitting assiduity, your inquiries into the reason and  propriety of the positions which may be taken. It is the business of  philosophy, not to meddle with things to direct how they should be, but  to account for them and their properties and relations as they are. So  it is the business of grammar to explain language as it exists in use,  and exhibit the reason why it is used thus, and what principles must be  observed to employ it correctly in speaking and writing. This method is  adopted to carry out the principles already established, and show their  adaptation to the wants of the community, and how they may be correctly  and successfully employed. Grammar considered in this light forms a  department in the science of the mind by no means unimportant. And it  can not fail to be deeply interesting to all who would employ it in the  business, social, literary, moral, or religious concerns of life. Those  who have thoughts to communicate, or desire an acquaintance with the  minds of others, can not be indifferent to the means on which such  intercourse depends. I am convinced, therefore, that you will give me  your most profound attention as I pursue the subject of the present  lecture somewhat in detail. And I hope you will not consider me tedious  or unnecessarily prolix in my remarks.    I will not be particular in my remarks upon the changes of spoken and  written language, altho that topic of itself, in the different sounds  and signs employed in different ages and by different nations to express  the same idea, would form a most interesting theme for several lectures.  But that work must be reserved for a future occasion. You are all  acquainted with the signs, written and spoken, which are employed in our  language as vehicles (some of them like omnibusses) of thought to carry  ideas from one mind to another. Some of you doubtless are acquainted  with the application of this fact in other languages. In other words,  you know how to sound the name of a thing, how to describe its  properties as far as you understand them, and its attitudes or changes.  This you can do by vocal sounds, or written, or printed signs.    On the other hand, you can receive a similar impression by hearing the  description of another, or by seeing it written or printed. But here you  will bear in mind the fact that the word, spoken or written, is but the  sign of the idea derived from the thing signified. For example: Here is  an apple. I do not now speak of its composition, the skin, the pulp,  &c.; nor of its qualities, whether sour, or sweet, or bitter, good or  bad, great or small, long or short, round or flat, red, or white, or  yellow. I speak of a single thing--an apple. Here it is, present before  you. Look at it. It is now removed. You do not see it. Your minds are  occupied with something else, in looking at that organ, or this  representation of Solomon's temple, or, perhaps, lingering in melancholy  review of your old systems of grammar thro which you plodded at a  tedious rate, goaded on by the stimulus of the ferule, or the fear of  being called ignorant. From that unhappy reverie I recal your minds, by  saying _apple_. An apple? where? There is none in sight. No; but you  have distinct recollections of a single object I just now held before  you. You see it, mentally, and were you painters you might paint its  likeness. What has brought this object so vividly before you? The single  sound _apple_. This sound has called up the idea produced in your mind  on looking at this object which I now again present before you. Here is  the thing represented--the apple. Again I lay it aside, and commence a  conversation with you on the varieties of apples, the form, color,  flavor, manner of"]]]
