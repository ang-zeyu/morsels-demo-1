Perception, for instance, is looked upon as the capacity for thinking of  a thing immediately at hand, and memory as a capacity for thinking again  of a certain material or abstract object. The mental power of  abstraction is no longer considered as a sort of separate function of  the mind but is regarded as the capacity for thinking of, say, whiteness  as apart from any particular white patch. But the notion that the white  man is endowed with a set of finer feelings and with special and higher  powers of abstraction than is the African Native is so generally  entertained that it will be convenient to make the necessary comparisons  in, more or less, the commonly accepted terms.    Those who look upon the Native as being in every way a more primitive  being than the European will naturally be disposed to believe that he is  more a creature of instincts than a man of reason, and they will expect  him to move in dependence upon certain fundamental intuitions where the  European goes guided by reason alone. I have found no evidence whatever  to support this supposition.    The elementry instinct of self-preservation is no stronger in the Native  than in the white man. Suicide is not at all uncommon among the Bantu. I  have seen many instances of Natives who have shown a calm and  philosophical disregard of death where life has seemed no longer  desirable. This pre-eminently human prerogative--for no animal can rise  to the conscious and deliberate destruction of itself--has often been  exercised, as I have seen, by Natives in their sound and sober senses so  as to preclude entirely that suggestion of temporary insanity which is  so commonly accepted at coroner's inquests in England and elsewhere.    The instinct of direction, the \"bump of locality\" as it is generally  called, varies with the Natives as it does among the whites, and is no  keener in the individual Native than in the individual white man. All  the hunters and travellers I have met have confirmed the opinion I have  myself formed from personal experience that by training his ordinary  powers of observation and thereby developing his sense of locality and  direction the average European is able, after a comparatively short  time, to find his way in difficult country as well as the Natives, while  some European hunters who have dispensed with Native guides and trackers  have acquired the art of tracking game so well that they surpass even  the local Natives themselves. \"Veld-craft\" is simply a matter of  training the ordinary faculties of observation and memory for particular  purposes, and the Native shows no such superiority in this respect as  would naturally be expected from him if he were indeed better provided  with animal instincts than the more civilised white man.    The sexual instincts of the Natives seem in no wise different from those  of other people. The African male, like the European male, is generally  more amative than the female who is always more philoprogenitive than  the man. But the notion is common that the Native male is more bestial  when sexually excited than the white man in similar case, and this is  taken to account for the fact that he is so often found guilty of crimes  of violence against females of his own colour, and sometimes even  against European women.    It must be borne in mind that before the white man came the Natives,  like the peasants in many European countries not long ago, conducted  their courtship and love-making with a show of violence which seemed to  them right and proper. The idea, indeed, that any self-respecting Native  girl could yield herself to a lover without, at least, a semblance of  physical resistance, leading to her more or less forcible capture by the  man, would have seemed, and still seems, distinctly improper to the  majority of Native women in their raw state. But since the European code  was set up Native women have not been slow in making use of its  protection, and, as I have seen, have not infrequently abused that  protection by alleging rape or assault where their own action in  simulating flight and resistance served, as they well knew it would, to  stimulate passion and pursuit.    In considering crimes of violence against white women it must also be  remembered that the Native \"house-boy\" who works in constant and close  physical contact with his European mistress and her daughters is exposed  to sexual excitation which very few European youths are called upon to  withstand. But crimes of this kind are indeed common enough among the  lower orders in Europe and America, and are particularly frequent among  men who have to live for a long time in unnatural abstinence from  natural intercourse with the opposite sex, and who then find themselves  in new surroundings giving opportunities for the gratification of their  natural desires, but without having at the same time the restraining  influences of their home life to help them to overcome the temptations  to which they are exposed. The seaports of Europe and America, and the  Great War furnish too many sad examples of sexual ferocity by white men  to allow us to think that they are in this respect inherently superior  to the men of other races.    The maternal instinct is manifested in the same manner and degree in the  women of both people. I have often asked Native women whether it would  be possible for any mother among them to distinguish her own new-born  baby from a supposed \"changeling\" of the same sex and of the same  general appearance, and the answer has always been negative. The Native  and the white woman alike would continue to cherish the substituted  child exactly as they would have cherished the issue of their own  bodies. The desire to bear children is the same in all normally  constituted women irrespective of colour or race, and there is no sign  of any special instinct for identification in the Native woman, such as  the sense of smell, which is found in all the higher animals.    There are some students who think that most of the emotions of man are  but the survivals of instinctive habit. Be this as it may, the sexual  attraction which is commonly called love certainly seems to be  essentially instinctive whereas friendship and parental and filial  devotion, when continued throughout life, seem to be emotions that  depend largely upon association and conscious intelligence. Every  natural mother will sacrifice herself for her offspring while it is  young but the tender feeling which continues in her breast towards the  child after it has grown up is sustained by association, or, where the  child is continually absent, by conscious intelligence in the form of  considerations of conventional approbation which in time merge into a  habit or a sense of duty which is hardly recognised as such. Many white  people think that although the average Native mother is capable of the  greatest devotion for her young children she is incapable of the love  which a white mother feels for her children even after they have ceased  to depend upon her care. This, I think, is wrong. I have seen many  instances of elderly Native women who have cherished their grown up  children to the last with every sign of motherly affection.    Joy and sorrow, love and hatred, hope and fear, these are the  fundamental emotions of human kind. Can any difference be detected  between these feelings in the two races?    No one who knows him will say that the Native's capacity for the \"joy of  life unquestioned\" is less than that of the average white man. Most  Natives are born lovers of song and music, and attain easily to  technical proficiency in the art of harmony. The aesthetic sense is  present in the average Native as it is in the average European and in  both is easily overlooked when not stimulated and developed by education  and culture. That the Natives, as a whole, feel the sorrows of life and  death as keenly as do the people of other races will be readily admitted  by all who know them well, although their way of showing their sorrow  may differ from those prescribed by the canons of conduct of other  communities. It is assumed by many that love, \"the grand passion,\" has  been brought to a finer point, as it were, among the white people than  anywhere else, and it may well be that monogamy is conducive to the  growth of a higher and purer form of sexual reciprocity than is possible  under the polygamous system of the Natives and other peoples. The  monogamous marriage, though based on sexual attraction in the first  instance, tends to become, as the man and the woman grow older, a union  of souls, so to speak, more or less independent of the sexual element  itself. The close and continued association of one man and one woman of  compatible temperaments no doubt brings about a state of mutual  intimacy, dependence and devotion which can hardly be possible in a  polygamous household. But on the other hand may fairly be cited the  frequent instances, familiar to all, of widows and widowers among  Europeans who, despite their repeated and quite honest protestations of  undying and undivided love for the first \"one and only\" mate,  nevertheless find speedy consolation in a second marriage in which  undying and whole-hearted love for the second \"one and only\" spouse is  again declared and accepted in all sincerity. The phenomenon of \"falling  in love,\" as it is commonly called, is not peculiar to white people. I  have known many cases where the love-sick Native swain has travelled  hundreds of miles and suffered great hardships in order to reach or  recover the one woman of his choice though other women, no less  desirable, were ready to be had for the asking at his home. The converse  is even more commonly seen. Native women are remarkably like white  women. They look upon marriage as their proper and natural function in  life, but they are not all of them willing to marry according to  parental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],[0,"Elsie's New Relations (#6)"],[1,"was seldom anything more severe than the gentle rebuke, 'I  am not pleased with you,' but I think I felt it more than many a child  would a whipping; I did so dearly love my father that his displeasure was  terrible to me.\"    \"Yes, I know you and he love each other dearly yet, and he often says you  were a very good, conscientious little girl.\"    \"But to return to Lulu,\" said Mrs. Travilla, \"I had thought she would be a  nice companion for you, and until this evening I have not seen her show  any naughty temper since the first week she was here.\"    \"No, mamma, she has been quite well-behaved, I believe, and perhaps she  will prove a pleasant companion. I am sorry for her, too, because she  hasn't a dear, wise, kind mother like mine,\" Rosie added, putting her  arms about her mother's neck, \"and because the father, I am sure she loves  very much, must soon go away and leave her.\"          CHAPTER V.        \"Farewell, God knows when we shall meet again.\"                                --Shakespeare.      The next morning the captain and Max were out together on the beach before  Violet and the little girls had left their rooms. The lad liked to be  alone with his father sometimes. He had always been proud and fond of him,  and the past few months of constant intercourse had greatly strengthened  the bonds of affection between them. The boy's heart was sore at thought  of the parting that must soon come, the captain's hardly less so. He  talked very kindly with his son, urging him to make the best use of his  time, talents and opportunities, and grow up to be a good, honorable and  useful man.    \"I want to be just such a man as you are, papa,\" Max said, with an  admiring, affectionate look up into his father's face, and slipping his  hand into his as he spoke.    The captain clasped the hand lovingly in his, and held it fast.    \"I hope you will be a better and more talented man, my boy,\" he said,  \"but always remember my most ardent wish is to see you a truly good man, a  Christian, serving God with all your powers.\"    At this moment a voice behind them said, \"Good-mornin', cap'n. I'se got a  lettah hyah for you, sah.\"    \"Ah, good-morning, Ben, and thank you for bringing it,\" said the captain,  turning round to receive it.    \"You's bery welcom, sah,\" responded Ben, touching his hat respectfully,  then walking away toward Mr. Dinsmore's cottage.    \"From Washington,\" the captain remarked, more to himself than to Max, as  he broke the seal.    Max watched him while he read, then asked, a little tremulously, \"Must you  go very soon, papa?\"    \"Within three days, my boy. But we won't say anything about it until after  prayers, but let Mamma Vi and your sisters enjoy their breakfast in  peace.\"    \"Yes, sir. Papa, I wish I was going with you!\"    \"But think how your sisters would miss you, Max.\"    \"Yes, sir, I suppose they would. I hadn't thought of that.\"    \"Besides, I want you to take my place to Mamma Vi as nearly as you can,\"  added his father, looking smilingly at him.    \"O papa, thank you!\" cried the boy, his face growing bright with pleased  surprise. \"I will try my very best and do all for her that I can.\"    \"I don't doubt it, my son. And now let us go in, for it must be  breakfast-time, I think.\"    Lulu and Grace ran out to the veranda to meet them with a glad,  \"Good-morning, papa,\" and holding up their faces for a kiss.    It was bestowed heartily, as he stooped and gathered them in his arms,  saying in tender tones, \"Good-morning, my dear little daughters.\"    The breakfast bell was ringing, and they hastened to obey its summons.  They found Violet already in the dining-room, and looking sweet and fresh  as a rose, in a pretty, becoming morning dress.    The captain chatted cheerfully with her and the children while he ate,  seeming to enjoy his beefsteak, muffins and coffee; but Max scarcely  spoke, and occasionally had some difficulty in swallowing his food because  of the lump that would rise in his throat at the thought of the parting  now drawing so near.    Directly after breakfast came family worship. Then as Violet and her  husband stood together before the window looking out upon the sea, he  gave her his Washington letter to read.    She glanced over it, while he put his arm about her waist.    \"O Levis, so soon!\" she said tremulously, looking up at him with eyes full  of tears, then her head dropped upon his shoulder, and the tears began to  fall.    He soothed her with caresses and low-breathed words of endearment; of  hope, too, that the separation might not be a long one.    \"What is it, Max?\" whispered Lulu, \"has papa got his orders?\"    \"Yes; and has to be off in less than three days,\" replied Max, in husky  tones, and hastily brushing away a tear.    Lulu's eyes filled, but by a great effort she kept the tears from falling.    The captain turned toward them. \"We are going into the other house,  children,\" he said. \"You can come with us if you wish.\"    \"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,\" they said, and Grace ran to her father and put  her hand in his.    They found the Dinsmore and Travilla family all assembled in the parlor,  discussing plans for the day, all of which were upset by the captain's  news.    His ship lay in Boston harbor, and it was promptly decided that they would  all leave to-day for that city, only a few hours' distant.    As the cottages had been rented furnished, and all had for days past held  themselves in readiness for sudden departure, this would afford ample time  for the necessary packing and other arrangements.    All was presently bustle and activity in both houses. Zoe and Edward, with  no painful parting in prospect, made themselves very merry over their  packing. They were much like two children, and except when overcome by the  recollection of her recent bereavement, Zoe was as playful and frolicsome  as a kitten.    \"Can I help, Mamma Vi?\" asked Lulu, following Violet into her  dressing-room.    Vi considered a moment. \"You are a dear child to want to help,\" she said,  smiling kindly upon the little girl. \"I don't think you can pack your  trunk, but you can be of use here by handing me things out of the bureau  drawers and wardrobe. There are so many trunks to pack that I cannot think  of leaving Agnes to do it all.\"    \"My dear,\" said the captain, coming in at that moment, \"you are not to do  anything but sit in that easy-chair and give directions. I flatter myself  that I am quite an expert in this line.\"    \"Can you fold ladies' dresses so that they will carry without rumpling?\"  asked Violet, looking up at him with a saucy smile.    \"Perhaps not. I can't say I ever tried that. Agnes may do that part of the  work, and I will attend to the rest.\"    \"And may I hand you the things, papa?\" asked Lulu.    \"Yes, daughter,\" he said, \"I like to see you trying to be useful.\"    They set to work, Violet looking on with interest. \"Why, you are an  excellent packer, Levis,\" she remarked presently, \"far better than I or  Agnes either.\"    \"Thank you,\" he said, \"I am very glad to be able to save you the  exertion.\"    \"And you do it so rapidly,\" she said. \"It would have taken me twice as  long.\"    \"That is partly because I am much stronger, and partly the result of a  good deal of practice. And Lulu is quite a help,\" he added, with an  affectionate look at her.    She flushed with pleasure. \"Are you going to pack the other trunks, papa?  Max's and Grade's and mine? And may I help you with them?\" she asked.    \"Yes, is my answer to both questions,\" he returned.    \"Where are Max and Gracie?\" asked Violet.    \"I told Max to take his little sister to the beach, and take care of and  amuse her,\" the captain said in answer to the question.    \"Don't you want to be out at play, too, Lulu?\" asked Violet. \"I can help  your papa.\"    \"No, ma'am, thank you,\" the child answered in a quick, emphatic way. \"I'd  a great deal rather be with papa to-day than playing.\"    He gave her a pleased look and smile, and Violet said, \"That is nice,  Lulu; I am very glad his children love him so.\"    \"Indeed we do, Mamma Vi! every one of us!\" exclaimed Lulu. \"Papa knows we  do. Don't you, papa?\"    \"Yes, I am quite sure of it,\" he said. \"And that my wife is fond of me  also,\" with a smiling glance at her, \"and altogether it makes me a very  happy man.\"    \"As you deserve to be,\" said Violet, gayly. \"Please, sir, will you allow  me to fold my dresses?\"    \"No, for here comes Agnes,\" as the maid entered the room, \"who, I dare  say, can do it better. Come, Lulu, we will go now to your room.\"    Violet stayed where she was to direct and assist Agnes, and Lulu was glad,  because she wanted to be alone with her father for a while.    When her trunk was packed he turned to leave the room, but she detained  him. \"Papa,\" she said, clinging to his hand, \"I--I want to speak to you.\"    He sat down and drew her to his side, putting an arm about her waist.  \"Well, daughter, what is it?\" he asked kindly, stroking the hair back from  her forehead with the other hand.    \"Papa, I--I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry for----\" she stammered, her  eyes drooping, her cheeks growing crimson.    \"Sorry for your former naughtiness and rebellion?\" he asked gently, as she  paused, leaving her sentence unfinished.    \"Yes, papa, I couldn't bear to let you go away without telling you so  again.\"    \"Well, daughter, it was all forgiven long ago, and you have been a pretty  good girl most of the time since that first sad week.\"    \"Papa, I do want to be good,\" she said earnestly, \"but somehow the badness  will get the better of me.\"    \"Yes; each one of us has an evil nature to fight against,\" he said, \"and  it will get the better of us unless we are very determined and battle with  it, not in our own strength only, but crying mightily for assistance to  Him who has said, 'In me is thine help.'    \"We must watch and pray, my child.
