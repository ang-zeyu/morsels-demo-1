As was becoming for a spiritual barrier there was  nothing to mark it except the boundary stones through which the  imaginary line passed. The wall, which Servius built and which continued  to be the outer wall of Rome for a period of eight or nine hundred years  until the third Christian century, was at the time of its building  coincident in the main with the line of the _pomerium_, with one very  important exception: namely that all the region of the Aventine, which  was inside the limits of the political city and embraced by the Servian  wall, lay outside the _pomerium_ line and was in other words outside the  religious city. It continued thus all through the republic and into the  empire until the reign of Claudius. Originally the _pomerium_ line  played an important part in the religious world and it continued to do  so until the middle of the republic, during the Second Punic War, when  its sanctity was destroyed and it lost its real religious significance,  though it remained as a formal institution. As a divine barrier it  served originally in the world of the gods very much the same purpose as  the material wall of stone did in the world of men. Before the problem  of foreign gods had begun to exist for the Romans, in the good old days  when they knew only the gods of their own religion, the _pomerium_  served to keep within the bounds of Rome all the beneficent kindly gods  whose presence was not needed outside in the fields, and it served fully  as important a purpose in keeping outside of Rome the gods who were  feared rather than loved, for example the dread war-god Mars. When  foreign gods began to be introduced into Rome they might, of course, be  worshipped inside the _pomerium_ by private individuals, but when the  state acknowledged them it was more prudent that her worship should be  outside the sacred wall. Thus it came to pass that the foreign gods, who  were taken into the cult of the Roman state, were given temples in the  Campus Martius or over on the Aventine, and the two or three cases where  they were publicly worshipped inside the _pomerium_ form no real  exception to this rule--such an exception would be, in fact, quite  unthinkable in the strictly logical system of Roman worship--but these  gods were allowed inside because they came to Rome from her kinsfolk,  the Latins, and were not felt to be foreign.    Hercules is one of the cases in this last category. Though originally,  as we have seen, a Greek god, his long residence in Tibur (Tivoli) had  made him, as it were, a naturalised citizen of Latium, and hence Rome  felt it no impropriety to take him inside her _pomerium_. At first his  worship seems to have been carried on by two clans, the Potitii and the  Pinarii, but later, during the republic, the state assumed control. But  though it was really the Greek Herakles who had come in as the latinised  Hercules, the god had paid a certain price for his admission, for he  came stripped of all the various attributes which he had had in Greece  and retaining merely his function as patron of trade and travel. It was  this practical side of his nature alone which appealed to the Romans; it  found its expression in the offering of \"the tenth\" at the great altar  in the Forum Boarium. This altar always remained in a certain sense the  centre of Hercules-worship in Rome. It was reinforced at an early date  by no less than three temples of Hercules in the more or less immediate  neighbourhood, all of which were characterised by the same relative  simplicity of ritual. Centuries later Herakles became known to the  Romans through direct Greek channels, and it was recognised that this  new Herakles was akin to the old Hercules, so that he too was called  Hercules. There was nothing surprising in this to the Romans, because  they considered it a matter of course that there should be found a  parallel among their own gods for each Greek deity. They never  understood the true state of affairs; it is doubtful whether they could  have understood it: namely, that in almost all their other  identifications of Roman and Greek deities, they were really doing  violence to their own native gods by superimposing upon them the  attributes of a deity with whom they had really nothing in common,  whereas, in identifying the new Herakles with their old Hercules, they  were doing a perfectly legitimate thing. For one who knows the true  state of affairs there is something pathetically amusing in the fact  that they really showed more delicacy in making their old (really  originally Greek) Hercules into the new Greek Herakles-Hercules, than  they did in throwing together Neptune and Poseidon, Mars and Ares, Diana  and Artemis. As a matter of fact they always reverenced the old cult of  the great altar, and never allowed the more sensational phases of Greek  worship to be practised there, and put off into another quarter the  temples which were built to Hercules under the various new attributes  which the new Greek cult brought with it. These temples were placed, as  was proper, outside the _pomerium_, in the southern part of the Campus  Martius.    But to return to the simple Hercules and the Servian regime, the Roman  state had now obtained a deity, of which, by the contagion of commerce,  they already felt a need, a god of great power from whom came success in  the practical undertakings of life. Hence he had a strong hold on the  Romans whose practical side was undergoing a rapid development. The idea  of trade was now represented in the religious world, it had received its  divine sanction.    The other god, who came up from Magna Graecia and whose formal  acceptance into the state-cult formed one of the earliest incidents in  the breakdown of the old agricultural religion, was Castor, with his  twin-brother Pollux, although brother Pollux was always an insignificant  partner, so much so that the temple which was subsequently built to them  both was referred to either as the temple of \"Castor\" alone or as the  temple of \"the Castors.\" At various points in the old Greek world we  meet with a pair of brothers, at first not designated by individual  names but merely named as a pair. Even these pair-names do not agree,  but they represent all of them the same idea. Later when individual  names are substituted for the general pair-name, these individual names  also differ. They are gods of protection, and on the sea-coast--and most  of Greece is sea-coast--they are especially helpful as rescuers from the  dangers of the sea, and they are also very early and almost everywhere  connected with horses. But in spite of their usefulness they are not  very prominent, and it is doubtful whether they would ever have become  famous, except for one of those little accidents which make the fortunes  of gods as well as of men. It so happened that horses began to be used  in warfare more than for the mere drawing of chariots; a primitive sort  of cavalry came into being, produced by mounting heavy-armed  foot-soldiers on horseback. With this cavalry the \"Twin-Brothers\"  (_Dios-kouroi_ = \"Sons of Zeus\"), especially Castor, became prominent.  Just as the Greek merchants had taken Herakles with them when they set  out to plant colonies in Southern Italy, so the heavy-mounted horsemen  carried their god Castor with them wherever they went. The Italic tribes  in their turn were quick to seize upon this idea of cavalry, and with  it as an essential part went its divine patron, Castor. Thus the  Castor-cult moved steadily northward, carried, as it were, on horseback.  At last it reached Latium, and there the little town of Tusculum,  afterwards so famous as the residence of Cicero, became in some  unaccountable way an important cult-centre, and did for Castor what  Tibur had done for Hercules, _i.e._ latinised him, so that Rome received  him not as an alien but as one of her kin. There can be little doubt  that the Roman cult actually did come from Tusculum, and that in its  introduction into Rome, as in every other step on its march, it was  connected with the reorganisation of the cavalry. This would seem to  imply that Tusculum was famous for its cavalry and that Rome took the  idea of it from her--statements for which we have unfortunately no other  confirmation, though we have abundant proof of the cult at Tusculum and  of Rome's close association with it.    Castor was thus the patron of the \"horsemen\" (_equites_) and his great  day was July 15, when the horsemen's parade took place. Possibly this  had been the date of the festival at Tusculum, a day especially  appropriate because it was the Ides of the month, and the Ides were  sacred to Juppiter, whose sons Castor and Pollux (_Dios-kouroi_) were  supposed to be. It is extremely interesting in the light of this  knowledge of the true state of affairs to see how legend later  explained the coming of Castor and Pollux. It was an incident in the  mythical war which was supposed to have taken place after the last  Tarquin had been driven out, and the republic had been started. The  adversaries of Rome, allied with Tarquin, notably Octavius Mamilius of  Tusculum, fought against the Romans in the battle of Lake Regillus on  July 15, B.C. 499. The Romans won, and the first news of victory was  brought to Rome by the miraculous appearance of Castor and Pollux who  were seen watering their horses in the Forum at the spring of Juturna. A  temple on this spot was then vowed and fifteen years later, B.C. 484, it  was completed and dedicated. Tusculum, July 15, and the dedication of  the temple in B.C. 484 are seemingly the only historical facts in this  legend; and long before B.C. 499 Castor was worshipped in Rome,  especially on July 15. The site of his original worship was without  doubt the same locality in the Forum where his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18223"],[0,"The Essence of Buddhism (#6)"],[1,"speech, gentle and not  proud.--Metta-sutta.
