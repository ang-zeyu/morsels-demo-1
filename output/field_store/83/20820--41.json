[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#6)"],[1,"  the different modes of interpretation which have been applied to the  Sutras. The line of investigation is an entirely new one, and for the  present nothing can be taken for granted or known.--In stating the  different heads of discussion (the so-called adhikara/n/as), each of  which comprises one or more Sutras, I shall follow the subdivision into  adhikara/n/as adopted in the Vyasadhika-ra/n/amala, the text of which is  printed in the second volume of the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the  Sutras.      FIRST ADHYAYA.  PADA I.      The first five adhikara/n/as lay down the fundamental positions with  regard to Brahman. Adhik. I (1) [2] treats of what the study of the  Vedanta presupposes. Adhik. II (2) defines Brahman as that whence the  world originates, and so on. Adhik. III (3) declares that Brahman is the  source of the Veda. Adhik. IV (4) proves Brahman to be the uniform topic  of all Vedanta-texts. Adhik. V (5-11) is engaged in proving by various  arguments that the Brahman, which the Vedanta-texts represent as the  cause of the world, is an intelligent principle, and cannot be  identified with the non-intelligent pradhana from which the world  springs according to the Sa@nkhyas.    With the next adhikara/n/a there begins a series of discussions of  essentially similar character, extending up to the end of the first  adhyaya. The question is throughout whether certain terms met with in  the Upanishads denote Brahman or some other being, in most cases the  jiva, the individual soul. /S/a@nkara remarks at the outset that, as the  preceding ten Sutras had settled the all-important point that all the  Vedanta-texts refer to Brahman, the question now arises why the enquiry  should be continued any further, and thereupon proceeds to explain that  the acknowledged distinction of a higher Brahman devoid of all qualities  and a lower Brahman characterised by qualities necessitates an  investigation whether certain Vedic texts of prima facie doubtful import  set forth the lower Brahman as the object of devout meditation, or the  higher Brahman as the object of true knowledge. But that such an  investigation is actually carried on in the remaining portion of the  first adhyaya, appears neither from the wording of the Sutras nor even  from /S/a@nkara's own treatment of the Vedic texts referred to in the  Sutras. In I, 1, 20, for instance, the question is raised whether the  golden man within the sphere of the sun, with golden hair and beard and  lotus-coloured eyes--of whom the Chandogya Upanishad speaks in 1, 6,  6--is an individual soul abiding within the sun or the highest Lord.  /S/a@nkara's answer is that the passage refers to the Lord, who, for the  gratification of his worshippers, manifests himself in a bodily shape  made of Maya. So that according to /S/a@nkara himself the alternative  lies between the sagu/n/a Brahman and some particular individual soul,  not between the sagu/n/a Brahman and the nirgu/n/a Brahman.    Adhik. VI (12-19) raises the question whether the anandamaya, mentioned  in Taittiriya Upanishad II, 5, is merely a transmigrating individual  soul or the highest Self. /S/a@nkara begins by explaining the Sutras on  the latter supposition--and the text of the Sutras is certainly in  favour of that interpretation--gives, however, finally the preference to  a different and exceedingly forced explanation according to which the  Sutras teach that the anandamaya is not Brahman, since the Upanishad  expressly says that Brahman is the tail or support of the  anandamaya[3].--Ramanuja's interpretation of Adhikara/n/a VI, although  not agreeing in all particulars with the former explanation of  /S/a@nkara, yet is at one with it in the chief point, viz. that the  anandamaya is Brahman. It further deserves notice that, while /S/a@nkara  looks on Adhik. VI as the first of a series of interpretatory  discussions, all of which treat the question whether certain Vedic  passages refer to Brahman or not, Ramanuja separates the adhikara/n/a  from the subsequent part of the pada and connects it with what had  preceded. In Adhik. V it had been shown that Brahman cannot be  identified with the pradhana; Adhik. VI shows that it is different from  the individual soul, and the proof of the fundamental position of the  system is thereby completed[4].--Adhik. VII (20, 21) demonstrates that  the golden person seen within the sun and the person seen within the  eye, mentioned in Ch. Up. I, 6, are not some individual soul of high  eminence, but the supreme Brahman.--Adhik. VIII (22) teaches that by the  ether from which, according to Ch. Up. I, 9, all beings originate, not  the elemental ether has to be understood but the highest  Brahman.--Adhik. IX (23). The pra/n/a also mentioned in Ch. Up. I, ii, 5  denotes the highest Brahman[5]--Adhik. X (24-27) teaches that the light  spoken of in Ch. Up. III, 13, 7 is not the ordinary physical light but  the highest Brahman[6].--Adhik. XI (28-31) decides that the pra/n/a  mentioned in Kau. Up. III, 2 is Brahman.      PADA II.      Adhik. I (1-8) shows that the being which consists of mind, whose body  is breath, &c., mentioned in Ch. Up. III, 14, is not the individual  soul, but Brahman. The Sutras of this adhikara/n/a emphatically dwell on  the difference of the individual soul and the highest Self, whence  /S/a@nkara is obliged to add an explanation--in his comment on Sutra  6--to the effect that that difference is to be understood as not real,  but as due to the false limiting adjuncts of the highest Self.--The  comment of Ramanuja throughout closely follows the words of the Sutras;  on Sutra 6 it simply remarks that the difference of the highest Self  from the individual soul rests thereon that the former as free from all  evil is not subject to the effects of works in the same way as the soul  is [7].--Adhik. II (9, 10) decides that he to whom the Brahmans and  Kshattriyas are but food (Ka/th/a. Up. I, 2, 25) is the highest  Self.--Adhik. III (11, 12) shows that the two entered into the cave  (Ka/th/a Up. I, 3, 1) are Brahman and the individual soul[8].--Adhik. IV  (13-17) shows that the person within the eye mentioned in Ch. Up. IV,  15, 1 is Brahman.--Adhik. V (18-20) shows that the ruler within  (antaraymin) described in B/ri/. Up. III, 7, 3 is Brahman. Sutra 20  clearly enounces the difference of the individual soul and the Lord;  hence /S/a@nkara is obliged to remark that that difference is not  real.--Adhik. VI (21-23) proves that that which cannot be seen, &c,  mentioned in Mu/nd/aka Up. I, 1, 3 is Brahman.--Adhik. VII (24-32) shows  that the atman vai/s/vanara of Ch. Up. V, 11, 6 is Brahman.      PADA III.      Adhik. I (1-7) proves that that within which the heaven, the earth, &c.  are woven (Mu/nd/. Up. II, 2, 5) is Brahman.--Adhik. II (8, 9) shows  that the bhuman referred to in Ch. Up. VII, 23 is Brahman.--Adhik. III  (10-12) teaches that the Imperishable in which, according to B/ri/. Up.  III, 8, 8, the ether is woven is Brahman.--Adhik. IV (13) decides that  the highest person who is to be meditated upon with the syllable Om,  according to Pra/s/na Up. V, 5, is not the lower but the higher  Brahman.--According to Ramanuja the two alternatives are Brahman and  Brahma (jivasamash/t/irupoz/nd/adhipatis /k/aturmukha/h/).--Adhik. V and  VI (comprising, according to /S/a@nkara, Sutras l4-2l) discuss the  question whether the small ether within the lotus of the heart mentioned  in Ch. Up. VIII, 1 is the elemental ether or the individual soul or  Brahman; the last alternative being finally adopted. In favour of the  second alternative the purvapakshin pleads the two passages Ch. Up.  VIII, 3, 4 and VIII, 12, 3, about the serene being (samprasada); for by  the latter the individual soul only can be understood, and in the  chapter, of which the latter passage forms part, there are ascribed to  it the same qualities (viz. freeness from sin, old age, death, &c.) that  were predicated in VIII, 1, of the small ether within the heart.--But  the reply to this is, that the second passage refers not to the  (ordinary) individual soul but to the soul in that state where its true  nature has become manifest, i.e. in which it is Brahman; so that the  subject of the passage is in reality not the so-called individual soul  but Brahman. And in the former of the two passages the soul is mentioned  not on its own account, but merely for the purpose of intimating that  the highest Self is the cause through which the individual soul  manifests itself in its true nature.--What Ramanuja understands by the  avirbhava of the soul will appear from the remarks on IV, 4.    The two next Sutras (22, 23) constitute, according to /S/a@nkara, a new  adhikara/n/a (VII), proving that he 'after whom everything shines, by  whose light all this is lighted' (Ka/th/a Up. II, 5, 15) is not some  material luminous body, but Brahman itself.--According to Ramanuja the  two Sutras do not start a new topic, but merely furnish some further  arguments strengthening the conclusion arrived at in the preceding  Sutras.[9]    Adhik. VIII (24, 25) decides that the person of the size of a thumb  mentioned in Ka/th/a Up. II, 4, 12 is not the individual soul but  Brahman.    The two next adhikara/n/as are of the nature of a digression. The  passage about the a@ngush/th/amatra was explained on the ground that the  human heart is of the size of a span; the question may then be asked  whether also such individuals as belong to other classes than mankind,  more particularly the Gods, are capable of the knowledge of Brahman: a  question finally answered in the affirmative.--This discussion leads in  its turn to several other digressions, among which the most important  one refers to the problem in what relation the different species of  beings stand to the words denoting them (Sutra 28). In connexion  herewith /S/a@nkara treats of the nature of words (/s/abda), opposing  the opinion of the Mima/m/saka Upavarsha, according"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#6)"],[1,"drawn.\" (Hearty applause.) The day when we must draw it has       appeared, contrary to our desire, contrary to our honest efforts to       avoid it. Russia has applied the firebrand to the house. We find       ourselves in a forced war with Russia and France.         Gentlemen, a series of documents, composed in the rush of events,       is in your hands. Allow me to place before you the facts which       characterize our attitude.         From the very beginning of the Austrian conflict we strove and       worked toward the end that this trouble remain confined to       Austria-Hungary and Servia. All Cabinets, especially that of       England, take the same stand; only Russia declares that she must       have a word in the decision of this conflict. Therewith the danger       of European entanglements arises. As soon as the first authentic       reports of the military preparations in Russia reached us we       declared in a friendly but emphatic manner in St. Petersburg that       war measures and military preparations would force us also to       prepare, and that mobilization is closely akin to war.         Russia asserts in what is an apparently friendly manner that she is       not mobilizing against us. In the meantime England tries to mediate       between Vienna and St. Petersburg, in which she is warmly supported       by us. On July 28 the Kaiser telegraphed the Czar, asking him to       consider that Austria-Hungary has the right and that it is her duty       to defend herself against Servian intrigues, which threaten to       undermine her existence. The Kaiser called the attention of the       Czar to their common monarchical interests with regard to the       Serajevo outrage, and asked him personally to support him in order       to establish harmony between Vienna and St. Petersburg.         At about the same hour in which this telegram was sent the Czar       asked the Kaiser for his support and requested him to advise Vienna       to be moderate in its demands. The Kaiser assumed the role of       mediator. Hardly had he begun his activity when Russia mobilized       its entire fighting force against Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary,       however, had mobilized only those army corps which were directed       against Servia; in the north there were only two army corps and       these far from the Russian border.         The Kaiser immediately called the attention of the Czar to the fact       that this mobilization of his forces against Austria-Hungary made       his position as mediator difficult or absolutely impossible. In       spite of this we continued our mediatorial activities in Vienna,       going to the utmost limits of consistency with the terms of our       federal treaty. [\"Very true! Hear, hear!\"] During this time Russia       again spontaneously assured us that her military preparations were       not directed against us. [\"Hear, hear, fie!\"]         The 31st of July arrived. In Vienna the decision was to be made. In       the meantime we had succeeded with our negotiations to reaching a       point where Vienna resumed intercourse with St. Petersburg, which       for some time had been discontinued, but before the final decision       was reached in Vienna the news arrived that Russia had mobilized       its entire fighting force, which meant also against us. [\"Hear,       hear!\"]    Russia's Mobilization.         The Russian Government, which from repeated admonitions knew what       mobilizing on our borders meant, did not notify us of this       mobilization and gave us absolutely no explanation. [\"Hear! hear!\"]       Not until the afternoon of July 31 did the Kaiser receive a message       from the Czar in which he assured him that the attitude of his army       was not hostile toward us. [\"Hear! hear!\" and laughter.]         However, the mobilization against us on the Russian border was on       the night of July 31 already in full progress. While we, at the       request of Russia, were mediating in Vienna, the Russian Army       appeared on our long, almost entirely open border. France, although       not yet mobilizing, was making preparations for war. And we, up to       this point, had intentionally not then called a single soldier of       the reserve, for the sake of European peace. [\"Bravo!\"]         Should we continue to wait with patience until the powers by which       we are surrounded choose the moment for attack? [\"No!\"] To expose       Germany to this danger would have been criminal! [Stormy,       concerted, prolonged \"Very true and bravo!\"--also from the Social       Democrats.] Therefore, on July 31 we demanded that Russia       demobilize, this being the only measure which could save the peace       of Europe. [Hearty approval.] The Imperial Ambassador received,       furthermore, the order to declare to the Russian Government that in       case they did not comply with our demands they should consider that       a state of war exists.         The Imperial Ambassador performed this mission. Up till the present       we have not learned Russia's answer to this demand. [\"Hear, hear!\"]       Telegraphic reports concerning it have not yet reached us, although       the wire still transmits less important messages. [\"Hear, hear!\"]       Therefore, on Aug. 1, at 5 o'clock, when the appointed period of       grace was long past, the Kaiser considered it necessary to       mobilize.         At the same time we had to make sure of the position France would       take. To our direct question whether in case of a German-Russian       war she would remain neutral, France answered that she would do       what she had to do in her own interests. [Laughter.] That was an       evasive if not a negative answer to our question.    Declares France Began War.         In spite of this the Kaiser gave the order that the French border       should be respected. The command was strictly enforced, with a       single exception. France, which mobilized simultaneously with us,       declared that she would respect a zone of ten kilometers from the       border. [\"Hear, hear!\"] And what happened in reality? There were       bomb-throwing flyers, cavalry patrols, invading companies in the       Reichsland, Alsace-Lorraine. [\"Unheard of!\"] Thereby France,       although the condition of war had not yet been declared, had       attacked our territory.         Concerning the French complaints in regard to violations of the       border, I have received from the Chief of the General Staff the       following report: Only one offense has been committed. Contrary to       an emphatic order a patrol of the Fourteenth Army Corps, led by an       officer, crossed the border on Aug. 2. They apparently were killed.       Only one man returned. However, long before the crossing of the       border French flyers were dropping bombs in Southern Germany, and       at Schluchtpass the French troops had attacked our border troops.         Until the present our troops have confined their activity to the       protection of our borders. They are now on the defense, and       necessity recognizes no law. [\"Very true!\"]         Our troops have occupied Luxemburg, and perhaps have also found it       necessary to enter Belgian territory. [Hearty applause.] This is       contrary to international law. The French Government has declared       in Brussels they will respect the neutrality of Belgium as long as       she respects the opponent. We knew, however, that France was ready       to invade Belgium. [\"Hear, hear!\"] France could wait; we, however,       could not, because a French invasion in our lower Rhein flank       would have proved fatal.         So we were forced to disregard the protests of the Luxemburg and       Belgian Governments. We shall try to make good the injustice we       have committed as soon as our military goal has been reached.       [Applause.] Who like we are fighting for the highest, must only       consider how victory can be gained. [Enthusiastic applause in       entire house.]         Gentlemen, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with       Austria-Hungary. With reference to England, the declaration which       Sir Edward Grey made in the House of Commons yesterday plainly       shows our attitude. We have assured England that as long as she       remains neutral our fleet will not attack the northern coast of       France and that the territorial integrity and independence of       Belgium will not be violated. This declaration I repeat before the       whole world, and I can add that so long as England remains neutral       we are prepared in case of reciprocity to refrain from all hostile       operations against French merchant vessels. [Applause.]         Gentlemen, so much for the events. I repeat the words of the       Kaiser: \"With a clear conscience Germany goes to the battlefield.\"       [Enthusiastic approval.] We are fighting for the fruits of our       peaceful industry, for the inheritance of a great past, and for our       future.         The fifty years of which Moltke spoke, and in which we should stand       armed and ready to protect our inheritance and the acquisitions of       1870, have not yet passed. The hour of trial for the German nation       has struck, but we are facing it with confidence. [Stormy       approval.]         Our army is in the field, our fleet is ready for battle, and behind       it stands the entire German Nation. [Enthusiastic applause from the       entire house.] The entire nation! [with a gesture particularly       directed toward the Social Democrats. Renewed applause, in which       the Social Democrats also joined.] You, gentlemen, realize your       duty in its entirety. The question needs no further consideration,       and I request speedy action.
