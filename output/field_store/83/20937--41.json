CHAPTER II    GENERAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSITIONS      Sec. 1. Since Logic discusses the proof or disproof, or (briefly) the  testing of propositions, we must begin by explaining their nature. A  proposition, then, may first be described in the language of grammar as  _a sentence indicative_; and it is usually expressed in the present  tense.    It is true that other kinds of sentences, optative, imperative,  interrogative, exclamatory, if they express or imply an assertion, are  not beyond the view of Logic; but before treating such sentences, Logic,  for greater precision, reduces them to their equivalent sentences  indicative. Thus, _I wish it were summer_ may be understood to mean,  _The coming of summer is an object of my desire_. _Thou shalt not kill_  may be interpreted as _Murderers are in danger of the judgment_.  Interrogatories, when used in argument, if their form is affirmative,  have negative force, and affirmative force if their form is negative.  Thus, _Do hypocrites love virtue?_ anticipates the answer, _No_. _Are  not traitors the vilest of mankind?_ anticipates the answer, _Yes_. So  that the logical form of these sentences is, _Hypocrites are not lovers  of virtue_; _Traitors are the vilest of mankind_. Impersonal  propositions, such as _It rains_, are easily rendered into logical forms  of equivalent meaning, thus: _Rain is falling_; or (if that be  tautology), _The clouds are raining_. Exclamations may seem capricious,  but are often part of the argument. _Shade of Chatham!_ usually means  _Chatham, being aware of our present foreign policy, is much  disgusted_. It is in fact, an appeal to authority, without the  inconvenience of stating what exactly it is that the authority declares.    Sec. 2. But even sentences indicative may not be expressed in the way most  convenient to logicians. _Salt dissolves in water_ is a plain enough  statement; but the logician prefers to have it thus: _Salt is soluble in  water_. For he says that a proposition is analysable into three  elements: (1) a Subject (as _Salt_) about which something is asserted or  denied; (2) a Predicate (as _soluble in water_) which is asserted or  denied of the Subject, and (3) the Copula (_is_ or _are_, or _is not_ or  _are not_), the sign of relation between the Subject and Predicate. The  Subject and Predicate are called the Terms of the proposition: and the  Copula may be called the sign of predication, using the verb 'to  predicate' indefinitely for either 'to affirm' or 'to deny.' Thus _S is  P_ means that the term _P_ is given as related in some way to the term  _S_. We may, therefore, further define a Proposition as 'a sentence in  which one term is predicated of another.'    In such a proposition as _Salt dissolves_, the copula (_is_) is  contained in the predicate, and, besides the subject, only one element  is exhibited: it is therefore said to be _secundi adjacentis_. When all  three parts are exhibited, as in _Salt is soluble_, the proposition is  said to be _tertii adjacentis_.    For the ordinary purposes of Logic, in predicating attributes of a thing  or class of things, the copula _is_, or _is not_, sufficiently  represents the relation of subject and predicate; but when it is  desirable to realise fully the nature of the relation involved, it may  be better to use a more explicit form. Instead of saying  _Salt--is--soluble_, we may say _Solubility--coinheres with--the nature  of salt_, or _The putting of salt in water--is a cause of--its  dissolving_: thus expanding the copula into a full expression of the  relation we have in view, whether coinherence or causation.    Sec. 3. The sentences of ordinary discourse are, indeed, for the most  part, longer and more complicated than the logical form of propositions;  it is in order to prove them, or to use them in the proof of other  propositions, that they are in Logic reduced as nearly as possible to  such simple but explicit expressions as the above (_tertii adjacentis_).  A Compound Proposition, reducible to two or more simple ones, is said to  be exponible.    The modes of compounding sentences are explained in every grammar-book.  One of the commonest forms is the copulative, such as _Salt is both  savoury and wholesome_, equivalent to two simple propositions: _Salt is  savoury; Salt is wholesome. Pure water is neither sapid nor odorous_,  equivalent to _Water is not sapid; Water is not odorous_. Or, again,  _Tobacco is injurious, but not when used in moderation_, equivalent to  _Much tobacco is injurious; a little is not_.    Another form of Exponible is the Exceptive, as _Kladderadatsch is  published daily, except on week-days_, equivalent to _Kladderadatsch is  published on Sunday; it is not published any other day_. Still another  Exponible is the Exclusive, as _Only men use fire_, equivalent to _Men  are users of fire; No other animals are_. Exceptive and exclusive  sentences are, however, equivalent forms; for we may say,  _Kladderadatsch is published only on Sunday_; and _No animals use fire,  except men_.    There are other compound sentences that are not exponible, since, though  they contain two or more verbal clauses, the construction shows that  these are inseparable. Thus, _If cats are scarce, mice are plentiful_,  contains two verbal clauses; but _if cats are scarce_ is conditional,  not indicative; and _mice are plentiful_ is subject to the condition  that _cats are scarce_. Hence the whole sentence is called a Conditional  Proposition. For the various forms of Conditional Propositions see chap.  v. Sec. 4.    But, in fact, to find the logical force of recognised grammatical forms  is the least of a logician's difficulties in bringing the discourses of  men to a plain issue. Metaphors, epigrams, innuendoes and other figures  of speech present far greater obstacles to a lucid reduction whether for  approval or refutation. No rules can be given for finding everybody's  meaning. The poets have their own way of expressing themselves;  sophists, too, have their own way. And the point often lies in what is  unexpressed. Thus, \"barbarous nations make, the civilised write  history,\" means that civilised nations do not make history, which none  is so brazen as openly to assert. Or, again, \"Alcibiades is dead, but X  is still with us\"; the whole meaning of this 'exponible' is that X would  be the lesser loss to society. Even an epithet or a suffix may imply a  proposition: _This personage_ may mean _X is a pretentious nobody_.    How shall we interpret such illusive predications except by cultivating  our literary perceptions, by reading the most significant authors until  we are at home with them? But, no doubt, to disentangle the compound  propositions, and to expand the abbreviations of literature and  conversation, is a useful logical exercise. And if it seem a laborious  task thus to reduce to its logical elements a long argument in a speech  or treatise, it should be observed that, as a rule, in a long discourse  only a few sentences are of principal importance to the reasoning, the  rest being explanatory or illustrative digression, and that a close  scrutiny of these cardinal sentences will frequently dispense us from  giving much attention to the rest.    Sec. 4. But now, returning to the definition of a Proposition given in Sec. 2,  that it is 'a sentence in which one term is predicated of another,' we  must consider what is the import of such predication. For the  definition, as it stands, seems to be purely Nominalist. Is a  proposition nothing more than a certain synthesis of words; or, is it  meant to correspond with something further, a synthesis of ideas, or a  relation of facts?    Conceptualist logicians, who speak of judgments instead of  propositions, of course define the judgment in their own language.  According to Hamilton, it is \"a recognition of the relation of  congruence or confliction in which two concepts stand to each other.\" To  lighten the sentence, I have omitted one or two qualifications  (Hamilton's _Lectures on Logic_, xiii.). \"Thus,\" he goes on \"if we  compare the thoughts _water_, _iron_, and _rusting_, we find them  congruent, and connect them into a single thought, thus: _water rusts  iron_--in that case we form a judgment.\" When a judgment is expressed in  words, he says, it is called a proposition.    But has a proposition no meaning beyond the judgment it expresses? Mill,  who defines it as \"a portion of discourse in which a predicate is  affirmed or denied of a subject\" (_Logic_, Book 1., chap. iv. Sec. 1.),  proceeds to inquire into the import of propositions (Book 1., chap. v.),  and finds three classes of them: (a) those in which one proper name is  predicated of another; and of these Hobbes's Nominalist definition is  adequate, namely, that a proposition asserts or denies that the  predicate is a name for the same thing as the subject, as _Tully is  Cicero_.    (b) Propositions in which the predicate means a part (or the whole) of  what the subject means, as _Horses are animals_, _Man is a rational  animal_. These are Verbal Propositions (see below: chap. v. Sec. 6), and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#6)"],[1,"be Thine.    Samuel Stennett was one of the most respected and influential ministers  of the Dissenting persuasion, and a confidant of many of the most  distinguished statesmen of his time. The celebrated John Howard was his  parishoner and intimate friend. His degree of Doctor of Divinity was  bestowed upon him by Aberdeen University. Besides his theological  writings he composed and published thirty-eight hymns, among them--        On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,        When two or three with sweet accord,        Here at Thy table, Lord, we meet,    and--        \"'Tis finished,\" so the Saviour cried.    \"Majestic Sweetness\" began the third stanza of his longer hymn--        To Christ the Lord let every tongue.    Dr. Stennett died in London, Aug. 24, 1795.      _THE TUNE._    For fifty or sixty years \"Ortonville\" has been linked with this devout  hymn, and still maintains its fitting fellowship. The tune, composed in  1830, was the work of Thomas Hastings, and is almost as well-known and  as often sung as his immortal \"Toplady.\" (See chap. 3, \"Rock of Ages.\")      \"ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS' NAME.\"    This inspiring lyric of praise appears to have been written about the  middle of the eighteenth century. Its author, the Rev. Edward Perronet,  son of Rev. Vincent Perronet, Vicar of Shoreham, Eng., was a man of  great faith and humility but zealous in his convictions, sometimes to  his serious expense. He was born in 1721, and, though eighteen years  younger than Charles Wesley, the two became bosom friends, and it was  under the direction of the Wesleys that Perronet became a preacher in  the evangelical movement. Lady Huntingdon later became his patroness,  but some needless and imprudent expressions in a satirical poem, \"The  Mitre,\" revealing his hostility to the union of church and state, cost  him her favor, and his contention against John Wesley's law that none  but the regular parish ministers had the right to administer the  sacraments, led to his complete separation from both the Wesleys. He  subsequently became the pastor of a small church of Dissenters in  Canterbury, where he died, in January, 1792. His piety uttered itself  when near his happy death, and his last words were a Gloria.        All hail the power of Jesus' name!        Let angels prostrate fall;      Bring forth the royal diadem,        To crown Him Lord of all.        Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,        Ye ransomed of the fall,      Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,        And crown Him Lord of all.        Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget        The wormwood and the gall,      Go, spread your trophies at His feet,        And crown Him Lord of all.        Let every tribe and every tongue        That bound creation's call,      Now shout the universal song,        The crowned Lord of all.    With two disused stanzas omitted, the hymn as it stands differs from the  original chiefly in the last stanza, though in the second the initial  line is now transposed to read--        Ye chosen seed of Israel's race.    The fourth stanza now reads--        Let every kindred, every tribe        On this terrestrial ball      To Him all majesty ascribe,        And crown Him Lord of all.    And what is now the favorite last stanza is the one added by Dr.  Rippon--        O that with yonder sacred throng        We at His feet may fall,      And join the everlasting song,        And crown Him Lord of all.      _THE TUNE._    Everyone now calls it \"Old Coronation,\" and it is entitled to the  adjective by this time, being considerably more than a hundred years  of age. It was composed in the very year of Perronet's death and one  wonders just how long the hymn and tune waited before they came  together; for Heaven evidently meant them to be wedded for all time.  This is an American opinion, and no reflection on the earlier English  melody of \"Miles Lane,\" composed during Perronet's lifetime by William  Shrubsole and published with the words in 1780 in the _Gospel Magazine_.  There is also a fine processional tune sung in the English Church to  Perronet's hymn.    The author of \"Coronation\" was Oliver Holden, a self-taught musician,  born in Shirley, Mass., 1765, and bred to the carpenter's trade. The  little pipe organ on which tradition says he struck the first notes of  the famous tune is now in the Historical rooms of the Old State House,  Boston, placed there by its late owner, Mrs. Fanny Tyler, the old  musician's granddaughter. Its tones are as mellow as ever, and the times  that \"Coronation\" has been played upon it by admiring visitors would far  outnumber the notes of its score.    Holden wrote a number of other hymn-tunes, among which \"Cowper,\"  \"Confidence,\" and \"Concord\" are remembered, but none of them had the  wings of \"Coronation,\" his American \"Te Deum.\" His first published  collection was entitled _The American Harmony_, and this was followed by  the _Union Harmony_, and the _Worcester Collection_. He also wrote and  published \"Mt. Vernon,\" and several other patriotic anthems, mainly for  special occasions, to some of which he supplied the words. He was no  hymnist, though he did now and then venture into sacred metre. The new  _Methodist Hymnal_ preserves a simple four-stanza specimen of his  experiments in verse:        They who seek the throne of grace      Find that throne in every place:      If we lead a life of prayer      God is present everywhere.    Sacred music, however, was the good man's passion to the last. He died  in 1844.    \"Such beautiful themes!\" he whispered on his death bed, \"Such beautiful  themes! But I can write no more.\"    The enthusiasm always and everywhere aroused by the singing of  \"Coronation,\" dates from the time it first went abroad in America in  its new wedlock of music and words. \"This tune,\" says an accompanying  note over the score in the old _Carmina Sacra_, \"was a great favorite  with the late Dr. Dwight of Yale College (1798). It was often sung by  the college choir, while he, catching, as it were, the music of the  heavenly world, would join them, and lead with the most ardent  devotion.\"      \"AWAKE AND SING THE SONG.\"    This hymn of six stanzas is abridged from a longer one indited by the  Rev. William Hammond, and published in _Lady Huntingdon's Hymn-book_. It  was much in use in early Methodist revivals. It appears now as it was  slightly altered by Rev. Martin Madan--        Awake and sing the song        Of Moses and the Lamb;      Join every heart and every tongue        To praise the Savior's name.           *       *       *       *       *    The sixth verse is a variation of one of Watts' hymns, and was added in  the _Brethren's Hymn-book_, 1801--        There shall each heart and tongue        His endless praise proclaim,      And sweeter voices join the song        Of Moses and the Lamb.    The Rev. William Hammond was born Jan. 6, 1719, at Battle, Sussex, Eng.,  and educated at St. John's College, Cambridge. Early in his ministerial  life he was a Calvinistic Methodist, but ultimately joined the  Moravians. Died in London, Aug. 19, 1793. His collection of _Psalms and  Hymns and Spiritual Songs_ was published in 1745.    The Rev. Martin Madan, son of Col. Madan, was born 1726. He founded Lock  Hospital, Hyde Park, and long officiated as its chaplain. As a preacher  he was popular, and his reputation as a composer of music was  considerable. There is no proof that he wrote any original hymns, but he  amended, pieced and expanded the work of others. Died in 1770.      _THE TUNE._    The hymn has had a variety of musical interpretations. The more modern  piece is \"St. Philip,\" by Edward John Hopkins, Doctor of Music, born at  Westminster, London, June 30, 1818. From a member of the Chapel Royal  boy choir he became organist of the Michtam Church, Surrey, and  afterwards of the Temple Church, London. Received his Doctor's degree  from the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1882.    [Illustration: Joseph Haydn]      \"CROWN HIS HEAD WITH ENDLESS BLESSING.\"    The writer of this hymn was William Goode, who helped to found the  English Church Missionary Society, and was for twenty years the  Secretary of the \"Society for the Relief of Poor Pious Clergymen.\" For  celebrating the praise of the Saviour, he seems to have been of like  spirit and genius with Perronet. He was born in Buckingham, Eng., April  2, 1762; studied for the ministry and became a curate, successor of  William Romaine. His spiritual maturity was early, and his habits of  thought were formed amid associations such as the young Wesleys and  Whitefield sought. Like them, even in his student days he proved his  aspiration for purer religious life by an evangelical zeal that cost him  the ridicule of many of his school-fellows, but the meetings for  conference and prayer which he organized among them were not unattended,  and were lasting and salutary in their effect.    Jesus was the theme of his life and song, and was his last word. He died  in 1816.        Crown His head with endless blessing        Who in God the Father's name      With compassion never ceasing        Comes salvation to proclaim.      Hail, ye saints who know His favor,        Who within His gates are found.      Hail, ye saints, th' exalted Saviour,        Let His courts with praise resound.      _THE TUNE._    \"Haydn,\" bearing the name of its great composer, is in several important  hymnals the chosen music for William Goode's devout words. Its strain  and spirit are lofty and melodious and in entire accord with the pious  poet's praise.    Joseph Haydn, son of a poor wheelwright, was born 1732, in Rohron, a  village on the borders of Hungary and Austria. His precocity of musical  talent was such that he began composing at the age of ten years. Prince  Esterhazy discovered his genius when he was poor and friendless, and his  fortune was made.
