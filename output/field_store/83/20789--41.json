(1) This festival of the Purification of the Virgin corresponds  with the old Roman festival of Juno Februata (i. e. purified) which was  held in the last month (February) of the Roman year, and which included  a candle procession of Ceres, searching for Proserpine. (F. Nork, Der  Mystagog.)          III. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ZODIAC    The Vernal Equinox has all over the ancient world, and from the earliest  times, been a period of rejoicing and of festivals in honor of the  Sungod. It is needless to labor a point which is so well known. Everyone  understands and appreciates the joy of finding that the long darkness is  giving way, that the Sun is growing in strength, and that the days are  winning a victory over the nights. The birds and flowers reappear, and  the promise of Spring is in the air. But it may be worth while to give  an elementary explanation of the ASTRONOMICAL meaning of this period,  because this is not always understood, and yet it is very important in  its bearing on the rites and creeds of the early religions. The priests  who were, as I have said, the early students and inquirers, had worked  out this astronomical side, and in that way were able to fix dates and  to frame for the benefit of the populace myths and legends, which were  in a certain sense explanations of the order of Nature, and a kind of  \"popular science.\"    The Equator, as everyone knows, is an imaginary line or circle girdling  the Earth half-way between the North and South poles. If you imagine a  transparent Earth with a light at its very centre, and also imagine the  SHADOW of this equatorial line to be thrown on the vast concave of  the Sky, this shadow would in astronomical parlance coincide with the  Equator of the Sky--forming an imaginary circle half-way between the  North and South celestial poles.    The Equator, then, may be pictured as cutting across the sky either by  day or by night, and always at the same elevation--that is, as seen from  any one place. But the Ecliptic (the other important great circle of the  heavens) can only be thought of as a line traversing the constellations  as they are seen at NIGHT. It is in fact the Sun's path among the fixed  stars. For (really owing to the Earth's motion in its orbit) the Sun  appears to move round the heavens once a year--travelling, always to the  left, from constellation to constellation. The exact path of the sun is  called the Ecliptic; and the band of sky on either side of the Ecliptic  which may be supposed to include the said constellations is called the  Zodiac. How then--it will of course be asked--seeing that the Sun and  the Stars can never be seen together--were the Priests ABLE to map out  the path of the former among the latter? Into that question we need not  go. Sufficient to say that they succeeded; and their success--even with  the very primitive instruments they had--shows that their astronomical  knowledge and acuteness of reasoning were of no mean order.    To return to our Vernal Equinox. Let us suppose that the Equator and  Ecliptic of the sky, at the Spring season, are represented by two lines  Eq. and Ecl. crossing each other at the point P. The Sun, represented  by the small circle, is moving slowly and in its annual course along the  Ecliptic to the left. When it reaches the point P (the dotted circle)  it stands on the Equator of the sky, and then for a day or two, being  neither North nor South, it shines on the two terrestrial hemispheres  alike, and day and night are equal. BEFORE that time, when the sun  is low down in the heavens, night has the advantage, and the days are  short; AFTERWARDS, when the Sun has travelled more to the left, the days  triumph over the nights. It will be seen then that this point P where  the Sun's path crosses the Equator is a very critical point. It is the  astronomical location of the triumph of the Sungod and of the arrival of  Spring.    How was this location defined? Among what stars was the Sun moving at  that critical moment? (For of course it was understood, or supposed,  that the Sun was deeply influenced by the constellation through which it  was, or appeared to be, moving.) It seems then that at the period when  these questions were occupying men's minds--say about three thousand  years ago--the point where the Ecliptic crossed the Equator was, as a  matter of fact, in the region of the constellation Aries or the he-Lamb.  The triumph of the Sungod was therefore, and quite naturally, ascribed  to the influence of Aries. THE LAMB BECAME THE SYMBOL OF THE RISEN  SAVIOR, AND OF HIS PASSAGE FROM THE UNDERWORLD INTO THE HEIGHT OF  HEAVEN. At first such an explanation sounds hazardous; but a thousand  texts and references confirm it; and it is only by the accumulation of  evidence in these cases that the student becomes convinced of a theory's  correctness. It must also be remembered (what I have mentioned before)  that these myths and legends were commonly adopted not only for  one strict reason but because they represented in a general way the  convergence of various symbols and inferences.    Let me enumerate a few points with regard to the Vernal Equinox. In the  Bible the festival is called the Passover, and its supposed institution  by Moses is related in Exodus, ch. xii. In every house a he-lamb was to  be slain, and its blood to be sprinkled on the doorposts of the house.  Then the Lord would pass over and not smite that house. The Hebrew word  is pasach, to pass. (1) The lamb slain was called the Paschal Lamb. But  what was that lamb? Evidently not an earthly lamb--(though certainly  the earthly lambs on the hillsides WERE just then ready to be killed and  eaten)--but the heavenly Lamb, which was slain or sacrificed when the  Lord \"passed over\" the equator and obliterated the constellation Aries.  This was the Lamb of God which was slain each year, and \"Slain since the  foundation of the world.\" This period of the Passover (about the 25th  March) was to be (2) the beginning of a new year. The sacrifice of  the Lamb, and its blood, were to be the promise of redemption. The  door-frames of the houses--symbols of the entrance into a new life--were  to be sprinkled with blood. (3) Later, the imagery of the saving power  of the blood of the Lamb became more popular, more highly colored. (See  St. Paul's epistles, and the early Fathers.) And we have the expression  \"washed in the blood of the Lamb\" adopted into the Christian Church.     (1) It is said that pasach sometimes means not so much to pass  over, as to hover over and so protect. Possibly both meanings enter in  here. See Isaiah xxxi. 5.     (2) See Exodus xii. i.     (3) It is even said (see The Golden Bough, vol. iii, 185) that  the doorways of houses and temples in Peru were at the Spring festival  daubed with blood of the first-born children--commuted afterwards to the  blood of the sacred animal, the Llama. And as to Mexico, Sahagun, the  great Spanish missionary, tells us that it was a custom of the people  there to \"smear the outside of their houses and doors with blood drawn  from their own ears and ankles, in order to propitiate the god of  Harvest\" (Kingsborough's Mexican Antiquities, vol. vi, p. 235).      In order fully to understand this extraordinary expression and its  origin we must turn for a moment to the worship both of Mithra, the  Persian Sungod, and of Attis the Syrian god, as throwing great light  on the Christian cult and ceremonies. It must be remembered that in the  early centuries of our era the Mithra-cult was spread over the whole  Western world. It has left many monuments of itself here in Britain.  At Rome the worship was extremely popular, and it may almost be said  to have been a matter of chance whether Mithraism should overwhelm  Christianity, or whether the younger religion by adopting many of the  rites of the older one should establish itself (as it did) in the face  of the latter.    Now we have already mentioned that in the Mithra cult the slaying of a  Bull by the Sungod occupies the same sort of place as the slaving of the  Lamb in the Christian cult. It took place at the Vernal Equinox and the  blood of the Bull acquired in men's minds a magic virtue. Mithraism was  a greatly older religion than Christianity; but its genesis was similar.  In fact, owing to the Precession of the Equinoxes, the crossing-place of  the Ecliptic and Equator was different at the time of the establishment  of Mithra-worship from what it was in the Christian period; and the  Sun instead of standing in the He-lamb, or Aries, at the Vernal Equinox  stood, about two thousand years earlier (as indicated by the dotted line  in the diagram), in this very constellation of the Bull. (1) The bull  therefore became the symbol of the triumphant God, and the sacrifice  of the bull a holy mystery. (Nor must we overlook here the agricultural  appropriateness of the bull as the emblem of Spring-plowings and of  service to man.)     (1) With regard to this point, see an article in the Nineteenth  Century for September 1900, by E. W. Maunder of the Greenwich  Observatory on \"The Oldest Picture Book\" (the Zodiac). Mr. Maunder  calculates that the Vernal Equinox was in the centre of the Sign of  the Bull 5,000 years ago. (It would therefore be in the centre of Aries  2,845 years ago--allowing 2,155 years for the time occupied in passing  from one Sign to another.) At the earlier period the Summer solstice was  in the centre of Leo, the Autumnal equinox in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#6)"],[1," far pervasive  odor; it flushes the wide acres of the prairie with grass and flowers,  fills the valleys with trees, and covers the hills with corn, a  single blade of which all the power of man could not make.    This power is also fit and able to survive. The engineer Stephenson  once asked Dr. Buckland, \"What is the power that drives that train?\"  pointing to one thundering by. \"Well, I suppose it is one of your  big engines.\" \"But what drives the engine?\" \"Oh, very likely a canny  Newcastle driver.\" \"No, sir,\" said the engineer, \"it is sunshine.\"  The doctor was too dull to take it in. Let us see if we can trace  such an evident effect to that distant cause. Ages ago the warm  sunshine, falling on the scarcely lifted hills of Pennsylvania,  caused the reedy vegetation to grow along the banks of [Page 31]  shallow seas, accumulated vast amounts of this vegetation, sunk it  beneath the sea, roofed it over with sand, compacted the sand into  rock, and changed this vegetable matter--the products of the  sunshine--into coal; and when it was ready, lifted it once more, all  garnered for the use of men, roofed over with mighty mountains. We  mine the coal, bring out the heat, raise the steam, drive the train,  so that in the ultimate analyses it is sunshine that drives the  train. These great beds of coal are nothing but condensed  sunshine--the sun's great force, through ages gone, preserved for  our use to-day. And it is so full of force that a piece of coal that  will weigh three pounds (as big as a large pair of fists) has as  much power in it as the average man puts into a day's work. Three  tons of coal will pump as much water or shovel as much sand as the  average man will pump or shovel in a lifetime; so that if a man  proposes to do nothing but work with his muscles, he had better dig  three tons of coal and set that to do his work and then die, because  his work will be better done, and without any cost for the  maintenance of the doer.    Come down below the color vibrations, and we shall find that those  which are too infrequent to be visible, manifest as heat. Naturally  there will be as many different kinds of heat as tints of color,  because there is as great a range of numbers of vibration. It is  our privilege to sift them apart and sort them over, and find what  kinds are best adapted to our various uses.    Take an electric lamp, giving a strong beam of light and heat, and  with a plano-convex lens gather it into a single beam and direct  it upon a thermometer, twenty feet away, that is made of glass  and filled with air. The [Page 32] expansion or contraction of this  air will indicate the varying amounts of heat. Watch your  air-thermometer, on which the beam of heat is pouring, for the  result. There is none. And yet there is a strong current of heat  there. Put another kind of test of heat beyond it and it appears;  coat the air-thermometer with a bit of black cloth, and that will  absorb heat and reveal it. But why not at first? Because the glass  lens stops all the heat that can affect glass. The twenty feet of  air absorbs all the heat that affects air, and no kind of heat is  left to affect an instrument made of glass and air; but there are  kinds of heat enough to affect instruments made of other things.    A very strong current of heat may be sent right through the heart  of a block of ice without melting the ice at all or cooling off  the heat in the least. It is done in this way: Send the beam of  heat through water in a glass trough, and this absorbs all the heat  that can affect water or ice, getting itself hot, and leaving all  other kinds of heat to go through the ice beyond; and appropriate  tests show that as much heat comes out on the other side as goes  in on this side, and it does not melt the ice at all. Gunpowder  may be exploded by heat sent through ice. Dr. Kane, years ago,  made this experiment. He was coming down from the north, and fell  in with some Esquimaux, whom he was anxious to conciliate. He said  to the old wizard of the tribe, \"I am a wizard; I can bring the  sun down out of the heavens with a piece of ice.\" That was a good,  deal to say in a country where there was so little sun. \"So,\" he  writes, \"I took my hatchet, chipped a small piece of ice into the  form of a double-convex lens, [Page 33] smoothed it with my warm  hands, held it up to the sun, and, as the old man was blind, I  kindly burned a blister on the back of his hand to show him I could  do it.\"    These are simple illustrations of the various kinds of heat. The  best furnace or stove ever invented consumes fifteen times as much  fuel to produce a given amount of heat as the furnace in our bodies  consumes to produce a similar amount. We lay in our supplies of  carbon at the breakfast, dinner, and supper table, and keep ourselves  warm by economically burning it with the oxygen we breathe.    Heat associated with light has very different qualities from that  which is not. Sunlight melts ice in the middle, bottom, and top at  once. Ice in the spring-time is honey-combed throughout. A piece  of ice set in the summer sunshine crumbles into separate crystals.  Dark heat only melts the surface.    Nearly all the heat of the sun passes through glass without hinderance;  but take heat from white-hot platinum and only seventy-six per cent.  of it goes through glass, twenty-four per cent. being so constituted  that it cannot pass with facility. Of heat from copper at 752 deg.  only six per cent. can go through glass, the other ninety-four per  cent. being absorbed by it.    The heat of the sun beam goes through glass without [Page 34] any  hinderance whatever. It streams into the room as freely as if there  were no glass there. But what if the furnace or stove heat went  through glass with equal facility? We might as well try to heat our  rooms with the window-panes all out, and the blast of winter  sweeping through them.    The heat of the sun, by its intense vibrations, comes to the earth  dowered with a power which pierces the miles of our atmosphere,  but if our air were as pervious to the heat of the earth, this  heat would flyaway every night, and our temperature would go down  to 200 deg. below zero. This heat comes with the light, and then,  dissociated from it, the number of its vibrations lessened, it is  robbed of its power to get away, and remains to work its beneficent  ends for our good.    Worlds that are so distant as to receive only 1/1000 of the heat  we enjoy, may have atmospheres that retain it all. Indeed it is  probable that Mars, that receives but one-quarter as much heat  as the earth, has a temperature as high as ours. The poet drew on  his imagination when he wrote:      \"Who there inhabit must have other powers,     Juices, and veins, and sense and life than ours;     One moment's cold like theirs would pierce the bone,     Freeze the heart's-blood, and turn us all to stone.\"    The power that journeys along the celestial spaces in the flashing  sunshine is beyond our comprehension. It accomplishes with ease  what man strives in vain to do with all his strength. At West Point  there are some links of a chain that was stretched across the river  to prevent British ships from ascending; these links were made  of two-and-a-quarter-inch iron. A powerful locomotive might tug  in vain at one of them and not stretch it the thousandth part of  an inch. But the heat of a single gas-burner, that glows with the  preserved sunlight of other ages, when suitably applied to the  link, stretches it with ease; such enormous power has a little  heat. There is a certain iron bridge across the Thames at London,  resting on arches. The warm sunshine, acting [Page 35] upon the  iron, stations its particles farther and farther apart. Since the  bottom cannot give way the arches must rise in the middle. As they  become longer they lift the whole bridge, and all the thundering  locomotives and miles of goods-trains cannot bring that bridge down  again until the power of the sunshine has been withdrawn. There is  Bunker Hill Monument, thirty-two feet square at the base, with an  elevation of two hundred and twenty feet. The sunshine of every  summer's day takes hold of that mighty pile of granite with its  aerial fingers, lengthens the side affected, and bends the whole  great mass as easily as one would bend a whipstock. A few years ago  we hung a plummet from the top of this monument to the bottom. At 9  A.M. it began to move toward the west; at noon it swung round toward  the north; in the afternoon it went east of where it first was, and  in the night it settled back to its original place.    The sunshine says to the sea, held in the grasp of gravitation,  \"Rise from your bed! Let millions of tons of water fly on the wings  of the viewless air, hundreds of miles to the distant mountains,  and pour there those millions of tons that shall refresh a whole  continent, and shall gather in rivers fitted to bear the commerce  and the navies of nations.\" Gravitation says, \"I will hold every  particle of this ocean as near the centre of the earth as I can.\"  Sunshine speaks with its word of power, and says, \"Up and away!\"  And in the wreathing mists of morning these myriads of tons rise  in the air, flyaway hundreds of miles, and supply all the Niagaras,  Mississippis and Amazons of earth. The sun says to the earth, wrapped  in the mantle of winter, [Page 36] \"Bloom again;\" and the snows  melt, the ice retires, and vegetation breaks forth, birds sing, and  spring is about us.    Thus it is evident that every force is constitutionally arranged  to be overcome by a higher, and all by the highest. Gravitation of  earth naturally and legitimately yields to the power of the sun's  heat, and then the waters fly into the clouds. It as naturally  and legitimately yields to the power of mind, and the waters of the  Red Sea are divided and stand \"upright as an heap.\" Water naturally  bursts into flame when a bit"]]]
