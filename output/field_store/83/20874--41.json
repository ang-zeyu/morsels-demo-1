A beautiful spring morning dawned on Dry Bench. A cool breeze came from  the mountains and played with the young leaves of the orchard. The  apricots were white with blossoms, and the plums and peaches were just  bursting into masses of pink and white. The alfalfa and wheat fields  were beautifully green. Blessed Morning, what a life promoter, what a  dispeller of fears and bringer of hopes, thou art!    Rupert was out early. After tossing some hay to the horses and cows, he  shouldered his shovel and strode up the ditch, whistling as he went. His  straw hat set well back on his head. His blue \"jumper\" met the blue  overalls which were tucked into a pair of heavy boots. His tune was a  merry one and rang out over the still fields and up to the hills.    Rupert's thoughts were a mixture that morning, and flew from one thing  to another: the ditch which he was to clean and repair; the condition of  the reservoir; the meeting of the school board; the planting of the  garden; the dance at the hall in town; the wonderful spreading  properties of weeds--so on from one subject to another, until he came to  a standstill, leaning on his shovel and looking over his farm and down  to the town, fast growing into a city. From a hundred chimneys smoke was  beginning to come, befouling the clear air of the valley.    \"It is a beautiful sight,\" said he to himself. \"Six years ago and what  was it? Under whose hand has this change grown? Mine. I have done most  of the work, and I can lawfully claim most of the credit. Then it was  worthless, and just the other day I was offered five thousand dollars  for the place. That's pretty good. Father couldn't have done any  better.\"    Rupert was not given to boasting, but it did seem lately that everything  he set his hand to prospered exceedingly. This had brought some  self-exalting thoughts into his mind; not that he talked of them to  others, but he communed with them to himself, nevertheless.    That morning, as he rested his chin on his hands that clasped the end of  his shovel, such thoughts swelled the pride in his heart, and his work  was left undone. The sun came suddenly from behind the peak and flooded  the valley with light; still Rupert stood looking over the fields. In  the distance towards the left he caught sight of a horse and buggy  coming at a good pace along the new country road. He watched it drawing  nearer. A lady was driving. Her horse was on its mettle this morning and  the reins were tight. They were at that ugly place where the road  crosses the canal--he was to repair it that morning--He awoke from his  dreaming with a start, but too late; the horse shied, a wheel went into  the ugly hole, and the occupant was pitched into the dry bottom of the  canal. Rupert ran down the road shouting \"whoa\" to the horse which  galloped past him. The lady scrambled up before Rupert reached her.    \"Are you hurt?\" he inquired.    \"No--no, sir,\" she managed to say. She was pale and trembling. \"Can you  catch my horse? I think he will stop at that barn.\"    \"I'll get your horse, never fear; just so you're not hurt. Let me help  you out of the ditch.\"    She held out a gloved hand and he assisted her up the bank. She was just  a girl, and he could have carried her home, had it been necessary.    \"Thank you, sir, but could you get my horse, please? There, he is  stopping at that house.\"    \"That is where I live. I'll bring him to you, if you will wait.\"    \"Oh, thanks; but I can walk that far. The fall has just shaken me up a  little. I shall soon get over it.\"    They walked down the road to the gate.    \"You must come in and rest,\" said he, \"and I'll take care of your  horse.\" She remonstrated, but he insisted, and brought her into the  kitchen where his mother was busy with breakfast. Rupert explained, and  his mother instantly became solicitous. She drew a rocking chair up to  the fire and with gentle force seated the stranger, continuously asking  questions and exclaiming, \"Too bad, too bad.\"    Rupert readily caught the runaway animal, and, leading him into the  yard, fastened and fed him.    \"Take off your hat, Miss,\" said Mrs. Ames, \"your head'll feel easier. I  know it must ache with such a knock as that. I believe you're cold, too.  Put your feet on the hearth--or here, I'll open the oven door--there!  You must take a cup of coffee with us. It'll warm you. You haven't had  breakfast yet, I dare say.\"    The stranger thanked her and leaned back in the chair quite content. The  fall had really shaken her severely and a pain shot, now and then, into  her head. Rupert foolishly fidgeted about outside before he could make  up his mind to come in. Nina now made her appearance. The coffee was  poured out and the stranger was invited to sit up. Once, twice, Mrs.  Ames spoke to her, but she sat perfectly still. Her face was pale, her  eyes half closed.    \"What's the matter, Miss?\" asked the mother, looking into the girl's  face.    \"Mother, I believe she has fainted,\" said Nina.    The three bent over the still form. Mrs. Ames rubbed the cold hands,  Nina became nervous, and Rupert looked down into the pale, beautiful  face.    \"Yes, she has fainted. It is too warm in here. We must get her in the  sitting-room on the sofa. Rupert, help us.\"    Rupert stood at a distance. The mother and Nina tried to lift her, but  they failed.    \"You'll have to carry her in, Rupert. Come, don't stand there as if you  couldn't move. It's too close in this kitchen.\"    But the young fellow still hesitated. To take a strange, fair girl in  his arms--such a thing he had never done--but he must do so now. He put  his strong arms under her and lifted her as he would a child, and  carried her into the next room, where he laid his burden on the sofa.  The cool air had its effect, and she opened her eyes and smiled into the  faces that were bent over her.    \"Lie still, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ames. \"You have been hurt more than you  think.\"    \"Did I faint?--yes, I must have--but I'm not hurt.\" She tried to rise,  but with a moan she sank back on the pillow which Nina had brought.    \"I'll go for the doctor,\" said Rupert, and off he went. When he and  Doctor Chase came in an hour later, the girl was again sitting at the  table with Mrs. Ames and Nina.    \"I met with a slight accident down the road,\" she explained to the  doctor. \"I wasn't quite killed, you see, but these good people are  trying to finish me with their kindness;\" and she laughed merrily.    Her name was Miss Wilton. She was a school teacher, and was on her way  to answer an advertisement of the Dry Bench trustees for a teacher. She  hoped the doctor would pronounce her all right that she might continue  her journey, as she understood it was not far.    \"You have had a severe shaking up, Miss Wilton, but I don't think you  need to postpone your journey more than a few hours,\" was the doctor's  decision.    About noon, Rupert drove Miss Wilton's horse around to the front door  and delivered it to her. With a profusion of thanks, she drove away in  the direction of the chairman of the school trustees. Neither Nina nor  her mother had said anything about Rupert's being on the board. Mrs.  Ames had once seemed to broach the subject, but a look from Rupert was  enough to check her. When the school teacher disappeared down the road,  Rupert again shouldered his shovel, and this time the ugly hole where  the road crossed the canal was mended. That done, he returned home,  hitched a horse to his cart and drove to town.          III.      \"Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain.\"--_Psalms 31:30._      Miss Virginia Wilton was engaged to teach the spring term of school at  the Dry Bench schoolhouse. Why that upland strip bordering the mountains  should be called \"Dry Bench,\" Miss Wilton, at first, did not understand.  If there was a garden spot in this big, ofttimes barren Western country,  more beautiful than Dry Bench, she had in all her rambles failed to find  it. But when the secret of the big reservoir up in the hills came to her  knowledge, she wondered the more; and one member of the school board  from that moment rose to a higher place in her estimation; yes, went  past a long row of friends, up, shall it be said to the seat of honor?    Miss Wilton gave general satisfaction, and she was engaged for the next  school year.    For one whole year, the school teacher had passed the Ames farm twice  each day. She called often on Mrs. Ames, and Nina became her fast  friend. During those cool May mornings and afternoons, when the sky was  cloudless and the breeze came from the mountains, the young school  teacher passed up and down the road and fell to looking with pleasure on  the beautiful fields and orchards around her, and especially at the  Ames farm the central and most flourishing of them all. Perhaps it would  not be fair to analyze her thoughts too closely. She was yet young, only  twenty-two--Rupert's own age; yet Miss Wilton's experiences in this  world's school were greater than that of the simple young farmer's.    Had she designs on the Ames farm and its master? She had been in the  place a year only. How could such thoughts arise within such a little  head? How could such serious schemes brood behind such laughing lips and  sparkling eyes? Strange that such should be the case, but truth is  ofttimes strange.    Since the railroad had been extended through the valley, the town of  Willowby had grown wonderfully. Its long, straight streets enclosing the  rectangular squares, had not crept, but had sped swiftly out into the  country on all sides, and especially towards the mountains, until now  the Ames place was within the corporated city limits. Willowby soon  became a shipping point for grain and fruits to the markets which the  mining towns to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#6)"],[1," could mistake its meaning. Women and  children ran to the churches and knelt in frenzied prayer; men dashed to  and fro, not knowing what to do, while the Spanish soldiers, who had not  believed the American ships could ever pass the harbor torpedoes and  mines, were in a wild panic when they learned that the seemingly  impossible had been done. To add to the terror, rumors spread that the  ferocious natives were gathering at the rear of the city to rush in and  plunder and kill.    When at last the morning light appeared in the sky, the Americans saw  tens of thousands of people crowded along the shore, gazing in terror  out on the bay where rode the hostile fleets, soon to close in deadly  battle. Commodore Dewey coolly scanned the hostile vessels, and grasping  the whole situation, as may be said, at a glance, led in the attack on  the enemy.    While approaching Cavite two mines exploded directly in front of the  _Olympia_. The roar was tremendous and the water was flung hundreds of  feet in the air. Without swerving an inch or halting, Dewey signalled to  the other vessels to pay no attention to the torpedoes, but to steam  straight ahead. It was virtually a repetition of the more emphatic  command of Farragut in Mobile Bay, uttered thirty-four years before.    The batteries on shore let fly at the ships, and the first reply was  made by Captain Coghlan of the _Raleigh_. The _Olympia_ had led the way  into the harbor, and she now headed for the centre of the Spanish fleet.  Calmly watching everything in his field of vision, and knowing when the  exact moment arrived for the beginning of the appalling work, Commodore  Dewey, cool, alert, attired in white duck uniform and a golf cap, turned  to Captain Gridley and said in his ordinary conversational tone:    \"Gridley, you may fire when ready.\"    A series of sharp, crackling sounds followed, like exploding Chinese  crackers, and then the thunderous roars and a vast volume of smoke  rolled over the bay and enveloped the warships that were pouring their  deadly fire into the Spanish vessels. The American ships, in order to  disconcert the aim of the batteries of the enemy, moved slowly in their  terrible ellipses or loops, their sides spouting crimson flame and  answered by the shots of the Spaniards, who fought with a courage  deserving of all praise. The manoeuvring of the American ships led the  breathless swarms on shore to believe they were suffering defeat, and an  exultant telegram to that effect was cabled to Madrid, nearly ten  thousand miles away, where it caused a wild but short-lived rejoicing.    At half-past seven there was a lull. Commodore Dewey drew off to  replenish his magazines, of whose shortness of supply he had received  disturbing reports. Advantage was taken of the cessation to give the men  breakfast, for it is a well accepted principle that sailors as well as  soldiers fight best upon full stomachs. As the wind blew aside the dense  smoke, it was seen that the _Reina Cristina_, the Spanish flagship, was  in flames. Hardly two hours later the American squadron advanced again  to the attack, and Admiral Montojo was observed to transfer his flag  from the doomed _Reina Cristina_ to the _Isla de Cuba_, which soon after  was also ablaze. Amid the crash and roar of the ponderous guns sounded  the shrieks and cries of mortal agony from the Spanish crews, victims  to the matchless gunnery of the Americans.    [Illustration: THE \"OLYMPIA\" IN MANILA BAY.]    The latter pressed their advantage remorselessly. The _Don Juan de  Austria_ was the centre of the heaviest fire, and suddenly a part of the  deck flew upward in the air, carrying with it scores of dead and  wounded. A shot had exploded one of her magazines, and at the sight of  the awful results Admiral Montojo threw up his arms in despair. The crew  refused to leave the blazing ship, and cursing and praying they went  down with her. Then the _Castilla_ burst into one mass of roaring flame,  and the rest of the defeated fleet skurried down the long narrow isle  behind Cavite. Others dashed up a small creek, where they grounded, and  those that were left ran ashore. By half-past eleven the batteries of  Cavite were silenced, the Spanish fleet was destroyed, and the  victorious Americans broke into ringing cheers. The battle of Manila,  one of the most remarkable in naval annals, was won and Commodore Dewey  took rank among the greatest of all the heroes of the sea.    What a marvellous record! Of the Spaniards, the dead and wounded  numbered nearly a thousand, while not a single life had been lost by the  American squadron. Several were wounded, but none seriously. No such  victory between ironclads has thus far taken place in the history of  the world. In the face of mines, torpedoes and shore batteries,  Commodore Dewey had won an overwhelming and crushing victory. The power  of Spain in the Philippines was forever destroyed, and another glorious  victory had been added to the long list that illumines the story of the  American navy.    It was easy for Dewey to compel the surrender of Manila, but with the  prudence that always guides him, he decided that since his force was not  strong enough to occupy and hold the city, to await the arrival of  reinforcements from the United States. They reached Manila the following  August, and, under command of General Wesley Merritt and aided by the  fleet, Manila surrendered, almost at the same hour that the  representatives of Spain and our own officials in Washington signed the  protocol that marked the cessation of war between the two countries.    Now came long and trying weeks and months to Rear Admiral Dewey, he  having been promoted upon receipt of news of his great victory. Peerless  as was his conduct during offensive operations, it was surpassed in many  respects by his course throughout the exasperating period named. Germany  and France were unfriendly and Aguinaldo treacherous, though Great  Britain and Japan were ardent in their sympathy for the United States.  Germany especially was a constant cause of irritation to Admiral Dewey,  whose patience was often tried to the utmost verge. To his tact,  prudence, self-control, firmness, diplomacy and masterful wisdom were  due the fact that no complication with foreign powers occurred and that  the United States escaped a tremendous war, whose consequences no one  could foresee or calculate.    Everybody instinctively felt that Admiral Dewey was the real hero of our  war with Spain. The wish was general that he should return home in order  that his countrymen might have opportunity to show their appreciation of  him and to give him fitting honors.    And nothing could be more repugnant than all this to the naval hero, who  is as modest as he is brave. Besides, he felt that his work was by no  means finished in the far East, for, as has been shown, there was need  of delicate diplomacy, prudence and statesmanship. He asked to be  allowed to stay, and he did so, until, the main difficulty being passed,  and his health feeling the result of the tremendous strain that was  never relaxed, he finally set sail in the _Olympia_ for home, leaving  Hong Kong in May, and, one year after his great victory, proceeding at a  leisurely rate that did not bring him to his native shores until the  cool breezes of autumn. On the long voyage hither he was shown the  highest honors everywhere, and Washington or Lincoln could not have  received more grateful homage than was paid to him by his countrymen,  whom he had served so long, so faithfully and so well.    Meanwhile, it should be added, that the rank of full Admiral of the  navy, hitherto borne only by David Glasgow Farragut and David Dixon  Porter, was revived and bestowed, in February, 1899, upon George Dewey,  and of the three none has worn the exalted honor more worthily than the  Green Mountain Boy, who has proven himself the born gentleman and  fighter, the thorough patriot and statesman and the Chevalier Bayard of  the American navy.          THE REVOLUTIONARY BATTLES.          CHAPTER IV.      Birth of the American Navy--The Privateers--Capture of New Providence,  in the Bahamas--Paul Jones--A Clever Exploit--A Skilful Escape--Fine  Seamanship--An Audacious Scheme.        When, on April 19, 1775, the battle of Lexington opened the Revolution  the Colonies did not possess a single ship with which to form the  beginning of a navy. They had for many years been actively engaged in  the coasting trade and some of their vessels did valiant service on the  side of England in the wars against France and Spain. We had a good many  hardy, skilled seamen, who formed the best material from which to man a  navy, and before long Congress undertook the work of building one. That  body ordered the construction of thirteen frigates--one for each  State--and some of these did noble work, but by the close of the war few  of them were left; nearly all had been captured or destroyed.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN JOHN PAUL JONES.]    It was far different with the privateers, which were vessels fitted out  by private parties, under the authority of Congress, to cruise the seas  wherever they chose and capture English vessels wherever they could.  When a prize was taken the lucky officers and crews divided the plunder.  It was a very tempting field for the brave and enterprising Americans  and when, in March, 1776, Congress gave them permission to fit out and  sail privateers, they were quick to use the chance of securing prize  money as it was called. Those swift sailing vessels and their daring  crews sailed out of Salem, Cape Ann, Newburyport, Bristol and other  seacoast towns, and they did not have to hunt long before they found the  richest sort of prizes. In the single year 1776 these privateers  captured 342 British vessels and wrought great havoc among the English  shipping.    In January, 1778, one of these privateers entered the harbor of New  Providence, in the"]]]
