I said that it appeared to me to pledge the people to  resist by-and-by; to which he replied that it was to tide over the  difficulty of the moment, seeing that my support, the troops, were a  fortnight's march distant, and that by the time the answer to the  protest came, all desire of opposition would have died out. I  therefore did not persuade him from his protest.    You will see, when the proclamation reaches you, that I have taken  high ground. Nothing but annexation will or can save the State, and  nothing else can save South Africa from the direst consequences. All  the thinking and intelligent people know this, and will be thankful  to be delivered from the thraldom of petty factions, by which they  are perpetually kept in a state of excitement and unrest, because the  Government, and everything connected with it, is a thorough sham.    This arrangement with President Burgers was a most improper  compromise on both sides. Moreover, Shepstone received the protests  of the Executive Council and of the Volksraad before he issued his  proclamation. He had plenty of evidence to show that even if his  action was approved by the majority, the Boers were sufficiently  divided to demand some delay. He knew that the members of the  Government and of the Raad would not face the responsibility of  relinquishing the State's independence, although he received  private assurances and entreaties encouraging him to act. He had  representations and deputations from the Boers themselves,  sufficient in weight and number to warrant his belief that a large  proportion of the people desired annexation. He should not have  allowed the 'hedging' that was practised at his expense. The Boer  leaders were 'between the devil and the deep sea.' There can be no  doubt whatever that they dearly loved and prized their independence,  and would have fought even then for it had they been in a position  to preserve and profit by it; but they were not. They dared neither  ask for relief at the price of annexation, nor reject the proffered  relief at the price of continuing the hopeless struggle. So they  compromised. They took the relief, they accepted pay of the new  Government, and entered a protest, so as to put themselves right  with the records and stand well with untamed ones of the party.    The Act of Annexation is so generally condemned by the friends and  sympathizers of the Boers, and is so persistently quoted by them as  the cause of the Boer War, that it is only right to show clearly what  the opinion was at that time; and if it be deemed that overmuch space  is given to this matter, the answer is, that it is quoted now as the  crime which gave rise to the present hatred and mistrust of England,  and it is all-important that the truth should be clear.    This is what Mr. J.F. Celliers, the patriotic editor of the Boer  newspaper, _De Volksstem_, wrote in reviewing the work of the special  session of the Volksraad, convened to deal with the questions of Lord  Carnarvon's Federation Bill, and the rescuing of the country from  ruin and chaos:--'During the session we have repeatedly had occasion  to comment on the doings of the Raad. These comments have not been  favourable, and we regret to say that we have found in the closing  scenes of our Legislature no reason to alter our opinions.' Then  follows a scathing account of the 'work done,' in which occur such  references as:--'With the exception of a couple of members,  no one had the sense or manliness to go into the question of  confederation'; and 'The most surprising feature of the whole  affair was this--that most of the speakers seemed not to have the  faintest conception of the desperate condition in which the country  stood....' And again, under date of March 28: 'About three months  ago we said we would prefer confederation under the British flag if  the state of anarchy then threatening were to continue. We know that  a good and stable Government is better than anarchy any day.'    It is noteworthy that the writer of the above is the same Mr.  Celliers who, two years later, was put in gaol by Colonel Lanyon on a  charge of sedition, because he attacked the Administration for its  failure to keep the promises made at the time of annexation.    Three thousand out of eight thousand voters actually signed petitions  in favour of annexation. In the Raad, President Burgers openly  reproached members for proclaiming in public, and for improper  reasons, views diametrically opposed to those privately expressed on  the confederation and annexation questions; and refused to consult  with three out of four members appointed as a deputation to confer  with him on these subjects, because they had not paid their taxes,  and had so helped by example, not less than by the actual offence, to  cause the ruin of the country and the loss of independence. And on  March 3 President Burgers read an address to the Raad, in which the  following words occur:    'I would rather be a policeman under a strong Government than the  President of such a State. It is you--you members of the Raad and the  Boers--who have lost the country, who have sold your independence for  a _soupe_ (a drink). You have ill-treated the natives, you have shot  them down, you have sold them into slavery, and now you have to pay  the penalty.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'We should delude ourselves by entertaining the hope that matters  would mend by-and-by. It would only be self-deceit. I tell you  openly, matters are as bad as they ever can be; they cannot be worse.  These are bitter truths, and people may perhaps turn their backs on  me; but then I shall have the consolation of having done my duty.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'It is said here this or that man must be released from taxes,  because the Kaffirs have driven them off their farms, and occupy the  latter. By this you proclaim to the world that the strongest man is  master here, that the right of the strongest obtains here.' [Mr.  Mare: 'This is not true.'] 'Then it is not true what the honourable  member, Mr. Breytenbach, has told us about the state of the Lydenburg  district; then it is not true either what another member has said  about the farms in Zoutpansberg, which are occupied by Kaffirs.  Neither is it true, then, what I saw with my own eyes at Lydenburg,  where the burghers had been driven off their farms by the Kaffirs,  and where Johannes was ploughing and sowing on the land of a burgher.  These are facts, and they show that the strongest man is the master  here. The fourth point which we have to take into account affects our  relations with our English neighbours. It is asked, What have they  got to do with our position? I tell you, as much as we have to do  with that of our Kaffir neighbours. As little as we can allow  barbarities among the Kaffirs on our borders, as little can they  allow that in a state on their borders anarchy and rebellion should  prevail.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'Do you know what has recently happened in Turkey? Because no  civilized government was carried on there, the Great Powers  interfered and said, \"Thus far, and no further.\" And if this is done  to an empire, will a little republic be excused when it misbehaves?        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'Complain to other Powers, and seek justice there? Yes, thank God!  justice is still to be found, even for the most insignificant; but it  is precisely the justice which will convict us. If we want justice,  we must be in a position to ask it with unsullied hands.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'Whence has arisen that urgency to make an appeal for interference  elsewhere? Has that appeal been made only by enemies of the State? Oh  no, gentlemen; it has arisen from real grievances. Our people have  degenerated from their former position; they have become demoralised;   they are not what they ought to be.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    'To-day a bill for L1,100 was laid before me for signature; but I  would sooner have cut off my right hand than sign that paper, for I  have not the slightest ground to expect that when that bill becomes  due there will be a penny to pay it with.'        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    The President added, and his statements remained uncontradicted:    The principal thing which had brought them to their present position  was that to which they would not give attention. It was not this or  that thing which impeded their way, but they themselves stopped the  way; and if they asked him what prevented the people from remaining  obstruction, owing to the inherent incapacity and weakness of the  people. But whence this weakness? Was it because they were deformed?  because they were worse than other people? because they were too few  and too insignificant to occupy the country? Those arguments did not  weigh with him. They were not true; he did not consider them of any  importance. The people were as good as any other people, but they  were completely demoralized; they had lost faith in God, reliance  upon themselves, or trust in each other. Hence he believed they were  inherently weak.        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    He did not believe that a new constitution would save them; for as  little as the old constitution had brought them to ruin, so little  would a new constitution bring them salvation.        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    The Great Powers, with all their greatness, all their thousands of  soldiers, would fall as quickly as this State had fallen, and even  more quickly, if their citizens were to do what the citizens of this  State had done; if the citizens of England had behaved towards the  Crown as the burghers of this State had behaved to their Government,  England would never have stood as long as she had, not even as long  as this State had stood.

The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of the  American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God and to  champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members of  parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a universal  script and language; His warnings to William I, the conqueror of Napoleon  III; the reproof He administers to Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria;  His reference to \"the lamentations of Berlin\" in His apostrophe to \"the  banks of the Rhine\"; His condemnation of \"the throne of tyranny\"  established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction of its  \"outward splendour\" and of the tribulations destined to overtake its  inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He addresses to His native  city, assuring her that God had chosen her to be \"the source of the joy of  all mankind\"; His prophecy that \"the voice of the heroes of K{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}urasan\"  will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men  \"endued with mighty valour\" will be raised up in Kirman who will make  mention of Him; and finally, His magnanimous assurance to a perfidious  brother who had afflicted Him with such anguish, that an \"ever-forgiving,  all-bounteous\" God would forgive him his iniquities were he only to  repent--all these further enrich the contents of a Book designated by its  Author as \"the source of true felicity\", as the \"Unerring Balance\", as the  \"Straight Path\" and as the \"quickener of mankind\".    The laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this Book,  Baha'u'llah, moreover, has specifically characterized as \"the breath of  life unto all created things\", as \"the mightiest stronghold\", as the  \"fruits\" of His \"Tree\", as \"the highest means for the maintenance of order  in the world and the security of its peoples\", as \"the lamps of His wisdom  and loving-providence\", as \"the sweet-smelling savour of His garment\", and  the \"keys\" of His \"mercy\" to His creatures. \"This Book\", He Himself  testifies, \"is a heaven which We have adorned with the stars of Our  commandments and prohibitions.\" \"Blessed the man\", He, moreover, has  stated, \"who will read it, and ponder the verses sent down in it by God,  the Lord of Power, the Almighty. Say, O men! Take hold of it with the hand  of resignation... By My life! It hath been sent down in a manner that  amazeth the minds of men. Verily, it is My weightiest testimony unto all  people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and  all who are on earth.\" And again: \"Blessed the palate that savoureth its  sweetness, and the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured  therein, and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions and  mysteries. By God! Such is the majesty of what hath been revealed therein,  and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions that the loins of  utterance shake when attempting their description.\" And finally: \"In such  a manner hath the Kitab-i-Aqdas been revealed that it attracteth and  embraceth all the divinely appointed Dispensations. Blessed those who  peruse it! Blessed those who apprehend it! Blessed those who meditate upon  it! Blessed those who ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it  hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it. Erelong will its  sovereign power, its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be  manifested on earth.\"              THE KITAB-I-AQDAS       In The Name Of Him Who Is The Supreme Ruler Over All That Hath Been And                              All That Is To Be      1 The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of  Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws,  Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the  world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good;  and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be the author of  every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime  station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of  Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable.  Neither is acceptable without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him  Who is the Source of Divine inspiration.    2 They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that the  precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the maintenance  of order in the world and the security of its peoples. He that turneth  away from them is accounted among the abject and foolish. We, verily, have  commanded you to refuse the dictates of your evil passions and corrupt  desires, and not to transgress the bounds which the Pen of the Most High  hath fixed, for these are the breath of life unto all created things. The  seas of Divine wisdom and Divine utterance have risen under the breath of  the breeze of the All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of  understanding! They that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His  commandments, and have turned back on their heels, these have erred  grievously in the sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High.    3 O ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are the  lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy  for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the Will  of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. Were any man to taste the sweetness  of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he  would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce  them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His  commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and  loving-kindness.    4 Say: From My laws the sweet-smelling savour of My garment can be  smelled, and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted upon  the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My  omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words: \"Observe My  commandments, for the love of My beauty.\" Happy is the lover that hath  inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden  with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe. By My life! He  who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful  favour will circle around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring  of My creation.    5 Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay,  rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and  power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath  revealed. Meditate upon this, O men of insight!    6 We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you, with nine rak'ahs, to be  offered at noon and in the morning and the evening unto God, the Revealer  of Verses. We have relieved you of a greater number, as a command in the  Book of God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omnipotent, the  Unrestrained. When ye desire to perform this prayer, turn ye towards the  Court of My Most Holy Presence, this Hallowed Spot that God hath made the  Centre round which circle the Concourse on High, and which He hath decreed  to be the Point of Adoration for the denizens of the Cities of Eternity,  and the Source of Command unto all that are in heaven and on earth; and  when the Sun of Truth and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the  Spot that We have ordained for you. He, verily, is Almighty and  Omniscient.    7 Everything that is hath come to be through His irresistible decree.  Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance, they  must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to cause the  heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doeth what He pleaseth.  He chooseth, and none may question His choice. Whatsoever He, the  Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. To this He Who is  the Lord of all creation beareth Me witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet  fragrance of the All-Merciful, and recognized the Source of this  utterance, will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he  may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with  him that hath turned thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His  decisive decree.    8 We have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another Tablet.  Blessed is he who observeth that whereunto he hath been bidden by Him Who  ruleth over all mankind. In the Prayer for the Dead six specific passages  have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses. Let one who is able to  read recite that which hath been revealed to precede these passages; and  as for him who is unable, God hath relieved him of this requirement. He,  of a truth, is the Mighty, the Pardoner.    9 Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit  hath departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the fur of  the sable as ye would that of the beaver, the squirrel, and other animals;  the prohibition of its use hath stemmed, not from the Qur'an, but from the  misconceptions of the divines. He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the  All-Knowing.    10 We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity;  this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. He  hath exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age, as a  bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God hath  granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean,  for We have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down  in the Book; God, indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know"]]]
