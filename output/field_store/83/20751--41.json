If you will let me have her, she shall be  treated with the greatest honour and respect as one dearly beloved.\"    As he thus spoke the good little dwarfs were full of sympathy for him,  and gave him the coffin. Then the prince called his servants, and the  coffin was placed on their shoulders, and they carried it away, followed  by the king's son, who watched it carefully. Now it happened that one of  them made a false step and stumbled. This shook the coffin, and caused  the poisoned piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten to roll out of  her mouth. A little while after she suddenly opened her eyes, lifted up  the coffin-lid, raised herself and was again alive.    \"Oh! where am I?\" she cried.    Full of joy, the king's son approached her, and said, \"Dear Snow-white,  you are safe; you are with me.\"    Then he related to her all that had happened, and what the little dwarfs  had told him about her, and said at last, \"I love you better than all in  the world besides, dear little Snow-white, and you must come with me to  my father's castle and be my wife.\"    Then was Snow-white taken out of the coffin and placed in a carriage to  travel with the prince, and the king was so pleased with his son's  choice that the marriage was soon after celebrated with great pomp and  magnificence.    Now it happened that the stepmother of Snow-white was invited, among  other guests, to the wedding-feast. Before she left her house she stood  in all her rich dress before the magic mirror to admire her own  appearance, but she could not help saying;        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Am I most beautiful of all?\"    Then to her surprise the mirror replied:      \"Fair queen, thou art the fairest here,       But at the palace, now,     The bride will prove a thousand times       More beautiful than thou.\"    Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so dreadfully alarmed  that she knew not what to do. At first she declared she would not go to  this wedding at all, but she felt it impossible to rest until she had  seen the bride, so she determined to go. But what was her astonishment  and vexation when she recognised in the young bride Snow-white herself,  now grown a charming young woman, and richly dressed in royal robes! Her  rage and terror were so great that she stood still and could not move  for some minutes. At last she went into the ballroom, but the slippers  she wore were to her as iron bands full of coals of fire, in which she  was obliged to dance. And so in the red, glowing shoes she continued to  dance till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and  jealousy.          CHAPTER III    THE ENCHANTED STAG      There were once a brother and sister who loved each other dearly; their  mother was dead, and their father had married again a woman who was most  unkind and cruel to them. One day the boy took his sister's hand, and  said to her, \"Dear little sister, since our mother died we have not had  one happy hour. Our stepmother gives us dry hard crusts for dinner and  supper; she often knocks us about, and threatens to kick us out of the  house. Even the little dogs under the table fare better than we do, for  she often throws them nice pieces to eat. Heaven pity us! Oh, if our  dear mother knew! Come, let us go out into the wide world!\"    So they went out, and wandered over fields and meadows the whole day  till evening. At last they found themselves in a large forest; it began  to rain, and the little sister said, \"See, brother, heaven and our  hearts weep together.\" At last, tired out with hunger and sorrow, and  the long journey, they crept into a hollow tree, laid themselves down,  and slept till morning.    When they awoke the sun was high in the heavens, and shone brightly into  the hollow tree, so they left their place of shelter and wandered away  in search of water.    \"Oh, I am so thirsty!\" said the boy. \"If we could only find a brook or a  stream.\" He stopped to listen, and said, \"Stay, I think I hear a running  stream.\" So he took his sister by the hand, and they ran together to  find it.    Now, the stepmother of these poor children was a wicked witch. She had  seen the children go away, and, following them cautiously like a snake,  had bewitched all the springs and streams in the forest. The pleasant  trickling of a brook over the pebbles was heard by the children as they  reached it, and the boy was just stooping to drink, when the sister  heard in the babbling of the brook:        \"Whoever drinks of me, a tiger soon will be.\"    Then she cried quickly, \"Stay, brother, stay! do not drink, or you will  become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces.\"    Thirsty as he was, the brother conquered his desire to drink at her  words, and said, \"Dear sister, I will wait till we come to a spring.\" So  they wandered farther, but as they approached, she heard in the bubbling  spring the words--        \"Who drinks of me, a wolf will be.\"    \"Brother, I pray you, do not drink of this brook; you will be changed  into a wolf, and devour me.\"    Again the brother denied himself and promised to wait; but he said, \"At  the next stream I must drink, say what you will, my thirst is so great.\"    Not far off ran a pretty streamlet, looking clear and bright; but here  also in its murmuring waters, the sister heard the words--        \"Who dares to drink of me,       Turned to a stag will be.\"    \"Dear brother, do not drink,\" she began; but she was too late, for her  brother had already knelt by the stream to drink, and as the first drop  of water touched his lips he became a fawn. How the little sister wept  over the enchanted brother, and the fawn wept also.    He did not run away, but stayed close to her; and at last she said,  \"Stand still, dear fawn; don't fear, I must take care of you, but I will  never leave you.\" So she untied her little golden garter and fastened it  round the neck of the fawn; then she gathered some soft green rushes,  and braided them into a soft string, which she fastened to the fawn's  golden collar, and then led him away into the depths of the forest.    After wandering about for some time, they at last found a little  deserted hut, and the sister was overjoyed, for she thought it would  form a nice shelter for them both. So she led the fawn in, and then went  out alone, to gather moss and dried leaves, to make him a soft bed.    Every morning she went out to gather dried roots, nuts, and berries, for  her own food, and sweet fresh grass for the fawn, which he ate out of  her hand, and the poor little animal went out with her, and played about  as happy as the day was long.    When evening came, and the poor sister felt tired, she would kneel down  and say her prayers, and then lay her delicate head on the fawn's back,  which was a soft warm pillow, on which she could sleep peacefully. Had  this dear brother only kept his own proper form, how happy they would  have been together! After they had been alone in the forest for some  time, and the little sister had grown a lovely maiden, and the fawn a  large stag, a numerous hunting party came to the forest, and amongst  them the king of the country.    The sounding horn, the barking of the dogs, the holloa of the huntsmen,  resounded through the forest, and were heard by the stag, who became  eager to join his companions.    \"Oh dear,\" he said, \"do let me go and see the hunt; I cannot restrain  myself.\" And he begged so hard that at last she reluctantly consented.    \"But remember,\" she said, \"I must lock the cottage door against those  huntsmen, so when you come back in the evening, and knock, I shall not  admit you, unless you say, 'Dear little sister let me in.'\"    He bounded off as she spoke, scarcely stopping to listen, for it was so  delightful for him to breathe the fresh air and be free again.    He had not run far when the king's chief hunter caught sight of the  beautiful animal, and started off in chase of him; but it was no easy  matter to overtake such rapid footsteps. Once, when he thought he had  him safe, the fawn sprang over the bushes and disappeared.    As it was now nearly dark, he ran up to the little cottage, knocked at  the door, and cried, \"Dear little sister, let me in.\" The door was  instantly opened, and oh, how glad his sister was to see him safely  resting on his soft pleasant bed!    A few days after this, the huntsmen were again in the forest; and when  the fawn heard the holloa, he could not rest in peace, but begged his  sister again to let him go.    She opened the door, and said, \"I will let you go this time; but pray do  not forget to say what I told you, when you return this evening.\"    The chief hunter very soon espied the beautiful fawn with the golden  collar, pointed it out to the king, and they determined to hunt it.    They chased him with all their skill till the evening; but he was too  light and nimble for them to catch, till a shot wounded him slightly in  the foot, so that he was obliged to hide himself in the bushes, and,  after the huntsmen were gone, limp slowly home.    One of them, however, determined to follow him at a distance, and  discover where he went. What was his surprise at seeing him go up to a  door and knock, and to hear him say, \"Dear little sister, let me in.\"  The door was only opened a little way, and quickly shut; but the  huntsman had seen enough to make him full of wonder, when he returned  and described to the king what he had seen.    \"We will have one more chase to-morrow,\" said the king, \"and discover  this mystery.\"    In the meantime the loving sister was terribly alarmed at finding the  stag's foot wounded and bleeding. She quickly washed off the blood, and,  after bathing the wound, placed healing herbs on it, and said, \"Lie down  on your bed, dear fawn, and the wound will soon heal, if you rest your  foot.\"    In the morning the wound was so much better that the fawn felt the foot  almost as strong as ever, and so, when he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"seven divisions of Paradise, each of them is twelve  myriads of miles in width and twelve myriads of miles in length.  In the first division dwell the proselytes who embraced Judaism  of their own free will, not from compulsion. The walls are of  glass and the wainscoting of cedar. The prophet Obadiah,[91]  himself a proselyte, is the overseer of this first division. The  second division is built of silver, and the wainscoting thereof  is of cedar. Here dwell those who have repented, and Manasseh,  the penitent son of Hezekiah, presides over them. The third  division is built of silver and gold. Here dwell Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob, and all the Israelites who came out of Egypt, and the  whole generation that lived in the desert.[92] Also David is  there, together with all his sons[93] except Absalom, one of  them, Chileab, still alive. And all the kings of Judah are there,  with the exception of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, who presides  in the second division, over the penitents. Moses and Aaron  preside over the third division. Here are precious vessels of  silver and gold and jewels and canopies and beds and thrones and  lamps, of gold, of precious stones, and of pearls, the best of  everything there is in heaven.[94] The fourth division is built  of beautiful rubies,[95] and its wainscoting is of olive wood.  Here dwell the perfect and the steadfast in faith, and their  wainscoting is of olive wood, because their lives were bitter as  olives to them. The fifth division is built of silver and gold  and refined gold,[96] and the finest of gold and glass and  bdellium, and through the midst of it flows the river Gihon. The  wainscoting is of silver and gold, and a perfume breathes through  it more exquisite than the perfume of Lebanon. The coverings of  the silver and gold beds are made of purple and blue, woven by  Eve, and of scarlet and the hair of goats, woven by angels. Here  dwells the Messiah on a palanquin made of the wood of Lebanon,  \"the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom of gold, the seat of  it purple.\" With him is Elijah. He takes the head of Messiah, and  places it in his bosom, and says to him, \"Be quiet, for the end  draweth nigh.\" On every Monday and Thursday and on Sabbaths and  holidays, the Patriarchs come to him, and the twelve sons of  Jacob, and Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, and all the kings of  Israel and of Judah, and they weep with him and comfort him, and  say unto him, \"Be quiet and put trust in thy Creator, for the end  draweth nigh.\" Also Korah and his company, and Dathan, Abiram,  and Absalom come to him on every Wednesday, and ask him: \"How  long before the end comes full of wonders? When wilt thou bring  us life again, and from the abysses of the earth lift us?\" The  Messiah answers them, \"Go to your fathers and ask them\"; and when  they hear this, they are ashamed, and do not ask their fathers.    In the sixth division dwell those who died in performing a pious  act, and in the seventh division those who died from illness  inflicted as an expiation for the sins of Israel.[97]      THE FOURTH DAY    The fourth day of creation produced the sun, the moon, and the  stars. These heavenly spheres were not actually fashioned on this  day; they were created on the first day, and merely were assigned  their places in the heavens on the fourth.[98] At first the sun  and the moon enjoyed equal powers and prerogatives.[99] The moon  spoke to God, and said: \"O Lord, why didst Thou create the world  with the letter Bet?\" God replied: \"That it might be made known  unto My creatures that there are two worlds.\" The moon: \"O Lord:  which of the two worlds is the larger, this world or the world to  come?\" God: \"The world to come is the larger.\" The moon: \"O Lord,  Thou didst create two worlds, a greater and a lesser world; Thou  didst create the heaven and the earth, the heaven exceeding the  earth; Thou didst create fire and water, the water stronger than  the fire, because it can quench the fire; and now Thou hast  created the sun and the moon, and it is becoming that one of them  should be greater than the other.\" Then spake God to the moon: \"I  know well, thou wouldst have me make Thee greater than the sun.  As a punishment I decree that thou mayest keep but one-sixtieth  of thy light.\" The moon made supplication: \"Shall I be punished  so severely for having spoken a single word?\" God relented: \"In  the future world I will restore thy light, so that thy light may  again be as the light of the sun.\" The moon was not yet  satisfied. \"O Lord,\" she said, \"and the light of the sun, how  great will it be in that day?\" Then the wrath of God was once  more enkindled: \"What, thou still plottest against the sun? As  thou livest, in the world to come his light shall be sevenfold  the light he now sheds.\"[100] The Sun runs his course like a  bridegroom. He sits upon a throne with a garland on his  head.[101] Ninety-six angels accompany him on his daily journey,  in relays of eight every hour, two to the left of him, and two to  the right, two before Him, and two behind. Strong as he is, he  could complete his course from south to north in a single  instant, but three hundred and sixty-five angels restrain him by  means of as many grappling-irons. Every day one looses his hold,  and the sun must thus spend three hundred and sixty-five days on  his course. The progress of the sun in his circuit is an  uninterrupted song of praise to God. And this song alone makes  his motion possible. Therefore, when Joshua wanted to bid the sun  stand still, he had to command him to be silent. His song of  praise hushed, the sun stood still.[102]    The sun is double-faced; one face, of fire, is directed toward  the earth, and one of hail, toward heaven, to cool off the  prodigious heat that streams from the other face, else the earth  would catch afire. In winter the sun turns his fiery face upward,  and thus the cold is produced.[103] When the sun descends in the  west in the evening, he dips down into the ocean and takes a  bath, his fire is extinguished, and therefore he dispenses  neither light nor warmth during the night. But as soon as he  reaches the east in the morning, he laves himself in a stream of  flame, which imparts warmth and light to him, and these he sheds  over the earth. In the same way the moon and the stars take a  bath in a stream of hail before they enter upon their service for  the night.[104]    When the sun and the moon are ready to start upon their round of  duties, they appear before God, and beseech him to relieve them  of their task, so that they may be spared the sight of sinning  mankind. Only upon compulsion they proceed with their daily  course. Coming from the presence of God, they are blinded by the  radiance in the heavens, and they cannot find their way. God,  therefore, shoots off arrows, by the glittering light of which  they are guided. It is on account of the sinfulness of man, which  the sun is forced to contemplate on his rounds, that he grows  weaker as the time of his going down approaches, for sins have a  defiling and enfeebling effect, and he drops from the horizon as  a sphere of blood, for blood is the sign of corruption.[105] As  the sun sets forth on his course in the morning, his wings touch  the leaves on the trees of Paradise, and their vibration is  communicated to the angels and the holy Hayyot, to the other  plants, and also to the trees and plants on earth, and to all the  beings on earth and in heaven. It is the signal for them all to  cast their eyes upward. As soon as they see the Ineffable Name,  which is engraved in the sun, they raise their voices in songs of  praise to God. At the same moment a heavenly voice is heard to  say, \"Woe to the sons of men that consider not the honor of God  like unto these creatures whose voices now rise aloft in  adoration.\"[106] These words, naturally, are not heard by men; as  little as they perceive the grating of the sun against the wheel  to which all the celestial bodies are attached, although the  noise it makes is extraordinarily loud.[107] This friction of the  sun and the wheel produces the motes dancing about in the  sunbeams. They are the carriers of healing to the sick,[108] the  only health-giving creations of the fourth day, on the whole an  unfortunate day, especially for children, afflicting them with  disease.[109] When God punished the envious moon by diminishing  her light and splendor, so that she ceased to be the equal of the  sun as she had been originally,[110] she fell,[111] and tiny  threads were loosed from her body. These are the stars.[112]      THE FIFTH DAY    On the fifth day of creation God took fire[118] and water, and  out of these two elements He made the fishes of the sea.[114] The  animals in the water are much more numerous than those on land.  For every species on land, excepting only the weasel, there is a  corresponding species in the water, and, besides, there are many  found only in the water.[115]    The ruler over the sea-animals is leviathan.[116] With all the  other fishes he was made on the fifth day.[117] Originally he was  created male and female like all the other animals. But when it  appeared that a pair of these monsters might annihilate the whole  earth with their united strength, God killed the female.[119] So  enormous is leviathan that to quench his thirst he needs all the  water that flows from the Jordan into the sea.[119] His food  consists of the fish which go between his jaws of their own  accord.[120] When he is hungry, a hot breath blows from his  nostrils, and it makes the waters of the great sea seething hot.  Formidable though behemot, the other monster, is, he feels  insecure until he is certain that leviathan has satisfied his  thirst.[121] The only thing that can keep him in check is the  stickleback, a little fish which was created for the purpose, and  of which he stands in great awe.[122] But leviathan is more than  merely large and"]]]
