I'll _show_ you one, down the road here a little  piece. Come on--it ain't far.\"    To see a rabbit hole in the ground, Lorraine consented to mount and ride  while Lone walked beside her, agreeing with everything she said that  needed agreement. When she had gone a few rods, however, she began to  call him Charlie and to criticize the direction of the picture. They  should not, she declared, mix murders and thunderstorms in the same  scene. While the storm effect was perfectly _wonderful_, she thought it  rather detracted from the killing. She did not believe in lumping big  stuff together like that. Why not have the killing done by moonlight,  and use the storm when the murderer was getting away, or something like  that? And as for taking them out on location and making all those storm  scenes without telling them in advance so that they could have dry  clothes afterwards, she thought it a perfect outrage! If it were not for  spoiling the picture, she would quit, she asserted indignantly. She  thought the director had better go back to driving a laundry wagon,  which was probably where he came from.    Lone agreed with her, even though he did not know what she was talking  about. He walked as fast as he could, but even so he could not travel  the six miles to the ranch very quickly. He could see that the girl was  burning up with fever, and he could hear her voice growing husky,--could  hear, too, the painful laboring of her breath. When she was not mumbling  incoherent nonsense she was laughing hoarsely at the plight she was in,  and after that she would hold both hands to her chest and moan in a way  that made Lone grind his teeth.    When he lifted her off his horse at the foreman's cottage she was  whispering things no one could understand. Three cowpunchers came  running and hindered him a good deal in carrying her into the house, and  the foreman's wife ran excitedly from one room to the other, asking  questions and demanding that some one do something \"for pity's sake, she  may be dying for all you know, while you stand there gawping like  fool-hens.\"    \"She was out all night in the rain--got lost, somehow. She said she was  coming here, so I brought her on. She's down with a cold, Mrs. Hawkins.  Better take off them wet clothes and put hot blankets around her. And a  poultice or something on her chest, I reckon.\" Lone turned to the door,  stopped to roll a cigarette, and watched Mrs. Hawkins hurrying to  Lorraine with a whisky toddy the cook had mixed for her.    \"A sweat's awful good for a cold like she's got,\" he volunteered  practically. \"She's out of her head--or she was when I found her. But I  reckon that's mostly scare, from being lost all night. Give her a good  sweat, why don't you?\" He reached the doorstep and then turned back to  add, \"She left a grip back somewhere along the road. I'll go hunt it up,  I reckon.\"    He mounted John Doe and rode down to the corral, where two or three  riders were killing time on various pretexts while they waited for  details of Lone's adventure. Delirious young women of the silk-stocking  class did not arrive at the Sawtooth every morning, and it was rumored  already amongst the men that she was some looker, which naturally  whetted their interest in her.    \"I'll bet it's one of Bob's girls, come trailin' him up. Mebby another  of them heart-ballum cases of Bob's,\" hazarded Pop Bridgers, who read  nothing unless it was printed on pink paper, and who refused to believe  that any good could come out of a city. \"Ain't that right, Loney?  Hain't she a heart-ballum girl of Bob's?\"    From the saddle Lone stared down impassively at Pop and Pop's  companions. \"I don't know a thing about her,\" he stated emphatically.  \"She said she was coming to the ranch, and she was scared of the thunder  and lightning. That's every word of sense I could get outa her. She  ain't altogether ignorant--she knows how to climb on a horse, anyway,  and she kicked about having to ride sideways on account of her skirts.  She was plumb out of her head, and talked wild, but she handled her  reins like a rider. And she never mentioned Bob, nor anybody else  excepting some fellow she called Charlie. She thought I was him, but she  only talked to me friendly. She didn't pull any love talk at all.\"    \"Charlie?\" Pop ruminated over a fresh quid of tobacco. \"Charlie! Mebby  Bob, he stakes himself to a different name now and then. There ain't any  Charlie, except Charlie Werner; she wouldn't mean him, do yuh s'pose?\"    \"Charlie Werner? Hunh! Say, Pop, she ain't no squaw--is she, Loney?\" Sid  Sterling remonstrated.    \"If I can read brands,\" Lone testified, \"she's no girl of Bob's. She's  a good, honest girl when she ain't crazy.\"    \"And no good, honest girl who is not crazy could possibly be a girl of  mine! Is that the idea, Lone?\"    Lone turned unhurriedly and looked at young Bob Warfield standing in the  stable door with his hands in his trousers pockets and his pipe in his  mouth.    \"That ain't the argument. Pop, here, was wondering if she was another  heart-ballum girl of yours,\" Lone grinned unabashed. \"I don't know such  a hell of a lot about heart-balm ladies, Bob. I ain't a millionaire. I'm  just making a guess at their brand--and it ain't the brand this little  lady carries.\"    Bob removed one hand from his pocket and cuddled the bowl of his pipe.  \"If she's a woman, she's a heart-balmer if she gets the chance. They all  are, down deep in their tricky hearts. There isn't a woman on earth that  won't sell a man's soul out of his body if she happens to think it's  worth her while--and she can get away with it. But don't for any sake  call her _my_ heart-balmer.\"    \"That was Pop,\" drawled Lone. \"It don't strike me as being any subject  for you fellows to make remarks about, anyway,\" he advised Pop firmly.  \"She's a right nice little girl, and she's pretty darn sick.\" He touched  John Doe with the spurs and rode away, stopping at the foreman's gate to  finish his business with Hawkins. He was a conscientious young man, and  since he had charge of Elk Spring camp, he set its interests above his  own, which was more than some of the Sawtooth men would have done in his  place.    Having reported the damage to the bridge and made his suggestions about  the repairs, he touched up John Doe again and loped away on a purely  personal matter, which had to do with finding the bag which the girl had  told him was under a bush where a rabbit had been sitting.    If she had not been so very sick, Lone would have laughed at her naive  method of identifying the spot. But he was too sorry for her to be  amused at the vagaries of her sick brain. He did not believe anything  she had said, except that she had been coming to the ranch and had left  her bag under a bush beside the road. It should not be difficult to find  it, if he followed the road and watched closely the bushes on either  side.    Until he reached the place where he had first sighted her, Lone rode  swiftly, anxious to be through with the business and go his way. But  when he came upon her footprints again, he pulled up and held John Doe  to a walk, scanning each bush and boulder as he passed.    It seemed probable that she had left the grip at Rock City where she  must have spent the night. She had spoken of being deceived into  thinking the place was the Sawtooth ranch until she had come into it and  found it \"just rocks.\" Then, he reasoned, the storm had broken, and her  fright had held her there. When daylight came she had either forgotten  the bag or had left it deliberately.    At Rock City, then, Lone stopped to examine the base of every rock, even  riding around those nearest the road. The girl, he guessed shrewdly, had  not wandered off the main highway, else she would not have been able to  find it again. Rock City was confusing unless one was perfectly familiar  with its curious, winding lanes.    It was when he was riding slowly around the boulder marked \"Palace  Hotel, Rates Reasnible,\" that he came upon the place where a horse had  stood, on the side best sheltered from the storm. Deep hoof marks  closely overlapping, an over-turned stone here and there gave proof  enough, and the rain-beaten soil that blurred the hoofprints farthest  from the rock told him more. Lone backed away, dismounted, and, stepping  carefully, went close. He could see no reason why a horse should have  stood there with his head toward the road ten feet away, unless his  rider was waiting for something--or some one. There were other boulders  near which offered more shelter from rain.    Next the rock he discovered a boot track, evidently made when the rider  dismounted. He thought of the wild statement of the girl about seeing  some one shoot a man and wondered briefly if there could be a basis of  truth in what she said. But the road showed no sign of a struggle,  though there were, here and there, hoofprints half washed out with the  rain.    Lone went back to his horse and rode on, still looking for the bag. His  search was thorough and, being a keen-eyed young man, he discovered the  place where Lorraine had crouched down by a rock. She must have stayed  there all night, for the scuffed soil was dry where her body had rested,  and her purse, caught in the juniper bush close by, was sodden with  rain.    \"The poor little kid!\" he muttered, and with, a sudden impulse he turned  and looked toward the rock behind which the horse had stood. Help had  been that close, and she had not known it, unless----    \"If anything happened there last night, she could have seen it from  here,\" he decided, and immediately put the thought away from him.    \"But nothing happened,\" he added, \"unless maybe she saw him ride out and  go on down the road. She was out of her head and just imagined things.\"    He slipped the soaked purse into his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#6)"],[1,"he does not exhibit gratitude he does not feel it. When  the dumb man swallows a tooth he may not say much about it, but it is  all inside.\"    Since its foundation in 1887, the Inland Mission of Wanhsien has been  conducted with brave perseverance. There are, unfortunately, no  converts, but there are three hopeful \"inquirers,\" whose conversion  would be the more speedy the more likely they were to obtain employment  afterwards. They argue in this way; they say, to quote the words used by  the Rev. G. L. Mason at the Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1890, \"if  the foreign teacher will take care of our bodies, we will do him the  favour to seek the salvation of our souls.\" This question of the  employment of converts is one of the chief difficulties of the  missionary in China. \"The idea (derived from Buddhism) is universally  prevalent in China,\" says the Rev. C. W. Mateer, \"that everyone who  enters any sect should live by it.... When a Chinaman becomes a  Christian he expects to live by his Christianity.\"    One of the three inquirers was shown me; he was described as the most  advanced of the three in knowledge of the doctrine. Now I do not wish to  write unkindly, but I am compelled to say that this man was a poor,  wretched, ragged coolie, who sells the commonest gritty cakes in a  rickety stall round the corner from the mission, who can neither read  nor write, and belongs to a very humble order of blunted intelligence.  The poor fellow is the father of a little girl of three, an only child,  who is both deaf and dumb. And there is the fear that his fondness for  the little one tempts him to give hope to the missionaries that in him  they are to see the first fruit of their toil, the first in the district  to be saved by their teaching, while he nurses a vague hope that, when  the foreign teachers regard him as adequately converted, they may be  willing to restore speech and hearing to his poor little offspring. It  is a scant harvest.    After a Chinese dinner the missionary and I went for a walk into the  country. In the main street we met a troop of beggars, each with a bowl  of rice and garbage and a long stick, with a few tattered rags hanging  round his loins--they were the poorest poor I had ever seen. They were  the beggars of the city, who had just received their midday meal at the  \"Wanhsien Ragged Homes.\" There are three institutions of the kind in the  city for the relief of the destitute; they are entirely supported by  charity, and are said to have an average annual income of 40,000 taels.  Wanhsien is a very rich city, with wealthy merchants and great salt  hongs. The landed gentry and the great junk owners have their town  houses here. The money distributed by the townspeople in private charity  is unusually great even for a Chinese city. Its most public-spirited  citizen is Ch'en, one of the merchant princes of China whose  transactions are confined exclusively to the products of his own  country. Starting life with an income of one hundred taels, bequeathed  him by his father, Ch'en has now agents all over the empire, and  mercantile dealings which are believed to yield him a clear annual  income of a quarter of a million taels. His probity is a by-word; his  benefactions have enriched the province. That cutting in the face of the  cliff in the Feng-hsiang Gorge near Kweichou-fu, where a pathway for  trackers has been hewn out of the solid rock, was done at his expense,  and is said to have cost one hundred thousand taels. Not only by his  benefactions has Ch'en laid up for himself merit in heaven, but he has  already had his reward in this world. His son presented himself for the  M.A. examination for the Hanlin degree, the highest academical degree in  the Empire. Everyone in China knows that success in this examination is  dependent upon the favour of Wunchang-te-keun, the god of literature  (Taoist) \"who from generation to generation hath sent his miraculous  influence down upon earth\", and, as the god had seen with approbation  the good works done by the father, he gave success to the son. When the  son returned home after his good fortune, he was met beyond the walls  and escorted into the city with royal honours; his success was a triumph  for the city which gave him birth.    A short walk and we were out of the city, following a flagged path with  flights of steps winding up the hill through levelled terraces rich with  every kind of cereal, and with abundance of poppy. Splendid views of one  of the richest agricultural regions in the world are here unfolded. Away  down in the valley is the palatial family mansion of Pien, one of the  wealthiest yeomen in the province. Beyond you see the commencement of  the high road, a paved causeway eight feet wide, which extends for  hundreds of miles to Chentu, the capital of the province, and takes rank  as the finest work of its kind in the empire. On every hill-top is a  fort. That bolder than the rest commanding the city at a distance of  five miles, is on the \"Hill of Heavenly Birth.\" It was built, says  Hobson, during the Taiping Rebellion; it existed, says the missionary,  before the present dynasty; discrepant statements characteristic of this  country of contradictions. But, whether thirty or two hundred and fifty  years old, the fort is now one in name only, and is at present occupied  by a garrison of peaceful peasantry.    Chinamen that we met asked us politely \"if we had eaten our rice,\" and  \"whither were we going.\" We answered correctly. But when with equal  politeness we asked the wayfarer where he was going, he jerked his chin  towards the horizon and said, \"a long way.\"    We called at the residence of a rich young Chinese, who had lately  received it in his inheritance, together with 3000 acres of farmland,  which, we were told, yield him an annual income of 70,000 taels. In the  absence of the master, who was away in the country reading with his  tutor for the Hanlin degree, we were received by the caretakers, who  showed us the handsome guest chambers, the splendid gilded tablet, the  large courts, and garden rockeries. A handsome residence is this,  solidly built of wood and masonry, and with the trellis work carved with  much elaboration.    It was late when we returned to the mission, and after dark when I went  on board my little wupan. My boys had not been idle. They had bought new  provisions of excellent quality, and had made the boat much more  comfortable. The three kind missionaries came down to wish me Godspeed.  Brave men! they deserve a kinder fortune than has been their fate  hitherto. We crossed the river and anchored above the city, ready  against an early start in the morning.    The day after leaving Wanhsien was the first time that we required any  assistance on our journey from another junk; it was cheerfully given.  Our towrope had chafed through, and we were in a difficulty, attempting  to pass a bad rapid among the rocks, when a large junk was hauled bodily  past us, and, seeing our plight, hooked on to us and towed us with them  out of danger. On this night we anchored under the Sentinel Rock  (Shih-pao-chai), perhaps the most remarkable landmark on the river. From  two hundred to three hundred feet high, and sixty feet wide at the base,  it is a detached rock, cleft vertically from a former cliff. A  nine-storied pagoda has been inset into the south-eastern face, and  temple buildings crown the summit.    It was surprising how well my men lived on board the boat. They had  three good meals a day, always with rice and abundance of vegetables,  and frequently with a little pork. Cooking was done while we were under  way; for the purpose we had two little earthenware stoves, two pans, and  a kettle. All along the river cabbages and turnips are abundant and  cheap. Bumboats, laden to the rail, waylay the boats _en route_, and  offer an armful of fresh vegetables for the equivalent in copper cash of  three-eighths of a penny. Other boats peddle firewood, cut short and  bound in little bundles, and sticks of charcoal. Coal is everywhere  abundant, and there are excellent briquettes for sale, made of a mixture  of clay and coal-dust.    All day long now for the rest of our voyage we sailed through a  beautiful country. From the hill tops to the water's edge the hillsides  are levelled into a succession of terraces; there are cereals and the  universal poppy, pretty hamlets, and thriving little villages; a river  half a mile wide thronged with every kind of river craft, and back in  the distance snow-clad mountains. There are bamboo sheds at every point,  with coils of bamboo towrope, mats, and baskets, and huge Szechuen hats  as wide as an umbrella.    On the morning of March 5th I was awakened by loud screaming and yelling  ahead of us. I squeezed out of my cabin, and saw a huge junk looming  down upon us. In an awkward rapid its towline had parted, and the huge  structure tumbling uncontrolled in the water, was bearing down on us,  broadside on. It seemed as if we should be crushed against the rocks,  and we must have been, but for the marvellous skill with which the  sailors on the junk, just at the critical time, swung their vessel out  of danger. They were yelling with discord, but worked together as one  man.    In the afternoon we were at Feng-tu-hsien, a flourishing river port, one  of the principal outlets of the opium traffic of the Upper Yangtse. Next  day we were at Fuchou, the other opium port, whose trade in opium is  greater still than that of Feng-tu-hsien. It is at the junction of a  large tributary--the Kung-t'-an-ho, which is navigable for large vessels  for more than two hundred miles. Large numbers of the Fuchou junks were  moored here, which differ in construction from all other junks on the  river Yangtse in having their great sterns twisted or wrung a quarter  round to starboard, and in being steered by an immense stern sweep, and  not by the balanced rudder of an ordinary "]]]
