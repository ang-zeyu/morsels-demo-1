The Robin flew up to him and said, \"Well done, brother! You have  succeeded. Now give me the fire and I will relieve you while you drop  into the lake below us to quench the flame which threatens your life.\"    So the Robin in his turn seized the firebrand in his beak and started  down with it. But, like the Wren, he too was soon fluttering in the  blaze of his own burning plumage, a little living firework, falling  toward the earth.    Then up came the Lark, who had been watching the two unselfish birds.  \"Give me the brand, brother Robin,\" she cried, \"for your pretty feathers  are all ablaze and your life is in danger.\"    So it was the Lark who finally brought the fire safely to the earth and  gave it to mankind. But the Robin and the Wren, when they had put out  the flame which burned their feathers, appeared in the assembly of the  birds, and were greeted with great applause as the heroes of the day.  The Robin's breast was scorched a brilliant red, but the poor, brave  little Wren was wholly bare of plumage. All his pretty feathers had been  burned away, and he stood before them shivering and piteous.    \"Bravo! little Wren,\" cried King Eagle. \"A noble deed you have done this  day, and nobly have you won back the respect of your brother birds and  earned the everlasting gratitude of men. Now what shall we do to help  you in your sorry plight?\" After a moment's thought he turned to the  other birds and said, \"Who will give a feather to help patch a covering  for our brave friend?\"    \"I!\" and \"I!\" and \"I!\" and \"I!\" chorused the generous birds. And in turn  each came forward with a plume or a bit of down from his breast. The  Robin first, who had shared his peril, brought a feather sadly scorched,  but precious; the Lark next, who had helped in the time of need. The  Eagle bestowed a kingly feather, the Thrush, the Nightingale,--every  bird contributed except the Owl.    But the selfish Owl said, \"I see no reason why I should give a feather.  Hoot! No! The Wren brought me into trouble once, and I will not help him  now. Let him go bare, for all my aid.\"    \"Shame! Shame!\" cried the birds indignantly. \"Old Master Owl, you ought  to be ashamed. But if you are so selfish we will not have you in our  society. Go back to your hollow tree!\"    \"Yes, go back to your hollow tree,\" cried the Eagle sternly; \"and when  winter comes may you shiver with cold as you would have left the brave  little Wren to shiver this day. You shall ruffle your feathers as much  as you like, but you will always feel cold at heart, because your heart  is selfish.\"    And indeed, since that day for all his feathers the Owl has never been  able to keep warm enough in his lonely hollow tree.    But the Wren became one of the happiest of all the birds, and a favorite  both with his feathered brothers and with men, because of his brave  deed, and because of the great fire-gift which he had brought from the  sun.          HOW THE BLUEBIRD CROSSED      Of course every one knows that the Bluebird was made from a piece of the  azure sky itself. One has only to match his wonderful color against the  April heaven to be sure of that. Therefore the little Bluebird was  especially dear to the Spirit of the sky, the Father in Heaven.    One day this venturesome little bird started out upon a long journey  across the wide Pacific Ocean toward this New World which neither  Columbus nor any other man had yet discovered. Under him tossed the  wide, wide sea, rolling for miles in every direction, with no land  visible anywhere on which a little bird might rest his foot. For this  was also before there were any islands in all that stretch of waters.  Soon the poor little Bluebird became very weary and wished he had not  ventured upon so long a flight. His wings began to droop and he sank  lower and lower toward the sea which seemed eager to overwhelm his  blueness with its own. He had come so far over the salty wastes that he  was very thirsty; but with water, water everywhere there was not a drop  to drink. The poor little bird glanced despairingly up toward the blue  sky from which he had been made and cried,--    \"O Spirit of the blue sky, O my Father in Heaven, help your child the  Bluebird! Give me, I pray you, a place to rest and refreshment for my  thirsty throat, or I perish in the cruel blue waters!\"    At these sorrowful words the kind Father took pity upon his little  Bluebird. And what do you think? He made a baby earthquake which heaved  a rocky point of land up through the waves, just big enough for a little  bird's perch. It was a tiny reef, and a crack in the rock held but a few  drops of the rain which began to fall; but it meant at least a moment's  safety and draught of life for the weary bird, and glad enough he was to  reach it.    He had not been there long, however, when a big wave almost washed him  away. He was not yet safe. Still he lacked the rest and refreshment  which he so sorely needed. For the raindrops were soon turned brackish  by the waves which dashed upon the reef from all sides, and the Bluebird  had to keep hopping up and down to avoid being drowned in the tossing  spray. He was more tired than ever, and this continuous exercise made  him even more thirsty. Once more he prayed to the Father for help. And  once more the kind Spirit of the Sky heard him from the blueness.    This time there was a terrible earthquake, until the sea boiled and  rolled into huge waves as if churned by a mighty churn at the very  bottom of things, and with a terrified scream the Bluebird flew high  into the air.    But when the noise and the rumbling died away and once more the sea lay  calm and still, what do you think the Bluebird saw? The great ocean  which had once stretched an unbroken sheet of blue as far as the eye  could see was now dotted here and there by islands, big islands and  little islands, groups and archipelagoes of them, just as on the map one  sees them to-day peppering the Pacific Ocean. Samoa came up, and Tonga,  and Tulima, and many others with names quite as bad, if not worse. From  one island to another the Bluebird flew, finding rest and refreshment on  each, until he reached the mainland in safety. And there the islands  remain to this day for other travelers to visit, breaking their journey  from west to east or from east to west. There are forests and cascades,  springs of fresh and pleasant water, delicious fruits, wonderful birds  and animals, and finally a race of strange, dark men. (But they came  long, long after.)    So the Bluebird crossed the Pacific, folk tell. Was it not wonderful how  the kind Father came to scatter those many islands in the Pacific  Ocean,--stepping-stones for a tiny little Bluebird so that he need not  wet his feet in crossing that wide salty river?          THE PEACOCK'S COUSIN      Long, long ago in the days of wise King Solomon, the Crow and the  Pheasant were the best of friends, and were always seen going about  together, wing in wing. Now the Pheasant was the Peacock's own  cousin,--a great honor, many thought, for the Peacock was the most  gorgeous of all the birds. But it was not altogether pleasant for the  Pheasant, because at that time he wore such plain and shabby old  garments that his proud relative was ashamed of him, and did not like to  be reminded that they were of the same family. When the Peacock went  strutting about with his wonderful tail spread fan-wise, and with his  vain little eyes peering to see who might be admiring his beauty, the  Peacock's cousin and his friend the Crow, who was then a plain _white_  bird, would slink aside and hide behind a tree, whence they would peep  enviously until the Peacock had passed by. Then the Peacock's cousin  would say,--    \"Oh, how beautiful, how grand, how noble he is! How came such a lordly  bird to have for a cousin so homely a creature as I?\"    But the Crow would answer, trying to comfort his friend, \"Yes, he is  gorgeous. But listen, what a harsh and disagreeable voice he has! And  see how vain he is. I would not be so vain had I so scandalous a tale in  my family history.\"    Then the Crow told the Peacock's cousin how his proud relative came to  have so unmusical a voice.           *       *       *       *       *    When Adam and Eve were living peacefully in their fair garden, while  Satan was still seeking in vain a way to enter there, the Peacock was  the most beautiful of all the companions who surrounded the happy pair.  His plumage shone like pearl and emerald, and his voice was so melodious  that he was selected to sing the Lord's praises every day in the streets  of heaven. But he was then, as now, very, very vain; and Satan, prowling  about outside the wall of Paradise, saw this.    \"Aha!\" he said to himself, \"here is the vainest creature in all the  world. He is the one I must flatter in order to win entrance to the  garden, where I am to work my mischief. Let me approach the Peacock.\"    Satan stole softly to the gate and in a wheedling voice called to the  Peacock,--    \"O most wonderful and beautiful bird! Are you one of the birds of  Paradise?\"    \"Yes, I am one of the dwellers in the happy garden,\" answered the  Peacock, strutting. \"But who are you who slink about so secretly, as if  afraid of some one?\"    \"I am one of the cherubim who are appointed to sing the Lord's praises,\"  answered the wicked Satan. \"I have stopped for a moment to visit the  Paradise which He has prepared for the blest, and I find as my first  glimpse of its glories you, O most lovely bird! Will you conceal me  under your rainbow wings and bring me within the walls?\"    \"I dare not,\" answered the Peacock. \"The Lord allows none to enter here.  He will be angry and will punish me.\"    \"O charming bird!\" went on Satan with his smooth tongue, \"take me with  you, and I will teach you three mysterious "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#6)"],[1,"north-eastward, and there burst upon my sight a most enchanting view. In  the far east, that is, some twenty or five-and-twenty miles away,  stretched a lofty chain of mountains, flat-topped and so regular in their  outline that they appeared rather the work of art than of nature. Between  this range and the nearest one lay a large rich valley vying with the  most fertile I have ever seen in an extra-tropical country. In front of  us lay another valley which drained a portion of the large one, and in  both rose gently swelling hills and picturesque peaks, wooded in the most  romantic manner. Whilst I stood and looked on this scene, my woes were  forgotten. Such moments as these repay an explorer for much toil and  trouble.    THE VICTORIA RANGE AND DISTRICT. THE PROVINCE OF VICTORIA.    The distant range I at once named the Victoria in honour of Her Majesty;  and being now certain that the district we were in was one of the most  fertile in Australia I named it the Province of Victoria. There is no  other part of extra-tropical Australia which can boast of the same number  of streams in an equal extent of coast frontage, or which has such  elevated land so near the sea; and I have seen no other which has so  large an extent of good country. It is however bounded both to the north  and south by comparatively-speaking unproductive districts; but what the  character of the country to the north-east and south-east may be still  remains to be ascertained.    Another mile on a course of 180 degrees brought us to the valley in our  front; it was of the same rich and romantic character as that which I  have just described, being in depth about two hundred feet, down  limestone rocks, in places assuming the character of cliffs. In its  bottom was a watercourse containing water in pools only; but it must be  borne in mind that it was now the very end of the dry season. The party  all came up, and we laid ourselves down under the grateful shade of the  mimosas. Those who chose took their fill of water. I had made a rule  never to taste it except to wash out my mouth from sunrise until we  halted for the night; for I found that drinking water promoted profuse  perspiration and more ardent thirst, and I preferred practising a little  self-denial to enduring the greater pangs arising from indulgence.    Whilst I stretched my weary length along under the pleasant shade I saw  in fancy busy crowds throng the scenes I was then amongst. I pictured to  myself the bleating sheep and lowing herds wandering over these fertile  hills; and I chose the very spot on which my house should stand,  surrounded with as fine an amphitheatre of verdant land as the eye of man  has ever gazed on. The view was backed by the Victoria Range, whilst  seaward you looked out through a romantic glen upon the great Indian  Ocean. I knew that within four or five years civilization would have  followed my tracks, and that rude nature and the savage would no longer  reign supreme over so fine a territory. Mr. Smith entered eagerly into my  thoughts and views: together we built these castles in the air, trusting  we should see happy results spring from our present sufferings and  labours, but within a few weeks from this day he died in the wilds he was  exploring.    THE BULLER RIVER.    The stream we were on I named the Buller; we rested some time by it and  when we moved on some of the advocates of the eight or ten mile a day  system very unwillingly followed the party. We fell in with a native path  which wound up through a thick scrub in pleasing sinuosities, and emerged  upon a tableland similar to the one we had traversed this morning.    THE CHAPMAN RIVER.    I now followed a course of 169 degrees, and after walking three miles  more we arrived at the edge of a valley of the same character as that  wherein the Buller flowed, and through it we had another view of the  fertile country to the eastward: into this valley we descended and,  finding a watercourse running through it with water in pools, I seated  myself with such of the party as were up, about half a quarter of a mile  from the Mount Fairfax of Captain King, and named this stream the  Chapman.    SEARCH FOR A MISSING MAN.    Mr. Walker now came up with the remainder of the party and reported that  Stiles was missing. As he could have no difficulty in finding us I merely  took the precaution to make the men sit in such positions that he could  distinguish us from the summit of the opposite cliffs when he arrived  there, and we patiently awaited that moment. Time however wore on, and  some of the men finding a species of geranium with a root not unlike a  very small and tough parsnip, we prepared and ate several messes of this  plant. At length, no signs of Stiles having been seen, I sent Mr. Walker,  Corporal Auger, and Kaiber to the top of the cliffs we had descended to  try if they could discern anything of him or his tracks. During their  absence I expressed, in the hearing of some of the men, my anxiety lest  he should have lingered behind and have fallen in with the natives; upon  which they smiled and said that \"Tom Stiles was a man who did not care  about the natives; and that only that morning he had said he didn't mind  for all the natives in the island, d--- them;\" and that they thought he  had stopped behind on purpose.    GATHERING OF NATIVES. SCENE WITH NATIVES.    The absence of Mr. Walker and his party continued much longer than I  expected, and just at the moment that I had become rather alarmed about  it Coles reported to me that he saw natives on the opposite cliff,  jumping about and running up and down brandishing their spears in the  manner they do before and after a fight. Coles was at this time posted as  sentry on a terrace just above where we were, and the ascent to which was  very difficult. I got up on this as fast as I could; it was only two or  three yards broad and ran apparently along the whole length of the  valley. The natives used it as a path, and a very steep hill rose behind  it. I could not however make out the natives, and as the opposite cliffs  were a long way off I thought that Coles might have been mistaken. When I  told him this he merely said \"Look there, then, Sir,\" and pointed to the  top of Mount Fairfax, distant about 400 yards due north of us, and sure  enough there were a party of natives, well armed and going through a  variety of ceremonies which the experience of centuries had proved to be  highly efficacious in getting rid of evil spirits. In the present  instance however their wonted efficacy failed, but the natives appeared  every moment to be getting more vehement in their gestures.    Our situation by no means pleased me: Stiles and a separate party of our  own men had mysteriously disappeared in the direction where Coles had  first seen the natives, by whom we were in a manner surrounded, and that  in an abominable position, for they could steal amongst the underwood  close above us in our rear, and annoy us with missiles of all sorts;  whilst from the extent and thickness of the scrub it was impossible to  occupy it effectually against treacherous (or rather, bold and skilful)  enemies. On the other hand I could not quit my present position and  occupy a more favourable one, for, in the event of Mr. Walker and  Corporal Auger being pressed by the natives and retreating on us, it was  our duty to be at that spot where they would calculate on finding us and  an effectual assistance. I made therefore the best disposition of my  little force I could, and, occupying the centre of the party, I had the  satisfaction of seeing our wild friends on Mount Fairfax, blowing  strongly at us and capering more furiously than ever when they beheld our  unaccountable manoeuvres.    THEIR MANOEUVRES.    It was fortunate that poor Kaiber was absent, for so fearful an  exhibition of sorcery would have altogether upset his nerves; but the  British soldiers and sailors I had with me remained surprisingly calm;  whilst the natives, having exhibited their antics for a few minutes more,  suddenly withdrew in a hurried manner. I therefore made up my mind for a  surprise, and we anxiously waited to see from what quarter the attack  would come.    CONTINUATION OF SEARCH FOR THE MISSING MAN. RETURN OF PARTY FROM SEARCH.    The cause of their disappearance was however soon explained. Mr. Walker,  Corporal Auger, and Kaiber came winding down the hills under Mount  Fairfax, and gave the following account of their proceedings: On  ascending the cliffs opposite to us they had found Stiles's tracks, and  had followed them until they reached the sea beach; on passing the stream  on their way there they found a place where he had halted and made up all  his flour into dampers; but on coming out on the shore they saw a large  party of natives seated on the sandhills in front, whilst others were  fishing in the sea at this point; and the tracks of Stiles turned off  into the interior: this hero, who wished to encounter all the natives of  the island single-handed, had evidently fled from them. Mr. Walker had  been unable to follow his tracks any further and had therefore thought it  most prudent to return to the main party.    From the circumstances of Stiles having thrown away part of his clothes,  and having made such a large quantity of dough to bake into dampers at  the first convenient opportunity, together with various expressions he  had dropped in the presence of the men, there could be no doubt but that  he had purposely quitted the party; yet to abandon him to his fate  amongst natives, who were by no means friendly in their gestures and  appearance, required a degree of resolution I was unprepared at that  moment to exercise. To leave him without a search was to sacrifice one  life, to allow one man to perish, whilst occupying one or two days in  looking for him would merely increase the temporary sufferings of the  rest; whilst the loss of time would"]]]
