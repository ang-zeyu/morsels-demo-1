One might compare the  buildings at Castlefield, Finkley, and Holbury, which I have discussed  in the _Victoria History of Hants_ (i. 302-3, 312), and which were  perhaps rudimentary forms of the Carisbrooke type.    [Footnote 7: It has been styled the 'basilical' type, but few names  could be less suitable.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14. FARM-HOUSE AT CLANVILLE, KENT (To illustrate  Fig. 13)]    (xxii) A few kindred items may be grouped here. Digging has been  attempted in a Roman 'villa' at Litlington (Cambs.) but, as Prof.  McKenny Hughes tells me, with little success. The 'beautifully tiled  and marbled floors' are newspaper exaggeration. A 'Roman bath' which  was stated to have been found early in 1914 at Kingston-on-Thames,  in the work of widening the bridge, is declared by Mr. Mill Stephenson  not to be Roman at all. Lastly, an excavation of an undoubted Roman  house at Broom Farm, between Hambledon and Soberton in south-east Hants,  projected by Mr. A. Moray Williams, was prevented by the war, which  called Mr. Williams to serve his country.    (xxiii) _Lowbury._ During the early summer of 1914 Mr. D. Atkinson  completed his examination of the interesting site of Lowbury, high amid  the east Berkshire Downs. Of the results which he won in 1913 I gave  some account last year (Report for 1913, p. 22); those of 1914 confirm  and develop them. We may, then, accept the site as, at first and during  the Middle Empire, a summer farm or herdsmen's shelter, and in the  latest Roman days a refuge from invading English. Whether the wall which  he traced round the little place was reared to keep in cattle or to keep  out foes, is not clear; possibly enough, it served both uses. In all,  Mr. Atkinson gathered about 850 coins belonging to all periods of the  Empire but especially to the latest fourth century and including  Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius. He also found over fifty brooches  and a great amount of pottery--3 cwt., he tells me--which was mostly  rough ware: there was little Samian (some of shape '37'), less Castor,  and hardly any traces of mortaria. A notable find was the skeleton of  a woman of 50 (ht. about 5 feet 9 inches), which he discovered in the  trench dug to receive the foundations of the enclosing wall; it lay in  the line of the foundations amidst the perished cement of the wall, and  its associations and position forbid us to think either that it was  buried before the wall was thought of or was inserted after the wall was  ruined. Mr. Atkinson formed the theory--with natural hesitation--that  it might be a foundation burial, and I understand that Sir Jas. Frazer  accepts this suggestion. A full report of the whole work will shortly  be issued in the Reading College Research Series.    (xxiv) _Eastbourne, Beachy Head._ The Rev. W. Budgen, of Eastbourne,  tells me of a hoard of 540 coins found in 1914 in a coombe near Bullock  Down, just behind Beachy Head. The coins range from Valerian (1 coin)  to Quintillus (4 coins) and Probus (1 coin); 69 are attributed to  Gallienus, 88 to Victorinus, 197 to the Tetrici, and 40 to Claudius  Gothicus ; the hoard may have been buried about A.D. 280, but it has to  be added that 130 coins have not been yet identified. Hoards of somewhat  this date are exceedingly common; in 1901 I published accounts of two  such hoards detected, shortly before that, at points quite close to the  findspot of the present hoard (see _Sussex Archaeological Collections_,  xliv, pp. 1-8).    Mr. Budgen has also sent me photographs of some early cinerary urns  and a 'Gaulish' fibula, found together in Eastbourne in 1914. The  things may belong to the middle of the first century A.D. The 'Gaulish'  type of fibula has been discussed and figured by Sir Arthur Evans  (_Archaeologia_, lv. 188-9, fig. 10; see also Dressel's note in _Bonner  Jahrbuecher_, lxiv. 82). Its home appears to be Gaul. In Britain it  occurs rather infrequently; east of the Rhine it is still rarer; it  shows only one vestige of itself at Haltern and is wholly absent from  Hofheim and the Saalburg. Its date appears to be the first century A.D.,  and perhaps rather the earlier two-thirds than the end of that period.    (xxv) _Parc-y-Meirch_ (_North Wales_). Here Mr. Willoughby Gardner has  further continued his valuable excavations (Report for 1913, p. 25).  The new coin-finds seem to hint that the later fourth-century stratum  may have been occupied earlier in that century than the date which I  gave last year, A.D. 340. But the siege of this hill-fort is bound to  be long and its full results will not be clear till the end. Then we  may expect it to throw real light on an obscure corner of the history  of Roman and also post-Roman Wales.          B. ROMAN INSCRIPTIONS FOUND IN BRITAIN IN 1914      This section includes the Roman inscriptions which have been found, or  (perhaps I should say) first recognized to exist, in Britain in 1914  or which have become more accurately known in that year. As in 1913,  the list is short and its items are not of great importance; but the  Chesterholm altar (No. 5) deserves note, and the Corbridge tile also  possesses considerable interest.    I have edited them in the usual manner, first stating the origin,  character, &c., of the inscription, then giving its text with a  rendering in English, thirdly adding any needful notes and acknowledging  obligations to those who may have communicated the items to me.  In the expansions of the text, square brackets denote letters which,  owing to breakage or other cause, are not now on the stone, though one  may presume that they were originally there; round brackets denote  expansions of Roman abbreviations. The inscriptions are printed in  the same order as the finds in section A, that is, from north to  south--though with so few items the order hardly matters.    (1) Found at Balmuildy (above, p. 7) in the annexe to the south-east of  the fort proper, some sandstone fragments from the top of a small altar,  originally perhaps about 14 inches wide. At the top, in a semicircular  panel is a rude head; below are letters from the first two lines of the  dedication; probably the first line had originally four letters:--    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    Possibly DIO may be for _deo_. It is by no means a common orthography,  but if it be accepted, we can read _dio [s(ancto) Ma]rti_.... The  reading DIIO, _deo_, is I fear impossible.    I have to thank Mr. S. N. Miller, the excavator, for photographs.    (2) At Traprain Law (above, p. 8) a small potsherd from a second-century  level bore the letters scratched on it          I R I /      These letters were on the side of the potsherd which had formed the  inner surface when the pot was whole; they must therefore have been  inscribed after the pot had been smashed, and the size and shape of the  bit give cause to think that it may have been broken intentionally for  inscription--possibly for use in some game. In any case, it must have  been inscribed at Traprain Law, and not brought there already written,  and the occurrence of writing of any sort on such a site is noteworthy.    I am indebted to Dr. G. Macdonald for a sight of the piece.    (3) Found about three and a half miles north of the Roman fort  Bremenium, High Rochester, near Horsley in north Northumberland, beside  the Roman road over the Cheviots (Dere Street), close to the steading of  Featherwood, in the autumn of 1914, now in the porch of Horsley Parish  Church, a plain altar 51 inches high by 22 inches wide, with six lines  of letters 2 inches tall. The inscription is unusually illegible. Only  the first and last lines are readable with certainty; elsewhere some  letters can be read or guessed, but not so as to yield coherent sense.          VICTORIAE          (only bottom of final E visible)      ET....IVL          (ET probable, IVL fairly certain)      MEIANIC            (only M quite certain)      II........C        (erased on purpose)      PVBLICO      V . S . L _m_      The altar was dedicated to Victory; nothing else is certain. It is  tempting to conjecture in line 2 ET N AVG, _et numinibus Augustorum_, as  on some other altars to Victory, but ET is not certain, though probable,  and N AVG is definitely improbable. The fourth line seems to have been  intentionally erased. I find no sign of any mention of the Cohors I  Vardullorum, which garrisoned Bremenium, though it or its commander  might naturally be concerned in putting up such an altar.    We may assume that the altar belongs to Bremenium; possibly it was  brought thence when Featherwood was built.    I have to thank the Rev. Thos. Stephens, vicar of Horsley, for  photographs and an excellent squeeze and readings, and Mr. R. Blair for  a photograph.    (4-5) Found on July 17, 1914, at Chesterholm, just south of Hadrian's  Wall, lying immediately underneath the surface in a grass field 120  yards west of the fort, two altars:    (4) 32 inches tall, 15 inches broad, illegible save for the first line          IOM      _I(ovi) o(ptimo) m(aximo)_....    (5) 34 inches tall, 22 inches broad, with 8 lines of rather irregular  letters, not quite legible at the end (fig. 16).    [Illustration: FIG. 16. ALTAR FROM CHESTERHOLM]    _Pro domu divina et numinibus Augustorum, Volcano sacrum, vicani  Vindolandesses, cu[r(am)] agente ... v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens)  m(erito)_.    'For the Divine (i.e. Imperial) House and the Divinity of the Emperors,  dedicated to Vulcan by the members of the _vicus_ of Vindolanda, under  the care of ... (name illegible).'    The statement of the reason for the dedication given in the first three  lines is strictly tautologous, the Divine House and the Divinity of the  Emperors being practically the same thing. The formula _numinibus Aug._  is very common in Britain, though somewhat rare elsewhere; in other  provinces its place is supplied by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#6)"],[1," shows itself, the tone must sound right; for then the mass  of the tongue is kept away from the throat, and, since its sides are  raised, it is kept out of the way of the tone.    [Illustration: Side of the tongue kept high.    Furrow.]    [Illustration: Red line denotes:    Sensation in raising the soft palate for high notes.    Sensation of the form in rapid upward passages.    Division of the breath favors the resonance of head cavities.]    It lies flattest in the lowest tones because the larynx then is in  a very low position, and thus is out of its way.    [Illustration: Red line denotes sensation of the form in slow  progression of tones.]    [Illustration: Red line denotes sensation for the propagation form.]    Furthermore, there is the unconstrained position of the larynx, which  must be maintained without pressure of the throat muscles. From it the  breath must stream forth evenly and uninterruptedly, to fill the form  prepared for it by the tongue and palate and supported by the throat  muscles.    This support must not, however, depend in the least upon  _pressure_,--for the vibrating breath must float above,--but upon the  greatest elasticity. One must play with the muscles, and be able to  contract and relax them at pleasure, having thus perfect mastery over  them. For this incessant practice is required, increasing control of  the breath through the sense of hearing and the breath pressure.    At first a very strong will power is needed to hold the muscles tense  without pressure; that is, to let the tone, as it were, soar through  the throat, mouth, or cavities of the head.    The stronger the improper pressure in the production of the tone, the  more difficult it is to get rid of. The result is simply, in other  words, a strain. The contraction of the muscles must go only so far  that they can be slowly relaxed; that is, can return to their normal  position _easily_. Never must the neck be swelled up, or the veins in  it stand out. Every convulsive or painful feeling is wrong.          SECTION VI    THE ATTACK      To attack a tone, the breath must be directed to a focal point on the  palate, which lies under the critical point for each different tone;  this must be done with a certain decisiveness. There must, however, be  no pressure on this place; for the overtones must be able to soar  above, and sound with, the tone. The palate has to furnish, besides,  the top cover against which the breath strikes, also an extremely  elastic floor for the breath sounding above it against the hard palate  or in the nose.    This breath, by forming the overtones, makes certain the connection  with the resonance of the head cavities.    In order to bring out the color of the tone the whirling currents must  vivify all the vowel sounds that enter into it, and draw them into  their circles with an ever-increasing, soaring tide of sound.    The duration of the tone must be assured by the gentle but  uninterrupted outpouring of the breath behind it. Its strength must be  gained by the breath pressure and the focal point on the palate, by  the complete utilization of the palatal resonance; without, however,  injuring the resonance of the head cavities. (See plate, representing  the attack.)    [Illustration: Sensation of pitch.    Red line denotes sensation in the attack.]          SECTION VII    NASAL. NASAL SINGING      By raising the back of the tongue toward the soft palate and lowering  the soft palate toward the tongue, we produce nasal sound, such as is  heard in the pronunciation of the word \"hanger,\" for instance. The air  is then expelled chiefly through the nose. The nasal sound can be much  exaggerated--something that very rarely happens; it can be much  neglected--something that very often happens. Certain it is that it is  not nearly enough availed of. That is my own everyday experience.    We Germans have only small opportunity to make the acquaintance of the  nasal sound; we know it in only a few words: \"E_ng_el,\" \"la_ng_e,\"  \"ma_ng_el,\" etc.,--always where _ng_ occurs before or after a vowel.    The French, on the contrary, always sing and speak nasally, with the  pillar of the fauces raised high, and not seldom exaggerate it. On  account of the rounding up of the whole soft palate, which, through  the power of habit, is cultivated especially by the French to an  extraordinary degree, and which affords the breath an enormous space  as a resonating surface to act upon, their voices often sound  tremendous. The tenor Silva is a good example of this. Such voices  have only the one drawback of easily becoming monotonous. At first  the power of the organ astonishes us; the next time we are  disappointed--the tone color remains always the same. The tone often  even degenerates into a hollow quality.    [Illustration: Red lines denote movement of the tongue and palate for  the nasal tone.]    On the other hand, voices that are not sufficiently nasal sound clear  and expressionless. Madame Melba, for instance, whose voice is  cultivated to favor the head tones, and sounds equally well in all its  ranges, apparently lowers the pillars of the fauces too much, and  has her chief resonance in the head cavities; she cannot draw upon the  palatal resonance for single accents of expression. Consequently she  loses in vocal color. This procedure, as soon as it becomes a habit,  results in monotony.    In the first case somewhat less, in the second somewhat more, nasal  resonance would help to a greater variety of effect.    There are singers, too, who pursue the middle path with consummate  art. Thus Madame Sembrich, in recent years, appears to have devoted  very special study to nasal tones, whereby her voice, especially in  the middle register, has gained greatly in warmth.    To fix the pupil's attention on the nasal tone and the elasticity of  the palate, he should often be given exercises with French words.          SECTION VIII    SINGING TOWARD THE NOSE. HEAD VOICE      When the peak of the softest part of the palate is placed forward  toward the nose, instead of being drawn up high behind the nose, as in  the head voice (see plate, head voice and nasal tone), it forms a kind  of nasal production which, as I have already said, cannot be studied  enough, because it produces very noble tonal effects and extraordinary  connections. It ought always to be employed. By it is effected the  connection of tones with each other, from the front teeth back to a  point under the nose; from the lower middle tones to the head tones.  In truth, all the benefit of tonal connection depends upon this  portion of the soft palate; that is, upon its conscious employment.    This is all that singers mean when they speak of \"nasal  singing\"--really only singing toward the nose. The soft palate placed  toward the nose offers a resonating surface for the tone.    The reason why teachers tell their pupils so little of this is that  many singers are quite ignorant of what nasal singing means, and are  tormented by the idea of \"singing toward the nose,\" when by chance  they hear something about it. They generally regard the voice as one  complete organ acting by itself, which is once for all what it is.  What can be made of it through knowledge of the functions of all the  cooeperating organs they know nothing of.    Blind voices are often caused by the exaggerated practice of closing  off the throat too tightly from the head cavities; that is, drawing  the pillars of the fauces too far toward the wall of the throat. The  large resonating chamber thus formed yields tones that are powerful  close at hand, but they do not carry, because they are poor in  overtones. The mistake consists in the practice of stretching the  pillars too widely in the higher vocal ranges, also. In proportion as  the pillars are extended, the breath spreads over the entire palate,  instead of being concentrated on only one point of it, and bringing at  the same time the resonance of the head cavities into play. The soft  palate must first be drawn up to, then behind, the nose, and the  attack of the higher tones be transferred thither. The pillars of the  fauces must necessarily be relaxed by this action of the soft palate.  Thereby breath is introduced into the cavities of the head to form the  overtones, which contribute brilliancy and freshness to the voice.    Many singers persist in the bad habit here described, as long as  nature can endure it; in the course of time, however, even with the  most powerful physiques, they will begin to sing noticeably flat; with  less powerful, the fatal tremolo will make its appearance, which  results in the ruin of so many singers.    [Illustration: Red lines denote vocal sensations of soprano and tenor  singers.]    [Illustration: The singer's nasal tone.    Red line denotes:    The soft palate raised high in the back, for further progression with  the head tone.    Vocal sensation.    Red line denotes:    Soft palate drawn toward the nose, for a descending progression.    Vocal sensation.]          SECTION IX    THE HEAD VOICE      The head tone signifies, for all voices, from the deepest bass to the  highest soprano,--excepting for the fact that it furnishes the  overtones for each single tone of the whole vocal gamut,--youth. A  voice without vibrancy is an _old_ voice. The magic of youth,  freshness, is given by the overtones that sound with every tone.    So to utilize the head voice (resonance of the head cavities) that  every tone shall be able to \"carry\" and shall remain high enough to  reach higher tones easily, is a difficult art, without which, however,  the singer cannot reckon upon the durability of his voice. Often  employed unconsciously, it is lost through heedlessness, mistaken  method, or ignorance; and it can hardly ever be regained, or, if at  all, only through the greatest sacrifice of time, trouble, and  patience.    The _pure_ head voice (the third register) is, on account of the  thinness"]]]
