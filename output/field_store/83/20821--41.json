All that is required is that it begin after the  lapse of one measure, i.e., when the line ends on the accent the next line  begins on the weak beat of the measure following, and if it ends on the  weak beat then on the accent of the next measure.    The interval at any hold except the last of a choral may be either a  perfect (_a_) or imperfect consonance (_b_). [Fig. 156.]    [Illustration: Fig. 156.]    Modulation often occurs at the holds. If so, make it clear.    In this and in succeeding lessons set the cantus firmus in any part, and  transpose if necessary.      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _b_ write two counterpoints above and two below.    To cantus firmus _a_ write one above and one below, with both parts resting  at the hold. Also do the same _with the counterpoint continuing at the  hold_. [Fig. 155_a, b._]      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 157.]          LESSON XXXIV    FREE HARMONIZATION IN THREE-PART COUNTERPOINT      When writing in three or more parts, it is well to let a part rest  occasionally, and, when it reenters, have it imitate one of the other  parts. [Fig. 158.]    [Illustration: Fig. 158.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below in  two-part counterpoint.    Write two original eight-measure phrases in two-part counterpoint.    To cantus firmus _b_ write one example in three-part counterpoint with  continuous movement at the hold. [Fig. 159.]    [Illustration: Fig. 159.]      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 160.]          LESSON XXXV      To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write two parts. Write each three times, setting  the cantus firmus in all parts in turn. Write one of the solutions of the  choral with continuous movement at the hold.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 161.]          LESSON XXXVI      Write two eight-measure phrases, and one sixteen-measure phrase, of  original counterpoint in three parts.          LESSON XXXVII    FREE HARMONIZATION IN FOUR-PART COUNTERPOINT      [Illustration: Fig. 162.]      EXERCISES    To the cantus firmus write three parts.    Write two sixteen-measure phrases of original four-part counterpoint, one  major and one minor.      CANTUS FIRMUS    [Illustration: Fig. 163.]          LESSON XXXVIII      In this and the following lessons have the parts in some of the exercises  begin one after the other in imitation. [Fig. 151.]      EXERCISES    Write two eight-measure phrases, and one sixteen-measure phrase, of  original four-part counterpoint.          LESSON XXXIX      Write two sixteen-measure phrases of original four-part counterpoint.          LESSON XL      Write an original exercise in four-part counterpoint, extended to  thirty-two measures."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#6)"],[1,"pt.\" At length \"she declares her passion, and pressed  him to answer her. It never entered her mind that the advances of a  woman of her rank could ever be rejected. Joseph at first only replied  to all her wishes by his cold embarrassments. She would not yet give him  up. In vain he flies from her; she was too passionate to waste even the  moments of his astonishment.\" This good father, however, does ample  justice to the gallantry of the Patriarch Jacob. He offers to serve  Laban, seven years for Rachel. \"Nothing is too much,\" cries the  venerable novelist, \"when one really loves;\" and this admirable  observation he confirms by the facility with which the obliging Rachel  allows Leah for one night to her husband! In this manner the patriarchs  are made to speak in the tone of the tenderest lovers; Judith is a  Parisian coquette, Holofernes is rude as a German baron; and their  dialogues are tedious with all the reciprocal politesse of metaphysical  French lovers! Moses in the desert, it was observed, is precisely as  pedantic as Pere Berruyer addressing his class at the university. One  cannot but smile at the following expressions:--\"By the easy manner in  which God performed miracles, one might easily perceive they cost no  effort.\" When he has narrated an \"Adventure of the Patriarchs,\" he  proceeds, \"After such an extraordinary, or curious, or interesting  adventure,\" &c. This good father had caught the language of the beau  monde, but with such perfect simplicity that, in employing it on sacred  history, he was not aware of the ludicrous style in which he was  writing.    A Gothic bishop translated the Scriptures into the Goth language, but  omitted the _Books of Kings_! lest the _wars_, of which so much is there  recorded, should increase their inclination to fighting, already too  prevalent. Jortin notices this castrated copy of the Bible in his  Remarks on Ecclesiastical History.    As the Bible, in many parts, consists merely of historical transactions,  and as too many exhibit a detail of offensive ones, it has often  occurred to the fathers of families, as well as to the popes, to  prohibit its general reading. Archbishop Tillotson formed a design of  purifying the historical parts. Those who have given us a _Family  Shakspeare_, in the same spirit may present us with a _Family Bible_.    In these attempts to recompose the Bible, the broad vulgar colloquial  diction, which has been used by our theological writers, is less  tolerable than the quaintness of Castalion and the floridity of Pere  Berruyer.    The style now noticed long disgraced the writings of our divines; and we  see it sometimes still employed by some of a certain stamp. Matthew  Henry, whose commentaries are well known, writes in this manner on  Judges ix.:--\"We are here told by what acts Abimelech _got into the  saddle_.--None would have _dreamed_ of making such a _fellow_ as he  king.--See how he has _wheedled_ them into the choice. He hired into his  service the _scum_ and _scoundrels_ of the country. Jotham was really a  _fine gentleman_.--The Sechemites that set Abimelech up, were the first  to _kick him off_. The Sechemites said all the ill they could of him in  their _table-talk_; they _drank healths_ to his _confusion_.--Well,  Gaal's interest in Sechem is soon at an end. _Exit Gaal_!\"    Lancelot Addison, by the vulgar coarseness of his style, forms an  admirable contrast with the amenity and grace of his son's Spectators.  He tells us, in his voyage to Barbary, that \"A rabbin once told him,  among other _heinous stuff_, that he did not expect the felicity of the  next world on the account of any merits but his own; whoever kept the  law would arrive at the bliss, by _coming upon his own legs_.\"    It must be confessed that the rabbin, considering he could not  conscientiously have the same creed as Addison, did not deliver any very  \"heinous stuff,\" in believing that other people's merits have nothing to  do with our own; and that \"we should stand on our own legs!\" But this  was not \"proper words in proper places.\"          ORIGIN OF THE MATERIALS OF WRITING.      It is curious to observe the various substitutes for paper before its  discovery.    Ere the invention of recording events by writing, trees were planted,  rude altars were erected, or heaps of stone, to serve as memorials of  past events. Hercules probably could not write when he fixed his famous  pillars.    The most ancient mode of writing was on _bricks_, _tiles_, and  _oyster-shells_, and on _tables of stone_; afterwards on _plates_ of  various materials, on _ivory_, on _barks_ of trees, on _leaves_ of  trees.[7]    Engraving memorable events on hard substances was giving, as it were,  speech to rocks and metals. In the book of Job mention is made of  writing on _stone_, on _rocks_, and on sheets of _lead_. On tables of  _stone_ Moses received the law written by the finger of God. Hesiod's  works were written on _leaden_ tables: lead was used for writing, and  rolled up like a cylinder, as Pliny states. Montfaucon notices a very  ancient book of eight leaden leaves, which on the back had rings  fastened by a small leaden rod to keep them together. They afterwards  engraved on bronze: the laws of the Cretans were on bronze tables; the  Romans etched their public records on brass. The speech of Claudius,  engraved on plates of bronze, is yet preserved in the town-hall of  Lyons, in France.[8] Several bronze tables, with Etruscan characters,  have been dug up in Tuscany. The treaties among the Romans, Spartans,  and the Jews, were written on brass; and estates, for better security,  were made over on this enduring metal. In many cabinets may be found the  discharge of soldiers, written on copper-plates. This custom has been  discovered in India: a bill of feoffment on copper, has been dug up near  Bengal, dated a century before the birth of Christ.    Among these early inventions many were singularly rude, and miserable  substitutes for a better material. In the shepherd state they wrote  their songs with thorns and awls on straps of leather, which they wound  round their crooks. The Icelanders appear to have scratched their  _runes_, a kind of hieroglyphics, on walls; and Olaf, according to one  of the Sagas, built a large house, on the bulks and spars of which he  had engraved the history of his own and more ancient times; while  another northern hero appears to have had nothing better than his own  chair and bed to perpetuate his own heroic acts on. At the town-hall, in  Hanover, are kept twelve wooden boards, overlaid with bees'-wax, on  which are written the names of owners of houses, but not the names of  streets. These _wooden manuscripts_ must have existed before 1423, when  Hanover was first divided into streets. Such manuscripts may be found in  public collections. These are an evidence of a rude state of _society_.  The same event occurred among the ancient Arabs, who, according to the  history of Mahomet, seemed to have carved on the shoulder-bones of sheep  remarkable events with a knife, and tying them with a string, hung up  these sheep-bone chronicles.    The laws of the twelve tables, which the Romans chiefly copied from the  Grecian code, were, after they had been approved by the people, engraven  on brass: they were melted by lightning, which struck the Capitol; a  loss highly regretted by Augustus. This manner of writing we still  retain, for inscriptions, epitaphs, and other memorials designed to  reach posterity.    These early inventions led to the discovery of tables of _wood_; and as  _cedar_ has an antiseptic quality from its bitterness, they chose this  wood for cases or chests to preserve their most important writings. This  well-known expression of the ancients, when they meant to give the  highest eulogium of an excellent work, _et cedro digna locuti_, that it  was worthy to be written on _cedar_, alludes to the _oil of cedar_, with  which valuable MSS. of parchment were anointed, to preserve them from  corruption and moths. Persius illustrates this:--        Who would not leave posterity such rhymes      As _cedar oil_ might keep to latest times!    They stained materials for writing upon, with purple, and rubbed them  with exudations from the cedar. The laws of the emperors were published  on _wooden tables_, painted with ceruse; to which custom Horace alludes:  _Leges incidere ligno_. Such _tables_, the term now softened into  _tablets_, are still used, but in general are made of other materials  than wood. The same reason for which they preferred the _cedar_ to other  wood induced to write on _wax_, as being incorruptible. Men generally  used it to write their testaments on, the better to preserve them; thus  Juvenal says, _Ceras implere capaces_. This thin paste of wax was also  used on tablets of wood, that it might more easily admit of erasure, for  daily use.    They wrote with an iron bodkin, as they did on the other substances we  have noticed. The _stylus_ was made sharp at one end to write with, and  blunt and broad at the other, to efface and correct easily: hence the  phrase _vertere stylum_, to turn the stylus, was used to express  blotting out. But the Romans forbad the use of this sharp instrument,  from the circumstance of many persons having used them as daggers. A  schoolmaster was killed by the Pugillares or table-books, and the styles  of his own scholars.[9] They substituted a _stylus_ made of the bone of  a bird, or other animal; so that their writings resembled engravings.  When they wrote on softer materials, they employed _reeds_ and _canes_  split like our _pens_ at the points, which the orientalists still use to  lay their colour or ink neater on the paper.    Naude observes, that when he was in Italy, about 1642, he saw some of  those waxen tablets, called Pugillares, so called because they were held  in one hand; and others composed of the barks of trees, which the  ancients employed in lieu of"]]]
