[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#6)"],[1," Vilna; this time I was moving with the  advance column.  At dinner that night with General von Weber, the  commander of the city, the subject of American arms and ammunition was  again brought up.  The General said they had captured from the Russians  an American machine gun.  He added that they were bringing it in from  Smorgon to show the Americans.  When it reached us the stamp, written  in English, showed that it was manufactured by Vickers Limited,  England.  Being unable to read English, the officer who reported the  capture thought the gun was made in the United States.    In Roumania last December I followed General von Falkenhayn's armies to  the forts of Bucharest.  On Thanksgiving Day I crossed by automobile  the Schurduck Pass.  The Roumanians had defended, or attempted to  defend, this road by mounting armoured guns on the crest of one of the  mountain ranges in the Transylvanian Alps.  I examined a whole position  here and found all turrets were made in Germany.    I did not doubt that the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies  had been a great aid to them.  (I was told in Paris, later, on my way  to the United States that if it had not been for the American  ammunition factories France would have been defeated long ago.)  But  when Germany argued that the United States was not neutral in  permitting these shipments to leave American ports, Germany was  forgetting what her own arms and munition factories had done _for  Germany's enemies_.  When the Krupp works sold Russia the defences for  Kovno, the German Government knew these weapons would be used against  Germany some day, because no nation except Germany could attack Russia  by way of that city.  When Krupps sold war supplies to Roumania, the  German Government knew that if Roumania joined the Allies these  supplies would be used against German soldiers.  But the Government was  careful not to report these facts in German newspapers.  And, although  Secretary of State von Jagow acknowledged to Ambassador Gerard that  there was nothing in international law to justify a change in  Washington's position, von Jagow's statements were not permitted to be  published in Germany.    To understand Germany's resentment over Mr. Wilson's interference with  the submarine warfare, three things must be taken into consideration.    1. The Allies' charge that all Germans are \"Huns and Barbarians.\"    2. The battle of the Marne and the shipment of arms and ammunition from  the United States.    3. The intrigue and widening breach between the Army and Navy and the  Foreign Office.      I    One weapon the Allies used against Germany, which was more effective  than all others, was the press.  When the English and French indicted  the Germans as \"Barbarians and Huns,\" as \"pirates,\" and \"uncivilised\"  Europeans, it cut the Germans to the quick; it affected men and women  so terribly that Germans feared these attacks more than they did the  combined military might of their enemies.  This is readily understood  when one realises that before the war the thing the Germans prided  themselves on was their commerce and their civilisation,--their Kultur.  Before the war, the world was told by every German what the nation had  done for the poor; what strides the scientists had made in research  work and what progress the business men had made in extending their  commerce at the expense of competitors.    While some government officials foresaw the disaster which would come  to Germany if this national vanity was paraded before the whole world,  their advice and counsel were ignored.  Consul General Kiliani, the  Chief German official in Australia before the war, told me he had  reported repeatedly to the Foreign Office that German business men were  injuring their own opportunities by bragging so much of what they had  done, and what they would do.  He said if it continued the whole world  would be leagued against Germany; that public opinion would be so  strong against German goods that they would lose their markets.  Germany made the whole world fear her commercial might by this foolish  bragging.    So when the war broke out and Germans were attacked for being  uncivilised in Belgium, for breaking treaties and for disregarding the  opinion of the world, it was but natural that German vanity should  resent it.  Germans feared nothing but God and public opinion.  They  had such exalted faith in their army they believed they could gain by  Might what they had lost in prestige throughout the world.  This is one  of the reasons the German people arose like one man when war was  declared.  They wished and were ready to show the world that they were  the greatest people ever created.      II    The German explanation of why they lost the battle of the Marne is  interesting, not alone because of the explanation of the defeat, but  because it shows why the shipment of arms and ammunition from the  United States was such a poisonous pill to the army.  Shortly after my  arrival in Berlin Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, then Under Secretary of State,  said the greatest scandal in Germany after the war would be the  investigation of the reasons for the shortage of ammunition in  September, 1914.  He did not deny that Germany was prepared for a great  war.  He must have known at the time what the Director of the Post and  Telegraph knew on the 2nd of August, 1914, when he wrote Announcement  No. 3.  The German Army must have known the same thing and if it had  prepared for war, as every German admits it had, then preparations were  made to fight nine nations.  But there was one thing which Germany  failed to take into consideration, Zimmermann said, and that was the  shipment of supplies from the United States.  Then, he added, there  were two reasons why the battle of the Marne was lost: one, because  there was not sufficient ammunition; and, two, because the reserves  were needed to stop the Russian invasion of East Prussia.  I asked him  whether Germany did not have enormous stores of ammunition on hand when  the war began.  He said there was sufficient ammunition for a short  campaign, but that the Ministry of War had not mobilised sufficient  ammunition factories to keep up the supplies.  He said this was the  reason for the downfall of General von Herringen, who was Minister of  War at the beginning of hostilities.    After General von Kluck was wounded and returned to his villa in  Wilmersdorf, a suburb of Berlin, I took a walk with him in his garden  and discussed the Marne.  He confirmed what Zimmermann stated about the  shortage of ammunition and added that he had to give up his reserves to  General von Hindenburg, who had been ordered by the Kaiser to drive the  Russians from East Prussia.      III    At the very beginning of the war, although no intimations were  permitted to reach the outside world, there was a bitter controversy  between the Foreign Office, as headed by the Chancellor von  Bethmann-Hollweg; the Navy Department, headed by Grand Admiral von  Tirpitz, and General von Moltke, Chief of the General Staff.  The  Chancellor delayed mobilisation of the German Army three days.  For  this he never has and never will be forgiven by the military  authorities.  During those stirring days of July and August, when  General von Moltke, von Tirpitz, von Falkenhayn, Krupps and the Rhine  Valley Industrial leaders were clamouring for war and for an invasion  of Belgium, the Kaiser was being urged by the Chancellor and the  Foreign Office to heed the proposals of Sir Edward Grey for a Peace  Conference.  But the Kaiser, who was more of a soldier than a  statesman, sided with his military friends.  The war was on, not only  between Germany and the Entente, but between the Foreign Office and the  Army and Navy.  This internal fight which began in July, 1914, became  Germany's bitterest struggle and from time to time the odds went from  one side to another.  The Army accused the diplomats of blundering in  starting the war.  The Foreign Office replied that it was the lust for  power and victory which poisoned the military leaders which caused the  war.  Belgium was invaded against the counsel of the Foreign Office.  But when the Chancellor was confronted with the actual invasion and the  violation of the treaty, he was compelled by force of circumstance, by  his position and responsibility to the Kaiser to make his famous speech  in the Reichstag in which he declared: \"Emergency knows no law.\"    But when the allied fleet swept German ships from the high seas and  isolated a nation which had considered its international commerce one  of its greatest assets, considerable animosity developed between the  Army and Navy.  The Army accused the Navy of stagnation.  Von Tirpitz,  who had based his whole naval policy upon a great navy, especially upon  battleship and cruiser units, was confronted by his military friends  with the charge that he was not prepared.  As early as 1908 von Tirpitz  had opposed the construction of submarines.  Speaking in the Reichstag  when naval appropriations were debated, he said Germany should rely  upon a battleship fleet and not upon submarines.  But when he saw his  great inactive Navy in German waters, he switched to the submarine idea  of a blockade of England.  In February, 1915, he announced his  submarine blockade of England with the consent of the Kaiser, but  without the approval of the Foreign Office.    By this time the cry, \"Gott strafe England,\" had become the most  popular battle shout in Germany.  The von Tirpitz blockade announcement  made this battlecry real.  It made him the national hero.  The German  press, which at that time was under three different censors, turned its  entire support over night to the von Tirpitz plan.  The Navy  Department, which even then was not only anti-British but  anti-American, wanted to sink every ship on the high seas.  When the  United States lodged its protests on February 12th the German Navy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"should prove to be part of an island only, or if I should not  be able to find the said Cape, I was in the first case to make the  necessary survey of the island, and then to stand on to the southward, so  long as I judged there was a likelihood of falling in with the continent,  which I was also to do in the latter case, and then to proceed to the  eastward in further search of the said continent, as well as to make  discoveries of such islands as might be situated in that unexplored part of  the southern hemisphere; keeping in high latitudes, and prosecuting my  discoveries, as above mentioned, as near the pole as possible until I had  circumnavigated the globe; after which I was to proceed to the Cape of Good  Hope, and from thence to Spithead.    In the prosecution of these discoveries, wherever the season of the year  rendered it unsafe for me to continue in high latitudes, I was to retire to  some known place to the northward, to refresh my people, and refit the  ships; and to return again to the southward as soon as the season of the  year would admit of it. In all unforeseen cases, I was authorised to  proceed according to my own discretion; and in case the Resolution should  be lost or disabled, I was to prosecute the voyage on board the Adventure.    I gave a copy of these instructions to Captain Furneaux, with an order  directing him to carry them into execution; and, in case he was separated  from me, appointed the island of Madeira for the first place of rendezvous;  Port Praya in the island of St Jago for the second; Cape of Good Hope for  the third; and New Zealand for the fourth.    During our stay at Plymouth, Messrs Wales and Bayley, the two astronomers,  made observations on Drake's Island, in order to ascertain the latitude,  longitude, and true time for putting the time-pieces and watches in motion.  The latitude was found to be 50 deg. 21' 30\" N., and the longitude 4 deg. 20' W. of  Greenwich, which, in this voyage, is every where to be understood as the  first meridian, and from which the longitude is reckoned east and west to  180 deg. each way.    1772 July    On the 10th of July the watches were set a-going in the  presence of the two astronomers, Captain Furneaux, the first lieutenants of  the ships, and myself, and put on board. The two on board the Adventure  were made by Mr Arnold, and also one of those on board the Resolution; but  the other was made by Mr Kendal, upon the same principle, in every respect,  as Mr Harrison's time-piece. The commander, first lieutenant, and  astronomer, on board each, of the ships, kept each of them keys of the  boxes which contained the watches, and were always to be present at the  winding them up, and comparing the one with the other; or some other  officer, if at any time, through indisposition, or absence upon any other  necessary duties, any of them could not conveniently attend. The same day,  according to the custom of the navy, the companies of both ships were paid  two months wages in advance, and, as a further encouragement for their  going this extraordinary voyage, they were also paid the wages due to them  to the 28th of the preceding May. This enabled them to provide necessaries  for the voyage.    On the 13th, at six o'clock in the morning, I sailed from Plymouth Sound,  with the Adventure in company; and on the evening of the 29th anchored in  Funchiale Road, in the island of Madeira. The next morning I saluted the  garrison with eleven guns; which compliment was immediately returned. Soon  after I went on shore, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, the two Mr  Forsters, and Mr Wales. At our landing, we were received by a gentleman  from the vice-consul, Mr Sills, who conducted us to the house of Mr  Loughnans, the most considerable English merchant in the place. This  gentleman not only obtained leave for Mr Forster to search the island for  plants, but procured us every other thing we wanted, and insisted on our  accommodating ourselves at his house during our stay.    The town of Funchiale, which is the capital of the island, is situated  about the middle of the south side, in the bottom of the bay of the same  name, in latitude 32 deg. 33' 34\" N., longitude 17 deg. 12-7/8\" W. The longitude  was deduced from lunar observations made by Mr Wales, and reduced to the  town by Mr Kendal's watch, which made the longitude 17 deg. 10' 14\" W. During  our stay here, the crews of both ships were supplied with fresh beef and  onions; and a quantity of the latter was distributed amongst them for a  sea-store.    1772 August    Having got on board a supply of water, wine, and other necessaries, we left  Madeira on the 1st of August, and stood to the southward with a fine gale  at N.E. On the 4th we passed Palma, one of the Canary isles. It is of a  height to be seen twelve or fourteen leagues, and lies in the latitude 28 deg.  38' N., longitude 17 deg. 58' W. The next day we saw the isle of Ferro, and  passed it at the distance of fourteen leagues. I judged it to lie in the  latitude of 27 deg. 42' N. and longitude 18 deg. 9' W.    I now made three puncheons of beer of the inspissated juice of malt. The  proportion I made use of was about ten of water to one of juice. Fifteen of  the nineteen half barrels of the inspissated juice which we had on board,  were produced from wort that was hopped before inspissated. The other four  were made of beer that had been both hopped and fermented before  inspissated. This last requires no other preparation to make it fit for  use, than to mix it with cold water, from one part in eight to one part in  twelve of water, (or in such other proportion as might be liked,) then stop  it down, and in a few days it will be brisk and drinkable. But the other  sort, after being mixed with water in the same manner, will require to be  fermented with yeast, in the usual way of making beer; at least it was so  thought. However, experience taught us that this will not always be  necessary: For by the heat of the weather, and the agitation of the ship,  both sorts were at this time in the highest state of fermentation, and had  hitherto evaded all our endeavours to stop it. If this juice could be kept  from fermenting, it certainly would be a most valuable article at sea.    On finding that our stock of water would not last as to the Cape of Good  Hope, without putting the people to a scanty allowance, I resolved to stop  at St Jago for a supply. On the 9th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we  made the island of Bonavista, bearing S.W. The next day, we passed the isle  of Mayo on our right; and the same evening anchored in Port Praya in the  island of St Jago, in eighteen fathom water. The east point of the bay bore  E.; the west point S.W. 1/2 S.; and the fort N.W. I immediately dispatched  an officer to ask leave to water, and purchase refreshments, which was  granted. On the return of the officer, I saluted the fort with eleven guns,  on a promise of its being returned with an equal number. But by a mistake,  as they pretended, the salute was returned with only nine; for which the  governor made an excuse the next day. The 14th, in the evening, having  completed our water, and got on board a supply of refreshments, such as  hogs, goats, fowls, and fruit, we put to sea, and proceeded on our voyage.    Port Praya is a small bay, situated about the middle of the south side of  the island of St Jago, in the latitude of 14 deg. 53' 30\" N. longitude 23 deg. 30'  W. It may be known, especially in coming from the east, by the southernmost  hill on the island, which is round, and peaked at top; and lies a little  way inland, in the direction of west from the port. This mark is the more  necessary, as there is a small cove about a league to the eastward, with a  sandy beach in the bottom of it, a valley, and cocoa-nut trees behind,  which strangers may mistake for Port Praya, as we ourselves did. The two  points which form the entrance of Port Praya Bay are rather low, and in the  direction of W.S.W. and E.N.E. half a league from each other. Close to the  west point are sunken rocks, on which the sea continually breaks. The bay  lies in N.W. near half a league; and the depth of water is from fourteen to  four fathoms. Large ships ought not to anchor in less than eight, in which  depth the south end of the Green Island (a small island lying under the  west shore) will bear W. You water at a well that is behind the beach at  the head of the bay. The water is tolerable, but scarce; and bad getting  off, on account of a great surf on the beach. The refreshments to be got  here, are bullocks, hogs, goats, sheep, poultry, and fruits. The goats are  of the antelope kind, so extraordinarily lean, that hardly any thing can  equal them; and the bullocks, hogs, and sheep, are not much better.  Bullocks must be purchased with money; the price is twelve Spanish dollars  a-head, weighing between 250 and 300 pounds. Other articles may be got from  the natives in exchange for old clothes, &c. But the sale of bullocks is  confined to a company of merchants; to whom this privilege is granted, and  who keep an agent residing upon the spot. The fort above mentioned seems  wholly designed for the protection of the bay, and is well situated for  that purpose, being built on an elevation, which rises directly from the  sea on the right, at the head of the bay.    We had no sooner got clear of Port Praya, than we got a fresh gale at  N.N.E. which blew in squalls, attended with showers of rain. But the next  day the wind and showers abated, and veered to the S. It was, however,  variable and unsettled for several days, accompanied with dark gloomy  weather, and showers of rain.    On the 19th, in the afternoon, one of the carpenter's mates fell overboard,  and was drowned. He was over the side, fitting in one of the scuttles, from  whence it is supposed he had fallen; for he was not seen till the very  instant he sunk under the ship's stern,"]]]
