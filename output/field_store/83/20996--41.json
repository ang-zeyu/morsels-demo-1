I  found the people of that city submerged and drowning in a sea of  materialism. Their conversations and discussions were limited to natural  and physical phenomena, without mention of God. I was greatly astonished.  Most of the scholars, professors and learned men proved to be  materialists. I said to them, \"I am surprised and astonished that men of  such perceptive caliber and evident knowledge should still be captives of  nature, not recognizing the self-evident Reality.\"    The phenomenal world is entirely subject to the rule and control of  natural law. These myriad suns, satellites and heavenly bodies throughout  endless space are all captives of nature. They cannot transgress in a  single point or particular the fixed laws which govern the physical  universe. The sun in its immensity, the ocean in its vastness are  incapable of violating these universal laws. All phenomenal beings--the  plants in their kingdom, even the animals with their intelligence--are  nature's subjects and captives. All live within the bounds of natural law,  and nature is the ruler of all except man. Man is not the captive of  nature, for although according to natural law he is a being of the earth,  yet he guides ships over the ocean, flies through the air in airplanes,  descends in submarines; therefore, he has overcome natural law and made it  subservient to his wishes. For instance, he imprisons in an incandescent  lamp the illimitable natural energy called electricity--a material force  which can cleave mountains--and bids it give him light. He takes the human  voice and confines it in the phonograph for his benefit and amusement.  According to his natural power man should be able to communicate a limited  distance, but by overcoming the restrictions of nature he can annihilate  space and send telephone messages thousands of miles. All the sciences,  arts and discoveries were mysteries of nature, and according to natural  law these mysteries should remain latent, hidden; but man has proceeded to  break this law, free himself from this rule and bring them forth into the  realm of the visible. Therefore, he is the ruler and commander of nature.  Man has intelligence; nature has not. Man has volition; nature has none.  Man has memory; nature is without it. Man has the reasoning faculty;  nature is deprived. Man has the perceptive faculty; nature cannot  perceive. It is therefore proved and evident that man is nobler than  nature.    If we accept the supposition that man is but a part of nature, we are  confronted by an illogical statement, for this is equivalent to claiming  that a part may be endowed with qualities which are absent in the whole.  For man who is a part of nature has perception, intelligence, memory,  conscious reflection and susceptibility, while nature itself is quite  bereft of them. How is it possible for the part to be possessed of  qualities or faculties which are absent in the whole? The truth is that  God has given to man certain powers which are supernatural. How then can  man be considered a captive of nature? Is he not dominating and  controlling nature to his own uses more and more? Is he not the very  divinity of nature? Shall we say nature is blind, nature is not  perceptive, nature is without volition and not alive, and then relegate  man to nature and its limitations? How can we answer this question? How  will the materialists and scholastic atheists prove and support such a  supposition? As a matter of fact, they themselves make natural laws  subservient to their own wish and purpose. The proof is complete that in  man there is a power beyond the limitations of nature, and that power is  the bestowal of God.    In New York I find the people more endowed with spiritual  susceptibilities. They are not mere captives of nature's control; they are  rising out of the bonds and burden of captivity. For this reason I am very  happy and hopeful that, God willing, in this populous country, in this  vast continent of the West, the virtues of the world of humanity shall  become resplendent; that the oneness of human world-power, the love of  God, may enkindle the hearts, and that international peace may hoist its  standards, influencing all other regions and countries from here. This is  my hope.          16 April 1912  Talk at Hotel Ansonia to Baha'i Friends of New Jersey  Broadway and Seventy-third Street, New York      Notes by Ahmad Sohrab    Souls from the East and West have been brought together here through the  power of the Holy Spirit. Such a gathering as this would be impossible  through material means. A meeting of this kind has never been established  in New York, for here tonight we find people from remote regions of the  earth, associated with the people of America in the utmost love and  spiritual unity. This is only possible through the power of God. Christ  appeared in this world nineteen hundred years ago to establish ties of  unity and bonds of love between the various nations and different  communities. He cemented together the sciences of Rome and the splendors  of the civilization of Greece. He also accomplished affiliation between  the Assyrian kingdom and the power of Egypt. The blending of these nations  in unity, love and agreement had been impossible, but Christ through  divine power established this condition among the children of men.    A much greater difficulty confronts us today when we endeavor to establish  unity between the Orient and the Occident. Baha'u'llah through the power  of heaven has brought the East and the West together. Erelong we shall  know that they have been cemented by the power of God. The oneness of the  kingdom of humanity will supplant the banner of conquest, and all  communities of the earth will gather under its protection. No nation with  separate and restricted boundaries--such as Persia, for instance--will  exist. The United States of America will be known only as a name. Germany,  France, England, Turkey, Arabia--all these various nations will be welded  together in unity. When the people of the future are asked, \"To which  nationality do you belong?\" the answer will be, \"To the nationality of  humanity. I am living under the shadow of Baha'u'llah. I am the servant of  Baha'u'llah. I belong to the army of the Most Great Peace.\" The people of  the future will not say, \"I belong to the nation of England, France or  Persia\"; for all of them will be citizens of a universal nationality--the  one family, the one country, the one world of humanity--and then these  wars, hatreds and strifes will pass away.    Baha'u'llah appeared in a country which was the center of prejudice. In  that country were many different communities, religions, sects and  denominations. All the animosities of past centuries existed among them.  They were ready to kill each other. They considered the killing of others  who did not agree with them in religious belief an act of worship.  Baha'u'llah established such unity and agreement between these various  communities that the greatest love and amity are now witnessed among them.    Today the Baha'is of the East are longing with deep desire to see you face  to face. Their highest hope and fondest wish is that the day may come when  they will be gathered together in an assembly with you. Consider well the  power that accomplished this wonderful transformation.    The body of the human world is sick. Its remedy and healing will be the  oneness of the kingdom of humanity. Its life is the Most Great Peace. Its  illumination and quickening is love. Its happiness is the attainment of  spiritual perfections. It is my wish and hope that in the bounties and  favors of the Blessed Perfection we may find a new life, acquire a new  power and attain to a wonderful and supreme source of energy so that the  Most Great Peace of divine intention shall be established upon the  foundations of the unity of the world of men with God. May the love of God  be spread from this city, from this meeting to all the surrounding  countries. Nay, may America become the distributing center of spiritual  enlightenment, and all the world receive this heavenly blessing! For  America has developed powers and capacities greater and more wonderful  than other nations. While it is true that its people have attained a  marvelous material civilization, I hope that spiritual forces may animate  this great body and a corresponding spiritual civilization be established.  May the inhabitants of this country become like angels of heaven with  faces turned continually toward God. May all of them become the servants  of the Omnipotent One. May they rise from present material attainments to  such a height that heavenly illumination may stream from this center to  all the peoples of the world.    The divine Jerusalem has come down from heaven. The bride of Zion has  appeared. The voice of the Kingdom of God has been raised. May you attain  supreme capacity and magnetic attraction in this realm of might and  power--manifesting new energy and wonderful accomplishment, for God is your  Assister and Helper. The breath of the Holy Spirit is your comforter, and  the angels of heaven surround you. I desire this power for you. Rest  assured that these bounties now overshadow you.          17 April 1912  Talk at Hotel Ansonia  Broadway and Seventy-third Street, New York      Notes by Howard MacNutt    During my visit to London and Paris last year I had many talks with the  materialistic philosophers of Europe. The basis of all their conclusions  is that the acquisition of knowledge of phenomena is according to a fixed,  invariable law--a law mathematically exact in its operation through the  senses. For instance, the eye sees a chair; therefore, there is no doubt  of the chair's existence. The eye looks up into the heavens and beholds  the sun; I see flowers upon this table; I smell their fragrance; I hear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#6)"],[1,"love and to demonstrate to all that the grace of God is one. Thus will the  tabernacles of holiness be upraised on the summits of the earth, gathering  all peoples into the protective shadow of the Word of Oneness. This great  bounty will dawn over the world at the time when the lovers of God shall  arise to carry out His Teachings, and to scatter far and wide the fresh,  sweet scents of universal love.    In every dispensation, there hath been the commandment of fellowship and  love, but it was a commandment limited to the community of those in mutual  agreement, not to the dissident foe. In this wondrous age, however,  praised be God, the commandments of God are not delimited, not restricted  to any one group of people, rather have all the friends been commanded to  show forth fellowship and love, consideration and generosity and  loving-kindness to every community on earth. Now must the lovers of God  arise to carry out these instructions of His: let them be kindly fathers  to the children of the human race, and compassionate brothers to the  youth, and self-denying offspring to those bent with years. The meaning of  this is that ye must show forth tenderness and love to every human being,  even to your enemies, and welcome them all with unalloyed friendship, good  cheer, and loving-kindness. When ye meet with cruelty and persecution at  another's hands, keep faith with him; when malevolence is directed your  way, respond with a friendly heart. To the spears and arrows rained upon  you, expose your breasts for a target mirror-bright; and in return for  curses, taunts and wounding words, show forth abounding love. Thus will  all peoples witness the power of the Most Great Name, and every nation  acknowledge the might of the Ancient Beauty, and see how He hath toppled  down the walls of discord, and how surely He hath guided all the peoples  of the earth to oneness; how He hath lit man's world, and made this earth  of dust to send forth streams of light.    These human creatures are even as children, they are brash and  unconcerned. These children must be reared with infinite, loving care, and  tenderly fostered in the embraces of mercy, so that they may taste the  spiritual honey-sweetness of God's love; that they may become like unto  candles shedding their beams across this darksome world, and may clearly  perceive what blazing crowns of glory the Most Great Name, the Ancient  Beauty, hath set on the brows of His beloved, what bounties He hath  bestowed on the hearts of those He holdeth dear, what a love He hath cast  into the breasts of humankind, and what treasures of friendship He hath  made to appear amongst all men.    O God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants to have loving and tender  hearts. Help them to spread, amongst all the nations of the earth, the  light of guidance that cometh from the Company on high. Verily Thou art  the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Ever-Giving.  Verily Thou art the Generous, the Gentle, the Tender, the Most Bountiful.            8: O YE BELOVED OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA AND YE HANDMAIDS OF ...      O ye beloved of 'Abdu'l-Baha and ye handmaids of the Merciful! It is early  morning, and the reviving winds of the Abha Paradise are blowing over all  creation, but they can stir only the pure of heart, and only the pure  sense can detect their fragrance. Only the perceiving eye beholdeth the  rays of the sun; only the listening ear can hear the singing of the  Concourse on high. Although the plentiful rains of spring, the bestowals  of Heaven, pour down upon all things, they can only fructify good soil;  they love not brackish ground, where no results of all the bounty can be  shown.    Today the soft and holy breathings of the Abha Realm are passing over  every land, but only the pure in heart draw nigh and derive a benefit  therefrom. It is the hope of this wronged soul that from the grace of the  Self-Subsistent One and by the manifest power of the Word of God, the  heads of the unmindful may be cleared, that they may perceive these sweet  savours which blow from secret rosebeds of the spirit.    O ye friends of God! True friends are even as skilled physicians, and the  Teachings of God are as healing balm, a medicine for the conscience of  man. They clear the head, so that a man can breathe them in and delight in  their sweet fragrance. They waken those who sleep. They bring awareness to  the unheeding, and a portion to the outcast, and to the hopeless, hope.    If in this day a soul shall act according to the precepts and the counsels  of God, he will serve as a divine physician to mankind, and like the trump  of Israfil,(16) he will call the dead of this contingent world to life;  for the confirmations of the Abha Realm are never interrupted, and such a  virtuous soul hath, to befriend him, the unfailing help of the Company on  high. Thus shall a sorry gnat become an eagle in the fulness of his  strength, and a feeble sparrow change to a royal falcon in the heights of  ancient glory.    Wherefore, look not on the degree of your capacity, ask not if you are  worthy of the task: rest ye your hopes on the help and loving-kindness,  the favours and bestowals of Baha'u'llah--may my soul be offered up for His  friends! Urge on the steed of high endeavour over the field of sacrifice,  and carry away from this wide arena the prize of divine grace.    O ye handmaids of the merciful Lord! How many queens of this world laid  down their heads on a pillow of dust and disappeared. No fruit was left of  them, no trace, no sign, not even their names. For them, no more granting  of bestowals; for them, no more living at all. Not so the handmaids who  ministered at the Threshold of God; these have shone forth like glittering  stars in the skies of ancient glory, shedding their splendours across all  the reaches of time. These have fulfilled their dearest hopes in the Abha  Paradise; they have tasted the honey of reunion in the congregation of the  Lord. Such souls as these profited from their existence here on earth:  they plucked the fruit of life. As for the rest, 'There surely came upon  them a time when they were a thing not spoken of.'    O ye lovers of this wronged one! Cleanse ye your eyes, so that ye behold  no man as different from yourselves. See ye no strangers; rather see all  men as friends, for love and unity come hard when ye fix your gaze on  otherness. And in this new and wondrous age, the Holy Writings say that we  must be at one with every people; that we must see neither harshness nor  injustice, neither malevolence, nor hostility, nor hate, but rather turn  our eyes toward the heaven of ancient glory. For each of the creatures is  a sign of God, and it was by the grace of the Lord and His power that each  did step into the world; therefore they are not strangers, but in the  family; not aliens, but friends, and to be treated as such.    Wherefore must the loved ones of God associate in affectionate fellowship  with stranger and friend alike, showing forth to all the utmost  loving-kindness, disregarding the degree of their capacity, never asking  whether they deserve to be loved. In every instance let the friends be  considerate and infinitely kind. Let them never be defeated by the malice  of the people, by their aggression and their hate, no matter how intense.  If others hurl their darts against you, offer them milk and honey in  return; if they poison your lives, sweeten their souls; if they injure  you, teach them how to be comforted; if they inflict a wound upon you, be  a balm to their sores; if they sting you, hold to their lips a refreshing  cup.    O God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants; they are Thy loyal bondsmen  and Thy handmaidens, who have bowed themselves down before Thine exalted  Utterance and humbled themselves at Thy Threshold of light, and borne  witness to Thy oneness through which the Sun hath been made to shine in  midday splendour. They have listened to the summons Thou didst raise from  out Thy hidden Realm, and with hearts quivering with love and rapture,  they have responded to Thy call.    O Lord, shower upon them all the outpourings of Thy mercy, rain down upon  them all the waters of Thy grace. Make them to grow as beauteous plants in  the garden of heaven, and from the full and brimming clouds of Thy  bestowals and out of the deep pools of Thine abounding grace make Thou  this garden to flower and keep it ever green and lustrous, ever fresh and  shimmering and fair.    Thou art verily the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, He Who alone, in  the heavens and on the earth, abideth unchanged. There is none other God  save Thee, the Lord of manifest tokens and signs.            9: O THOU WHOSE HEART OVERFLOWETH WITH LOVE FOR THE ...      O thou whose heart overfloweth with love for the Lord! I address thee from  this consecrated spot, to gladden thy bosom with mine epistle to thee, for  this is such a letter as maketh the heart of him who believeth in God's  oneness to wing its flight toward the summits of bliss.    Thank thou God for having enabled thee to enter into His Kingdom of might.  Erelong will thy Lord's bounties descend upon thee, one following the  other, and He will make of thee a sign for every seeker after truth.    Hold thou fast to the Covenant of thy Lord, and as the days go by,  increase thy store of love for His beloved ones. Bend thou with tenderness  over the servitors of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest hoist the sail of  love upon the ark of peace that moveth across the seas of life. Let  nothing grieve thee, and be thou angered at none. It behoveth thee to be  content with the Will of God, and a true and loving and trusted friend to  all the peoples of the earth, without any exceptions whatever. This is the  quality of the sincere, the way of the saints, the emblem of those who  believe in the unity of God, and the raiment of the people of Baha.    Thank thou and bless thou the Lord "]]]
