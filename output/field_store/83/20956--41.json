There came a leap of her  heart every time she thought of the meeting with Glenn, so soon now  to be, but it was not that which was unfamiliar. She seemed to have a  difficult approach to undefined and unusual thoughts. All this was  so different from her regular life. Besides she was tired. But these  explanations did not suffice. There was a pang in her breast which must  owe its origin to the fact that Glenn Kilbourne had been ill in this  little room and some other girl than Carley Burch had nursed him. \"Am I  jealous?\" she whispered. \"No!\" But she knew in her heart that she lied.  A woman could no more help being jealous, under such circumstances, than  she could help the beat and throb of her blood. Nevertheless, Carley was  glad Flo Hutter had been there, and always she would be grateful to her  for that kindness.    Carley disrobed and, donning her dressing gown, she unpacked her bags  and hung her things upon pegs under the curtained shelves. Then she  lay down to rest, with no intention of slumber. But there was a strange  magic in the fragrance of the room, like the piny tang outdoors, and in  the feel of the bed, and especially in the low, dreamy hum and murmur of  the waterfall. She fell asleep. When she awakened it was five o'clock.  The fire in the stove was out, but the water was still warm. She bathed  and dressed, not without care, yet as swiftly as was her habit at home;  and she wore white because Glenn had always liked her best in white. But  it was assuredly not a gown to wear in a country house where draughts of  cold air filled the unheated rooms and halls. So she threw round her  a warm sweater-shawl, with colorful bars becoming to her dark eyes and  hair.    All the time that she dressed and thought, her very being seemed to be  permeated by that soft murmuring sound of falling water. No moment of  waking life there at Lolomi Lodge, or perhaps of slumber hours, could  be wholly free of that sound. It vaguely tormented Carley, yet was not  uncomfortable. She went out upon the porch. The small alcove space  held a bed and a rustic chair. Above her the peeled poles of the roof  descended to within a few feet of her head. She had to lean over the  rail of the porch to look up. The green and red rock wall sheered  ponderously near. The waterfall showed first at the notch of a fissure,  where the cliff split; and down over smooth places the water gleamed,  to narrow in a crack with little drops, and suddenly to leap into a thin  white sheet.    Out from the porch the view was restricted to glimpses between the  pines, and beyond to the opposite wall of the canyon. How shut-in, how  walled in this home!    \"In summer it might be good to spend a couple of weeks here,\"  soliloquized Carley. \"But to live here? Heavens! A person might as well  be buried.\"    Heavy footsteps upon the porch below accompanied by a man's voice  quickened Carley's pulse. Did they belong to Glenn? After a strained  second she decided not. Nevertheless, the acceleration of her blood and  an unwonted glow of excitement, long a stranger to her, persisted as she  left the porch and entered the boarded hall. How gray and barn-like this  upper part of the house! From the head of the stairway, however, the big  living room presented a cheerful contrast. There were warm colors, some  comfortable rockers, a lamp that shed a bright light, and an open fire  which alone would have dispelled the raw gloom of the day.    A large man in corduroys and top boots advanced to meet Carley. He had a  clean-shaven face that might have been hard and stern but for his smile,  and one look into his eyes revealed their resemblance to Flo's.    \"I'm Tom Hutter, an' I'm shore glad to welcome you to Lolomi, Miss  Carley,\" he said. His voice was deep and slow. There were ease and force  in his presence, and the grip he gave Carley's hand was that of a  man who made no distinction in hand-shaking. Carley, quick in her  perceptions, instantly liked him and sensed in him a strong personality.  She greeted him in turn and expressed her thanks for his goodness to  Glenn. Naturally Carley expected him to say something about her fiance,  but he did not.    \"Well, Miss Carley, if you don't mind, I'll say you're prettier than  your picture,\" said Hutter. \"An' that is shore sayin' a lot. All the  sheep herders in the country have taken a peep at your picture. Without  permission, you understand.\"    \"I'm greatly flattered,\" laughed Carley.    \"We're glad you've come,\" replied Hutter, simply. \"I just got back  from the East myself. Chicago an' Kansas City. I came to Arizona from  Illinois over thirty years ago. An' this was my first trip since. Reckon  I've not got back my breath yet. Times have changed, Miss Carley. Times  an' people!\"    Mrs. Hutter bustled in from the kitchen, where manifestly she had been  importantly engaged. \"For the land's sakes!\" she exclaimed, fervently,  as she threw up her hands at sight of Carley. Her expression was indeed  a compliment, but there was a suggestion of shock in it. Then Flo came  in. She wore a simple gray gown that reached the top of her high shoes.    \"Carley, don't mind mother,\" said Flo. \"She means your dress is lovely.  Which is my say, too.... But, listen. I just saw Glenn comin' up the  road.\"    Carley ran to the open door with more haste than dignity. She saw a tall  man striding along. Something about him appeared familiar. It was his  walk--an erect swift carriage, with a swing of the march still visible.  She recognized Glenn. And all within her seemed to become unstable. She  watched him cross the road, face the house. How changed! No--this was  not Glenn Kilbourne. This was a bronzed man, wide of shoulder, roughly  garbed, heavy limbed, quite different from the Glenn she remembered. He  mounted the porch steps. And Carley, still unseen herself, saw his face.  Yes--Glenn! Hot blood seemed to be tingling liberated in her veins.  Wheeling away, she backed against the wall behind the door and held up  a warning finger to Flo, who stood nearest. Strange and disturbing then,  to see something in Flo Hutter's eyes that could be read by a woman in  only one way!    A tall form darkened the doorway. It strode in and halted.    \"Flo!--who--where?\" he began, breathlessly.    His voice, so well remembered, yet deeper, huskier, fell upon Carley's  ears as something unconsciously longed for. His frame had so filled  out that she did not recognize it. His face, too, had unbelievably  changed--not in the regularity of feature that had been its chief charm,  but in contour of cheek and vanishing of pallid hue and tragic line.  Carley's heart swelled with joy. Beyond all else she had hoped to see  the sad fixed hopelessness, the havoc, gone from his face. Therefore  the restraint and nonchalance upon which Carley prided herself sustained  eclipse.    \"Glenn! Look--who's--here!\" she called, in voice she could not  have steadied to save her life. This meeting was more than she had  anticipated.    Glenn whirled with an inarticulate cry. He saw Carley. Then--no matter  how unreasonable or exacting had been Carley's longings, they were  satisfied.    \"You!\" he cried, and leaped at her with radiant face.    Carley not only did not care about the spectators of this meeting, but  forgot them utterly. More than the joy of seeing Glenn, more than  the all-satisfying assurance to her woman's heart that she was still  beloved, welled up a deep, strange, profound something that shook her  to her depths. It was beyond selfishness. It was gratitude to God and to  the West that had restored him.    \"Carley! I couldn't believe it was you,\" he declared, releasing her from  his close embrace, yet still holding her.    \"Yes, Glenn--it's I--all you've left of me,\" she replied, tremulously,  and she sought with unsteady hands to put up her dishevelled hair.  \"You--you big sheep herder! You Goliath!\"    \"I never was so knocked off my pins,\" he said. \"A lady to see me--from  New York!... Of course it had to be you. But I couldn't believe. Carley,  you were good to come.\"    Somehow the soft, warm look of his dark eyes hurt her. New and strange  indeed it was to her, as were other things about him. Why had she not  come West sooner? She disengaged herself from his hold and moved away,  striving for the composure habitual with her. Flo Hutter was standing  before the fire, looking down. Mrs. Hutter beamed upon Carley.    \"Now let's have supper,\" she said.    \"Reckon Miss Carley can't eat now, after that hug Glenn gave her,\"  drawled Tom Hutter. \"I was some worried. You see Glenn has gained  seventy pounds in six months. An' he doesn't know his strength.\"    \"Seventy pounds!\" exclaimed Carley, gayly. \"I thought it was more.\"    \"Carley, you must excuse my violence,\" said Glenn. \"I've been hugging  sheep. That is, when I shear a sheep I have to hold him.\"    They all laughed, and so the moment of readjustment passed. Presently  Carley found herself sitting at table, directly across from Flo. A  pearly whiteness was slowly warming out of the girl's face. Her frank  clear eyes met Carley's and they had nothing to hide. Carley's first  requisite for character in a woman was that she be a thoroughbred. She  lacked it often enough herself to admire it greatly in another woman.  And that moment saw a birth of respect and sincere liking in her for  this Western girl. If Flo Hutter ever was a rival she would be an honest  one.    Not long after supper Tom Hutter winked at Carley and said he \"reckoned  on general principles it was his hunch to go to bed.\" Mrs. Hutter  suddenly discovered tasks to perform elsewhere. And Flo said in her cool  sweet drawl, somehow audacious and tantalizing, \"Shore you two will want  to spoon.\"    \"Now, Flo, Eastern girls are no longer old-fashioned enough for that,\"  declared Glenn.    \"Too bad! Reckon I can't see how love could ever be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#6)"],[1,"gressions.    Ye cannot alter the things which the Almighty hath prescribed unto Me.  Naught shall touch Me besides that which God, My Lord, hath pre-ordained  for Me. In Him have I placed My whole trust and upon Him do the faithful  place their complete reliance.    Bear Thou witness unto Me, O Lord. By sending forth this resplendent  Epistle I shall have proclaimed Thy Verses unto both of them and shall  have fulfilled Thy Testimony for them. I am well pleased to lay down My  life in Thy path and ere long to return to Thy presence. Unto Thee be  praise in the heavens and on the earth. Deal with them according to Thy  decree. In truth Thou art the best protector and helper.    Set right, O Lord, such disorders as people stir up, and cause Thy Word to  shine resplendent throughout the earth, so that no trace of the ungodly  may remain.    I beg forgiveness of Thee, O My Lord, for that which I have uttered in Thy  Epistle, and I repent unto Thee. I am but one of Thy servants who give  praise to Thee. Glorified art Thou; no God is there but Thee. In Thee have  I placed My whole trust and of Thee do I beg pardon for being a suppliant  at Thy door.    Sanctified is God thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, from that which  the people wrongfully and without the guidance of His lucid Book, affirm  of Him. Peace be upon them that beseech forgiveness from God thy Lord,  saying: 'Verily, praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.'          Extracts From A Tablet Containing Words Addressed To The Sherif Of Mecca      O Sherif!... All thy life thou hast accorded worship unto Us, but when We  manifested Ourself unto thee, thou didst desist from bearing witness unto  Our Remembrance, and from affirming that He is indeed the Most Exalted,  the Sovereign Truth, the All-Glorious. Thus hath Thy Lord put thee to  proof in the Day of Resurrection. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.    For hadst thou uttered 'Here am I' at the time We sent thee the Book, We  would have admitted thee to the company of such of Our servants as truly  believe, and would have graciously praised thee in Our Book, until the Day  when all men shall appear before Us for judgement. This is in truth far  more advantageous unto thee than all the acts of worship thou hast  performed for thy Lord during all thy life, nay, from the beginning that  hath no beginning. Assuredly this is what would have served and will ever  serve thy best interests. Verily We are cognizant of all things. Yet  notwithstanding that We had called thee into being for the purpose of  attaining Our presence in the Day of Resurrection, thou didst shut thyself  out from Us without any reason or explicit Writ; whereas hadst thou been  among such as are endowed with the knowledge of the Bayan, thou wouldst  have, at the sight of the Book, testified forthwith that there is no God  but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and wouldst have affirmed  that He Who hath revealed the Qur'an, hath likewise revealed this Book,  that every word of it is from God, and unto it we all bear allegiance.    However, that which was preordained hath come to pass. Shouldst thou  return unto Us while revelation still continueth through Us, We shall  transform thy fire into light. Truly We are powerful over all things. But  if thou failest in this task, thou shalt find no way open to thee other  than to embrace the Cause of God and to implore that the matter of thine  allegiance be brought to the attention of Him Whom God shall make  manifest, that He may graciously enable thee to prosper and cause thy fire  to be transformed into light. This is that which hath been sent down unto  Us. Should this not come to pass, whatever We have set down shall remain  binding and irrevocably decreed by God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting, and We shall therefore banish thee from Our presence as a  token of justice on Our part. Verily we are equitable in Our judgement.          Address To A Muslim Divine      O 'Abdu's-Sahib! Verily God and every created thing testify that there is  none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Best Beloved...    Thy vision is obscured by the belief that divine revelation ended with the  coming of Muhammad, and unto this We have borne witness in Our first  epistle. Indeed, He Who hath revealed verses unto Muhammad, the Apostle of  God, hath likewise revealed verses unto 'Ali-Muhammad. For who else but  God can reveal to a man such clear and manifest verses as overpower all  the learned? Since thou hast acknowledged the revelation of Muhammad, the  Apostle of God, then there is no other way open before thee but to testify  that whatever is revealed by the Primal Point hath also proceeded from  God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Is it not true that the  Qur'an hath been sent down from God and that all men are powerless before  its revelation? Likewise these words have also been revealed by God, if  thou dost but perceive. What is there in the Bayan which keepeth thee back  from recognizing these verses as being sent forth by God, the  Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious?    The essence of these words is this: Were We to bring thee to a reckoning,  thou wouldst prove thyself empty-handed; We in truth know all things.  Hadst thou uttered 'yea' on hearing the Words of God, thou wouldst have  been seen to have been worshipping God from the beginning that hath no  beginning until the present day, never to have disobeyed Him, not even for  the twinkling of an eye. Yet, neither the upright deeds thou hast wrought  during all thy life, nor the exertions thou didst make to banish every  thought from thy heart save that of the good-pleasure of God, none of  these did in truth profit thee, not even to the extent of a grain of  mustard seed, inasmuch as thou didst veil thyself from God and tarried  behind at the time of His manifestation.    Verily all the divines in the land of Kaf [Kufih] shall, even as thyself,  be asked by God: 'Is it not strange that a Messenger should have come to  you with a Book, and ye, while confessing your powerlessness, refused to  follow the Faith of God which He had brought, and ye persisted in your  disbelief?' Therefore unto thee shall be assigned the fire which was meant  for those who turned away from God in that land, inasmuch as thou art  their leader; would that thou might be of them who heed.    Hadst thou faithfully obeyed the Decree of God, all the inhabitants of thy  land would have followed thee, and would have themselves entered into the  celestial Paradise, content with the good-pleasure of God for evermore.  However, on that day thou shalt wish that God had not created thee.    Thou hast set thyself up as one of the learned in the Faith of Islam, that  thou mightest save the believers, yet thou didst cause thy followers to  descend into the fire, for when the verses of God were sent forth thou  didst deprive thyself therefrom and yet reckoned thyself to be of the  righteous... Nay, by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! Neither  thou nor any one among His servants can produce the slightest proof, while  God shineth resplendent above His creatures and through the power of His  behest standeth supreme over all that dwell in the kingdoms of heaven and  earth and in whatever lieth between them. Verily He is potent over all  created things.    Thou hath named thyself 'Abdu's Sahib [servant of the Lord]. Yet, while  God hath, in very truth, made thy Lord manifest, and thou didst set thine  eyes upon Him, thou didst not recognize Him, even though thou hadst been  called into being by God for the purpose of attaining His presence, didst  thou but truly believe in the third verse of the chapter entitled  'Thunder'.(8)    Thou contendest, 'How can we recognize Him when we have heard naught but  words which fall short of irrefutable proofs?' Yet since thou hast  acknowledged and recognized Muhammad, the Apostle of God, through the  Qur'an, how canst thou withhold recognition from Him Who sent thee the  Book, despite thy calling thyself 'His servant'? Verily He doth exercise  undisputed authority over His revelations unto all mankind.    Wert thou to come unto Us while divine revelation is descending upon Us,  haply God will change thy fire into light. Verily He is the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Otherwise that which hath been revealed  is decisive and final and will be faithfully upheld by all until the Day  of Resurrection... If divine revelation ceaseth, thou shouldst write a  petition to Him Whom God shall make manifest, imploring that it be  delivered into His presence. Therein thou must beg pardon of thy Lord,  turn unto Him in repentance and be of them that are wholly devoted to Him.  Perchance God will transform thy fire into light at the next Resurrection.  He, of a truth, is the Protector, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving.  Unto Him bow down in worship all that are in the heavens and on the earth  and whatever lieth between them; and unto Him shall all return.    We enjoin thee to save thyself and all the inhabitants of that land from  the fire, then to enter the peerless and exalted Paradise of His  good-pleasure. Otherwise the day is approaching when thou shalt perish and  enter the fire, when thou shalt have neither patron nor helper from God.  We have taken compassion on thee, as a sign of Our grace, inasmuch as thou  hast related thyself unto Us. Verily We are aware of all things. We are  cognizant of thy righteous deeds, though they shall avail thee nothing;  for the whole object of such righteousness is but recognition of God, thy  Lord, and undoubted faith in the Words revealed by Him.          Address To Sulayman, One Of The Muslim Divines In The Land Of Masqat      This is an Epistle from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto  Sulayman in the land of Masqat, to the right of the Sea. In truth there is  none other God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting..."]]]
