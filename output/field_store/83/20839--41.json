For beginners, perhaps one or two of Huenten's Etudes  Melodiques; a little later, one of Czerny's very judicious Etudes from  his opus 740; and for more advanced pupils, after they are able to  stretch easily and correctly, his Toccata, opus 92,--a piece which my  three daughters never give up playing, even if they do not play it every  day. They practise pieces of this description as a remedy for mechanical  deficiencies, changing them every three or four months. In the selection  of these, I aim especially at the practice of thirds, trills,  stretches, scales, and passages for strengthening the fourth finger; and  I choose them with reference to the particular pieces, sonatas,  variations, concertos, &c., which they are at the time studying.  Likewise, in the choice of the latter, I pursue a different course from  that which the teachers alluded to above and others are accustomed to  follow; though I hope my management is never pedantic, but cautious,  artistic, and psychologic. It is easy to see that many teachers, by  giving lessons continually, particularly to pupils without talent, are  led, even with the best intentions, to fall into a mere routine. We find  them often impatient and unsympathetic, especially in the teaching of  their own compositions; and again, by their one-sided opinions and  capricious requirements, by devoting attention to matters of small  importance, and by all sorts of whimsicalities, they contract the  intellectual horizon of their pupils, and destroy their interest in the  lessons.    MRS. SOLID. Your careful mode of proceeding is certainly extremely  interesting and convincing; but allow me to request an answer to various  objections and considerations which are now and then brought forward,  particularly by teachers.    DOMINIE. To that I am quite accustomed. The good and the beautiful  never obtain uncontested recognition. No one has ever offered any new  improvement, and fearlessly spoken the truth, without being attacked,  defamed, and despised, or entirely misunderstood. Our age can show many  proofs of this; for example, let us remember homoeopathy and magnetism.  Clara Wieck was not appreciated in Leipzig until she had been admired in  Paris; nor Marie Wieck, because she does not play exactly as her sister  Clara does. The same is the case with my present book, which  relentlessly treads upon the incredible follies and lamentable errors of  the times. I am quite prepared for opposition of any kind.    MRS. SOLID. I should like to suggest to you that there are other  teachers who have given themselves a great deal of trouble, and who are  very particular; but it is not their good fortune to have daughters like  yours to educate.    DOMINIE. Have given themselves a great deal of trouble? What do you mean  by that? If they do not take pains in the right way, or at the right  time and place, it is all labor in vain. Of what use is mere unskilful,  stupid industry? For instance, when a teacher, in order to correct a  stiff use of the fingers and wrist, and the general faulty touch of his  pupil, gives some wonderful etude or a piece with great stretches and  arpeggios for the left hand, and gives himself unwearied trouble over  it, it is a proof of abundant painstaking; but it is labor thrown away,  and only makes the imperfect mode of performance the worse.    And now with regard to my daughters. It has been their fortune to have  had me for a father and teacher: they certainly have talent, and I have  been successful in rousing and guiding it. Envy, jealousy, pride, and  offended egotism have tried as long as possible to dispute this; but at  last the effort is abandoned. They say that it requires no art to  educate such talent as theirs, that it almost \"comes of itself.\" This  assertion is just as false and contrary to experience as it is common,  even with educated and thoughtful people, who belong to no clique.  Lichtenburg says: \"It is just those things upon which everybody is  agreed that should be subjected to investigation.\" Well, I have made a  thorough investigation of these accusations, with regard to my three  daughters, and all the talented pupils whom I have been able to educate  for good amateurs, and, according to circumstances, for good public  performers. The great number of these suffices for my justification. I  must add, still further, that it is exactly the \"great talents\" for  singing, or for the piano, who require the most careful, thoughtful, and  prudent guidance. Look around at the multitude of abortive talents and  geniuses! Talented pupils are just the ones who have an irresistible  desire to be left to their own discretion; they esteem destruction by  themselves more highly than salvation by others.    MRS. SOLID. But it is said that you have been able to educate only your  three daughters, and none others for public performers.    DOMINIE. Madam, you cannot be serious. If I were to declaim Leporello's  list, you might justly consider it an exaggeration; but if, instead of  replying to you, I should urge you to read what I have written on the  subject, or if I should present your daughter Emily to you, after three  or four years, as a superior performer, you might pardon my vanity and  my ability. I do not possess any magic wand, which envy and folly could  not impute to me as an offence. Nevertheless, unless circumstances were  very adverse, I have, at all events, been able in a short time to  accomplish for my pupils the acquisition of a good, or at least an  improved, musical touch; and have thus laid a foundation, which other  teachers have failed to do by their method, or rather want of method.  But you have something else on your mind?    MRS. SOLID. You anticipate me. I was educated in Berlin, and in that  capital of intelligence a taste prevails for opposition, negation, and  thorough criticism. How can you educate artists and _virtuosos_, when  you yourself are so little a _virtuoso_? You are not even a composer or  learned contrapuntist. A teacher of music wins much greater  consideration, if he himself plays concertos and composes pretty things,  and if he can calculate and give vent to his genius in double and triple  fugues, and in inverse and retrograde canons. You cannot even accompany  your pupils with the violin or flute, which is certainly very useful and  improving.    DOMINIE. The egotist is seldom capable of giving efficient instruction:  that lies in the nature of the case. Even a child will soon perceive  whether the teacher has a sole eye to its interest, or has other and  personal aims in view. The former bears good fruits, the latter very  doubtful ones. I will say nothing about the stand-point of those  egotistical teachers whose first aim is to bring themselves into  prominence, and who at the same time are perhaps travelling public  performers and composers. They are, it may be, chiefly occupied with  double and triple fugues (the more inverted the more learned), and they  consider this knowledge the only correct musical foundation. At the same  time, they often possess a touch like that of your brother, Mr. Strict,  mentioned in my third chapter, and are utterly devoid of true taste and  feeling. While pursuing their fruitless piano lessons, which are quite  foreign to their customary train of thought, they regard their  occupation only as a milch cow; and they obtain the money of sanguine  parents, and sacrifice the time of their pupils. You may try such  agreeable personages for yourself: I could wish you no greater  punishment.    And now I will speak of the violin and the flute. I have never availed  myself of those expedients; it is a method which I have never learned. I  will describe for your amusement a few interesting incidents, which I  had an opportunity to witness in a not inconsiderable city, while on a  journey with my daughters. The teacher with the flute was a gentle,  quiet, mild musician; he was on very good terms with his pupil, and  indulged in no disputes; every thing went on peaceably, without passion,  and \"in time.\" They both twittered tenderly and amicably, and were  playing, in celebration of the birthday of an old aunt who was rather  hard of hearing, a sonata by Kuhlau, which was quite within the power of  both. The old aunt, who, of course, could hear but little of the soft,  flute tones, and the light, thin, modest, square piano, kept asking me:  \"Is not that exquisite? what do you think of it?\" I nodded my head and  praised it, for the music was modest and made no pretension.    I will pass next to the violin. The possessor of this was a type of  presumption, vulgarity, and coarseness, and understood how to make an  impression on his pupils and their parents by the assumption of  extraordinary ability. He consequently enjoyed a certain consideration.  He was, moreover, a good musician, and played the violin tolerably in  accompanying the piano, in Beethoven's opus 17 and 24. In this portrait  you have a specimen of the violinist as a piano teacher. Of course he  understood nothing of piano-playing, and took no interest in Wieck's  rubbish about beauty of tone; he cared only for Beethoven. He now and  then tried to sprawl out a few examples of fingering, in a spider-like  fashion; but they were seldom successful. His pupils also possessed the  peculiar advantage of playing \"in time,\" when they did not stick fast  in the difficult places. At such times he always became very cross and  severe, and talked about \"precision;\" in that way instilling respect.  His pupils did not jingle, but they had a peculiarly short, pounding  touch; and floundered about among the keys with a sort of boldness, and  with resolute, jerking elbows. They certainly had no tone, but the  violin was therefore heard the better; and after each performance we  might have heard, \"Am I not the first teacher in Europe?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#6)"],[1,"on the  ground and kissed his Mother Earth, having thus guessed the right  meaning of the answer.    He waited patiently, however, and still was thought a fool when the army  went out to besiege the city of Ardea; and while the troops were  encamped round it, some of the young patricians began to dispute which  had the best wife. They agreed to put it to the test by galloping late  in the evening to look in at their homes and see what their wives were  about. Some were idling, some were visiting, some were scolding, some  were dressing, some were asleep; but at Collatia, the farm of another of  the Tarquin family, thence called Collatinus, they found his beautiful  wife Lucretia among her maidens spinning the wool of the flocks. All  agreed that she was the best of wives; but the wicked Sextus Tarquin  only wanted to steal her from her husband, and going by night to  Collatia, tried to make her desert her lord, and when she would not  listen to him he ill-treated her cruelly, and told her that he should  accuse her to her husband. She was so overwhelmed with grief and shame  that in the morning she sent for her father and husband, told them all  that that happened, and saying that she could not bear life after being  so put to shame, she drew out a dagger and stabbed herself before their  eyes--thinking, as all these heathen Romans did, that it was better to  die by one's own hand than to live in disgrace.    Lucius Brutus had gone to Collatia with his cousin, and while Collatinus  and his father-in-law stood horror-struck, he called to them to revenge  this crime. Snatching the dagger from Lucretia's breast, he galloped to  Rome, called the people together in the Forum, and, holding up the  bloody weapon in his hand, he made them a speech, asking whether they  would any longer endure such a family of tyrants. They all rose as one  man, and choosing Brutus himself and Collatinus to be their leaders, as  the consuls whom Servius Tullus had thought of making, they shut the  gates of Rome, and would not open them when Tarquin and his sons would  have returned. So ended the kingdom of Rome.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VI.    THE WAR WITH PORSENA.      From the time of the flight of the Tarquins, Rome was governed by two  consuls, who wore all the tokens of royalty except the crown. Tarquin  fled into Etruria, whence his grandfather had come, and thence tried to  obtain admission into Rome. The two young sons of Brutus and the nephews  of Collatinus were drawn into a plot for bringing them back again, and  on its discovery were brought before the two consuls. Their guilt was  proved, and their father sternly asked what they had to say in their  defence. They only wept, and so did Collatinus and many of the senators,  crying out, \"Banish them, banish them.\" Brutus, however, as if unmoved,  bade the executioners do their office. The whole Senate shrieked to hear  a father thus condemn his own children, but he was resolute, and  actually looked on while the young men were first scourged and then  beheaded.    Collatinus put off the further judgment in hopes to save his nephews,  and Brutus told them that he had put them to death by his own power as a  father, but that he left the rest to the voice of the people, and they  were sent into banishment. Even Collatinus was thought to have acted  weakly, and was sent into exile--so determined were the Romans to have  no one among them who would not uphold their decrees to the utmost.  Tarquin advanced to the walls and cut down all the growing corn around  the Campus Martius and threw it into the Tiber; there it formed a heap  round which an island was afterwards formed. Brutus himself and his  cousin Aruns Tarquin soon after killed one another in single combat in a  battle outside the walls, and all the women of Rome mourned for him as  for a father.    Tarquin found a friend in the Etruscan king called Lars Porsena, who  brought an army to besiege Rome and restore him to the throne. He  advanced towards the gate called Janiculum upon the Tiber, and drove the  Romans out of the fort on the other side the river. The Romans then  retreated across the bridge, placing three men to guard it until all  should be gone over and it could be broken down.    [Illustration: BRUTUS CONDEMNING HIS SONS.]    There stood the brave three--Horatius, Lartius, and Herminius--guarding  the bridge while their fellow-citizens were fleeing across it, three men  against a whole army. At last the weapons of Lartius and Herminius were  broken down, and Horatius bade them hasten over the bridge while it  could still bear their weight. He himself fought on till he was wounded  in the thigh, and the last timbers of the bridge were falling into the  stream. Then spreading out his arms, he called upon Father Tiber to  receive him, leapt into the river and swam across amid a shower of  arrows, one of which put out his eye, and he was lame for life. A statue  of him \"halting on his thigh\" was set up in the temple of Vulcan, and he  was rewarded with as much land as one yoke of oxen could plough in a  day, and the 300,000 citizens of Rome each gave him a day's provision of  corn.    Porsena then blockaded the city, and when the Romans were nearly  starving he sent them word that he would give them food if they would  receive their old masters; but they made answer that hunger was better  than slavery, and still held out. In the midst of their distress, a  young man named Caius Mucius came and begged leave of the consuls to  cross the Tiber and go to attempt something to deliver his country. They  gave leave, and creeping through the Etruscan camp he came into the  king's tent just as Porsena was watching his troops pass by in full  order. One of his counsellors was sitting beside him so richly dressed  that Mucius did not know which was king, and leaping towards them, he  stabbed the counsellor to the heart. He was seized at once and dragged  before the king, who fiercely asked who he was, and what he meant by  such a crime.    The young man answered that his name was Caius Mucius, and that he was  ready to do and dare anything for Rome. In answer to threats of torture,  he quietly stretched out his right hand and thrust it into the flame  that burnt in a brazier close by, holding it there without a sign of  pain, while he bade Porsena see what a Roman thought of suffering.    Porsena was so struck that he at once gave the daring man his life, his  freedom, and even his dagger; and Mucius then told him that three  hundred youths like himself had sworn to have his life unless he left  Rome to her liberty. This was false, but both the lie and the murder  were for Rome's sake; they were both admired by the Romans, who held  that the welfare of their city was their very first duty. Mucius could  never use his right hand again, and was always called Scaevola, or the  Left-handed, a name that went on to his family.    Porsena believed the story, and began to make peace. A truce was agreed  on, and ten Roman youths and as many girls were given up to the  Etruscans as hostages. While the conferences were going on, one of the  Roman girls named Clelia forgot her duty so much as to swim home across  the river with all her companions; but Valeria, the consul's daughter,  was received with all the anger that breach of trust deserved, and her  father mounted his horse at once to take the party back again. Just as  they reached the Etruscan camp, the Tarquin father and brothers, and a  whole troop of the enemy, fell on them. While the consul was fighting  against a terrible force, Valeria dashed on into the camp and called out  Porsena and his son. They, much grieved that the truce should have been  broken, drove back their own men, and were so angry with the Tarquins as  to give up their cause. He asked which of the girls had contrived the  escape, and when Clelia confessed it was herself, he made her a present  of a fine horse and its trappings, which she little deserved.    This Valerius was called Publicola, or the people's friend. He died a  year or two later, after so many victories that the Romans honored him  among their greatest heroes. Tarquin still continued to seek support  among the different Italian nations, and again attacked the Romans with  the help of the Latins. The chief battle was fought close to Lake  Regillus; Aulus Posthumius was the commander, but Marcus Valerius,  brother to Publicola, was general of the horse. He had vowed to build a  temple to Castor and Pollux if the Romans gained the victory; and in the  beginning of the fight, two glorious youths of god-like stature appeared  on horseback at the head of the Roman horse and fought for them. It was  a very hard-fought battle. Valerius was killed, but so was Titus  Tarquin, and the Latin force was entirely broken and routed. That same  evening the two youths rode into the Forum, their horses dripping with  sweat and their weapons bloody. They drew up and washed themselves at a  fountain near the temple of Vesta, and as the people crowded round they  told of the great victory, and while one man named Domitius doubted of  it, since the Lake Regillus was too far off for tidings to have come so  fast, one of them laid his hand on the doubter's beard and changed it  in a moment from black to copper color, so that he came to be called  Domitius Ahenobarbus, or Brazen-beard. Then they disappeared, and the  next morning Posthumius' messenger brought the news. The Romans had no  doubt that these were indeed the glorious twins, and built their temple,  as Valerius had vowed.    [Illustration: ROMAN ENSIGNS, STANDARDS, TRUMPETS ETC.]    Tarquin had lost all his sons, and died in wretched exile at Cumae. And  here ends what is looked on as the legendary history of Rome, for though  most of these stories have dates, and some sound possible, there is so  much that is plainly untrue mixed up with them, that they can only be  looked on as the old"]]]
