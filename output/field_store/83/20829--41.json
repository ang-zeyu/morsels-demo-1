Indeed he said he didn't want to be an actor; his  ideal was to appear in white gloves. Each day brought new bickerings.  They made cuts despite my wishes; they left me at the mercy of the  insubordination and rudeness of the stage manager and the ballet master,  who would not listen to my most modest suggestions. I had to pay the  cost of extra musicians in the wings myself. Some stage settings which I  wanted for the prologue were declared impossible--I have seen them since  in the _Tales of Hoffman_.    Furthermore, the orchestra was very ordinary. There had to be numerous  rehearsals which they did not refuse me, but they took advantage of them  to spread the report that my music was unplayable. A young journalist  who is still alive (I will not name him) wrote two advance notices which  were intended to pave the way for the failure of my work.    At the last moment the director saw that he had been on the wrong tack  and that he might have a success. As they had played fairyland in the  theatre in the Square des-Arts-et-Metiers, he had at hand all the needed  material to give me a luxurious stage-setting without great expense.  Mlle. Caroline Salla was given the part of Helene. With her beauty and  magnificent voice she was certainly remarkable. But the passages which  had been written for the light high soprano of Madame Carvalho were  poorly adapted for a dramatic soprano. They concluded, therefore, that I  didn't know how to write vocal music.    In spite of everything the work was markedly successful, the natural  result of a splendid performance in which two stars--Melchissedech and  Mlle. Adeline Theodore, at present teacher of dancing at the  Opera--shone.    Poor Vizentini! His opinion of me has changed greatly since that time.  We were made to understand and love each other, so he has become, with  years, one of my best and most devoted friends. He first produced my  ballet _Javotte_ at the Grand-Theatre in Lyons, which the Monnaie in  Brussels had ordered and then refused. He had dreams of directing the  Opera-Comique and installing _Le Timbre d'Argent_ there. Fate willed  otherwise.    We have seen how the young French school was encouraged under the  Empire. The situation has improved and the old state of affairs has  never returned. But we find more than the analogy between the old point  of view and the one that was revealed not long ago when the French  musicians complained that they were more or less sacrificed in favor of  their foreign contemporaries. At bottom it is the same spirit in a  modified form.    To resume. As everyone knows, the way to become a blacksmith is by  working at a forge. Sitting in the shade does not give the experience  which develops talent. We should never have known the great days of the  Italian theatre, if Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi had had to  undergo our regime. If Mozart had had to wait until he was forty to  produce his first opera, we should never have had _Don Giovanni_ or _Le  Nozze di Figaro_, for Mozart died at thirty-five.    The policy imposed on Bizet and Delibes certainly deprived us of several  works which would now be among the glories of the repertoire at the  Opera and the Opera-Comique. That is an irreparable misfortune; one  which we cannot sufficiently deplore.          CHAPTER V    LOUIS GALLET      As _Dejanire_, cast in a new form, has again appeared in the vast frame  of the Opera stage, I may be allowed to recall my recollections of my  friend and collaborator, Louis Gallet, the diligent and chosen companion  of my best years, whose support was so dear and precious to me.  Collaboration for some reason unknown to me is deprecated. Opera, it is  said, should spring from the brain like Minerva, fully armed. So much  the better if such divine intellects can be found, but they are rare and  always will be. For dramatic and literary art on the one hand and  musical art on the other require different powers, which are not  ordinarily found in the same person.    I first met Louis Gallet in 1871. Camille du Locle, who was the manager  of the Opera-Comique at the time, could not put on _Le Timbre d'Argent_,  and while he waited for better days, which never came, to do that, he  offered me a one-act work. He proposed Louis Gallet as my collaborator,  although I had not known him until then. \"You were made to understand  each other,\" he told me. Gallet was then employed in some capacity at  the Beaujon hospital and lived near me in the Faubourg Saint-Honore. We  soon formed the habit of seeing each other every day. Du Locle had  judged aright. We had the same tastes in art and literature. We were  equally averse to whatever is too theatrical and also to whatever is not  sufficiently so, to the commonplace and the too extravagant. We both  despised easy success and we understood each other wonderfully. Gallet  was not a musician, but he enjoyed and understood music, and he  criticised with rare good taste.    Japan had recently been opened to Europeans. Japan was fashionable; all  they talked about was Japan, it was a real craze. So the idea of writing  a Japanese piece occurred to us. We submitted the idea to du Locle, but  he was afraid of an entirely Japanese stage setting. He wanted us to  soften the Japanese part, and it was he, I think, who had the idea of  making it half Japanese and half Dutch, the way the slight work _La  Princesse Jaune_ was cast.    That was only a beginning and in our daily talks we sketched the most  audacious projects. The leading concerts of the time did not balk at  performing large vocal works, as they too often do to-day to the great  detriment of the variety of their programmes. We then thought that we  were at the beginning of the prosperity of French oratorio which only  needed encouragement to flourish. I read by chance in an old Bible this  wonderful phrase,    \"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,\" and so I  proposed to Gallet that we do a Deluge. At first he wanted to introduce  characters. \"No,\" I said, \"put the Bible narrative into simple verse,  and I will do the rest.\" We know with what care and success he  accomplished his delicate task. Meanwhile he gave Massenet the texts for  _Marie-Madeleine_ and _Le Roi de Lahore_, and these two works created a  great stir in the operatic world.    We had dreams of historical opera, for we were quite without the  prejudice against this form of drama which afflicts the present school.  But I was not _persona grata_ to the managers and I did not know at what  door to knock, when one of my friends, Aime Gros, took the management of  the Grand-Theatre at Lyons and asked me for a work. This was a fine  opportunity and we grasped it. We put together, with difficulty but with  infinite zest, our historical opera, _Etienne Marcel_, in which Louis  Gallet endeavored to respect as far as is possible in a theatrical work  the facts of history. Despite illustrious examples to the contrary he  did not believe that it was legitimate to attribute to a character who  has actually lived acts and opinions that are entirely fanciful. I was  in full agreement with him in that as in so many other things. I go even  farther and cannot accustom myself to the queer sauces in which  legendary characters are often served. It seems to me that the legend is  the interesting thing, and not the character, and that the latter loses  all its value when the legend which surrounds it is destroyed. But  everyone knows that I am a crank.    Some time after my _Henri VIII_, in which Vaucorbeil had imposed  another collaborator on me, Ritt asked me for a new work. We were  looking about for a subject, when Gallet came to my house and timidly,  as if fearing a rebuff, proposed _Benvenuto Cellini_. I had thought of  that for a long time, and the idea had come to me of putting into  musical form that fine drama, which had had its hours of glory, where  Melingue modeled the statue of Hebe before the populace. I, therefore,  accepted the suggestion with pleasure. This enterprise brought me in  touch with Paul Meurice, whom I had known in my childhood, when he was  wooing Mlle. Granger, his first wife and an intimate friend of my  mother's. Paul Meurice revealed a secret to me: that the romance  _Ascanio_, attributed to Alexander Dumas, had been entirely written by  Meurice. The work met with a great success, and out of gratitude, Dumas  offered to help Meurice in constructing a drama from the romance, which  was to be signed by Meurice alone. So it is easy for one who knows  Dumas's dramas to find traces of his handiwork in _Benvenuto Cellini_.    It was not particularly easy to make an opera out of the play, and  Gallet and I worked together at it with considerable difficulty. We soon  saw that we should have to eliminate the famous scene of the casting of  the statue. When we reached this point in the play, Benvenuto had  already done a good deal of singing, and this scene with its violence  seemed certain to exceed the strength of the most valiant artist. In  connection with our _Proserpine_, I have been accused of supposing that  Vacquerie had genius. It would be too much to say that he had genius,  but he certainly had great talent. His prose showed a classical  refinement, and his poetry, in spite of fantastic passages which no one  could admire, was sonorous in tone, contained precious material, and was  both interesting and highly individual. What allured me in _Proserpine_  was the amount of inner emotion there was in the drama, which is very  advantageous to the music. Music gives expression to feelings which the  characters cannot express, and accentuates and develops the  picturesqueness of the piece; it makes acceptable what would not even  exist without it.    Vacquerie approved highly the convent scene which Gallet invented. This  introduced a quiet and peaceful note amidst the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#6)"],[1,"the lion wished to remain on the plantation that he should not question  the farmer's ownership nor assume that the lion was an animal of a higher  and finer grade than the farmer.    A meeting between the representatives of the lions and the farmers led to  no better understanding; in fact when, several days afterward, all the  farmers gathered at the historic Paardekraal monument, they were  unanimously of the opinion that the lion should be driven out of the  country, or at least subdued to such an extent that peace might come and  remain. Not since the days of 1877, when, at the same spot, each Boer,  holding a stone above his head, vowed to shed his last drop of blood in  defence of his country, was the community of farmers so indignant and  excited. The aged President himself, fresh from the conference with the  lions, urged his countrymen to prevent a conflict but to fight valiantly  for their independence and rights if the necessity arose. Piet Joubert,  who bore marks of a former conflict with the enemy, wept as he narrated  the efforts which had been made to pacify the lions, and finally expressed  the belief that every farmer in the country would yield his life's blood  rather than surrender the rights for which their fathers had bled and  died. When other leaders had spoken, the picturesque custom of renewing  the oath of fealty to the country's flag was observed, as it had been  every fifth year since the days of Majuba Hill. Ten thousand farmers  uncovered their heads, raised their eyes toward the sky and repeated the  Boer oath:--        \"In the presence of God Almighty, who searcheth the hearts of          men, from our homes in the Transvaal we have journeyed to          meet again, Free burghers, we ask His mercy and trust in          His grace and bind ourselves and our children in a solemn          oath to be faithful to one another and to stand by one          another in repelling our enemy with our last drop of          life-blood. So truly help us, God Almighty.\"    Ten thousand voices then joined in singing the national anthem and a  psalm, and the memorable meeting at this fount of patriotism was closed  with a prayer and a benediction.    After this meeting it was uncertain for some months which should attack  first; both were preparing as rapidly as possible for the conflict, and  the advantage seemed to lie with the one who would strike first. The  leaders of the lions seemed to have forgotten that they had lion-hunters  as their opponents, and the farmers neglected to take into account the  fact that the lion tribe was exceedingly numerous and spread over the  whole earth. When the leading farmers met in conclave at Pretoria and  heard the demands of the lions they laughed at them, sent an ultimatum in  reply, and started for the frontier to join those of their countrymen who  had gone there days before to watch that no body of lions should make  another surreptitious attack upon their country. Another community of  farmers living to the south, who had also been harassed by the lions for  many years and felt that their future safety lay in the subjugation of the  lion tribe, joined their neighbours in arms and went forth with them to  the greatest lion-hunt that South Africa has ever had.    The enemy and all other men called it war, but to the Boers it was merely  a hunt for lions such as they had engaged in oftentimes before.    The old Boer farmer hardly needed the proclamation from Pretoria to tell  him that there was to be a lion-hunt, and that he should prepare for it  immediately. He had known that the hunt was inevitable long before October  11, 1899, and he had made preparations for it months and even years  before. When the official notification from the Commandant-General reached  him through the field-cornet of the district in which he lived, he was  prepared in a few minutes to start for the frontier where the British  lions were to be found. The new Mauser rifle, which the Government had  given him a year or two before, was freshly oiled and its working order  inspected. The bandolier, filled with bright new cartridges, was swung  over his shoulder, and then, after putting a Testament into his coat  pocket, he was ready to proceed. He despised a uniform of any kind as  smacking of anti-republican ideas and likely to attract the attention of  the enemy. The same corduroy or mole-skin trousers, dark coat,  wide-brimmed hat, and home-made shoes which he was accustomed to wear in  every-day life on the farm were good enough for a hunting expedition, and  he needed and yearned for nothing better. A uniform would have caused him  to feel uneasy and out of place, and when lions were the game he wanted to  be thoroughly comfortable so that his arm and aim might be steady. His  vrouw, who was filling a linen sack with bread, biltong, and coffee to be  consumed on his journey to the hunting grounds, may have taken the  opportunity while he was cleaning his rifle to sew a rosette of the  vierkleur of the Republic on his hat, or, remembering the custom observed  in the old-time wars against the natives, may have found the fluffy brown  tail of a meerkatz and fixed it on the upturned brim of his grimy hat.  When these few preparations were concluded the Kafir servant brought his  master's horse and fixed to the front of the saddle a small roll  containing a blanket and a mackintosh. To another part of the saddle he  strapped a small black kettle to be used for the preparation of the  lion-hunter's only luxury, coffee, and then the list of impedimenta was  complete. The horseman who brought the summons to go to the frontier had  hardly reached the neighbouring farmhouse when the Boer lion-hunter,  uniformed, outfitted, and armed, was on his horse's back and ready for any  duty at any place. With a rifle, bandolier, and a horse the Boer felt as  if he were among kindred spirits, and nothing more was necessary to  complete his temporal happiness. The horse is a part of the Boer hunter,  and he might as well have gone to the frontier without a rifle as to go in  the capacity of a foot soldier. The Boer is the modern Centaur, and  therein is found an explanation for part of his success in hunting.    When once the Boer left his home he became an army unto himself. He needed  no one to care for himself and his horse, nor were the leaders of the army  obliged to issue myriads of orders for his guidance. He had learned long  before that he should meet the other hunters of his ward at a certain spot  in case there was a call to arms, and thither he went as rapidly as his  pony could carry him. When he arrived at the meeting-place he found all  his neighbours and friends gathered in groups and discussing the  situation. Certain ones of them had brought with them big white-tented  ox-waggons for conveying ammunition, commissariat stores, and such extra  luggage as some might wish to carry; and these were sent ahead as soon as  the field-cornet, the military leader of the ward, learned that all his  men had arrived from their homes. The individual hunters then formed what  was called a commando, whether it consisted of fifteen or fifty men, and  proceeded in a body to a second pre-arranged meeting-place, where all the  ward-commandos of a certain district were asked to congregate. When all  these commandos had arrived in one locality, they fell under the authority  of the commandant who had been elected to that post by the burghers at the  preceding election. This official had received his orders directly from  the Commandant-General, and but little time was consumed in disseminating  them to the burghers through the various field-cornets. After all the  ward-commandos had arrived, the district-commando was set in motion toward  that part of the frontier where its services were required; and a most  unwarlike spectacle it presented as it rolled along over the muddy,  slippery veld. In the van were the huge, lumbering waggons with hordes of  hullabalooing natives cracking their long raw-hide whips and urging the  sleek, long-horned oxen forward through the mud. Following the  waggon-train came the cavalcade of armed lion-hunters, grim and  determined-looking enough from a distance, but most peaceful and  inoffensive when once they understood the stranger's motives. No order or  discipline was visible in the commando on the march, and if the rifles and  bandoliers had not appeared so prominently it might readily have been  mistaken for a party of Nachtmaal celebrants on the way to Pretoria. Now  and then some youths emerged from the crowd and indulged in an impromptu  horse-race, only to return and receive a chiding from their elders for  wasting their horses' strength unnecessarily. Occasionally the keen eyes  of a rider spied a buck in the distance, and then several of the  lion-hunters sped obliquely off the track and replenished the commando  larder with much smaller game than was the object of their expedition.    If the commando came from a district far from the frontier, it proceeded  to the railway station nearest to the central meeting-place, and then  embarked for the front. No extraordinary preparations were necessary for  the embarking of a large commando, nor was much time lost before the  hunters were speeding towards their destination. Every man placed his own  horse in a cattle-car, his saddle, bridle, and haversack in the  passenger-coach, and then assisted in hoisting the cumbersome ox-waggons  on flat-top trucks. There were no specially deputised men to entrain the  horses, others to load the waggons, and still others to be subtracted from  the fighting strength of the nation by attending to such detail duties as  require the services of hundreds of men in other armies.    After the burghers were entrained and the long commando train was set in  motion the most fatiguing part of the campaign was before them. To ride on  a South African railway is a disagreeable duty in"]]]
