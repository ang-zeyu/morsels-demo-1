Perchance 'Abdu'l-Baha  may be put to death and his name be made to perish whereby an arena may be  opened unto the enemies of the Covenant wherein they may advance and spur  on their charger, inflict a grievous loss upon everyone and subvert the  very foundations of the edifice of the Cause of God. For so grievous is  the conduct and behavior of this false people that they are become even as  an axe striking at the very root of the Blessed Tree. Should they be  suffered to continue they would, in but a few days' time, exterminate the  Cause of God, His Word, and themselves.    Hence, the beloved of the Lord must entirely shun them, avoid them, foil  their machinations and evil whisperings, guard the Law of God and His  religion, engage one and all in diffusing widely the sweet savors of God  and to the best of their endeavor proclaim His Teachings.    Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to the diffusion of  the Light of Faith, let the loved ones give them counsel and say: \"Of all  the gifts of God the greatest is the gift of Teaching. It draweth unto us  the Grace of God and is our first obligation. Of such a gift how can we  deprive ourselves? Nay, our lives, our goods, our comforts, our rest, we  offer them all as a sacrifice for the Abha Beauty and teach the Cause of  God.\" Caution and prudence, however, must be observed even as recorded in  the Book. The veil must in no wise be suddenly rent asunder. The Glory of  Glories rest upon you.    O ye the faithful loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha! It is incumbent upon you to  take the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi, the twig that hath branched from  and the fruit given forth by the two hallowed and Divine Lote-Trees, that  no dust of despondency and sorrow may stain his radiant nature, that day  by day he may wax greater in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may  grow to become even as a fruitful tree.    For he is, after 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Guardian of the Cause of God, the  Afnan, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must  obey him and turn unto him. He that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God;  he that turneth away from him, hath turned away from God and he that  denieth him, hath denied the True One. Beware lest anyone falsely  interpret these words, and like unto them that have broken the Covenant  after the Day of Ascension (of Baha'u'llah) advance a pretext, raise the  standard of revolt, wax stubborn and open wide the door of false  interpretation. To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or  express his particular conviction. All must seek guidance and turn unto  the Center of the Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto  whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#6)"],[1,"posture wherein they had fallen at the edge of the  moat.    On the second night at midnight the Babis carried away the two bodies.    On the third day the people did not find the bodies, and some supposed  that the wild beasts had devoured them, so that the doctors proclaimed  from the summits of their pulpits saying, \"The holy body of the immaculate  Imam and that of the true _Sh_i'ite are preserved from the encroachments  of beasts of prey and creeping things and wounds, but the body of this  person have the wild beasts torn in pieces.\" But after the fullest  investigation and inquiry it hath been proved that when the Bab had  dispersed all His writings and personal properties and it had become clear  and evident from various signs that these events would shortly take place,  therefore, on the second day of these events, Sulayman _Kh_an the son of  Yahya _Kh_an, one of the nobles of A_dh_irbayjan devoted to the Bab,  arrived, and proceeded straightway to the house of the mayor of Tabriz.  And since the mayor was an old friend, associate, and confidant of his;  since, moreover, he was of the mystic temperament and did not entertain  aversion or dislike for any sect, Sulayman _Kh_an divulged this secret to  him saying, \"Tonight I, with several others, will endeavor by every means  and artifice to rescue the body. Even though it be not possible, come what  may we will make an attack, and either attain our object or pour out our  lives freely in this way.\" \"Such troubles,\" answered the mayor, \"are in no  wise necessary.\" He then sent one of his private servants named Haji  Allah-Yar, who, by whatever means and proceedings it was, obtained the  body without trouble or difficulty and handed it over to Haji Sulayman  _Kh_an. And when it was morning the sentinels, to excuse themselves, said  that the wild beasts had devoured it. That night they sheltered the body  in the workshop of a Babi of Milan: next day they manufactured a box,  placed it in the box, and left it as a trust. Afterwards, in accordance  with instructions which arrived from Tihran, they sent it away from  A_dh_irbayjan. And this transaction remained absolutely secret.    Now in these years [A.H. one thousand two hundred and] sixty-six and  sixty-seven throughout all Persia fire fell on the households of the  Babis, and each one of them, in whatever hamlet he might be, was, on the  slightest suspicion arising, put to the sword. More than four thousand  souls were slain, and a great multitude of women and children, left  without protector or helper, distracted and confounded, were trodden down  and destroyed. And all these occurrences were brought about solely by the  arbitrary decision and command of Mirza Taqi _Kh_an, who imagined that by  the enactment of a crushing punishment this sect would be dispersed and  disappear in such wise that all sign and knowledge of them would be cut  off. Ere long had passed the contrary of his imagination appeared, and it  became certain that [the Babis] were increasing. The flame rose higher and  the contagion became swifter: the affair waxed grave and the report  thereof reached other climes. At first it was confined to Persia: later it  spread to the rest of the world. Quaking and affliction resulted in  constancy and stability, and grievous pains and punishment caused  acceptance and attraction. The very events produced an impression;  impression led to investigation; and investigation resulted in increase.  Through the ill-considered policy of the Minister this edifice became  fortified and strengthened, and these foundations firm and solid.  Previously the matter used to be regarded as commonplace: subsequently it  acquired a grave importance in men's eyes. Many persons from all parts of  the world set out for Persia, and began to seek with their whole hearts.  For it hath been proved by experience in the world that in the case of  such matters of conscience laceration causeth healing; censure produceth  increased diligence; prohibition induceth eagerness; and intimidation  createth avidity. The root is hidden in the very heart, while the branch  is apparent and evident. When one branch is cut off other branches grow.  Thus it is observed that when such matters occur in other countries they  become extinct spontaneously through lack of attention and exiguity of  interest. For up to the present moment of movements pertaining to religion  many have appeared in the countries of Europe, but, noninterference and  absence of bigotry having deprived them of importance, in a little while  they became effaced and dispelled.    After this event there was wrought by a certain Babi a great error and a  grave presumption and crime, which has blackened the page of the history  of this sect and given it an ill name throughout the civilized world. Of  this event the marrow is this, that during the time when the Bab was  residing in A_dh_irbayjan a youth, Sadiq by name, became affected with the  utmost devotion to the Bab, night and day was busy in serving Him, and  became bereft of thought and reason. Now when that which befell the Bab in  Tabriz took place, this servant, actuated by his own fond fancies, fell  into thoughts of seeking blood-revenge. And since he knew naught of the  details of the events, the absolute autocracy of the Amir-Nizam, his  unbridled power, and sole authority; nor [was aware] that this sentence  had been promulgated absolutely without the cognizance of the Royal Court,  and that the Prime Minister had presumptuously issued the order on his own  sole responsibility; since, on the contrary, he supposed that agreeably to  ordinary custom and usage the attendants of the court had had a share in,  and a knowledge of this sentence, therefore, [impelled by] folly, frenzy,  and his evil star, nay, by sheer madness, he rose up from Tabriz and came  straight to Tihran, one other person being his accomplice. Then, since the  Royal Train had its abode in _Sh_imiran, he thither directed his steps.  God is our refuge! By him was wrought a deed so presumptuous that the  tongue is unable to declare and the pen loath to describe it. Yet to God  be praise and thankfulness that this madman had charged his pistol with  shot, imagining this to be preferable and superior to all projectiles.    Then all at once commotion arose, and this sect became of such ill repute  that still, strive and struggle as they may to escape from the curse and  disgrace and dishonor of this deed, they are unable to do so. They will  recount from the first manifestation of the Bab until the present time;  but when the thread of the discourse reaches this event they are abashed  and hang their heads in shame, repudiating the presumptuous actor and  accounting him the destroyer of the edifice and the cause of shame to  mankind.    Now after the occurrence of this grave matter all of this sect were  suspected. At first there was neither investigation nor inquiry, but  afterwards in mere justice it was decided that there should be  investigation, inquiry, and examination. All who were known to be of this  sect fell under suspicion. Baha'u'llah was passing the summer in the  village of Af_ch_ih situated one stage from Tihran. When this news was  spread abroad and punishment began, everyone who was able hid himself in  some retreat or fled the country. Amongst these Mirza Yahya, the brother  of Baha'u'llah, concealed himself, and, a bewildered fugitive, in the  guise of a dervish, with ka_sh_kul in hand, wandered in mountains and  plains on the road to Ra_sh_t. But Baha'u'llah rode forth with perfect  composure and calmness from Af_ch_ih, and came to Niyavaran, which was the  abode of the Royal Train and the station of the imperial camp. Immediately  on His arrival He was placed under arrest, and a whole regiment guarded  Him closely. After several days of interrogation they sent Him in chains  and fetters from _Sh_imiran to the jail of Tihran. And this harshness and  punishment was due to the immoderate importunity of Haji 'Ali _Kh_an, the  Hajibu'd-Dawlih, nor did there seem any hope of deliverance, until His  Majesty the King, moved by his own kindly spirit, commanded  circumspection, and ordered this occurrence to be investigated and  examined particularly and generally by means of the ministers of the  imperial court.    Now when Baha'u'llah was interrogated on this matter He answered in reply,  \"The event itself indicates the truth of the affair and testifies that  this is the action of a thoughtless, unreasoning, and ignorant man. For no  reasonable person would charge his pistol with shot when embarking on so  grave an enterprise. At least he would so arrange and plan it that the  deed should be orderly and systematic. From the very nature of the event  it is clear and evident as the sun that it is not the act of such as  Myself.\"    So it was established and proven that the assassin had on his own  responsibility engaged in this grievous action and monstrous deed with the  idea and design of taking blood revenge for his Master, and that it  concerned no one else. And when the truth of the matter became evident the  innocence of Baha'u'llah from this suspicion was established in such wise  that no doubt remained for anyone; the decision of the court declared His  purity and freedom from this charge; and it became apparent and clear that  what had been done with regard to Him was due to the efforts of His foes  and the hasty folly of the Hajibu'd-Dawlih. Therefore did the government  of eternal duration desire to restore certain properties and estates which  had been confiscated, that thereby it might pacify Him. But since the  chief part of these was lost and only an inconsiderable portion was  forthcoming, none came forward to claim them. Indeed Baha'u'llah requested  permission to withdraw to the Supreme Shrines(15) [of Karbila and Najaf]  and, after some months, by the royal permission and with the leave of the  Prime Minister,"]]]
