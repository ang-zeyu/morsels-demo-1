(_with sobbing voice_.)    Art thou then dead?  Liv'st thou not?  Hast to the curse succumbed?--    (_He listens for_ TRISTAN'S _breath_.)    O rapture! No!  He still moves! He lives!  and gently his lips are stirr'd.    TRISTAN (_very faintly_). The ship--is't yet in sight?    KURVENAL. The ship? Be sure  t'will come to-day:  it cannot tarry longer.    TRISTAN. On board Isolda,--  see, she smiles--  with the cup  that reconciles.  Dost thou see?  Dost thou see her now?  Full of grace  and loving mildness,  floating o'er  the ocean's wildness?  By billows of flowers  lightly lifted,  gently toward  the land she's drifted.  Her look brings ease  and sweet repose;  her hand one last  relief bestows.  Isolda! Ah, Isolda!  How fair, how sweet art thou!--  And Kurvenal, why!--  what ails thy sight?  Away, and watch for her,  foolish I see so well and plainly,  let not thine eye seek vainly  Dost thou not hear?  Away, with speed!  Haste to the watch-tow'r!  Wilt thou not heed?  The ship, the ship!  Isolda's ship!--  Thou must discern it,  must perceive it!  The ship--dost thou see it?--    (_Whilst_ KURVENAL, _still hesitating, opposes_ TRISTAN,  _the Shepherd's pipe is heard without, playing a joyous strain_.)    KURVENAL (_springing joyously up_).  O rapture! Transport!    (_He rushes to the watch-tower and looks out_.)    Ha! the ship!  From northward it is nearing.    TRISTAN. So I knew,  so I said!  Yes, she yet lives,  and life to me gives.  How could Isold'  from this world be free,  which only holds  Isolda for me?    KURVENAL (_shouting_). Ahoy! Ahoy!  See her bravely tacking!  How full the canvas is filled!  How she darts! how she flies!    TRISTAN. The pennon? the pennon?    KURVENAL. A flag is floating at mast-head,  joyous and bright.    TRISTAN. Aha! what joy!  Now through the daylight  comes my Isolda.  Isolda, oh come!  See'st thou herself?    KURVENAL. The ship is shut  from me by rocks.    TRISTAN. Behind the reef?  Is there not risk!  Those dangerous breakers  ships have oft shattered.--  Who steereth the helm?    KURVENAL. The steadiest seaman.    TRISTAN. Betrays he me?  Is he Melot's ally?    KURVENAL. Trust him like me.    TRISTAN. A traitor thou, too!--  O caitiff!  Canst thou not see her?    KURVENAL. Not yet.    TRISTAN. Destruction!    KURVENAL. Aha! Halla-halloa I  they clear! they clear!  Safely they clear!  Inside the surf  steers now the ship to the strand.    TRISTAN (_shouting in joy_). Hallo-ho! Kurvenal!  Trustiest friend!  All the wealth I own  to-day I bequeath thee.    KURVENAL. With speed they approach.    TRISTAN. Now dost thou see her?  See'st thou Isolda?    KURVENAL. 'Tis she! she waves!    TRISTAN. O woman divine!    KURVENAL. The ship is a-land!  Isolda.'--ha!--  With but one leap  lightly she springs to land!    TRISTAN. Descend from the watch-tow'r,  indolent gazer!  Away! away  to the shore!  Help her! help my belov'd!    KURVENAL. In a trice she shall come;  Trust in my strong arm!  But thou, Tristan,  hold thee tranquilly here!    (_He hastens off_.)    TRISTAN (_tossing on his couch in feverish excitement_).  O sunlight glowing,  glorious ray!  Ah, joy-bestowing  radiant day!  Boundeth my blood,  boisterous flood!  Infinite gladness!  Rapturous madness!  Can I bear to lie  couched here in quiet?  Away, let me fly  to where hearts run riot!  Tristan the brave,  exulting in strength,  has torn himself  from death at length.    (_He raises himself erect_.)    All wounded and bleeding  Sir Morold I defeated;  all bleeding and wounded  Isolda now shall be greeted.    (_He tears the bandage from his wound_.)    Ha, ha, my blood!  Merrily flows it.    (_He springs from his bed and staggers forward_.)    She who can help  my wound and close it,  she comes in her pride,  she comes to my aid.  Be space defied:  let the universe fade!    (_He reels to the centre of the stage_.)    ISOLDA'S VOICE (_without_).  Tristan! Tristan! Beloved!    TRISTAN (_in frantic excitement_).  What! hails me the light?  The torchlight--ha!--  The torch is extinct!  I come! I come!      SCENE II.    [ISOLDA _hastens breathlessly in_. TRISTAN, _delirious with  excitement, staggers wildly towards her. They meet in the centre of  the stage; she receives him in her arms, where he sinks slowly to the  ground_.]    ISOLDA. Tristan! Ah!    TRISTAN (_turning, his dying eyes on_ ISOLDA). Isolda!--    (_He dies_.)    ISOLDA. 'Tis I, 'tis I--  dearly belov'd!  Wake, and once more  hark to my voice!  Isolda calls.  Isolda comes,  with Tristan true to perish.--  Speak unto me!  But for one moment,  only one moment  open thine eyes!  Such weary days  I waited and longed,  that one single hour  I with thee might awaken.  Betrayed am I then?  Deprived by Tristan  of this our solitary,  swiftly fleeting,  final earthly joy?--  His wound, though--where?  Can I not heal it?  The rapture of night  O let us feel it?  Not of thy wounds,  not of thy wounds must thou expire!  Together, at least,  let fade life's enfeebled fire!--  How lifeless his look!--  still his heart!--  Dared he to deal me  Buch a smart?  Stayed is his breathing's  gentle tide!  Must I be wailing  at his side,  who, in rapture coming to seek him,  fearless sailed o'er the sea?  Too late, too late!  Desperate man!  Casting on me  this cruelest ban!  Comes no relief  for my load of grief?  Silent art keeping  while I am weeping?  But once more, ah!  But once again!--  Tristan!--ha!  he wakens--hark!  Beloved--  --dark!    (_She sinks down senseless upon his body_.)      SCENE III.    [KURVENAL, _who reentered close behind_ ISOLDA, _has remained  by the entrance speechless and petrified, gazing motionless on_  TRISTAN. _From below is now heard the dull murmur of voices and the  clash of weapons. The Shepherd clambers over the wall_.]    SHEPHERD (_coming hastily and softly to_ KURVENAL).  Kurvenal! Hear!  Another ship!    (KURVENAL _starts up in haste and looks over the rampart, whilst  the Shepherd stands apart, gazing in consternation on_ TRISTAN  _and_ ISOLDA.)    KURVENAL. Fiends and furies!    (_In a burst of anger_.)    All are at hand!  Melot and Mark  I see on the strand,--  Weapons and missiles!--  Guard we the gate!    (_He hastens with the Shepherd to the gate, which they both try  quickly to barricade_.)    THE STEERSMAN (_rushing in_).  Mark and his men  have set on us:  defence is vain!  We're overpowered.    KURVENAL. Stand to and help!--  While lasts my life  I'll let no foe enter here!    BRANGAENA'S VOICE (_without, calling from below_).  Isolda! Mistress!    KURVENAL. Brangaena's voice! (_Falling down_.)  What want you here?    BRANGAENA. Open, Kurvenal!  Where is Isolda?    KURVENAL. With foes do you come?  Woe to you, false one!    MELOT'S VOICE (_without_). Stand back, thou fool!  Bar not the way!    KURVENAL (_laughing savagely_). Hurrah for the day  on which I confront thee!    (MELOT, _with armed men, appears under the gateway_.  KURVENAL _falls on him and cuts him down_.)    Die, damnable wretch!      SCENE IV.    MELOT. Woe's me!--Tristan! (_He dies_.)    BRANGAENA (_still without_). Kurvenal! Madman!  O hear--thou mistakest!    KURVENAL. Treacherous maid! (_To his men_.)  Come! Follow me!  Force them below! (_They fight_.)    MARK (_without_). Hold, thou frantic man!  Lost are thy senses?    KURVENAL. Here ravages Death!  Nought else, O king,  is here to be holden!  If you would earn it, come on!    (_He sets upon_ MARK _and his followers_.)    MARK. Away, rash maniac!    BRANGAENA (_has climbed over the wall at the side and hastens in the  front_).  Isolda! lady!  Joy and life!--  What sight's here--ha!  Liv'st thou, Isolda! (_She goes to_ ISOLDA'S _aid_.)    MARK (_who with his followers has driven_ KURVENAL _and his men  back from the gate and forced his way in_).O wild mistake!  Tristan, where art thou?    KURVENAL (_desperately wounded, totters before_ MARK _to the  front_).  He lieth--there--  here, where I lie too.--    (_Sinks down at_ TRISTAN'S _feet_.)    MARK. Tristan! Tristan!  Isolda! Woe!    KURVENAL (_trying to grasp_ TRISTAN'S _hand_).  Tristan! true lord!  Chide me not  that I try to follow thee! (_He dies_.)    MARK. Dead together!--  All are dead!  My hero Tristan!  truest of friends,  must thou again  be to thy king a traitor?  Now, when he comes  another proof of love to give thee!  Awaken! awaken.  O hear my lamentation,  thou faithless, faithful friend!    (_Kneels down sobbing over the bodies_.)    BRANGAENA (_who has revived_ ISOLDA _in her arms_).  She wakes! she lives!  Isolda, hear!  Hear me, mistress beloved!  Tidings of joy  I have to tell thee:  O list to thy Brangaena!  My thoughtless fault I have atoned;  after thy flight  I forthwith went to the king:  the love potion's secret  he scarce had learned  when with sedulous haste  he put to sea,  that he might find thee,  nobly renounce thee  and give thee up to thy love.    MARK. O why, Isolda,  Why this to me?  When clearly was disclosed  what before I could fathom not,  what joy was mine to find  my friend was free from fault!  In haste to wed  thee to my hero  with flying sails  I followed thy track:  but howe'er can  happiness  o'ertake the swift course of woe?  More food for Death did I make:  more wrong grew in mistake.    BRANGAENA. Dost thou not hear?  Isolda! Lady!  O try to believe the truth!    ISOLDA (_unconscious of all around her, turning her eyes with,  rising inspiration on_ TRISTAN'S _body_).  Mild and softly  he is smiling;  how his eyelids sweetly open!  See, oh comrades,  see you not  how he beameth  ever brighter--  how he rises  ever radiant  steeped in starlight,  borne above?  See you not  how his heart  with lion zest,  calmly happy  beats in his breast?  From his lips  in heavenly rest  sweetest breath  he softly sends.  Harken, friends!  Hear and feel ye not?  Is it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16251"],[0,"A Book for Kids (#6)"],[1," Now then!\" roared the man with the large ears. \"Move  yourself there, Goldie! We shut up the show here in a few minutes, and  open at once on the next range. See that you have that curtain down on  time.\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" replied the little yellow man very humbly.    Then the man with the large ears noticed Neville for the first time.  He frowned darkly, and his big ears seemed to flap with annoyance.    \"Who is this on our Cloud Horse?\" he roared in his great angry voice.    \"Just a little boy,\" said the yellow man--for Neville was far too  frightened to speak. \"Just a little boy that the Cloud Horse has been  playing tricks on. I think he'd like to be getting home--just over by  the bald hill, if you don't mind, sir.\"    \"Certainly not!\" shouted the man with the large ears. \"The Cloud Horse  is not to go out there again to-night, nor the silly little boy  either. I'm not going to have the sunset upset by any such silly  nonsense. You mind what I say and attend to your work.\"    And, without another glance at Neville, the man with the large ears  strode off to arrange for the sunset on the next range, miles and  miles away.    Neville gazed at the wee yellow man hopelessly, and the wee yellow man  gazed at Neville, and neither spoke a word until the man with the  large ears was well out of the way. Then the Last Sunbeam grew quite  cheerful again.    \"Well,\" said he, \"you heard what the head scene-shifter said. You  certainly can't go home by the way you came. The only thing for you to  do is to go round. You'll just about have time to do it, if you  hurry.\"    \"Go round?\" repeated Neville in a puzzled voice. \"Go round what, round  where?\"    \"Round the world, of course,\" replied the little yellow man.    \"Round the world?\" cried Neville. \"Why you must be making fun of me,  and I think that is very unkind.\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" laughed the little yellow man. \"You need not make  such as fuss about it. Why, I go round the world once every day with  the sunset. You have only to go a bit faster so as to do it in a few  minutes, and with the Cloud Horse to help you that's easily managed.  Don't you worry about the Cloud Horse. He has got to do just whatever I  tell him. Now, excuse me for one moment and I'll give you full  directions.\"    With that the wee yellow man went behind a pink cloud and came  back with a beautiful blue flower in his hand.    \"This,\" he said, handing the flower to Neville, \"is a Sky Flower. It  is made entirely out of a genuine piece of sky, and it is a  talisman--that's a longer word for charm, you know--which takes you  free round the world. The one thing you have to remember is that you  mustn't, on any account, lose that flower until you get home again.  Now, just exactly what you have to do is to travel West and race round  the world until you catch up with this evening again. It is quite  simple.\"    \"Simple!\" cried Neville. \"Why I don't understand it at all.\"    \"Dear me!\" said the wee yellow man rather impatiently, \"you are very  dense. Now listen carefully. The world, you know, turns round from  West to East, and that makes it seem as if the sun is going round the  world from East to West. Very well. So what you have to do is to ride  West upon the Cloud horse much faster than the sun appears to travel,  and catch him up again before he gets well away from here. The Cloud  horse is in good condition, and you should easily do it in a few  minutes.\"    \"A few minutes!\" gasped Neville.    \"Keep quiet and listen,\" snapped the wee yellow man. \"A few miles West  from here you will come into broad daylight. That will be afternoon.  After that you will meet mid-day, and, passing that, you will reach  the place where it is only dawn. That's about half-way round the  earth. Show the Sky Flower to the porter of the Dawn, and he will let  you through. Then you get to the half of the world where it is night,  and you must race round that till you reach the place where it is only  evening. That will be THIS evening, somewhere about here, for you will  have taken only a few minutes altogether. And when you see your own  home or the bald hill again, grasp the Sky Flower tightly in your  hand, jump off the Cloud horse, and you will float gracefully down to  the earth. It won't hurt you. Then you can go home, and I hope you  will not be late for dinner.\"    \"But,\" began Neville, \"I can't understand--\"    \"My time is valuable,\" said the wee yellow man, as he shook hands.  \"Good-bye, and a pleasant journey.\" With that he smacked the Cloud  Horse smartly on the flank, and in a moment it was racing into the  West at a most terrific pace.    Of course, now that aeroplanes have been invented, flying is not  thought so wonderful as once it was. But loafing along through the air  in a biplane or a monoplane at eighty or a hundred miles an hour is a  very tame business when you compare it with racing the day round the  world on a Cloud horse. And Neville is very probably the only person  who has ever done that yet.    Almost before he knew what had happened, he had left evening far  behind and was riding in broad daylight. The cloud Horse had ridden  high in the air, and Neville saw the broad country, with plains and  hills and forest lands, stretched far beneath him. An instant later,  and the land was no longer below him, but the wide sea, sparkling in  brilliant sunlight.    Before he had time to notice very much he had reached mid-day, high  over a strange foreign land, and was racing through the morning toward  the dawn. So quickly did he go that there was little chance of seeing  anything clearly; but he had glimpses of many strange sights. Many  ships he saw upon the sea--small ships and stately steamers crawling  over the ocean like strange water-beetles. Once, as the Cloud Horse  drifted low, Neville saw a beautiful sailing-ship, with all sails set,  and strange-looking men upon the deck. They looked very like pirates,  and perhaps they were; but Neville had no time to make sure, for the  very next minute he was over a wild land where he saw a horde of black  men, with spears and clubs, hunting an elephant through a clearing in  a great jungle. As he looked, the elephant turned to charge the  hunters; but what happened then Neville did not see, for in a moment  more he was above a great city with crowds of people in the  streets--people dressed in strange, bright-coloured clothes--and there  were bells ringing and whistles blowing. Then a great desert spread  beneath him, with no living thing in sight but a great tawny lion  prowling over the sand. Then came the sea again, and more ships; and  the light began to grow dim, for he was nearly half-way round the  earth, and was approaching the dawn.    Dimmer grew the light, and dimmer yet, just as though evening were  coming--and before him, Neville saw the dawn like a silvery gateway in  the sky. Straight toward it the Cloud Horse rushed, and stopped so  suddenly that Neville almost fell off.    \"What's all this? What's all this?\" cried a small voice; and Neville  saw beside the silver gateway, a little man dressed from top to toe in  silver grey. It was the Porter of the Dawn, sometimes called the First  Sunbeam.    Before Neville could answer, the little grey man had caught sight of  the Sky Flower.    \"Ah, you have the talisman,\" said he. \"Pass in! and don't stop to  gossip, because I'm very busy this morning. A pleasant journey,\" he  added as he smacked the cloud horse on the shoulder; and in an instant  Neville had passed through the dawn and plunged into the night.    It was a dark night, with no moon, for the sky was overcast with dense  clouds. Above these the Cloud horse flew, and overhead Neville saw the  rushing stars, and below only the blackness of heavy clouds. But more  often the Cloud horse flew low, and then there was little to be seen.  By the lights of moving ships Neville knew that sometimes he was above  the sea. Sometimes twinkling lights in towns or solitary farms, or the  sudden blaze of a great city told him that the land was beneath him.  Once, through the blackness, he saw a great forest fire upon an  island, and the light of it lit up the sea, and showed the natives  crowded upon the beach and in the shallows, and some making off in  canoes.    Then darkness swallowed the Cloud Horse again, and the blazing island  was left far behind.    After that, Neville began to feel a little drowsy. Perhaps he did  sleep a little, for the next thing he saw was a faint light in the sky  before him, as though the dawn were coming. But he knew it must be the  evening, because he was coming back to the place from which he had  started, and was catching up with the sun. You see, he had only been  gone a few minutes.    The Cloud Horse flew very low now; and rapidly the darkness grew less.  Then, long before he expected it, Neville saw the roof of his own home  below him. He could see the garden in the twilight and his own dog  sniffing about among the trees as though in search of him.    Neville began to think about jumping now, and he was rather nervous.  He might land softly and he might not. He only had the wee yellow  man's word for that.    Then, to his horror, he saw that they had passed his home and were  over the bald hill. There was no time to lose. The Cloud Horse was  taking him into the sunset again, and, if he did, what would the head  scene-shifter say then?    So, grasping the Sky Flower very tightly, Neville closed his eyes and  jumped. He half expected to fall quickly and be dashed to pieces upon  the earth; but, instead, he floated in the air like a feather, swaying  and drifting, and slowly sinking all the time towards the ground. It  was a very pleasant sensation indeed.    The bald hill was beneath him as he came slowly down, down, down.    He could see the Cloud Horse--now little more than a small white  speck--rushing on to catch the sunset. And still he sank down ever so  slowly towards the top of the bald"]]]
