If you will have it of an Amber colour,  then boil it with a quick fire, that is all the difference of the  colouring of it.        _To make Marmalet of Oranges, or Orange Cakes, &c._    Take the yellowest and fairest Oranges, and water them three days,  shifting the water twice a day, pare them as thin as you possible can,  boil them in a water changed five or six times, until the bitterness of  the Orange be boiled out, those that you preserve must be cut in halves,  but those for Marmalet must be boiled whole, let them be very tender,  and slice them very thin on a Trencher, taking out the seeds and long  strings, and with a Knife make it as fine as the Pap of an Apple; then  weigh your Pap of Oranges, and to a pound of it, take a pound and a half  of sugar; then you must have Pippins boiled ready in a skillet of fair  water, and take the pap of them made fine on a Trencher, and the strings  taken out, (but take not half so much Pippins as Oranges) then take the  weight of it in sugar, and mix it both together in a Silver or Earthen  Dish; and set it on the coals to dry the water out of it, (as you do  with Quince Marmalet) when your sugar is Candy height, put in your  stuff, and boil it till you think it stiff enough, stirring it  continually: if you please you may put a little Musk in it.            Touching Pastrey and Pasties.      _To make Sugar Cakes._    Take three pound of the finest Wheat Flower, one pound of fine Sugar,  Cloves, and Mace of each one ounce finely searsed, two pound of butter,  a little Rose-water, knead and mould this very well together, melt your  butter as you put it in;

 boil the liquor likewise in another Posnet, then put them seething hot  together, and so boil a little while stirring them together, then put  them into glasses, and set them in an Oven or Stove in a drying heat,  let them stand so two or three weeks, and never be cold, removing them  from one warm place to another, they will turn in a week; beware you set  them not too hot, for they will be tough; so every day turn them till  they be dry; they will be very clear.        _To make Paste of Oranges and Lemons._    Take your Oranges well coloured, boil them tender in water, changing  them six or seven times in the boiling, put into the first water one  handful of Salt, and then beat them in a wooden bowl with a wooden  Pestle, and then strain them through a piece of Cushion Canvas, then  take somewhat more than the weight of them in Sugar, then boil it, dry  and fashion it as you please.        _To make Rasberry Cakes._    Take Rasberries, and put them into a Gallipot, cover them close, and set  them into a skillet of water, and let them boil till they are all to  mash, then rub them through a strainer of Cushion Canvas, put the liquor  into a silver bason, and set it upon a very quick fire; and put into it  one handful or two of whole Rasberries, according to the quantity of  your liquor; and as you shall like to have seeds in your paste: Thus let  it boyl very fast till it be thick; and continually stir, lest it burn;  then take two silver dishes that are of a weight, and put them into your  scales, in the one put the Raspiss stuffe, and in the other double  refined Sugar finely beaten, as much as the weight of Raspiss stuff;  then put as much water to the sugar as will melt it, set it upon the  fire, and let it boil till it be very high candied, then take it from  the fire, and put your Raspiss stuff into it; and when your Sugar and  Rasberries are very well mixt together, and the sugar well melted from  about the dish, (which if it will not do from the fire, set it on again)  but let it not boil in any case; when it is pretty cool, lay it by  spoonfuls in places, and put it into your stuff, keeping temperate fire  to it twice a day till it be candied that will turn them, joyn two of  the pieces together, to make the cakes the thicker.        _To make Paste of Genoa Citrons._    Take Citrons, & boil them in their skins, then scrape all the pulp from  the core, strain it through a piece of Cushion Canvas, take twice the  weight of the pulp in Sugar, put to it twice as much water as will melt  it that is half a pint to every pound of Sugar, boil it to a Candy  height; dry the Pulp upon a Chafing-dish of Coales, then put the syrup  and the Pulp hot together, boil it with stirring until it will lye upon  a Pye-plate, set it in a warm stone Oven upon two billets of wood, from  the heat of the Oven, all one night, in the morning turn it, and set it  in the like heat again, so turn it every day till it be dry.        _To make a French Tart._    Take a quarter of Almonds or thereabouts, and peel them, then beat them  in a mortar, take the white of the breast of a cold Capon, and take so  much Lard as twice the quantity of the Capon, and so much Butter, or  rather more, and half a Marrow-bone, and if the bone be little then all  the Marrow, with the juyce of one Lemon; beat them all together in a  Mortar very well, then put in one half pound of loaf sugar grated, then  take a good piece of Citron, cut it in small pieces, and half a quarter  of Pistanius, mingle all these together, take some flour, and the yolks  of two or three Eggs, and some sweet Butter, and work it with cold  water.        _To make Cakes of Pear Plums._    Take a pound of the clear, or the Pulp, a pound of Sugar, and boil it to  a Sugar again, then break it as small as you can, and put in the clear,  when your Sugar is melted in it, and almost cold, put it in glass  plates, and set them into your stove as fast as you can, with coals  under them, and so twice a day whilst they be dry enough to cut; if you  make them of the clear, you must make paste of Apples to lay upon them,  you must scald them, and beat them very well, and so use them as you do  your Plums, and then you may put them into what fashion you please.        _To make Cakes, viz._    Take a pound of Sugar finely beaten, four yolks of Eggs, two whites, one  half pound of Butter washt in Rose-water, six spoonfuls of sweet Cream  warmed, one pound of Currans well pickt, as much flower as will make it  up, mingle them well together, make them into Cakes, bake them in an  Oven;

let not your Oven  be too hot.        _To make Paste of Apricocks._    Take your Apricock, & pare them, and stone them, then boil them tender  betwixt two dishes on a Chafing-dish of coals; then being cold, lay it  forth on a white sheet of paper; then take as much sugar as it doth  weigh, & boil it to a candy height, with as much Rose-water and fair  water as will melt the sugar; then put the pulp into the Sugar, and so  let it boil till it be as thick as for Marmalet, now and then stirring  of it;

I. DEATH OF FRANKLIN.  (To be read in a solemn tone.)    Franklin is dead. The genius who freed America', and poured a  copious stream of knowledge throughout Europe', is returned unto the bosom  of the Divinity'. The sage to whom two worlds' lay claim, the man for whom  science' and politics' are disputing, indisputably enjoyed au elevated  rank in human nature.    The cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of notifying the death  of those who were great', only in their funeral orations'. Long hath the  etiquette of courts', proclaimed the mourning of hypocrisy'. Nations'  should wear mourning for none but their benefactors'. The representatives'  of nations should recommend to public homage' only those who have been the  heroes of humanity'.      II. BONAPARTE.    He knew no motive' but interst'; acknowledged no criterion' but success';  he worshiped no God' but ambition'; and with an eastern devotion', he  knelt at the shrine of his idolatry'. Subsidiary to this, there was no  creed' that he did not profess'; there was no opinion' that he did not  promulgate': in the hope of a dynasty', he upheld the crescent'; for the  sake of a divorce', he bowed before the cross'; the orphan of St. Louis',  he became the adopted child of the republic'; and, with a parricidal  ingrati-tude', on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune, he reared  the throne of his despotism'.    At his touch crowns' crumbled'; beggars' reigned'; systems' van-ished';  the wildest theories' took the color of his whim'; and all that was  venerable' and all that was novel', changed places with the rapidity of a  drama'. Nature had no obstacle' that he did not surmount'; space, no  opposition' he did not spurn'; and whether amid Alpine rocks',--Arabian  sands',--or Polar snows',---he seemed proof' against peril', and empowered  with ubiquity'.        III. HAMLET ON SEEING THE SKULL OF YORICK.    Alas, poor Yorick'! I knew him', Horatio'; a fellow of infinite jest', of  most excellent fancy'. He hath borne me on his back' a thousand times';  and now', how abhorred my imagination is'! My gorge rises' at it. Here  hung those lips that I have kissed', I know not how oft', Where be your  gibes' now? your gambols'? your songs'? your flashes of merriment', that  were wont to set the table on a roar'? Not one', now, to mock your own  grinning'? quite chopfallen'? Now get you to my lady's chamber' and tell  her', let her paint an inch thick' to this favor' she must come'; make her  laugh at that'.        IV. DESCRIPTION OF A BATTLE.    Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew'  With wavering flight', while fiercer grew    Around, the battle yell.  The border slogan rent the sky',  A Home'! a Gordon'! was the cry';    Loud' were the clanging blows';  Advanced',--forced back',--now low',--now high',    The pennon sunk'--and rose';  As bends the bark's mast in the gale',  When rent are rigging', shrouds', and sail',    It wavered 'mid the foes'.  The war, that for a space did fail',  Now trebly thundering swelled the gale',    And Stanley'! was the cry;  A light on Marmion's visage spread',    And fired his glazing eye':--  With dying' hand', above his head',  He shook the fragment of his blade',    And shouted',--\"Victory'!  Charge', Chester', charge'! On' Stanley', on'!\"--    Were the last words of Marmion.        V. LORD ULLIN'S DAUGHTER.    For the inflections and emphasis in this selection, let the pupil be  guided by his own judgment.    A chieftain to the Highlands bound,    Cries, \"Boatman, do not tarry!  And I'll give thee a silver pound,    To row us o'er the ferry.\"    \"Now, who be ye would cross Loch-Gyle    This dark and stormy water?\"  \"Oh! I'm the chief of Ulva's isle,    And this, Lord Ullin's daughter.    \"And fast before her father's men    Three days we've fled together,  For should he find us in the glen,    My blood would stain the heather.    \"His horsemen hard behind us ride;    Should they our steps discover,  Then who will cheer my bonny bride,    When they have slain her lover?\"    Out spoke the hardy Highland wight    \"I'll go, my chief--I'm ready:  It is not for your silver bright,    But for your winsome lady:    \"And, by my word! the bonny bird    In danger shall not tarry;  So, though the waves are raging white,    I'll row you o'er the ferry.\"    By this, the storm grew loud apace,    The water wraith was shrieking;  And, in the scowl of heaven, each face    Grew dark as they were speaking.    But still, as wilder grew the wind,    And as the night grew drearer,  Adown the glen rode armed men,    Their trampling sounded nearer.    \"Oh I haste thee, haste!\" the lady cries    \"Though tempest round us gather,  I'll meet the raging of the skies,    But not an angry father.\"    The boat has left the stormy land,    A stormy sea before her;  When, oh I too strong for human hand,    The tempest gathered o'er her.    And still they rowed, amid the roar    Of waters fast prevailing;  Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore,    His wrath was changed to wailing.    For sore dismay through storm and shade    His child he did discover;  One lovely hand she stretched for aid,    And one was round her lover.    \"Come back! come back!\" he cried, in grief,    \"Across this stormy water;  And I'll forgive your Highland chief,    My daughter! O, my daughter!\"    'T was vain: the loud waves lashed the shore,    Return or aid preventing;  The waters wild went o'er his child,    And he was left lamenting.                                 --Thomas Campbell        ALPHABETICAL LIST OF AUTHORS.

It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he was  seated one day in his private room, a written petition was brought to him  with the request that it should be immediately read.  The King had just  returned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some other cause, had  so dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make out a single word  of the writing.    2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who  brought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy  servant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was a  son of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor  reader.    3. In the first place, he did not articulate distinctly. He huddled his  words together in the utterance, as if they were syllables of one long  word, which he must get through with as speedily as possible. His  pronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate his voice so as to bring  out the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was uttered with a dismal  monotony of voice, as if it did not differ in any respect from that which  preceded it.    4. \"Stop!\" said the King, impatiently. \"Is it an auctioneer's list of  goods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to me.\"  Another page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave  the petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his throat in  such an affected manner that the King jokingly asked him whether he had  not slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the night before.    5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so was  not greatly confused by the King's jest. He determined that he would avoid  the mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading the  petition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word, and  prolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so  tedious that the King cried out, \"Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the  elementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send"]]]
