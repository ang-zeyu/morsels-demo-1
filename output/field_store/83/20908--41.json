It  is probable, however, that the idea of weaving complex ideographic  characters would not occur to the primitive mind at a very early date,  and a long period of progress would elapse before delineative subjects  would be attempted.    I do not need to follow this style of combination into the more  refined kinds of work and into loom products, but may add that through  all, until perverted by ulterior influences, the characteristic  geometricity and monotonous repetition are allpervading.           *       *       *       *       *    For the purpose of looking still more closely into the tendencies of  normal textile decorative development I shall present a series of  Indian baskets, choosing mainly from the closely woven or impacted  varieties because they are so well represented in our collections and  at the same time are so very generally embellished with designs in  color; besides, they are probably among the most simple and primitive  textile products known. I have already shown that several types of  combination when closely impacted produce very similar surface  characters and encourage the same general style of decoration. In  nearly all, the color features are confined to one series of  fillets--those of the woof--the other, the warp, being completely  hidden from view. In the preceding series the warp and woof were  almost equally concerned in the expression of design. Here but one is  used, and in consequence there is much freedom of expression, as the  artist carries the colored filaments back and forth or inserts new  ones at will. Still it will be seen that in doing this he is by no  means free; he must follow the straight and narrow pathway laid down  by the warp and woof, and, do what he may, he arrives at purely  geometric results.    [Illustration: FIG. 319. Base of coiled basket showing the method of  building by dual coiling. The base or warp coil is composed of  untwisted fiber and is formed by adding to the free end as the coiling  goes on. The woof or binding filament, as it is coiled, is caught into  the upper surface of the preceding turn--1/8.]    [Illustration: FIG. 320. Coiled basket with simple geometric ornament.  Work of the northwest coast Indians--1/8.]    I will now present the examples, which for the sake of uniformity are  in all cases of the coiled ware. If a basket is made with no other  idea than that of use the surface is apt to be pretty uniform in  color, the natural color of the woof fillets. If decoration is desired  a colored fillet is introduced, which, for the time, takes the place  and does the duty of the ordinary strand. Fig. 319 serves to show the  construction and surface appearance of the base of a coil made vessel  still quite free from any color decoration. Now, if it is desired to  begin a design, the plain wrapping thread is dropped and a colored  fillet is inserted and the coiling continues. Carried once around the  vessel we have an encircling line of dark color corresponding to the  lower line of the ornament seen in Fig. 320. If the artist is content  with a single line of color he sets the end of the dark thread and  takes up the light colored one previously dropped and continues the  coiling. If further elaboration is desired it is easily accomplished.  In the example given the workman has taken up the dark fillet again  and carried it a few times around the next turn of the warp coil; then  it has been dropped and the white thread taken up, and again, in turn,  another dark thread has been introduced and coiled for a few turns,  and so on until four encircling rows of dark, alternating rectangles  have been produced. Desiring to introduce a meandered design he has  taken the upper series of rectangles as bases and adding colored  filaments at the proper time has carried oblique lines, one to the  right and the other to the left, across the six succeeding ridges of  the warp coil. The pairs of stepped lines meeting above were joined in  rectangles like those below, and the decoration was closed by a border  line at the top. The vessel was then completed in the light colored  material. In this ornament all forms are bounded by two classes of  lines, vertical and horizontal (or, viewed from above or below, radial  and encircling), the lines of the warp and the woof. Oblique bands of  color are made up of series of rectangles, giving stepped outlines.  Although these figures are purely geometric, it is not impossible that  in their position and grouping they preserve a trace of some imitative  conception modified to this shape by the forces of the art. They serve  quite as well, however, to illustrate simple mechanical elaboration as  if entirely free from suspicion of associated ideas.    [Illustration: FIG. 321. Coiled basket with encircling bands of  ornament in white, red, and black, upon a yellowish ground. Obtained  from the Indians of the Tule River, California--1/8.]    In Fig. 321 I present a superb piece of work executed by the Indians  of the Tule River, California. It is woven in the closely impacted,  coiled style. The ornament is arranged in horizontal zones and  consists of a series of diamond shaped figures in white with red  centers and black frames set side by side. The processes of  substitution where changes of color are required are the same as in  the preceding case and the forms of figures and the disposition of  designs are the same, being governed by the same forces.    [Illustration: FIG. 322. Coiled basket with ornament arranged in  zigzag rays. Obtained from the Pima Indians of Arizona--1/8.]    Another choice piece, from the Pima Indians of Arizona, is given in  Fig. 322. The lines of the ornament adhere exclusively to the  directions imposed by the warp and the woof, the stripes of black  color ascending with the turns of the fillet for a short distance,  then for a time following the horizontal ridges, and again ascending,  the complete result being a series of zigzag rays set very close  together. These rays take an oblique turn to the left, and the dark  figures at the angles, from the necessities of construction, form rows  at right angles to these. A few supplementary rays are added toward  the margin to fill out the widening spaces. Another striking example  of the domination of technique over design is illustrated in Fig. 323.    [Illustration: FIG. 323. Coiled basket with two bands of meandered  ornament. Obtained from the Pima Indians of Arizona--1/4.]    Two strongly marked, fret-like meanders encircle the vessel, the  elements of which are ruled exclusively by the warp and woof, by the  radiate and the concentric lines of construction. This is the work of  the Pima Indians of Arizona.    [Illustration: FIG. 324. Coiled basket with geometric ornament  composed of triangular figures. Obtained from the McCloud River  Indians, California--1/8.]    I shall close the series with a very handsome example of Indian  basketry and of basketry ornamentation (Fig. 324). The conical shape  is highly pleasing and the design is thoroughly satisfactory and, like  all the others, is applied in a way indicative of a refined sense of  the decorative requirements of the utensil. The design is wholly  geometric, and, although varied in appearance, is composed almost  exclusively of dark triangular figures upon a light ground. The  general grouping is in three horizontal or encircling bands agreeing  with or following the foundation coil. Details are governed by the  horizontal and the oblique structure lines. The vertical construction  lines have no direct part in the conformation of the design excepting  in so far as they impose a stepped character upon all oblique  outlines.    These studies could be carried through all the types of primitive  textile combination, but such a work seems unnecessary, for in all  cases the elaboration in design, relieved and colored, is along  similar lines, is governed by the same class of forces, and reaches  closely corresponding results.           *       *       *       *       *    We have observed throughout the series of examples presented a decided  tendency toward banded or zonal arrangement of the ornamentation. Now  each of these bands is made up of a number of units, uniform in shape  and in size and joined or linked together in various suitable and  consistent ways. In contemplating them we are led to inquire into the  nature of the forces concerned in the accomplishment of such results.  The question arises as to exactly how much of the segregating and  aggregating forces or tendencies belongs to the technique of the art  and how much to the direct esthetic supervision of the human agent,  questions as to ideographic influence being for the present omitted.  This is a difficult problem to deal with, and I shall not attempt more  here than to point out the apparent teachings of the examples studied.    The desires of the mind constitute the motive power, the force that  gives rise to all progress in art; the appreciation of beauty and the  desire to increase it are the cause of all progress in purely  decorative elaboration. It appears, however, that there is in the mind  no preconceived idea of what that elaboration should be. The mind is a  growing thing and is led forward along the pathways laid out by  environment. Seeking in art gratification of an esthetic kind it  follows the lead of technique along the channels opened by such of the  useful arts as offer suggestions of embellishment. The results reached  vary with the arts and are important in proportion to the facilities  furnished by the arts. As I have already amply shown, the textile art  possesses vast advantages over all other arts in this respect, as it  is first in the field, of widest application, full of suggestions of  embellishment, and inexorably fixed in its methods of expression.

Water is generally taken as the unit in specific gravities  assigned to liquids and solids. This simply means that when we desire to  express how heavy a thing is, we are compelled to say it is so many  times heavier or lighter than something. That something is generally  water, which is regarded, consequently, as unit or figure 1. A body of  specific gravity 1.5, or 1-1/2, means that that body is 1-1/2 or 1.5  times as heavy as water. As hat manufacturers, you will have mostly to  do with the specific gravities of liquids, aqueous solutions, and you  will hear more of Twaddell degrees. The Twaddell hydrometer, or  instrument for measuring the specific gravities of liquids, is so  constructed that when it stands in water, the water is just level with  its zero or 0 deg. mark. Well, since in your reading of methods and new  processes, you will often meet with specific gravity numbers and desire  to convert these into Twaddell degrees, I will give you a simple means  of doing this. Add cyphers so as to make into a number of four figures,  then strike out the unit and decimal point farthest to the left, and  divide the residue by 5, and you get the corresponding Twaddell degrees.  If you have Twaddell degrees, simply multiply by 5, and add 1000 to the  result, and you get the specific gravity as usually taken, with water as  the unit, or in this case as 1000. An instrument much used on the  Continent is the Beaume hydrometer. The degrees (_n_) indicated by this  instrument can be converted into specific gravity (_d_) by the        formula: _d_ = 144.3/(144.3 - n)    _Ebullition or Boiling of Water, Steam._--The atmosphere around us is  composed of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases; not a compound of  these gases, as water is of hydrogen and oxygen, but a mixture more like  sand and water or smoke and air. This mass of gases has weight, and  presses upon objects at the surface of the earth to the extent of 15 lb.  on the square inch. Now some liquids, such as water, were it not for  this atmospheric pressure, would not remain liquids at all, but would  become gases. The pressure thus tends to squeeze gases together and  convert them into liquids. Any force that causes gases to contract will  do the same thing, of course--for example, cold; and _ceteris paribus_  removal of pressure and expansion by heat will act so as to gasify  liquids. When in the expansion of liquids a certain stage or degree is  reached, different for different liquids, gas begins to escape so  quickly from the liquid that bubbles of vapour are continually formed  and escape. This is called ebullition or boiling. A certain removal of  pressure, or expansion by heat, is necessary to produce this, _i.e._ to  reach the boiling-point of the liquid. As regards the heat necessary for  the boiling of water at the surface of the earth, _i.e._ under the  atmospheric pressure of 15 lb. on the square inch, this is shown on the  thermometer of Fahrenheit as 212 deg., and on the simpler centigrade one, as  100 deg., water freezing at 0 deg. C. But if what I have said is true, when we  remove some of the atmospheric pressure, the water should boil with a  less heat than will cause the mercury in the thermometer to rise to 100 deg.  C., and if we take off all the pressure, the water ought to boil and  freeze at the same time. This actually happens in the Carre ice-making  machine. The question now arises, \"Why does the water freeze in the  Carre machine?\" All substances require certain amounts of heat to enable  them to take and to maintain the liquid state if they are ordinarily  solid, and the gaseous state if ordinarily liquid or solid, and the  greater the change of state the greater the heat needed. Moreover, this  heat does not make them warm, it is simply absorbed or swallowed up, and  becomes latent, and is merely necessary to maintain the new condition  assumed. In the case of the Carre machine, liquid water is, by removal  of the atmospheric pressure, coerced, as it were, to take the gaseous  form. But to do so it needs to absorb the requisite amount of heat to  aid it in taking that form, and this heat it must take up from all  surrounding warm objects. It absorbs quickly all it can get out of  itself as liquid water, out of the glass vessel containing it, and from  the surrounding air. But the process of gasification with ebullition  goes on so quickly that the temperature of the water thus robbed of heat  quickly falls to 0 deg. C., and the remaining water freezes. Thus, then, by  pumping out the air from a vessel, _i.e._ working in a vacuum, we can  boil a liquid in such exhausted vessel far below its ordinary boiling  temperature in the open air. This fact is of the utmost industrial  importance. But touching this question of latent heat, you may ask me  for my proof that there is latent heat, and a large amount of it, in a  substance that feels perfectly cold. I have told you that a gasified  liquid, or a liquefied solid, or most of all a gasified solid, contains  such heat, and if reconverted into liquid and solid forms respectively,  that heat is evolved, or becomes sensible heat, and then it can be  decidedly felt and indicated by the thermometer. Take the case of a  liquid suddenly solidifying. The heat latent in that liquid, and  necessary to keep it a liquid, is no longer necessary and comes out, and  the substance appears to become hot. Quicklime is a cold, white, solid  substance, but there is a compound of water and lime--slaked lime--which  is also a solid powdery substance, called by the chemist, hydrate of  lime. The water used to slake the quicklime is a liquid, and it may be  ice-cold water, but to form hydrate of lime it must assume a solid form,  and hence can and does dispense with its heat of liquefaction in the  change of state. You all know how hot lime becomes on slaking with  water. Of course we have heat of chemical combination here as well as  evolution of latent heat. As another example, we may take a solution of  acetate of soda, so strong that it is just on the point of  crystallising. If it crystallises it solidifies, and the liquid  consequently gives up its latent heat of liquefaction. We will make it  crystallise, first connecting the tube containing it to another one  containing a coloured liquid and closed by a cork carrying a narrow tube  dipping into the coloured liquid. On crystallising, the solution gives  off heat, as is shown by the expansion of the air in the corked tube,  and the consequent forcing of the coloured liquid up the narrow tube.  Consequently in your works you never dissolve a salt or crystal in water  or other liquid without rendering heat latent, or consuming heat; you  never allow steam to condense in the steam pipes about the premises  without losing vastly more heat than possibly many are aware of. Let us  inquire as to the latent heat of water and of steam.    _Latent Heats of Water and Steam._--If we mix 1 kilogram (about 2 lb.)  of ice (of course at zero or 0 deg. C.) with 1 kilogram of water at 79 deg. C.,  and stir well till the ice is melted, _i.e._ has changed its state from  solid to liquid, we find, on putting a thermometer in, the temperature  is only 0 deg. C. This simply means that 79 deg. of heat (centigrade degrees)  have become latent, and represent the heat of liquefaction of 1 kilogram  of ice. Had we mixed 1 kilogram of water at 0 deg. C. with 1 kilogram of  water at 79 deg. C. there would have been no change of state, and the  temperature of the mixture might be represented as a distribution of the  79 deg. C. through the whole mass of the 2 kilograms, and so would be  39-1/2 deg. C. We say, therefore, the latent heat of water is the heat which  is absorbed or rendered latent when a unit of weight, say 1 kilogram of  water as ice, melts and liquefies to a unit of water at zero, or it is  79 heat units. These 79 units of heat would raise 79 units of weight of  liquid water through 1 deg. C., or one unit of liquid water through 79 deg..    Let us now inquire what the latent heat of steam is. If we take 1  kilogram of water at 0 deg. C. and blow steam from boiling water at 100 deg. C.  into it until the water just boils, and then stop and weigh the  resulting water, we shall find it amounts to 1.187 kilograms, so that  0.187 kilogram of water which was in the gaseous steam form, and had  besides a sensible heat of 100 deg. C., has changed its state to that of  liquid water. This liquid water, being at the boiling-point, has still  the 100 deg. C. of sensible heat, and hence the water in the gaseous steam  form can have given up to the water at 0 deg. C. into which it was blown,  only the latent heat of gasification which was not sensible, but by  virtue of which it was enabled to assume the gaseous form. But if 0.187  kilogram of steam at 100 deg. C. can heat 1 kilogram of water through 100  degrees, then 1 kilogram of steam can raise 5.36 kilograms of ice-cold  water through 100 degrees, or 536 kilograms through 1 degree, and thus  the latent heat of steam is 536 heat units.    _Effect of Increase of Pressure on the Boiling of Water._--Now we have  referred to diminution of pressure and its effect on the boiling-point  of water, and I may point out that by increasing the pressure, such,  _e.g._, as boiling water under a high pressure of steam, you raise the  boiling-point. There are some industrial operations in which the action  of certain boiling solutions is unavailing to effect certain  decompositions or other ends when the boiling is carried on under the  ordinary atmospheric pressure, and boiling in closed and strong vessels  under pressure must be resorted to. Take as an example the wood-pulp  process for making paper from wood shavings. Boiling in open pans with  caustic soda lye is insufficient to reduce the wood to pulp, and so"]]]
