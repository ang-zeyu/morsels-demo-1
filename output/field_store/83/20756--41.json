The  problem, then, resolves itself into ways of making the desirable  emotion the stronger, of learning how to form the habit of giving it  the head start and the right of way. In our chapter on \"Choosing the  Emotions,\" we shall find that much depends on building up the right  kind of sentiments, or the permanent organization of instincts around  ideas. However, we must first look more closely at the separate  instincts to acquaint ourselves with the purpose and the ways of each,  and to discover the nature of the forces with which we have to deal.    [Footnote 7: Sherrington: _Integrative Action of the Nervous System_.]      I THE SELF-PRESERVATIVE INSTINCTS    =Hunger.= Hunger is the most pressing desire of the egoistic or  self-preserving impulse. The yearning for food and the impulse to seek  and eat it are aroused organically within the body and are behind much  of the activity of every type of life. As the impulse is so familiar,  and its promptings are so little subject to psychic control, it seems  unnecessary to do more than mention its importance.    =Flight and Fear.= All through the ages the race has been subject to  injury. Species has been pitted against species, individual against  individual. He who could fight hardest or run fastest has survived and  passed his abilities on to his offspring. Not all could be strongest  for fight, and many species have owed their existence to their ability  to run and to know when to run. Thus it is that one of the strongest  and most universal tendencies is the instinct for flight, and its  emotion, fear. \"Fear is the representation of injury and is born of  the innumerable injuries which have been inflicted in the course of  evolution.\"[8] Some babies are frightened if they are held too  loosely, even though they have never known a fall. Some persons have  an instinctive fear of cats, a left-over from the time when the race  needed to flee from the tiger and others of the cat family. Almost  every one, no matter in what state of culture, fears the unknown  because the race before him has had to be afraid of that which was not  familiar.    [Footnote 8: Crile: _Origin and Nature of the Emotions_.]    The emotion of fear is well known, but its purpose is not so often  recognized. An emotion brings about internal changes, visceral changes  they are called, which enable the organism to act on the emotion,--to  accomplish its object. There is only so much energy available at a  given moment, stored up in the brain cells, ready for use. In such an  emergency as flight every ounce of energy is needed. The large muscles  used in running must have a great supply of extra energy. The heart  and lungs must be speeded up in order to provide oxygen and take care  of extra waste products. The special senses of sight and hearing must  be sensitized. Digestion and intestinal peristalsis must be stopped in  order to save energy. No person could by conscious thought accomplish  all these things. How, then, are they brought about?    =Internal Laboratories.= In the wonderful internal laboratory of the  body there are little glands whose business it is to secrete chemicals  for just these emergencies. When an object is sighted which arouses  fear, the brain cells flash instantaneous messages over the body,  among others to the supra-renal glands or adrenals, just over the  kidneys, and to the thyroid gland in the neck. Instantly these glands  pour forth adrenalin and thyroid secretion into the blood, and the  body responds. Blood pressure rises; brain cells speed up; the liver  pours forth glycogen, its ready-to-burn fuel; sweat-glands send forth  cold perspiration in order to regulate temperature; blood is pumped  out from stomach and intestines to the external muscles. As we have  seen, the body as a whole can respond to just one stimulus at a time.  The response to this stimulus has the right of way. The whole body is  integrated, set for this one thing. When fear holds the switchboard no  other messages are allowed on the line, and the creature is ready for  flight.    But after flight comes concealment with the opposite bodily need, the  need for absolute silence. This is why we sometimes get the opposite  result. The heart seems to stop beating, the breath ceases, the limbs  refuse to move, all because our ancestors needed to hide after they  had run, and because we are in a very real way a part of them.    =Old-Fashioned Fear.= There is one passage from Dr. Crile's book which  so admirably sums up these points that it seems worth while to insert  it at length.         We fear not in our hearts alone, not in our brains alone, not in       our viscera alone--fear influences every organ and tissue. Each       organ or tissue is stimulated or inhibited according to its use       or hindrance in the physical struggle for existence. By thus       concentrating all or most of the nerve force on the       nerve-muscular mechanism for defense, a greater physical power is       developed. Hence it is that under the stimulus of fear animals       are able to perform preternatural feats of strength. For the same       reason, the exhaustion following fear will be increased as the       powerful stimulus of fear drains the cup of nervous energy even       though no visible action may result.... Perhaps the most striking       difference between man and animals lies in the greater control       which man has gained over his primitive instinctive reactions. As       compared with the entire duration of organic evolution, man came       down from his arboreal abode and assumed his new role of       increased domination over the physical world but a moment ago.       And now, though sitting at his desk in command of the complicated       machinery of civilization, when he fears a business catastrophe       his fear is manifested in the terms of his ancestral physical       battle in the struggle for existence. He cannot fear       intellectually, he cannot fear dispassionately, he fears with all       his organs, and the same       organs are stimulated and inhibited as if, instead of its being a       battle of credit, or position, or of honor, it were a physical       battle with teeth and claws.... Nature has but one means of       response to fear, and whatever its cause the phenomena are always       the same--always physical.[9]    [Footnote 9: Crile: _Origin and Nature of the Emotions_, p. 60 ff.]           *       *       *       *       *    The moral is as plain as day: Learn to call up fear only when speedy  legs are needed, not a cool head or a comfortable digestion. Fear is a  costly proceeding, an emergency measure like a fire-alarm, to be used  only when the occasion is urgent enough to demand it. How often it is  misused and how large a part it plays in nervous symptoms, both mental  and physical, will appear more clearly in later chapters.    =Repulsion and Disgust.= Akin to the instinct of flight is that of  repulsion, which impels us, instead of fleeing, to thrust the object  away. It leads us to reject from the mouth noxious and disgusting  objects and to shrink from slimy, creepy creatures, and has of course  been highly useful in protecting the race from poisons and snakes. It  still operates in the tendency to put away from us those things,  mental or physical, toward which we feel aversion or disgust. Recent  psychological discoveries have revealed how largely a neurosis  consists in putting away from us--out of consciousness,--whatever we  do not wish to recognize, and so it happens that disgust plays an  unexpected part in nervous disorders.    =Curiosity and Wonder.= Fortunately for the race, it has not had to  wait until different features of the environment prove to be helpful  or harmful. There is an instinct which urges forward to exploration  and discovery and which enables the creature not only to adapt itself  to the environment but to learn how to adapt the environment to  itself. This is the instinct of curiosity. It is the impulse back of  all advance in science, religion, and intellectual achievement of  every kind, and is sometimes called \"intellectual feeling.\"    =Self-Assertion.= It goes almost without saying that one of the  strongest and most important impulses of mankind is the instinct of  self-assertion; it often gets us into trouble, but it is also behind  every effort toward developed character. At its lowest level  self-assertion manifests itself in the strutting of the peacock, the  prancing of the horse, and the \"See how big I am,\" of the small boy.  At its highest level, when combined with self-consciousness and the  moral sentiments acquired from society and developed into the  self-regarding sentiment, it is responsible for most of our ideas of  right, our conception of what is and what is not compatible with our  self-respect.    =Self-Abasement.= Self-assertion is aroused primarily by the presence  of others and especially of those to whom we feel in any way  superior, but when the presence of others makes us feel small, when we  want to hide or keep in the background, we are being moved by the  opposite instinct of self-abasement and negative self-feeling. It may  be either the real or the fancied superiority of the spectators that  arouses this feeling,--their wisdom or strength, beauty or good  clothes. Sometimes, as in stage-fright, it is their numerical  superiority. Bashfulness is the struggle between the two  self-instincts, assertion and abasement. Our impulse for self-display  urges us on to make a good impression, while our feeling of  inferiority impels us to get away unnoticed. Hence the struggle and  the painful emotion.    =Gregariousness.= Man has been called a gregarious animal. That is,  like the animals, he likes to run with his kind, and feels a  pronounced aversion to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#6)"],[1," capitally  convicted; nor have they any other reason to allege why the immortality  of the soul appears to them to be incredible, except that they are not  able to conceive what sort of thing the soul can be when disentangled  from the body; just as if they could really form a correct idea as to  what sort of thing it is, even when it is in the body; what its form,  and size, and abode are; so that were they able to have a full view of  all that is now hidden from them in a living body, they have no idea  whether the soul would be discernible by them, or whether it is of so  fine a texture that it would escape their sight. Let those consider  this, who say that they are unable to form any idea of the soul without  the body, and then they will see whether they can form any adequate  idea of what it is when it is in the body. For my own part, when I  reflect on the nature of the soul, it appears to me a far more  perplexing and obscure question to determine what is its character  while it is in the body--a place which, as it were, does not belong to  it--than to imagine what it is when it leaves it, and has arrived at  the free aether, which is, if I may so say, its proper, its own  habitation. For unless we are to say that we cannot apprehend the  character or nature of anything which we have never seen, we certainly  may be able to form some notion of God, and of the divine soul when  released from the body. Dicaearchus, indeed, and Aristoxenus, because it  was hard to understand the existence and substance and nature of the  soul, asserted that there was no such thing as a soul at all. It is,  indeed, the most difficult thing imaginable to discern the soul by the  soul. And this, doubtless, is the meaning of the precept of Apollo,  which advises every one to know himself. For I do not apprehend the  meaning of the God to have been that we should understand our members,  our stature, and form; for we are not merely bodies; nor, when I say  these things to you, am I addressing myself to your body: when,  therefore, he says, \"Know yourself,\" he says this, \"Inform yourself of  the nature of your soul;\" for the body is but a kind of vessel, or  receptacle of the soul, and whatever your soul does is your own act. To  know the soul, then, unless it had been divine, would not have been a  precept of such excellent wisdom as to be attributed to a God; but even  though the soul should not know of what nature itself is, will you say  that it does not even perceive that it exists at all, or that it has  motion? On which is founded that reason of Plato's, which is explained  by Socrates in the Phaedrus, and inserted by me, in my sixth book of the  Republic.    XXIII. \"That which is always moved is eternal; but that which gives  motion to something else, and is moved itself by some external cause,  when that motion ceases, must necessarily cease to exist. That,  therefore, alone, which is self-moved, because it is never forsaken by  itself, can never cease to be moved. Besides, it is the beginning and  principle of motion to everything else; but whatever is a principle has  no beginning, for all things arise from that principle, and it cannot  itself owe its rise to anything else; for then it would not be a  principle did it proceed from anything else. But if it has no  beginning, it never will have any end; for a principle which is once  extinguished cannot itself be restored by anything else, nor can it  produce anything else from itself; inasmuch as all things must  necessarily arise from some first cause. And thus it comes about that  the first principle of motion must arise from that thing which is  itself moved by itself; and that can neither have a beginning nor an  end of its existence, for otherwise the whole heaven and earth would be  overset, and all nature would stand still, and not be able to acquire  any force by the impulse of which it might be first set in motion.  Seeing, then, that it is clear that whatever moves itself is eternal,  can there be any doubt that the soul is so? For everything is inanimate  which is moved by an external force; but everything which is animate is  moved by an interior force, which also belongs to itself. For this is  the peculiar nature and power of the soul; and if the soul be the only  thing in the whole world which has the power of self-motion, then  certainly it never had a beginning, and therefore it is eternal.\"    Now, should all the lower order of philosophers (for so I think they  may be called who dissent from Plato and Socrates and that school)  unite their force, they never would be able to explain anything so  elegantly as this, nor even to understand how ingeniously this  conclusion is drawn. The soul, then, perceives itself to have motion,  and at the same time that it gets that perception, it is sensible that  it derives that motion from its own power, and not from the agency of  another; and it is impossible that it should ever forsake itself. And  these premises compel you to allow its eternity, unless you have  something to say against them.    _A._ I should myself be very well pleased not to have even a thought  arise in my mind against them, so much am I inclined to that opinion.    XXIV. _M._ Well, then, I appeal to you, if the arguments which prove  that there is something divine in the souls of men are not equally  strong? But if I could account for the origin of these divine  properties, then I might also be able to explain how they might cease  to exist; for I think I can account for the manner in which the blood,  and bile, and phlegm, and bones, and nerves, and veins, and all the  limbs, and the shape of the whole body, were put together and made; ay,  and even as to the soul itself, were there nothing more in it than a  principle of life, then the life of a man might be put upon the same  footing as that of a vine or any other tree, and accounted for as  caused by nature; for these things, as we say, live. Besides, if  desires and aversions were all that belonged to the soul, it would have  them only in common with the beasts; but it has, in the first place,  memory, and that, too, so infinite as to recollect an absolute  countless number of circumstances, which Plato will have to be a  recollection of a former life; for in that book which is inscribed  Menon, Socrates asks a child some questions in geometry, with reference  to measuring a square; his answers are such as a child would make, and  yet the questions are so easy, that while answering them, one by one,  he comes to the same point as if he had learned geometry. From whence  Socrates would infer that learning is nothing more than recollection;  and this topic he explains more accurately in the discourse which he  held the very day he died; for he there asserts that, any one, who  seeming to be entirely illiterate, is yet able to answer a question  well that is proposed to him, does in so doing manifestly show that he  is not learning it then, but recollecting it by his memory. Nor is it  to be accounted for in any other way, how children come to have notions  of so many and such important things as are implanted, and, as it were,  sealed up, in their minds (which the Greeks call [Greek: ennoiai]),  unless the soul, before it entered the body, had been well stored with  knowledge. And as it had no existence at all (for this is the  invariable doctrine of Plato, who will not admit anything to have a  real existence which has a beginning and an end, and who thinks that  that alone does really exist which is of such a character as what he  calls [Greek: eidea], and we species), therefore, being shut up in the  body, it could not while in the body discover what it knows; but it  knew it before, and brought the knowledge with it, so that we are no  longer surprised at its extensive and multifarious knowledge. Nor does  the soul clearly discover its ideas at its first resort to this abode  to which it is so unaccustomed, and which is in so disturbed a state;  but after having refreshed and recollected itself, it then by its  memory recovers them; and, therefore, to learn implies nothing more  than to recollect. But I am in a particular manner surprised at memory.  For what is that faculty by which we remember? what is its force? what  its nature? I am not inquiring how great a memory Simonides[13] may be  said to have had, or Theodectes,[14] or that Cineas[15] who was sent to  Rome as ambassador from Pyrrhus; or, in more modern times,  Charmadas;[16] or, very lately, Metrodorus[17] the Scepsian, or our own  contemporary Hortensius[18]: I am speaking of ordinary memory, and  especially of those men who are employed in any important study or art,  the great capacity of whose minds it is hard to estimate, such numbers  of things do they remember.    XXV. Should you ask what this leads to, I think we may understand what  that power is, and whence we have it. It certainly proceeds neither  from the heart, nor from the blood, nor from the brain, nor from atoms;  whether it be air or fire, I know not, nor am I, as those men are,  ashamed, in cases where I am ignorant, to own that I am so. If in any  other obscure matter I were able to assert anything positively, then I  would swear that the soul, be it air or fire, is divine. Just think, I  beseech you: can you imagine this wonderful power of memory to be sown  in or to be a part of the composition of the earth, or of this dark and  gloomy atmosphere? Though you cannot apprehend what it is, yet you see  what kind of thing it is, or if you do not quite see that, yet you  certainly see how great it is. What, then? Shall we imagine that there  is a kind of measure in the soul, into which, as into a vessel, all  that we remember is poured? That indeed is absurd; for how shall we  form any idea of the bottom, or of the shape or fashion of such a soul  as that? And, again, how are we to conceive how much it is able to  contain? Shall we imagine the soul"]]]
