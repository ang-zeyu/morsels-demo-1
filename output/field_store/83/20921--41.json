[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18113"],[0,"History of the Expedition to Russia (#6)"],[1," of the great  emperor to put all the governments and all the religions of Europe in  motion for the accomplishment of his great designs: their triumph would  have been then secured; and if the voice of another Homer had been  wanting to this king of so many kings, the voice of the nineteenth  century, the great century, would have supplied it; and the cry of  astonishment of a whole age, penetrating and piercing through futurity,  would have echoed from generation to generation, to the latest  posterity!    So much glory was not in reserve for us.    Which of us, in the French army, can ever forget his astonishment, in  the midst of the Russian plains, on hearing the news of the fatal  treaties of the Turks and Swedes with Alexander; and how anxiously our  looks were turned towards our right uncovered, towards our left  enfeebled, and upon our retreat menaced? _Then_ we only looked at the  fatal effects of the peace between our allies and our enemy; _now_ we  feel desirous of knowing the causes of it.    The treaties concluded about the end of the last century, had subjected  the weak sultan of the Turks to Russia; the Egyptian expedition had  armed him against us. But ever since Napoleon had assumed the reins of  power, a well-understood common interest, and the intimacy of a  mysterious correspondence, had reconciled Selim with the first consul: a  close connexion was established between these two princes, and they had  exchanged portraits with each other. Selim attempted to effect a great  revolution in the Turkish customs. Napoleon encouraged him, and was  assisting him in introducing the European discipline into the Ottoman  army, when the victory of Jena, the war of Poland, and the influence of  Sebastiani, determined the sultan to throw off the yoke of Alexander.  The English made hasty attempts to oppose this, but they were driven  from the sea of Constantinople. Then it was that Napoleon wrote the  following letter to Selim.    \"_Osterode, April_ 3, 1807.    \"My ambassador informs me of the bravery and good conduct of the  Mussulmans against our common enemies. Thou hast shown thyself the  worthy descendant of the Selims and the Solimans. Thou hast asked me for  some officers; I send them to thee. I regretted that thou hadst not  required of me some thousand men,--thou hast only asked for five  hundred; I have given orders for their immediate departure. It is my  intention that they shall be paid and clothed at my expense, and that  thou shalt be reimbursed the expenses which they may occasion thee. I  have given orders to the commander of my troops in Dalmatia to send thee  the arms, ammunition, and every thing thou shalt require of me. I have  given the same orders at Naples; and artillery has been already placed  at the disposal of the pasha of Janina. Generals, officers, arms of  every description, even money--I place all at thy disposal. Thou hast  only to ask: do so in a distinct manner, and all which thou shalt  require I will send thee on the instant. Arrange matters with the shah  of Persia, who is also the enemy of the Russians; encourage him to stand  fast, and to attack warmly the common enemy. I have beaten the Russians  in a great battle; I have taken from them seventy-five pieces of cannon,  sixteen standards, and a great number of prisoners. I am at the distance  of eighty leagues beyond Warsaw, and am about to take advantage of the  fifteen days' repose which I have given to my army, to repair thither,  and there to receive thy ambassador. I am sensible of the want thou hast  of artillerymen and troops; I have offered both to thy ambassador; but  he has declined them, from a fear of alarming the delicacy of the  Mussulmans. Confide to me all thy wants; I am sufficiently powerful, and  sufficiently interested in thy prosperity, both from friendship and  policy, to have nothing to refuse thee. Peace has been proposed to me  here. I have been offered all the advantages which I could desire; but  they wished that I should ratify the state of things established  between the Porte and Russia by the treaty of Sistowa, and I refused. My  answer was, _that it was necessary that the Porte should be secured in  complete independence; and that all the treaties extorted from her,  during the time that France was asleep, should be revoked_.\"    This letter of Napoleon had been preceded and followed by verbal but  formal assurances, that he would not sheath the sword, until the Crimea  was restored to the dominion of the crescent. He had even authorized  Sebastiani to give the divan a copy of his instructions, which contained  these promises.    Such were his words, with which his actions at first corresponded.  Sebastiani demanded a passage through Turkey for an army of 25,000  French, which he was to command, and which was to join the Ottoman army.  An unforeseen circumstance, it is true, deranged this plan; but Napoleon  then made Selim the promise of an auxiliary force of 9000 French,  including 5000 artillerymen, who were to be conveyed in eleven vessels  of the line to Constantinople. The Turkish ambassador was at the same  time treated with the greatest distinction in the French camp; he  accompanied Napoleon in all his reviews: the most flattering attentions  were paid to him, and the grand-equerry (Caulaincourt,) was already  treating with him for an alliance, offensive and defensive, when a  sudden attack by the Russians interrupted the negotiation.    The ambassador returned to Warsaw, where the same respect continued to  be shown him, up to the day of the decisive victory of Friedland. But  on the following day his illusion was dissipated; he saw himself  neglected; for it was no longer Selim whom he represented. A revolution  had just hurled from the throne the monarch who had been the friend of  Napoleon, and with him all hope of giving the Turks a regular army, upon  which he could depend. Napoleon, therefore, judging that he could no  longer reckon upon the assistance of these barbarians, changed his  system. Henceforward it was Alexander whom he wished to gain; and as his  was a genius which never hesitated, he was already prepared to abandon  the empire of the East to that monarch, in order that he might be left  at liberty to possess himself of that of the West.    As his great object was the extension of the continental system, and to  make it surround Europe, the co-operation of Russia would complete its  development. Alexander would shut out the English from the North, and  compel Sweden to go to war with them; the French would expel them from  the centre, from the south, and from the west of Europe. Napoleon was  already meditating the expedition to Portugal, if that kingdom would not  join his coalition. With these ideas floating in his brain, Turkey was  now only an accessary in his plans, and he agreed to the armistice, and  to the conferences at Tilsit.    But a deputation had just come from Wilna, soliciting the restoration of  their national independence, and professing the same devotion to his  cause as had been shown by Warsaw; Berthier, whose ambition was  satisfied, and who began to be tired of war, dismissed these envoys  rudely, styling them traitors to their sovereign. The Prince of Eckmuehl,  on the contrary, favoured their object, and presented them to Napoleon,  who was irritated with Berthier for his treatment of these Lithuanians,  and received them graciously, without, however, promising them his  support. In vain did Davoust represent to him that the opportunity was  favourable, owing to the destruction of the Russian army; Napoleon's  reply was, \"that Sweden had just declared her armistice to him; that  Austria offered her mediation between France and Russia, which he looked  upon as a hostile step; that the Prussians, seeing him at such a  distance from France, might recover from their intimidation; and  finally, that Selim, his faithful ally, had just been dethroned, and his  place filled by Mustapha IV., of whose dispositions he knew nothing.\"    The emperor of France continued, therefore, to negotiate with Russia;  and the Turkish ambassador, neglected and forgotten, wandered about our  camp, without being summoned to take any part in the negotiations which  terminated the war; he returned to Constantinople soon after, in great  displeasure. Neither the Crimea, nor even Moldavia and Wallachia, were  restored to that barbarous court by the treaty of Tilsit; the  restitution of the two latter provinces was only stipulated by an  armistice, the conditions of which were never meant to be executed. But  as Napoleon professed to be the mediator between Mustapha and Alexander,  the ministers of the two powers repaired to Paris. But there, during  the long continuance of that feigned mediation, the Turkish  plenipotentiaries were never admitted to his presence.    If we must even tell the whole truth, it is asserted, that at the  interview at Tilsit, and subsequently, a treaty for the partition of  Turkey was under discussion. It was proposed to Russia to take  possession of Wallachia, Moldavia, Bulgaria, and a part of Mount Hemus.  Austria was to have Servia and a part of Bosnia; France the other part  of that province, Albania, Macedonia, and all Greece as far as  Thessalonica: Constantinople, Adrianople, and Thrace, were to be left to  the Turks.    Whether the conferences respecting this partition were really of a  serious nature, or merely the communication of a great idea, is  uncertain; so much is certain, that shortly after the interview at  Tilsit, Alexander's ambition was very sensibly moderated. The  suggestions of prudence had shown him the danger of substituting for the  ignorant, infatuated, and feeble Turkey, an active, powerful, and  unaccommodating neighbour. In his conversations on the subject at that  time, he remarked, \"that he had already too much desert country; that he  knew too well, by the occupation of the Crimea, which was still"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#6)"],[1,"later, explored the coast  north of Virginia, and gave it the name of New England, but he never  went back to Jamestown again. He died in London, and was buried in  a famous old church in that city.[8]    [Footnote 8: The church of St. Sepulchre: it is not very far from  St. Paul's Cathedral.]      47. What Captain Smith did for Virginia.--Captain John Smith was in  Virginia less than three years, yet in that short time he did a great  deal. First, he saved the settlers from starving, by making the  Indians sell them corn. Next, by his courage, he saved them from the  attacks of the savages. Lastly, he taught them how to work. Had it  not been for him the people of Jamestown would probably have lost  all heart and gone back to England. He insisted on their staying,  and so, through him, the English got their first real foothold in  America. But this was not all; he wrote two books on Virginia,  describing the soil, the trees, the animals, and the Indians. He also  made some excellent maps of Virginia and of New England. These books  and maps taught the English people many things about this country,  and helped those who wished to emigrate. For these reasons Captain  Smith has rightfully been called the \"Father of Virginia.\"    [Illustration: A SETTLER'S LOG CABIN.]      48. Negro slaves sent to Virginia; tobacco.--About ten years after  Captain Smith left Jamestown, the commander of a Dutch ship brought  a number of negro slaves to Virginia (1619), and sold them to the  settlers. That was the beginning of slavery in this country. Later,  when other English settlements had been made, they bought slaves,  and so, after a time, every settlement north as well as south owned  more or less negroes. The people of Virginia employed most of their  slaves in raising tobacco. They sold this in England, and, as it  generally brought a good price, many of the planters[9] became quite  rich.    [Footnote 9: Planter: a person who owns a plantation or large farm  at the South; it is cultivated by laborers living on it; once these  laborers were generally negro slaves.]      49. Bacon's war against Governor Berkeley;[10] Jamestown  burned.--Long after Captain Smith was in his grave, Sir William  Berkeley was made governor of Virginia by the king of England. He  treated the people very badly. At last a young planter named Bacon  raised a small army and marched against the governor, who was in  Jamestown. The governor, finding that he had few friends to fight  for him, made haste to get out of the place. Bacon then entered it  with his men; but as he knew that, if necessary, the king would send  soldiers from England to aid the governor in getting it back, he set  fire to the place and burned it. It was never built up again, and  so only a crumbling church-tower and a few gravestones can now be  seen where Jamestown once stood. Those ruins mark the first English  town settled in America.    [Illustration: THE BURNING OF JAMESTOWN.]    [Footnote 10: Berkeley (Berk'li).]      50. What happened later in Virginia; the Revolution; Washington;  four presidents.--But though Jamestown was destroyed, Virginia kept  growing in strength and wealth. What was better still, the country  grew in the number of its great men. The king of England continued  to rule America until, in 1776, the people of Virginia demanded that  independence should be declared. The great war of the Revolution  overthrew the king's power and made us free. The military leader of  that war was a Virginia planter named George Washington.    After we had gained the victory and peace was made, we chose  presidents to govern the country. Four out of six of our first  presidents, beginning with Washington, came from Virginia. For this  reason that state has sometimes been called the \"Mother of  Presidents.\"      51. Summary.--In 1607 Captain John Smith, with others, made the first  lasting settlement built up by Englishmen in America. Through  Captain Smith's energy and courage, Jamestown, Virginia, took firm  root. Virginia was the first state to demand the independence of  America, and Washington, who was a Virginian, led the war of the  Revolution by which that independence was gained.

CAPTAIN HENRY HUDSON  (Voyages from 1607 to 1611).      52. Captain Hudson tries to find a northwest passage to China and  the Indies.--When Captain John Smith sailed for Virginia, he left  a friend, named Henry Hudson, in London, who had the name of being  one of the best sea-captains in England.    While Smith was in Jamestown, a company of London merchants sent out  Captain Hudson to try to discover a passage to China and the Indies.  When he left England, he sailed to the northwest, hoping that he could  find a way open to the Pacific across the North Pole or not far below  it.    If he found such a passage, he knew that it would be much shorter  than a voyage round the globe further south; because, as any one can  see, it is not nearly so far round the top of an apple, near the stem,  as it is round the middle.    [Illustration: Map showing how Captain Hudson hoped to reach Asia  by sailing northwest from England.]    Hudson could not find the passage he was looking for; but he saw  mountains of ice, and he went nearer to the North Pole than any one  had ever done before.      53. The Dutch hire Captain Hudson; he sails for America.--The Dutch  people in Holland had heard of Hudson's voyage, and a company of  merchants of that country hired the brave sailor to see if he could  find a passage to Asia by sailing to the northeast.    He set out from the port of Amsterdam,[1] in 1609, in a vessel named  the _Half Moon_. After he had gone quite a long distance, the sailors  got so tired of seeing nothing but fog and ice that they refused to  go any further.    Then Captain Hudson turned his ship about and sailed for the coast  of North America. He did that because his friend, Captain Smith of  Virginia, had sent him a letter, with a map, which made him think  that he could find such a passage as he wanted north of Chesapeake  Bay.    [Footnote 1: See map in paragraph 62.]      54. Captain Hudson reaches America and finds the \"Great  River.\"--Hudson got to Chesapeake Bay, but the weather was so stormy  that he thought it would not be safe to enter it. He therefore sailed  northward along the coast. In September, 1609, he entered a beautiful  bay, formed by the spreading out of a noble river. At that point the  stream is more than a mile wide, and he called it the \"Great River.\"  On the eastern side of it, not far from its mouth, there is a long  narrow island: the Indians of that day called it Manhattan Island.      55. The tides in the \"Great River\"; Captain Hudson begins to sail  up the stream.--One of the remarkable things about the river which  Hudson had discovered is that it has hardly any current, and the tide  from the ocean moves up for more than a hundred and fifty miles. If  no fresh water ran in from the hills, still the sea would fill the  channel for a long distance, and so make a kind of salt-water river  of it. Hudson noticed how salt it was, and that, perhaps, made him  think that he had at last actually found a passage which would lead  him through from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He was delighted with  all he saw, and said, \"This is as beautiful a land as one can tread  upon.\" Soon he began to sail up the stream, wondering what he should  see and whether he should come out on an ocean which would take him  to Asia.    [Illustration: Map showing the Great River.]      56. Hudson's voyage on the \"Great River\"; his feast with the  Indians.--At first he drifted along, carried by the tide, under the  shadow of a great natural wall of rock. That wall, which we now call  the Palisades,[2] is from four hundred to six hundred feet high; it  extends for nearly twenty miles along the western shore of the river.    [Illustration: THE PALISADES.]    Then, some distance further up, Captain Hudson came to a place where  the river breaks through great forest-covered hills, called the  Highlands. At the end of the fifth day he came to a point on the  eastern bank above the Highlands, where the city of Hudson now stands.  Here an old Indian chief invited him to go ashore. Hudson had found  the Indians, as he says, \"very loving,\" so he thought he would accept  the invitation. The savages made a great feast for the captain. They  gave him not only roast pigeons, but also a roast dog, which they  cooked specially for him: they wanted he should have the very best.    These Indians had never seen a white man before. They thought that  the English captain, in his bright scarlet coat trimmed with gold  lace, had come down from the sky"]]]
