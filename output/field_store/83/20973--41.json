THE RAVEN      THERE was once a Queen and she had a little daughter, who was as yet a  babe in arms; and once the child was so restless that the mother could  get no peace, do what she would; so she lost patience, and seeing a  flight of ravens passing over the castle, she opened the window and said  to her child,    \"Oh, that thou wert a raven and couldst fly away, that I might be at  peace.\"    No sooner had she uttered the words, than the child was indeed changed  into a raven, and fluttered from her arms out of the window. And she  flew into a dark wood and stayed there a long time, and her parents knew  nothing of her. Once a man was passing through the wood, and he heard  the raven cry, and he followed the voice; and when he came near it said,    \"I was born a King's daughter, and have been bewitched, but thou canst  set me free.\"    \"What shall I do?\" asked the man.    \"Go deeper into the wood,\" said she, \"and thou shalt find a house and an  old woman sitting in it: she will offer thee meat and drink, but thou  must take none; if thou eatest or drinkest thou fallest into a deep  sleep, and canst not set me free at all. In the garden behind the house  is a big heap of tan, stand upon that and wait for me. Three days, at  about the middle of the day, shall I come to thee in a car drawn by four  white horses the first time, by four red ones the second time, and  lastly by four black ones; and if thou art not waking but sleeping, thou  failest to set me free.\"    The man promised to do all she said.    \"But ah!\" cried she, \"I know quite well I shall not be set free of thee;  something thou wilt surely take from the old woman.\"    But the man promised yet once more that certainly he would not touch the  meat or the drink. But when he came to the house the old woman came up  to him.    \"My poor man,\" said she to him, \"you are quite tired out, come and be  refreshed, and eat and drink.\"    \"No,\" said the man, \"I will eat and drink nothing.\"    But she left him no peace, saying,    \"Even if you eat nothing, take a draught out of this cup once and away.\"    So he was over-persuaded, and he drank.    In the afternoon, about two o'clock, he went out into the garden to  stand upon the tan-heap and wait for the raven. As he stood there he  felt all at once so tired, that he could bear it no longer, and laid  himself down for a little; but not to sleep. But no sooner was he  stretched at length than his eyes closed of themselves, and he fell  asleep, and slept so sound, as if nothing in the world could awaken him.    At two o'clock came the raven in the car drawn by four white horses, but  she was sad, knowing already that the man would be asleep, and so, when  she came into the garden, there he lay sure enough. And she got out of  the car and shook him and called to him, but he did not wake. The next  day at noon the old woman came and brought him meat and drink, but he  would take none. But she left him no peace, and persuaded him until he  took a draught out of the cup. About two o'clock he went into the garden  to stand upon the tan-heap, and to wait for the raven, but he was  overcome with so great a weariness that his limbs would no longer hold  him up; and whether he would or no he had to lie down, and he fell into  a deep sleep. And when the raven came up with her four red horses, she  was sad, knowing already that the man would be asleep. And she went up  to him, and there he lay, and nothing would wake him.    The next day the old woman came and asked what was the matter with him,  and if he wanted to die, that he would neither eat nor drink; but he  answered,    \"I neither can nor will eat and drink.\"    But she brought the dishes of food and the cup of wine, and placed them  before him, and when the smell came in his nostrils he could not  refrain, but took a deep draught. When the hour drew near, he went into  the garden and stood on the tan-heap to wait for the king's daughter; as  time went on he grew more and more weary, and at last he laid himself  down and slept like a stone. At two o'clock came the raven with four  black horses, and the car and all was black; and she was sad, knowing  already that he was sleeping, and would not be able to set her free; and  when she came up to him, there he lay and slept. She shook him and  called to him, but she could not wake him. Then she laid a loaf by his  side and some meat, and a flask of wine, for now, however much he ate  and drank, it could not matter. And she took a ring of gold from her  finger, and put it on his finger, and her name was engraven on it. And  lastly she laid by him a letter, in which was set down what she had  given him, and that all was of no use, and further also it said,    \"I see that here thou canst not save me, but if thy mind is to the  thing, come to the golden castle of Stromberg: I know well that if thou  willst thou canst.\" And when all this was done, she got again into her  car, and went to the golden castle of Stromberg.    When the man waked up and perceived that he had been to sleep, he was  sad at heart to think that she had been, and gone, and that he had not  set her free. Then, catching sight of what lay beside him, he read the  letter that told him all. And he rose up and set off at once to go to  the golden castle of Stromberg, though he knew not where it was. And  when he had wandered about in the world for a long time, he came to a  dark wood, and there spent a fortnight trying to find the way out, and  not being able. At the end of this time, it being towards evening, he  was so tired that he laid himself down under a clump of bushes and went  to sleep. The next day he went on again, and in the evening, when he was  going to lie down again to rest, he heard howlings and lamentations, so  that he could not sleep. And about the hour when lamps are lighted, he  looked up and saw a light glimmer in the forest; and he got up and  followed it, and he found that it came from a house that looked very  small indeed, because there stood a giant before it. And the man thought  to himself that if he were to try to enter and the giant were to see  him, it would go hard but he should lose his life. At last he made up  his mind, and walked in. And the giant saw him.    \"I am glad thou art come,\" said he; \"it is now a long time since I have  had anything to eat; I shall make a good supper of thee.\"    \"That may be,\" said the man, \"but I shall not relish it; besides, if  thou desirest to eat, I have somewhat here that may satisfy thee.\"    \"If that is true,\" answered the giant, \"thou mayest make thy mind easy;  it was only for want of something better that I wished to devour thee.\"    Then they went in and placed themselves at the table, and the man  brought out bread, meat, and wine in plenty.    \"This pleases me well,\" said the giant, and he ate to his heart's  content. After a while the man asked him if he could tell him where the  golden castle of Stromberg was.    \"I will look on my land-chart,\" said the giant, \"for on it all towns and  villages and houses are marked.\"    So he fetched the land-chart which was in his room, and sought for the  castle, but it was not to be found.    \"Never mind,\" said he, \"I have up-stairs in the cupboard much bigger  maps than this; we will have a look at them.\" And so they did, but in  vain.    And now the man wanted to pursue his journey, but the giant begged him  to stay a few days longer, until his brother, who had gone to get in a  store of provisions, should return. When the brother came, they asked  him about the golden castle of Stromberg.    \"When I have had time to eat a meal and be satisfied, I will look at the  map.\"    That being done, he went into his room with them, and they looked at his  maps, but could find nothing: then he fetched other old maps, and they  never left off searching until they found the golden castle of  Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.    \"How shall I ever get there?\" said the man.    \"I have a couple of hours to spare,\" said the giant, \"and I will set you  on your way, but I shall have to come back and look after the child that  we have in the house with us.\"    Then the giant bore the man until within about a hundred hours' journey  from the castle, and saying,    \"You can manage the rest of the way by yourself,\" he departed; and the  man went on day and night, until at last he came to the golden castle of  Stromberg. It stood on a mountain of glass, and he could see the  enchanted Princess driving round it, and then passing inside the gates.  He was rejoiced when he saw her, and began at once to climb the mountain  to get to her; but it was so slippery, as fast as he went he fell back  again. And when he saw this he felt he should never reach her, and he  was full of grief, and resolved at least to stay at the foot of the  mountain and wait for her. So he built himself a hut, and sat there and  waited a whole year; and every day he saw the Princess drive round and  pass in, and was never able to reach her.    One day he looked out of his hut and saw three robbers fighting, and he  called out, \"Mercy on us!\" Hearing a voice, they stopped for a moment,  but went on again beating one another in a dreadful manner. And he cried  out again, \"Mercy on us!\" They stopped and listened, and looked about  them, and then went on again. And he cried out a third time, \"Mercy on  us!\" and then, thinking he would go and see what was the matter, he went  out and asked them what they were fighting for. One of them told him he  had found "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#6)"],[1,"not too far  from the ship. At least this crowd did not appear to consider that the  Hunter was there to do all the serious moving and storing of supplies.  All three of the clients pitched in to help, and Wass' man went down  to the river to return with half a dozen silver-fins cleaned and  threaded on a reed, ready to broil over the cook unit.    A fire in the night was not needed except to afford the proper stage  setting. But it was enjoyed. Hume leaned forward to feed the flames,  and Starns pushed some lengths of driftwood closer.    \"You have said, Hunter, that hunting worlds never contain intelligent  native life. Unless the planet is minutely explored how can your  survey teams be sure of that fact?\" His voice bordered on the  pedantic, but his interest was plain.    \"By using the verifier.\" Hume sat crosslegged, his plasta-hand resting  on one knee. \"Fifty years ago, we would have had to keep rather a  lengthy watch to be sure of a free world. Now, we plant verifiers at  suitable test points. Intelligence means mental activity of some  sort--any of which would be recorded on the verifier.\"    \"Amazing!\" Starns extended his plump hands to the flames in the  immemorial gesture of a human attracted not only to the warmth of the  burning wood, but to its promise of security against the forces of the  dark. \"No matter how few, or how scattered your native thinkers may  be, you record them without missing any?\"    Hume shrugged. \"Maybe one or two,\" he grinned, \"might get through such  a screening. But we have yet to discover a planet with such a sparse  native life as that at the level of intelligence.\"    Yactisi juggled a cup in and out of the firelight. \"I agree, this is  most interesting.\" He was a thin man, with scanty drab gray hair and  dark skin, perhaps the result of the mingling of several human races.  His eyes were slightly sunken, so that it was difficult in this light  to read their expression. He was, Hume had already decided, a class  one brain and observant to a degree, which could either be a help or a  menace. \"There have been no cases of failure?\"    \"None reported,\" Hume returned. All his life he had relied on machines  operating, of course, under the competent domination of men trained to  use them properly. He understood the process of the verifier, had seen  it at work. At the Guild Headquarters there were no records of its  failure; he was willing to believe it was infallible.    \"A race residing in the sea now--could you be sure your machine would  discover its presence?\" Starns continued to question.    Hume laughed. \"Not to be found on Jumala, you may be sure of that--the  seas here are small and shallow. Such, not to be picked up by the  verifier, would have to exist at great depths and never venture on  land. So we need not fear any surprises here. The Guild takes no  chances.\"    \"As it always continues to assure one,\" Yactisi replied. \"The hour  grows late. I wish you rewarding dreams.\" He arose to go to his own  bubble tent.    \"Yes, indeed!\" Starns blinked at the fire and then scrambled up in  turn. \"We hunt along the river, then, tomorrow?\"    \"For water-cat,\" Hume agreed. Of the three, he believed Chambriss the  most impatient. Might as well let him pot his trophy as soon as  possible. The ex-pilot deduced there would be little cooperation in  exploration from that client until he was satisfied in his own quest.    Rovald, Wass' man, lingered by the fire until the three civs were safe  in their bubbles.    \"River range tomorrow?\" he asked.    \"Yes. We can't rush the deal.\"    \"Agreed.\" Rovald spoke with a curtness he did not use when the civs  were present. \"Only don't delay too long. Remember, our boy's roaming  around out there. He might just be picked off by something before  these stumble-footed civs catch up with him.\"    \"That's the chance we knew we'd have to take. We don't dare raise any  suspicion. Yactisi, for one, is no fool, neither is Starns. Chambriss  just wants to get his water-cat, but he could become nasty if anyone  tried to steer him.\"    \"Too long a wait might run us into trouble. Wass doesn't like  trouble.\"    Hume spun around. In the half light of the fire his features were set,  his mouth grim. \"Neither do I, Rovald, neither do I!\" he said softly,  but with an icy promise beneath the words.    Rovald was not to be intimidated. He grinned. \"Set your fins down,  fly-boy. You need Wass--and I'm here to hold his stakes for him. This  is a big deal, we won't want any misses!\"    \"There won't be any--not from my side.\" Hume stepped away from the  fire, approached a post which gleamed with a dull, red line of fire  down either side. He pressed a control button. That red line flared  into a streak of brilliance. Now encircling the bubble tents and the  space ship was a force field: routine protection of a safari camp on a  strange world and one Hume had set as a matter of course.    He stood for a long moment staring through that invisible barrier  toward the direction of the wood. It was a dark night, there were  scudding clouds to hide the stars, which meant rain probably before  morning. This was no time to be plagued by uncertain weather.    Somewhere out there Brodie was holed up. He hoped the boy had long ago  reached the \"camp\" so carefully erected and left for his occupancy.  The L-B, that stone covered \"grave\" showing signs of several years'  occupancy, was all assembled and constructed to the last small detail.  Far less might have deceived the civs in this safari. But as soon as  the story of their find leaked, there would be others on the scene,  men trained to assess the signs of a castaway's fight for survival.  His own Guild training and the ability of Wass' renegade techs should  bring them through that test.    What had Starns seen? The glint of sun on the tail of the L-B, tilted  now to the sky? Hume walked slowly back to the fire, when he saw  Rovald going up the ramp into the spacer. He smiled. Did Wass think he  was stupid enough not to guess that the Veep's man would be in com  touch with his employer? Rovald was about to report along some channel  of the shadow world that they had landed and that the play was about  to begin. Hume wondered idly how far and through how many relays that  message would pass before it reached its destination.    He stretched and yawned, moving to his sleeping pad. Tomorrow they  must find Chambriss a water-cat. Hume shoved Brodie into the back of  his mind to center his thoughts on the various ways of delivering, to  the waiting sportsman, a fair-sized alien feline.    The lights in the bubbles went out one by one. Within the circle  barrier of the force field men slept. And by midnight the rain began  to fall, streaming down the sides of the bubbles, soaking the ashes of  the fire.    Out of the dark crept that which was not thought, not substance, but  alien to the off-world men. But the barrier, meant to deter  multi-footed creatures, with wings or no visible limbs at all, proved  to be a better protection than its creators had hoped. There was no  penetration--only a baffled butting of one force against another. And  then the probe withdrew as undetected as it had come.    Only, the thing which had no intelligence, as humankind rated  intelligence, did possess the ability to fathom the nature of that  artificial barrier. The force field was examined, its nature digested.  First approach had failed. The second was now ready--ready as it had  not been months before when the first coming of these creatures had  alerted the very ancient watchdog on Jumala.    Deep in the darker woods on the mountain sides there was a stirring.  Things whimpered in their sleep, protested subconsciously commands  they could never understand, only obey. With the coming of dawn there  would be a marshaling of hosts, a new assault--not on the camp, but on  any leaving its protection. And also on the boy now sleeping in a  shallow cave formed by the swept roots of a tree--a tree which had  crashed when the L-B landed.    Again, fortune favored Hume. With the dawn the rain was over. There  was a cloudy sky overhead, but he believed the day would clear. The  roily, rushing water of the river would aid Chambriss' quest.  Water-cats holed up in the banks, but rising water often forced them  out of such dens. A course parallel to the stream bed could well show  them the tracks of one of the felines.    They started off in a group, Hume leading, with Chambriss treading  briskly behind him, Rovald bringing up the rear in the approved trail  technique. Chambriss carried a needler, Starns was unarmed except for  a small protection stunner, his tri-dee box slung on his chest by  well-worn carrying straps. Yactisi shouldered an electric pole, wore  its control belt buckled about his middle, though Hume had warned him  that the storm would prevent any deep hole fishing.    Only a short distance from the campsite they came upon the  unmistakable marks of a water-cat's broad paws, pressed in so heavy  and distinct a pattern that Hume knew the animal could not be far  ahead. The indentations were deep, and he measured the distance  between them with the length of his hand.    \"Big one!\" Chambriss exclaimed in satisfaction. \"Going away from the  river, too.\"    That point puzzled Hume slightly. The red coated felines might be  washed out of their burrows, but they did not willingly head so  sharply away from the water. He squatted on his heels and surveyed the  stretch of countryside between them and the distant wood with care.    The grass was this season's, still growing, not tall enough to afford  cover for an animal with paws as large as these prints. There were two  clumps of brush. It could have holed up in either, waiting to attack  any trailer--but why? It had not been wounded, nor frightened by their  party, there was no reason for it to set an ambush on its back trail.    Starns and Yactisi dropped back, though Starns was"]]]
