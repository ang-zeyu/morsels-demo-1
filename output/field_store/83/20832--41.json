If the  palankin-bearers were very good, they shuffled along at the rate of  about three miles an hour, and if there were no delays, forty or  forty-five miles could be accomplished before it became necessary to  seek shelter from the sun in one of the dak-bungalows, or rest-houses,  erected by Government at convenient intervals along all the principal  routes. In these bungalows a bath could be obtained, and sorely it was  needed after a journey of thirteen or fourteen hours at a level of  only a few inches above an exceedingly dusty road. As to food, the  _khansamah_, like 'mine host' in the old country, declared himself  at the outset prepared to provide everything the heart of man could  desire; when, however, the traveller was safely cornered for the rest  of the day, the _menu_ invariably dwindled down to the elementary  and universal 'sudden death,' which meant a wretchedly thin chicken,  caught, decapitated, grilled, and served up within twenty minutes of  the meal being ordered. At dinner a variety was made by the chicken  being curried, accompanied by an unlimited supply of rice and chutney.    I was glad to be able to break the monotony of this long journey by  a visit to a half-sister of mine, who was then living at the  hill-station of Mussoorie. The change to the delightful freshness of a  Himalayan climate after the Turkish-bath-like atmosphere of the plains  in September was most grateful, and I thoroughly enjoyed the few days  I spent in the midst of the lovely mountain scenery.    My next station was Umballa. There I fell in with two other troops of  Horse Artillery, and became more than ever enamoured with the idea of  belonging to so splendid a service. From Umballa it was a two nights'  journey to Ludhiana, where I rested for the day, and there met a  cousin in the Survey Department, who had been suddenly ordered to  Lahore, so we agreed to travel together.    The next halting-place was Jullundur. To make a change, we hired a  buggy at this place, in which to drive the first stage, sending our  palankins on ahead; when we overtook them, we found, to our surprise,  that their number had increased to six. We were preparing for a start,  when it struck us that we ought to make some inquiries about the  additional four, which, from the luggage lying about, we assumed to  be occupied, but which appeared to be stranded for want of bearers to  carry them on. The doors were carefully closed, and it was some time  before we could get an answer to our offers of assistance. Eventually  a lady looked out, and told us that she and a friend, each accompanied  by two children and an _ayah_,[1] were on their way to Lahore; that  the bearers who had brought them so far had run away, and that they  were absolutely in despair as to how they were to proceed. It turned  out that the bearers, who had been engaged to carry the ladies on  the second stage towards Lahore, found it more amusing to attend the  ceremony of the installation of the Raja of Kaparthala, then going on,  than to fulfil their engagement. After discussing the situation, the  ladies were persuaded to get out of their palankins and into our  buggy. We divided the baggage and six doolies between our sixteen  bearers, and started off, my cousin, the _ayahs_, and I on foot. It  was then 10 p.m. We hoped relays of bearers for the whole party  would be forthcoming at the next stage, but we were doomed to  disappointment. Our reliefs were present, but none for the ladies.  We succeeded, however, in inducing our original bearers to come on a  further stage, thus arranging for the carriage of the _ayahs_, while  we two men trudged on beside the buggy for another ten or twelve  miles. It was a heavy, sandy road, and three stages were about as much  as the horse could manage.    Soon after daybreak next morning we reached the Bias river. Crossing  by a bridge of boats, we found on the other side a small one-roomed  house with a verandah running round it, built for the use of the  European overseer in charge of the road. On matters being explained,  this man agreed to turn out. The ladies and children were put inside,  and my cousin and I spent the day in the verandah; in the evening,  with the assistance of the overseer, we were able to get a sufficient  number of bearers to carry us all on to Mian Mir without further  adventure. In the course of conversation we found that one of the  ladies was the wife of Lieutenant Donald Stewart,[2] of the 9th Bengal  Infantry, and that she and her friend were returning to join their  respective husbands after spending the summer months at Simla. This  meeting was the beginning of a close friendship with Sir Donald and  Lady Stewart, which has lasted to the present day.    At Mian Mir (the military cantonment of Lahore) I stayed a few days  with another half-sister, and from there, as the weather was beginning  to get cooler, I travelled day and night. One evening about eight  o'clock I was disappointed at not having come across the usual  rest-house; lights could be seen, however, at no great distance, and  I proceeded towards them; they turned out to be the camp fires of a  Cavalry regiment which was halting there for the night. Being half  famished, and fearing that my craving for food was not likely to be  gratified unless someone in the camp would take pity upon my forlorn  condition, I boldly presented myself at the first tent I came across.  The occupant came out, and, on hearing the strait I was in, he with  kindly courtesy invited me to enter the tent, saying, 'You are just  in time to share our dinner.' My host turned out to be Major Crawford  Chamberlain,[3] commanding the 1st Irregular Cavalry, the famous  Skinner's Horse, then on its way to Peshawar. A lady was sitting at  the table--Mrs. Chamberlain--to whom I was introduced; I spent a very  pleasant evening, and in this way commenced another equally agreeable  and lasting friendship.      [Footnote 1: A Native woman-servant.]    [Footnote 2: Now Field Marshal Sir Donald Stewart, Bart., G.C.B.,  G.C.S.I.]    [Footnote 3: Now General Crawford Chamberlain, C.S.I., a brother of  General Sir Neville Chamberlain.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III.  1852-1853      With my father at Peshawar--Peshawar in 1852--Excitements of a    frontier station--A flogging parade--Mackeson's assassination    --The Jowaki expedition--A strange dream--A typical frontier fight      Even the longest journey must come to an end at last, and early  in November I reached Peshawar. My father, who was then in his  sixty-ninth year, had just been appointed to command the division  with the temporary rank of Major-General. Old as this may appear at  a period when Colonels are superannuated at fifty-seven, and  Major-Generals must retire at sixty-two, my father did not consider  himself particularly unlucky. As for the authorities, they evidently  thought they were to be congratulated on having so young and active an  officer to place in a position of responsibility upon the North-West  Frontier, for amongst my father's papers I found letters from  the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General expressing high  satisfaction at his appointment to this difficult command.    It was a great advantage as well as a great pleasure to me to be with  my father at this time. I had left India an infant, and I had no  recollection of him until I was twelve years old, at which time he  came home on leave. Even then I saw very little of him, as I was at  school during the greater part of his sojourn in England, thus we met  at Peshawar almost as strangers. We did not, however, long remain so;  his affectionate greeting soon put an end to any feeling of shyness on  my part, and the genial and kindly spirit which enabled him to enter  into and sympathize with the feelings and aspirations of men younger  than himself, rendered the year I spent with him at Peshawar one  of the brightest and happiest of my early life. In one respect  particularly I benefited by the intercourse and confidence of the  year in question. My father spoke to me freely of his experiences in  Afghanistan, where he commanded during the Afghan war first a brigade,  and then Shah Shuja's contingent. The information I in this way  gathered regarding the characteristics of that peculiar country, and  the best means of dealing with its still more peculiar people, was  invaluable to me when I, in my turn, twenty-five years later, found  myself in command of an army in Afghanistan.    Eleven years only had elapsed since the first Afghan war, when my  father went to Peshawar and found himself again associated with  several Afghan friends; some had altogether settled in the Peshawar  district, for nearly all of those who had assisted us, or shown any  friendly feeling towards us, had been forced by Dost Mahomed Khan, on  his return as Amir to Kabul, to seek refuge in India. One of the chief  of these unfortunate refugees was Mahomed Usman Khan, Shah Shuja's  Wazir, or Prime Minister. He had been very intimate with my father, so  it was pleasant for them to meet again and talk over events in which  they had both played such prominent parts. Usman Khan died some years  ago; but visitors to India who travel as far as Peshawar may still  meet his sons, one of whom is the Commandant of the Khyber Rifles,  Lieutenant-Colonel Aslam Khan, C.I.E., a fine specimen of a Native  soldier and gentleman, who has proved his loyalty and done excellent  service to the State on many trying occasions.      [Illustration: GENERAL SIR ABRAHAM ROBERTS, G.C.B.    _From a photograph_.]      My father had also been on terms of intimacy with Dost Mahomed  himself and many other men of influence in Kabul, from whom, while at  Peshawar, he received most interesting letters, in which anxiety was  often expressed as to whether the English were amicably disposed  towards the Amir. To these communications my father was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1653"],[0,"The Imitation of Christ (#6)"],[1,"life, especially  those which concern the flesh.  But that we lack divine comforts  or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not  compunction of heart, nor utterly cast away those comforts which  are vain and worldly.    4. Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy  rather of much tribulation.  When a man hath perfect compunction,  then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him.  A good man  will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping; for whether  he considereth himself, or pondereth concerning his neighbour, he  knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation, and the more  thoroughly he considereth himself, the more thoroughly he grieveth.  Grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our  sins and vices, wherein we lie so entangled that we are but  seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.    5. If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy  life should be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to  improve.  And if thou didst seriously consider the future pains  of hell, I believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain  and fear not discipline.  But because these things reach not the  heart, and we still love pleasant things, therefore we remain  cold and miserably indifferent.    6. Oftentimes it is from poverty of spirit that the wretched body  is so easily led to complain.  Pray therefore humbly unto the  Lord that He will give thee the spirit of compunction and say in  the language of the prophet, Feed me, O Lord, with bread of  tears, and give me plenteousness of tears to drink.(1)    (1) Psalm lxxv. 5.      CHAPTER XXII    On the contemplation of human misery    Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou  turnest, unless thou turn thee to God.  Why art thou disquieted  because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and  desires?  Who is he that hath everything according to his will?  Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth.  There is no man  in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or  Pope.  Who is he who hath the happiest lot?  Even he who is  strong to suffer somewhat for God.    2. There are many foolish and unstable men who say, \"See what a  prosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how  powerful, how exalted.\"  But lift up thine eyes to the good  things of heaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly  things are nothing, they are utterly uncertain, yea, they are  wearisome, because they are never possessed without care and  fear.  The happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of  temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him.  Our life  upon the earth is verily wretchedness.  The more a man desireth  to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become to  him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of  human corruption.  For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to  rest, to labour, and to be subject to the other necessities of  nature, is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout  man, who would fain be released and free from all sin.    3. For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of  the body in this world.  Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth  to be freed from them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O  Lord.(1)  But woe to those who know not their own misery, and yet  greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible  life.  For to such a degree do some cling to it (even though by  labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for  subsistence) that if they might live here always, they would care  nothing for the Kingdom of God.    4. Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in  worldly things, that they relish nothing save the things of the  flesh!  Miserable ones!  they will too sadly find out at the  last, how vile and worthless was that which they loved.  The  saints of God and all loyal friends of Christ held as nothing the  things which pleased the flesh, or those which flourished in  this life, but their whole hope and affection aspired to the  things which are above.  Their whole desire was borne upwards to  everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be drawn  downwards by the love of things visible.    5. Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things  spiritual.  There is yet time, the hour is not past.  Why wilt  thou put off thy resolution?  Arise, begin this very moment, and  say, \"Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the  proper time for amendment.\"  When thou art ill at ease and  troubled, then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing.  Thou must go through fire and water that God may bring thee into  a wealthy place.  Unless thou put force upon thyself, thou wilt  not conquer thy faults.  So long as we carry about with us this  frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without  weariness and trouble.  Gladly would we have rest from all  misery; but because through sin we have lost innocence, we have  lost also the true happiness.  Therefore must we be patient, and  wait for the mercy of God, until this tyranny be overpast,  and this mortality be swallowed up of life.    6. O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to  evil!  To-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou  committest again the sins thou didst confess.  Now dost thou  resolve to avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest  thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all.  Good cause have  we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of  ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable.  And quickly  may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was  hardly attained through grace.    7. What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are  lukewarm and idle?  Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though  it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign  appeareth in our life of true holiness.  Rather had we need that  we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed  unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future  amendment and greater spiritual increase.    (1) Psalm xxv. 17.      CHAPTER XXIII    Of meditation upon death    Very quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed  therefore how it will be with thee in another world.  To-day man  is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more.  And being removed out  of sight, quickly also he is out of mind.  O the dulness and  hardness of man's heart, which thinketh only of the present, and  looketh not forward to the future.  Thou oughtest in every deed  and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day.  If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear  death.  It were better for thee to watch against sin, than to fly  from death.  If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be  ready to-morrow?  To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest  thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow?    2. What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little?  Ah!  long life doth not always amend, but often the more  increaseth guilt.  Oh that we might spend a single day in this  world as it ought to be spent!  Many there are who reckon the  years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is  the fruit thereof.  If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be  perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.  Happy is the  man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and  daily prepareth himself to die.  If thou hast ever seen one die,  consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.    3. When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see  the evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the  morrow.  Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may  never find thee unprepared.  Many die suddenly and unexpectedly.  For at such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.(1)  When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin to think very  differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn bitterly that  thou hast been so negligent and slothful.    4. Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he  would fain be found in death!  For a perfect contempt of the  world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of  discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey,  denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ;  these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy  death.  Whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of  good works; but when thou art in sickness I know not how much  thou wilt be able to do.  Few are made better by infirmity: even  as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy.    5. Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of  thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than  thou thinkest.  It is better for thee now to provide in time, and  to send some good before thee, than to trust to the help of  others.  If thou art not anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest  thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards?  Now the time is most  precious.  Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation.  But alas!  that thou spendest not well this time, wherein thou  mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly.  The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea, one hour,  for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt obtain.    6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free  thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live  in fear, and in expectation of death!  Strive now to live in such  wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than  fear.  Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live  with Christ.  Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then  mayest thou freely go unto Christ.  Keep under thy body by  penitence, and then shalt"]]]
