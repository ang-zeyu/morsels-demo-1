[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#6)"],[1,"a young  virgin, said an old man, I bedecked a chamber with flowers, sat with her  alone, and had fixed my eyes and heart solely upon her. Many long nights  I passed without sleep, repeating jests and pleasantries, to remove  shyness, and make her familiar. On one of these nights I said: \"Fortune  has been propitious to you, in that you have fallen into the society of  an old man, of mature judgment, who has seen the world, and experienced  various situations of good and bad fortune, who knows the rights of  society, and has performed the duties of friendship;--one who is  affectionate, affable, cheerful, and conversable. I will exert my utmost  endeavours to gain your affection, and if you should treat me unkindly I  will not be offended; or if, like the parrot, your food should be sugar,  I will devote my sweet life to your support. You have not met with a  youth of a rude disposition, with a weak understanding, headstrong, a  gadder, who would be constantly changing his situations and  inclinations, sleeping every night in a new place, and every day forming  some new intimacy. Young men may be lively and handsome, but they are  inconstant in their attachments. Look not thou for fidelity from those  who, with the eyes of the nightingale, are every instant singing upon a  different rose-bush. But old men pass their time in wisdom and good  manners, not in the ignorance and frivolity of youth. Seek one better  than yourself, and having found him, consider yourself fortunate. With  one like yourself you would pass your life without improvement.\" I spoke  a great deal after this manner (continued the old man), and thought that  I had made a conquest of her heart, when suddenly she heaved a cold sigh  from the bottom of her heart, and replied: \"All the fine speeches that  you have been uttering have not so much weight in the scale of my reason  as one single sentence I have heard from my nurse, that if you plant an  arrow in the side of a young woman it is not so painful as the society  of an old man.\" In short (continued he), it was impossible to agree, and  our differences ended in a separation. After the time prescribed by law,  she married a young man of an impetuous temper, ill-natured, and in  indigent circumstances, so that she suffered the injuries of violence,  with the evils of penury. Nevertheless she returned thanks for her lot,  and said: \"God be praised that I escaped from infernal torment, and have  obtained this permanent blessing. Amidst all your violence and  impetuosity of temper, I will put up with your airs, because you are  handsome. It is better to burn with you in hell than to be in paradise  with the other. The scent of onions from a beautiful mouth is more  fragrant than the odour of the rose from the hand of one who is ugly.\"    It must be allowed that this old man put his own case to his young wife  with very considerable address: yet, such is woman-nature, she chose to  be \"a young man's slave rather than an old man's darling.\" And,  _apropos_, Saadi has another story which may be added to the foregoing:  An old man was asked why he did not marry. He answered: \"I should not  like an old woman.\" \"Then marry a young one, since you have property.\"  Quoth he: \"Since I, who am an old man, should not be pleased with an old  woman, how can I expect that a young one would be attached to me?\"    \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\" says our great dramatist, in  proof of which take this story: A certain king, when arrived at the end  of his days, having no heir, directed in his will that the morning after  his death the first person who entered the gate of the city they should  place on his head the crown of royalty, and commit to his charge the  government of the kingdom. It happened that the first to enter the city  was a dervish, who all his life had collected victuals from the  charitable and sewed patch on patch. The ministers of state and the  nobles of the court carried out the king's will, bestowing on him the  kingdom and the treasure. For some time the dervish governed the  kingdom, until part of the nobility swerved their necks from obedience  to him, and all the neighbouring monarchs, engaging in hostile  confederacies, attacked him with their armies. In short, the troops and  peasantry were thrown into confusion, and he lost the possession of some  territories. The dervish was distressed at these events, when an old  friend, who had been his companion in the days of poverty, returned from  a journey, and, finding him in such an exalted state, said: \"Praised be  the God of excellence and glory, that your high fortune has aided you  and prosperity been your guide, so that a rose has issued from the  brier, and the thorn has been extracted from your foot, and you have  arrived at this dignity. Of a truth, joy succeeds sorrow; the bud does  sometimes blossom and sometimes wither; the tree is sometimes naked and  sometimes clothed.\" He replied: \"O brother, condole with me, for this is  not a time for congratulation. When you saw me last, I was only anxious  how to obtain bread; but now I have all the cares of the world to  encounter. If the times are adverse, I am in pain; and if they are  prosperous, I am captivated with worldly enjoyments. There is no  calamity greater than worldly affairs, because they distress the heart  in prosperity as well as in adversity. If you want riches, seek only for  contentment, which is inestimable wealth. If the rich man would throw  money into your lap, consider not yourself obliged to him, for I have  often heard that the patience of the poor is preferable to the  liberality of the rich.\"    Muezzins, who call the faithful to prayer at the prescribed hours from  the minarets of the mosques, are generally blind men, as a man with his  eyesight might spy into the domestic privacy of the citizens, who sleep  on the flat roofs of their houses in the hot season, and are selected  for their sweetness of voice. Saadi, however, tells us of a man who  performed gratuitously the office of muezzin, and had such a voice as  disgusted all who heard it. The intendant of the mosque, a good, humane  man, being unwilling to offend him, said one day: \"My friend, this  mosque has muezzins of long standing, each of whom has a monthly stipend  of ten dinars. Now I will give you ten dinars to go to another place.\"  The man agreed to this and went away. Some time after he came to the  intendant and said: \"O, my lord, you injured me in sending me away from  this station for ten dinars; for where I went they will give me twenty  dinars to remove to another place, to which I have not consented.\" The  intendant laughed, and said: \"Take care--don't accept of the offer, for  they may be willing to give you fifty.\"    To those who have \"music in their souls,\" and are \"moved by concord of  sweet sounds,\" the tones of a harsh voice are excruciating; and if among  our statesmen and other public speakers \"silver tongues\" are rare, they  are much more so among our preachers. The Church of Rome does not admit  into the priesthood men who have any bodily shortcoming or defect; it  would also be well if all candidates for holy orders in the English and  Scottish Churches whose voices are not at least tolerable were rejected,  as unfit to preach! Saadi seems to have had a great horror of braying  orators, and relates a number of anecdotes about them, such as this: A  preacher who had a detestable voice, but thought he had a very sweet  one, bawled out to no purpose. You would say the croaking of the crow in  the desert was the burden of his song, and that this verse of the Kuran  was intended for him, \"Verily the most detestable of sounds is the  braying of an ass.\" When this ass of a preacher brayed, it made  Persepolis tremble. The people of the town, on account of the  respectability of his office, submitted to the calamity, and did not  think it advisable to molest him, until one of the neighbouring  preachers, who was secretly ill-disposed towards him, came once to see  him, and said: \"I have had a dream--may it prove good!\" \"What did you  dream?\" \"I thought you had a sweet voice, and that the people were  enjoying tranquility from your discourse.\" The preacher, after  reflecting a little, replied: \"What a happy dream is this that you have  had, which has discovered to me my defect, in that I have an unpleasant  voice, and that the people are distressed at my preaching. I am resolved  that in future I will read only in a low tone. The company of friends  was disadvantageous to me, because they look on my bad manners as  excellent: my defects appear to them skill and perfection, and my thorn  as the rose and the jasmin.\"    Our author, as we have seen, enlivens his moral discourses occasionally  with humorous stories, and one or two more of these may fittingly close  the present section: One of the slaves of Amrulais having run away, a  person was sent in pursuit of him and brought him back. The vazir, being  inimical to him, commanded him to be put to death in order to deter  other slaves from committing the like offence. The slave prostrated  himself before Amrulais and said: \"Whatever may happen to me with your  approbation is lawful--what plea can the slave offer against the  sentence of his lord? But, seeing that I have been brought up under the  bounties of your house, I do not wish that at the resurrection you shall  be charged with my blood. If you are resolved to kill your slave, do so  comformably to the interpretation of the law, in order that at the  resurrection you may not suffer reproach.\" The king asked: \"After what  manner shall I expound it?\" The slave replied: \"Give me leave to kill  the vazir, and then, in retaliation for him, order me to be put to  death, that you may kill me justly.\" The king laughed, and asked the  vazir what was his advice in this matter. Quoth the vazir: \"O my lord,  as an offering to the tomb of your father, liberate this rogue, in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#6)"],[1,"nor shall they be helped.    002.087  Y: We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of  messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and  strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes  to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up  with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!    P: And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of  messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary,  clear proofs (of Allah's sovereignty), and We supported him with the  Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a  messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye  grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay?    S: And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent messengers after  him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear  arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever  then a messenger came to you with that which your souls did not desire,  you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew.    002.088  Y: They say, \"Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah's Word:  we need no more).\" Nay, Allah's curse is on them for their blasphemy:  Little is it they believe.    P: And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed  them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe.    S: And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on  account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe.    002.089  Y: And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is  with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against  those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should)  have recognised, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is  on those without Faith.    P: And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming  that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a  signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto  them that which they know (to be the truth) they disbelieve therein.  The curse of Allah is on disbelievers.    S: And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which  they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those  who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they  did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah's curse is on the  unbelievers.    002.090  Y: Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that  they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy  that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He  pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And  humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.    P: Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should  disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah  should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have  incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom.    S: Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should  deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down  of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have  made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a  disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.    002.091  Y: When it is said to them: \"Believe in what Allah Hath sent down,\"  they say, \"We believe in what was sent down to us\": yet they reject all  besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: \"Why  then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by, if ye did  indeed believe?\"    P: And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath  revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And  they disbelieve in that which cometh after it, though it is the truth  confirming that which they possess. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Why  then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye are (indeed)  believers?    S: And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has revealed, they  say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is  besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have.  Say: Why then did you kill Allah's Prophets before if you were indeed  believers?    002.092  Y: There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the  calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully.    P: And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty),  yet, while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were  wrong-doers.    S: And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you  took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust.    002.093  Y: And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the  towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We  have given you, and hearken (to the Law)\": They said: \"We hear, and we  disobey\": And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the  calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: \"Vile indeed are the behests  of your Faith if ye have any faith!\"    P: And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower  above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and  hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the  calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of  the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief  enjoineth on you, if ye are believers.    S: And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over  you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient.  They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love  of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil  is that which your belief bids you if you are believers.    002.094  Y: Say: \"If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for  anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere.\"    P: Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of  Allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye  pretend), then long for death (for ye must long for death) if ye are  truthful.    S: Say: If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to the  exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful.    002.095  Y: But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which  their hands have sent on before them. And Allah is well-acquainted with  the wrong-doers.    P: But they will never long for it, because of that which their own  hands have sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.    S: And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have  sent before, and Allah knows the unjust.    002.096  Y: Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even  more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a  life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him  from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do.    P: And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier)  than the idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live  a thousand years. And to live (a thousand years) would be no means  remove him from the doom. Allah is Seer of what they do.    S: And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life  (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves  that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being  granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the  chastisement, and Allah sees what they do.    002.097  Y: Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the  (revelation) to thy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went  before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,-    P: Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it  is who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by Allah's leave,  confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad  tidings to believers;    S: Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed it to  your heart by Allah's command, verifying that which is before it and  guidance and good news for the believers.    002.098  Y: Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to  Gabriel and Michael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith.    P: Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and  Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! Allah (Himself) is an enemy to the  disbelievers.    S: Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His messengers and  Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.    002.099  Y: We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them  but those who are perverse.    P: Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants  will disbelieve in them.    S: And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none  disbelieve in them except the transgressors.    002.100  Y: Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party  among them throw it aside?- Nay, most of them are faithless.    P: Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it  aside? The truth is, most of them believe not.    S: What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside?  Nay, most of them do not believe.    002.101  Y: And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what  was with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of  Allah behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not  know!    P: And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming  that which they possess, a party of those who have received the"]]]
