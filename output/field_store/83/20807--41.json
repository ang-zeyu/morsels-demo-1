The Eighteen  Gods have purified him in Meskha (the Great Bear), [he is] an  imperishable star. The house of Unas perisheth not in the sky, the  throne of Unas perisheth not on the earth. Men make supplication  [there], the gods fly [thither]. Septet hath made Unas fly to heaven to  be with his brethren the gods. Nut,[1] the Great Lady, hath unfolded her  arms to Unas. She hath made them into two divine souls at the head of  the Souls of Anu, under the head of Ra. She made them two weeping women  when thou wast on thy bier (?). The throne of Unas is by thee, Ra, he  yieldeth it not up to anyone else. Unas cometh forth into heaven by  thee, Ra. The face of Unas is like the [faces of the] Hawks. The wings  of Unas are like [those of] geese. The nails of Unas are like the claws  of the god Tuf. There is no [evil] word concerning Unas on earth among  men. There is no hostile speech about him with the gods. Unas hath  destroyed his word, he hath ascended to heaven. Upuatu hath made Unas  fly up to heaven among his brethren the gods. Unas hath drawn together  his arms like the Smen goose, he striketh his wings like a falcon,  flying, flying. O men, Unas flieth up into heaven.    [Footnote 1: The Sky-goddess.]    \"O ye gods of the West, O ye gods of the East, O ye gods of the South, O  ye gods of the North, ye four groups who embrace the holy lands, devote  ye yourselves to Osiris when he appeareth in heaven. He shall sail into  the Sky, with his son Horus by his fingers. He shall announce him, he  shall make him rise up like the Great God in the Sky. They shall cry out  concerning Unas: Behold Horus, the son of Osiris! Behold Unas, the  firstborn son of Hathor! Behold the seed of Keb! Osiris hath commanded  that Unas shall rise as a second Horus, and these Four Spirit-souls in  Anu have written an edict to the two great gods in the Sky. Ra set up  the Ladder[1] in front of Osiris, Horus set up the Ladder in front of  his father Osiris when he went to his spirit, one on this side [and] one  on the other side; Unas is between them. Behold, he is the god of the  pure seats coming forth from the bath (?). Unas standeth up, lo Horus;  Unas sitteth down, lo Set. Ra graspeth his hand, spirit to heaven, body  to earth.\"    [Footnote 1: The Ladder by which souls ascended to heaven. A picture of  the Ladder is given in the Papyrus of Ani, Plate XXII.]    The power of the king in heaven was almost as absolute as it was upon  earth, and in a very remarkable passage in the text of Unas, which is  repeated in the text of Teta, we have a graphic description of the king  as a mighty hunter, who chases the gods and lassoes them, and then kills  and eats them in order that he may absorb their strength and wisdom, and  all their divine attributes, and their power of living eternally. The  passage reads:    \"The skies lower, the Star-gods tremble, the Archers[1] quake, the bones  of the Akeru[1] gods tremble, and those who are with them are struck  dumb when they see Unas rising up as a soul, in the form of the god who  liveth upon his fathers, and who turneth his mothers into his food. Unas  is the lord of wisdom, and his mother knoweth not his name. The  adoration of Unas is in heaven, he hath become mighty in the horizon  like Temu, the father that gave him birth, and after Temu had given him  birth Unas became stronger than his father. The Doubles (_i.e._ vital  strength) of Unas are behind him, the soles of his feet are beneath his  feet, his gods are over him, his serpents are [seated] upon his brow,  the serpent-guides of Unas are in front of him, and the spirit of the  flame looketh upon [his] soul. The powers of Unas protect him. Unas is a  bull in heaven. He directeth his steps where he willeth. He liveth upon  the form which each god taketh upon himself, and he eateth the flesh of  those who come to fill their bellies with the magical charms in the Lake  of Fire. Unas is equipped with power against the spirit-souls thereof,  and he riseth in the form of the mighty one, the lord of those who dwell  in power (?). Unas hath taken his seat with his back turned towards Keb  (the Earth-god). Unas hath weighed his words[2] with the hidden god (?)  who hath no name, on the day of hacking in pieces the firstborn. Unas is  the lord of offerings, the untier of the knot, and he himself maketh  abundant the offerings of meat and drink. Unas devoureth men, and liveth  upon the gods, he is the lord of envoys whom he sendeth forth on his  missions. 'He who cutteth off hairy scalps,' who dwelleth in the fields,  tieth the gods with ropes. Tcheser-tep shepherdeth them for Unas and  driveth them unto him; and the Cord-master hath bound them for  slaughter. Khensu, the slayer of the wicked, cutteth their throats, and  draweth out their intestines, for it is he whom Unas sendeth to  slaughter [them], and Shesmu[3] cutteth them in pieces, and boileth  their members in his blazing caldrons of the night. Unas eateth their  magical powers, and he swalloweth their spirit-souls. The great ones  among them serve for his meal at daybreak, the lesser serve for his  meal at eventide, and the least among them serve for his meal in the  night. The old gods and the old goddesses become fuel for his furnace.  The mighty ones in heaven light the fire under the caldrons wherein are  heaped up the thighs of the firstborn; and he who maketh those who live  in heaven to go about for Unas lighteth the fire under the caldrons with  the thighs of their women; he goeth about the Two Heavens in their  entirety, and he goeth round about the two banks of the Celestial Nile.  Unas is the Great Power, the Power of Powers, and Unas is the Chief of  the gods in visible forms. Whatsoever he findeth upon his path he eateth  forthwith, and the magical might of Unas is before that of all the  spirit-bodies who dwell in the horizon. Unas is the firstborn of the  firstborn gods. Unas is surrounded by thousands, and oblations are made  unto him by hundreds; he is made manifest as the Great Power by Saah  (Orion), the father of the gods. Unas repeateth his rising in heaven,  and he is crowned lord of the horizon. He hath reckoned up the bandlets  and the arm-rings [of his captives], he hath taken possession of the  hearts of the gods. Unas hath eaten the Red Crown, and he hath swallowed  the White Crown; the food of Unas is the intestines, and his meat is  hearts and their words of power. Behold, Unas eateth of that which the  Red Crown sendeth forth, he increaseth, and the words of power of the  gods are in his belly; his attributes are not removed from him. Unas  hath eaten the whole of the knowledge of every god, and the period of  his life is eternity, and the duration of his existence is  everlastingness. He is in the form of one who doeth what he wisheth, and  who doth not do what he hateth, and he abideth on the horizon for ever  and ever and ever. The Soul of the gods is in Unas, their spirit-souls  are with Unas, and the offerings made unto him are more than those that  are made unto the gods. The fire of Unas is in their bones, for their  soul is in Unas, and their shades are with those who belong unto them.  Unas hath been with the two hidden (?) Kha (?) gods, ...; the seat of  the heart of Unas is among those who live upon this earth for ever and  ever and ever.\"    [Footnote 1: These are names of groups of stars.]    [Footnote 2: _i.e._ entered into judgment.]    [Footnote 3: The executioner of Osiris.]    The following extract is from one of the later Pyramid Texts:    \"Pepi was brought forth by the god Nu, when there was no heaven, when  there was no earth, when nothing had been established, when there was no  fighting, and when the fear of the Eye of Horus did not exist. This Pepi  is one of the Great Offspring who were brought forth in Anu  (Heliopolis), who have never been conquered by a king or ruled by  chiefs, who are irresistible, whose words cannot be gainsaid. Therefore  this Pepi is irresistible; he can neither be conquered by a king nor  ruled by chiefs. The enemies of Pepi cannot triumph. Pepi lacketh  nothing. His nails do not grow long [for want of prey]. No debt is  reckoned against Pepi. If Pepi falleth into the water Osiris will lift  him out, and the Two Companies of the Gods will bear him up on their  shoulders, and Ra, wheresoever he may be, will give him his hand. If  Pepi falleth on the earth the Earth-god (Keb) will lift him up, and the  Two Companies of the Gods will bear him up on their shoulders, and Ra,  wheresoever he may be, will give him his hand.... Pepi appeareth in  heaven among the imperishable stars. His sister the star Sothis (the  Dog-star), his guide the Morning Star (Venus) lead him by the hand to  the Field of Offerings. He taketh his seat on the crystal throne, which  hath faces of fierce lions and feet in the form of the hoofs of the Bull  Sma-ur. He standeth up in his place between the Two Great Gods, and his  sceptre and staff are in his hands. He lifteth up his hand to the  Henmemet spirits, and the gods come to him with bowings. The Two Great  Gods look on in their places, and they find Pepi acting as judge of the  gods. The word of every spirit-soul is in him, and they make offerings  to him among the Two Companies of the Gods.                                        CHAPTER III             STORIES OF MAGICIANS WHO LIVED UNDER THE ANCIENT EMPIRE      The short stories of the wonderful deeds of ancient Egyptian magicians  here given are found in the Westcar Papyrus, which is preserved in the  Royal Museum in Berlin, where it is numbered P. 3033. This papyrus was  the property of Miss Westcar of Whitchurch, who gave it to the eminent  German Egyptologist, Richard Lepsius, in 1839; it was written probably  at some period between the twelfth and eighteenth dynasties. The texts  were first edited and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#6)"],[1,"guests to breakfast, instead of two. It  was good to hear them, the lively _tink, tink-a-tink_ of their little  bills on the tin plate in a merry tattoo, as I ate my own tea and  trout thankfully. I had only to raise my eyes to see them in a bobbing  brown ring about my bounty; and, just beyond them, the lap of ripples  on the beach, the lake glinting far away in the sunshine, and a bark  canoe fretting at the landing, swinging, veering, nodding at the  ripples, and beckoning me to come away as soon as I had finished my  breakfast.    Before the little Killooleets had grown accustomed to things, however,  occurred the most delicious bit of our summer camping. It was only a  day or two after their first appearance; they knew simply that crumbs  and a welcome awaited them at my camp, but had not yet learned that  the tin plate in the cedar roots was their special portion. Simmo had  gone off at daylight, looking up beaver signs for his fall trapping. I  had just returned from the morning fishing, and was getting breakfast,  when I saw an otter come out into the lake from a cold brook over on  the east shore. Grabbing a handful of figs, and some pilot bread from  the cracker box, I paddled away after the otter; for that is an animal  which one has small chance to watch nowadays. Besides, I had found a  den over near the brook, and I wanted to find out, if possible, how a  mother otter teaches her young to swim. For, though otters live much  in the water and love it, the young ones are afraid of it as so many  kittens. So the mother--    But I must tell about that elsewhere. I did not find out that day; for  the young were already good swimmers. I watched the den two or three  hours from a good hiding place, and got several glimpses of the mother  and the little ones. On the way back I ran into a little bay where a  mother shelldrake was teaching her brood to dive and catch trout.  There was also a big frog there that always sat in the same place, and  that I used to watch. Then I thought of a trap, two miles away, which  Simmo had set, and went to see if Nemox, the cunning fisher, who  destroys the sable traps in winter, had been caught at his own game.  So it was afternoon, and I was hungry, when I paddled back to camp. It  occurred to me suddenly that Killooleet might be hungry too; for I had  neglected to feed him. He had grown sleek and comfortable of late, and  never went insect hunting when he could get cold fried trout and corn  bread.    I landed silently and stole up to the tent to see if he were exploring  under the fly, as he sometimes did when I was away. A curious sound, a  hollow _tunk, tunk, tunk, tunk-a-tunk_, grew louder as I approached. I  stole to the big cedar, where I could see the fireplace and the little  opening before my tent, and noticed first that I had left the cracker  box open (it was almost empty) when I hurried away after the otter.  The curious sound was inside, growing more eager every moment--_tunk,  tunk, tunk-a-trrrrrrr-runk, tunk, tunk!_    I crept on my hands and knees to the box, to see what queer thing had  found his way to the crackers, and peeped cautiously over the edge.  There were Killooleet, and Mrs. Killooleet, and the five little  Killooleets, just seven hopping brown backs and bobbing heads, helping  themselves to the crackers. And the sound of their bills on the empty  box made the jolliest tattoo that ever came out of a camping kit.    I crept away more cautiously than I had come, and, standing carelessly  in my tent door, whistled the call I always used in feeding the birds.  Like a flash Killooleet appeared on the edge of the cracker box,  looking very much surprised. \"I thought you were away; why, I thought  you were away,\" he seemed to be saying. Then he clucked, and the  _tunk-a-tunk_ ceased instantly. Another cluck, and Mrs. Killooleet  appeared, looking frightened; then, one after another, the five little  Killooleets bobbed up; and there they sat in a solemn row on the edge  of the cracker box, turning their heads sidewise to see me better.    \"There!\" said Killooleet, \"didn't I tell you he wouldn't hurt you?\"  And like five winks the five little Killooleets were back in the box,  and the _tunk-a-tunking_ began again.    This assurance that they might do as they pleased, and help themselves  undisturbed to whatever they found, seemed to remove the last doubt  from the mind of even the little gray mate. After that they stayed  most of the time close about my tent, and were never so far away, or  so busy insect hunting, that they would not come when I whistled and  scattered crumbs. The little Killooleets grew amazingly, and no  wonder! They were always eating, always hungry. I took good pains to  give them less than they wanted, and so had the satisfaction of  feeding them often, and of finding their tin plate picked clean  whenever I came back from fishing.    Did the woods seem lonely to Killooleet when we paddled away at last  and left the wilderness for another year? That is a question which I  would give much, or watch long, to answer. There is always a regret at  leaving a good camping ground, but I had never packed up so  unwillingly before. Killooleet was singing, cheery as ever; but my own  heart gave a minor chord of sadness to his trill that was not there  when he sang on my ridgepole. Before leaving I had baked a loaf, big  and hard, which I fastened with stakes at the foot of the old cedar,  with a tin plate under it and a bark roof above, so that when it  rained, and insects were hidden under the leaves, and their hunting  was no fun because the woods were wet, Killooleet and his little ones  would find food, and remember me. And so we paddled away and left him  to the wilderness.    A year later my canoe touched the same old landing. For ten months I  had been in the city, where Killooleet never sings, and where the  wilderness is only a memory. In the fall, on some long tramps, I had  occasional glimpses of the little singer, solitary now and silent,  stealing southward ahead of the winter. And in the spring he showed  himself rarely in the underbrush on country roads, eager, restless,  chirping, hurrying northward where the streams were clear and the big  woods budding. But never a song in all that time; my ears were hungry  for his voice as I leaped out to run eagerly to the big cedar. There  were the stakes, and the tin plate, and the bark roof all crushed by  the snows of winter. The bread was gone; what Killooleet had spared,  Tookhees the wood mouse had eaten thankfully. I found the old tent  poles and put up my house leisurely, a hundred happy memories  thronging about me. In the midst of them came a call, a clear  whistle,--and there he was, the same full cravat, the same bright cap,  and the same perfect song to set my nerves a-tingling: _I'm here,  sweet Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet!_ And when I put crumbs by the  old fireplace, he flew down to help himself, and went off with the  biggest one, as of yore, to his nest by the deer path.          III. KAGAX THE BLOODTHIRSTY.    [Illustration: Kagax]      This is the story of one day, the last one, in the life of Kagax the  Weasel, who turns white in winter, and yellow in spring, and brown in  summer, the better to hide his villainy.    It was early twilight when Kagax came out of his den in the rocks,  under the old pine that lightning had blasted. Day and night were  meeting swiftly but warily, as they always meet in the woods. The life  of the sunshine came stealing nestwards and denwards in the peace of a  long day and a full stomach; the night life began to stir in its  coverts, eager, hungry, whining. Deep in the wild raspberry thickets a  wood thrush rang his vesper bell softly; from the mountain top a night  hawk screamed back an answer, and came booming down to earth, where  the insects were rising in myriads. Near the thrush a striped chipmunk  sat chunk-a-chunking his sleepy curiosity at a burned log which a bear  had just torn open for red ants; while down on the lake shore a  cautious _plash-plash_ told where a cow moose had come out of the  alders with her calf to sup on the yellow lily roots and sip the  freshest water. Everywhere life was stirring; everywhere cries, calls,  squeaks, chirps, rustlings, which only the wood-dweller knows how to  interpret, broke in upon the twilight stillness.    Kagax grinned and showed all his wicked little teeth as the many  voices went up from lake and stream and forest. \"Mine, all mine--to  kill,\" he snarled, and his eyes began to glow deep red. Then he  stretched one sinewy paw after another, rolled over, climbed a tree,  and jumped down from a swaying twig to get the sleep all out of him.    Kagax had slept too much, and was mad with the world. The night  before, he had killed from sunset to sunrise, and much tasting of  blood had made him heavy. So he had slept all day long, only stirring  once to kill a partridge that had drummed near his den and waked him  out of sleep. But he was too heavy to hunt then, so he crept back  again, leaving the bird untasted under the end of his own drumming  log. Now Kagax was eager to make up for lost time; for all time is  lost to Kagax that is not spent in killing. That is why he runs night  and day, and barely tastes the blood of his victims, and sleeps only  an hour or two of cat naps at a time--just long enough to gather  energy for more evil doing.    As he stretched himself again, a sudden barking and snickering came  from a giant spruce on the hill just above. Meeko, the red squirrel,  had discovered a new jay's nest, and was making a sensation over it,  as he does over everything that he has not happened to see before. Had  he known who was listening, he would have risked his neck in a  headlong rush for safety; for all the wild things fear Kagax as they  fear death. But no wild thing ever knows till too late that a weasel  is near.    Kagax listened a moment, a ferocious grin"]]]
