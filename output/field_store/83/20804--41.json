The United States had been cut out when  the atlas was bought for him. But it was voted, rightly enough, that to  do this would be virtually to reveal to him what had happened, or, as  Harry Cole said, to make him think Old Burr had succeeded. So it was  from no fault of Nolan's that a great botch happened at my own table,  when, for a short time, I was in command of the George Washington  corvette, on the South American station. We were lying in the La Plata,  and some of the officers, who had been on shore, and had just joined  again, were entertaining us with accounts of their misadventures in  riding the half-wild horses of Buenos Ayres. Nolan was at table, and was  in an unusually bright and talkative mood. Some story of a tumble  reminded him of an adventure of his own, when he was catching wild  horses in Texas with his adventurous cousin, at a time when he must have  been quite a boy. He told the story with a good deal of spirit,--so much  so, that the silence which often follows a good story hung over the  table for an instant, to be broken by Nolan himself. For he asked  perfectly unconsciously:--    \"Pray, what has become of Texas? After the Mexicans got their  independence, I thought that province of Texas would come forward very  fast. It is really one of the finest regions on earth; it is the Italy  of this continent. But I have not seen or heard a word of Texas for near  twenty years.\"    There were two Texan officers at the table. The reason he had never  heard of Texas was that Texas and her affairs had been painfully cut out  of his newspapers since Austin began his settlements; so that, while he  read of Honduras and Tamaulipas, and, till quite lately, of  California,--this virgin province, in which his brother had travelled so  far, and, I believe, had died, had ceased to be to him. Waters and  Williams, the two Texas men, looked grimly at each other, and tried not  to laugh. Edward Morris had his attention attracted by the third link in  the chain of the captain's chandelier. Watrous was seized with a  convulsion of sneezing. Nolan himself saw that something was to pay, he  did not know what. And I, as master of the feast, had to say,--    \"Texas is out of the map, Mr. Nolan. Have you seen Captain Back's  curious account of Sir Thomas Roe's Welcome?\"    After that cruise I never saw Nolan again. I wrote to him at least twice  a year, for in that voyage we became even confidentially intimate; but  he never wrote to me. The other men tell me that in those fifteen years  he _aged_ very fast, as well he might indeed, but that he was still the  same gentle, uncomplaining, silent sufferer that he ever was, bearing as  best he could his self-appointed punishment,--rather less social,  perhaps, with new men whom he did not know, but more anxious,  apparently, than ever to serve and befriend and teach the boys, some of  whom fairly seemed to worship him. And now it seems the dear old fellow  is dead. He has found a home at last, and a country.           *       *       *       *       *    Since writing this, and while considering whether or no I would print  it, as a warning to the young Nolans and Vallandighams and Tatnalls of  to-day of what it is to throw away a country, I have received from  Danforth, who is on board the Levant, a letter which gives an account  of Nolan's last hours. It removes all my doubts about telling this  story.    To understand the first words of the letter, the non-professional reader  should remember that after 1817, the position of every officer who had  Nolan in charge was one of the greatest delicacy. The government had  failed to renew the order of 1807 regarding him. What was a man to do?  Should he let him go? What, then, if he were called to account by the  Department for violating the order of 1807? Should he keep him? What,  then, if Nolan should be liberated some day, and should bring an action  for false imprisonment or kidnapping against every man who had had him  in charge? I urged and pressed this upon Southard, and I have reason to  think that other officers did the same thing. But the Secretary always  said, as they so often do at Washington, that there were no special  orders to give, and that we must act on our own judgment. That means,  \"If you succeed, you will be sustained; if you fail, you will be  disavowed.\" Well, as Danforth says, all that is over now, though I do  not know but I expose myself to a criminal prosecution on the evidence  of the very revelation I am making.    Here is the letter:--           *       *       *       *       *    \"LEVANT, 2 deg. 2' S. @ 131 deg. W.    \"DEAR FRED:--I try to find heart and life to tell you that it is all  over with dear old Nolan. I have been with him on this voyage more than  I ever was, and I can understand wholly now the way in which you used  to speak of the dear old fellow. I could see that he was not strong, but  I had no idea the end was so near. The doctor has been watching him very  carefully, and yesterday morning came to me and told me that Nolan was  not so well, and had not left his state-room,--a thing I never remember  before. He had let the doctor come and see him as he lay there,--the  first time the doctor had been in the state-room,--and he said he should  like to see me. O dear! do you remember the mysteries we boys used to  invent about his room, in the old Intrepid days? Well, I went in, and  there, to be sure, the poor fellow lay in his berth, smiling pleasantly  as he gave me his hand, but looking very frail. I could not help a  glance round, which showed me what a little shrine he had made of the  box he was lying in. The stars and stripes were triced up above and  around a picture of Washington, and he had painted a majestic eagle,  with lightnings blazing from his beak and his foot just clasping the  whole globe, which his wings overshadowed. The dear old boy saw my  glance, and said, with a sad smile, 'Here, you see, I have a country!'  And then he pointed to the foot of his bed, where I had not seen before  a great map of the United States, as he had drawn it from memory, and  which he had there to look upon as he lay. Quaint, queer old names were  on it, in large letters: 'Indiana Territory,' 'Mississippi Territory,'  and 'Louisiana Territory,' as I suppose our fathers learned such  things: but the old fellow had patched in Texas, too; he had carried his  western boundary all the way to the Pacific, but on that shore he had  defined nothing.    \"'O Danforth,' he said, 'I know I am dying. I cannot get home. Surely  you will tell me something now?--Stop! stop! Do not speak till I say  what I am sure you know, that there is not in this ship, that there is  not in America,--God bless her!--a more loyal man than I. There cannot  be a man who loves the old flag as I do, or prays for it as I do, or  hopes for it as I do. There are thirty-four stars in it now, Danforth. I  thank God for that, though I do not know what their names are. There has  never been one taken away: I thank God for that. I know by that that  there has never been any successful Burr. O Danforth, Danforth,' he  sighed out, 'how like a wretched night's dream a boy's idea of personal  fame or of separate sovereignty seems, when one looks back on it after  such a life as mine! But tell me,--tell me something,--tell me  everything, Danforth, before I die!'    \"Ingham, I swear to you that I felt like a monster that I had not told  him everything before. Danger or no danger, delicacy or no delicacy, who  was I, that I should have been acting the tyrant all this time over this  dear, sainted old man, who had years ago expiated, in his whole  manhood's life, the madness of a boy's treason? 'Mr. Nolan,' said I, 'I  will tell you every thing you ask about. Only, where shall I begin?'    \"O the blessed smile that crept over his white face! and he pressed my  hand and said, 'God bless you' 'Tell me their names,' he said, and he  pointed to the stars on the flag. 'The last I know is Ohio. My father  lived in Kentucky. But I have guessed Michigan and Indiana and  Mississippi,--that was where Fort Adams is,--they make twenty. But where  are your other fourteen? You have not cut up any of the old ones, I  hope?'    \"Well, that was not a bad text, and I told him the names in as good  order as I could, and he bade me take down his beautiful map and draw  them in as I best could with my pencil. He was wild with delight about  Texas, told me how his cousin died there; he had marked a gold cross  near where he supposed his grave was; and he had guessed at Texas. Then  he was delighted as he saw California and Oregon;--that, he said, he had  suspected partly, because he had never been permitted to land on that  shore, though the ships were there so much. 'And the men,' said he,  laughing, 'brought off a good deal besides furs.' Then he went  back--heavens, how far!--to ask about the Chesapeake, and what was done  to Barron for surrendering her to the Leopard, and whether Burr ever  tried again,--and he ground his teeth with the only passion he showed.  But in a moment that was over, and he said, 'God forgive me, for I am  sure I forgive him.' Then he asked about the old war,--told me the true  story of his serving the gun the day we took the Java,--asked about  dear old David Porter, as he called him. Then he settled down more  quietly, and very happily, to hear me tell in an hour the history of  fifty years.    \"How I wished it had been somebody who knew something! But I did as well  as I could. I told him of the English war. I told him about Fulton and  the steamboat beginning. I told him about old Scott, and Jackson; told  him all I could think of about the Mississippi, and New Orleans, and  Texas, and his own old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#6)"],[1," of opinion that, nearer, there  is much less depth, and secure riding; and in the neighbourhood is plenty  of fresh water and wood for fuel. The whole isle, from the sea-shore to the  summits of the hills, seemed to be covered with the latter; and every  valley produced a fine stream of the former. We saw people on the shore,  and some canoes on the coast, but none came off to us. Leaving the bay just  mentioned, we stretched across the channel which divides Aurora from  Whitsuntide Island. At noon we were abreast the north end of this latter,  which bore E.N.E., and observed in 15 deg. 28' 1/2. The isle of Aurora bore  from N. to N.E. 1/2 east, and the Isle of Lepers from N. by W. 1/2 W. to  west. Whitsuntide Isle appeared joined to the land to the S. and S.W. of  it; but in stretching to S.W. we discovered the separation. This was about  four o'clock p.m., and then we tacked and stretched in for the island till  near sun-set, when the wind veering more to the east, made it necessary to  resume our course to the south. We saw people on the shore, smokes in many  parts of the island, and several places which seemed to be cultivated.  About midnight, drawing near the south land, we tacked and stretched to the  north, in order to spend the remainder of the night.    At day-break on the 21st, we found ourselves before the channel that  divides Whitsuntide Island from the south land, which is about two leagues  over. At this time, the land to the southward extended from S. by E. round  to the west, farther than the eye could reach, and on the part nearest to  us, which is of considerable height, we observed two very large columns of  smoke, which, I judged, ascended from volcanoes. We now stood S.S.W., with  a fine breeze at S.E.; and, at ten o'clock, discovered this part of the  land to be an island, which is called by the natives Ambrym. Soon after an  elevated land appeared open off the south end of Ambrym; and after that,  another still higher, on which is a high peaked hill. We judged these lands  to belong to two separate islands. The first came in sight at S.E.; the  second at E. by S., and they appeared to be ten leagues distant. Holding on  our course for the land ahead, at noon it was five miles distant from us,  extending from S.S.E. to N.W. by W., and appeared to be continued. The  islands to the east bore from N.E. by E. to S.E. by E., latitude observed  16 deg. 17' south. As we drew nearer the shore we discovered a creek, which had  the appearance of being a good harbour, formed by a low point or peninsula,  projecting out to the north. On this a number of people were assembled, who  seemed to invite us ashore; probably with no good intent, as the most of  them were armed with bows and arrows. In order to gain room and time to  hoist out and arm our boats, to reconnoitre this place, we tacked and made  a trip off, which occasioned the discovery of another port about a league  more to the south. Having sent two armed boats to sound and look for  anchorage, on their making the signal for the latter, we sailed in S.S.W.,  and anchored in eleven fathoms water, not two cables' length from the S.E.  shore, and a mile within the entrance.    We had no sooner anchored than several of the natives came off in canoes.  They were very cautious at first; but, at last, trusted themselves  alongside, and exchanged, for pieces of cloth, arrows; some of which were  pointed with bone, and dipped in some green gummy substance, which we  naturally supposed was poisonous. Two men having ventured on board, after a  short stay, I sent them away with presents. Others, probably induced by  this, came off by moon-light; but I gave orders to permit none to come  alongside, by which means we got clear of them for the night.    Next morning early, a good many came round us, some in canoes, and others  swimming. I soon prevailed on one to come on board, which be no sooner did,  than he was followed by more than I desired; so that not only our deck, but  rigging, was presently filled with them. I took four into the cabin, and  gave them various articles, which they shewed to those in the canoes, and  seemed much pleased with their reception. While I was thus making friends  with those in the cabin, an accident happened that threw all into  confusion, but in the end, I believe, proved advantageous to us. A fellow  in a canoe having been refused admittance into one of our boats that lay  alongside, bent his bow to shoot a poisoned arrow at the boat-keeper. Some  of his countrymen prevented his doing it that instant, and gave time to  acquaint me with it. I ran instantly on deck, and saw another man  struggling with him; one of those who had been in the cabin, and had leaped  out of the window for this purpose. The other seemed resolved, shook him  off, and directed his bow again to the boat-keeper; but, on my calling to  him, pointed it at me. Having a musquet in my hand loaded with small shot,  I gave him the contents. This staggered him for a moment, but did not  prevent him from holding his bow still in the attitude of shooting. Another  discharge of the same nature made him drop it, and the others, who were in  the canoe, to paddle off with all speed. At this time, some began to shoot  arrows on the other side. A musquet discharged in the air had no effect;  but a four-pound shot over their heads sent them off in the utmost  confusion. Many quitted their canoes and swam on shore; those in the great  cabin leaped out of the windows; and those who were on the deck, and on  different parts of the rigging, all leaped overboard. After this we took no  farther notice of them, but suffered them to come off and pick up their  canoes; and some of them even ventured alongside of the ship. Immediately  after the great gun was fired, we heard the beating of drums on shore;  which was, probably, the signal for the country to assemble in arms. We now  got every thing in readiness to land, to cut some wood, which we were in  want of, and to try to get some refreshments, nothing of this kind having  been seen in any of the canoes.    About nine o'clock, we put off in two boats, and landed in the face of four  or five hundred people, who were assembled on the shore. Though they were  all armed with bows and arrows, clubs and spears, they made not the least  opposition. On the contrary, seeing me advance alone, with nothing but a  green branch in my hand, one of them, who seemed to be a chief, giving his  bow and arrows to another, met me in the water, bearing also a green  branch, which having exchanged for the one I held, he then took me by the  hand, and led me up to the crowd. I immediately distributed presents to  them, and, in the mean time, the marines were drawn up upon the beach. I  then made signs (for we understood not a word of their language) that we  wanted wood; and they made signs to us to cut down the trees. By this time,  a small pig being brought down and presented to me, I gave the bearer a  piece of cloth, with which he seemed well pleased. This made us hope that  we should soon have some more; but we were mistaken. The pig was not  brought to be exchanged for what we had, but on some other account,  probably as a peace-offering. For, all we could say or do, did not prevail  on them to bring down, after this, above half a dozen cocoa-nuts, and a  small quantity of fresh water. They set no value on nails, or any sort of  iron tools; nor indeed on any thing we had. They would, now and then,  exchange an arrow for a piece of cloth; but very seldom would part with a  bow. They were unwilling we should go off the beach, and very desirous we  should return on board. At length, about noon, after sending what wood we  had cut on board, we embarked ourselves; and they all retired, some one way  and some another. Before we had dined, the afternoon was too far spent to  do any thing on shore; and all hands were employed, setting up the rigging,  and repairing some defects in it. But seeing a man bring along the strand a  buoy, which they had taken in the night from the kedge-anchor, I went on  shore for it, accompanied by some of the gentlemen. The moment we landed,  it was put into the boat, by a man who walked off again without speaking  one word. It ought to be observed, that this was the only thing they took,  or even attempted to take from us, by any means whatever. Being landed near  one of their plantations and houses, which were just within the skirts of  the wood, I prevailed on the man to conduct me to them; but, though they  suffered Mr Forster to go with me, they were unwilling any more should  follow. These houses were something like those of the other isles; rather  low, and covered with palm thatch. Some were enclosed, or walled round with  boards; and the entrance to those was by a square hole at one end, which at  this time was shut up, and they were unwilling to open it for us to look  in. There were here about six houses, and some small plantations of roots,  etc., fenced round with reeds as at the Friendly Isles. There were,  likewise, some bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, and plaintain trees; but very little  fruit on any of them. A good many fine yams were piled up upon sticks, or a  kind of raised platform; and about twenty pigs, and a few fowls, were  running about loose. After making these observations, having embarked, we  proceeded to the S.E. point of the harbour, where we again landed and  walked along the bench till we could see the islands to the S.E. already  mentioned. The names of these we now obtained, as well as the name of that  on which we were. This they called Mallicollo;* the island that first  appeared over the south end of Ambrym is called Apee; and the other with  the hill upon it Paoom. We found on the beach a fruit like an orange,  called by them Abbimora; but whether it be fit for eating, I cannot say, as  this was decayed.    [* Or Mallicolla.
