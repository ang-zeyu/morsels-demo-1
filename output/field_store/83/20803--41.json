[Illustration: Fig. 48. The Wall Tent with the Fly fastened on.]      TENT FLY.    [Illustration: Fig. 49. The Fly Ridge Pole.]    Again we had to visit the village storekeeper; this time we bought out  his whole remaining stock, sixteen yards of drill. This was cut into  four-yard strips, which were sewed together as before and the ends  turned up and hemmed. Tie strings were sewed to the ends of the strips  so that the fly could be tied to the wall ropes of the tent. At the  ridge the fly was supported about six inches above the tent rope by a  second ridge pole held by pegs in the top holes of the tent posts.      PROVISIONS AND SUPPLIES.    The ten days before Uncle Ed arrived were busy indeed. We had to gather  together the necessary provisions and supplies. Our personal outfits  were very simple. Each member supplied himself with a change of  underwear, a bathing suit, a blanket and a toothbrush. A single comb and  brush served for the entire society, and was used on Sundays, the only  day we really dressed up. All the rest of the time we lived in our  bathing suits, except, of course, on cold rainy days. Our kitchen outfit  consisted of a large cooking pot, two kettles, a frying pan, a coffee  pot, a small oil stove, a half-dozen each of plates, cups, saucers,  knives and forks, a dozen spoons, two tablespoons, and, in addition,  several large plates and bowls for pantry use. We also took with us a  dish-pan and several dish-towels. For our larder we collected the  following: A bag of flour, ten pounds of sugar, two pounds of salt,  three pounds of coffee, four pounds of oatmeal, four pounds of butter,  two pounds of lard, six pound of beans, six pounds of rice, three pounds  of bacon, six cans of condensed milk, a dozen eggs, box of pepper, and  several jars of canned peaches and pears, and also a half dozen glasses  of jelly.    It was Dutchy who suggested that we have a chicken yard, in connection  with our camp, to supply us with fresh eggs. It was a capital idea, and  by the dint of some coaxing we managed to secure the loan of a half  dozen hens and a rooster.    Our miscellaneous list included a spade, pick and shovel, an ax, a  hatchet, two large pails, a barn lantern, a can of kerosene, a dozen  candles, a cocoa box filled with matches, a pair of scissors, needles,  buttons, pins and safety pins, a spool of white and another of black  cotton, fishing tackle, a roll of heavy twine, a coil of rope, and a set  of dominoes and checkers. But most important of all was a chest of tools  belonging to Reddy. These were all collected when Uncle Ed arrived.  Dutchy also contributed a large compass, which we found very useful  later on, for surveying the island.      CROSSBOW.    Reddy had a shotgun which he wanted to bring along, but my father, and  Dutchy's as well, wouldn't let us go camping if there was to be any  gunpowder along, so we had to leave it behind. Of course we didn't miss  it at all when we got to the island, because there was so much else to  do; but we all agreed with Dutchy, that \"it wouldn't be no sort of a  scientific expedition without takin' a gun along.\" As a substitute I  suggested a bow and arrow. They all laughed at such a \"kiddish\" idea;  all but Bill, I mean.    [Illustration: Drifting down the Schreiners' Brook.]    [Illustration: Paddling in the Old Scow.]    [Illustration: Fig. 50. Binding the Bow.]    [Illustration: Fig. 51. The Trigger.]    [Illustration: Fig. 52. The Trigger Set for Firing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 53. The Umbrella Rib Crossbow.]    \"It ain't such a bad notion,\" said he, \"only a crossbow would be better.  I've seen them made out of umbrella ribs so they'd shoot like greased  lightning.\" Of course we had to have one of these wonderful weapons.  Down in the ash heap we found two broken umbrellas with 27-inch ribs.  Bill selected ten good ribs, from which he wrenched off the spreaders  with a pair of pliers. The ribs were then bound together by winding  stout twine around them. The winding was very evenly and closely done,  so that the cord completely covered the ribs, making a solid rod of  spring steel. But before winding we had laid in between the ribs a piece  of heavy twine, to which the bowstrings could be tied after the bow was  all wound. The stock of our crossbow was cut out of a board of soft wood  1 inch thick to as near the shape of a gun as we could get it. A hole  was drilled through the muzzle end to receive the bow, and then the  bowstring was tied fast. Along the upper edge of the barrel a V-shaped  channel was cut. The channel was not very deep, only enough to receive a  tenpenny nail with the head projecting half-way above the sides. A notch  was cut across the barrel, through this channel, at the trigger end, and  a trigger made of heavy iron wire, bent to the shape shown in Fig. 51,  was hinged to the gun by a bolt which passed clear through the stock and  through both eyes of the trigger. By using two nuts on the bolt, and  tightening one against the other, they were prevented from working loose  and coming off. When we wanted to fire the gun the bowstring was drawn  back, and held by slipping it into the notch, and a nail was laid in the  channel with its head against the bowstring. Then, on pulling the  trigger, the bowstring was lifted out of the notch, and sent the nail  off sailing. The long-grooved barrel insured a very good aim.      MEGAPHONE.    [Illustration: Fig. 54. The Megaphone.]    [Illustration: Fig. 55. Layout of the Megaphone.]    [Illustration: Fig. 56. Brass Fastener.]    [Illustration: Fig. 57. The Mouthpiece.]    Another device we made in preparation for the expedition was a  megaphone. A sheet of light cardboard 30 inches square was procured. At  the center of one edge a pin was stuck into the cardboard, then a piece  of stout thread was looped over the pin and the two ends were knotted  together just 5 inches from the pin. Another knot was also made 29  inches from the pin. Now, with a pencil hooked into the loop, and  resting first against the inner knot and then against the outer one, two  arcs were drawn on the paper, one of 5-inch radius and the other of  29-inch radius. A line was now drawn from the pin to the point where the  longer arc met the right hand edge of the paper, and a dotted line was  drawn from the pin to a point 1-1/2 inches from the edge at the other  end of the arc. From a point 1 inch to the left of the pin we then drew  a line to the left end of the arc. With a scissors we cut the cardboard  along the arcs and straight lines, all but the dotted line, leaving a  piece of the shape shown in Fig. 55. This piece was rolled into a cone  with the right edge lapped over the left edge and lying against the  dotted line. In this position it was held by means of several brass  fasteners of the kind shown in Fig. 56.    A mouthpiece was formed out of a block of wood in which a large hole had  been drilled. The block was then cut away until the walls were quite  thin. The hole was reamed out at the top, as shown in Fig. 57, and the  outer surface was tapered so that the small end of the megaphone would  fit snugly on it.    We planned to reach our camping grounds by way of the canal, and had  provided for that purpose a large scow, which we expected to tow up to  Lumberville and drag over to the river.      THE SCOW.    [Illustration: Fig. 58. Side pieces of the Scow.]    [Illustration: Fig. 59. Frame of the Scow.]    [Illustration: Fig. 60. Nailing on the Bottom.]    [Illustration: Fig. 61. Sockets for Rowlocks.]    [Illustration: Fig. 62. Thole Pin.]    [Illustration: Fig. 63. Nailing on the Decks.]    [Illustration: Fig. 64. The Oar.]    Our scow was made as follows: Two 3/4-inch pine boards, 12 inches wide  and 12 feet long, were selected from Reddy's father's lumber pile. These  were used for the side pieces of the boat, and we tapered them off at  the end to a width of 3-1/2 inches. This was done by making a straight  cut from the end to a point three feet back along the edge of the board  and then rounding off the edge with a draw-knife. When one board had  been shaped, it was used as a pattern for the other, which was thus cut  to exactly the same size. For the end pieces two strips, 4 inches wide  and 2 feet 10-1/2 inches long, were sawed out of a 1-inch board. Then  for the bottom we procured a number of 3/4-inch boards, 12 feet long and  8 inches wide, which we cut into 3-foot lengths. At Bill's suggestion,  before nailing the parts together, we secured some strips of flannel,  which were saturated with paint, and laid between the seams so as to  make the boat perfectly water-tight. The side and end boards were then  nailed together, with the strips of flannel between, the side boards  overlapping the end boards, as shown in Fig. 59. After planing down the  end boards until their edges laid flush with the edges of the side  pieces, the bottom boards were nailed on, strips of cloth being inserted  between them, as well as along the edges of the side and end boards. To  brace the bottom a 3/4-inch board was placed at the center, inside the  boat, and bent down against the floor, to which it was nailed with wire  nails. The nails were driven into the board from the outer side of the  boat and were clinched inside. Along the upper edges of the side boards  two strips 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick were nailed. Two notches were  cut in the inner side of each strip before it was nailed on. The notches  were 1/2 inch deep, 1-1/2 inches wide, 3 inches apart and about 5-1/2  feet from the stern end. When the strips were nailed in place these  notches formed sockets to receive the rowlocks. A strip was also nailed  across the stern of the boat and formed with two central notches, to  receive the rowlocks for a steering oar. This strip, however, was 3  inches wide, and projected 1 inch above the end board, so as to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#6)"],[1,"her most aggravating tone.    \"But you must.--Mustn't she, mother?\"    \"You ought to, Kathleen,\" said Mrs. Tennant. \"You have been sent here to  learn. Alice can teach you; she can help you very much. She means to be  very kind to you. You certainly ought to do what she suggests.\"    \"But I am afraid,\" said Kathleen, \"that I am not going to do what I  ought. I don't wish to be good at all to-day. I couldn't live if I  wasn't really naughty sometimes. I mean to be terribly naughty all the  afternoon. If you will let me have my fling, I do assure you, Mrs.  Tennant, that I will work off the steam, and will be all right  to-morrow. I must do something desperate, and if Alice opposes me I'll  have to do something worse.\"    \"You are a clipper!\" said David Tennant, smiling into her face.    \"All right, my boy; I expect I am,\" said Kathleen; and then she added,  springing to her feet, \"I have eaten enough, and for what we have  received--Good-bye, Mrs. Tennant; I'm off.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE HOME-SICK AND THE REBELLIOUS.      Kathleen O'Hara ran up to an untidy room. She banged-to the door, and  standing by it for a moment, drew the bolt. Thus she had secured herself  against intrusion. She then flung herself on the bed, put her two arms  under her head, and gazed out of the window. Her heart was beating  wildly; she had a strange medley of feelings within. She was  desperately, madly lonely. She was homesick in the most intense sense of  the word.    Kathleen had never left Carrigrohane Castle before. This romantic abode  was situated in the extreme south-west of Ireland. It was a mile away  from the sea, and stood on a rocky eminence which overlooked a very wide  expanse of moor and wood, rushing streams and purple mountains, and deep  dark-blue sea. In the whole world there could scarcely be found a more  lovely view than that which since her birth had presented itself before  Kathleen's young eyes. Her father, Squire O'Hara, was, as landlords in  Ireland go, very well off. His tenantry adored him. He got in his rents  with tolerable regularity. He was a good landlord, firm but also kind  and indulgent. A real case of distress was never turned away from his  doors, but where rent could be paid he insisted on the cottars giving  him his due. He kept a rather wild establishment, however. His wife was  an Irishwoman from a neighboring county, and had some of the most  careless attributes of her race. The house got along anyhow. There were  always shoals of visitors, mostly relatives. There were heavy feasts in  the old hall, and sittings up very late at night, and no end of hunting  and fishing and shooting in their seasons. In the summer a pretty white  yacht made a great \"divartisement,\" as the Squire was fond of saying;  and in all things Kathleen O'Hara was free as the air she breathed. She  was educated in a sort of fashion by an Irish governess, but in reality  she was allowed to pursue her lessons exactly as she liked best herself.    It was just before she was fifteen that Kathleen's aunt, a maiden lady  from Dublin, who rejoiced in the truly Irish name of O'Flynn, came to  see them, remarked on Kathleen's wild, unkempt appearance, declared that  the girl would be a downright beauty when she was eighteen, said that no  one would tolerate such a want of knowledge in the present day, and  advised that she should go to school. Mrs. O'Hara took Miss O'Flynn's  hint very much to heart. Kathleen was consulted, and of course tabooed  the entire scheme; in the end, however, the elder ladies carried the  day. Miss O'Flynn took her niece to Dublin with her, and gave her an  expensive and very unnecessary wardrobe; and Mrs. O'Hara, having heard a  great deal of Mrs. Tennant, who had Irish relatives, decided that  Kathleen should go to the Great Shirley School, where she herself had  been educated long ago. Everything was arranged in a great hurry. It  seemed to Kathleen now, as she lay on her bed, kicking her feet  impatiently, and ruffled her beautiful hair, that the thing had come to  pass in a flash. It seemed only yesterday that she was at home in the  old house, petted by the servants, adored by her father, worshipped by  all her relatives--the young queen of the castle, free as the air,  followed by her dogs, riding on her pony--and now she was here in this  hideous, poor, fifth-class house, going to that ugly school.    \"I can't stand it,\" she thought. \"There's only one way out. I must have  a real desperate burst of naughtiness. What shall I do that will most  aggravate them? For do that thing I will, and as quickly as possible.\"    Kathleen thought rapidly. She had no brothers of her own, but their loss  was made up for by the adoration of about twenty young cousins who were  always loafing about the place and following Kathleen wherever she  turned.    \"What would most aggravate Pat if he were here,\" thought the girl, \"or  dear old Michael? Ah, well! Michael--\" The girl's face slightly changed.  \"I was never _very_ naughty with Michael,\" she said to herself. \"He is  different from the others. I wouldn't like to see that sort of sorry  look in his dear dark-blue eyes. Oh, I mustn't think of Michael now.  When I was going away he said, 'Bedad, you'll come back a princess, and  I'll be proud to see you.' No, I mustn't think of Michael. Pat, the imp,  would help me, and so would Rory, and so would Ted. But what shall it  be?\"    She thought excitedly. There came a rattle at the handle of the door.    \"Let me in, please, Kathleen; let me in,\" called Alice's voice.    \"Presently, darling,\" replied Kathleen in her most nonchalant tone.    \"But I am in a hurry. I must be back at school by half-past two. Let me  in immediately.\"    \"What a nuisance it all is!\" thought Kathleen. \"But, after all, my  naughtiness needn't make that stupid old Alice late for her darling  lessons.\"    She scrambled off the bed, drew back the bolt, and returned to her old  position. Alice came quickly in. She glanced at Kathleen with disgust.    \"I wish you wouldn't lie on the bed in your muddy boots.\"    No answer.    \"I must ask you not to lock the door. It is my room as well as yours.\"    No answer. Kathleen's eyes were fixed on the window; they were brimful  of mischief. After a time she said:    \"Darling.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't talk to me in that silly way.\"    \"Faith! honey, then.\"    \"I do wish--\"    Kathleen suddenly sprang upright on her bed.    \"Don't you like the sky when it looks as it does now? I wish you could  see it from Carrigrohane. You don't know the sort of expression it has  when it seems to be kissing the sea. We have a ghost at Carrigrohane.  Oh, wisha, then, if you only could see it! I can tell the boys about it.  Sha'n't I make them creep?\"    \"It is very silly to talk about ghosts. Nobody believes in them,\" said  Alice.    \"I'll ask father if I may have you at Carrigrohane in the summer, and  then see if you don't believe. She wears white.\"    \"I am going out now, Kathleen; aren't you coming with me?\"    \"No, thank you, my love.\"    \"You ought to, Kathleen. I am busy preparing for my scholarship  examination or I would stay and argue with you. It is an awful pity to  have gone to the expense of coming here if you don't mean to do your  utmost.\"    \"Thank you, darling, but it is rather a waste of breath for you to talk  so long to me. I mean to be naughty this afternoon.\"    \"I can't help you,\" said Alice. \"I am very sorry you ever came.\"    \"Thank you so much, dear.\"    Alice ran downstairs.    \"Mother,\" she said, rushing into her mother's presence, \"we shall have  no end of trouble with that terrible girl. She is lying now on the bed  with her outdoor boots on, and she won't come to school, or do a single  thing I want her to.\"    \"The money her father pays will be very welcome, Alice. We must bear  with some discomforts on account of that.\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Alice, shrugging her shoulders. \"How horrid it is  to be poor, and to have such a girl as that in the house! Well, I can't  stay another minute. You had better keep a sort of general eye on her,  mother, for there's no saying what she will do. She has declared her  intention of being naughty. She knows no fear, is not guided by any sort  of principle, and would, in short, do anything.\"    \"Well, go to school, Alice, and be quick home, for I have a great deal I  want you to help me with.\"    Alice made no reply, and Mrs. Tennant, after thinking for a minute, went  upstairs. She knocked at the door of the room which she had given up to  the two girls. There was no answer. She opened it and went in. The bird  had flown. There were evident signs of a stampede through the window,  for it stood wide open, and there were marks of not too clean boots on  the drugget, and a torn piece of ivy just without. The window was twenty  feet from the ground, and Kathleen must have let herself down by the  sturdy arm of the old ivy. Mrs. Tennant looked out, half expecting to  see a mangled body on the ground; but there was no one in view. She  returned to her darning and her anxious thoughts.    She was a widow with two sons and a daughter, and something under two  hundred and fifty pounds a year on which to live. To educate the boys,  to do something for Alice, and to put bread-and-butter into all their  mouths was a difficult problem to solve in these expensive days. She had  on purpose moved close to the Great Shirley School in order to avail  herself of its cheap education for Alice. The boys went to another  foundation school near by; and altogether the family managed to scrape  along. But the advent of Kathleen on the scene was a great relief, for  her father paid three guineas a week for Mrs. Tennant's motherly care  and for Kathleen's board and lodging.    \"Poor child!\" thought the good woman. \"What a wild, undisciplined,  handsome creature she is! I must do what I can for her.\"    She sat on for some time darning and thinking. Her heart was full; she  "]]]
