Once more they said,  \"Constantinople is a place of passage and of sojourn for various races and  peoples; among them are many Persians.\" For this reason the Persians had  Him further exiled to Rumelia; but, when there, the flame became more  powerful, and the Cause more exalted. At last the Persians said, \"Not one  of these places is safe from his influence; we must send him to some place  where he will be reduced to powerlessness, and where his family and  followers will have to submit to the direst afflictions.\" So they chose  the prison of Akka, which is reserved especially for murderers, thieves  and highway robbers, and in truth they classed Him with such people. But  the power of God became manifested: His word was promulgated, and the  greatness of Baha'u'llah then became evident, for it was from this prison  and under such humiliating circumstances that He caused Persia to advance  from one state into another state. He overcame all His enemies and proved  to them that they could not resist the Cause. His holy teachings  penetrated all regions, and His Cause was established.    Indeed, in all parts of Persia His enemies arose against Him with the  greatest hatred, imprisoning, killing and beating His converts, and  burning and razing to the ground thousands of dwellings, striving by every  means to exterminate and crush the Cause. In spite of all this, from the  prison of murderers, highway robbers and thieves, it became exalted. His  teachings were spread abroad, and His exhortations affected many of those  who had been the most full of hatred, and made them firm believers. Even  the Persian government itself became awakened and regretted that which had  arisen through the fault of the 'ulama.    When Baha'u'llah came to this prison in the Holy Land, the wise men  realized that the glad tidings which God gave through the tongue of the  Prophets two or three thousand years before were again manifested, and  that God was faithful to His promise; for to some of the Prophets He had  revealed and given the good news that \"the Lord of Hosts should be  manifested in the Holy Land.\" All these promises were fulfilled; and it is  difficult to understand how Baha'u'llah could have been obliged to leave  Persia, and to pitch His tent in this Holy Land, but for the persecution  of His enemies, His banishment and exile. His enemies intended that His  imprisonment should completely destroy and annihilate the blessed Cause,  but this prison was in reality of the greatest assistance and became the  means of its development. The divine renown of Baha'u'llah reached the  East and the West, and the rays of the Sun of Truth illuminated all the  world. Praise be to God! though He was a prisoner, His tent was raised on  Mount Carmel, and He moved abroad with the greatest majesty. Every person,  friend or stranger, who came into His presence used to say, \"This is a  prince, not a captive.\"    Upon His arrival in prison(21) He addressed an epistle to Napoleon,(22)  which He sent through the French ambassador. The gist of it was, \"Ask what  is Our crime, and why We are confined in this prison and this dungeon.\"  Napoleon made no reply. Then a second epistle was issued, which is  contained in the Suriy-i-Haykal.(23) The epitome of it is: \"Oh Napoleon,  as thou hast not listened to My proclamation, and as thou hast not  answered it, thy dominion will before long be taken away from thee, and  thou wilt be utterly destroyed.\" This epistle was sent to Napoleon by  post, through the care of Cesar Ketaphakou,(24) as was known to all the  companions of His exile. The text of this warning reached the whole of  Persia, for it was at that time that the Kitab-i-Haykal was spread in  Persia, and this epistle was among the contents of this book. This  happened in A.D. 1869, and as this Suriy-i-Haykal was circulated in Persia  and India and was in the hands of all believers, they were waiting to see  what would come to pass. Not long after, in A.D. 1870, the war between  Germany and France broke out; and though no one at that time expected the  victory of Germany, Napoleon was defeated and dishonored; he surrendered  to his enemies, and his glory was changed into deep abasement.    Tablets(25) were also sent to other kings, and among them was the letter  to H. M. Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah. In that epistle Baha'u'llah said, \"Have Me  summoned, gather the 'ulama, and ask for proofs and arguments, so that the  truth and falsehood may become known.\" H. M. Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah sent the  blessed epistle to the 'ulama and proposed to them that they should  undertake this mission, but they dared not do so. Then he asked seven of  the most celebrated among them to write an answer to the challenge. After  some time they returned the blessed letter, saying, \"This man is the  opposer of religion and the enemy of the _Sh_ah.\" His majesty the _Sh_ah  of Persia was much vexed, and said, \"This is a question for proofs and  arguments, and of truth or falsehood: what has it to do with enmity to the  government? Alas! how much we respected these 'ulama, who cannot even  reply to this epistle.\"    Briefly, all that was recorded in the Tablets to the Kings is being  fulfilled: if from the year A.D. 1870 we compare the events that have  occurred, we will find everything that has happened has appeared as  predicted; only a few remain which will afterward become manifested.    So also foreign peoples, and other sects who were not believers,  attributed many wonderful things to Baha'u'llah. Some believed that He was  a saint,(26) and some even wrote treatises about Him. One of them, Siyyid  Davudi, a Sunnite savant of Ba_gh_dad, wrote a short treatise in which he  related certain supernatural acts of Baha'u'llah. Even now, in all parts  of the East, there are some people who, though they do not believe in His  manifestation, nevertheless believe Him to be a saint and relate miracles  attributed to Him.    To sum up, both His antagonists and His partisans, as well as all those  who were received in the sacred spot, acknowledged and bore witness to the  greatness of Baha'u'llah. Though they did not believe in Him, still they  acknowledged His grandeur, and as soon as they entered the sacred spot,  the presence of Baha'u'llah produced such an effect on most of them that  they could not utter a word. How many times it happened that one of His  most bitter enemies would resolve within himself, \"I will say such and  such things when I reach His presence, and I will dispute and argue thus  with Him,\" but when he entered the Holy Presence, he would become amazed  and confounded, and remain speechless.    Baha'u'llah had never studied Arabic; He had not had a tutor or teacher,  nor had He entered a school. Nevertheless, the eloquence and elegance of  His blessed expositions in Arabic, as well as His Arabic writings, caused  astonishment and stupefaction to the most accomplished Arabic scholars,  and all recognized and declared that He was incomparable and unequaled.    If we carefully examine the text of the Torah, we see that the Divine  Manifestation never said to those who denied Him, \"Whatever miracle you  desire, I am ready to perform, and I will submit to whatever test you  propose.\" But in the Epistle to the _Sh_ah, Baha'u'llah said clearly,  \"Gather the 'ulama, and summon Me, that the evidences and proofs may be  established.\"(27)    For fifty years Baha'u'llah faced His enemies like a mountain: all wished  to annihilate Him and sought His destruction. A thousand times they  planned to crucify and destroy Him, and during these fifty years He was in  constant danger.    In this day Persia is in such a state of decadence and ruin that all  intelligent men, whether Persians or foreigners, who realize the true  state of affairs, recognize that its progress, its civilization and its  reconstruction depend upon the promulgation of the teachings and the  development of the principles of this great Personage.    Christ, in His blessed day, in reality only educated eleven men: the  greatest of them was Peter, who, nevertheless, when he was tested, thrice  denied Christ. In spite of this, the Cause of Christ subsequently  permeated the world. At the present day Baha'u'llah has educated thousands  of souls who, while under the menace of the sword, raised to the highest  heaven the cry of \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha\";(28) and in the fire of tests, their  faces became illuminated like gold. Then reflect what will take place in  the future.    Finally, we must be just and acknowledge what an Educator this Glorious  Being was, what marvelous signs were manifested by Him, and what power and  might have been realized in the world through Him.          10: TRADITIONAL PROOFS EXEMPLIFIED FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL      Today, at table, let us speak for a little of proofs. If you had come to  this blessed place in the days of the manifestation of the evident  Light,(29) if you had attained to the court of His presence, and had  witnessed His luminous beauty, you would have understood that His  teachings and perfection were not in need of further evidence.    Only through the honor of entering His presence, many souls became  confirmed believers; they had no need of other proofs. Even those people  who rejected and hated Him bitterly, when they had met Him, would testify  to the grandeur of Baha'u'llah, saying, \"This is a magnificent man, but  what a pity that he makes such a claim! Otherwise, all that he says is  acceptable.\"    But now, as that Light of Reality has set, all are in need of proofs; so  we have undertaken to demonstrate rational proofs of the truth of His  claim. We will cite another which alone is sufficient for all who are  just, and which no one can deny. It is that this illustrious Being  uplifted His Cause in the \"Greatest Prison\";(30) from this Prison His  light was shed abroad, His fame conquered the world, and the proclamation  of His glory reached the East and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#6)"],[1,"more.    SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! there's no judging by her looks, unless one was to see  her Face.    LADY SNEERWELL. Well--well--if she does take some pains to repair the  ravages of Time--you must allow she effects it with great ingenuity--and  surely that's better than the careless manner in which the widow Ocre  chaulks her wrinkles.    SIR BENJAMIN. Nay now--you are severe upon the widow--come--come, it  isn't that she paints so ill--but when she has finished her Face she  joins it on so badly to her Neck, that she looks like a mended Statue,  in which the Connoisseur sees at once that the Head's modern tho' the  Trunk's antique----    CRABTREE. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Nephew!    MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh but I vow I hate you  for it--what do you think of Miss Simper?    SIR BENJAMIN. Why, she has very pretty Teeth.    LADY TEAZLE. Yes and on that account, when she is neither speaking nor  laughing (which very seldom happens)--she never absolutely shuts her  mouth, but leaves it always on a-Jar, as it were----    MRS. CANDOUR. How can you be so ill-natured!    LADY TEAZLE. Nay, I allow even that's better than the Pains Mrs. Prim  takes to conceal her losses in Front--she draws her mouth till it  resembles the aperture of a Poor's-Box, and all her words appear to  slide out edgewise.    LADY SNEERWELL. Very well Lady Teazle I see you can be a little severe.    LADY TEAZLE. In defence of a Friend it is but justice, but here comes  Sir Peter to spoil our Pleasantry.         Enter SIR PETER    SIR PETER. Ladies, your obedient--Mercy on me--here is the whole set! a  character's dead at every word, I suppose.    MRS. CANDOUR. I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter--they have been so  censorious and Lady Teazle as bad as any one.    SIR PETER. That must be very distressing to you, Mrs. Candour I dare  swear.    MRS. CANDOUR. O they will allow good Qualities to nobody--not even good  nature to our Friend Mrs. Pursy.    LADY TEAZLE. What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs. Codrille's  [Quadrille's] last Night?    LADY SNEERWELL. Nay--her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such  Pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her.    MRS. CANDOUR. 'Tis very true, indeed.    LADY TEAZLE. Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and small whey--laces  herself by pulleys and often in the hottest noon of summer you may  see her on a little squat Pony, with her hair plaited up behind like a  Drummer's and puffing round the Ring on a full trot.    MRS. CANDOUR. I thank you Lady Teazle for defending her.    SIR PETER. Yes, a good Defence, truly!    MRS. CANDOUR. But for Sir Benjamin, He is as censorious as Miss Sallow.    CRABTREE. Yes and she is a curious Being to pretend to be censorious--an  awkward Gawky, without any one good Point under Heaven!    LADY SNEERWELL. Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss  Sallow is a Relation of mine by marriage, and, as for her Person great  allowance is to be made--for, let me tell you a woman labours under many  disadvantages who tries to pass for a girl at six-and-thirty.    MRS. CANDOUR. Tho', surely she is handsome still--and for the weakness  in her eyes considering how much she reads by candle-light it is not to  be wonder'd at.    LADY SNEERWELL. True and then as to her manner--upon my word I think  it is particularly graceful considering she never had the least  Education[:] for you know her Mother was a Welch milliner, and her  Father a sugar-Baker at Bristow.--    SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!    SIR PETER. Yes, damned good-natured! Her own relation! mercy on me!  [Aside.]    MRS. CANDOUR. For my Part I own I cannot bear to hear a friend  ill-spoken of?    SIR PETER. No, to be sure!    SIR BENJAMIN. Ah you are of a moral turn Mrs. Candour and can sit for an  hour to hear Lady Stucco talk sentiments.    LADY SNEERWELL. Nay I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the Dessert  after Dinner for she's just like the Spanish Fruit one cracks for  mottoes--made up of Paint and Proverb.    MRS. CANDOUR. Well, I never will join in ridiculing a Friend--and so I  constantly tell my cousin Ogle--and you all know what pretensions she  has to be critical in Beauty.    LADY TEAZLE. O to be sure she has herself the oddest countenance that  ever was seen--'tis a collection of Features from all the different  Countries of the globe.    SIR BENJAMIN. So she has indeed--an Irish Front----    CRABTREE. Caledonian Locks----    SIR BENJAMIN. Dutch Nose----    CRABTREE. Austrian Lips----    SIR BENJAMIN. Complexion of a Spaniard----    CRABTREE. And Teeth a la Chinoise----    SIR BENJAMIN. In short, her Face resembles a table d'hote at Spa--where  no two guests are of a nation----    CRABTREE. Or a Congress at the close of a general War--wherein all the  members even to her eyes appear to have a different interest and her  Nose and Chin are the only Parties likely to join issue.    MRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha!    SIR PETER. Mercy on my Life[!] a Person they dine with twice a week!  [Aside.]    LADY SNEERWELL. Go--go--you are a couple of provoking Toads.    MRS. CANDOUR. Nay but I vow you shall not carry the Laugh off so--for  give me leave to say, that Mrs. Ogle----    SIR PETER. Madam--madam--I beg your Pardon--there's no stopping these  good Gentlemen's Tongues--but when I tell you Mrs. Candour that the Lady  they are abusing is a particular Friend of mine, I hope you'll not take  her Part.    LADY SNEERWELL. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter--but you are a cruel  creature--too Phlegmatic yourself for a jest and too peevish to allow  wit in others.    SIR PETER. Ah Madam true wit is more nearly allow'd [allied?] to good  Nature than your Ladyship is aware of.    LADY SNEERWELL. True Sir Peter--I believe they are so near akin that  they can never be united.    SIR BENJAMIN. O rather Madam suppose them man and wife because one  seldom sees them together.    LADY TEAZLE. But Sir Peter is such an Enemy to Scandal I believe He  would have it put down by Parliament.    SIR PETER. 'Fore heaven! Madam, if they were to consider the Sporting  with Reputation of as much importance as poaching on manors--and pass  an Act for the Preservation of Fame--there are many would thank them for  the Bill.    LADY SNEERWELL. O Lud! Sir Peter would you deprive us of our  Privileges--    SIR PETER. Aye Madam--and then no person should be permitted to  kill characters or run down reputations, but qualified old Maids and  disappointed Widows.--    LADY SNEERWELL. Go, you monster--    MRS. CANDOUR. But sure you would not be quite so severe on those who  only report what they hear?    SIR PETER. Yes Madam, I would have Law Merchant for that too--and in all  cases of slander currency, whenever the Drawer of the Lie was not to  be found, the injured Party should have a right to come on any of the  indorsers.    CRABTREE. Well for my Part I believe there never was a Scandalous Tale  without some foundation.<3>    LADY SNEERWELL. Come Ladies shall we sit down to Cards in the next Room?         Enter SERVANT, whispers SIR PETER    SIR PETER. I'll be with them directly.--         [Exit SERVANT.]  I'll get away unperceived.    LADY SNEERWELL. Sir Peter you are not leaving us?    SIR PETER. Your Ladyship must excuse me--I'm called away by particular  Business--but I leave my Character behind me--         [Exit.]    SIR BENJAMIN. Well certainly Lady Teazle that lord of yours is a  strange being--I could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh  heartily if He wern't your Husband.    LADY TEAZLE. O pray don't mind that--come do let's hear 'em.         [join the rest of the Company going into the Next Room.]    SURFACE. Maria I see you have no satisfaction in this society.    MARIA. How is it possible I should? If to raise malicious smiles at the  infirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be  the province of wit or Humour, Heaven grant me a double Portion of  Dullness--    SURFACE. Yet they appear more ill-natured than they are--they have no  malice at heart--    MARIA. Then is their conduct still more contemptible[;] for in my  opinion--nothing could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a  natural and ungovernable bitterness of Mind.    SURFACE. Undoubtedly Madam--and it has always been a sentiment of  mine--that to propagate a malicious Truth wantonly--is more despicable  than to falsify from Revenge, but can you Maria feel thus [f]or others  and be unkind to me alone--nay is hope to be denied the tenderest  Passion.--    MARIA. Why will you distress me by renewing this subject--    SURFACE. Ah! Maria! you would not treat me thus and oppose your  guardian's Sir Peter's wishes--but that I see that my Profligate Brother  is still a favour'd Rival.    MARIA. Ungenerously urged--but whatever my sentiments of that  unfortunate young man are, be assured I shall not feel more bound to  give him up because his Distresses have sunk him so low as to deprive  him of the regard even of a Brother.    SURFACE. Nay but Maria do not leave me with a Frown--by all that's  honest, I swear----Gad's Life here's Lady Teazle--you must not--no you  shall--for tho' I have the greatest Regard for Lady Teazle----    MARIA. Lady Teazle!    SURFACE. Yet were Sir Peter to suspect----         [Enter LADY TEAZLE, and comes forward]    LADY TEAZLE. What's this, Pray--do you take her for me!--Child you are  wanted in the next Room.--What's all this, pray--    SURFACE. O the most unlucky circumstance in Nature. Maria has somehow  suspected the tender concern I have for your happiness, and threaten'd  to acquaint Sir Peter with her suspicions--and I was just endeavouring  to reason with her when you came.    LADY TEAZLE. Indeed but you seem'd to adopt--a very tender mode of  reasoning--do you usually argue on your knees?    SURFACE. O she's a Child--and I thought a little Bombast----but Lady  Teazle when are you to give me your judgment on my Library as you  promised----    LADY"]]]
