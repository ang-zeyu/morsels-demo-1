One Sabbath afternoon I went out of the suburb  with a few girls, who, like myself, had the spirit of adventure. As we  went along chatting merrily together, we felt ourselves caught from  behind by some Turks. Fortunately we had not got far, so that when we  shrieked out our cries were heard in the town, and to our great relief  we soon heard a horse galloping in our direction. We kept on screaming,  and one Turk put his hand over my friend's mouth; but she bit and  scratched his hand. Then, suddenly, we were let loose, and the Turks  took to their heels, for they saw Europeans galloping up to us. Two of  them jumped off their horses and asked if we were hurt, for we had been  so frightened that we could not quickly leave off crying. They kindly  brought us home, and after that experience I never wanted to go out  without enough men in our party to guard us.    \"Now this Lag B'Omer a number of girls wanted to go to see some special  places, so we formed ourselves into a large party and started very  early, for you rarely get such an outing. It was a most glorious spring  morning, and a few of us had donkeys to ride. To do so is not as much  pleasure as you might think, for the donkeys in Palestine stop every few  minutes, and, unless you beat them cruelly, which we did not like doing,  they will not budge an inch. Sometimes they consent to be led, but they  will not be driven, and you have a weary time of it. Now and then a  donkey will suddenly start off on a quick trot, and, being thus taken  unawares, the rider often falls off. You can imagine the laughter of  your friends and how stupid the girl feels, but somehow it is always  taken in good part.    \"Our visit first was to David's Tomb, but we were not allowed to go in.  Next we walked round the walls of Jerusalem, climbed up the Mount of  Olives, then rested under the shade of a large olive-tree, where we  spread out our table-cloth and arranged on it all the good things we had  brought with us. The long walk had given us good appetites. After we had  finished our meals, other groups of friends came close to us, and then  some of the men in turns told us tales of our nation's ancient glory,  and each one had something interesting to relate. Then a middle-aged man  with a group of boys came near us. I think he must have been a teacher,  for he started telling the boys about Bar Cochba and his struggle with  the Romans.    \"'Fierce struggles for Jewish freedom went on for three years, and the  Jews were proving so successful under the leadership of Bar Cochba that  the Romans thought it necessary to bring their greatest general, Julius  Severus, from Britain to command the Roman Army in Palestine. At last  the Samaritans betrayed our people: our last remaining fortified city,  Bethar, fell, and Bar Cochba died in defending it on 9th of Ab, 135 C.E.    \"'The Jews were the last people under Roman rule in those days to fight  for freedom, and over half-a-million of them lost their lives in this  long struggle. Rabbi Akiba, the wise and dearly-loved Jewish scholar,  was taken prisoner and scourged, until he expired under his sufferings.  Jerusalem was turned into a Roman colony called Aelia Capitolina, and no  Jew dared appear in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, under penalty of  death. Jews under the Roman rules were forbidden to practise their  religion, and anyone found teaching or preaching Judaism was horribly  tortured.'    \"The Rabbi, continuing, reminded his boys that, in remembrance of the  brave deeds of Bar Cochba and his Jewish soldiers, Jewish boys to this  present time play with bows and arrows on Lag B'Omer.    \"I was most interested to hear all the Rabbi had to tell his boys, and  glad to feel I was at last living in the Holy Land where so many of our  noble heroes of past ages lived and fought and suffered martyrdom. I  could not prevent tears coming to my eyes when thinking on our nation's  past glory and praying silently we may come again into our own; but I  believe it will not be so much by the power of the sword, but as the  Prophet Zachariah foretold unto Zerubbabel: 'Not by might, nor by power  (or arms), but by MY SPIRIT, saith the Lord.' Those who have been born  here or lived here for many years cannot understand our feeling thus,  though they love their country and their nation dearly.    \"When the Rabbi had ended, we all stood up and received his blessing. We  then went on to the grave of Rabbi Shiman, which was in a beautiful,  cool, and shady spot. There we found numbers of people. Some groups were  having a lively time singing and clapping their hands, while the men  were dancing; but none of the women or girls danced, as it would be  thought immodest of them, but they helped by singing and clapping their  hands. Then other folks came to pray at the saint's grave for the health  of some of their children that were ailing. Others dropped letters or  pieces of paper into the Rabbi's tomb with special requests written on  them. Some put money into the charity-boxes hanging at different parts  around the tomb. There was also no end of beggars there. One  nice-looking man went about with a red handkerchief tied up by the four  corners, asking people to put in as much as they could spare to uphold  the yeshibas and the hospital or the home for the aged, and other  institutions. But as most of the people there around the Rabbi's grave  lived on charity, I could not see what they could spare.    \"I happened to mention this to Father and said how I disliked seeing  people living on Chalukha (alms sent them from Europe), and I could not  understand why they were not ashamed to take it, for they did not look  like ordinary beggars, but quite the reverse--independent, studious,  and refined-looking, as I found out later when I spoke to them. They  seemed indeed to think they were conferring a favour by accepting alms.  Father said to a certain degree they were wrong, but from another point  of view it is difficult for a man to progress in business and at the  same time devote many hours to the study of the Torah. Our ancient  Rabbis realized this, and said that those who had not the leisure or the  inclination to devote much time to the study of the Torah should make it  their duty to give of their means towards the up-keep of those who did.  If they did this God would bless them. So it is now a recognized duty  for every Jew in Europe who has any respect for the Torah and other  religious learning or teaching to send his 'bit' towards the yearly  support of the scholars here.    \"The latter, who do nothing but study the Torah, think that it is  through their efforts in this direction that Israel is saved. They do  not consider the money given for their support a charity, but believe  they hold a similar position in Palestine to that of professors and  students who hold scholarships in the various universities in Great  Britain and Europe. The Jews in certain countries send more money for  the support of their fellow-countrymen who are teachers and scholars  than the Jews of some of the Eastern European countries, and that is why  some appear to be better off than many of their fellow-teachers and  scholars.    \"This chat with Father helped me to understand other things as well  which had puzzled me before. About this I will write more in another  letter.    \"Now I must return to Lag B'Omer, and tell you what struck me as very  strange on that day. As I went with a few of my girl-friends from group  to group to see and hear all I could about what was going on, we came to  a group of women, girls, and youngsters, and in the centre of them all a  lovely little child about three years of age sitting dressed in silk,  and a plate near by with some lovely black curls lying on it. I, of  course, asked what it all meant, and was told that those people who had  only one boy, or who had lost some by death, never cut the hair of their  children till they were between three and four years of age. Then, when  it was cut, they put all they had cut off upon a scale, and upon the  other side of the scale copper, silver, or gold money, according to  their means. If poor, they put copper coins upon the scales to test the  weight of the hair, and then distributed these copper coins among the  poor. In fact, it just looks as if those who receive charity take it  in one hand and distribute it with the other.    [Illustration: YEUSHIVA (TALMUDICAL SCHOOL)]    \"Nowhere have I ever seen so much almsgiving as here. Alms-boxes are  hung up in various places, where in Europe you would see only ornaments.  For every joy or blessing and for those who have relatives or friends  ill or in danger, money is freely dropped into the box. This money is  given towards the up-keep of the hospital for the very poor, and so on.  Really, it must be very hard for those people who have little to spare,  but Father says this is one of the means by which every Jew in Palestine  is trained to love his neighbour as himself. I feel he is right, for I  never saw so much kindness and thoughtfulness for others as I have seen  since we arrived here. Everyone naturally does what the others do, and  it has proved to me how true it is that example is far more powerful  than preaching or teaching.    \"As we appeared so interested in what they told us, they kindly invited  us to sit down and offered us wine, cake, delicious pasties, and jams,  and later on baked nuts, though we were quite strangers to them. It is  this kindliness that surprised me so much. Altogether we spent a very  joyful day, returning home by moonlight, when we girls and women  thoroughly enjoyed listening to the groups of men and boys who sang and  danced on the way home.    \"I don't think I could ever make you realize all the drawbacks to the  life here; but yet it has a very pleasant and happy side too, and you  really see far more pleasure than you ever do in London.

When this is understood we can  reasonably reduce the extension of the ancient glaciers, the lowering  of the temperature at the quaternary age, and account for the  uninterrupted life of the fauna and flora. However, we must not fall  into the opposite excess and assert, as some have done, that the  glacial period is comparatively recent, the traces of which are too  plain and fresh in some localities to assign to it an age prior to  man, and that the temperature has rather lowered itself since this  epoch. The ancient extension of the glaciers has been followed by a  corresponding growth and extension of animal life, thus proving that  the permanence of glaciers is a wise provision and absolutely  essential to man and the high orders of animals and vegetation. The  ancient extension does not prove alone that it was much colder than in  historic times, for the animals themselves are proof of this. At that  time the plains of Europe, and of France in particular, were animated  by herds of reindeer, gluttons, camels, and marmots, which one does  not find to-day except in the higher latitudes or more considerable  heights. The mammoth and rhinoceros are no exception to this, for  naturalists know they were organized to live in cold countries.    Space will not permit us to pursue this point further, or speculate on  the probable climatic conditions of the ice age; but we can carry  ourselves back a few thousand years and describe the climate of Europe  and neighboring countries of Africa and Asia. Herodotus describes the  climate of Scythia in terms which would indicate in our day the  countries of Lapland and Greenland. He shows us the country completely  frozen during eight months of the year; the Black Sea frozen up so  that it bore the heaviest loads; the region of the Danube buried under  snow for eight months, and watered in summer by the abundant rains  which gave to the river its violent course. The historian adds that  the ass cannot live in Scythia on account of the extreme cold which  reigns there. The following century Aristotle makes the same remarks  concerning Gaul. His contemporary, Theophrastes, tells us that the  olive tree did not succeed in Greece more than five hundred furlongs  from the sea. We can assure ourselves that both the ass and the olive  thrive in these countries at the present day.    Three centuries later, Caesar speaks frequently and emphatically of the  rigor of winters and early setting in of cold in France, the abundance  of snow and rain, and the number of lakes and marshes which became  every moment serious obstacles to the army. He says he is careful not  to undertake any expedition except in summer. Cicero, Varro,  Possidonius, and Strabo insist equally on the rigor of the climate of  Gaul, which allows neither the culture of the vine nor the olive.  Diodorus of Sicily confirms this information: \"The cold of the winters  in Gaul is such that almost all the rivers freeze up and form natural  bridges, over which numerous armies pass quite safely with teams and  baggages; in order to hinder the passengers to slip out upon the ice  and to render the marching more secure, they spread straw thereon.\"    Virgil and Ovid insist on the severity of cold in the regions of the  Danube. The first describes the inhabitants of these miserable  countries withdrawing themselves into caves dressed with the skins of  wild beasts. Ovid, who had passed several years of his life in that  region, is more precise in his description. He says the wine has  changed itself here (Black Sea) into a solid frozen mass; one gives it  to drink by pieces. Fearing of being accused of poetic exaggeration he  appeals to the testimony of two ancient governors of Moesia, who could  establish the facts like himself. The author who would give such  accounts of the Black Sea in our days would risk his reputation for  veracity.    Italy, too, experienced its part of the cold in early days. Virgil  tells us of the snows being, heaped up, rivers which carried ice  along, the sad winter which split the stone and bound up the course of  large streams, and all this in the warmest part of Italy, at the base  of the walls of Taranto. Heratius affirms that the Soracte, a  neighboring mountain of Rome, was whitened with thick snow, rivers  frozen, and the country covered with snow. To-day the snow stays very  little upon the Soracte and never in the country around Rome. During  the four or five centuries which followed, writers speak of the  severity of climate in Northern Italy, the lagoons on the Adriatic  being frozen over. Algiers was much colder then than now. The Danube,  Rhine, and other rivers in Europe, the Nile in Africa, the Amazon in  South America, the Mississippi and Missouri in North America, had  quite different volumes two thousand years ago than their present  actual ones, and they especially rolled much greater masses of water.    There is everything to show a modification of climate in our own days.  If this goes on in the future as in the past, there will be a marked  difference in the temperature two or three hundred years from now.  Even a degree in a thousand years would effect a great change in the  course of time. The lowering of four degrees established the ancient  extension of glaciers, though it did not interrupt animal or vegetable  life. Fifty-four of the fifty-seven species of _Mollusca_ have  outlived the glacial age, and all our savage animals--even a certain  number which have disappeared--date equally from the quaternary, and  were contemporary with the great extension of the glaciers.--_Popular  Science News_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA.      Before the year 1883 physical geographers, in speaking of the most  disastrous volcanic eruption on record, referred first, in point of  time, to the celebrated eruption of Vesuvius, in A.D. 79, when the  cities of Herculaneum, Pompeii and several smaller towns on the slope  of the mountain were destroyed by lava or buried under a mass of  pumice stones and ashes; second to that of Hecla and Skaptar Jokull,  contiguous mountains in Iceland, in 1783, when two enormous lava  streams, one 15 miles wide and over 100 ft. deep and the other  scarcely inferior, flowed, the first, 50 miles and the other 40, till  they reached the sea, pouring a flood of white hot lava into the  ocean, destroying everything in their paths and killing in the waters  of the ocean the fish, the mainstay of the inhabitants, who were  reduced by the disaster, directly or indirectly, to less than  five-sixths of their former strength; and third to that of Galungung,  in 1822, which devastated such an immense area in Java; but all the  eruptions known besides were as mere child's play to the terrible one  of Krakatoa in 1883.    If the reader will examine the map of the East Indies he will find  represented in the straits of Sunda, which lie between Sumatra and  Java, the little island of Krakatoa. In maps made before 1883 he will  hunt in vain for the name, for like Bull Run before 1861, it was then  unknown to fame, though navigators who passed through the straits knew  it as a beautiful tropical isle, with an extinct volcanic cone in the  center. In the beginning of 1883, however, the little well behaved  island showed symptoms of wrath that boded no good to the larger  islands in the vicinity. Noted for the fine fruits with which it  abounded, it was a famous picnic ground for towns and cities even 100  miles away, and when the subterranean rumblings and mutterings of  wrath became conspicuous the people of the capital of Java, Batavia,  put a steamboat into requisition and visited the island in large  numbers. For a time the island was constantly in a slight tremor, and  the subterranean roar was like the continued but distant mutterings of  thunder, but the crisis was reached August 23, at 10 o'clock A.M. It  was a beautiful Sunday morning and the waters of the straits of Sunda  were like that sea of glass, as clear as crystal, of which John in his  apocalyptic vision speaks. The beauty that morning was enhanced by the  extraordinary transparency of the tropical air, for distant mountain  ranges seemed so near that it seemed possible to strike them with a  stone cast from the hand. Only the mysterious rumblings and mutterings  of the pent up forces beneath the island disturbed the breathless calm  and silence that lay on nature--the calm before the terrible  storm--the mightiest, the most awful on record! It burst forth! Sudden  night snatched away day from the eyes of the terrified beholders on  the mainland, but the vivid play of lightnings around the ascending  column of dust penetrated even the deep obscurity to a distance of 80  miles. This awful darkness stretched within a circle whose diameter  was 400 miles, while more or less darkness reigned within a circle  with a diameter three times as great. Within this latter area dust  fell like snow from the sky, breaking off limbs of trees by its weight  miles distant, while in Batavia, 100 miles away from the scene of the  disaster, it fell to the depth of several inches. The explosions were  so loud as to be distinctly heard in Hindostan, 1,800 miles away, and  at Batavia the sound was like the constant roar of cannon in a field  of battle. Finally the whole island was blown to pieces, and now came  the most awful contest of nature--a battle of death between Neptune  and Vulcan; the sea poured down into the chasm millions of tons, only  to be at first converted into vapor by the millions of tons of  seething white hot lava beneath. Over the shores 30 miles away, waves  over 100 ft. high rolled with such a fury that everything, even to a  part of the bedrock, was swept away. Blocks of stone, of 50 tons  weight were carried two miles inland. On the Sumatra side of the  straits a large vessel"]]]
