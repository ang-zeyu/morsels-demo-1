The  officer who  sends us the above interesting  sketch writes: \"This cave afforded shelter  both from  rain and 'Jack Johnsons'  for several weeks to  ----, a certain  Highland regiment.  The cave consisted  of three long passages  capable of  holding a whole battalion. It had two  entrances, one of which is shown in  the sketch.

Mine-sweeping was  the first  task, and  then, on September 18, the Japanese  troops landed safely at Lao-shan Bay.  They  fought with  great valour  and suffered  considerable losses.  Their  casualties up to November  6 were given as 200 killed  and 878 wounded. In  the final  assault they  had 14  officers wounded and  426 men  killed and  wounded. The number of Germans captured was 2300.--[Photo. by C.N.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--35      [Illustration: WATCHED WITH INTEREST BY THEIR \"GALLANT JAPANESE  COMRADES\": BRITISH TROOPS LANDED TO CO-OPERATE AGAINST TSING-TAU.]    In  his telegram  to the  Japanese Minister  of War  after the  capture of  Tsing-tau, Lord Kitchener said:  \"Please accept my warmest congratulations  on the success of the operations against Tsing-tau.

The British  Army is proud  to have been associated with its  gallant Japanese comrades  in  this  enterprise.\"  The  British  force,  under  Brigadier-General  N.  Barnardiston, Commanding the Forces in North China, landed in Lao-shan Bay  on September  24. Some Indian troops  also took part in  the fighting.

The Cocos group are  a British possession,  and lie in the Indian Ocean,  south-west of Sumatra. Our second photograph  shows the \"Emden,\"  whose depredations have cost nearly two  and a quarter  millions  sterling. She  was a  light cruiser  of 3350  tons and  25 knots  speed, carrying ten  41-inch guns. Captain Karl von  Mueller, the \"Emden's\"  Captain, who  carried out his enterprises  with a fine spirit  of chivalry  and  daring  which  we  acknowledge,  was  a  native  of  Blankenburg,  in  Brunswick, and was formerly a captain in the Hansa Line. He is a prisoner,  unwounded, and keeps his sword.          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--37      [Illustration: THE DESTRUCTION OF THE \"EMDEN\" AND THE BOTTLING-UP OF THE  \"KOeNIGSBERG\": H.M.A.S. \"SYDNEY\" AND H.M.S. \"CHATHAM.\"]    H.M.S. \"Sydney\"  (No. 1)  caught the  commerce-raiding \"Emden\"  at Keeling  Cocos Island and forced a sharp action  upon her, with the result that the  German ship was  driven ashore and burnt. The \"Chatham\"  (No. 2) found the  \"Koenigsberg,\" the ship, it will be recalled, which attacked the \"Pegasus,\"  hiding in shoal  water up the Rufigi River, German  East Africa, with part  of her crew entrenched on the banks.  Unable to get at her, she bottled up  the \"Koenigsberg\"  by sinking colliers  in the only navigable  channel. The  \"Sydney\" is a light cruiser of  5600 tons, launched, as was the \"Chatham,\"  in 1911. The \"Chatham\" was practically  a sister ship of the \"Sydney,\" but  rather smaller,  displacing 5400 tons, The  \"Emden\" was of 3650  tons; the  \"Koenigsberg\" displaced 3400 tons.--[Photos. by Symonds.]          __________________________________________________________________________  38--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

This piece, though light  enough to be wheeled by two  men, throws a shell  weighing 187  lbs. The spherical  shell has a  loose stem which  is loaded  into the  bore and drops out  in flight.

The  shell is a thin-walled mine-shell  containing a large  charge and is intended to act with explosive effect, not splinter-effect.\"  The diagram on the left shows one of the shells and its stem in their most  up-to-date form; in the centre is  the trench-mortar (its wheels off) with  a shell in place; below this are  three shells without their stems; on the  right is a shell and its stem.          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--39      [Illustration: WHERE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS ARE NOT: GERMAN MACHINE-GUNS, ON  TEMPORARY MOUNTINGS, FOR USE AGAINST WAR-PLANES.]    The Germans, according to paragraphs from their newspapers reprinted here,  sneer at the  way London is guarding against hostile  aircraft by mounting  quick-firing guns and searchlights and putting out many street lamps. They  are doing much  the same themselves, however, in the  cities nearest their  western frontier. At  Cologne, ever since August, there  has been constant  nervousness  as  to possible  air-raids,  and  searchlights from  elevated  points in the city have swept  the sky nightly, and machine-guns have been  set  up on  tall  buildings. At  Duesseldorf when  our  airmen destroyed  a  Zeppelin, the  aviators were fired  at by  machine-guns from all  over the  city.  Our illustration  shows  German machine-guns  in  temporary use  as  anti-aircraft guns.--[Photo. by Photopress.]          __________________________________________________________________________  40--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

SENEGALESE ON THE DEFENSIVE AT PERVYSE.]    Among the French Colonial troops, the Senegalese have done excellent work,  both on the Aisne and, more recently, in Belgium. Our photograph was taken  near  Pervyse, a  village on  the railway  between Dixmunde  and Nieuport,  which has been the  scene of many fierce encounters. In  the Battle of the  Aisne,  when  much night  fighting  took  place,  the Senegalese,  it  was  reported, whose dark complexions rendered their faces less visible, proved  very useful, and showed extraordinary daring. A favourite ruse was to send  them forward at night, and when they had crawled near to the German lines,  to turn  powerful searchlights on  the enemy,  who, blinded by  the glare,  could not  see whence the  attack came.  The Senegalese would  then charge  with the bayonet--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--41      [Illustration: MARTIAL LAW IN EGYPT: EXAMINING PASSPORTS AT PORT SAID  SINCE TURKEY FORMALLY DECLARED WAR.]    Martial Law was officially proclaimed  by the British authorities in Egypt  on  November  2,  as  the  first and  immediate  result  of  the  outbreak  of  hostilities with  Turkey.  For  some time  before  that, however,  the  authorities had been  taking precautionary measures in  consequence of the  ubiquity and  restless activity of the  horde of German secret  agents and  spies  known  to  be  busily  at work,  seeking  to  spread  sedition  and  disaffection among  the natives. To  prevent the transmission  of military  and  other  intelligence to  Constantinople  by  their emissaries,  severe  restrictions  have had  to  be  imposed along  the  land-frontiers and  in  particular at ports such as Alexandria,  Port Said and Suez on all persons  entering  or  leaving  the  country. All  passports  and  credentials  are  subjected to a close scrutiny.--[Photo. by C.N.]          __________________________________________________________________________  42--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

It was also anticipated that the  conditions of the Christmas spent by the  Germans  at  the front  would,  like  those  experienced  by our  own  men  and  those of  the  Allied Armies,  be ameliorated  by  the reception  and  distribution  of  gifts from  home.  For  a considerable  while  Germany's  women-folk, especially,  collected gifts for  fathers and brothers  at the  front; and it is certain that their efforts were much appreciated.          __________________________________________________________________________  34--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: UNDERGROUND, WITH GRAMOPHONE, WHITE TABLE-COVER, AND  FLOWERS: FRENCH SOLDIERS IN A \"HOME-LIKE\" BOMB-PROOF TRENCH.]    Our photograph  reproduces a snapshot,  by a French artillery  officer, in  the trenches to the east of the Aisne. It shows how some of the French are  making  the best  of things,  regardless of  weather and  the enemy.  They  hollowed out the  trench at one point (describes the  officer), and roofed  it over with planks and earth, forming a bomb-proof. A seat was cut at the  sides and a table  got from a village near. A roll  of sheet-iron found in  the  village was  made a  chimney for  a fire  with a  cosy chimney-corner  beside it. With some wire, also, a sort of candelabra was constructed. The  flowers on the  table are in a  German shell for vase,  and the gramophone  was another village \"find.\" It is evident  that the war may develop a race  of military troglodytes.          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--35      [Illustration: HEADQUARTERS UNDERGROUND: THE BRAIN OF THE BRITISH ARMY  WORKING IN A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM, SAFE FROM SHELL-FIRE.]    Our illustration shows  how and why the motive-power  of the Expeditionary  Force, the brain of the Army, is  often to be found below-ground. Mr. John  Dakin, writing of this drawing, made by him from a sketch which he made at  the Front, says: \"Throughout the war, the enemy has displayed considerable  skill in  locating and shelling  any buildings selected for  occupation by  our Staff. Various methods of  countering these tactics have been devised.  On at least  one occasion, headquarters was established  in a subterranean  apartment, which was not merely bomb-proof, but a comfortable retreat from  the  weather.  Here,  by  lamplight,  plans were  worked  out;  scraps  of  information  pieced  together  with  the  aid  of  maps  without  risk  of  interruption from the enemy.\"--[_Drawn by  John Dakin from his Sketch made  on the Spot._]          __________________________________________________________________________  36--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: AFTER THE ENEMY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO COME WITHIN  POINT-BLANK RANGE OF THEIR SILENT FOE:]    Determined night-onslaughts by  infantry have been, according  to a letter  from Petrograd, a notable feature of  the German tactics in the battles on  the  Vistula, particularly  in the  fighting  that has  been taking  place  between  Lowicz and  the river.  By day,  the Germans,  we are  told, were  persistently  aggressive, continuously  launching attacks  against various  points of the Russian lines, while the Russians remained on the defensive.  With the  coming of darkness,  however, regularly, night after  night, the  Germans  redoubled  their  efforts  everywhere, taking  advantage  of  the  obscurity  to fling  forward dense  swarms and  columns of  men in  massed  formation, to  storm the  entrenched Russian  position, apparently  at any  cost. They failed every time, it would appear, beaten back after literally  a  massacre.

The Russians,  it is  stated, invariably  allowed the Germans to come in to well within point-blank range, remaining  silent, holding their fire and not showing a light meanwhile. Then, as the  enemy got within point-blank range, searchlights were suddenly switched on  and  a ceaseless  fusillade  of  Maxim and  rifle-fire  from the  Russians  literally mowed the Germans down by hundreds, breaking up their masses and  paralysing the attack.

No. 1 is  McDougal's Armoured Whale-back,  with  conning-towers, a  design  of 1892  for  converting whalebacks  into  war-vessels.  No. 2  is an  American  design of  1892, Commodore  Folger's  Dynamite Ram, cigar-shaped,  with two guns throwing masses  of dynamite or  aerial torpedoes. No. 3 is a design by the Earl of Mayo in 1894 and called  \"Aries the  Ram,\" built round  an immense beam  of steel terminating  in a  sharp point, No. 4 is Gathmann's boat for a heavy gun forward, designed in  1900. She was to  be of great speed, and the forward gun  was to throw 600  lb. of gun-cotton at the rate of 2000 feet per second. A formidable Armada  this, had it been practicable.          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--39      [Illustration: SHIPS THE BRITISH, AND THE GERMAN, NAVY MIGHT HAVE HAD!  DESIGNS BY THE KAISER AND OTHER NAVAL THEORISTS.]    The first illustration on this page is  a design for a battle-ship made by  the Kaiser in 1893,  to replace the old \"Preussen,\" then  out of date. The  vessel  was  to  carry  four  large barbettes  and  a  huge  umbrella-like  fighting-top. Illustration No. 2 is  an Immersible Ironclad, designed by a  French engineer named  Le Grand, in 1862.  In action the vessel  was to be  partly  submerged, so  that only  her  three turrets  and the  top of  the  armoured glacis  would be visible.  No. 3  is Admiral Elliott's  \"Ram,\" of  1884.  The  ship was  to  carry  a  \"crinoline\"  of stanchions  along  her  water-line, practically  a fixed  torpedo-net. No.  4 is  Thomas Cornish's  Invulnerable  Ironclad, of  1885. She  was to  have two  separate parallel  hulls under water; above she was of turtle-back shape.          __________________________________________________________________________  40--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: EXPERTS IN CLOSE-QUARTER FIGHTING: SIBERIAN INFANTRYMEN  IN THEIR FIELD-SERVICE EQUIPMENT AT WARSAW.]    Our illustration shows  a halt in one  of the squares of Warsaw  of one of  the regiments  of Siberian infantry, whose  magnificent fighting qualities  in all  the battles  of the war  in the eastern  theatre of  operations in  which they have  taken part have gained  for them, as the  accounts of the  different actions  sent to  London from  Petrograd testify,  the outspoken  admiration of the whole Russian  Army. Particularly singled out for praise  has been their audacious expertness  in close-quarter combats. They supply  both infantry and  artillery, and are recruited all  over Siberia, forming  ordinarily two separate commands, the  East Siberian and the West Siberian  troops, which garrison the  fortresses and districts between Vladisvostock  and the  Ural Mountains, the  dividing range between European  and Asiatic  Russia.          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--41      [Illustration: THE LETTER HOME: A BRITISH SOLDIER WRITING IN A LOFT OVER  A COW-SHED \"SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FRONT.\"]    One  of the  happiest features  of  the Great  War,  and one  of its  most  favourable omens, is  the optimistic spirit in which  our troops, officers  and men  alike, are  making the  best of  things, in  spite of  the trying  conditions in  which they have to  live and carry out  their arduous work.
