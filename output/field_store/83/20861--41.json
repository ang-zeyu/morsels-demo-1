Ah! how I thought of her as that cruel day's most cruel sun climbed  higher and higher in the flawless flaming vault. A pocket-handkerchief  of all things had remained in my trousers pocket through fire and water;  I knotted it on the old childish plan, and kept it ever drenched upon  the head that had its own fever to endure as well. Eva Denison! Eva  Denison! I was talking to her in the past, I was talking to her in the  future, and oh! how different were the words, the tone! Yes, I hated  myself for having forgotten her; but I hated God for having given her  back to my tortured brain; it made life so many thousandfold more sweet,  and death so many thousandfold more bitter.    She was saved in the gig. Sweet Jesus, thanks for that! But I--I was  dying a lingering death in mid-ocean; she would never know how I loved  her, I, who could only lecture her when I had her at my side.    Dying? No--no--not yet! I must live--live--live--to tell my darling how  I had loved her all the time. So I forced myself from my lethargy of  despair and grief; and this thought, the sweetest thought of all my  life, may or may not have been my unrealized stimulus ere now; it was in  very deed my most conscious and perpetual spur henceforth until the end.    From this onward, while my sense stood by me, I was practical,  resourceful, alert. It was now high-noon, and I had eaten nothing since  dinner the night before. How clearly I saw the long saloon table, only  laid, however, abaft the mast; the glittering glass, the cool white  napery, the poor old dried dessert in the green dishes! Earlier, this  had occupied my mind an hour; now I dismissed it in a moment; there was  Eva, I must live for her; there must be ways of living at least a day or  two without sustenance, and I must think of them.    So I undid that belt of mine which fastened me to my gridiron, and I  straddled my craft with a sudden keen eye for sharks, of which I never  once had thought until now. Then I tightened the belt about my hollow  body, and just sat there with the problem. The past hour I had been  wholly unobservant; the inner eye had had its turn; but that was over  now, and I sat as upright as possible, seeking greedily for a sail. Of  course I saw none. Had we indeed been off our course before the fire  broke out? Had we burned to cinders aside and apart from the regular  track of ships? Then, though my present valiant mood might ignore  the adverse chances, they were as one hundred to a single chance of  deliverance. Our burning had brought no ship to our succor; and how  should I, a mere speck amid the waves, bring one to mine?    Moreover, I was all but motionless; I was barely drifting at all. This  I saw from a few objects which were floating around me now at noon; they  had been with me when the high sun rose. One was, I think, the very  oar which had been my first support; another was a sailor's cap; but  another, which floated nearer, was new to me, as though it had come to  the surface while my eyes were turned inwards. And this was clearly the  case; for the thing was a drowned and bloated corpse.    It fascinated me, though not with extraordinary horror; it came too late  to do that. I thought I recognized the man's back. I fancied it was  the mate who had taken charge of the long-boat. Was I then the single  survivor of those thirty souls? I was still watching my poor lost  comrade, when that happened to him against which even I was not proof.  Through the deep translucent blue beneath me a slim shape glided; three  smaller fish led the way; they dallied an instant a fathom under my  feet, which were snatched up, with what haste you may imagine; then on  they went to surer prey.    He turned over; his dreadful face stared upwards; it was the chief  officer, sure enough. Then he clove the water with a rush, his dead hand  waved, the last of him to disappear; and I had a new horror to think  over for my sins. His poor fingers were all broken and beaten to a pulp.    The voices of the night came back to me--the curses and the cries. Yes,  I must have heard them. In memory now I recognized the voice of the  chief mate, but there again came in the assisted imagination. Yet I  was not so sure of this as before. I thought of Santos and his horrible  heavy cane. Good God! she was in the power of that! I must live for Eva  indeed; must save myself to save and protect my innocent and helpless  girl.    Again I was a man; stronger than ever was the stimulus now, louder than  ever the call on every drop of true man's blood in my perishing frame.  It should not perish! It should not!    Yet my throat was parched; my lips were caked; my frame was hollow. Very  weak I was already; without sustenance I should surely die. But as yet  I was far enough from death, or I had done disdaining the means of life  that all this time lay ready to my hand. A number of dead fowls imparted  ballast to my little craft.    Yet I could not look at them in all these hours; or I could look, but  that was all. So I must sit up one hour more, and keep a sharper eye  than ever for the tiniest glimmer of a sail. To what end, I often asked  myself? I might see them; they would never see me.    Then my eyes would fail, and \"you squeamish fool!\" I said at intervals,  until my tongue failed to articulate; it had swollen so in my mouth.  Flying fish skimmed the water like thick spray; petrels were so few that  I could count them; another shark swam round me for an hour. In sudden  panic I dashed my knuckles on the wooden bars, to get at a duck to give  the monster for a sop. My knuckles bled. I held them to my mouth. My  cleaving tongue wanted more. The duck went to the shark; a few minutes  more and I had made my own vile meal as well.          CHAPTER V. MY REWARD      The sun declined; my shadow broadened on die waters; and now I felt that  if my cockle-shell could live a little longer, why, so could I.    I had got at the fowls without further hurt. Some of the bars took out,  I discovered how. And now very carefully I got my legs in, and knelt;  but the change of posture was not worth the risk one ran for it; there  was too much danger of capsizing, and failing to free oneself before she  filled and sank.    With much caution I began breaking the bars, one by one; it was hard  enough, weak as I was; my thighs were of more service than my hands.    But at last I could sit, the grating only covering me from the knees  downwards. And the relief of that outweighed all the danger, which, as I  discovered to my untold joy, was now much less than it had been before.  I was better ballast than the fowls.    These I had attached to the lashings which had been blown asunder by the  explosion; at one end of the coop the ring-bolt had been torn clean out,  but at the other it was the cordage that had parted. To the frayed  ends I tied my fowls by the legs, with the most foolish pride in my own  cunning. Do you not see? It would keep them fresh for my use, and it was  a trick I had read of in no book; it was all my own.    So evening fell and found me hopeful and even puffed up; but yet, no  sail.    Now, however, I could lie back, and use had given me a strange sense of  safety; besides, I think I knew, I hope I felt, that the hen-coop was in  other Hands than mine.    All is reaction in the heart of man; light follows darkness nowhere more  surely than in that hidden self, and now at sunset it was my heart's  high-noon. Deep peace pervaded me as I lay outstretched in my narrow  rocking bed, as it might be in my coffin; a trust in my Maker's will  to save me if that were for the best, a trust in His final wisdom and  loving-kindness, even though this night should be my last on earth. For  myself I was resigned, and for others I must trust Him no less. Who was  I to constitute myself the protector of the helpless, when He was in  His Heaven? Such was my sunset mood; it lasted a few minutes, and then,  without radically changing, it became more objective.    The west was a broadening blaze of yellow and purple and red. I cannot  describe it to you. If you have seen the sun set in the tropics, you  would despise my description; and, if not, I for one could never make  you see it. Suffice it that a petrel wheeled somewhere between deepening  carmine and paling blue, and it took my thoughts off at an earthy  tangent. I thanked God there were no big sea-birds in these latitudes;  no molly-hawks, no albatrosses, no Cape-hens. I thought of an albatross  that I had caught going out. Its beak and talons were at the bottom  with the charred remains of the Lady Jermyn. But I could see them  still, could feel them shrewdly in my mind's flesh; and so to the old  superstition, strangely justified by my case; and so to the poem which  I, with my special experience, not unnaturally consider the greatest  poem ever penned.    But I did not know it then as I do now--and how the lines eluded me! I  seemed to see them in the book, yet I could not read the words!                 \"Water, water, everywhere,                Nor any drop to drink.\"    That, of course, came first (incorrectly); and it reminded me of my  thirst, which the blood of the fowls had so very partially appeased. I  see now that it is lucky I could recall but little more. Experience is  less terrible than realization, and that poem makes me realize what I  went through as memory cannot. It has verses which would have driven me  mad. On the other hand, the exhaustive mental search for them distracted  my thoughts until the stars were back in the sky; and now I had a new  occupation, saying to myself all the poetry I could remember, especially  that of the sea; for I was a bookish fellow even then. But I never  was anything of a scholar. It is odd therefore, that the one apposite  passage which recurred to me in its entirety was in hexameters and  pentameters:       Me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"upon a time, and a very good time too, though it was not in my  time, nor your time, nor for the matter of that in any one's time, there  lived a man and a woman who had one son called Jack, and he was just  terribly fond of reading books. He read, and he read, and then, because  his parents lived in a lonely house in a lonely forest and he never saw  any other folk but his father and his mother, he became quite crazy to  go out into the world and see charming princesses and the like.    So one day he told his mother he must be off, and she called him an  air-brained addle-pate, but added that, as he was no use at home, he had  better go seek his fortune. Then she asked him if he would rather take a  small cake with her blessing to eat on his journey, or a large cake with  her curse? Now Jack was a very hungry lad, so he just up and said:    \"A big cake, if you please, 'm.\"    So his mother made a great big cake, and when he started she just off to  the top of the house and cast malisons on him, till he got out of  sight. You see she had to do it, but after that she sate down and cried.    Well, Jack hadn't gone far till he came to a field where his father was  ploughing. Now the goodman was dreadfully put out when he found his son  was going away, and still more so when he heard he had chosen his  mother's malison. So he cast about what to do to put things straight,  and at last he drew out of his pocket a little golden snuff-box, and  gave it to the lad, saying:    \"If ever you are in danger of sudden death you may open the box; but not  till then. It has been in our family for years and years; but, as we  have lived, father and son, quietly in the forest, none of us have ever  been in need of help--perhaps you may.\"    So Jack pocketed the golden snuff-box and went on his way.    Now, after a time, he grew very tired, and very hungry, for he had eaten  his big cake first thing, and night closed in on him so that he could  scarce see his way.    But at last he came to a large house and begged board and lodging at the  back door. Now Jack was a good-looking young fellow, so the maid-servant  at once called him in to the fireside and gave him plenty good meat and  bread and beer. And it so happened that while he was eating his supper  the master's gay young daughter came into the kitchen and saw him. So  she went to her father and said that there was the prettiest young  fellow she had ever seen in the back kitchen, and that if her father  loved her he would give the young man some employment. Now the  gentleman of the house was exceedingly fond of his gay young daughter,  and did not want to vex her; so he went into the back kitchen and  questioned Jack as to what he could do.    \"Anything,\" said Jack gaily, meaning, of course, that he could do any  foolish bit of work about a house.    But the gentleman saw a way of pleasing his gay young daughter and  getting rid of the trouble of employing Jack; so he laughs and says, \"If  you can do anything, my good lad,\" says he, \"you had better do this. By  eight o'clock to-morrow morning you must have dug a lake four miles  round in front of my mansion, and on it there must be floating a whole  fleet of vessels. And they must range up in front of my mansion and fire  a salute of guns. And the very last shot must break the leg of the  four-post bed on which my daughter sleeps, for she is always late of a  morning!\"    Well! Jack was terribly flabbergasted, but he faltered out:    \"And if I don't do it?\"    \"Then,\" said the master of the house quite calmly, \"your life will be  the forfeit.\"    So he bade the servants take Jack to a turret-room and lock the door on  him.    Well! Jack sate on the side of his bed and tried to think things out,  but he felt as if he didn't know _b_ from a battledore, so he decided to  think no more, and after saying his prayers he lay down and went to  sleep. And he did sleep! When he woke it was close on eight o'clock,  and he had only time to fly to the window and look out, when the great  clock on the tower began to whirr before it struck the hour. And there  was the lawn in front of the house all set with beds of roses and stocks  and marigolds! Well! all of a sudden he remembered the little golden  snuff-box.    \"I'm near enough to death,\" quoth he to himself, as he drew it out and  opened it.    And no sooner had he opened it than out hopped three funny little red  men in red night-caps, rubbing their eyes and yawning; for, see you,  they had been locked up in the box for years, and years, and years.    \"What do you want, Master?\" they said between their yawns. But Jack  heard that clock a-whirring and knew he hadn't a moment to lose, so he  just gabbled off his orders. Then the clock began to strike, and the  little men flew out of the window, and suddenly                  Bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!    went the guns, and the last one must have broken the leg of the  four-post bed, for there at the window was the gay young daughter in her  nightcap, gazing with astonishment at the lake four miles round, with  the fleet of vessels floating on it!    And so did Jack! He had never seen such a sight in his life, and he was  quite sorry when the three little red men disturbed him by flying in at  the window and scrambling into the golden snuff-box.    \"Give us a little more time when you want us next, Master,\" they said  sulkily. Then they shut down the lid, and Jack could hear them yawning  inside as they settled down to sleep.    As you may imagine, the master of the house was fair astonished, while  as for the gay young daughter, she declared at once that she would never  marry any one else but the young man who could do such wonderful things;  the truth being that she and Jack had fallen in love with each other at  first sight.    But her father was cautious. \"It is true, my dear,\" says he, \"that the  young fellow seems a bully boy; but for aught we know it may be chance,  not skill, and he may have a broken feather in his wing. So we must try  him again.\"    Then he said to Jack, \"My daughter must have a fine house to live in.  Therefore by to-morrow morning at eight o'clock there must be a  magnificent castle standing on twelve golden pillars in the middle of  the lake, and there must be a church beside it. And all things must be  ready for the bride, and at eight o'clock precisely a peal of bells from  the church must ring out for the wedding. If not you will have to  forfeit your life.\"    This time Jack intended to give the three little red men more time for  their task; but what with having enjoyed himself so much all day, and  having eaten so much good food, he overslept himself, so that the big  clock on the tower was whirring before it struck eight when he woke,  leapt out of bed, and rushed to the golden snuff-box. But he had  forgotten where he had put it, and so the clock had _really_ begun to  strike before he found it under his pillow, opened it, and gabbled out  his orders. And then you never saw how the three little red men tumbled  over each other and yawned and stretched and made haste all at one time,  so that Jack thought his life would surely be forfeit. But just as the  clock struck its last chime, out rang a peal of merry bells, and there  was the Castle standing on twelve golden pillars and a church beside it  in the middle of the lake. And the Castle was all decorated for the  wedding, and there were crowds and crowds of servants and retainers, all  dressed in their Sunday best.    Never had Jack seen such a sight before; neither had the gay young  daughter who, of course, was looking out of the next window in her  nightcap. And she looked so pretty and so gay that Jack felt quite cross  when he had to step back to let the three little red men fly to their  golden snuff-box. But they were far crosser than he was, and mumbled and  grumbled at the hustle, so that Jack was quite glad when they shut the  box down and began to snore.    Well, of course, Jack and the gay young daughter were married, and were  as happy as the day is long; and Jack had fine clothes to wear, fine  food to eat, fine servants to wait on him, and as many fine friends as  he liked.    So he was in luck; but he had yet to learn that a mother's malison is  sure to bring misfortune some time or another.    Thus it happened that one day when he was going a-hunting with all the  ladies and gentlemen, Jack forgot to change the golden snuff-box (which  he always carried about with him for fear of accidents) from his  waistcoat pocket to that of his scarlet hunting-coat; so he left it  behind him. And what should happen but that the servant let it fall on  the ground when he was folding up the clothes, and the snuff-box flew  open and out popped the three little red men yawning and stretching.    Well! when they found out that they hadn't really been summoned, and  that there was no fear of death, they were in a towering temper and said  they had a great mind to fly away with the Castle, golden pillars and  all.    On hearing this the servant pricked up his ears.    \"Could you do that?\" he asked.    \"Could we?\" they said, and they laughed loud. \"Why, we can do anything.\"    Then the servant said ever so sharp, \"Then move me this Castle and all  it contains right away over the sea where the master can't disturb us.\"    Now the little red men need not really have obeyed the order, but they  were so cross with Jack that hardly had the servant said the words  before the task was done; so when the hunting-party came back, lo and  behold! the Castle, and the church, and the golden pillars had all  disappeared!    At first all the rest set upon Jack for being a knave and a cheat; and,  in particular, his wife's father threatened to have at him for deceiving  the gay young daughter; but at last he agreed to let Jack have twelve  months and a day to find the Castle and bring it back.    So off Jack starts on a good horse with some money in his "]]]
