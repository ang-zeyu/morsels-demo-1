The morning after I came to my  new lodging, as I was at breakfast with the gentlewoman of the house, I  heard the noise of some looms over our heads: I enquir'd what it was;  she told me a person was weaving silk.--I express'd a great desire to  see it, and ask'd if I might: She told me she would go up with me; she  was sure I should be very welcome. She was as good as her word, and as  soon as we enter'd the room, the person that was weaving look'd about,  and smiled upon us, and I loved her from that moment.--She ask'd me many  questions, and I in turn talk'd a great deal to her. I found she was a  member of Mr. Allen's Meeting, and I begun to entertain a good opinion  of her, though I was almost afraid to indulge this inclination, least  she should prove like all the rest I had met with at Portsmouth, &c. and  which had almost given me a dislike to all white women.--But after a  short acquaintance I had the happiness to find she was very different,  and quite sincere, and I was not without hope that she entertain'd some  esteem for me. We often went together to hear Dr. Gifford, and as I had  always a propensity to relieve every object in distress as far as I was  able, I used to give to all that complain'd to me; sometimes half a  guinea at a time, as I did not understand the real value of it.--This  gracious, good woman took great pains to correct and advise me in that  and many other respects.    After I had been in London about six weeks I was recommended to the  notice of some of my late Master Mr. Freelandhouse's acquaintance, who  had heard him speak frequently of me. I was much persuaded by them to go  to Holland.--My Master lived there before he bought me, and used to  speak of me so respectfully among his friends there, that it raised in  them a curiosity to see me; particularly the Gentlemen engaged in the  Ministry, who expressed a desire to hear my experience and examine me. I  found that it was my good old Master's design that I should have gone if  he had lived; for which reason I resolved upon going to Holland, and  informed my dear friend Mr. Whitefield of my intention; he was much  averse to my going at first, but after I gave him my reasons appeared  very well satisfied. I likewise informed my Betty (the good woman that I  have mentioned above) of my determination to go to Holland and I told  her that I believed she was to be my Wife: that if it was the LORD's  Will I desired it, but not else.--She made me very little answer, but  has since told me, she did not think it at that time.    I embarked at Tower-wharf at four o'clock in the morning, and arriv'd at  Amsterdam the next day by three o'clock in the afternoon. I had several  letters of recommendation to my old master's friends, who receiv'd me  very graciously. Indeed, one of the chief Ministers was particularly  good to me; he kept me at his house a long while, and took great  pleasure in asking questions, which I answer'd with delight, being  always ready to say, _\"Come unto me all ye that fear GOD, and I will  tell what he hath done for my Soul.\"_ I cannot but admire the footsteps  of Providence; astonish'd that I should be so wonderfully preserved!  Though the Grandson of a King, I have wanted bread, and should have been  glad of the hardest crust I ever saw. I who, at home, was surrounded and  guarded by slaves, so that no indifferent person might approach me, and  clothed with gold, have been inhumanly threatened with death; and  frequently wanted clothing to defend me from the inclemency of the  weather; yet I never murmured, nor was I discontented.--I am willing,  and even desirous to be counted as nothing, a stranger in the world,  and a pilgrim here; for _\"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\"_ and I'm  thankful for every trial and trouble that I've met with, as I am not  without hope that they have been all sanctified to me.    The Calvinist Ministers desired to hear my Experience from myself, which  proposal I was very well pleased with: So I stood before 38 Ministers  every Thursday for seven weeks together, and they were all very well  satisfied, and persuaded I was what I pretended to be.--They wrote down  my experience as I spoke it; and the Lord Almighty was with me at that  time in a remarkable manner, and gave me words and enabled me to answer  them; so great was his mercy to take me in hand a poor blind heathen.    At this time a very rich Merchant at Amsterdam offered to take me into  his family in the capacity of his Butler, and I very willingly accepted  it.--He was a gracious worthy Gentleman and very good to me.--He treated  me more like a friend than a servant.--I tarried there a twelvemonth but  was not thoroughly contented, I wanted to see my wife; (that is now) and  for that reason I wished to return to _England_, I wrote to her once in  my absence, but she did not answer my letter; and I must acknowledge if  she had, it would have given me a less opinion of her.--My Master and  Mistress persuaded me much not to leave them and likewise their two Sons  who entertained a good opinion of me; and if I had found my Betty  married on my arrival in England, I should have returned to them again  immediately.    My Lady purposed my marrying her maid; she was an agreeable young woman,  had saved a good deal of money, but I could not fancy her, though she  was willing to accept of me, but I told her my inclinations were engaged  in England, and I could think of no other Person.--On my return home, I  found my Betty disengaged.--She had refused several offers in my  absence, and told her sister that, she thought, if ever she married I  was to be her husband.    Soon after I came home, I waited on Doctor Gifford who took me into his  family and was exceedingly, good to me. The character of this pious  worthy Gentleman is well known; my praise can be of no use or  signification at all.--I hope I shall ever gratefully remember the many  favours I have received from him.--Soon after I came to Doctor Gifford  I expressed a desire to be admitted into their Church, and set down with  them; they told me I must first be baptized; so I gave in my experience  before the Church, with which they were very well satisfied, and I was  baptized by Doctor Gifford with some others. I then made known my  intentions of being married; but I found there were many objections  against it because the person I had fixed on was poor. She was a widow,  her husband had left her in debt, and with a child, so that they  persuaded me against it out of real regard to me.--But I had promised  and was resolved to have her; as I knew her to be a gracious woman, her  poverty was no objection to me, as they had nothing else to say against  her. When my friends found that they could not alter my opinion  respecting her, they wrote to Mr. Allen, the Minister she attended, to  persuade her to leave me; but he replied that he would not interfere at  all, that we might do as we would. I was resolved that all my wife's  little debt should be paid before we were married; so that I sold almost  every thing I had and with all the money I could raise cleared all that  she owed, and I never did any thing with a better will in all my Life,  because I firmly believed that we should be very happy together, and so  it prov'd, for she was given me from the LORD. And I have found her a  blessed partner, and we have never repented, tho' we have gone through  many great troubles and difficulties.    My wife got a very good living by weaving, and could do extremely well;  but just at that time there was great disturbance among the weavers; so  that I was afraid to let my wife work, least they should insist on my  joining the rioters which I could not think of, and, possibly, if I had  refused to do so they would have knock'd me on the head.--So that by  these means my wife could get no employ, neither had I work enough to  maintain my family. We had not yet been married a year before all these  misfortunes overtook us.    Just at this time a gentleman, that seemed much concerned for us,  advised me to go into Essex with him and promised to get me employed.--I  accepted his kind proposal, and he spoke to a friend of his, a Quaker, a  gentleman of large fortune, who resided a little way out of the town of  _Colchester_, his name was _Handbarar_; he ordered his steward to set me  to work. There were several employed in the same way with myself. I was  very thankful and contented though my wages were but small.--I was  allowed but eight pence a day, and found myself; but after I had been in  this situation for a fortnight, my Master, being told that a Black was  at work for him, had an inclination to see me. He was pleased to talk to  me for some time, and at last enquired what wages I had; when I told him  he declared, it was too little, and immediately ordered his Steward to  let me have eighteen pence a day, which he constantly gave me after; and  I then did extremely well.    I did not bring my wife with me: I came first alone and it was my  design, if things answered according to our wishes, to send for her--I  was now thinking to desire her to come to me when I receiv'd a letter to  inform me she was just brought to bed and in want of many  necessaries.--This news was a great trial to me and a fresh affliction:  but my God, _faithful and abundant in mercy_, forsook me not in this  trouble.--As I could not read _English_, I was obliged to apply to some  one to read the letter I received, relative to my wife. I was directed  by the good Providence of God to a worthy young gentleman, a Quaker, and  friend of my Master.--I desired he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"sinations, proscriptions, and a series of  horror beyond the histories perhaps of any other nation in the world;  though the histories of all nations are made up of similar matter. I  once more excuse myself in point of exactness for want of books. But I  shall estimate the slaughters in this island but at two millions; which  your lordship will find much short of the reality.    Let us pass by the wars, and the consequences of them, which wasted  Grecia-Magna, before the Roman power prevailed in that part of Italy.  They are perhaps exaggerated; therefore I shall only rate them at one  million. Let us hasten to open that great scene which establishes the  Roman empire, and forms the grand catastrophe of the ancient drama. This  empire, whilst in its infancy, began by an effusion of human blood  scarcely credible. The neighboring little states teemed for new  destruction: the Sabines, the Samnites, the AEqui, the Volsci, the  Hetrurians, were broken by a series of slaughters which had no  interruption, for some hundreds of years; slaughters which upon all  sides consumed more than two millions of the wretched people. The Gauls,  rushing into Italy about this time, added the total destruction of their  own armies to those of the ancient inhabitants. In short, it were hardly  possible to conceive a more horrid and bloody picture, if that the Punic  wars that ensued soon after did not present one that far exceeds it.  Here we find that climax of devastation, and ruin, which seemed to shake  the whole earth. The extent of this war, which vexed so many nations,  and both elements, and the havoc of the human species caused in both,  really astonishes beyond expression, when it is nakedly considered, and  those matters which are apt to divert our attention from it, the  characters, actions, and designs of the persons concerned, are not taken  into the account. These wars, I mean those called the Punic wars, could  not have stood the human race in less than three millions of the  species. And yet this forms but a part only, and a very small part, of  the havoc caused by the Roman ambition. The war with Mithridates was  very little less bloody; that prince cut off at one stroke 150,000  Romans by a massacre. In that war Sylla destroyed 300,000 men at  Cheronea. He defeated Mithridates' army under Dorilaus, and slew  300,000. This great and unfortunate prince lost another 300,000 before  Cyzicum. In the course of the war he had innumerable other losses; and  having many intervals of success, he revenged them severely. He was at  last totally overthrown; and he crushed to pieces the king of Armenia,  his ally, by the greatness of his ruin. All who had connections with him  shared the same fate. The merciless genius of Sylla had its full scope;  and the streets of Athens were not the only ones which ran with blood.  At this period, the sword, glutted with foreign slaughter, turned its  edge upon the bowels of the Roman republic itself; and presented a scene  of cruelties and treasons enough almost to obliterate the memory of all  the external devastations. I intended, my lord, to have proceeded in a  sort of method in estimating the numbers of mankind cut off in these  wars which we have on record. But I am obliged to alter my design. Such  a tragical uniformity of havoc and murder would disgust your lordship as  much as it would me; and I confess I already feel my eyes ache by  keeping them so long intent on so bloody a prospect. I shall observe  little on the Servile, the Social, the Gallic, and Spanish wars; nor  upon those with Jugurtha, nor Antiochus, nor many others equally  important, and carried on with equal fury. The butcheries of Julius  Caesar alone are calculated by somebody else; the numbers he has been the  means of destroying have been reckoned at 1,200,000. But to give your  lordship an idea that may serve as a standard, by which to measure, in  some degree, the others; you will turn your eyes on Judea; a very  inconsiderable spot of the earth in itself, though ennobled by the  singular events which had their rise in that country.    This spot happened, it matters not here by what means, to become at  several times extremely populous, and to supply men for slaughters  scarcely credible, if other well-known and well-attested ones had not  given them a color. The first settling of the Jews here was attended by  an almost entire extirpation of all the former inhabitants. Their own  civil wars, and those with their petty neighbors, consumed vast  multitudes almost every year for several centuries; and the irruptions  of the kings of Babylon and Assyria made immense ravages. Yet we have  their history but partially, in an indistinct, confused manner; so that  I shall only throw the strong point of light upon that part which  coincides with Roman history, and of that part only on the point of time  when they received the great and final stroke which made them, no more a  nation; a stroke which is allowed to have cut off little less than two  millions of that people. I say nothing of the loppings made from that  stock whilst it stood; nor from the suckers that grew out of the old  root ever since. But if, in this inconsiderable part of the globe, such  a carnage has been made in two or three short reigns, and that this  great carnage, great as it is, makes but a minute part of what the  histories of that people inform us they suffered; what shall we judge of  countries more extended, and which have waged wars by far more  considerable?    Instances of this sort compose the uniform of history. But there have  been periods when no less than universal destruction to the race of  mankind seems to have been threatened. Such was that when the Goths, the  Vandals, and the Huns, poured into Gaul, Italy, Spain, Greece, and  Africa, carrying destruction before them as they advanced, and leaving  horrid deserts every way behind them. _Vastum ubique silentium, secreti  colles; fumantia procul tecta; nemo exploratoribus obvius_, is what  Tacitus calls _facies victoriae_. It is always so; but was here  emphatically so. From the north proceeded the swarms of Goths, Vandals,  Huns, Ostrogoths, who ran towards the south, into Africa itself, which  suffered as all to the north had done. About this time, another torrent  of barbarians, animated by the same fury, and encouraged by the same  success, poured out of the south, and ravaged all to the northeast and  west, to the remotest parts of Persia on one hand, and to the banks of  the Loire or farther on the other; destroying all the proud and curious  monuments of human art, that not even the memory might seem to survive  of the former inhabitants. What has been done since, and what will  continue to be done while the same inducements to war continue, I shall  not dwell upon. I shall only in one word mention the horrid effects of  bigotry and avarice, in the conquest of Spanish America; a conquest, on  a low estimation, effected by the murder of ten millions of the species.  I shall draw to a conclusion of this part, by making a general  calculation of the whole. I think I have actually mentioned above  thirty-six millions. I have not particularized any more. I don't pretend  to exactness; therefore, for the sake of a general view, I shall lay  together all those actually slain in battles, or who have perished in a  no less miserable manner by the other destructive consequences of war  from the beginning of the world to this day, in the four parts of it, at  a thousand times as much; no exaggerated calculation, allowing for time  and extent. We have not perhaps spoke of the five-hundredth part; I am  sure I have not of what is actually ascertained in history; but how much  of these butcheries are only expressed in generals, what part of time  history has never reached, and what vast spaces of the habitable globe  it has not embraced, I need not mention to your lordship. I need not  enlarge on those torrents of silent and inglorious blood which have  glutted the thirsty sands of Afric, or discolored the polar snow, or  fed the savage forests of America for so many ages of continual war.  Shall I, to justify my calculations from the charge of extravagance, add  to the account those skirmishes which happen in all wars, without being  singly of sufficient dignity in mischief, to merit a place in history,  but which by their frequency compensate for this comparative innocence?  shall I inflame the account by those general massacres which have  devoured whole cities and nations; those wasting pestilences, those  consuming famines, and all those furies that follow in the train of war?  I have no need to exaggerate; and I have purposely avoided a parade of  eloquence on this occasion. I should despise it upon any occasion; else  in mentioning these slaughters, it is obvious how much the whole might  be heightened, by an affecting description of the horrors that attend  the wasting of kingdoms, and sacking of cities. But I do not write to  the vulgar, nor to that which only governs the vulgar, their passions. I  go upon a naked and moderate calculation, just enough, without a  pedantical exactness, to give your lordship some feeling of the effects  of political society. I charge the whole of these effects on political  society. I avow the charge, and I shall presently make it good to your  lordship's satisfaction. The numbers I particularized are about  thirty-six millions. Besides those killed in battles I have said  something, not half what the matter would have justified, but something  I have said concerning the consequences of war even more dreadful than  that monstrous carnage itself which shocks our humanity, and almost  staggers our belief. So that, allowing me in my exuberance one way for  my deficiencies in the other, you will find me not unreasonable. I  think the numbers of men now upon earth are computed at five hundred  millions at the most. Here the slaughter of mankind,"]]]
