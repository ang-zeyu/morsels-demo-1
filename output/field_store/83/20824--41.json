Complete return of  function of the member and cessation of lameness takes place within a  few weeks in the average case.    Where an infectious synovitis involves a structure such as the sheath of  the tendon of the deep digital flexor (perforans) the condition is grave  and because of the location of this theca the prognosis is not much more  favorable than in an articular synovitis.    Inflammation of bursae and thecae may be classified on a chronological  basis with propriety because the duration of such affections, in many  cases, materially modifies the result. A chronic inflammatory  involvement of a theca through which an important tendon plays may cause  adhesions to form. Or there may occur erosions of the parts with  eventual hypertrophy and loss of function, partial or complete.    However, in general practice a classification on an etiological basis  is probably more practical and we shall consider inflammation of bursae  and thecae as _infectious_ and _noninfectious_.    _Infectious_ bursitis and thecitis is usually the result of direct  introduction of septic material into the synovial structure by means of  injuries. Infection by contiguous extension occurs and also metastatic  involvement is met with occasionally.    The noninfectious inflammation of bursae and thecae usually result from  contusions or strains and generally run their course without becoming  infective in character, where vitality and resistance of the subject are  normal.    In a general way, inflammation and other affections of bursae and thecae  are considered very similar to like affections of joints.      AFFECTIONS OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS.    Muscles and tendons having to do with locomotion are more frequently  injured than are any of the other structures whose function is to propel  the body or sustain weight. This is due in part to the exposed position  of muscles and tendons. They serve as a protection to the underlying  structures and in this manner receive many blows the force and violence  of which are spent before injury extends beyond these tissues.    Muscles of the breast, shoulder and rump are most frequently the  recipient of injuries of various kinds. The abductors of the thigh are  subjected to bruising when horses are thrown astride of wagon poles or  similar objects. Thus in one way or another muscle injuries are  occasioned and cause lameness.    Traumatic affection of muscles of locomotion may be surface or  subsurface--subsurface with little injury done the skin and fascia, but  with subsurface extravasation of blood and masceration of tissue.  Puncture wounds wherein the vulnerant body is of small diameter, are  observed, and they occasion deep seated infectious inflammation of the  parts affected, with surface wounds that are often unnoticeable. Such  injuries--puncture wounds--are always serious, and because of the fact  that, there exists little evidence of injury at the time of their  infliction, treatment is usually deferred several days and often  infection has become quite extensive when the practitioner is consulted.    Where infective wounds of muscles of locomotion occur, the course and  gravity of the affection are directly influenced by the proximity of the  injury to lymph plexuses. For instance, injuries causing an infectious  inflammatory involvement of the adductors of the thigh may result in a  generalization of the infection by way of the inguinal lymph glands.    Large open wounds that extend deep into muscles, render inactive such  structures, and even where division is not complete, the pain occasioned  causes the subject to favor the part in every way possible. Contraction  of muscular fibers of such parts increases pain and because of this fact  groups of muscles are at times disabled because of injury done to one  muscle. Instances of this kind are frequently seen where shoulder  injuries, which affect but one muscle, exist; yet because of such injury  a marked swinging-leg lameness is present.    Tendons, because of their inelasticity, are subjected to injuries  peculiar to themselves. In addition to being affected as are muscles,  wounds of many kinds are found to affect tendons--contusions,  interference wounds, penetrant wounds, incised wounds and lacerations.    However, the commoner form of injury done tendons, is strain or sprain.  Because of the sudden tensile strain brought to bear upon tendons in the  shocks of concussion, as well as in propulsion of the body, there  frequently occurs a rupture of fibers and this we know as sprain.    Sprains may be considered as fibrillary fractures of soft structures and  since this form of injury is subsurface, and limited to fractional  portions of tendons, the inflammation occasioned usually remains an  aseptic one. Reaction to this form of injury is characterized by  inflammation, the course of which is erratic and variable. In chronic  inflammation of tendons, where animals are continued in service, the  usual sequel is contraction, or shortening of these structures.    The degree of contraction as well as its import varies in different  subjects and in the various tendons which may be affected. Contraction  is a slow-going process that is progressive, gradually causing a  decrease in the length of the affected structure and eventually  rendering the animal useless.    The practice of applying shoes with extended toe-calks for the purpose  of \"stretching\" contracted deep digital flexor tendons (flexor pedis  perforans) cannot be too strongly condemned. While the addition of an  extension such as is ordinarily employed to the toe of a shoe of this  kind, prevents for a time, frequent stumbling in such cases, the  increased tensile strain which is thus occasioned hastens further  contraction and subjects animals so shod to much unnecessary pain.      AFFECTIONS OF NERVES.    Because of their being protected by other structures, nerve trunks,  which supply muscles of locomotion, are not subjected to frequent  injuries such as contusions. However, they do become injured at times  and the result is lameness, more or less severe.    Lameness originating from nerve affection, may involve central  structures as, for example, the spinal cord, medulla oblongata or parts  of the brain. In making an examination of some lame animals it is  necessary to distinguish between cases of lameness that are of central  origin and marked by incooerdination of movement, and disturbances caused  by other affections. Tetanus in its incipiency should not be confused  with laminitis involving all four feet, or with certain forms of  pleuritis, when careful examination is made, yet, in a way, to one not  trained, the clinical symptoms are similar.    Disturbances of nerve function are caused in a variety of ways. It is  not within the scope of this work to discuss central nervous  disturbances caused by ingestion of mouldy provender, or disturbances of  the brain or cord occasioned by infectious diseases, but mention of the  existence of such conditions is appropriate.    By direct injury the result of blows, certain nerves are injured and  muscles supplied by such nerves are rendered inactive. Depending upon  the nature and extent of an injury thus inflicted, so the manner in  which the affection is manifested varies. The suprascapular nerve is  rather frequently injured causing partial or complete loss of function  of the structures supplied by this nerve, and abduction of the  scapulohumeral joint naturally results.    In some cases of dystocia the obturator nerve, (or nerves, if the  involvement is bilateral), becomes injured by being caught between the  maternal pelvis and some dense part of the fetus. This results in  paralysis of the adductors of the thigh if sufficient injury is done.    It is said that nerves become over-stretched and held tense, in certain  positions in which animals are obliged to remain while cast in  confinement such as in some instances where unusual methods of restraint  are employed. When the fore feet are drawn backward in such manner that  great strain is put upon the radial nerve, it suffers more or less  injury, and this is followed by partial or complete paralysis which may  be temporary or permanent.    Degenerative changes affecting nerves, as in other tissues, occur and  more or less locomotory impediment will follow--this depending upon the  nerve or nerves affected and the nature of such involvement. Tumors may  surround nerves and eventually the nerve so exposed becomes implicated  in the destructive process. Before degenerative changes take place in  the nerve substance, in such cases, pressure may completely paralyze a  nerve when it is so situated. Melanotic tumors in the paraproctal tissue  in some cases, because of the large size of the new-growths, cause  paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The author has seen one case of brachial  paralysis occasioned by an enormous development of fibrous tissue  involving the structures about the ulna.      AFFECTIONS OF BLOOD VESSELS.    Lameness caused by disturbances of circulation may be due to structural  affection of vessels, or functional disorders of the heart, and in some  instances, a combination of these causes may be active.    Direct involvement of vessels is the commoner form of circulatory  disturbance which occasions lameness, and the most frequent cause is of  parasitic origin. Sclerostomiasis with attendant arteritis, thrombus  formation and subsequent lodgement of emboli in the iliac, femoral, or  other arteries, causes sufficient obstruction to prevent free  circulation of blood, and the characteristic lameness of thrombosis  results.    Indirect injury to vessels may occur because of contused wounds and  subsequent inflammation of tissues supplied by such vessels. If the  injury be of sufficient extent, considerable extravasation of blood will  take place and the painfully swollen parts necessarily impair  locomotion. In such instances lymph "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#6)"],[1," used to be called Amygdaloides, because of its being  interspersed with several white spots, which resemble broken almonds.  When heated, these white specks rise as a smoke, which is easily  condensed upon paper. The material thus separated from the benzoin is  called flowers of benzoin in commerce, and by chemists is termed benzoic  acid. It has all, or nearly all, the odor of the resin from which it is  derived.    The extract, or tincture of benzoin, forms a good basis for a  bouquet.[B] Like balsam of Tolu, it gives permanence and body to a  perfume made with an essential oil in spirit.    The principal consumption of benzoin is in the manufacture of pastilles  (see PASTILLES), and for the preparation of fictitious vanilla  pomade (see POMATUMS).    CARAWAY.--This odoriferous principle is drawn by distillation  from the seeds of the _Carum carui_. It has a very pleasant smell, quite  familiar enough without description. It is well adapted to perfume soap,  for which it is much used in England, though rarely if ever on the  continent; when dissolved in spirit it may be used in combination with  oil of lavender and bergamot for the manufacture of cheap essences, in a  similar way to cloves (see CLOVES). If caraway seeds are  ground, they are well adapted for mixing to form sachet powder (see  SACHETS).    CASCARILLA.--The bark is used in the formation of pastilles,  and also enters into the composition known as _Eau a Bruler_, for  perfuming apartments, to which we refer.    The bark alone of this plant is used by the manufacturing perfumer, and  that only in the fabrication of pastilles. The _Cascarilla gratissimus_  is however so fragrant, that according to Burnett its leaves are  gathered by the Koras of the Cape of Good Hope as a perfume, and both  the _C. fragrans_ and _C. fragilis_ are odoriferous. It behooves  perfumers, therefore, who are on the look out for novelties, to obtain  these leaves and ascertain the result of their distillation.    Messrs. Herring and Co., some years ago, drew the oil of cascarilla, but  it was only offered to the trade as a curiosity.    CASSIA.--The essential oil of cassia is procured by distilling  the outer bark of the _Cinnamomum cassia_. 1 cwt. of bark yields rather  more than three quarters of a pound of oil; it has a pale yellow color;  in smell it much resembles cinnamon, although very inferior to it. It is  principally used for perfuming soap, especially what is called \"military  soap,\" as it is more aromatic or spicy than flowery in odor; it  therefore finds no place for handkerchief use.    CASSIE.--        \"The short narcissus and fair daffodil,      Pansies to please the sight, and _cassie_ sweet to swell.\"        DRYDEN'S _Virgil_.    This is one of those fine odors which enters into the composition of the  best handkerchief bouquets.    [Illustration: Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana.]    When smelled at alone, it has an intense violet odor, and is rather  sickly sweet.    It is procured by maceration from the _Acacia farnesiana_. The purified  fat is melted, into which the flowers are thrown and left to digest for  several hours; the spent flowers are removed, and fresh are added, eight  or ten times, until sufficient richness of perfume is obtained. As many  flowers are used as the grease will cover, when they are put into it, in  a liquid state.    After being strained, and the pomade has been kept at a heat sufficient  only to retain its liquidity, all impurities will subside by standing  for a few days. Finally cooled, it is the cassie pomade of commerce. The  _Huile de Cassie_, or fat oil of cassie, is prepared in a similar  manner, substituting the oil of Egyptian ben nut, olive oil, or almond  oil, in place of suet. Both these preparations are obviously only a  solution of the true essential oil of cassie flowers in the neutral  fatty body. Europe may shortly be expecting to import a similar scented  pomade from South Australia, derived from the Wattle, a plant that  belongs to the same genus as the _A. farnesiana_, and which grows most  luxuriantly in Australia. Mutton fat being cheap, and the wattle  plentiful, a profitable trade may be anticipated in curing the flowers,  &c.    To prepare the extract of cassie, take six pounds of No. 24 (best  quality) cassie pomade, and place upon it one gallon of the best  rectified spirit, as sent out by Bowerbank, of Bishopsgate. After it has  digested for three weeks or a month, at a summer heat, it is fit to draw  from the pomatum, and, if good, has a beautiful green color and rich  flowery smell of the cassie blossom. All extracts made by this  process--_maceration_, or, as it may be called, cold _infusion_, give a  more natural smell of the flowers to the result, than by merely  dissolving the essential oil (procured by distillation) in the spirit;  moreover, where the odor of the flower exists in only very minute  quantities, as in the present instance, and with violet, jasmine, &c.,  it is the only practical mode of proceeding.    In this, and all other similar cases, the pomatum must be cut up into  very small pieces, after the domestic manner of \"chopping suet,\" prior  to its being infused in the alcohol. The action of the mixture is simply  a change of place in the odoriferous matter, which leaves the fat body  by the superior attraction, or affinity, as the chemists say, of the  spirits of wine, in which it freely dissolves.    The major part of the extract can be poured or drawn off the pomatum  without trouble, but it still retains a portion in the interstices,  which requires time to drain away, and this must be assisted by placing  the pomatum in a large funnel, supported by a bottle, in order to  collect the remainder. Finally, all the pomatum, which is now called  _washed pomatum_, is to be put into a tin, which tin must be set into  hot water, for the purpose of melting its contents; when the pomatum  thus becomes liquefied, any extract that is still in it rises to the  surface, and can be skimmed off, or when the pomatum becomes cold it can  be poured from it.    The washed pomatum is preserved for use in the manufacture of dressing  for the hair, for which purpose it is exceedingly well adapted, on  account of the purity of the grease from which it was originally  prepared, but more particularly on account of a certain portion of odor  which it still retains; and were it not used up in this way, it would be  advisable to put it for a second infusion in spirit, and thus a weaker  extract could be made serviceable for lower priced articles.    I cannot leave cassie without recommending it more especially to the  notice of perfumers and druggists, as an article well adapted for the  purpose of the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief and pomades  for the hair. When diluted with other odors, it imparts to the whole  such a true flowery fragrance, that it is the admiration of all who  smell it, and has not a little contributed to the great sale which  certain proprietary articles have attained.    We caution the inexperienced not to confound cassie with cassia, which  has a totally different odor. See ACACIA POMADE.    CEDAR WOOD now and then finds a place in a perfumer's  warehouse; when ground, it does well to form a body for sachet powder.  Slips of cedar wood are sold as matches for lighting lamps, because  while burning an agreeable odor is evolved; some people use it also, in  this condition, distributed among clothes in drawers to \"prevent moth.\"  On distillation it yields an essential oil that is exceedingly fragrant.    Messrs. Rigge and Co., of London, use it extensively for scenting soap.    LEBANON CEDAR WOOD. (_For the Handkerchief._)    Otto of cedar,             1 oz.  Rectified spirit,        1 pint.  Esprit rose trip,      1/4 pint.    The tincture smells agreeably of the wood, from which it can readily be  made. Its crimson color, however, prohibits it from being used for the  handkerchief. It forms an excellent tincture for the teeth, and is the  basis of the celebrated French dentifrice \"eau Botot.\"    CEDRAT.--This perfume is procured from the rind of the citron  fruit (_Citrus medica_), both by distillation and expression; it has a  very beautiful lemony odor, and is much admired. It is principally used  in the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief, being too expensive  for perfuming grease or soap. What is called extract of cedrat is made  by dissolving two ounces of the above essential oil of citron in one  pint of spirits, to which some perfumers add half an ounce of bergamot.    CINNAMON.--Several species of the plant _Laurus cinnamomum_  yield the cinnamon and cassia of commerce. Its name is said to be  derived from _China Amomum_, the bark being one of the most valued  spices of the East. Perfumers use both the bark and the oil, which is  obtained by distillation from it. The ground bark enters into the  composition of some pastilles, tooth powders, and sachets. The essential  oil of cinnamon is principally brought to this country from Ceylon; it  is exceedingly powerful, and must be used sparingly. In such compounds  as cloves answer, so will cinnamon.    CITRON.--On distilling the flowers of the _Citrus medica_, a  very fragrant oil is procured, which is a species of neroli, and is  principally consumed by the manufacturers of eau de Cologne.    CITRONELLA.--Under this name there is an oil in the market,  chiefly derived from Ceylon and the East Indies; its true origin we are  unable to decide; in odor it somewhat resembles citron fruit, but is  very inferior. Probably it is procured from one of the grasses of the  _Andropogon_ genus. Being cheap, it is extensively used for perfuming  soap. What is now extensively sold as \"honey\" soap, is a fine yellow  soap slightly perfumed with this oil. Some few use it for scenting  grease, but it is not much admired in that way.    CLOVES.--Every part of the clove plant (_Caryophyllus  aromaticus_) abounds "]]]
