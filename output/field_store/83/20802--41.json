Thus doth genius receive its  reward. Songbird, if I were you, I'd give up writing poems, and go turn  railroad president, track-walker, or something like that.\"    \"You boys are simply horrid, don't you know!\" cried Tubbs, and, pushing  his way through the crowd, he walked to the other end of the boat.    \"Being away from school hasn't done Tubby any good,\" was Fred  Garrison's remark. \"He thinks he's the High Tum-Tum, and no mistake.\"    \"Don't fret, he'll be taken down before the term is over,\" came from  Larry Colby.    \"That's true,\" added another pupil, who had been taken down himself two  terms before. \"And when he hits his level he'll be just as good as any  of us.\"    The time on the steamer passed quickly enough, and after several stops  along the lake, the Golden Star turned in at the Cedarville landing,  and all of the Putnam Hall cadets went ashore.          CHAPTER VII    SOMETHING ABOUT THE MILITARY ACADEMY      As my old readers know, Cedarville was only a small country village, so  the arrival and departure of the steamer was a matter of importance to  the inhabitants.    The boys, consequently, found the little dock crowded with sightseers  and more than one face looked familiar to them.    \"There are the Rover boys,\" said one man, quite loudly. \"Everybody  knows 'em.\"    \"We are growing notorious, it would seem,\" whispered Dick to Sam.    Back of the dock stood the big carryall attached to Putnam Hall, with  the old Hall driver, Peleg Snuggers, on the box.    \"Hullo, Peleg, old friend!\" shouted Tom, waving his hand at the man.  \"How are we to-morrow, as the clown in the circus puts it?\"    \"I'm all right, Master Tom--an' will be so long as you let me alone,\"  was the deliberate answer from the driver.    \"He remembers you all right enough, Tom,\" came from George Granbury.    \"Now, Peleg, don't throw cold water on my enthusiasm,\" said Tom  reproachfully.    \"I ain't throwin' water on nobody, Master Tom; I'm only giving fair  warning that I want to be let alone,\" answered the driver doggedly. \"No  more monkey shines around me, remember that.\"    \"All right, Peleg, I'll remember. And how is Mrs. Green, our worthy  housekeeper?\"    \"First-rate.\"    \"No whooping-cough?\"    \"No.\"    \"Nor measles, or chicken-pox?\"    \"Not a bit of 'em.\"    \"Or mumps? Tell me, now, she really hasn't got the mumps, has she?\"    \"See here, Master Tom, didn't I jest tell you--\"    \"No, you didn't tell me, and that's why I'm so anxious to know. If  she's got the mumps, and the chilblains, and the ingrowing warts--\"    \"Oh, crickey! I knew it!\" groaned Peleg Snuggers. \"I says to myself as I  was a-drivin' over, 'if thet Tom Rover comes back, I might as well throw  up my job, for he won't give nobody a rest!' If you would only--\"    \"All right, Peleg, I see you are really and truly bound to go back on  me. You hate me!\" Tom drew his handkerchief from his pocket. \"It is  awful, after all I have tried to do for you in the past. I've got to--  to--cry! Boo--hoo!\" And the boy began to wipe his eyes.    \"Look a-here, Master Tom, it ain't nothin' to cry about,\" said Peleg  half suspiciously. \"I only give you warnin'--\"    \"You are so--so hard-hearted, Peleg. Boohoo! I want to go back home!\"  And Tom began to sob.    This was too much for the driver, and his face fell.    \"Don't you mind me, Master Tom,\" he said softly. \"I didn't mean  nothin', indeed, I didn't. You're all right. I like you better'n any of  'em.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" burst out Larry Colby. \"Just to hear that!\"    \"Peleg, have you gone back on us?\" demanded George Granbury.    \"He ought to have a ducking for that,\" put in another.    \"Let's dump him into the lake!\"    \"Come on, a cold bath will do him good!\"    \"No! no! Oh, crickey!\" groaned the driver of the carryall. \"This is a  mess! I--I didn't mean nuthin', gents, indeed, I didn't--\"    \"He's mean enough for anything, that's what he means,\" came from a  voice in the rear. \"Pile in, before he runs away, and leaves us to walk  to the Hall!\" And into the carryall the boys tumbled, one over another.  Dick got a seat beside the driver, and away they went at a spanking  gait, through Cedarville, and then along the winding road leading to  the academy. Two or three of the cadets had brought tin horns with  them, and they made the welkin ring as the turnout dashed on its way.    \"A ginger-snap prize to the first fellow who spots the academy,\" cried  Sam, as they made the last turn in the highway.    \"I see the Hall!\" shouted half a dozen voices in chorus. And in a few  seconds they came out into full view of the broad brick and stone  building, with its well-kept parade ground, and its trees and  shrubbery. The parade ground came down to the edge of the wagon road,  and off to the other side the land sloped gradually down to the lake,  glistening like a sheet of gold in the rays of the setting sun.    The boys set up a loud shout and a wild blowing of horns, and in a  moment a score of cadets came running forward to greet them, followed  by Captain Victor Putnam, the master of the academy, and George Strong,  his head assistant.    \"I am glad to see you, young gentlemen,\" said Captain Putnam, as he  shook one and another by the hand. \"You look as if your vacation had  done you good.\"    \"It's done me a pile of good,\" said Sam. \"But I don't know as I want  another like it.\"    \"You Rover boys have certainly had some remarkable experiences,\"  continued the captain. \"I congratulate you on escaping so many grave  perils. Sometime you must give me all the particulars. But now it is  time to prepare for supper. I dare say the trip on the lake has made  you hungry.\"    \"Dot is so,\" came from Hans Mueller. \"I vos so hungry like four lions  alretty.\"    \"I have made some slight changes in your sleeping accommodations,\" went  on Captain Putnam. \"Mr. Strong will show you to your rooms.\" Then the  boys marched into the academy, led by the head assistant.    The majority of the cadets had their dormitories on the second floor of  the building. Each room held from four to eight students, and was both  bright and clean. The rules of Putnam Hall were similar to those in  force at West Point, and every pupil was expected to keep his clothing,  his books, and his other possessions in perfect order. Each had a cot,  a chair, and a clothes closet to himself, extra closets having been  introduced in the rooms for that purpose, and each was allowed the use  of his trunk in addition. Each cadet had to take his turn at keeping the  room in order, although the dormitories were given a regular sweeping  and cleaning once a week by the servants.    As before, the Rover boys were placed in one room, and into this came  also Larry Colby, Fred Garrison, and George Granbury. The apartment was  at an angle of the building, and next to it was another occupied by  Songbird Powell, Tubbs, Hans, and three other cadets. Between the two  rooms was a door, but this was closed, and was supposed to be kept  locked.    \"This makes one feel like home,\" said Sam, as he began to wash up for  supper.    \"Right you are,\" answered Larry Colby. \"No matter where I go during a  vacation, I am always glad to get back to Putnam Hall.\"    A little later came the evening parade of the cadets, who marched  around the parade ground several times before entering the messroom, as  the dining hall was termed. The late arrivals did not join in the  parade, but they watched it with interest, and then hurried to their  accustomed places at the long tables, where a plain, but substantial  supper awaited them.    Only a little talking was allowed throughout the meal, but at its  conclusion the cadets were given an hour off, in which time they could  do very much as they pleased. In that hour some played games, others  took walks, and not a few drifted over to the gymnasium, which stood at  one corner of the grounds.    \"I'm going over to the gym,\" said Dick to Larry Colby. \"Want to go  along?\"    \"Certainly,\" was the prompt answer. \"I am going in for gymnastics this  term, Dick.\"    \"Want to win some of the prizes when we have our contests?\"    \"If I can.\"    \"I don't see why you shouldn't, Larry. You seem to be in first-class  shape physically.\"    \"I am going to try hard, Dick.\"    They were soon in the building, and Larry slipped off to the dressing  room to don his gymnasium suit.    While Dick was waiting for his friend to reappear he looked on at the  efforts of the other cadets present. Some were on the rings and bars,  others were using the parallel bars and horses, and still others were  at the pulling and lifting machines. In one corner two of the boys  were boxing, while another was hammering a punching bag as hard as he  could.    The boy at the punching bag was a tall, big-boned youth, named Lew  Flapp. He was a newcomer at Putnam Hall, but though he had been there  but three weeks he acted as if half of the place already belonged to  him. At the start, he had made a few friends, principally on account of  the money he had to spend, but these were gradually deserting him.    Dick was interested in the work on the punching bag, and he walked  closer to note what Lew Flapp was doing. Clap! clap! clap! went Flapp's  fists on the bag, which bounced back and forth with great rapidity.    \"Well, how do you like that?\" asked Lew Flapp, as he paused in his  exercise and stared at Dick.    \"It's all right,\" answered Dick briefly.    \"I'll bet there ain't another cadet here can do as well,\" went on Lew  Flapp boastfully.    \"Oh, that's saying a good deal,\" said Dick. \"Some of the boys can hit  the bag"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#6)"],[1,"see to what extent murder, in the widest sense of  the word, including wilful murder, manslaughter, and infanticide,  prevails in the various countries of Europe. In ordinary circumstances  this task would be a laborious one, entailing a minute and careful  examination of the criminal statistics and procedure of many nations.  Fortunately, it has recently been accomplished by Dr. Bosco in an  admirable monograph communicated in the first instance to the Journal  of the International Statistical Institute, but now published in a  separate form. Bosco's figures have all been taken from official  sources, and may, therefore, be accepted as accurate; but, before  tabulating-them, it may be useful to make an extract from the  explanatory note by which they are accompanied. \"As the composition of  the population, with respect to age, varies in different countries, and  as it has to be remembered that all the population under ten years of  age has no share, at least under normal conditions, in the crime of  murder, it has seemed to me a more exact method to calculate the  proportion of murders to the inhabitants who are over ten years of age,  than to include the total population. For those States where a census  has been recently taken, such, for instance, as France and Germany, the  results of that census have been used; that is to say, the French  census of May, 1886, and the German census of December, 1885. For the  other States the population has been calculated (adding the excess of  births over deaths to the results of the last census) to the end of the  intermediate year for each period of years to which the information  relates; that is to say, to the end of 1883 for Belgium, and to the end  of 1884 for Austria, Hungary, Spain, England, Scotland and Ireland. As  the information respecting Italy refers to 1887 only, the population  has been estimated up to the end of that year. The division of the  population according to age (above and below ten) has been obtained by  means of proportional calculations based on the results of the census  for each State. In the case of France and Germany, however, it has been  taken directly from the census returns.\"[16]    Homicides of all kinds in the following European States:--    ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Tried.

Appunti di statistica      comparata del Dr A. Bosco_, 1889.    What is the import of these statistics? We perceive at once that  Italy, Spain and Hungary head the list in the proportion of murders to  the population. In Italy, out of every 100,000 persons over ten years  of age, eleven in round numbers are annually convicted of murder in  one or other of its forms; in Spain eight are convicted of the same  offence, and in Hungary five are convicted. These three countries are  conspicuously ahead of all the others to which our table refers.  Austria and Belgium follow at a long distance with two convictions in  round numbers to every 100,000 inhabitants over ten. France, Ireland  and Germany come next with one conviction and a considerable fraction  to every 100,000 persons over ten; England, Scotland and Holland stand  at the bottom of the list with between seven and eight persons  convicted of murder to every one million of inhabitants over ten.    In order to understand the full meaning of these figures we must take  one more stop and compare the numbers convicted with the numbers  tried. In some countries very few convictions may take place in  proportion to the number accused, while in other countries the  proportion may be very considerable. In other words, in order to  arrive at an approximate estimate of the amount of murders perpetrated  in a country, we must consider how many cases of murder have been  tried in the course of the year. It very seldom happens that a person  is tried for this offence when no murder has been committed; and it  may, therefore, be assumed that the crime has taken place when a man  haw to stand his trial for it. Estimating then the prevalence of  murder in the various countries by trials, rather than convictions,  it will be found that Germany, with a much larger percentage of  convictions than England, has just as few cases of murder for trial.  And the reason the number of convictions, as between the two nations,  differs, arises from the fact that a prisoner's chance of acquittal in  England is a hundred per cent. greater than it is in Germany. It is  not, therefore, accurate to assume that a greater number of murders  are committed in Germany than in England because a greater number  of persons are annually convicted of this crime; all that these  convictions absolutely prove is, that the machinery of the criminal  law is more effective in the one country than in the other. To take  another instance, more persons are annually tried for murder in  Ireland than in France; but more cases of conviction are recorded in  France than in Ireland. These contrasts show that, while the French  are less addicted to this grave offence than the Irish, they are more  anxious to secure its detection, and that a greater body of public  opinion is on the side of law in France than in Ireland. All these  instances (and more could easily be added to them) are intended to  call attention to the importance of looking at the number of persons  tried, as well as the percentage of persons convicted, if we desire to  form an accurate estimate of the comparative prevalence of crime.    While thus showing that the number of trials for murder is the best  test of the prevalence of this offence, it is not meant that the test  is in all respects indisputable. At most it is merely approximate. One  obstacle in the way of its entire accuracy consists in the circumstance  that the proportion of persons tried, as compared with the amount of  crime committed, is in no two countries precisely the same. In France,  for instance, more murders are perpetrated, for which no one is  ultimately tried, than in Italy or in England; that is to say, a  murderer runs more risk of being placed in the dock in this country  than in France. But the difference between the two countries is again  to a great extent adjusted by the fact that once a man is placed in  the dock in France he has far less chance of being acquitted than if  he were tried according to English law. On the whole, therefore, it  may be assumed that the international statistics of trials, corrected  when necessary by the international statistics of convictions, present  a tolerably accurate idea of the extent to which the crime of murder  prevails among the nationalities of Europe. In any case these figures  will go some way towards helping us to see whether climatic conditions  have any influence upon the amount of crime. This we shall now inquire  into.    On looking at the isotherms for the year it will be observed that the  average temperature of Italy and Spain is ten degrees higher than  the average temperature of England. On the other hand, the average  temperature of Hungary is very much the same as the average temperature  of this country; but Hungary is at the same time exposed to much  greater extremes of climate than England. In winter it is nearly ten  degrees colder than England, while in summer it is as hot as Spain.  The advocates of the direct effect of climate upon crime contend that  account must be taken not merely of the degree of temperature, but  also of the variations of temperature to which a region is exposed.  According to this theory one of the principal reasons the crime of  murder is, at least, fourfold higher in Hungary than in England, is to  be found in the violent oscillations of temperature in Hungary as  compared with England. In Italy murders are, at least, ten times as  numerous as in England; in Spain they are seven times as numerous; the  chief cause of this condition of things is said to be the serious  difference of temperature. In the United States of America there are  more crimes of blood in the South than in the North; the main  explanation of this difference is said to be that the climate of the  South is much hotter than the climate of the North.    In opposition to this theory of the intimate relation between  temperature and crime, it may be urged that the greater prevalence of  crimes of blood in hot latitudes is a mere coincidence and not a  causal connection. This is the view taken by Dr. Mischler in Baron von  Holtzendorff's \"Handbuch des Gefaengnisswesens.\" He says the real  reason crimes of blood are more common in the South of Europe than in  the North is to be attributed to the more backward state of  civilisation in the South, and to the wild and mountainous character  of the country. To the latter part of this argument it is"]]]
