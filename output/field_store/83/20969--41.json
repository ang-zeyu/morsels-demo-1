Men  who were millionaires at nightfall awoke the next morning to find  themselves bankrupt through depreciation of their stock-holdings.  Prosperous firms of importers were put out of business. International  commerce was dislocated to an extent unprecedented in history.    The greatest of hardships immediately following the war, however, were  visited upon those who unhappily were caught on their vacations or on  their business trips within the area affected by the war. Not only men,  but women and children, were subjected to privations of the severest  character. Notes which had been negotiable, paper money of every  description, and even silver currency suddenly became of little value.  Americans living in hotels and pensions facing this sudden shrinkage in  their money, were compelled to leave the roofs that had sheltered them.  That which was true of Americans was true of all other nationalities, so  that every embassy and the office of every consul became a miniature  Babel of excited, distressed humanity.    The sudden seizure of railroads for war purposes in Germany, France,  Austria and Russia, cut off thousands of travelers in villages that were  almost inaccessible. Europeans being comparatively close to their homes,  were not in straits as severe as the Americans whose only hope for aid  lay in the speedy arrival of American gold. Prices of food soared beyond  all precedent and many of these hapless strangers went under. Paris, the  brightest and gayest city in Europe, suddenly became the most somber of  dwelling places. No traffic was permitted on the highways at night. No  lights were permitted and all the cafes were closed at eight o'clock.  The gay capital was placed under iron military rule.    Seaports, and especially the pleasure resorts in France, Belgium and  England, were placed under a military supervision. Visitors were ordered  to return to their homes and every resort was shrouded with darkness at  night. The records of those early days are filled with stories of  dramatic happenings.    On the night of July 31st Jean Leon Jaures, the famous leader of French  Socialists, was assassinated while dining in a small restaurant near the  Paris Bourse. His assassin was Raoul Villein. Jaures had been  endeavoring to accomplish a union of French and German Socialists with  the aim of preventing the war. The object of the assassination appeared  to have been wholly political.    On the same day stock exchanges throughout the United States were  closed, following the example of European stock exchanges. Ship  insurance soared to prohibitive figures. Reservists of the French and  German armies living outside of their native land were called to the  colors and their homeward rush still further complicated transportation  for civilians. All the countries of Europe clamored for gold. North and  South America complied with the demand by sending cargoes of the  precious metal overseas. The German ship Kron Prinzessin with a cargo of  gold, attempted to make the voyage to Hamburg, but a wireless warning  that Allied cruisers were waiting for it off the Grand Banks of  Newfoundland, compelled the big ship to turn back to safety in America.    Channel boats bearing American refugees from the Continent to London  were described as floating hells. London was excited over the war and  holiday spirit, and overrun with five thousand citizens of the United  States tearfully pleading with the American Ambassador for money for  transportation home or assurances of personal safety.    The condition of the terror-stricken tourists fleeing to the friendly  shores of England from Continental countries crowded with soldiers  dragging in their wake heavy guns, resulted in an extraordinary  gathering of two thousand Americans at a hotel one afternoon and the  formation of a preliminary organization to afford relief. Some people  who attended the meeting were already beginning to feel the pinch of  want with little prospects of immediate succor. One man and wife, with  four children, had six cents when he appealed to Ambassador Page after  an exciting escape from German territory.      [Illustration: WHERE THE WORLD WAR BEGAN. Map showing 15 degrees East to  28 degrees East; 35 degrees North to 52 degrees North. Germany and  Russia on the North; the Mediterranean on the South; the Adriatic Sea  on the West; the Aegean and Western Turkey on the East.]      Oscar Straus, worth ten millions, struck London with nine dollars.  Although he had letters of credit for five thousand, he was unable to  cash them in Vienna. Women hugging newspaper bundles containing  expensive Paris frocks and millinery were herded in third-class  carriages and compelled to stand many hours. They reached London utterly  fatigued and unkempt, but mainly cheerful, only to find the hotels  choked with fellow countrymen fortunate to reach there sooner.    The Ambassador was harassed by anxious women and children who asked many  absurd questions which he could not answer. He said:    \"The appeals of these people are most distressing. They are very much  excited, and no small wonder. I regret I have no definite news of the  prospects or plans of the government for relief. I have communicated  their condition to the Department of State and expect a response and  assurances of coming aid as soon as possible. That the government will  act I have not the slightest doubt. I am confident that Washington will  do everything in her power for relief. How soon, I cannot tell. I have  heard many distressing tales during the last forty-eight hours.\"    A crowd filled the Ambassador's office on the first floor of the flat  building, in Victoria Street, which was mainly composed of women, school  teachers, art students, and other persons doing Europe on a shoestring.  Many were entirely out of money and with limited securities, which were  not negotiable.    The action of the British Government extending the bank holiday till  Thursday of that week was discouraging news for the new arrivals from  the Continent, as it was uncertain whether the express and steamship  companies would open in the morning for the cashing of checks and the  delivery of mail, as was announced the previous Saturday.    Doctors J. Riddle Goffe, of New York; Frank F. Simpson, of Pittsburgh;  Arthur D. Ballon of Vistaburg, Mich., and B. F. Martin, of Chicago,  formed themselves into a committee, and asked the co-operation of the  press in America to bring about adequate assistance for the marooned  Americans, and to urge the bankers of the United States to insist on  their letters of credit and travelers' checks being honored so far as  possible by the agents in Europe upon whom they were drawn.      [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS]    In the first weeks of the war the Germans occupied Rheims, but were    driven out after von Kluck's retreat. On September 20, 1914, they were    reported as first shelling the Cathedral of Rheims and the civilized    world stood aghast, for the edifice, begun in 1212, is one of the    chief glories of Gothic architecture in all Europe.

THE KAISER AND HIS SIX SONS    The ex-Emperor and his sons leading a procession in Berlin soon after    the declaration of war. It was noted that in spite of their martial    appearance the royal family were extremely careful to keep out of    range of the Allied guns. From left to right they are: The Kaiser,    Crown Prince Wilhelm, Princes Eitel Friedrich, Adalbert, August, Oscar    and Joachim.      Dr. Martin and Dr. Simpson, who left London on Saturday for Switzerland  to fetch back a young American girl, were unable to get beyond Paris,  and they returned to London. Everywhere they found trains packed with  refugees whose only object in life apparently was to reach the channel  boats, accepting cheerfully the discomforts of those vessels if only  able to get out of the war.    Rev. J. P. Garfield, of Claremore, N. H., gave the following account of  his experiences in Holland:    \"On sailing from the Hook of Holland near midnight we pulled out just as  the boat train from The Hague arrived. The steamer paused, but as she  was filled to her capacity she later continued on her voyage, leaving  fully two hundred persons marooned on the wharf.    \"Our discomforts while crossing the North Sea were great. Every seat was  filled with sleepers, the cabins were given to women and children. The  crowd, as a rule, was helpful and kindly, the single men carrying the  babies and people lending money to those without funds. Despite the  refugee conditions prevailing it was noticeable that many women on the  Hook wharf clung tenaciously to bandboxes containing Parisian hats.\"    Travelers from Cologne said that searchlights were operated from the  tops of the hotels all night searching for airplanes, and machine guns  were mounted on the famous Cologne Cathedral. They also reported that  tourists were refused hotel accommodations at Frankfort because they  were without cash.    Men, women and children sat in the streets all night. The trains were  stopped several miles from the German frontier and the passengers,  especially the women and children, suffered great hardship being forced  to continue their journey on foot.    Passengers arriving at London from Montreal on the Cunard Line steamer  Andania, bound for Southampton, reported the vessel was met at sea by a  British torpedo boat and ordered by wireless to stop. The liner then was  led into Plymouth as a matter of precaution against mines. Plymouth was  filled with soldiers and searchlights were seen constantly flashing  about the harbor.    Otis B. Kent, an attorney for the Interstate Commerce Commission, of  Washington, arrived in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19031"],[0,"A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons (#6)"],[1,"detected in them.      EXPERIMENT.    Fill a wine-glass with distilled water, and add to it a few drops of a  solution of soap in alcohol, the water will remain transparent.    This test is employed for ascertaining the presence of earthy salts in  waters. Hence it produces no change when mingled with distilled or  perfectly pure water; but when added to water containing earthy salts, a  white flocculent matter becomes separated, which speedily collects on  the surface of the fluid. Now, from the quantity of flocculent matter  produced, in equal quantities of water submitted to the test, a  tolerable notion may be formed of the degrees of hardness of different  kinds of water, at least so far as regards the fitness of the water for  the ordinary purposes of domestic economy. This may be rendered obvious  in the following manner.      EXPERIMENT.    Fill a number of wine-glasses with different kinds of pump or well  water, and let fall into each glass a few drops of the solution of soap  in alcohol. A turbidness will instantly ensue, and a flocculent matter  collect on the surface of the fluid, if the mixture be left undisturbed.  The quantity of flocculent matter will be in the ratio of the quantity  of earthy salts contained in the water.    It is obvious that the action of this test is not discriminative, with  regard to the chemical nature of the earthy salt present in the water.  It serves only to indicate the _presence_ or _absence_ of those kinds of  substances which occasion that quality in water which is usually called  _hardness_, and which is always owing to salts with an earthy base.    If we wish to know the nature of the different acids and earths  contained in the water, the following test may be employed.[15]      EXPERIMENT.    Add about twenty drops of a solution of oxalate of ammonia, to half a  wine-glass of the water; if a white precipitate ensues, we conclude that  the water contains lime.    By means of this test, one grain of lime may be detected in 24,250 of  water.    If this test occasion a white precipitate in water taken fresh from the  pump or spring, and not after the water has been boiled and suffered to  grow cold, the lime is dissolved in the water by an excess of carbonic  acid; and if it continues to produce a precipitate in the water which  has been concentrated by boiling, we then are sure that the lime is  combined with a fixed acid.      EXPERIMENT.    To detect the presence of iron, add to a wine-glassful of the water a  few drops of an infusion of nut-galls; or better, suffer a nut-gall to  be suspended in it for twenty-four hours, which will cause the water to  acquire a blueish black colour, if iron be present.      EXPERIMENT.    Add a few grains of muriate of barytes, to half a wine-glass of the  water to be examined; if it produces a turbidness which does not  disappear by the admixture of a few drops of muriatic acid, the presence  of sulphuric acid is rendered obvious.      EXPERIMENT.    If a few drops of a solution of nitrate of silver occasions a milkiness  with the water, which vanishes again by the copious addition of liquid  ammonia, we have reason to believe that the water contains a salt, one  of the constituent parts of which is muriatic acid.      EXPERIMENT.    If lime water or barytic water occasions a precipitate which again  vanishes by the admixture of muriatic acid, then carbonic acid is  present in the water.      EXPERIMENT.    If a solution of phosphate of soda produces a milkiness with the water,  after a previous addition to it of a similar quantity of neutral  carbonate of ammonia, we may then expect magnesia. The application of  this test is best made in the following manner:    Concentrate a quantity of the water to be examined to about 1/20 part of  its bulk, and drop into about half a wine-glassful, about five grains of  neutral carbonate of ammonia. No magnesia becomes yet precipitated if  this earth be present; but on adding a like quantity of phosphate of  soda, the magnesia falls down, as an insoluble salt. It is essential  that the carbonate of ammonia be neutral.    This test was first pointed out by Dr. Wollaston.    The presence of oxygen gas loosely combined in water may readily be  discovered in the following manner.      EXPERIMENT.    Fill a vial with water, and add to it a small quantity of green sulphate  of iron. If the water be entirely free of oxygen, and if the vessel be  well stopped and completely filled, the solution is transparent; but if  otherwise, it soon becomes slightly turbid, from the oxide of iron  attracting the oxygen, and a small portion of it, in this more highly  oxidated state, leaving the acid and being precipitated. Or, according  to a method pointed out by Driessen, the water is to be boiled for two  hours in a flask filled with it, and immersed in a vessel of water kept  boiling, with the mouth of the flask under the surface of the water: it  is to be inverted in quicksilver, taking care that no air-bubble adheres  to the side of the flask, and being tinged with infusion of litmus, a  little nitrous gas is to be introduced: if the oxygen gas has been  sufficiently expelled from the water, the purple colour of the litmus  does not change; while, if oxygen be present, it immediately becomes  red.[16]    If we examine the different waters which are used for the ordinary  purposes of life, and judge of them by the above tests, we shall find  them to differ considerably from each other. Some contain a large  quantity of saline and earthy matters, whilst others are nearly pure.  The differences are produced by the great solvent power which water  exercises upon most substances. Wells should never be lined with bricks,  which render soft water hard; or, if bricks be employed, they should be  bedded in and covered with cement.      METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE RELATIVE QUANTITY OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT  SUBSTANCES USUALLY CONTAINED IN COMMON WATER.    To ascertain the quantity of earthy and saline matter contained in  water, the following is the most simple and easy method.      EXPERIMENT.    Put any measured quantity of the water into a platina, or silver  evaporating basin, the weight of which is known, and evaporate the water  upon a steam bath, at a temperature of about 180 deg., nearly to dryness;  and, lastly, remove the basin to a sand bath, and let the mass be  evaporated to perfect dryness. The weight of the platina basin being  already known, we have only to weigh it carefully. When the solid saline  contents of the water is attached to it, the increase of weight gives  the quantity of solid matter contained in a given quantity of the water.      EXPERIMENT.    Pour upon the saline contents a quantity of distilled water equal to  that in which the obtained salts were originally dissolved. If the whole  saline matter become dissolved in this water, there is reason to believe  that the saline matter has not been altered during the evaporation of  the water. But if a portion remain undissolved, as is usually the case,  then we may conclude that some of the salts have mutually decomposed  each other, when brought into a concentrated state by the evaporation,  and that salts have been formed which did not originally exist in the  water before its evaporation.    We have already mentioned that almost the only salts contained in common  waters, are the carbonates, sulphates, and muriates, of soda, lime, and  magnesia; and sometimes a very minute portion of iron. Having determined  the different acids and bases present, in the manner stated at p. 49, we  may easily ascertain the relative weight of each.    The following formula suggested by Dr. Murray,[17] is fully as accurate  a means of analysing waters as any other, and it is easy of execution.  The weight of the saline ingredients of a given quantity of water being  determined, we may proceed to the accurate analysis of it in the  following manner.      EXPERIMENT.    Measure out a determinate volume of the water (as 500 or 1000 cubic  inches,) and evaporate it gradually, in an unglazed open vessel defended  from dust, to one third of its original bulk; then divide this  evaporated liquid into three equal portions.      EXPERIMENT.    Drop into the first portion, muriate of barytes; wash the precipitate,  collect it, dry it at a red heat upon platina foil, and weigh it; digest  it in nitric acid, dry it, and weigh it again. The loss of weight  indicates the quantity of carbonate of barytes which the precipitate  contained. The residual weight is sulphate of barytes; the carbonic acid  in the water is equivalent to 0,22 of the weight of the carbonate of  barytes; the sulphuric acid to 0,339 of the weight of the sulphate of  barytes.      EXPERIMENT.    Precipitate the second portion of the concentrated water, by the  addition of nitrate of silver; wash the precipitate, dry it, and fuse it  on a piece of foil platina, previously weighed. By weighing the foil  containing the fused chloride of silver, the weight of the precipitate  may be ascertained. The fourth part of this weight is equivalent to the  weight of the muriatic acid contained in the portion of water  precipitated.      EXPERIMENT.    Precipitate the third portion of the water by the addition of oxalate of  ammonia; wash and dry the precipitate; expose it to a red heat, on a  platina foil, or in a capsule of platina; pour on it some dilute  sulphuric acid; digest for some time, then evaporate to dryness, expose  the capsule to a pretty strong heat, and, lastly, weigh the sulphate of  lime thus produced: 0.453 of its weight indicate the quantity of lime in  the portion of water precipitated.      EXPERIMENT.    Add to the same third portion of the water thus freed from lime, a  portion of a solution of neutral carbonate of ammonia, and then add  phosphoric acid, drop by drop, as long as any precipitate falls down.  Wash the precipitate, dry it, and expose it to a red heat in a platina"]]]
