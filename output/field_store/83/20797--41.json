The fatigue that follows a continued attention of the mind to one object  is relieved by changing the subject of our thoughts; as the continued  movement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead. Whereas a  due exercise of the faculties of the mind strengthens and improves those  faculties, whether of imagination or recollection; as the exercise of our  limbs in dancing or fencing increases the strength and agility of the  muscles thus employed.    5. If the muscles of any limb are inflamed, they do not move without pain;  so when the retina is inflamed, its motions also are painful. Hence light  is as intolerable in this kind of ophthalmia, as pressure is to the finger  in the paronychia. In this disease the patients frequently dream of having  their eyes painfully dazzled; hence the idea of strong light is painful as  well as the reality. The first of these facts evinces that our perceptions  are motions of the organs of sense; and the latter, that our imaginations  are also motions of the same organs.    6. The organs of sense, like the moving muscles, are liable to become  benumbed, or less sensible, from compression. Thus, if any person on a  light day looks on a white wall, he may perceive the ramifications of the  optic artery, at every pulsation of it, represented by darker branches on  the white wall; which is evidently owing to its compressing the retina  during the diastole of the artery. Savage Nosolog.    7. The organs of sense and the moving muscles are alike liable to be  affected with palsy, as in the gutta serena, and in some cases of deafness;  and one side of the face has sometimes lost its power of sensation, but  retained its power of motion; other parts of the body have lost their  motions but retained their sensation, as in the common hemiplagia; and in  other instances both these powers have perished together.    8. In some convulsive diseases a delirium or insanity supervenes, and the  convulsions cease; and conversely the convulsions shall supervene, and the  delirium cease. Of this I have been a witness many times in a day in the  paroxysms of violent epilepsies; which evinces that one kind of delirium is  a convulsion of the organs of sense, and that our ideas are the motions of  these organs: the subsequent cases will illustrate this observation.    Miss G----, a fair young lady, with light eyes and hair, was seized with  most violent convulsions of her limbs, with outrageous hiccough, and most  vehement efforts to vomit: after near an hour was elapsed this tragedy  ceased, and a calm talkative delirium supervened for about another hour;  and these relieved each other at intervals during the greatest part of  three or four days. After having carefully considered this disease, I  thought the convulsions of her ideas less dangerous than those of her  muscles; and having in vain attempted to make any opiate continue in her  stomach, an ounce of laudanum was rubbed along the spine of her back, and a  dram of it was used as an enema; by this medicine a kind of drunken  delirium was continued many hours; and when it ceased the convulsions did  not return; and the lady continued well many years, except some lighter  relapses, which were relieved in the same manner.    Miss H----, an accomplished young lady, with light eyes and hair, was  seized with convulsions of her limbs, with hiccough, and efforts to vomit,  more violent than words can express; these continued near an hour, and were  succeeded with a cataleptic spasm of one arm, with the hand applied to her  head; and after about twenty minutes these spasms ceased, and a talkative  reverie supervened for near an other hour, from which no violence, which it  was proper to use, could awaken her. These periods of convulsions, first of  the muscles, and then of the ideas, returned twice a day for several weeks;  and were at length removed by great doses of opium, after a great variety  of other medicines and applications had been in vain experienced. This lady  was subject to frequent relapses, once or twice a year for many years, and  was as frequently relieved by the same method.    Miss W----, an elegant young lady, with black eyes and hair, had sometimes  a violent pain of her side, at other times a most painful strangury, which  were every day succeeded by delirium; which gave a temporary relief to the  painful spasms. After the vain exhibition of variety of medicines and  applications by different physicians, for more than a twelvemonth, she was  directed to take some doses of opium, which were gradually increased, by  which a drunken delirium was kept up for a day or two, and the pains  prevented from returning. A flesh diet, with a little wine or beer, instead  of the low regimen she had previously used, in a few weeks completely  established her health; which, except a few relapses, has continued for  many years.    9. Lastly, as we advance in life all the parts of the body become more  rigid, and are rendered less susceptible of new habits of motion, though  they retain those that were before established. This is sensibly observed  by those who apply themselves late in life to music, fencing, or any of the  mechanic arts. In the same manner many elderly people retain the ideas they  had learned early in life, but find great difficulty in acquiring new  trains of memory; insomuch that in extreme old age we frequently see a  forgetfulness of the business of yesterday, and at the same time a  circumstantial remembrance of the amusements of their youth; till at length  the ideas of recollection and activity of the body gradually cease  together,--such is the condition of humanity!--and nothing remains but the  vital motions and sensations.    VI. 1. In opposition to this doctrine of the production of our ideas, it  may be asked, if some of our ideas, like other animal motions, are  voluntary, why can we not invent new ones, that have not been received by  perception? The answer will be better understood after having perused the  succeeding section, where it will be explained, that the muscular motions  likewise are originally excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the  moving organ; and that the will has only the power of repeating the motions  thus excited.    2. Another objector may ask, Can the motion of an organ of sense resemble  an odour or a colour? To which I can only answer, that it has not been  demonstrated that any of our ideas resemble the objects that excite them;  it has generally been believed that they do not; but this shall be  discussed at large in Sect. XIV.    3. There is another objection that at first view would seem less easy to  surmount. After the amputation, of a foot or a finger, it has frequently  happened, that an injury being offered to the stump of the amputated limb,  whether from cold air, too great pressure, or other accidents, the patient  has complained, of a sensation of pain in the foot or finger, that was cut  off. Does not this evince that all our ideas are excited in the brain, and  not in the organs of sense? This objection is answered, by observing that  our ideas of the shape, place, and solidity of our limbs, are acquired by  our organs of touch and of sight, which are situated in our fingers and  eyes, and not by any sensations in the limb itself.    In this case the pain or sensation, which formerly has arisen in the foot  or toes, and been propagated along the nerves to the central part of the  sensorium, was at the same time accompanied with a visible idea of the  shape and place, and with a tangible idea of the solidity of the affected  limb: now when these nerves are afterwards affected by any injury done to  the remaining stump with a similar degree or kind of pain, the ideas of the  shape, place, or solidity of the lost limb, return by association; as these  ideas belong to the organs of sight and touch, on which they were first  excited.    4. If you wonder what organs of sense can be excited into motion, when you  call up the ideas of wisdom or benevolence, which Mr. Locke has termed  abstracted ideas; I ask you by what organs of sense you first became  acquainted with these ideas? And the answer will be reciprocal; for it is  certain that all our ideas were originally acquired by our organs of sense;  for whatever excites our perception must be external to the organ that  perceives it, and we have no other inlets to knowledge but by our  perceptions: as will be further explained in Section XIV. and XV. on the  Productions and Classes of Ideas.    VII. If our recollection or imagination be not a repetition of animal  movements, I ask, in my turn, What is it? You tell me it consists of images  or pictures of things. Where is this extensive canvas hung up? or where are  the numerous receptacles in which those are deposited? or to what else in  the animal system have they any similitude?    That pleasing picture of objects, represented in miniature on the retina of  the eye, seems to have given rise to this illusive oratory! It was forgot  that this representation belongs rather to the laws of light, than to those  of life; and may with equal elegance be seen in the camera obscura as in  the eye; and that the picture vanishes for ever, when the object is  withdrawn.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT.

The fibres, which constitute the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15709"],[0,"The Christmas Angel (#6)"],[1,"began to coo softly to it.    \"Bah Jove!\" repeated Cooper. \"Fahncy caring so much about anything! Poor  kid! Perhaps that is all the Christmas he will have.\" He blew a thoughtful  puff through his nose. \"Christmas Eve!\" The thought flashed through his  mind with a new appeal.    Just then came a sudden \"_Honk, honk!_\" An automobile had turned the corner  and was coming up at full speed. It was the same machine which had passed a  few minutes earlier in the opposite direction.    \"Hi there!\" Cooper yelled to the child. But the latter was sitting in the  snow in the middle of the street, rocking back and forth, with the Flanton  Dog in his arms. There was scarcely time for action. Bob dropped his  cigarette and his cane, made one leap into the street and another to the  child, and by the impact of his body threw the baby into the drift at the  curb. With a horrified _honk_ the automobile passed over the young man, who  lay senseless in the snow.    [Illustration: BOB COOPER SAVES THE BABY]    He was not killed. Miss Terry saw him taken to his home close by, where his  broken leg was set and his bruises attended to. She saw him lying bandaged  and white on his bed when the woman and her child were brought to see him.  Johnnie was still clasping closely the unlucky Flanton Dog.    \"Well, Kid,\" said the young man feebly, \"so you saved the dog, after all.\"    \"O sir!\" cried the poor woman, weeping. \"Only to think that he would not  be here now but for you. What a Christmas that would have been for me! You  were so good, so brave!\"    \"Oh, rot!\" protested Bob faintly. \"Had to do it; my fault anyway; Christmas  Eve,--couldn't see a kid hurt on Christmas Eve.\"    He called the attendant and asked for the pocket-book which had been in his  coat at the time of the accident. Putting it into the woman's hand, he  said, \"Good-by. Get Johnnie something really jolly for Christmas. I'm  afraid the dog is about all in. Get him a new one.\"    But Johnnie refused to have a new dog. It was the poor, shapeless Flanton  animal which remained the darling of his heart for many a moon.           *       *       *       *       *    All this of past and future Miss Terry knew through the Angel's power. When  once more the library lightened, and she saw the pink figure smiling at her  from the mantel, she spoke of her own accord.    \"It was my fault, because I put the dog in the way. I caused all that  trouble.\"    \"Trouble?\" said the Angel, puzzled. \"Do you call it _trouble?_ Do you not  see what it has done for that heartless youth? It brought his good moment.  Perhaps he will be a different man after this. And as for the child; he was  made happy by something that would otherwise have been wasted, and he has  gained a friend who will not forget him. Trouble! And do you think _you_  did it?\" He laughed knowingly.    \"I certainly did,\" said Miss Terry firmly.    \"But it was I, yes _I_, the Christmas Spirit, who put it into your head to  do what you did. You may not believe it, but so it was. You too, even you,  Angelina, could not quite escape the influence of the Christmas Spirit, and  so these things have happened. But now let us see what became of the third  experiment.\"          CHAPTER X    NOAH AGAIN      In the street of candles a woman dressed all in black had picked up the  poor old Noah's ark and was looking at it wildly. She was a widow who had  just lost her only child, a little son, and she was in a state of morbid  bitterness bordering on distraction.    When the second woman with the two little ones came up and begged for the  toy, something hard and sullen and cruel rose in the widow's heart, and she  refused angrily to give up the thing. She hated those two boys who had been  spared when her own was taken. She would not make them happy.    \"No, you shall not have it,\" she cried, clutching the Noah's ark fiercely.  \"I will destroy it.\"    The poor woman and the children followed her wistfully. The little boys  were crying. They were cold and hungry and disappointed. They had come so  near to something pleasant. They had almost been lucky; but the luck had  passed over their heads to another.    The woman in mourning strode on rapidly, the thoughts within her no less  black than the garments which she wore. She hated the world; she hated the  people who lived in it. She hated Christmas time, when every one seemed  merry except herself. And yes, yes! Most of all she hated children. She  clenched her teeth wickedly; her mind reeled.    Suddenly, somewhere, a chorus of happy voices began to sing the words of an  old carol:--        \"Holy night! Peaceful night!      All is dark save the light,      Yonder where they sweet vigil keep,      O'er the Babe who in silent sleep        Rests in heavenly peace.\"    Softly and sweetly the childish voices ascended from the street. The woman  in black stopped short, breathing hard. She saw the band of choristers  standing in a group on the sidewalk and in the snow, their hats pulled down  over their eyes, their collars turned up around their ears, their hands  deep in pockets. In their midst rose the tall wooden cross carried by a  little fellow with yellow hair. They sang as simply and as heartily as a  flock of birds out in the snow.    The woman gave a great sob. Her little lad had been a choir boy,--perhaps  these were his one-time comrades. The second verse of the carol rang out  sweetly:--        \"Holy night! Peaceful night!      Only for shepherds' sight      Came blest visions of angel throngs,      With their loud Hallelujah songs,        Saying, Jesus is come!\"    Suddenly it seemed to the distracted mother that her own boy's voice  blended with those others. He too was singing in honor of that Child. Happy  and ever young, he was bidding her rejoice in the day which made all  childhood sacred. And for his sake she had been hating children!    With a sudden revulsion of feeling she turned to see what had become of the  poor mother and her boys. They were not far behind, huddling in the shadow.  The black woman strode quickly up to them. They shrank pitifully at her  approach, and she felt the shame of it. They were afraid of her!    \"Here,\" she said, thrusting the Noah's ark into the hands of the larger  boy. \"Take it. It belongs to you.\"    The child took it timidly. The mother began to protest thanks. Trying to  control the shake in her voice the dark lady spoke again. \"Have you  prepared a Christmas for your children?\"    The woman shook her head. \"I have nothing,\" she sighed. \"A roof over our  heads, that's all.\"    \"Your husband?\"    \"My man died a month ago.\"    So other folk had raw sorrows, too. The mourner had forgotten that.    \"There is no one expecting you at home?\" Again the woman shook her head  dolefully. \"Come with me,\" said the dark lady impulsively. \"You shall be my  guests to-night. And to-morrow I will make a Christmas for the children.  The house shall put off its shadow. I too will light candles. I have  toys,\"--her voice broke,--\"and clothing; many things, which are being  wasted. That is not right! Something led you to me, or me to you;  something,--perhaps it was an Angel,--whoever dropped that Noah's ark in  the street. An Angel might do that, I believe. Come with me.\"    The woman and her sons followed her, rejoicing greatly in the midst of  their wonder.           *       *       *       *       *    There were tears in the eyes through which Miss Terry saw once more the  Christmas Angel. She wiped them hastily. But still the Angel seemed to  shine with a fairer radiance.    \"You see!\" was all he said. And Miss Terry bowed her head. She began to  understand.          CHAPTER XI    MIRANDA AGAIN      Once more, on the wings of vision, Miss Terry was out in the snowy street.  She was following the fleet steps of a little girl who carried a  white-paper package under her arm. Miss Terry knew that she was learning  the fate of her old doll, Miranda, whom her own hands had thrust out into a  cold world.    Poor Miranda! After all these years to become the property of a thief! Mary  was the little thief's name. Hugging the tempting package close, Mary ran  and ran until she was out of breath. Her one thought was to get as far as  possible from the place where the bundle had lain. For she suspected that  the steps where she had found it led up to the doll's home. That was why in  her own eyes also she was a little thief. But now she had run so far and  had turned so many corners that she could not find her way back if she  would. There was triumph in the thought. Mary chuckled to herself as she  stopped running and began to walk leisurely in the neighborhood with which  she was more familiar.    She pinched the package gently. Yes, there could be no doubt about it. It  was a doll,--not a very large doll; but Mary reflected that she had never  thought she should care for a large doll. Undoubtedly it was a very nice  one. Had she not found it in a swell part of the city, on the steps of a  swell-looking house? Mary gloated over the doll as she fancied it; with  real hair, and eyes that opened and shut; with four little white teeth, and  hands with dimples in the knuckles. She had seen such dolls in the windows  of the big shops. But she had never hoped to have one for her very own.    \"Maybe it will have on a blue silk dress and white kid shoes, like that one  I saw this morning!\" she mused rapturously.    She pinched the spot where she fancied the doll's feet ought to be.    \"Yes, she's got shoes, sure enough! I bet they're white, too. They _feel_  white. Oh, what fun I shall have with her,\"--she hugged the doll  fondly,--\"if Uncle and Aunt don't take her away!\"    The sudden thought made her stand still in horror. \"They sold Mother's  little clock for rum,\" she said bitterly. \"They sold the ring with the red  stone that Father gave me on my birthday when I was seven. They sold the  presents that I got at Sunday School last year. Oh, wouldn't it be"]]]
