It is a curious illustration of the  uncertainty which attends all the early records of national history,  that, notwithstanding all the above particularity respecting the life  and death of Arthur, it is a serious matter of dispute among the  learned in modern times whether any such person ever lived.    [Footnote 1: Spelled sometimes Gwenlyfar and Ginevra.]          CHAPTER III.    THE DANES.      The landing of Hengist and Horsa, the first of the Anglo-Saxons, took  place in the year 449, according to the commonly received chronology.  It was more than two hundred years after this before the Britons were  entirely subdued, and the Saxon authority established throughout the  island, unquestioned and supreme. One or two centuries more passed  away, and then the Anglo-Saxons had, in their turn, to resist a new  horde of invaders, who came, as they themselves had done, across the  German Ocean. These new invaders were the Danes.    The Saxons were not united under one general government when they came  finally to get settled in their civil polity. The English territory  was divided, on the contrary, into seven or eight separate kingdoms.  These kingdoms were ruled by as many separate dynasties, or lines of  kings. They were connected with each other by friendly relations and  alliances, more or less intimate, the whole system being known in  history by the name of the Saxon Heptarchy.    The princes of these various dynasties showed in their dealings with  one another, and in their relations with foreign powers, the same  characteristics of boldness and energy as had always marked the action  of the race. Even the queens and princesses evinced, by their courage  and decision, that Anglo-Saxon blood lost nothing of its inherent  qualities by flowing in female veins.    For example, a very extraordinary story is told of one of these Saxon  princesses. A certain king upon the Continent, whose dominions lay  between the Rhine and the German Ocean, had proposed for her hand in  behalf of his son, whose name was Radiger. The consent of the princess  was given, and the contract closed. The king himself soon afterward  died, but before he died he changed his mind in respect to the  marriage of his son. It seems that he had himself married a second  wife, the daughter of a king of the Franks, a powerful continental  people; and as, in consequence of his own approaching death, his son  would come unexpectedly into possession of the throne, and would need  immediately all the support which a powerful alliance could give him,  he recommended to him to give up the Saxon princess, and connect  himself, instead, with the Franks, as he himself had done. The  prince entered into these views; his father died, and he immediately  afterward married his father's youthful widow--his own step-mother--a  union which, however monstrous it would be regarded in our day, seems  not to have been considered any thing very extraordinary then.    The Anglo-Saxon princess was very indignant at this violation of his  plighted faith on the part of her suitor. She raised an army and  equipped a fleet, and set sail with the force which she had thus  assembled across the German Ocean, to call the faithless Radiger to  account. Her fleet entered the mouth of the Rhine, and her troops  landed, herself at the head of them. She then divided her army into  two portions, keeping one division as a guard for herself at her own  encampment, which she established near the place of her landing, while  she sent the other portion to seek and attack Radiger, who was, in the  mean time, assembling his forces, in a state of great alarm at this  sudden and unexpected danger.    In due time this division returned, reporting that they had met and  encountered Radiger, and had entirely defeated him. They came back  triumphing in their victory, considering evidently, that the faithless  lover had been well punished for his offense. The princess, however,  instead of sharing in their satisfaction, ordered them to make a  new incursion into the interior, and not to return without bringing  Radiger with them as their prisoner. They did so; and after hunting  the defeated and distressed king from place to place, they succeeded,  at last, in seizing him in a wood, and brought him in to the  princess's encampment. He began to plead for his life, and to make  excuses for the violation of his contract by urging the necessities of  his situation and his father's dying commands. The princess said she  was ready to forgive him if he would now dismiss her rival and fulfill  his obligations to her. Radiger yielded to this demand; he repudiated  his Frank wife, and married the Anglo-Saxon lady in her stead.    Though the Anglo-Saxon race continued thus to evince in all their  transactions the same extraordinary spirit and energy, and met  generally with the same success that had characterized them at the  beginning, they seemed at length to find their equals in the Danes.  These Danes, however, though generally designated by that appellation  in history, were not exclusively the natives of Denmark. They came  from all the shores of the Northern and Baltic Seas. In fact, they  inhabited the sea rather than the land. They were a race of bold and  fierce naval adventurers, as the Anglo-Saxons themselves had been  two centuries before. Most extraordinary accounts are given of their  hardihood, and of their fierce and predatory habits. They haunted the  bays along the coasts of Sweden and Norway, and the islands which  encumber the entrance to the Baltic Sea. They were banded together in  great hordes, each ruled by a chieftain, who was called a _sea king_,  because his dominions scarcely extended at all to the land. His  possessions, his power, his subjects pertained all to the sea. It is  true they built or bought their vessels on the shore, and they sought  shelter among the islands and in the bays in tempests and storms; but  they prided themselves in never dwelling in houses, or sharing, in  any way, the comforts or enjoyments of the land. They made excursions  every where for conquest and plunder, and were proud of their  successful deeds of violence and wrong. It was honorable to enter into  their service. Chieftains and nobles who dwelt upon the land sent  their sons to acquire greatness, and wealth, and fame by joining these  piratical gangs, just as high-minded military or naval officers, in  modern times, would enter into the service of an honorable government  abroad.    Besides the great leaders of the most powerful of these bands, there  was an infinite number of petty chieftains, who commanded single ships  or small detached squadrons. These were generally the younger sons of  sovereigns or chieftains who lived upon the land, the elder brothers  remaining at home to inherit the throne or the paternal inheritance.  It was discreditable then, as it is now in Europe, for any branches  of families of the higher class to engage in any pursuit of honorable  industry. They could plunder and kill without dishonor, but they could  not toil. To rob and murder was glory; to do good or to be useful in  any way was disgrace.    These younger sons went to sea at a very early age too. They were  sent often at twelve, that they might become early habituated to the  exposures and dangers of their dreadful combats, and of the wintery  storms, and inured to the athletic exertions which the sea rigorously  exacts of all who venture within her dominion. When they returned  they were received with consideration and honor, or with neglect and  disgrace, according as they were more or less laden with booty and  spoil. In the summer months the land kings themselves would organize  and equip naval armaments for similar expeditions. They would cruise  along the coasts of the sea, to land where they found an unguarded  point, and sack a town or burn a castle, seize treasures, capture men  and make them slaves, kidnap women, and sometimes destroy helpless  children with their spears in a manner too barbarous and horrid to be  described. On returning to their homes, they would perhaps find their  own castles burned and their own dwellings roofless, from the visit of  some similar horde.    Thus the seas of western Europe were covered in those days, as they  are now, with fleets of shipping; though, instead of being engaged as  now, in the quiet and peaceful pursuits of commerce, freighted with  merchandise, manned with harmless seamen, and welcome wherever they  come, they were then loaded only with ammunition and arms, and crowded  with fierce and reckless robbers, the objects of universal detestation  and terror.    One of the first of these sea kings who acquired sufficient individual  distinction to be personally remembered in history has given a sort of  immortality, by his exploits, to the very rude name of Ragnar Lodbrog,  and his character was as rude as his name.    [Illustration: THE SEA KINGS]    Ragnar's father was a prince of Norway. He married, however, a Danish  princess, and thus Ragnar acquired a sort of hereditary right to  a Danish kingdom--the territory including various islands and  promontories at the entrance of the Baltic Sea. There was, however, a  competitor for this power, named Harald. The Franks made common cause  with Harald. Ragnar was defeated and driven away from the land. Though  defeated, however, he was not subdued. He organized a naval force, and  made himself a sea king. His operations on the stormy element of the  seas were conducted with so much decision and energy, and at the same  time with so much system and plan, that his power rapidly extended. He  brought the other sea kings under his control, and established quite  a maritime empire. He made more and more distant excursions, and  at last, in order to avenge himself upon the Franks for their  interposition in behalf of his enemy at home, he passed through the  Straits of Dover, and thence"]]]
