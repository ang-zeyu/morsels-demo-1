FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATION.    1. My lungs are the bellows or breathing machines of my body.    2. They are composed of a soft, fleshy substance, full of small air-cells  and tubes. They are porous and spongy when healthy, but in some diseases  become an almost solid mass, through which the air cannot pass.    3. I breathe by drawing the air through my windpipe, along the tubes into  the cells of my lungs, swelling them out, and causing my chest to expand;  then the chest contracts, and the impure vapor in my lungs is pressed out  through the same tubes, windpipe, nose, and mouth, into the atmosphere.    4. I cannot live without breathing, because if the air does not go down  into my lungs, the dark blood in them is not changed into pure red blood,  and goes back through my body dark blood, which cannot keep me alive.    5. If I would have healthy lungs,      I must breathe pure air,      I must live in the sunlight,      I must keep my body clean,      I must wear loose clothing,      I must wear clean clothing,      I must sit and stand erect,      I must keep all parts of my body warm,      I must not change my winter clothing too early in the spring,      I must avoid draughts of cool air,      I must not rush into the cold when I am in a perspiration,      I must not poison my lungs with alcohol or tobacco.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. What are the lungs?    2. Describe the lungs.    3. How do you breathe?    4. Why can you not live without breathing?    5. What is necessary if you would have healthy lungs?           *       *       *       *       *    THE AIR AND THE LUNGS.    The air which enters through the nose and mouth passes into a tube of  muscles and ring-like pieces of cartilage. The upper part of this tube is  the voice-box or _larynx_, covered by a spoon-shaped lid which closes when  we swallow; the lower part is the _trachea_, and the two parts are the  windpipe. The trachea divides into two branches, _the bronchial tubes_, one  for each lung. These tubes divide again and again like the branches of a  tree, and end in exceedingly small sacs or bags. The air in these sacs, or  air-cells, gives _oxygen_ to the blood in the tiny blood-vessels of the  lungs and takes from them the poison, _carbonic-acid gas_, water, and  impurities, which it carries back through the windpipe into the outside  air.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATION.    Of what are the lungs composed?--\"Of a soft, fleshy substance, full of  small air-cells and tubes.\"    Of what use are the lungs?--\"They are the breathing machines of the body.\"    How do the lungs appear when healthy?--\"Porous and spongy.\"    How does the air get into the lungs?--\"The air flows through the nose and  mouth, into the windpipe and along the air-tubes, into the air-cells of the  lungs.\"    What does the air do in the lungs?--\"It swells the lungs and causes the  chest to expand.\"    What do you mean by expand?--\"To increase in size.\"    How is the air expelled from the lungs?--\"The chest contracts and sends  the impure air through the tubes and windpipe, the nose and mouth, into the  atmosphere.\"    What do you mean by contracts?--\"Becomes smaller.\"    What do you mean by atmosphere?--\"The air.\"    Of what use is the air when it is in the lungs?--\"It makes the blood pure.\"    Why can you not live without breathing?--\"Because, if I do not breathe,  pure air cannot get into the lungs to make the bad blood pure, and I cannot  live if the dark, impure blood is sent back again through my body.\"    Why must you live in the sunlight?--\"Because the sunlight helps to purify  the blood and strengthen the body.\"    Why must you wear loose clothing?--\"Because tight clothing stops the  circulation of the blood.\"    Why must you avoid tight-lacing?--\"Because tight-lacing crowds the ribs  against the lungs, so that the lungs cannot move freely.\"    Why should you wear clean clothing?--\"That nothing impure may pass into the  body through the pores of the skin.\"    Why should you keep the body clean?--\"That the pores of the skin may not be  closed, but remain open to let the perspiration pass through.\"    What has the cleanliness of the body to do with the health of the  lungs?--\"If the body is not kept clean, the perspiratory pores become  clogged.\"    What happens when the perspiratory pores are clogged?--\"The impure  particles which should pass through them stay in the body, and cause  disease in the lungs or other parts.\"    Why should you sit and stand erect?--\"Because, if I am in the habit of  stooping, my lungs will be crowded, and will not have enough room to move  freely.\"    Why should you keep all parts of the body warm?--\"Because chilling any part  of the body causes the blood to chill in that part, and thus hinders its  circulation.\"    Why should you not change your winter clothing too early in the spring of  the year?--\"I may take cold if not warmly clothed during the cool days of  early spring.\"    Why should you avoid draughts of cool air?--\"Because the cool air blows  upon some parts of the body and closes the pores of the skin, checking the  perspiration, and hindering the circulation of the blood.\"    Why should you not rush suddenly from a warm to a cool place?--\"Because  when warm the pores of the skin are open; if I rush suddenly into the cool  air, these pores are closed too quickly.\"    Why does stopping the perspiration hurt the lungs more or less?--\"The  impurities it ought to carry away remain in the body, make the blood  impure, and produce disease in some part; very often that part is the  lungs.\"    What harm does alcohol do in the lungs?--\"It fills the lungs with impure  blood.\"    What harm does it do to the air-cells?--\"It hardens the walls of the  air-cells of the lungs.\"    What harm is done by the hardening of these air-cells?--\"1. The lungs  cannot take in enough of the gas called oxygen to purify the blood  perfectly. 2. The gases or vapors in the lungs cannot pass freely through  the hardened air-cells.\"    What happens from this?--\"The lungs become diseased.\"    From what disease do some hard drinkers suffer?--\"Alcoholic consumption,  for which there is no cure.\" See Appendices on Alcohol and Tobacco.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.]      1.

Her fine face lighted at the  thought, and her last words to us were, as she held open the little iron  wicket. \"I have a great desire to go to your country again; perhaps, in  a year or two--who knows--I may be able to do it.\"    She stood there, a noble, commanding figure, framed in the green of her  garden, and waved her handkerchief, till our cab turned a corner, and  she was lost to our view.      THE MOZART FESTIVAL    Several years later, a year before the world war started, to be exact,  we had the pleasure of meeting the artist again, and this time, of  hearing her sing.    It was the occasion of the Mozart Festival in Salzburg. It is well known  that Lehmann, devoted as she has always been to the genius of Mozart,  and one of the greatest interpreters of his music, had thrown her whole  energy into the founding of a suitable memorial to the master in his  native city. This memorial was to consist of a large music school, a  concert hall and home for opera. The Mozarteum was not yet completed,  but a Festival was held each year in Salzburg, to aid the project.  Madame Lehmann was always present and sang on these occasions.    We timed our visit to Mozart's birthplace, so that we should be able to  attend the Festival, which lasted as usual five days. The concerts were  held in the Aula Academica, a fine Saal in the old picturesque quarter  of the city.    At the opening concert, Lehmann sang a long, difficult Concert Aria of  Mozart. We could not help wondering, before she began, how time had  treated this great organ; whether we should be able to recognize the  famous Lehmann who had formerly taken such high rank as singer and  interpreter in America. We need not have feared that the voice had  become impaired. Or, if it had been, it had become rejuvenated on this  occasion. Mme. Lehmann sang with all her well-remembered power and  fervor, all her exaltation of spirit, and of course she had a great  ovation at the close. She looked like a queen in ivory satin and rare  old lace, with jewels on neck, arms and in her silver hair. In the  auditorium, three arm chairs had been placed in front of the platform.  The Arch-duke, Prince Eugen, the royal patron of the Festival, occupied  one. When Madame Lehmann had finished her Aria, she stepped down from  the platform. The Prince rose at once and went to meet her. She gave him  her hand with a graceful curtesy and he led her to the armchair next his  own, which had evidently been placed in position for her special use.    At the close of the concert we had a brief chat with her. The next day  she was present at the morning concert. This time she was gowned in  black, with an ermine cape thrown over her shoulders. The Arch-duke sat  beside her in the arm chair, as he had done the evening before. We had a  bow and smile as she passed down the aisle.    We trust the Mozarteum in Salzburg, for which Mme. Lehmann has labored  with such devotion, will one day fulfill its noble mission.      LEHMANN THE TEACHER    As a teacher of the art of singing Madame Lehmann has long been a  recognized authority, and many artists now actively before the public,  have come from under her capable hands. Her book, \"How to  Sing,\"--rendered in English by Richard Aldrich--(Macmillan) has  illumined the path, for many a serious student who seeks light on that  strange, wonderful, hidden instrument--the voice. Madame Lehmann, by  means of many explanations and numerous plates, endeavors to make clear  to the young student how to begin and how to proceed in her vocal  studies.      BREATHING    On the important subject of breathing she says: \"No one can sing  without preparing for it mentally and physically. It is not enough to  sing well, one must know how one does it. I practice many breathing  exercises without using tone. Breath becomes voice through effort of  will and by use of vocal organs. When singing emit the smallest quantity  of breath. Vocal chords are breath regulators; relieve them of all  overwork.    \"At the start a young voice should be taught to begin in the middle and  work both ways--that is, up and down. A tone should never be forced.  Begin piano, make a long crescendo and return to piano. Another exercise  employs two connecting half tones, using one or two vowels. During  practice stand before a mirror, that one may see what one is doing.  Practice about one hour daily. Better that amount each day than ten  hours one day and none the next. The test will be; do you feel rested  and ready for work each morning? If not you have done too much the day  before.\"      REGISTERS    In regard to registers Madame Lehmann has this to say: \"In the formation  of the voice no registers should exist or be created. As long as the  word is kept in use, registers will not disappear.\"      PHYSIOLOGY    In spite of the fact there are many drawings and plates illustrating the  various organs of head and throat which are used in singing, Madame  Lehmann says:    \"The singer is often worried about questions of physiology, whereas she  need--must--know little about it.      THE NASAL QUALITY    \"The singer must have some nasal quality, otherwise the voice sounds  colorless and expressionless. We must sing toward the nose: (not  necessarily through the nose).    \"For many ills of the voice and tone production, I use long, slow  scales. They are an infallible cure.      USE OF THE LIPS    \"The lips play a large part in producing variety of tone quality. Each  vowel, every word can be colored, as by magic, by well controlled play  of the lips. When lips are stiff and unresponsive, the singing is  colorless. Lips are final resonators, through which tones must pass,  and lip movements can be varied in every conceivable manner.\"      POWER AND VELOCITY    She humorously writes: \"Singers without power and velocity are like  horses without tails. For velocity, practice figures of five, six, seven  and eight notes, first slowly, then faster and faster, up and down.\"          V    =AMELITA GALLI-CURCI=    SELF-TEACHING THE GREAT ESSENTIAL      No singer can rise to any distinction without the severest kind of  self-discipline and hard work. This is the testimony of all the great  vocalists of our time--of any time. This is the message they send back  from the mountain top of victory to the younger ones who are striving to  acquire the mastery they have achieved. Work, work and again--work! And  if you have gained even a slight foothold on the hill of fame, then work  to keep your place. Above all, be not satisfied with your present  progress,--strive for more perfection. There are heights you have not  gained--higher up! There are joys for you--higher up, if you will but  labor to reach them.    [Illustration: _Photo by De Strelecki, N.Y._ AMELITA GALLI-CURCI]    Perhaps there is no singer who more thoroughly believes in the gospel of  work, and surely not one who more consistently practices what she  preaches, than Amelita Galli-Curci. She knows the value of work, and she  loves it for its own sake. There is no long cessation for her, during  summer months, \"to rest her voice.\" There is no half-day seclusion after  a performance, to recover from the fatigue of singing a role the night  before. No, for her this event does not spell exhaustion but happiness,  exhilaration. It is a pleasure to sing because it is not wearisome--it  is a part of herself. And she enjoys the doing! Thus it happens that the  morning after a performance, she is up and abroad betimes, ready to  attend personally to the many calls upon her time and attention. She can  use her speaking voice without fear, because she has never done anything  to strain it; she is usually strong and well, buoyant and bright. Those  soft, dark eyes are wells of intelligent thinking; the mouth smiles  engagingly as she speaks; the slight figure is full of life and energy.  Yet there is a deep sense of calm in her presence. A brave, bright  spirit; a great, wonderful artist!    These thoughts faintly glimpse my first impression of Mme. Galli-Curci,  as she entered her big, sunny parlor, where I was waiting to see her.  Her delicate, oval face was aglow with the flush of healthful exercise,  for she had just come in from a shopping expedition and the wintry air  was keen. \"I love to go shopping,\" she explained, \"so I always do it  myself.\"    She bade me sit beside her on a comfortable divan, and at once began to  speak of the things I most wished to hear.    \"I am often asked,\" she began, \"to describe how I create this or that  effect, how I produce such and such tones, how I make the voice float to  the farthest corner, and so on. I answer, that is my secret. In reality  it is no secret at all, at least not to any one who has solved the  problem. Any one possessing a voice and intelligence, can acquire these  things, who knows how to go to work to get them. But if one has no  notion of the process, no amount of mere talking will make it plain.  Singing an opera role seems such an easy thing from the other side of  the footlights. People seem to think, if you only know how to sing, it  is perfectly natural and easy for you to impersonate a great lyric role.  And the more mastery you have, the easier they think it is to do it. The  real truth of the matter is that it requires years and years of  study--constant study, to learn how to sing, before attempting a big  part in opera.    \"There are so many organs of the body that are concerned in the process  of breathing and tone production; and most of these organs must be, if  not always, yet much of the time, relaxed and in an easy pliable  condition when you sing. There is the diaphragm--then the throat,  larynx, the lungs, nose, lips--all of them help to make the tone.  Perhaps I might say the larynx is the most important factor of all. If  you can manage that, you have the secret. But no human being can tell  you exactly how to do it. Some singers before"]]]
