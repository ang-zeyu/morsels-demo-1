'You can run and jump about where you like on those big glittering  plains. The Snow Queen has her summer tent there, but her permanent  castle is up at the North Pole, on the island which is called  Spitzbergen!'    'Oh Kay, little Kay!' sighed Gerda.    'Lie still, or I shall stick the knife into you!' said the robber girl.    In the morning Gerda told her all that the wood pigeons had said, and  the little robber girl looked quite solemn, but she nodded her head and  said, 'No matter, no matter! Do you know where Lapland is?' she asked  the reindeer.    'Who should know better than I,' said the animal, its eyes dancing. 'I  was born and brought up there, and I used to leap about on the  snowfields.'    'Listen,' said the robber girl. 'You see that all our men folks are  away, but mother is still here, and she will stay; but later on in the  morning she will take a drink out of the big bottle there, and after  that she will have a nap--then I will do something for you.' Then she  jumped out of bed, ran along to her mother and pulled her beard, and  said, 'Good morning, my own dear nanny-goat!' And her mother filliped  her nose till it was red and blue; but it was all affection.    As soon as her mother had had her draught from the bottle and had  dropped asleep, the little robber girl went along to the reindeer, and  said, 'I should have the greatest pleasure in the world in keeping you  here, to tickle you with my knife, because you are such fun then;  however, it does not matter. I will untie your halter and help you  outside so that you may run away to Lapland, but you must put your best  foot foremost, and take this little girl for me to the Snow Queen's  palace, where her playfellow is. I have no doubt you heard what she was  telling me, for she spoke loud enough, and you are generally  eavesdropping!'    The reindeer jumped into the air for joy. The robber girl lifted little  Gerda up, and had the forethought to tie her on, nay, even to give her a  little cushion to sit upon. 'Here, after all, I will give you your fur  boots back, for it will be very cold, but I will keep your muff, it is  too pretty to part with. Still you shan't be cold. Here are my mother's  big mittens for you, they will reach up to your elbows; here, stick your  hands in! Now your hands look just like my nasty mother's!'    Gerda shed tears of joy.    'I don't like you to whimper!' said the little robber girl. 'You ought  to be looking delighted; and here are two loaves and a ham for you, so  that you shan't starve.'    These things were tied on to the back of the reindeer; the little robber  girl opened the door, called in all the big dogs, and then she cut the  halter with her knife, and said to the reindeer, 'Now run, but take care  of my little girl!'    Gerda stretched out her hands in the big mittens to the robber girl and  said good-bye; and then the reindeer darted off over briars and bushes,  through the big wood, over swamps and plains, as fast as it could go.  The wolves howled and the ravens screamed, while the red lights quivered  up in the sky.    'There are my old northern lights,' said the reindeer; 'see how they  flash!' and on it rushed faster than ever, day and night. The loaves  were eaten, and the ham too, and then they were in Lapland.      SIXTH STORY    THE LAPP WOMAN AND THE FINN WOMAN    [Illustration: _The reindeer did not dare to stop. It ran on till it  came to the bush with the red berries. There it put Gerda down, and  kissed her on the mouth, while big shining tears trickled down its  face._]    They stopped by a little hut, a very poverty-stricken one; the roof  sloped right down to the ground, and the door was so low that the people  had to creep on hands and knees when they wanted to go in or out. There  was nobody at home here but an old Lapp woman, who was frying fish over  a train-oil lamp. The reindeer told her all Gerda's story, but it told  its own first; for it thought it was much the most important. Gerda was  so overcome by the cold that she could not speak at all.    'Oh, you poor creatures!' said the Lapp woman; 'you've got a long way  to go yet; you will have to go hundreds of miles into Finmark, for the  Snow Queen is paying a country visit there, and she burns blue lights  every night. I will write a few words on a dried stock-fish, for I have  no paper. I will give it to you to take to the Finn woman up there. She  will be better able to direct you than I can.'    So when Gerda was warmed, and had eaten and drunk something, the Lapp  woman wrote a few words on a dried stock-fish and gave it to her,  bidding her take good care of it. Then she tied her on to the reindeer  again, and off they flew. Flicker, flicker, went the beautiful blue  northern lights up in the sky all night long;--at last they came to  Finmark, and knocked on the Finn woman's chimney, for she had no door at  all.    There was such a heat inside that the Finn woman went about almost  naked; she was little and very grubby. She at once loosened Gerda's  things, and took off the mittens and the boots, or she would have been  too hot. Then she put a piece of ice on the reindeer's head, and after  that she read what was written on the stock-fish. She read it three  times, and then she knew it by heart, and put the fish into the pot for  dinner; there was no reason why it should not be eaten, and she never  wasted anything.    Again the reindeer told his own story first, and then little Gerda's.  The Finn woman blinked with her wise eyes, but she said nothing.    'You are so clever,' said the reindeer, 'I know you can bind all the  winds of the world with a bit of sewing cotton. When a skipper unties  one knot he gets a good wind, when he unties two it blows hard, and if  he undoes the third and the fourth he brings a storm about his head wild  enough to blow down the forest trees. Won't you give the little girl a  drink, so that she may have the strength of twelve men to overcome the  Snow Queen?'    'The strength of twelve men,' said the Finn woman. 'Yes, that will be  about enough.'    She went along to a shelf and took down a big folded skin, which she  unrolled. There were curious characters written on it, and the Finn  woman read till the perspiration poured down her forehead.    But the reindeer again implored her to give Gerda something, and Gerda  looked at her with such beseeching eyes, full of tears, that the Finn  woman began blinking again, and drew the reindeer along into a corner,  where she whispered to it, at the same time putting fresh ice on its  head.    'Little Kay is certainly with the Snow Queen, and he is delighted with  everything there. He thinks it is the best place in the world, but that  is because he has got a splinter of glass in his heart and a grain of  glass in his eye. They will have to come out first, or he will never be  human again, and the Snow Queen will keep him in her power!'    'But can't you give little Gerda something to take which will give her  power to conquer it all?'    'I can't give her greater power than she already has. Don't you see how  great it is? Don't you see how both man and beast have to serve her? How  she has got on as well as she has on her bare feet? We must not tell her  what power she has; it is in her heart, because she is such a sweet  innocent child. If she can't reach the Snow Queen herself, then we can't  help her. The Snow Queen's gardens begin just two miles from here; you  can carry the little girl as far as that. Put her down by the big bush  standing there in the snow covered with red berries. Don't stand  gossiping, but hurry back to me!' Then the Finn woman lifted Gerda on  the reindeer's back, and it rushed off as hard as it could.    'Oh, I have not got my boots, and I have not got my mittens!' cried  little Gerda.    She soon felt the want of them in that cutting wind, but the reindeer  did not dare to stop. It ran on till it came to the bush with the red  berries. There it put Gerda down, and kissed her on the mouth, while big  shining tears trickled down its face. Then it ran back again as fast as  ever it could. There stood poor little Gerda, without shoes or  gloves, in the middle of freezing icebound Finmark.    She ran forward as quickly as she could. A whole regiment of snow-flakes  came towards her; they did not fall from the sky, for it was quite  clear, with the northern lights shining brightly. No; these snow-flakes  ran along the ground, and the nearer they came the bigger they grew.  Gerda remembered well how big and ingenious they looked under the  magnifying glass. But the size of these was monstrous. They were alive;  they were the Snow Queen's advanced guard, and they took the most  curious shapes. Some looked like big, horrid porcupines, some like  bundles of knotted snakes with their heads sticking out. Others, again,  were like fat little bears with bristling hair, but all were dazzling  white and living snow-flakes.    Then little Gerda said the Lord's Prayer, and the cold was so great that  her breath froze as it came out of her mouth, and she could see it like  a cloud of smoke in front of her. It grew thicker and thicker, till it  formed itself into bright little angels, who grew bigger and bigger when  they touched the ground. They all wore helmets, and carried shields and  spears in their hands. More and more of them appeared, and when Gerda  had finished her prayer she was surrounded by a whole legion. They  pierced the snow-flakes with their spears and shivered them into a  hundred pieces, and little Gerda walked fearlessly and undauntedly  through them. The angels touched her hands and her feet, and then she  hardly felt how cold it was, but walked quickly on towards the Palace of  the Snow Queen.    Now we must see what Kay was about. He was not thinking about Gerda at  all, least of all that she was just outside the Palace.

I hope you will make a prompt  denial, if you hear any talk like that.\" He pressed a button on his desk.  \"And now, I'll get a letter of authorization made out for you, Mr.  Rand ...\"          CHAPTER 4      Stephen Gresham was in his early sixties, but he could have still worn  his World War I uniform without anything giving at the seams, and buckled  the old Sam Browne at the same hole. As Rand entered, he rose from behind  his desk and advanced, smiling cordially.    \"Why, hello, Jeff!\" he greeted the detective, grasping his hand heartily.  \"You haven't been around for months. What have you been doing, and why  don't you come out to Rosemont to see us? Dot and Irene were wondering  what had become of you.\"    \"I'm afraid I've been neglecting too many of my old friends lately,\"  Rand admitted, sitting down and getting his pipe out. \"Been busy as the  devil. Fact is, it was business that finally brought me around here. I  understand that you and some others are forming a pool to buy the Lane  Fleming collection.\"    \"Yes!\" Gresham became enthusiastic. \"Want in on it? I'm sure the others  would be glad to have you in with us. We're going to need all the money  we can scrape together, with this damned Rivers bidding against us.\"    \"I'm afraid you will, at that, Stephen,\" Rand told him. \"And not  necessarily on account of Rivers. You see, the Fleming estate has just  employed me to expertize the collection and handle the sale for them.\"  Rand got his pipe lit and drawing properly. \"I hate doing this to you,  but you know how it is.\"    \"Oh, of course. I should have known they'd get somebody like you in  to sell the collection for them. Humphrey Goode isn't competent to  handle that. What we were all afraid of was a public auction at some  sales-gallery.\"    Rand shook his head. \"Worst thing they could do; a collection like  that would go for peanuts at auction. Remember the big sales in the  twenties?... Why, here; I'm going to be in Rosemont, staying at the  Fleming place, working on the collection, for the next week or so. I  suppose your crowd wouldn't want to make an offer until I have everything  listed, but I'd like to talk to your associates, in a group, as soon as  possible.\"    \"Well, we all know pretty much what's in the collection,\" Gresham said.  \"We were neighbors of his, and collectors are a gregarious lot. But we  aren't anxious to make any premature offers. We don't want to offer more  than we have to, and at the same time, we don't want to underbid and see  the collection sold elsewhere.\"    \"No, of course not.\" Rand thought for a moment. \"Tell you what; I'll give  you and your friends the best break I can in fairness to my clients. I'm  not obliged to call for sealed bids, or anything like that, so when I've  heard from everybody, I'll give you a chance to bid against the highest  offer in hand. If you want to top it, you can have the collection for any  kind of an overbid that doesn't look too suspiciously nominal.\"    \"Why, Jeff, I appreciate that,\" Gresham said. \"I think you're entirely  within your rights, but naturally, we won't mention this outside. I can  imagine Arnold Rivers, for instance, taking a very righteous view of such  an arrangement.\"    \"Yes, so can I. Of course, if he'd call me a crook, I'd take that as  a compliment,\" Rand said. \"I wonder if I could meet your group, say  tomorrow evening? I want to be in a position to assure the Fleming family  and Humphrey Goode that you're all serious and responsible.\"    \"Well, we're very serious about it,\" Gresham replied, \"and I think we're  all responsible. You can look us up, if you wish. Besides myself, there  is Philip Cabot, of Cabot, Joyner & Teale, whom you know, and Adam  Trehearne, who's worth about a half-million in industrial shares, and  Colin MacBride, who's vice president in charge of construction and  maintenance for Edison-Public Power & Light, at about twenty thousand a  year, and Pierre Jarrett and his fiancee, Karen Lawrence. Pierre was a  Marine captain, invalided home after being wounded on Peleliu; he writes  science-fiction for the pulps. Karen has a little general-antique  business in Rosemont. They intend using their share of the collection,  plus such culls and duplicates as the rest of us can consign to them, to  go into the arms business, with a general-antique sideline, which Karen  can manage while Pierre's writing.... Tell you what; I'll call a meeting  at my place tomorrow evening, say at eight thirty. That suit you?\"    That, Rand agreed, would be all right. Gresham asked him how recently he  had seen the Fleming collection.    \"About two years ago; right after I got back from Germany. You remember,  we went there together, one evening in March.\"    \"Yes, that's right. We didn't have time to see everything,\" Gresham said.  \"My God, Jeff! Twenty-five wheel locks! Ten snaphaunces. And every  imaginable kind of flintlock--over a hundred U.S. Martials, including the  1818 Springfield, all the S. North types, a couple of Virginia  Manufactory models, and--he got this since the last time you saw the  collection--a real Rappahannock Forge flintlock. And about a hundred and  fifty Colts, all models and most variants. Remember that big Whitneyville  Walker, in original condition? He got that one in 1924, at the Fred Hines  sale, at the old Walpole Galleries. And seven Paterson Colts, including  a couple of cased sets. And anything else you can think of. A Hall  flintlock breech-loader; an Elisha Collier flintlock revolver; a pair  of Forsythe detonator-lock pistols.... Oh, that's a collection to end  collections.\"    \"By the way, Humphrey Goode showed me a pair of big ball-butt wheel  locks, all covered with ivory inlay,\" Rand mentioned.    Gresham laughed heartily. \"Aren't they the damnedest ever seen, though?\"  he asked. \"Made in Germany, about 1870 or '80, about the time  arms-collecting was just getting out of the family-heirloom stage,  wouldn't you say?\"    \"I'd say made in Japan, about 1920,\" Rand replied. \"Remember, there were  a couple of small human figures on each pistol, a knight and a huntsman?  Did you notice that they had slant eyes?\" He stopped laughing, and looked  at Gresham seriously. \"Just how much more of that sort of thing do you  think I'm going to have to weed out of the collection, before I can offer  it for sale?\" he asked.    Gresham shook his head. \"They're all. They were Lane Fleming's one false  step. Ordinarily, Lane was a careful buyer; he must have let himself get  hypnotized by all that ivory and gold, and all that documentation on  crested notepaper. You know, Fleming's death was an undeserved stroke of  luck for Arnold Rivers. If he hadn't been killed just when he was, he'd  have run Rivers out of the old-arms business.\"    \"I notice that Rivers isn't advertising in the _American Rifleman_ any  more,\" Rand observed.    \"No; the National Rifle Association stopped his ad, and lifted his  membership card for good measure,\" Gresham said. \"Rivers sold a rifle to  a collector down in Virginia, about three years ago, while you were still  occupying Germany. A fine, early flintlock Kentuck, that had been made  out of a fine, late percussion Kentuck by sawing off the breech-end of  the barrel, rethreading it for the breech-plug, drilling a new vent, and  fitting the lock with a flint hammer and a pan-and-frizzen assembly, and  shortening the fore-end to fit. Rivers has a gunsmith over at Kingsville,  one Elmer Umholtz, who does all his fraudulent conversions for him. I  have an example of Umholtz's craftsmanship, myself. The collector who  bought this spurious flintlock spotted what had been done, and squawked  to the Rifle Association, and to the postal authorities.\"    \"Rivers claimed, I suppose, that he had gotten it from a family that had  owned it ever since it was made, and showed letters signed 'D. Boone' and  'Davy Crockett' to prove it?\"    \"No, he claimed to have gotten it in trade from some wayfaring  collector,\" Gresham replied. \"He convinced Uncle Whiskers, but the  N.R.A. took a slightly dimmer view of the transaction, so Rivers doesn't  advertise in the _Rifleman_ any more.\"    \"Wasn't there some talk about Whitneyville Walker Colts that had been  made out of 1848 Model Colt Dragoons?\" Rand asked.    \"Oh Lord, yes! This fellow Umholtz was practically turning them out on  an assembly-line, for a while. Rivers must have sold about ten of them.  You know, Umholtz is a really fine gunsmith; I had him build a deer-rifle  for Dot, a couple of years ago--Mexican-Mauser action, Johnson  barrel, chambered for .300 Savage; Umholtz made the stock and fitted a  scope-sight--it's a beautiful little rifle. I hate to see him prostitute  his talents the way he does by making these fake antiques for Rivers. You  know, he made one of these mythical heavy .44 six-shooters of the sort  Colt was supposed to have turned out at Paterson in 1839 for Colonel  Walker's Texas Rangers--you know, the model he couldn't find any of in  1847, when he made the real Walker Colt. That story you find in Sawyer's  book.\"    \"Why, that story's been absolutely disproved,\" Rand said. \"There never  was any such revolver.\"    \"Not till Umholtz made one,\" Gresham replied. \"Rivers sold it to,\"--he  named a moving-picture bigshot--\"for twenty-five hundred dollars. His  story was that he picked it up in Mexico, in 1938; traded a .38-special  to some halfbreed goat-herder for it.\"    \"This fellow who bought it, now; did he see Belden and Haven's Colt book,  when it came out in 1940?\"    \"Yes, and he was plenty burned up, but what could he do? Rivers was dug  in behind this innocent-purchase-and-sale-in-good-faith Maginot Line of  his. You know, that bastard took me, once, just one-tenth as badly, with  a fake U.S. North & Cheney Navy flintlock 1799 Model that had been made  out of a French 1777 Model.\" The lawyer muttered obscenely.    \"Why didn't you sue hell out of him?\" Rand asked. \"You might not have"]]]
