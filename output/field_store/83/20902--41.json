Alternate layers of beef, salt pork, and hard bread  were put in the pot, covered with water, and baked all night in a hole  full of coals.    Fish may also be cooked in the same way. It is not advisable, however,  for parties less than six in number to trouble themselves to cook in  this manner.      CARE OF FOOD.    You had better _carry_ butter in a tight tin or wooden box. In permanent  camp you can sink it in strong brine, and it will keep some weeks.  Ordinary butter will not keep sweet a long time in hot weather unless in  a cool place or in brine. Hence it is better to replenish your stock  often, if it is possible for you to do so.    You perhaps do not need to be told that when camping or marching it is  more difficult to prevent loss of food from accidents, and from want of  care, than when at home. It is almost daily in danger from rain, fog, or  dew, cats and dogs, and from flies or insects. If it is necessary for  you to take a large quantity of any thing, instead of supplying yourself  frequently, you must pay particular attention to packing, so that it  shall neither be spoiled, nor spoil any thing else.    You cannot keep meats and fish fresh for many hours on a summer day; but  you may preserve either over night, if you will sprinkle a little salt  upon it, and place it in a wet bag of thin cloth which flies cannot go  through; hang the bag in a current of air, and out of the reach of  animals.    In permanent camp it is well to sink a barrel in the earth in some dry,  shaded place; it will answer for a cellar in which to keep your food  cool. Look out that your cellar is not flooded in a heavy shower, and  that ants and other insects do not get into your food.    The lumbermen's way of carrying salt pork is good. They take a clean  butter-tub with four or five gimlet-holes bored in the bottom near the  chimbs. Then they pack the pork in, and cover it with coarse salt; the  holes let out what little brine makes, and thus they have a dry tub.  Upon the pork they place a neatly fitting \"follower,\" with a cleat or  knob for a handle, and then put in such other eatables as they choose.  Pork can be kept sweet for a few weeks in this way, even in the warmest  weather; and by it you avoid the continual risk of upsetting and losing  the brine. Before you start, see that the cover of the firkin is neither  too tight nor too loose, so that wet or dry weather may not affect it  too much.    I beg you to clean and wash your dishes as soon as you have done using  them, instead of leaving them till the next meal. Remember to take  dishcloths and towels, unless your all is a frying-pan and coffee-pot  that you are carrying upon your back, when leaves and grass must be made  to do dishcloth duty.          CHAPTER VII.    MARCHING.[7]      It is generally advised by medical men to avoid violent exercise  immediately after eating. They are right; but I cannot advise you to  rest long, or at all, after breakfast, but rather to finish what you  could not do before the meal, and get off at once while it is early and  cool. Do not hurry or work hard at first if you can avoid it.    On the march, rest often whether you feel tired or not; and, when  resting, see that you do rest.    The most successful marching that I witnessed in the army was done by  marching an hour, and resting ten minutes. You need not adhere strictly  to this rule: still I would advise you to halt frequently for  sight-seeing, but not to lie perfectly still more than five or ten  minutes, as a reaction is apt to set in, and you will feel fatigued upon  rising.    Experience has shown that a man travelling with a light load, or none,  will walk about three miles an hour; but you must not expect from this  that you can easily walk twelve miles in four heats of three miles each  with ten minutes rest between, doing it all in four and a half hours.  Although it is by no means difficult, my advice is for you not to expect  to walk at that rate, even through a country that you do not care to  see. You may get so used to walking after a while that these long and  rapid walks will not weary you; but in general you require more time,  and should take it.    Do not be afraid to drink good water as often as you feel thirsty; but  avoid large draughts of _cold_ water when you are heated or are  perspiring, and never drink enough to make yourself logy. You are apt to  break these rules on the first day in the open air, and after eating  highly salted food. You can often satisfy your thirst with simply  rinsing the mouth. You may have read quite different advice[8] from  this, which applies to those who travel far from home, and whose daily  changes bring them to water materially different from that of the day  before.    It is well to have a lemon in the haversack or pocket: a drop or two of  lemon-juice is a great help at times; but there is really nothing which  will quench the thirst that comes the first few days of living in the  open air. Until you become accustomed to the change, and the fever has  gone down, you should try to avoid drinking in a way that may prove  injurious. Base-ball players stir a little oatmeal in the water they  drink while playing, and it is said they receive a healthy stimulus  thereby.    Bathing is not recommended while upon the march, if one is fatigued or  has much farther to go. This seems to be good counsel, but I do advise a  good scrubbing near the close of the day; and most people will get  relief by frequently washing the face, hands, neck, arms, and breast,  when dusty or heated, although this is one of the things we used to hear  cried down in the army as hurtful. It probably is so to some people: if  it hurts you, quit it.      FOOT-SORENESS AND CHAFING.    After you have marched one day in the sun, your face, neck, and hands  will be sunburnt, your feet sore, perhaps blistered, your limbs may be  chafed; and when you wake up on the morning of the second day, after an  almost sleepless night, you will feel as if you had been \"dragged  through seven cities.\"    I am not aware that there is any preventive of sunburn for skins that  are tender. A hat is better to wear than a cap, but you will burn under  either. Oil or salve on the exposed parts, applied before marching, will  prevent some of the fire; and in a few days, if you keep in the open air  all the time, it will cease to be annoying.    To prevent foot-soreness, which is really the greatest bodily trouble  you will have to contend with, you must have good shoes as already  advised. You must wash your feet at least once a day, and oftener if  they feel the need of it. The great preventive of foot-soreness is to  have the feet, toes, and ankles covered with oil, or, better still,  salve or mutton-tallow; these seem to act as lubricators. Soap is better  than nothing. You ask if these do not soil the stockings. Most certainly  they do. Hence wash your stockings often, or the insides of the shoes  will become foul. Whenever you discover the slightest tendency of the  feet to grow sore or to heat, put on oil, salve, or soap, immediately.    People differ as to these things. To some a salve acts as an irritant:  to others soap acts in the same way. You must know before starting--your  mother can tell you if you don't know yourself--how oil, glycerine,  salve, and soap will affect your skin. Remember, the main thing is to  keep the feet clean and lubricated. Wet feet chafe and blister more  quickly than dry.    The same rule applies to chafing upon any part of the body. Wash and  anoint as tenderly as possible. If you have chafed in any part on  previous marches, anoint it before you begin this.    When the soldiers found their pantaloons were chafing them, they would  tie their handkerchiefs around their pantaloons, over the place  affected, thus preventing friction, and stopping the evil; but this is  not advisable for a permanent preventive. A bandage of cotton or linen  over the injured part will serve the purpose better.    Another habit of the soldiers was that of tucking the bottom of the  pantaloons into their stocking-legs when it was dusty or muddy, or when  they were cold. This is something worth remembering. You will hardly  walk a week without having occasion to try it.    Leather leggins, such as we read about in connection with Alpine travel,  are recommended by those who have used them as good for all sorts of  pedestrianism. They have not come into use much as yet in America.    The second day is usually the most fatiguing. As before stated, you  suffer from loss of sleep (for few people can sleep much the first night  in camp), you ache from unaccustomed work, smart from sunburn, and  perhaps your stomach has gotten out of order. For these reasons, when  one can choose his time, it is well to start on Friday, and so have  Sunday come as a day of rest and healing; but this is not at all a  necessity. If you do not try to do too much the first few days, it is  likely that you will feel better on the third night than at any previous  time.    I have just said that your stomach is liable to become disordered. You  will be apt to have a great thirst and not much appetite the first and  second days, followed by costiveness, lame stomach, and a feeling of  weakness or exhaustion. As a preventive, eat laxative foods on those  days,--figs are especially good,--and try not to work too hard. You  should lay your plans so as not to have much to do nor far to go at  first. Do not dose with medicines, nor take alcoholic stimulants. Physic  and alcohol may give a temporary relief, but they will leave you in bad  condition. And here let me say that there is little or no need of  spirits in your party. You will find coffee or tea far better than  alcohol.    Avoid all nonsensical waste of strength, and gymnastic feats, before and  during the march; play no jokes upon your comrades, that will make their  day's work more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#6)"],[1,"ment. Deliberating with  Tallien and Carnot, his colleagues, he suddenly said, \"I have the man  whom you want; it is a little Corsican officer, who will not stand upon  ceremony.\"    These words decided the fate of Napoleon and of France. Buonaparte had  been in the Odeon Theatre when the affair of Le Pelletier occurred, had  run out, and witnessed the result. He now happened to be in the gallery,  and heard the discussion concerning the conduct of Menou. He was  presently sent for, and asked his opinion as to that officer's retreat.  He explained what had happened, and how the evil might have been  avoided, in a manner which gave satisfaction. He was desired to assume  the command, and arrange his plan of defence as well as the  circumstances might permit; for it was already late at night, and the  decisive assault on the Tuileries was expected to take place next  morning. Buonaparte stated that the failure of the march of Menou had  been chiefly owing to the presence of the \"Representatives of the  People,\" and refused to accept the command unless he received it free  from all such interference. They yielded: Barras was named  Commander-in-Chief; and Buonaparte second, with the virtual control. His  first care was to dispatch Murat, then a major of Chasseurs, to Sablons,  five miles off, where fifty great guns were posted. The Sectionaries  sent a stronger detachment for these cannon immediately afterwards; and  Murat, who passed them in the dark, would have gone in vain had he  received his orders but a few minutes later.    On the 4th of October (called in the revolutionary almanack the 13th  Vendemaire) the affray accordingly occurred. Thirty thousand National  Guards advanced, about two p.m., by different streets, to the siege of  the palace: but its defence was now in far other hands than those of  Louis XVI.    Buonaparte, having planted artillery on all the bridges, had effectually  secured the command of the river, and the safety of the Tuileries on one  side. He had placed cannon also at all the crossings of the streets by  which the National Guard could advance towards the other front; and  having posted his battalions in the garden of the Tuileries and Place du  Carousel, he awaited the attack.    The insurgents had no cannon; and they came along the narrow streets of  Paris in close and heavy columns. When one party reached the church of  St. Roche, in the Rue St. Honore, they found a body of Buonaparte's  troops drawn up there, with two cannons. It is disputed on which side  the firing began; but in an instant the artillery swept the streets and  lanes, scattering grape-shot among the National Guards, and producing  such confusion that they were compelled to give way. The first shot was  a signal for all the batteries which Buonaparte had established; the  quays of the Seine, opposite to the Tuileries, were commanded by his  guns below the Palace and on the bridges. In less than an hour the  action was over. The insurgents fled in all directions, leaving the  streets covered with dead and wounded: the troops of the Convention  marched into the various sections, disarmed the terrified inhabitants,  and before nightfall everything was quiet.    This eminent service secured the triumph of the Conventionalists, who  now, assuming new names, continued in effect to discharge their old  functions. Barras took his place at the head of _the Directory_, having  Sieyes, Carnot, and other less celebrated persons, for his colleagues;  and the First Director took care to reward the hand to which he owed his  elevation. Within five days from _the day of the Sections_ Buonaparte  was named second in command of the army of the interior; and shortly  afterwards, Barras, finding his duties as Director sufficient to occupy  his time, gave up the command-in-chief of the same army to his \"little  Corsican officer.\"    He had no lack of duties to perform in this new character. The National  Guard was to be re-organised; a separate guard for the representative  body to be formed; the ordnance and military stores were all in a  dilapidated condition. The want of bread, too, was continually producing  popular riots, which could rarely be suppressed but by force of arms. On  one of these last occasions, a huge sturdy fishwife exhorted the mob to  keep to their places, when Buonaparte had almost persuaded them to  disperse. \"These coxcombs with their epaulettes and gorgets,\" said she,  \"care nothing for us; provided they feed well and fatten, we may  starve.\" \"Good woman,\" cried the general of the interior, who at this  time was about the leanest of his race, \"only look at me,--and decide  yourself which of the two is the fatter.\" The woman could not help  laughing: the joke pleased the multitude, and harmony was restored.    Buonaparte, holding the chief military command in the capital, and daily  rising in importance from the zeal and firmness of his conduct in this  high post, had now passed into the order of marked and distinguished  men. He continued, nevertheless, to lead in private a quiet and modest  life, studying as hard as ever, and but little seen in the circles of  gaiety. An accident which occurred one morning at his military levee,  gave at once a new turn to his mode of life, and a fresh impetus to the  advance of his fortunes.    A fine boy, of ten or twelve years of age, presented himself; stated to  the general that his name was Eugene Beauharnois, son of Viscount  Beauharnois, who had served as a general officer in the Republican  armies on the Rhine, and been murdered by Robespierre; and said his  errand was to recover the sword of his father. Buonaparte caused the  request to be complied with; and the tears of the boy, as he received  and kissed the relic, excited his interest. He treated Eugene so kindly,  that next day his mother, Josephine de Beauharnois, came to thank him;  and her beauty and singular gracefulness of address made a strong  impression.    This charming lady, the daughter of a planter, by name Tascher de la  Pagerie, was born in the island of Martinico, 24th June, 1763. While yet  an infant, according to a story which she afterwards repeated, a negro  sorceress had prophesied that \"she should one day be greater than a  queen, and yet outlive her dignity.\"[7]    The widow of Beauharnois had been herself imprisoned until the downfall  of Robespierre. In that confinement she had formed a strict friendship  with another lady who was now married to Tallien, one of the most  eminent of the leaders of the Convention. Madame Tallien had introduced  Josephine to her husband's friends; and Barras, the First Director,  having now begun to hold a sort of court at the Luxembourg, these two  beautiful women were the chief ornaments of its society. It was  commonly said--indeed it was universally believed--that Josephine, whose  character was in some respects indifferent, possessed more than  legitimate influence over the First Director. Buonaparte, however,  offered her his hand; she, after some hesitation, accepted it; and the  young general by this marriage (9th March, 1796) cemented his connection  with the society of the Luxembourg, and in particular with Barras and  Tallien, at that moment the most powerful men in France.    Napoleon had a strong tendency to the superstition of fatalism, and he  always believed that his fortunes were bound up in some mysterious  manner with those of this graceful woman. She loved him warmly, and  served him well. Her influence over him was great, and it was always  exerted on the side of humanity. She, and she alone, could overrule, by  gentleness, the excesses of passion to which he was liable; and her  subsequent fate will always form one of the darkest pages in the history  of her lord.    Tranquillity was now restored in Paris; and the Directory had leisure to  turn their attention to the affairs of the army of Italy, which were in  a most confused and unsatisfactory condition. They determined to give it  a new general; and Buonaparte was appointed to the splendid command. It  is acknowledged, in one of Josephine's letters, that the First Director  had promised to procure it for him before their marriage took place.  \"Advance this man,\" said Barras to his colleagues, \"or he will advance  himself without you.\"    Buonaparte quitted his wife ten days after their marriage; paid a short  visit to his mother at Marseilles; and arrived, after a rapid journey,  at the headquarters at Nice. From that moment opened the most brilliant  scene of his existence; yet, during the months of victory and glory that  composed it, his letters, full of love and home-sickness, attest the  reluctance with which he had so soon abandoned his bride.    [Footnote 6: De Bourienne.]    [Footnote 7: According to some, the last clause ran \"die in an  hospital,\" and this was in the sequel interpreted to mean Malmaison--a  palace which (like our own St. James's) had once been an hospital.]          CHAPTER IV         The Army of Italy--Tactics of Buonaparte--Battle of Monte       Notte--Battle of Millesimo--Battle of Mondovi--Armistice of       Cherasco--Close of the Campaign of Piedmont--Peace granted to       Sardinia.      Buonaparte at the age of twenty-six assumed the command of the army of  Italy; exulting in the knowledge that, if he should conquer, the honour  would be all his own. He had worked for others at Toulon, at the Col di  Tende, at Saorgio: even in the affair of the Sections the first command  had been nominally in the hands of Barras. Henceforth he was to have no  rivals within the camp. \"In three months,\" said he, \"I shall be either  at Milan or at Paris.\" He had already expressed the same feeling in a  still nobler form. \"You are too young,\" said one of the Directors,  hesitating about his appointment as general. \"In a year,\" answered  Napoleon, \"I shall be either old or dead.\"    He found the army in numbers about 50,000; but wretchedly deficient in  cavalry, in"]]]
