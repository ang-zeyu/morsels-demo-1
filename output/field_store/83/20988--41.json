He should in addition be informed as to the laws and principles,  the customs, conditions and manners, and the material and moral virtues  characterizing the statecraft of other nations, and should be well versed  in all the useful branches of learning of the day, and study the  historical records of bygone governments and peoples. For if a learned  individual has no knowledge of the sacred Scriptures and the entire field  of divine and natural science, of religious jurisprudence and the arts of  government and the varied learning of the time and the great events of  history, he might prove unequal to an emergency, and this is inconsistent  with the necessary qualification of comprehensive knowledge.    If for example a spiritually learned Muslim is conducting a debate with a  Christian and he knows nothing of the glorious melodies of the Gospel, he  will, no matter how much he imparts of the Qur'an and its truths, be  unable to convince the Christian, and his words will fall on deaf ears.  Should, however, the Christian observe that the Muslim is better versed in  the fundamentals of Christianity than the Christian priests themselves,  and understands the purport of the Scriptures even better than they, he  will gladly accept the Muslim's arguments, and he would indeed have no  other recourse.    When the Chief of the Exile(24) came into the presence of that Luminary of  divine wisdom, of salvation and certitude, the Imam Rida--had the Imam,  that mine of knowledge, failed in the course of their interview to base  his arguments on authority appropriate and familiar to the Exilarch, the  latter would never have acknowledged the greatness of His Holiness.    The state is, moreover, based upon two potent forces, the legislative and  the executive. The focal center of the executive power is the government,  while that of the legislative is the learned--and if this latter great  support and pillar should prove defective, how is it conceivable that the  state should stand?    In view of the fact that at the present time such fully developed and  comprehensively learned individuals are hard to come by, and the  government and people are in dire need of order and direction, it is  essential to establish a body of scholars the various groups of whose  membership would each be expert in one of the aforementioned branches of  knowledge. This body should with the greatest energy and vigor deliberate  as to all present and future requirements, and bring about equilibrium and  order.    Up to now the religious law has not been given a decisive role in our  courts, because each of the 'ulama has been handing down decrees as he saw  fit, based on his arbitrary interpretation and personal opinion. For  example, two men will go to law, and one of the 'ulama will find for the  plaintiff and another for the defendant. It may even happen that in one  and the same case two conflicting decisions will be handed down by the  same mujtahid, on the grounds that he was inspired first in one direction  and then in the other. There can be no doubt that this state of affairs  has confused every important issue and must jeopardize the very  foundations of society. For neither the plaintiff nor the defendant ever  loses hope of eventual success, and each in turn will waste his life in  the attempt to secure a later verdict which would reverse the previous  one. Their entire time is thus given over to litigation, with the result  that their life instead of being devoted to beneficial undertakings and  necessary personal affairs, is completely involved with the dispute.  Indeed, these two litigants might just as well be dead, for they can serve  their government and community not a particle. If, however, a definite and  final verdict were forthcoming, the duly convicted party would perforce  give up all hope of reopening the case, and would then be relieved on that  score and would go back to looking after his own concerns and those of  others.    Since the primary means for securing the peace and tranquillity of the  people, and the most effective agency for the advancement of high and low  alike, is this all-important matter, it is incumbent on those learned  members of the great consultative assembly who are thoroughly versed in  the Divine law to evolve a single, direct and definite procedure for the  settlement of litigations. This instrument should then be published  throughout the country by order of the king, and its provisions should be  strictly adhered to. This all-important question requires the most urgent  attention.    The second attribute of perfection is justice and impartiality. This means  to have no regard for one's own personal benefits and selfish advantages,  and to carry out the laws of God without the slightest concern for  anything else. It means to see one's self as only one of the servants of  God, the All-Possessing, and except for aspiring to spiritual distinction,  never attempting to be singled out from the others. It means to consider  the welfare of the community as one's own. It means, in brief, to regard  humanity as a single individual, and one's own self as a member of that  corporeal form, and to know of a certainty that if pain or injury afflicts  any member of that body, it must inevitably result in suffering for all  the rest.    The third requirement of perfection is to arise with complete sincerity  and purity of purpose to educate the masses: to exert the utmost effort to  instruct them in the various branches of learning and useful sciences, to  encourage the development of modern progress, to widen the scope of  commerce, industry and the arts, to further such measures as will increase  the people's wealth. For the mass of the population is uninformed as to  these vital agencies which would constitute an immediate remedy for  society's chronic ills.    It is essential that scholars and the spiritually learned should undertake  in all sincerity and purity of intent and for the sake of God alone, to  counsel and exhort the masses and clarify their vision with that collyrium  which is knowledge. For today the people out of the depths of their  superstition, imagine that any individual who believes in God and His  signs, and in the Prophets and Divine Revelations and laws, and is a  devout and God-fearing person, must of necessity remain idle and spend his  days in sloth, so as to be considered in the sight of God as one who has  forsaken the world and its vanities, set his heart on the life to come,  and isolated himself from human beings in order to draw nearer to God.  Since this theme will be developed elsewhere in the present text, We shall  leave it for the moment.    Other attributes of perfection are to fear God, to love God by loving His  servants, to exercise mildness and forbearance and calm, to be sincere,  amenable, clement and compassionate; to have resolution and courage,  trustworthiness and energy, to strive and struggle, to be generous, loyal,  without malice, to have zeal and a sense of honor, to be high-minded and  magnanimous, and to have regard for the rights of others. Whoever is  lacking in these excellent human qualities is defective. If We were to  explain the inner meanings of each one of these attributes, \"the poem  would take up seventy maunds(25) of paper.\"            [PAGES 41-60]      The second of these spiritual standards which apply to the possessor of  knowledge is that he should be the defender of his faith. It is obvious  that these holy words do not refer exclusively to searching out the  implications of the Law, observing the forms of worship, avoiding greater  and lesser sins, practicing the religious ordinances, and by all these  methods, protecting the Faith. They mean rather that the whole population  should be protected in every way; that every effort should be exerted to  adopt a combination of all possible measures to raise up the Word of God,  increase the number of believers, promote the Faith of God and exalt it  and make it victorious over other religions.    If, indeed, the Muslim religious authorities had persevered along these  lines as they ought to have done, by now every nation on earth would have  been gathered into the shelter of the unity of God and the bright fire of  \"that He may make it victorious over every other religion\"(26) would have  flamed out like the sun in the midmost heart of the world.    Fifteen centuries after Christ, Luther, who was originally one of the  twelve members of a Catholic religious body at the center of the Papal  government and later on initiated the Protestant religious belief, opposed  the Pope on certain points of doctrine such as the prohibition of monastic  marriage, the revering and bowing down before images of the Apostles and  Christian leaders of the past, and various other religious practices and  ceremonies which were accretional to the ordinances of the Gospel.  Although at that period the power of the Pope was so great and he was  regarded with such awe that the kings of Europe shook and trembled before  him, and he held control of all Europe's major concerns in the grasp of  his might--nevertheless because Luther's position as regards the freedom of  religious leaders to marry, the abstention from worshiping and making  prostrations before images and representations hung in the churches, and  the abrogation of ceremonials which had been added on to the Gospel, was  demonstrably correct, and because the proper means were adopted for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#6)"],[1,"work for peace  and promulgate the oneness of humankind. For the foundation of all is  reality and reality is not multiple or divisible. His Holiness Moses  founded it, His Holiness Jesus raised its tent, and its brilliant light  has shone forth in all the religions. His Holiness Baha'u'llah proclaimed  this one reality and spread the message of the \"Most Great Peace\". Even in  prison he rested not until he lighted this lamp in the East. Praise be to  God! all who have accepted his teachings are lovers of peace, peacemakers  ready to sacrifice their lives and expend their possessions for it. Now  let this standard be upraised in the West and many will respond to the  call. America has become renowned for her discoveries, inventions and  artistic skill, famous for equity of government and stupendous  undertakings; now may she also become noted and celebrated as the herald  and messenger of Universal Peace. Let this be her mission and undertaking  and may its blessed impetus spread to all countries. I pray for all of you  that you may render this service to the world of humanity.            FOUNDATIONS OF WORLD UNITY      There is not one soul whose conscience does not testify that in this day  there is no more important matter in the world than that of Universal  Peace. Every just one bears witness to this and adores that esteemed  Assembly(5) because its aim is that this darkness may be turned into  light, this bloodthirstiness into kindness, this torment into bliss, this  hardship into ease and this enmity and hatred into fellowship and love.  Therefore the effort of those esteemed souls is worthy of praise and  commendation.    But the wise souls who are aware of the essential relationships emanating  from the realities of things consider that one single matter cannot, by  itself, influence the human reality as it ought and should, for until the  minds of men become united, no important matter can be accomplished. At  present Universal Peace is a matter of great importance, but unity of  conscience is essential, so that the foundation of this matter may become  secure, its establishment firm and its edifice strong.    Therefore His Holiness Baha'u'llah fifty years ago, expounded this  question of Universal Peace at a time when he was confined in the fortress  of Akka and was wronged and imprisoned. He wrote about this matter of  Universal Peace to all the great sovereigns of the world, and established  it among his friends in the Orient. The horizon of the East was in utter  darkness, nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity towards each  other, religions thirsted for each other's blood, and it was darkness upon  darkness. At such a time His Holiness Baha'u'llah shone forth like the sun  from the horizon of the East and illumined Persia with the light of these  teachings.    Among his teachings was the declaration of Universal Peace. People of  different nations, religions and sects, who followed him, came together to  such an extent that remarkable gatherings were instituted, consisting of  the various nations and religions of the East. Every soul who entered  those gatherings saw but one nation, one pathway, one teaching, one order;  for the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah were not limited to the  establishment of Universal Peace. They embraced many teachings which  supplemented and supported that of Universal Peace.    Among these teachings is the independent investigation of reality, so that  the world of humanity might be saved from the darkness of imitation and  attain to the truth; might tear off and cast away this ragged and outworn  garment of one thousand years ago and put on the robe woven in the utmost  purity and holiness in the loom of reality. As reality is one and cannot  admit of multiplicity, therefore different opinions must ultimately become  fused into one.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the  world of humanity; that all human beings are the sheep of God and He is  the kind Shepherd. This Shepherd is kind to all the sheep, because He  created them all, trained them, provided for them and protected them.  There is no doubt that the Shepherd is kind to all the sheep; and should  there be among these sheep ignorant ones, they must be educated; if there  be children, they must be trained until they reach maturity; if there be  sick ones, they must be healed. There must be no hatred and enmity, for as  by a kind physician these ignorant, sick ones should be treated.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is that religion must  be the cause of fellowship and love. If it becomes the cause of  estrangement, then it is not needed, for religion is like a remedy: if it  aggravates the disease, then it becomes unnecessary.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religious, racial,  political, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of  humanity. As long as these prejudices prevail, the world of humanity will  have no rest. For a period of six thousand years history informs us about  the world of humanity. During these six thousand years the world of  humanity has not been free from war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness.  In every period war has been waged in one country or another, and that war  was due to either religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political  prejudice or patriotic prejudice. It has, therefore, been ascertained and  proved that all prejudices are destructive of the human edifice. As long  as these prejudices persist, the struggle for existence must remain  dominant, and bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue. Therefore, even as  was the case in the past, the world of humanity cannot be saved from the  darkness of nature, and cannot attain illumination, except through the  abandonment of prejudices and the acquisition of the morals of the  Kingdom....    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the origination of  one language that may be spread universally among the people. This  teaching was revealed from the pen of Baha'u'llah in order that this  universal language may eliminate misunderstandings from among mankind.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the equality of  women and men. The world of humanity has two wings-- one is woman and the  other man. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird fly.  Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of  woman becomes equal to the world of man in the acquisition of virtues and  perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is voluntary sharing of one's  property with others among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater than  equality, and consists in this: that man should not prefer himself to  others, but rather should sacrifice his life and property for others. But  this should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law and man  is compelled to follow it. Nay, rather should man voluntarily and of his  own choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend willingly  for the poor, just as is done in Persia among the Baha'is.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is man's freedom: that  through the Ideal Power he should be emancipated and free from the  captivity of the world of nature; for as long as man is captive to nature  he is a ferocious animal, as the struggle for existence is one of the  exigencies of the world of nature. This matter of the struggle for  existence is the fountain-head of all calamities, and is the supreme  affliction.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religion is a mighty  bulwark. If the edifice of religion shakes and totters, commotion and  chaos will ensue and the order of things will be utterly upset, for in the  world of mankind there are two safeguards that protect man from  wrongdoing. One is the law which punishes the criminal; but the law  prevents only the manifest crime and not the concealed sin; whereas the  ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of God, prevents both the manifest  and the concealed crime, trains man, educates morals, compels the adoption  of virtues and is the all-inclusive power which guarantees the felicity of  the world of mankind. But by religion is meant that which is ascertained  by investigation and not that which is based on mere imitation, the  foundation of divine religions and not human imitations.    And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that although material  civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of mankind,  yet until it becomes combined with divine civilization the desired result,  which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained. Consider! These  battleships that reduce a city to ruins within the space of an hour are  the result of material civilization; likewise the Krupp guns, the Mauser  rifles, dynamite, submarines, torpedo boats, armed aircraft and bombing  aeroplanes--all these weapons of war are malignant fruits of material  civilization. Had material civilization been combined with divine  civilization, these fiery weapons would never have been invented. Nay,  rather human energy would have been wholly devoted to useful inventions  and concentrated on praiseworthy discoveries. Material civilization is  like a globe of glass. Divine civilization is the light itself, and the  glass without the light is dark. Material civilization is like the body.  No matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and beautiful it may be, it is  dead. Divine civilization is like the spirit, and the body gets its life  from the spirit, otherwise it becomes a corpse. It has thus been made  evident that the world of mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy  Spirit. Without the spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without  this light the world of mankind is in utter darkness. For the world of  nature is an animal world. Until man is born"]]]
