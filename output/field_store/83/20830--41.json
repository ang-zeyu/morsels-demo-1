Wagner, at the same age, a victor, worshipped, flattered, and--if we are  to believe the Bayreuth legend--crowned with prosperity; Wagner, sad and  suffering, doubting his achievements, feeling the inanity of his bitter  fight against the mediocrity of the world, had \"fled far from the  world\"[49] and thrown himself into religion; and when a friend looked at  him in surprise as he was saying grace at table, he answered: \"Yes, I  believe in my Saviour.\"[50]    [Footnote 48: _Memoires_, II, 415.]    [Footnote 49: \"Yes, it is to that escape from the world that _Parsifal_  owes its birth and growth. What man can, during a whole lifetime, gaze  into the depths of this world with a calm reason and a cheerful heart?  When he sees murder and rapine organised and legalised by a system of  lies, impostures, and hypocrisy, will he not avert his eyes and shudder  with disgust?\" (Wagner, _Representations of the Sacred Drama of Parsifal  at Bayreuth, in 1882_.)]    [Footnote 50: The scene was described to me by his friend, Malwida von  Meysenbug, the calm and fearless author of _Memoires d'une Idealiste_.]    Poor beings! Conquerors of the world, conquered and broken!    But of the two deaths, how much sadder is that of the artist who was  without a faith, and who had neither strength nor stoicism enough to be  happy without one; who slowly died in that little room in the rue de  Calais amid the distracting noise of an indifferent and even hostile  Paris;[51] who shut himself up in savage silence; who saw no loved face  bending over him in his last moments; who had not the comfort of belief  in his work;[52] who could not think calmly of what he had done, nor  look proudly back over the road he had trodden, nor rest content in the  thought of a life well lived; and who began and closed his _Memoires_  with Shakespeare's gloomy words, and repeated them when dying:--        \"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player      That struts and frets his hour upon the stage      And then is heard no more: it is a tale      Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,      Signifying nothing.\"[53]    [Footnote 51: \"I have only blank walls before my windows. On the side of  the street a pug dog has been barking for an hour, a parrot screaming,  and a parroqueet imitating the chirp of sparrows. On the side of the  yard the washerwomen are singing, and another parroqueet cries  incessantly, 'Shoulder arrms!' How long the day is!\"    \"The maddening noise of carriages shakes the silence of the night. Paris  wet and muddy! Parisian Paris! Now everything is quiet ... she is  sleeping the sleep of the unjust\" (Written to Ferrand, _Lettres  intimes_, pp. 269 and 302).]    [Footnote 52: He used to say that nothing would remain of his work; that  he had deceived himself; and that he would have liked to burn his  scores.]    [Footnote 53: Blaze de Bury met him one autumn evening, on the quay,  just before his death, as he was returning from the Institute. \"His face  was pale, his figure wasted and bent, and his expression dejected and  nervous; one might have taken him for a walking shadow. Even his eyes,  those large round hazel eyes, had extinguished their fire. For a second  he clasped my hand in his own thin, lifeless one, and repeated, in a  voice that was hardly more than a whisper, Aeschylus's words: 'Oh, this  life of man! When he is happy a shadow is enough to disturb him; and  when he is unhappy his trouble may be wiped away, as with a wet sponge,  and all is forgotten'\" (_Musiciens d'hier et d'aujourd'hui_).]    Such was the unhappy and irresolute heart that found itself united to  one of the most daring geniuses in the world. It is a striking example  of the difference that may exist between genius and greatness--for the  two words are not synonymous. When one speaks of greatness, one speaks  of greatness of soul, nobility of character, firmness of will, and,  above all, balance of mind. I can understand how people deny the  existence of these qualities in Berlioz; but to deny his musical genius,  or to cavil about his wonderful power--and that is what they do daily in  Paris--is lamentable and ridiculous. Whether he attracts one or not, a  thimbleful of some of his work, a single part in one of his works, a  little bit of the _Fantastique_ or the overture of _Benvenuto_, reveal  more genius--I am not afraid to say it--than all the French music of his  century. I can understand people arguing about him in a country that  produced Beethoven and Bach; but with us in France, who can we set up  against him? Gluck and Cesar Franck were much greater men, but they were  never geniuses of his stature. If genius is a creative force, I cannot  find more than four or five geniuses in the world who rank above him.  When I have named Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Haendel, and Wagner, I do not  know who else is superior to Berlioz; I do not even know who is his  equal.    He is not only a musician, he is music itself. He does not command his  familiar spirit, he is its slave. Those who know his writings know how  he was simply possessed and exhausted by his musical emotions. They were  really fits of ecstasy or convulsions. At first \"there was feverish  excitement; the veins beat violently and tears flowed freely. Then came  spasmodic contractions of the muscles, total numbness of the feet and  hands, and partial paralysis of the nerves of sight and hearing; he saw  nothing, heard nothing; he was giddy and half faint.\" And in the case of  music that displeased him, he suffered, on the contrary, from \"a painful  sense of bodily disquiet and even from nausea.\"[54]    The possession that music held over his nature shows itself clearly in  the sudden outbreak of his genius.[55] His family opposed the idea of  his becoming a musician; and until he was twenty-two or twenty-three  years old his weak will sulkily gave way to their wishes. In obedience  to his father he began his studies in medicine at Paris. One evening he  heard _Les Danaides_ of Salieri. It came upon him like a thunderclap. He  ran to the Conservatoire library and read Gluck's scores.    [Footnote 54: _A travers chants_, pp. 8-9.]    [Footnote 55: In truth, this genius was smouldering since his childhood;  it was there from the beginning; and the proof of it lies in the fact  that he used for his _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_ and for the _Symphonie  fantastique_ airs and phrases of quintets which he had written when  twelve years old (see _Memoires_, I, 16-18).]    He forgot to eat and drink; he was like a man in a frenzy. A  performance of _Iphigenie en Tauride_ finished him. He studied under  Lesueur and then at the Conservatoire. The following year, 1827, he  composed _Les Francs-Juges_; two years afterwards the _Huit scenes de  Faust_, which was the nucleus of the future _Damnation_;[56] three years  afterwards, the _Symphonie fantastique_ (commenced in 1830).[57] And he  had not yet got the _Prix de Rome_! Add to this that in 1828 he had  already ideas for _Romeo et Juliette_, and that he had written a part of  _Lelio_ in 1829. Can one find elsewhere a more dazzling musical debut?  Compare that of Wagner who, at the same age, was shyly writing _Les  Fees, Defense d'aimer_, and _Rienzi_.    [Footnote 56: The _Huit scenes de Faust_ are taken from Goethe's  tragedy, translated by _Gerard de Nerval_, and they include: (1) _Chants  de la fete de Paques_; (2) _Paysans sous les tilleuls_; (3) _Concert des  Sylphes_; (4 and 5) _Taverne d'Auerbach_, with the two songs of the Rat  and the Flea; (6) _Chanson du roi de Thule_; (7) _Romance de  Marguerite_, \"D'amour, l'ardente flamme,\" and _Choeur de soldats_; (8)  _Serenade de Mephistopheles_--that is to say, the most celebrated and  characteristic pages of the _Damnation_ (see M. Prudhomme's essays on  _Le Cycle de Berlioz_).]    [Footnote 57: One could hardly find a better manifestation of the soul  of a youthful musical genius than that in certain letters written at  this time; in particular the letter written to Ferrand on 28 June, 1828,  with its feverish postscript. What a life of rich and overflowing  vigour! It is a joy to read it; one drinks at the source of life  itself.]    He wrote them at the same age, but ten years later; for _Les Fees_  appeared in 1833, when Berlioz had already written the _Fantastique_,  the _Huit scenes de Faust, Lelio_, and _Harold; Rienzi_ was only played  in 1842, after _Benvenuto_ (1835), _Le Requiem_ (1837), _Romeo_ (1839),  _La Symphonie funebre et triomphale_ (1840)--that is to say, when  Berlioz had finished all his great works, and after he had achieved his  musical revolution. And that revolution was effected alone, without a  model, without a guide. What could he have heard beyond the operas of  Gluck and Spontini while he was at the Conservatoire? At the time when  he composed the _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_ even the name of Weber was  unknown to him,[58] and of Beethoven's compositions he had only heard an  _andante_.[59]    Truly, he is a miracle and the most startling phenomenon in the history  of nineteenth-century music. His audacious power dominates all his age;  and in the face of such a genius, who would not follow Paganini's  example, and hail him as Beethoven's only successor?[60] Who does not  see what a poor figure the young Wagner cut at that time, working away  in laborious and self-satisfied mediocrity? But Wagner soon made up for  lost ground; for he knew what he wanted, and he wanted it obstinately.    [Footnote 58: _Memoires_, I, 70.]    [Footnote 59: _Ibid_. To make amends for this he published, in 1829, a  biographical notice of Beethoven, in which his appreciation of him is  remarkably in advance of his age. He wrote there: \"The _Choral Symphony_  is the culminating point of Beethoven's genius,\" and he speaks of the  Fourth Symphony in C sharp minor with great discernment.]    [Footnote"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16469"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume II.

Howel himself, in one of his  familiar epistles, says, that his ascendant was that hot constellation  of Cancer about the middle of the Dog Days. After he was educated in  grammar learning in the free school of Hereford, he was sent to Jesus  College in the beginning of 1610, took a degree in arts, and then  quitted the university. By the help of friends, and a small sum of  money his father assisted him with, he travelled for three years into  several countries, where he improved himself in the various languages;  some years after his return, the reputation of his parts was so great,  that he was made choice of to be sent into Spain, to recover of the  Spanish monarch a rich English ship, seized by the Viceroy of Sardinia  for his master's use, upon some pretence of prohibited goods being  found in it.    During his absence, he was elected Fellow of Jesus College, 1623, and  upon his return, was patronized by Emanuel, lord Scroop, Lord  President of the North, and by him was made his secretary[2]. As he  resided in York, he was, by the Mayor and Aldermen of Richmond, chose  a Burgess for their Corporation to sit in that Parliament, that began  at Westminster in the year 1627. Four years after, he went secretary  to Robert, earl of Leicester, ambassador extraordinary from England to  the King of Denmark, before whom he made several Latin speeches,  shewing the occasion of their embassy, viz. to condole the death of  Sophia, Queen Dowager of Denmark, Grandmother to Charles I. King of  England.    Our author enjoyed many beneficial employments, and at length, about  the beginning of the civil war, was made one of the clerks of the  council, but being extravagant in his temper, all the money he got was  not sufficient to preserve him from a Jail. When the King was forced  from the Parliament, and the Royal interest declined, Howel was  arrested; by order of a certain committee, who owed him no good-will,  and carried prisoner to the Fleet; and having now nothing to depend  upon but his wits, he was obliged to write and translate books for a  livelihood, which brought him in, says Wood, a comfortable  subsistance, during his stay there; he is the first person we have met  with, in the course of this work, who may be said to have made a trade  of authorship, having written no less than 49 books on different  subjects.    In the time of the rebellion, we find Howel tampering with the  prevailing power, and ready to have embraced their measures; for which  reason, at the reiteration, he was not contin[u]ed in his place of  clerk to the council, but was only made king's historiographer, being  the first in England, says Wood, who bore that title; and having no  very beneficial employment, he wrote books to the last.    He had a great knowledge in modern histories, especially in those of  the countries in which he had travelled, and he seems, by his letters,  to have been no contemptible politician: As to his poetry, it is  smoother, and more harmonious, than was very common with the bards of  his time.    As he introduced the trade of writing for bread, so he also is charged  with venal flattery, than which nothing can be more ignoble and base.  To praise a blockhead's wit because he is great, is too frequently  practised by authors, and deservedly draws down contempt upon them. He  who is favoured and patronized by a great man, at the expence of his  integrity and honour, has paid a dear price for the purchase, a  miserable exchange, patronage for virtue, dependance for freedom.    Our author died the beginning of November, 1666, and was buried on the  North side of the Temple church.    We shall not trouble the reader with an enumeration of all the  translations and prose works of this author; the occasion of his being  introduced here, is, his having written    Nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, consisting of a Masque and a Comedy,  [f]or the Great Royal Ball, acted in Paris six times by the King in  person, the Duke of Anjou, the Duke of York, with other Noblemen; also  by the Princess Royal, Henrietta Maria, Princess of Conti, &c. printed  in 4to. 1654, and addressed to the Marchioness of Dorchester. Besides  this piece, his Dodona's Grove, or Vocal Forest, is in the highest  reputation.    His entertaining letters, many of whom were written to the greatest  personages in England, and some in particular to Ben Johnson, were  first published in four volumes; but in 1737, the tenth edition of  them was published in one volume, which is also now become scarce.  They are interspersed with occasional verses; from one of these little  pieces we shall select the following specimen of this author's  poetical talent.                   On the Author's Valentine, Mrs. METCALF.      Could I charm the queen of love,    To lend a quill of her white dove;    Or one of Cupid's pointed wings    Dipt in the fair Caftalian Springs;      Then would I write the all divine      Perfections of my Valentine.      As 'mongst, all flow'rs the Rose excells,    As Amber 'mongst the fragrant'st smells,    As 'mongst all minerals the Gold,    As Marble 'mongst the finest mold,    As Diamond 'mongst jewels bright    As Cynthia 'mongst the lesser lights[3]:      So 'mongst the Northern beauties shine,      So far excels my Valentine.      In Rome and Naples I did view    Faces of celestial hue;    Venetian dames I have seen many,    (I only saw them, truck'd not any)    Of Spanish beauties, Dutch and French,    I have beheld the quintessence[3]:      Yet saw I none that could out-shine,      Or parallel my Valentine.      Th' Italians they are coy and quaint.    But they grosly daub and paint;    The Spanish kind, and apt to please,    But fav'ring of the same disease:    Of Dutch and French some few are comely,    The French are light, the Dutch are homely.      Let Tagus, Po, the Loire and Rhine      Then veil unto my Valentine.    Footnotes:  1. Langbaine's Lives of the Poets.  2. Athen. Oxon. p. 281. vol. ii.  3.
