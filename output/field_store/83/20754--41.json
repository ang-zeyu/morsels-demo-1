[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#6)"],[1,"  When Cicero began to write, the Latin language may be said to have been  destitute of a philosophical literature. Philosophy was a sealed study to  those who did not know Greek. It was his aim, by putting the best Greek  speculation into the most elegant Latin form, to extend the education of  his countrymen, and to enrich their literature. He wished at the same time  to strike a blow at the ascendency of Epicureanism throughout Italy. The  doctrines of Epicurus had alone appeared in Latin in a shape suited to  catch the popular taste. There seems to have been a very large Epicurean  literature in Latin, of which all but a few scanty traces is now lost. C.  Amafinius, mentioned in the _Academica_[113], was the first to write, and  his books seem to have had an enormous circulation[114]. He had a large  number of imitators, who obtained such a favourable reception, that, in  Cicero's strong language, they took possession of the whole of Italy[115].  Rabirius and Catius the Insubrian, possibly the epicure and friend of  Horace, were two of the most noted of these writers. Cicero assigns various  reasons for their extreme popularity: the easy nature of the Epicurean  physics, the fact that there was no other philosophy for Latin readers, and  the voluptuous blandishments of pleasure. This last cause, as indeed he in  one passage seems to allow, must have been of little real importance. It is  exceedingly remarkable that the whole of the Roman Epicurean literature  dealt in an overwhelmingly greater degree with the physics than with the  ethics of Epicurus. The explanation is to be found in the fact that the  Italian races had as yet a strong practical basis for morality in the legal  and social constitution of the family, and did not much feel the need of  any speculative system; while the general decay among the educated classes  of a belief in the supernatural, accompanied as it was by an increase of  superstition among the masses, prepared the way for the acceptance of a  purely mechanical explanation of the universe. But of this subject,  interesting and important as it is in itself, and neglected though it has  been, I can treat no farther.    These Roman Epicureans are continually reproached by Cicero for their  uncouth style of writing[116]. He indeed confesses that he had not read  them, but his estimate of them was probably correct. A curious question  arises, which I cannot here discuss, as to the reasons Cicero had for  omitting all mention of Lucretius when speaking of these Roman Epicureans.  The most probable elucidation is, that he found it impossible to include  the great poet in his sweeping condemnation, and being unwilling to allow  that anything good could come from the school of Epicurus, preferred to  keep silence, which nothing compelled him to break, since Lucretius was an  obscure man and only slowly won his way to favour with the public.    In addition to his desire to undermine Epicureanism in Italy, Cicero had a  patriotic wish to remove from the literature of his country the reproach  that it was completely destitute where Greek was richest. He often tries by  the most far-fetched arguments to show that philosophy had left its mark on  the early Italian peoples[117]. To those who objected that philosophy was  best left to the Greek language, he replies with indignation, accusing them  of being untrue to their country[118]. It would be a glorious thing, he  thinks, if Romans were no longer absolutely compelled to resort to  Greeks[119]. He will not even concede that the Greek is a richer tongue  than the Latin[120]. As for the alleged incapacity of the Roman intellect  to deal with philosophical enquiries, he will not hear of it. It is only,  he says, because the energy of the nation has been diverted into other  channels that so little progress has been made. The history of Roman  oratory is referred to in support of this opinion[121]. If only an impulse  were given at Rome to the pursuit of philosophy, already on the wane in  Greece, Cicero thought it would flourish and take the place of oratory,  which he believed to be expiring amid the din of civil war[122].    There can be no doubt that Cicero was penetrated by the belief that he  could thus do his country a real service. In his enforced political  inaction, and amid the disorganisation of the law-courts, it was the one  service he could render[123]. He is within his right when he claims praise  for not abandoning himself to idleness or worse, as did so many of the most  prominent men of the time[124]. For Cicero idleness was misery, and in  those evil times he was spurred on to exertion by the deepest sorrow[125].  Philosophy took the place of forensic oratory, public harangues, and  politics[126]. It is strange to find Cicero making such elaborate apologies  as he does for devoting himself to philosophy, and a careless reader might  set them down to egotism. But it must never be forgotten that at Rome such  studies were merely the amusement of the wealthy; the total devotion of a  life to them seemed well enough for Greeks, but for Romans unmanly,  unpractical and unstatesmanlike[127]. There were plenty of Romans who were  ready to condemn such pursuits altogether, and to regard any fresh  importation from Greece much in the spirit with which things French were  received by English patriots immediately after the great war. Others, like  the Neoptolemus of Ennius, thought a little learning in philosophy was  good, but a great deal was a dangerous thing[128]. Some few preferred that  Cicero should write on other subjects[129]. To these he replies by urging  the pressing necessity there was for works on philosophy in Latin.    Still, amid much depreciation, sufficient interest and sympathy were roused  by his first philosophical works to encourage Cicero to proceed. The elder  generation, for whose approbation he most cared, praised the books, and  many were incited both to read and to write philosophy[130]. Cicero now  extended his design, which seems to have been at first indefinite, so as to  bring within its scope every topic which Greek philosophers were accustomed  to treat[131]. Individual questions in philosophy could not be thoroughly  understood till the whole subject had been mastered[132]. This design then,  which is not explicitly stated in the two earliest works which we possess,  the _Academica_ and the _De Finibus_, required the composition of a sort of  philosophical encyclopaedia. Cicero never claimed to be more than an  interpreter of Greek philosophy to the Romans. He never pretended to  present new views of philosophy, or even original criticisms on its  history. The only thing he proclaims to be his own is his style. Looked at  in this, the true light, his work cannot be judged a failure. Those who  contrive to pronounce this judgment must either insist upon trying the work  by a standard to which it does not appeal, or fail to understand the Greek  philosophy it copies, or perhaps make Cicero suffer for the supposed  worthlessness of the philosophy of his age.    In accordance with Greek precedent, Cicero claims to have his oratorical  and political writings, all or nearly all published before the  _Hortensius_, included in his philosophical encyclopaedia[133]. The only  two works strictly philosophical, even in the ancient view, which preceded  the _Academica_, were the _De Consolatione_, founded on Crantor's book,  [Greek: peri penthous], and the _Hortensius_, which was introductory to  philosophy, or, as it was then called, protreptic.    For a list of the philosophical works of Cicero, and the dates of their  composition, the student must be referred to the _Dict. of Biography_, Art.  Cicero.    IV. _History of the Academica_.    On the death of Tullia, which happened at Tusculum in February, 45 B.C.,  Cicero took refuge in the solitude of his villa at Astura, which was  pleasantly situated on the Latin coast between Antium and Circeii[134].  Here he sought to soften his deep grief by incessant toil. First the book  _De Consolatione_ was written. He found the mechanic exercise of  composition the best solace for his pain, and wrote for whole days  together[135]. At other times he would plunge at early morning into the  dense woods near his villa, and remain there absorbed in study till  nightfall[136]. Often exertion failed to bring relief; yet he repelled the  entreaties of Atticus that he would return to the forum and the senate. A  grief, which books and solitude could scarcely enable him to endure, would  crush him, he felt, in the busy city[137].    It was amid such surroundings that the _Academica_ was written. The first  trace of an intention to write the treatise is found in a letter of Cicero  to Atticus, which seems to belong to the first few weeks of his  bereavement[138]. It was his wont to depend on Atticus very much for  historical and biographical details, and in the letter in question he asks  for just the kind of information which would be needed in writing the  _Academica_. The words with which he introduces his request imply that he  had determined on some new work to which our _Academica_ would  correspond[139]. He asks what reason brought to Rome the embassy which  Carneades accompanied; who was at that time the leader of the Epicurean  school; who were then the most noted [Greek: politikoi] at Athens. The  meaning of the last question is made clear by a passage in the _De  Oratore_[140], where Cicero speaks of the combined Academic and Peripatetic  schools under that name. It may be with reference to the progress of the  _Academica_ that in a later letter he expresses himself satisfied with the  advance he has made in his literary undertakings[141]. During the whole of  the remainder of his sojourn at Astura he continued to be actively  employed; but although he speaks of various other literary projects, we  find no express mention in his letters to Atticus of the _Academica_[142"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14975"],[0,"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (#6)"],[1," need to petition the  Legislature to repeal the law or raise money to file a suit. The railroad  corporations would be so effected they would in self-defense lobby to have  the separate car law repealed. On the other hand, as long as the railroads  can get Afro-American excursions they will always have plenty of money to  fight all the suits brought against them. They will be aided in so doing  by the same partisan public sentiment which passed the law. White men  passed the law, and white judges and juries would pass upon the suits  against the law, and render judgment in line with their prejudices and in  deference to the greater financial power.    The appeal to the white man's pocket has ever been more effectual than all  the appeals ever made to his conscience. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is  to be gained by a further sacrifice of manhood and self-respect. By the  right exercise of his power as the industrial factor of the South, the  Afro-American can demand and secure his rights, the punishment of  lynchers, and a fair trial for accused rapists.    Of the many inhuman outrages of this present year, the only case where the  proposed lynching did _not_ occur, was where the men armed themselves in  Jacksonville, Fla., and Paducah, Ky, and prevented it. The only times an  Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and  used it in self-defense.    The lesson this teaches and which every Afro-American should ponder well,  is that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black  home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to  give. When the white man who is always the aggressor knows he runs as  great risk of biting the dust every time his Afro-American victim does, he  will have greater respect for Afro-American life. The more the  Afro-American yields and cringes and begs, the more he has to do so, the  more he is insulted, outraged and lynched.    The assertion has been substantiated throughout these pages that the press  contains unreliable and doctored reports of lynchings, and one of the most  necessary things for the race to do is to get these facts before the  public. The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator  to compare with the press.    The Afro-American papers are the only ones which will print the truth, and  they lack means to employ agents and detectives to get at the facts. The  race must rally a mighty host to the support of their journals, and thus  enable them to do much in the way of investigation.    A lynching occurred at Port Jarvis, N.Y., the first week in June. A white  and colored man were implicated in the assault upon a white girl. It was  charged that the white man paid the colored boy to make the assault, which  he did on the public highway in broad day time, and was lynched. This, too  was done by \"parties unknown.\" The white man in the case still lives. He  was imprisoned and promises to fight the case on trial. At the preliminary  examination, it developed that he had been a suitor of the girl's. She had  repulsed and refused him, yet had given him money, and he had sent  threatening letters demanding more.    The day before this examination she was so wrought up, she left home and  wandered miles away. When found she said she did so because she was afraid  of the man's testimony. Why should she be afraid of the prisoner! Why  should she yield to his demands for money if not to prevent him exposing  something he knew! It seems explainable only on the hypothesis that a  _liaison_ existed between the colored boy and the girl, and the white man  knew of it. The press is singularly silent. Has it a motive? We owe it to  ourselves to find out.    The story comes from Larned, Kansas, Oct. 1, that a young white lady held  at bay until daylight, without alarming any one in the house, \"a burly  Negro\" who entered her room and bed. The \"burly Negro\" was promptly  lynched without investigation or examination of inconsistant stories.    A house was found burned down near Montgomery, Ala., in Monroe County,  Oct. 13, a few weeks ago; also the burned bodies of the owners and melted  piles of gold and silver.    These discoveries led to the conclusion that the awful crime was not  prompted by motives of robbery. The suggestion of the whites was that  \"brutal lust was the incentive, and as there are nearly 200 Negroes living  within a radius of five miles of the place the conclusion was inevitable  that some of them were the perpetrators.\"    Upon this \"suggestion\" probably made by the real criminal, the mob acted  upon the \"conclusion\" and arrested ten Afro-Americans, four of whom, they  tell the world, confessed to the deed of murdering Richard L. Johnson and  outraging his daughter, Jeanette. These four men, Berrell Jones, Moses  Johnson, Jim and John Packer, none of them twenty-five years of age, upon  this conclusion, were taken from jail, hanged, shot, and burned while yet  alive the night of Oct. 12. The same report says Mr. Johnson was on the  best of terms with his Negro tenants.    The race thus outraged must find out the facts of this awful hurling of  men into eternity on supposition, and give them to the indifferent and  apathetic country. We feel this to be a garbled report, but how can we  prove it?    Near Vicksburg, Miss., a murder was committed by a gang of burglars. Of  course it must have been done by Negroes, and Negroes were arrested for  it. It is believed that two men, Smith Tooley and John Adams belonged to a  gang controlled by white men and, fearing exposure, on the night of July  4, they were hanged in the Court House yard by those interested in  silencing them. Robberies since committed in the same vicinity have been  known to be by white men who had their faces blackened. We strongly  believe in the innocence of these murdered men, but we have no proof. No  other news goes out to the world save that which stamps us as a race of  cutthroats, robbers and lustful wild beasts. So great is Southern hate and  prejudice, they legally(?) hung poor little thirteen-year-old Mildrey  Brown at Columbia, S.C., Oct. 7, on the circumstantial evidence that she  poisoned a white infant. If her guilt had been proven unmistakably, had  she been white, Mildrey Brown would never have been hung.    The country would have been aroused and South Carolina disgraced forever  for such a crime. The Afro-American himself did not know as he should have  known as his journals should be in a position to have him know and act.    Nothing is more definitely settled than he must act for himself. I have  shown how he may employ the boycott, emigration and the press, and I feel  that by a combination of all these agencies can be effectually stamped out  lynch law, that last relic of barbarism and slavery. \"The gods help those  who help themselves.\""]]]
