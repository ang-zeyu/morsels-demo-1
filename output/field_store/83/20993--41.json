Perhaps India has not yet reached the high mark which our hopes have made  us expect, but the time still remains and the hopes of our Guardian are  anxiously turned to the educated, sincere and zealous fellow-brothers he  so much loves in India and Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    I have received lately your second letter dated June 10th enclosing the  list of the members of the newly-elected Indian Assemblies as well as the  report of the receipts and expenditures of the National Fund. Your loyal  and untiring attention to the pressing manifold requirements of our  beloved and steadily expanding Cause is a thing never-to-be forgotten and  worthy of unqualified praise. I trust you will continue to keep in touch  with the American National Assembly whose Secretary is only too anxious to  incorporate in the newsletter and the Year Book every bit of news  regarding the progress of the Faith in India & Burma.    July 14, 1927          Conduct of the Work of N.S.A.      He is very glad indeed to hear of the interview of Mr. Nabilzadeh with the  Governor of Burma. He will pray that the seeds he has sown will germinate  in the course of time and will prove of great benefit to our beloved  Cause.    Our Guardian hopes that henceforth the secretaries of all local and  national Assemblies will immediately upon their election inform the  American National Assembly of their membership and the address, that the  results may without delay be published in the Baha'i Year Book.    Our Guardian will not cease to pray for you all that the Beloved may guide  you to achieve that which will conduce to the consolidation and extension  of the influence of the Cause.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust the newly-elected Assembly will endeavour to follow the example of  the American National Assembly in method, action, and procedure. The  American Newsletter will indicate clearly the lines along which Baha'i  National Assemblies are to conduct their work in future and I earnestly  urge you to encourage the friends to follow and adopt the method outlined  in its columns.    August 19, 1927          Extend the Scope of Activities      For a country like India and also Burma where the Baha'i communities are  so much scattered and are of varied extraction a common centre to  coordinate the different efforts and to link up together both the  Assemblies within India and in the various parts of the world, is also ...  necessary, and our Guardian hopes and trusts to see in time great results  from this new measure. Of course much depends upon how well this organ  functions.    Shoghi Effendi is in good health having taken a good rest during the  summer. He awaits as much as ever the good news of the friends in India  and above all news of real accomplishment.    [From the Guardian:]    I hope that nothing has transpired of late that might have in any manner  affected the expansion of the work in those regions. I fully realize your  single-handedness in such a vast and varied field, but I assure you,  dearest friend, that your reward is proportionately great, for He that  watches over you is aware of the great devotion which animates you in the  pursuit of your arduous and noble task.    November 1, 1927          [Letter of November 16, 1927]      Your frequent communications keeping him in close touch with your  activities and the work in India, are deeply appreciated, and he relies  much upon your efforts to coordinate the work in India and to have more  direct and material results than we have been accustomed to lately. When  compared to some other countries and remembering the many years since the  Cause was first known there, India, I am afraid, does not come up to  expectations. Are we going to accept this secondary position or has the  future a surprise in store? At any rate we patiently wait.    November 16, 1927          [Letter of May 6, 1928]      He was greatly pleased with the news of the work of Prof. Pritam Singh in  Karachi and Lahore and he read his well-worded lectures with interest. It  gives him immense pleasure to keep in touch with his activities and he  prays for the success of his efforts from the bottom of his heart. He is  confident that when his plans are carried out and he does travel  throughout the whole of India in the interests of the Cause, he will show  a record of constant progress and would have rendered valuable services to  the Baha'i Faith. Please assure him of our Guardian's unfailing prayers  and good wishes and also kindly convey to the Amritsar Baha'is the loving  greetings of Shoghi Effendi...    I am sure it will interest you to know that we have had during the Ridwan  festivals the first Baha'i pilgrim from Tunis. The representative of the  Tunis Assembly is a young man full of hopes and schemes for the future.    [From the Guardian:]    I will specially supplicate, on behalf of my dear brethren in India &  Burma, at the Beloved's Shrine, that they may arise with heart and soul  and in perfect harmony and understanding to extend the scope of their  activities, to consolidate the foundations of their work, to deepen their  knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the Faith, and to carry  out the Beloved's explicit instructions for the establishment of  Baha'u'llah's undisputed sovereignty on this earth. May they be richly  blessed and guided in their endeavours.    May 6, 1928          [Letter of June 22, 1928]      Among the subjects that the Guardian would expect your body to take are a  coordination of the various efforts and endeavours throughout India and  Burma, an acceleration and increase in the number of Baha'is and  fellow-workers, ways and means to attract the attention of Indians from  every class and creed to the message and vital dynamic spirit of the  Baha'i Faith and as a cumulative and culminating step the final  recognition of the Baha'i Community as a separate religious organization  similar to what has been already achieved in America.    June 22, 1928          [Letter of August 21, 1928]      The news that we obtain from the various parts of the world are most  gratifying, for though there are some great problems to solve, yet no one  can fail to see the constant realization of those ideals we cherish. May  that day soon dawn when the source of this spiritual power, which is  permeating the whole of society, will be appreciated and venerated.    August 21, 1928          Present the Teachings at Various Conventions & Gatherings      This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ... reporting the events  of the Brahmo Samaj Centenary gathering to Shoghi Effendi. Such meetings  are wonderful occasions for showing the spirit and teachings of the  Cause.... Shoghi Effendi's hope is that at such Conventions and gatherings  the friends would present the teachings to persons otherwise inaccessible  for individual contact.    [From the Guardian:]    I heartily approve the project of a Baha'i Convention and would leave the  choice of the site and other arrangements to the National Assembly. The  Cause in various countries is making a great headway and the reference of  the case of the Baghdad House to the Mandates Commission of the League of  Nations is a great step forward.    October 10, 1928          The Faith Publicized in Turkey      He was glad to hear from you and he has read with deep satisfaction the  account of the good work of Syed Ilmi in Burma. Shoghi Effendi has always  wondered as to the reasons why despite so many years of effort and  activity, the Cause has not spread more rapidly either in India or Burma,  perhaps the latter can be more proud of its results. He would in fact  appreciate your own personal opinion, although God's ways are often hard  to understand. We have lately had a remarkable illustration in Turkey  where the Baha'is were an insignificant little group. Suddenly accused of  constituting a secret political society the members of the N.S.A. in  Constantinople and the S.A. in Smyrna were dragged to the police and kept  for one night pending the formation of the Board of Inquiry. The next day  the court sat and the president of the N.S.A. was cross-examined for eight  consecutive hours. The result was that they were all dismissed, with the  members of the Court deeply influenced and impressed by the teachings and  principles which the President boldly and eloquently described. They asked  for literature and many of them carried from that session much food for  thought. Furthermore every paper in Turkey filled its front pages with the  incident and a repetition of the teachings and good many a Turk heard of  the Cause in a way that Baha'is could never bring about.    [From the Guardian:]    I trust and pray that circumstances will be favourable and the means  provided for the holding of a Baha'i convention this year representative  of India and Burma. A closer touch and more frequent interchange of  thought among the Baha'i Centres in those lands are absolutely essential.  I am sending you a copy of the recently issued \"Baha'i World\", and wish  you to urge the National and Local Assemblies in India & Burma to order as  many copies as they possibly can from America for distribution among the  enlightened public as well as a means for the assistance and encouragement  of the Baha'i Publishing Committee in New York which is doing excellent  service at the present time.    November 15, 1928 Assemblies Must Endeavour to Inspire Confidence    Although I had never meant that my enquiry from you as to the reasons of  lack of progress of the Cause in India, should be asked from every  individual Baha'i, yet I am sure, our Guardian will be interested to know  the ideas and opinions of various sections of the friends both in India  and Burma.    The expression of our views in written form sometimes helps us to think  better and deeper and often brings various matters into proper  perspective,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#6)"],[1," your Assembly's question concerning a tie vote; as the  point raised is a secondary matter it is left to the discretion of your  N.S.A.    In the case of voting for less than nine individuals; it is not compulsory  that a ballot paper should contain necessarily nine votes. The individual  voter may record less than nine names, if he chooses to do so.    With renewed greetings and thanks from the Guardian to you and your  fellow-members in the N.S.A.,    Yours ever in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I am delighted with the manifold evidences of the progress achieved  through the concerted efforts of the Australian and the New-Zealand  believers under the able direction of their elected national  representatives. I feel proud of their accomplishments, highly approve of  their plans and projected enterprises, feel grateful for the spirit that  animates them, and cherish bright hopes for the extension of their  activities. May the Beloved guide their steps, cheer their hearts and  enable them to diffuse far and wide the teachings and spirit of His Cause.    Gratefully and affectionately,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF AUGUST 30TH, 1937      August 30th, 1937    Dear Miss Brooks,    Your letter of the 17th July enclosing Miss Ethel Dawe's communication  requesting permission to visit the Holy Land has been duly received by our  beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to inform you that, at your  suggestion, he has cabled Miss Dawe directly to London, extending to her a  hearty welcome to visit the Holy Shrines in the next fall.    He hopes that in the meantime nothing will happen to alter or upset her  plans, and that she will be given the privilege and joy of undertaking  this much-desired pilgrimage to Haifa.    Hoping this will find you and all the Adelaide friends in the best of  health, and with loving greetings to you and to them,    Yours ever in the Cause,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Wishing you success from all my heart, and assuring you of my continued  prayers for the realisation of your highest hopes,    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JANUARY 31ST, 1938      January 31st, 1938    Dear Miss Brooks,    The Guardian wishes me to express his loving thanks for your letter of the  third instant, enclosing the half-yearly reports of the Perth and Auckland  Spiritual Assemblies, all of which he has been delighted to read.    He wishes you to write the Auckland Assembly assuring them of his approval  of the request they have made on behalf of Miss Kitty Carpenter for  permission to visit Haifa. He has every hope that through this pilgrimage  she will be greatly refreshed and strengthened spiritually, and will upon  her return home impart to the friends in New-Zealand some measure of the  inspiration she will gain through close contact with the Holy Shrines.    Before closing the Guardian also wishes me to express the hope that your  N.S.A.'s plan of holding a meeting in Melbourne during the course of this  year may be realized, and that the occasion may serve to lend a fresh  impetus to the growth of the Cause in that city. He is fervently praying  for the success of your Assembly's efforts in this connection.    Reciprocating your greetings and with renewed and warmest thanks,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear co-worker:    The work in which you and your dear fellow-members are so devotedly, so  loyally and diligently engaged, is progressing in a manner that is highly  gratifying and merits the highest praise. I feel increasingly proud of,  and thankful for the achievements that signalize the rise of the  administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in Australia and  New-Zealand. Generations yet unborn will extol those qualities and virtues  that have enabled you all to render such great services to our beloved  Cause. Persevere, be happy and confident.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 30TH, 1938      March 30th, 1938    Dear Miss Brooks,    The Guardian was indeed pleased to receive your letter of the 16th ins.  informing him of Miss Dawe's safe arrival in Australia, and of the receipt  of the precious relic which he had asked her to present to your N.S.A. for  preservation in your National Archives.    He wishes you to assure your fellow-members of his full approval of their  suggestion to place this sacred relic in a little miniature frame case,  and in such manner as to keep the paper containing it from becoming soiled  and frayed with constant handling.    In connection with the article published in the October number of the  \"Herald of the South\" entitled \"Above the Mists\"; the Guardian wishes the  believers to disregard such subjects as psychic practices and phenomena,  for these besides not being authenticated by the Writings of the Founders  of the Faith, pertain mostly to the domain of conjectures. The magazine of  the \"Herald of the South\" should be devoted to the study and presentation  of those subjects that reflect the spirit of the Teachings, and which as  such are worthy of consideration by the believers. As the national organ  of the Australian and New-Zealand friends its main function is to assist  in disseminating the knowledge of the Cause, and thus develop into an  effective teaching medium. This is the goal which the editors should have  constantly in mind, and which they should endeavour to attain through the  best possible means they can devise at present.    The Guardian wishes me in closing to express his thanks for sending him  the reproductions of the Declaration of Trust certificate of your N.S.A.,  and for the reports of the Adelaide and Sydney assemblies, as well as the  photograph and report of the Yerrinbool Summer-School.    With his loving greetings to you and to your fellow-members in the N.S.A.,    Yours ever in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I am so touched by the repeated and compelling evidences of the  magnificent spirit that animates my dearly-beloved co-workers in Australia  and New-Zealand. The record of their manifold accomplishments warms my  heart and cheers my spirit. The Beloved is truly pleased with them and the  Almighty will surely bless and reinforce their high endeavours. May their  highest and dearest hopes be fulfilled in His Service.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF JUNE 22ND, 1938      June 22nd, 1938.    Dear Baha'i Sister,    I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to express his thanks for your  communication of May 14th, with the enclosed copy of the resolutions  passed by the Australian and New-Zealand N.S.A. in its April meeting held  in Melbourne. He has also noted with deep satisfaction the program of the  public meeting you had arranged on that occasion, and is very much  heartened to know that the response from the public has been most genuine  and quite beyond your expectations.    The general situation of the Cause in Melbourne, however, has caused  immense grief to his heart, specially as the believers themselves are  losing interest and seem to be drifting away. The decision taken by your  Assembly to hold the next Annual Convention there, with the view of  encouraging and guiding the friends to re-organise their activities, and  also in order to stimulate the progress of the teaching work in that  center is most splendid. The Guardian would strongly advise that in the  meantime every effort be exerted, through such means as the N.S.A. may  find feasible and effective, to bring back into the Community those  members who have already left, and to take immediate measures to  discourage those who contemplate doing so.    With reference to Miss Martha Root's projected teaching trip to your  shores; the Guardian highly appreciates the cordial invitation extended to  her by your Assembly, and has every hope that through her splendid zeal,  mature and wide experience in the teaching field, she will be able to lend  an unprecedented impetus to the expansion and consolidation of the  teaching work throughout Australia and New-Zealand during this coming  winter.    In closing I wish to convey through you to the newly-elected N.S.A. the  Guardian's heartfelt congratulations and sincere greetings, and to assure  them of his prayers, that throughout their new term of office, they may be  assisted in acquitting themselves befittingly of their task.    Also kindly extend to them his loving thanks for the expression of deep  sympathy which they have conveyed to him on their behalf, and in the name  of the believers in New-Zealand and Australia, in the passing away of the  Holy Mother, Munirih _Kh_anum.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I truly admire the manner in which the national representatives of the  believers of Australia and New Zealand are discharging their  responsibilities and fulfilling their vital and manifold functions. I,  moreover, feel eternally thankful for the spirit which the believers  themselves manifest, the support they extend to them, the vigilance,  steadfastness and self-sacrifice that distinguish the record of their  services. The foundations they are laying will endure and broaden as the  days go by, and the institutions they are erecting will multiply a  thousandfold if they persevere in the path they are now treading. The  blessing of the Abha Beauty will enable them to achieve still greater  victories if they refuse to hesitate and falter.    Gratefully,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF NOVEMBER 2ND, 1938      November 2nd, 1938    Dear Miss Brooks,    I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge with thanks your Assembly's  communication of October 6th.    Regarding the need you have expressed for a small, inexpensive prayer book  for use by the friends in Australia and New Zealand; he views with favour  this idea, but does not advise the use of the translations given in the  Baha'i Prayer"]]]
