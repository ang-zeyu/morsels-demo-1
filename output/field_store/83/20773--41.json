[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15262"],[0,"Christianity and Islam in Spain, A.D. 756-1031 (#6)"],[1," says Isidore of Beja, \"can describe such horrors! If every limb  in my body became a tongue, even then would human nature fail in  depicting this wholesale ruin of Spain, all its countless and  immeasurable woes. But that the reader may hear in brief the whole story  of sorrow--not to speak of all the disastrous ills which in innumerable  ages past from Adam even till now in various states and regions of the  earth a cruel and foul foe has caused to a fair world--whatever Troy in  Homer's tale endured, whatever Jerusalem suffered that the prophets'  words might come to pass, whatever Babylon underwent that the Scripture  might be fulfilled--all this, and more, has Spain experienced--Spain  once full of delights, but now of misery, once so exalted in glory, but  now brought low in shame and dishonour.\"[1]        [1] Cp. also Isidore, sec 36. Dunham, ii. p. 121, note,      curiously remarks: \"Both Isidore and Roderic may exaggerate,      but the exaggeration proves the fact.\"    This is evidently mere rhapsody, of the same character as the ravings  of the British monk Gildas, though far less justified as it seems by the  actual facts. Rodrigo of Toledo, following Isidore after an interval of  500 years, improves upon him by entering into details, which being in  many particulars demonstrably false, may in others be reasonably looked  upon with suspicion as exaggerated, if not entirely imaginary. His words  are: Children are dashed on the ground, young men beheaded, their  fathers fall in battle, the old men are massacred, the women reserved  for greater misfortune; every cathedral burnt or destroyed, the national  substance plundered, oaths and treaties uniformly broken.[1]    To appreciate the mildness and generosity of the Arabs, we need only  compare their conquest of Spain with the conquest of England by the  Saxons, the Danes, and even by the Christian Normans. The comparison  will be all in favour of the Arabs. It is not impossible that, if the  invaders had been Franks instead of Moors, the country would have  suffered even more, as we can see from the actual results effected by  the invasion of Charles the Great in 777. Placed as they were between  the devil and the deep sea, the Spaniards would perhaps have preferred  (had the choice been theirs) to be subject to the Saracens rather than  to the Franks.[2]        [1] Dunham, ii. p. 121, note.        [2] Dozy, ii. p. 41, note, quotes Ermold Nigel on Barcelona:              \"Urbs erat interea Francorum inhospita turnis,               Maurorum votis adsociata magis.\"    To the down-trodden slaves, who were very numerous all through Spain,  the Moslems came in the character of deliverers. A slave had only to  pronounce the simple formula: \"There is no God but God, and Mohammed is  his Prophet\": and he was immediately free. To the Jews the Moslems  brought toleration, nay, even influence and power. In fact, since the  fall of Jerusalem in 588 B.C. the Jews had never enjoyed such  independence and influence as in Spain during the domination of the  Arabs. Their genius being thus allowed free scope, they disputed the  supremacy in literature and the arts with the Arabs themselves.    Many of the earlier governors of Spain were harsh and even cruel in  their administration, but it was to Moslems and Christians alike.[1]  Some indeed increased the tribute laid upon the Christians; but it must  be remembered that this tribute[2] was in the first instance very light,  and therefore an increase was not felt severely as an oppression.  Moreover, there were not wanting some rulers who upheld the cause of the  Christians against illegal exactions. Among these was Abdurrahman al  Ghafeki (May-Aug. 721, and 731-732), of whom an Arab writer says:[3] \"He  did equal justice to Moslem and Christian ... he restored to the  Christians such churches as had been taken from them in contravention of  the stipulated treaties; but on the other hand he caused all those to be  demolished, which had been erected by the connivance of interested  governors.\" Similarly of his successor Anbasah ibn Sohaym Alkelbi  (721-726), we find it recorded[4] that \"he rendered equal justice to  every man, making no distinction between Mussulman and Christian, or  between Christian and Jew.\" Anbasah was followed by Yahya ibn Salmah  (March-Sept. 726), who is described as injudiciously severe, and dreaded  for his extreme rigour by Moslems as well as Christians.[5] Isidore says  that he made the Arabs give back to the Christians the property  unlawfully taken from them.[6] Similar praise is awarded to Okbah ibn  ulhejaj Asseluli (734-740).[7] Yet though many of the Ameers of Spain  were just and upright men, no permanent policy could be carried out with  regard to the relations between Moslems and Christians, while the Ameers  were so constantly changing, being sometimes elected by the army, but  oftener appointed by the Khalif, or by his lieutenant, the governor of  Africa for the time being. This perpetual shifting of rulers would in  itself have been fatal to the settlement of the country, had it not been  brought to an end by the election of Abdurrahman ibn Muawiyah as the  Khalif of Spain, and the establishment of his dynasty on the throne, in  May 756. But even after this important step was taken, the causes which  threatened to make anarchy perpetual, were still at work in Spain. Chief  among these were the feuds of the Arab tribes, and the jealousy between  Berbers and Arabs.        [1] _E.g._, Alhorr ibn Abdurrahman (717-719); see Isidore, sec.      44, and Conde, i. 94: \"He oppressed all alike, the Christians,      those who had newly embraced Islam, and the oldest of the      Moslemah families.\"        [2] Merely a small poll-tax (jizyah) at first.        [3] Conde, i. 105.        [4] Conde, i. p. 99. Isidore, however, sec. 52, says:      \"Vectigalia Christianis duplicata exagitat.\"        [5] Conde, i. 102.        [6] Isidore, sec. 54. Terribilis potestator fere triennio      crudelis exaestuat, atque aeri ingenio Hispaniae Sarracenos et      Mauros pro pacificis rebus olim ablatis exagitat, atque      Christianis plura restaurat.        [7] Conde, i. 114, 115.    Most of the first conquerors of the country were Berbers, while such  Arabs as came in with them belonged mostly to the Maadite or Beladi  faction.[1] The Berbers, besides being looked down upon as new converts,  were also regarded as Nonconformists[2] by the pure Arabs, and  consequently a quarrel was not long in breaking out between the two  parties.    As early as 718 the Berbers in Aragon and Catalonia rose against the  Arabs under a Jew named Khaulan, who was put to death the following  year. In 726 they revolted again, crying that they who had conquered the  country alone had claims to the spoil.[3] This formidable rising was  only put down by the Arabs making common cause against it. But the  continual disturbances in Africa kept alive the flame of discontent in  Spain, and the great Berber rebellion against the Arab yoke in Africa  was a signal for a similar determined attempt in Spain.[4] The  reinforcements which the Khalif, Yezid ibn Abdulmalik, sent to Africa  under Kolthum ibn Iyadh were defeated by the Berbers under a chief named  Meysarah, and shut up in Ceuta.        [1] The two chief branches of Arabs were (1) Descendants of      Modhar, son of Negus, son of Maad, son of Adnan. To this clan      belonged the Mecca and Medina Arabs, and the Umeyyade family.      They were also called Kaysites, Febrites, and Beladi Arabs. (2)      Descendants of Kahtan (Joktan), among whom were reckoned the      Kelbites and the Yemenites. These were most numerous in      Andalus; see Al Makkari, ii. 24.        [2] Dozy, iii. 124. See Al Makk., ii. 409, De Gayangos' note.      Though nominally Moslem, they still kept their Jewish or Pagan      rites.        [3] See De Gayangos, Al Makk. ii. 410, note. He quotes Borbon's      \"Karta,\" xiv. _sq._ Stanley Lane-Poole, \"Moors in Spain,\" p.      55, says, Monousa, who married the daughter of Eudes, was a      leader of the Berbers. Conde, i. 106, says, Othman abi Neza was      the leader, but Othman an ibn abi Nesah was Ameer of Spain in      728.        [4] Al Makkari, ii. 40.    Meanwhile in Spain, Abdalmalik ibn Kattan[1] Alfehri taking up the cause  of the Berbers, procured the deposition of Okbah ibn ulhejaj in his own  favour, but, this done, broke with his new allies. He was then compelled  to ask the help of the Syrian Arabs, who were cooped up in Ceuta, though  previously he had turned a deaf ear to their entreaties that they might  cross over into Spain.    The Syrians gladly accepted this invitation, and under Balj ibn Besher,  nephew of Kolthum, crossed the Straits, readily promising at the same  time to return to Africa when the Spanish Berbers were overcome. This  desirable end accomplished, however, they refused to keep to their  agreement, and Abdalmalik soon found himself driven to seek anew the  alliance of the Berbers and also of the Andalusian Arabs against his  late allies.[2] But the latter proved too strong for the Ameer, who was  defeated and killed by the Yemenite followers of Balj.        [1] Cardonne, i. p. 135.        [2] The Syrian Arabs seem to have borne a bad character away      from home. The Sultan Muawiyah warned his son that they altered      for the worse when abroad. See Ockley's \"Saracens.\"    These feuds of Yemenites against Modharites, complicated by the  accession of Berbers now to one side, now to the other, continued  without intermission till the first Khalif of Cordova, Abdurrahman ibn  Muawiyah, established his power all over Spain.    The successor of Balj and Thaleba ibn Salamah did indeed try to break up  the Syrian faction by separating them. He placed those of Damascus in  Elvira; of Emesa in Seville; of Kenesrin in Jaen; of Alurdan[1] in  Malaga and Regio; of Palestine in Sidonia or Xeres; of Egypt in Murcia;  of Wasit in Cabra; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#6)"],[1,"on prosecuting his journey without  further delay, he concluded to start at all hazards, notwithstanding the  dangers he apprehended from passing said town by daylight. For safety he  endeavored to hide his freight by having them all lie flat down on the  bottom of the skiff; covered them with blankets, concealing them from  the effulgent beams of the early morning sun, or rather from the  \"Christian Wolves\" who might perchance espy him from the shore in  passing the town.    The wind blew fearfully. Concklin was rowing heroically when loud voices  from the shore hailed him, but he was utterly deaf to the sound.  Immediately one or two guns were fired in the direction of the skiff,  but he heeded not this significant call; consequently here ended this  difficulty. He supposed, as the wind was blowing so hard, those on shore  who hailed him must have concluded that he did not hear them and that he  meant no disrespect in treating them with seeming indifference. Whilst  many straits and great dangers had to be passed, this was the greatest  before reaching their destination.    But suffice it to say that the glad tidings which this letter contained  filled the breast of Peter with unutterable delight and his friends and  relations with wonder beyond degree.[A] No fond wife had ever waited  with more longing desire for the return of her husband than Peter had  for this blessed news. All doubts had disappeared, and a well grounded  hope was cherished that within a few short days Peter and his fond wife  and children would be reunited in Freedom on the Canada side, and that  Concklin and the friends would be rejoicing with joy unspeakable over  this great triumph. But alas, before the few days had expired the  subjoined brief paragraph of news was discovered in the morning Ledger.    [Footnote A: In some unaccountable manner this the last letter Concklin  ever penned, perhaps, has been unfortunately lost.]          RUNAWAY NEGROES CAUGHT.--At Vincennes, Indiana, on Saturday      last, a white man and four negroes were arrested. The negroes      belong to B. McKiernon, of South Florence, Alabama, and the man      who was running them off calls himself John H. Miller. The      prisoners were taken charge of by the Marshall of      Evansville.--_April 9th_.      How suddenly these sad tidings turned into mourning and gloom the hope  and joy of Peter and his relatives no pen could possibly describe; at  least the writer will not attempt it here, but will at once introduce a  witness who met the noble Concklin and the panting fugitives in Indiana  and proffered them sympathy and advice. And it may safely be said from a  truer and more devoted friend of the slave they could not have received  counsel.          EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, MARCH 31st, 1851.        WM. STILL: _Dear Sir_ ,--On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to      you, written by Seth Concklin. I presume you have received that      letter. It gave an account of his rescue of the family of your      brother. If that is the last news you have had from them, I have      very painful intelligence for you. They passed on from near      Princeton, where I saw them and had a lengthy interview with      them, up north, I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes,      Ind., where they were seized by a party of men, and lodged in      jail. Telegraphic dispatches were sent all through the South. I      have since learned that the Marshall of Evansville received a      dispatch from Tuscumbia, to look out for them. By some means, he      and the master, so says report, went to Vincennes and claimed      the fugitives, chained Mr. Concklin and hurried all off. Mr.      Concklin wrote to Mr. David Stormon, Princeton, as soon as he      was cast into prison, to find bail. So soon as we got the letter      and could get off, two of us were about setting off to render      all possible aid, when we were told they all had passed, a few      hours before, through Princeton, Mr. Concklin in chains. What      kind of process was had, if any, I know not. I immediately came      down to this place, and learned that they had been put on a boat      at 3 P.M. I did not arrive until 6. Now all hopes of their      recovery are gone. No case ever so enlisted my sympathies. I had      seen Mr. Concklin in Cincinnati. I had given him aid and      counsel. I happened to see them after they landed in Indiana. I      heard Peter and Levin tell their tale of suffering, shed tears      of sorrow for them all; but now, since they have fallen a prey      to the unmerciful blood-hounds of this state, and have again      been dragged back to unrelenting bondage, I am entirely      unmanned. And poor Concklin! I fear for him. When he is dragged      back to Alabama, I fear they will go far beyond the utmost rigor      of the law, and vent their savage cruelty upon him. It is with      pain I have to communicate these things. But you may not hear      them from him. I could not get to see him or them, as Vincennes      is about thirty miles from Princeton, where I was when I heard      of the capture.        I take pleasure in stating that, according to the letter he      (Concklin) wrote to Mr. D. Stewart, Mr. Concklin did not abandon      them, but risked his own liberty to save them. He was not with      them when they were taken; but went afterwards to take them out      of jail upon a writ of Habeas Corpus, when they seized him too      and lodged him in prison.        I write in much haste. If I can learn any more facts of      importance, I may write you. If you desire to hear from me      again, or if you should learn any thing specific from Mr.      Concklin, be pleased to write me at Cincinnati, where I expect      to be in a short time. If curious to know your correspondent, I      may say I was formerly Editor of the \"New Concord Free Press,\"      Ohio. I only add that every case of this kind only tends to make      me abhor my (no!) _this_ country more and more. It is the      Devil's Government, and God will destroy it.        Yours for the slave, N.R. JOHNSTON.        P.S. I broke open this letter to write you some more. The      foregoing pages were written at night. I expected to mail it      next morning before leaving Evansville; but the boat for which I      was waiting came down about three in the morning; so I had to      hurry on board, bringing the letter along. As it now is I am not      sorry, for coming down, on my way to St. Louis, as far as      Paducah, there I learned from a colored man at the wharf that,      that same day, in the morning, the master and the family of      fugitives arrived off the boat, and had then gone on their      journey to Tuscumbia, but that the \"white man\" (Mr. Concklin)      had \"got away from them,\" about twelve miles up the river. It      seems he got off the boat some way, near or at Smithland, Ky., a      town at the mouth of the Cumberland River. I presume the report      is true, and hope he will finally escape, though I was also told      that they were in pursuit of him. Would that the others had also      escaped. Peter and Levin could have done so, I think, if they      had had resolution. One of them rode a horse, he not tied      either, behind the coach in which the others were. He followed      apparently \"contented and happy.\" From report, they told their      master, and even their pursuers, before the master came, that      Concklin had decoyed them away, they coming unwillingly. I write      on a very unsteady boat.        Yours, N.R. JOHNSTON.      A report found its way into the papers to the effect that \"Miller,\" the  white man arrested in connection with the capture of the family, was  found drowned, with his hands and feet in chains and his skull  fractured. It proved, as his friends feared, to be Seth Concklin. And in  irons, upon the river bank, there is no doubt he was buried.    In this dreadful hour one sad duty still remained to be performed. Up to  this moment the two sisters were totally ignorant of their brother's  whereabouts. Not the first whisper of his death had reached them. But  they must now be made acquainted with all the facts in the case.  Accordingly an interview was arranged for a meeting, and the duty of  conveying this painful intelligence to one of the sisters, Mrs. Supplee,  devolved upon Mr. McKim. And most tenderly and considerately did he  perform his mournful task.    Although a woman of nerve, and a true friend to the slave, an earnest  worker and a liberal giver in the Female Anti-Slavery Society, for a  time she was overwhelmed by the intelligence of her brother's death. As  soon as possible, however, through very great effort, she controlled her  emotions, and calmly expressed herself as being fully resigned to the  awful event. Not a word of complaint had she to make because she had not  been apprised of his movements; but said repeatedly, that, had she known  ever so much of his intentions, she would have been totally powerless in  opposing him if she had felt so disposed, and as an illustration of the  true character of the man, from his boyhood up to the day he died for  his fellow-man, she related his eventful career, and recalled a number  of instances of his heroic and daring deeds for others, sacrificing his  time and often periling his life in the cause of those who he considered  were suffering gross wrongs and oppression. Hence, she concluded, that  it was only natural for him in this case to have taken the steps he did.  Now and then overflowing tears would obstruct this deeply thrilling and  most remarkable story she was telling of her brother, but her memory  seemed quickened by the sadness of the occasion, and she was enabled to  recall vividly the chief events connected with his past history. Thus  his agency in this movement, which cost him his life, could readily  enough be accounted for, and the individuals who listened attentively to  the story were prepared to"]]]
