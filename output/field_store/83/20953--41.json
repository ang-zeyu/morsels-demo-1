The Albany Journal tells us of a dog in that city, who has formed the  habit of regarding a shadow with a great deal of interest. In this  particular, he is not unlike some people that one occasionally meets  with, who spend their whole time following shadows. The story of the  Albany editor is thus told: Those who are in the habit of frequenting  the post-office, between the hours of six and eight in the evening, have  doubtless noticed the singular wanderings of a dog near the first swing  door, without knowing the cause of his mysterious actions. The hall is  lighted with gas, and the burner is placed between the two doors. When  the outer door swings, the frame-work of the sash throws a moving shadow  on the wall, beneath the structure, which, from its peculiar movement  toward the floor, has attracted the notice of this dog. He watches it as  sharp as if it were a mouse, and although his labors have been  fruitless, yet he still continues nightly to grace this place with his  presence. Several attempts have been made to draw his attention from the  object, with but little success; for though his attention may be  diverted, it is soon lost, as the instant his eye catches the shadow, he  renews his watchings. In all his movements he is very harmless, and he  neither injures nor even molests those who have occasion to pass through  the hall.    As a farmer of good circumstances, who resided in the county of Norfolk,  England, was taking an excursion to a considerable distance from home,  during the frosts in the month of March 1795, he at length was so  benumbed by the intense cold, that he became stupefied, and so sleepy  that he found himself unable to proceed. He lay down, and would have  perished on the spot, had not a faithful dog, which attended him, as if  sensible of his dangerous situation, got on his breast, and, extending  himself over him, preserved the circulation of his blood. The dog, so  situated for many hours, kept up a continual barking, by which means,  and the assistance of some passengers, the farmer was roused, and led to  a house, where he soon recovered.          The Wolf.      From an authentic source I have obtained an incident of recent  occurrence, which painfully illustrates the fury of the wolf, while  engaged at a favorite meal. Near Lake Constance, in Canada, two men  observed some wolves engaged in eating a deer. One of them, named Black,  went to dispute the prize with these ravenous animals, when he  unfortunately fell a victim to his rashness, the wolves having devoured  him, leaving only a small portion of his bones.    Some three years since, while traveling in Canada, I met a lady who  resided with a brother in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company, a few  hundred miles north of Montreal. This lady informed me that she had not  unfrequently been chased by wolves, while proceeding to the house of her  nearest neighbor--about ten miles distant--and that a pack of them,  unusually hungry, once seemed very much determined to pull her from  her horse, though they finally made up their minds that they would try  their fortunes in another direction.    [Illustration: AN ADVENTURE WITH WOLVES.]    It sometimes, though not very frequently happens, that several wolves  together attack men who travel on horseback, and fight furiously. A  story is told of two men who were traveling in this manner in Mexico,  when two or three wolves, who, one would suppose, had fasted a good  while, fell upon the men and their horses, and it was a matter of some  doubt, for a time, who would be the victors, the travelers or their  assailants. The former were armed with pistols, too. The wolves got the  worst of the battle, however, at last, and they retreated, as men very  often do when they go to war with each other--having gained nothing but  a broken limb or two, which they boast of for the remainder of their  lives.    A peasant in Russia was one day riding along, when he found that he was  pursued by eleven wolves. Being about two miles from home he urged his  horse to the very extent of his speed. At the entrance to his residence  was a gate, which being shut at the time, the frightened horse dashed  open, and carried his master safely into the yard. Nine of the wolves  followed the man and his horse into the inclosure, when fortunately,  the gate swung back, and caught them all as it were in a trap. Finding  themselves caught in this manner, the wolves seemed to lose all their  courage and ferocity. They shrunk away, and tried to hide themselves  instead of pursuing their prey, and they were all killed with very  little difficulty.    The following story of an encounter with a saucy wolf in the  south-western part of the United States, is taken from the journal of a  Santa Fe trader: \"I shall not soon forget an adventure with a furious  wolf, many years ago, on the frontiers of Missouri. Riding near the  prairie border, I perceived one of the largest and fiercest of the gray  species, which had just descended from the west, and seemed famished to  desperation. I at once prepared for a chase; and being without arms, I  caught up a cudgel, when I betook me valiantly to the charge, much  stronger, as I soon discovered, in my cause than in my equipment. The  wolf was in no humor to flee, however, but boldly met me full half way.  I was soon disarmed, for my club broke upon the animal's head. He then  'laid to' my horse's legs, which, not relishing the conflict, gave a  plunge, and sent me whirling over his head, and made his escape, leaving  me and the wolf at close quarters. I was no sooner upon my feet than my  antagonist renewed the charge; but being without a weapon, or any means  of awakening an emotion of terror, save through his imagination, I took  off my large black hat, and using it for a shield, began to thrust it  toward his gaping jaws. My _ruse_ had the desired effect; for after  springing at me a few times, he wheeled about, and trotted off several  paces, and stopped to gaze at me. Being apprehensive that he might  change his mind, and return to the attack, and conscious that, under the  compromise, I had the best of the bargain, I very resolutely took to my  heels, glad of the opportunity of making a drawn game,[1] though I had  myself given the challenge.\" A friend of mine, who visited Texas a  little while ago, gives quite an interesting account of a ride he had  through an uninhabited part of that country, where wolves were abundant.  He says: \"As there was no road, I was obliged to take the prairie. My  conveyance was a mule, which is, by the way, the best for a long journey  in this country, as it is far more capable of endurance than a horse.  When I had rode about five miles, I found that I had lost my course; and  as the sun was clouded, I had no means of guessing at the route. But I  pushed on, and soon found myself in a dense grove of live oak. Here I  heard a distinct barking, and thought I must be near a house. I rode  toward the place whence the noise seemed to proceed, but soon found that  I had committed a most egregious error; for I was in the very midst of a  pack of wolves, consisting of about a dozen. As you may suppose, I was  terribly frightened, though I had heard that wolves in the country  seldom molest any one traveling on horseback. Still, this interesting  party appeared singularly fierce and hungry, and I opened a large clasp  knife, the only available weapon I had, in order to be prepared for the  contemplated attack. In this way I rode on about a mile, with the wolves  after me, when the whole force quietly dispersed. After riding about  three hours more, I discovered that I had been on the wrong track all  the time, though I was not sure where I was; but it was so dark it was  not safe to go further. So I spread my cloak on the grass, tied my mule  up to a tree, made my saddle into a pillow, and, thus prepared, lay down  for the night. I thought of wolves and snakes for some time, but being  very tired, soon went to sleep.\"    [Footnote 1: A drawn game at chess, as some of my readers may not be  aware, is one in which neither party is the victor.]    The wolf is capable of strong attachments, and has been known to cherish  the memory of a friend for a great length of time. A wolf belonging to  the menagerie in London, met his old keeper, after three years' absence.  It was evening when the man returned, and the wolf's den was shut up  from any external observation; yet the instant the man's voice was  heard, the faithful animal set up the most anxious cries; and the door  of his cage being opened, he rushed toward his friend, leaped upon his  shoulders, licked his face, and threatened to bite his keepers on their  attempting to separate them. When the man ultimately went away, he fell  sick, was long on the verge of death, and would never after permit a  stranger to approach him.    Captain Franklin, in his journal of a voyage in the Polar seas, mentions  seeing white wolves there, and gives an account which shows the wolf to  be quite a cunning animal. A number of deer, says the captain, were  feeding on a high cliff, when a multitude of wolves slily encircled the  place, and then rushed upon the deer, scaring them over the precipice,  where they were crushed to death by the fall. The wolves then came down,  and devoured the deer at their leisure.    [Illustration: SCENE IN THE OLD WOLF STORY.]    When I was quite a little boy, it used to be the fashion for many people  to fill children's heads with all manner of frightful stories about  wolves, and bears, and gentry of that sort--stories that had not a word  of truth in them, and which did a great deal of mischief. I remember to  this day, the horror I used to have, when obliged to go away alone in  the dark. Many a time I have looked behind me, thinking it quite likely  that a furious wolf was at my heels."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#6)"],[1," VIII).    *Disappearance and Origin of Red Corpuscles.*--The red corpuscles, being  cells without nuclei, are necessarily short-lived. It has been estimated  that during a period of one to two months, all the red corpuscles in the  body at a given time will have disappeared and their places taken by new  ones. The origin of new corpuscles, however, and the manner of ridding the  blood of old ones are problems that are not as yet fully solved. The  removal of the products of broken down corpuscles is supposed to take  place both in the liver and in the spleen.(9)    Regarding the origin of the red corpuscles, the evidence now seems  conclusive that large numbers of them are formed in the red marrow of the  bones. The red marrow is located in what is known as the spongy substance  of the bones (Chapter XIV) and consists, to a large extent, of cells  somewhat like the red corpuscles, but differing from them in having  nuclei. These appear to be constantly in a state of reproduction. The  blood, flowing through the minute cavities containing these cells, carries  those that have been loosened out into the blood stream. Nuclei appear in  the red corpuscles at the time of their formation, but these quickly  separate and, according to some authorities, form the blood platelets.    *White Corpuscles.*--The white corpuscles, or _leucocytes_, are cells of a  general spherical shape, each containing one, two, or more nuclei. They  are much less numerous than the red, there being on the average only one  white corpuscle to about every five hundred of the red ones. On the other  hand, the white corpuscles are larger than the red, one of the former  being equal in volume to about three of the latter.                                    [Fig. 10]      Fig. 10--*Escape of white corpuscles from a small blood vessel* (Hall). At       _A_ the conditions are normal, but at _B_ some excitation in the   surrounding tissue leads to a migration of corpuscles. 1, 2, and 3 show                       different stages of the passage.      The white corpuscles are found, when studied under favorable conditions,  to possess the power of changing their shape and, by this means, of moving  from place to place. This property enables them to penetrate the walls of  capillaries and to pass with the lymph in between the cells of the  tissues. The white corpuscles are, therefore, not confined to the blood  vessels, as are the red corpuscles, but migrate through the intercellular  spaces (Fig. 10). If any part of the body becomes inflamed, the white  corpuscles collect there in large numbers; and, on breaking down, they  form most of the white portion of the sore, called the _pus_.    New white corpuscles are formed from old ones, by cell-division. Their  production may occur in almost any part of the body, but usually takes  place in the lymphatic glands (Chapter VI) and in the spleen, where  conditions for their development are especially favorable. In these places  they are found in great abundance and in various stages of development.    *Functions of White Corpuscles.*--The main use of the white corpuscles  appears to be that of a destroyer of disease germs. These consist of  minute organisms that find their way into the body and, by living upon the  tissues and fluids and by depositing toxins (poisons) in them, cause  different forms of disease. Besides destroying germs that may be present  in the blood, the white corpuscles also leave the blood and attack germs  that have invaded the cells. By forming a kind of wall around any foreign  substance, such as a splinter, that has penetrated the skin, they are able  to prevent the spread of germs through the body. In a similar manner they  also prevent the germs from boils, abscesses, and sore places in general  from getting to and infecting other parts of the body.(10) Another  function ascribed to the white corpuscles is that of aiding in the  coagulation of the blood (page 31); and still another, of aiding in the  healing of wounds.    *Plasma.*--The plasma is a complex liquid, being made up of water and of  substances dissolved in the water. The dissolved substances consist mainly  of foods for the cells and wastes from the cells.    1. _The foods_ represent the same classes of materials as are taken in the  daily fare, _i.e._, proteids, carbohydrates, fats, and salts (Chapter IX).  Three kinds of proteids are found in the plasma, called _serum albumin_,  _serum globulin_, and _fibrinogen_. These resemble, in a general way, the  white of raw egg, but differ from each other in the readiness with which  they coagulate. Fibrinogen coagulates more readily than the others and is  the only one that changes in the ordinary coagulation of the blood. The  others remain dissolved during this process, but are coagulated by  chemical agents and by heat. While all of the proteids probably serve as  food for the cells, the fibrinogen, in addition, is a necessary factor in  the coagulation of the blood (page 31).    The only representative of the carbohydrates in the plasma is _dextrose_.  This is a variety of sugar, being derived from starch and the different  sugars that are eaten. The _fat_ in the plasma is in minute quantities and  appears as fine droplets--the form in which it is found in milk. While  several mineral salts are present in small quantities in the plasma,  _sodium chloride_, or common salt, is the only one found in any  considerable amount. The mineral salts serve various purposes, one of  which is to cause the proteids to dissolve in the plasma.    2. _The wastes_ are formed at the cells, whence they are passed by the  lymph into the blood plasma. They are carried by the blood until removed  by the organs of excretion. The two waste products found in greatest  abundance in the plasma are carbon dioxide and urea.    The substances dissolved in the plasma form about 10 per cent of the whole  amount. The remaining 90 per cent is water. Practically all the  constituents of the plasma, except the wastes, enter the blood from the  digestive organs.    *Purposes of Water in the Blood.*--Not only is water the most abundant  constituent of the blood; it is, in some respects, the most important. It  is the liquefying portion of the blood, holding in solution the  constituents of the plasma and floating the corpuscles. Deprived of its  water, the blood becomes a solid substance. Through the movements of the  blood the water also serves the purpose of a transporting agent in the  body. The cells in all parts of the body require water and this is  supplied to them from the blood. Water is present in the corpuscles as  well as in the plasma and forms about 80 per cent of the entire volume of  the blood.    *Coagulation of the Blood.*--If the blood is exposed to some unnatural  condition, such as occurs when it escapes from the blood vessels, it  undergoes a peculiar change known as _coagulation_.(11) In this change the  corpuscles are collected into a solid mass, known as the _clot_, thereby  separating from a liquid called the _serum_. The serum, which is similar  in appearance to the blood plasma, differs from that liquid in one  important respect as explained below.    *Causes of Coagulation.*--Although coagulation affects all parts of the  blood, only one of its constituents is found in reality to coagulate. This  is the fibrinogen. The formation of the clot and the separation of the  serum is due almost entirely to the action of this substance. Fibrinogen  is for this reason called the _coagulable constituent of the blood_. In  the plasma the fibrinogen is in a liquid form; but during coagulation it  changes into a white, stringy solid, called _fibrin_. This appears in the  clot and is the cause of its formation. Forming as a network of  exceedingly fine and very delicate threads (Fig. 11) _throughout the mass  of blood_ that is coagulating, the fibrin first entangles the corpuscles  and then, by contracting, draws them into the solid mass or clot.(12) The  contracting of the fibrin also squeezes out the serum. This liquid  contains all the constituents of the plasma except the fibrinogen.                                    [Fig. 11]       Fig. 11--*Fibrin threads* (after Ranvier). These by contracting draw the                    corpuscles together and form the clot.      *Fibrin Ferment and Calcium.*--Most difficult of all to answer have been  the questions: What causes the blood to coagulate outside of the blood  vessels and what prevents its coagulation inside of these vessels? The  best explanation offered as yet upon this point is as follows: Fibrinogen  does not of itself change into fibrin, but is made to undergo this change  by the presence of another substance, called _fibrin ferment_. This  substance is not a regular constituent of the blood, but is formed as  occasion requires. It is supposed to result from the breaking down of the  white corpuscles, and perhaps also from the blood platelets, when the  blood is exposed to unnatural conditions. The formation of the ferment  leads in turn to the changing of the fibrinogen into fibrin.    Another substance which is necessary to the process of coagulation is the  element calcium. If compounds of calcium are absent from the blood,  coagulation does not take place. These are, however, regular constituents  of healthy blood. Whether the presence of the calcium is necessary to the  formation of the ferment or to the action of the ferment upon the  fibrinogen is unknown.    *Purpose of Coagulation.*--The purpose of coagulation is to check the flow  of blood from wounds. The fact that the blood is contained in and kept  flowing continuously through a system of _connected_ vessels causes it to  escape rapidly from the body whenever openings in these vessels are made.  Clots form at such openings and close them up, stopping in this way the  flow that would otherwise go on indefinitely. Coagulation, however, does  not stop the flow of blood from "]]]
