He had  happened to be at Boulogne in pursuit of a little combined French and  seasiding at the time of the first congress held there, 1905. One day  he got his tongue badly tied up in a cafe, and was helped out of his  linguistic difficulties with the waiter by certain compatriots, who wore  green stars in their buttonholes,[2] and sat at another table conversing  in an unknown lingo with a crowd of foreigners. He made inquiries, and  found it was Esperanto they were talking. He was so much struck by their  facility, and the practical way in which they had set his business to  rights in a minute (the waiter was an Esperantist trained _ad hoc_!),  that he decided to give up French and go in for Esperanto. This man  was a real learner of French, who had spent a long time on it, and  realized with disgust his impotence to wield it practically. To judge  by his conversation next year at Geneva, he had no such difficulty with  Esperanto. He was quite jubilant over the change.       [1]Terse Esperanto word. = partisans of the same idea (i.e.     Esperanto).       [2]The Esperanto badge.    Such examples could be multiplied _ad infinitum_. No one who attended a  congress could fail to be convinced.    Scientific comparison of the respective difficulty of Esperanto and  other languages, based on properly collected and tabulated results,  does not seem to be yet obtainable. It is difficult to get high-class  schools, where language-teaching is a regular and important part of  the curriculum, to give an artificial language a fair trial. Properly  organized and carried-out tests are greatly to be desired. If and when  they are made, it will probably be found that Esperanto is not only very  easy of acquisition itself, but that it has a beneficial effect upon  other language-learning.[1]       [1]See pp. 145-55 [Part III, Chapter I].    Meantime, the present writer has carried out one small experiment in a  good secondary school for girls, where French and German are regularly  spoken and taught for many hours in the week. The head-mistress  introduced Esperanto as a regular school subject at the beginning of  the Easter term, January 1907. At the end of term a test paper was  set, consisting of English sentences to be rendered into French and  Esperanto without any dictionary or other aid, and one short passage  of English prose to be rendered into both languages with any aid from  books that the pupils wished. The object was to determine how far a few  hours' teaching of Esperanto would produce results comparable with those  obtained in a language learnt for years.    The examinees ranged from fourteen to sixteen years. They had been  learning French from two to seven years, and had a daily French lesson,  besides speaking French on alternate days in the school. They had learnt  Esperanto for ten weeks, from one to one and a half hours per week.  _Taking the papers all through, the Esperanto results were nearly as  good as the French._    One last experiment may be mentioned. It was made under scientific  conditions on September 23, 1905. The subject was an adult, who had  learnt French and German for years at school, and had since taught  French to young boys, but was not a linguist by training or education,  having read mathematics at the university.    He had had no lessons in Esperanto, and had never studied the language,  his sole knowledge of it being derived from general conversation with  an enthusiast, who had just returned from the Geneva Congress. He  was disposed to laugh at Esperanto, but was persuaded to test its  possibilities as a language that can be written intelligibly by an  educated person merely from dictionary by a few rules.    He was given a page of carefully prepared English to translate into  Esperanto. The following written aids were given:       1. Twenty-five crude roots (e.g. _lern-_ = to learn.)       2. One suffix, with explanation of its use.       3. A one-page complete grammar of the Esperanto language.       4. An Esperanto-English and an English-Esperanto dictionary.    He produced a good page of perfectly intelligible Esperanto, quite  free from serious grammatical mistake. He admitted that he could not  translate the passage so well into French or German.    Such experiments go a good way towards proving the case for an  artificial language. More are urgently needed, especially of the last  two types. They serve to convince all those who come within range of the  experiment that an artificial language is a serious project, and may  confer great benefits at small cost. Any one can make them with a little  trouble, if he can secure a victim. A particularly interesting one is  to send a letter in Esperanto to some English or foreign correspondent,  enclosing a penny key. The letter will certainly be understood, and very  likely the answer will be in Esperanto.    Doubters as to the ease and efficacy of a universal language are not  asked to believe without trial. They are merely asked not to condemn or  be unfavourable until they have a right to an opinion on the subject.  And they are asked to _form_ an opinion by personally testing, or at any  rate by weighing actual facts. \"A fair field and no favour.\"    The very best way of testing the thing is to study the language for a  few hours and attend a congress. The next congress is to be held in  Cambridge, England, in August 1907.    Nothing is more unscientific or unintelligent than to scoff at a thing,  while refusing to examine whether there is anything in it.                                         V          THE QUESTION OF PRACTICE (_continued_)--THE INTRODUCTION OF           AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE WOULD NOT CAUSE DISLOCATION    In Chapters II., III., and IV. it was sought to prove that a universal  language is desirable in principle, that it already exists and is  efficient, and that it is very easy. If these propositions are true,  the only valid argument against introducing it at once would be a  demonstration that its introduction is either impracticable or else  attended with such disadvantages as to outweigh the beneficial results.    Now, it is quite true that certain schemes tending towards international  uniformity of practice and, therefore, ultimately productive of saving  of labour are nevertheless such that their realization would cause an  almost prohibitive dislocation of present organization. A conspicuous  example is the proposed adoption of the decimal system in coinage and  weights and measures. So great is the loss of time and trouble (and  therefore of money) entailed by using an antiquated and cumbrous-system  instead of a simple and modern one that does the work as well, that the  big firm Kynochs some months ago introduced the decimal system, in spite  of the enormous difficulty of having to keep a double method going.  But hitherto, at any rate, the great disturbance to business that the  change would cause has prevented it from being generally made. Both  this matter and the curiously out-of-date[1] system of spelling modern  English present a fairly close analogy to the multilingual system of  international intercourse, as regards unprofitable expenditure of time  and trouble.       [1]Out of date, because it has failed to keep pace with the change of     pronunciation. Spelling, i.e. use of writing, was merely a device for     representing to the eye the spoken sounds, so that failure to do this     means getting out of date.    But where the analogy breaks down altogether is in the matter of  obstacles to reform.    Supposing that all the ministries of education in the world issued  orders, that as from January 1, 1909, an auxiliary language should be  taught in every government school; supposing that merchants took to  doing foreign business wholesale in an auxiliary language, or that men  of science took to issuing all their books and treatises in it; whose  business would be dislocated? What literature or books would become  obsolete? Who, except foreign correspondence clerks and interpreters,  would be a penny the worse? Surely a useful reform need not be delayed  or refused in the interests of interpreters and correspondence clerks.  Even these would only be eliminated gradually as the reform spread.  There would be absolutely no general confusion analogous to that  following on a sudden change to phonetic spelling or the metric system,  because nothing would be displaced.    Look at the precedents--the adoption of an international maritime code,  and of an international system of cataloguing which puts bibliography  on an equal footing all over the world by means of a common system  of classification. Did any confusion or dislocation follow on these  reforms? Quite the contrary. It was enough for England and France to  agree on the use of the maritime code, and the rest of the nations had  to come into line. It would be the same with the official recognition  by a group of powerful nations of an auxiliary language. As soon as the  world recognizes that it is a labour-saving device on a large scale, and  a matter of public convenience on the same plane as codes, telegraphy,  or shorthand, it will no doubt be introduced. But why wait until there  are rival schemes with large followings and vested interests--in short,  until the same obstacles arise to the choice of an international,  artificial, and neutral language, as now prevent the elevation of any  national language into a universal medium? The plea of impracticability  on the score of dislocation might then be valid. At present it is not.  To have an easy language that will carry you anywhere and enable you to  read anything, it is sufficient to wish for it. Only, as we Britons are  being taught to \"think imperially,\" so must the nations learn in this  matter to _wish internationally_.

If you, AEschines, in particular, were persuaded' (and it was no  particular affection for me, that prompted you to give up the hopes, the  appliances, the honors, which attended the course I then advised; but the  superior force of truth, and your utter inability to point any course more  eligible') if this was the case, I say, is it not highly cruel and unjust  to arraign these measures now, when you could not then propose a better?    4. As the hour of conflict drew near' (and this was a conflict to be  dreaded even by him'), he began to waver, and to abate much of his  boasting.        CIRCUMFLEX. (31)    RULE XII.--The circumflex is used to express irony, sarcasm, hypothesis,  or contrast.    NOTE.--For the reason that the circumflex always suggests a double or  doubtful meaning, it is appropriate for the purposes expressed in the  rule. It is, also, frequently used in sportive language; jokes and puns  are commonly given with this inflection.      EXAMPLES. (31)    1. Man never is, but always to be, blest.    2. They follow an adventurer whom they fear; we serve a monarch whom we  love. They boast, they come but to improve our state, enlarge our  thoughts, and free us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give  enlightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves the slaves of  passion, avarice, and pride. They offer us their protection: yes, such  protection as vultures give to lambs, covering and devouring them.        MONOTONE. (32)    RULE XIII.--The use of the monotone is confined chiefly to grave and  solemn subjects. When carefully and properly employed, it gives great  dignity to delivery.      EXAMPLES. (32)    1. The unbeliever! one who can gaze upon the sun, and moon, and stars, and  upon the unfading and imperishable sky, spread out so magnificently above  him, and say, \"All this is the work of chance!\"    2. God walketh upon the ocean. Brilliantly     The glassy waters mirror back his smiles;     The surging billows, and the gamboling storms     Come crouching to his feet.    3. I hail thee, as in gorgeous robes,     Blooming thou leav'st the chambers of the east,     Crowned with a gemmed tiara thick embossed     With studs of living light.    4. High on a throne of royal state, which far     Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,     Or where the gorgeous east, with richest hand     Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,     Satan exalted sat.    5. His broad expanded wings     Lay calm and motionless upon the air,     As if he floated there without their aid,     By the sole act of his unlorded will.    6. In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds     On half the nations, and with fear of change     Perplexes monarchs.        III. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (33)    ACCENT.    That syllable in a word which is uttered more forcibly than the others, is  said to be accented, and is marked thus, ('); as the italicized syllables  in the following words:    morn'ing.     pos'si-ble.  ty'rant.      re-cum'bent.  pro-cure'.    ex-or'bi-tant,  de-bate'.     com-pre-hen'sive.    Common usage alone determines upon what syllable the accent should be  placed, and to the lexicographer it belongs, to ascertain and record its  decision on this point.    In some few cases, we can trace the reasons for common usage in this  respect. In words which are used as different parts of speech, or which  have different meanings, the distinction is sometimes denoted by changing  the accent.      EXAMPLES. (33)       sub'ject   sub-ject'     pres'ent   pre-sent'     ab'sent    ab-sent'     cem'ent    ce-ment'     con'jure   con-jure'      There is another case, in which we discover the reason for changing the  accent, and that is, when it is required by emphasis, as in the following:      EXAMPLES. (33)    1. His abil'ity or in'ability to perform the act materially varies     the case.  2. This corrup'tion must put on in'corruption.        SECONDARY ACCENT. (34)    In words of more than two syllables, there is often a second accent given,  but more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary  accent; as, em\"igra'tion, rep\"artee', where the principal accent is marked  ('), and the secondary, (\"); so, also, this accent is obvious, in  nav\"iga'tion, com\"prehen'sion, plau\"sibil'ity, etc. The whole subject,  however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.        EMPHASIS. (34)    Emphasis consists in uttering a word or phrase in such a manner as to give  it force and energy, and to draw the attention of the hearer particularly  to the idea expressed.    This is most frequently accomplished by an increased stress of voice laid  upon the word or phrase. Sometimes, though more rarely, the same object is  effected by an unusual lowering of the voice, even to a whisper, and not  unfrequently by a pause before the emphatic word.    The inflections are often made subsidiary to this object. To give emphasis  to a word, the inflection is changed or increased in force or extent. When  the rising inflection is ordinarily used, the word, when emphatic,  frequently takes the falling inflection; and sometimes, also, the falling  inflection is changed into the rising inflection, for the same purpose.    Emphatic words are often denoted by being written in italics, in SMALL  CAPITALS, or in CAPITALS.    Much care is necessary to train the pupil to give clear and expressive  emphasis, and at the same time to avoid an unpleasant \"jerky\" movement of  the voice.        ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS. (35)    Where the emphasis is independent of any contrast or comparison with  other words or ideas, it is called absolute emphasis.      EXAMPLES. (35)    1. We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.    2. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!    3. Arm, warriors, arm!    4. You know that you are Brutus, that speak this,     Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.    5. Hamlet. Saw, who?     Horatio. The king, your father.     Hamlet. The king, my father?    6. Strike--till the last armed foe expires;     Strike--for your altars and your fires;     Strike--for the green graves of your sites;     God, and your native land!        RELATIVE EMPHASIS. (35)    Where there is antithesis, either expressed or implied, the emphasis is  called relative.      EXAMPLES. (35)    1.  We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.    2.  But I am describing your condition, rather than my own.    3.  I fear not death, and shall I then fear thee?    4.  Hunting men, and not beasts, shall be his game.    5. He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the  sins of the whole world.    6. It may moderate and restrain, but it was not designed to banish  gladness from the heart of man.    In the following examples, there are two sets of antitheses in the same  sentence.    7. To err is human, to forgive, divine.    8. John was punished; William, rewarded.    9. Without were fightings, within were fears.    10. Business sweetens pleasure, as labor sweetens rest.    11. Justice appropriates rewards to merit, and punishments to crime.    12. On the one side, all was alacrity and courage; on the other, all was  timidity and indecision.    13. The wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool,  when he gains the applause of others.    14. His care was to polish the country by art, as he had protected it by  arms.    In the following examples, the relative emphasis is applied to three sets  of antithetic words.    15. The difference between a madman and a fool is, that the former  reasons justly from false data; and the latter, erroneously from just data.    16. He raised a mortal to the skies,      She drew an angel down.    Sometimes the antithesis is implied, as in the following instances.    17. The spirit of the white man's heaven,      Forbids not thee to weep.    18. I shall enter on no encomiums upon Massachusetts.        EMPHASIS AND ACCENT. (37)    When words, which are the same in part of their formation, are contrasted,  the emphasis is expressed by accenting the syllables in which they differ.  See Accent, page 33.        EXAMPLES. (37)    1.  What is the difference between probability and possibility?    2.  Learn to unlearn what you have learned amiss.    3.  John attends regularly. William, irregularly.    4.  There is a great difference between giving and forgiving.    5.  The conduct of Antoninus was characterized by justice and humanity;  that of Nero, by injustice and inhumanity.    6. The conduct of the former is deserving of approbation, while that of  the latter merits the severest reprobation.      EMPHASIS AND INFLECTION. (37)    Emphasis sometimes changes the inflection from the rising to the falling,  or from the falling to the rising. For instances of the former change, see  Rule II, and Exception 1 to Rule IV. In the first three following  examples, the inflection is changed from the rising to the falling  inflection; in the last three, it is changed from the falling to the  rising, by the influence of emphasis.      EXAMPLES. (37)      1. If we have no regard for religion in youth', we ought to have respect  for it in age.    2. If we have no regard for our own' character, we ought to regard the  character of others.    3. If content can not remove' the disquietudes of life, it will, at least,  alleviate them.    4. The sweetest melody and the most perfect harmony fall powerless upon  the ear of one who is deaf',    5. It is useless to expatiate upon the beauties of nature to one who is  blind',    6. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,  because they are brethren'; but rather let them do them service.        EMPHATIC PHRASE. (38)    When it is desired to give to a phrase great force of expression, each  word, and even the parts of a compound word, are"]]]
