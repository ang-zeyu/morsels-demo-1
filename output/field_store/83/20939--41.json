In this tribe the cap is fleshy and  sticky (viscous), while the stem is firm and dry. In all Cortinarii the  gills become cinnamon-colored. There are many large-sized mushrooms in  this tribe, the cap sometimes measuring 6 inches across.    2. Myxacium = mucous. This tribe has the stem sticky (viscous), and the  universal veil is glutinous. The cap is fleshy but thin. Gills attached  to stem and decurrent.    3. Inoloma = fibre and fringe. It contains distinguished species. The  cap is at first silky, with innate scales or fibrils, is equally fleshy  and dry. The stem is fleshy and rather bulbous.    4. Dermocybe = skin and head. The cap and stem are both thinner in this  tribe than in Inoloma. The pileus becomes thin when old, and is dry, not  moist. It is at first silky. The color of the gills is changeable, which  makes it hard to distinguish the species.    5. Telamonia = lint. Pileus moist; at first smooth or sprinkled with  superficial whitish fibres of the veil. Flesh thin, or becoming so  abruptly at the margin; the veil is somewhat double, which is a  distinguishing characteristic of this tribe.    6. Hygrocybe = moist and head. Cap in this tribe is smooth or only  covered with white superficial fibrils, not gluey, but moist when fresh,  and changing color when dry. Flesh thin.      CLASS I. GASTEROMYCETES, OR STOMACH FUNGI.    The Basidia-bearing fungi, or Basidiomycetes, are divided into three  classes, as has been already stated. The third class, Hymenomycetes, or  Membrane fungi, has been described, but there remain two other groups of  which we will now speak more fully. They may be considered too difficult  for beginners, and we would not venture to enter further into the  subject were it not that some of the most familiar fungi belong to these  classes--such as Puff-balls, Morels, and Helvellas.    The first class, called the Gasteromycetes, or Stomach fungi, matures  its spores on the inside of the plant. The distinction between this  class and that of the Membrane fungi, which ripens its spores on the  outside, may be more readily understood by one familiar with the  structure of the fig, whose flowers are situated on the interior of its  pear-shaped, hollow axis, which is the fruit.    We will divide the Stomach fungi into four orders--1, the thick-skinned  fungi (Sclerodermae); 2, the Bird's-nest fungi (Nidulariae); 3, the  Puff-balls (Lycoperdons); 4, the Stink horns (Phalloidae.)      ORDER 1. SCLERODERMAE, THE THICK-SKINNED FUNGI.    Our attention will be confined to only one genus, and, indeed, one  species of this family. We often see in our walks what at a first glance  look like potatoes lying along the road, and the suggestion arises that  some careless boy has been losing potatoes from his basket on his way  home from the country store. We stoop to pick them up, and find them  rooted to the ground and covered with warts and scales. We cut them open  and find them a purplish-black color inside. It is a mass of closely  packed unripe spores. In a few days the upper part of the outside  covering decays, bursts open, and the ripe spores escape. This is called  the common hard-rind fungus, or Scleroderma vulgare.      ORDER 2. NIDULARIAE, THE BIRD'S-NEST FUNGI.    This is again divided into three genera. The Crucible (crucibulum), the  Cup (Cyathus), the Bird's-nest proper (Nidularia.)    We often find on a wood-pile or a fallen tree some of the members of the  Bird's-nest family. It is fascinating to examine them in their various  stages of development. First we see a tiny buff knot, cottony in texture  and closely covered; next, another rather larger, with its upper  covering thrown aside, displaying the tiny eggs, which prompts one to  look around for the miniature mother bird; then we find a nest empty  with the fledglings flown. The characteristic that distinguishes the  Bird's-nest fungi from others consists in the fact that the spores are  produced in small envelopes that do not split open, and which are  enclosed in a common covering, called the peridium. One species is known  by the fluted inside of the covering, which is quite beautiful. They are  all small and grow in groups.      ORDER 3. LYCOPERDONS, THE PUFF-BALLS.    The Lycoperdons contain several genera, among which we select the  Puff-balls proper and the Earth stars.    What child is there who lives in the country and does not know the  Puff-ball? With what gusto he presses it and watches what he calls the  smoke pouring from the chimney. Indeed, the outpouring of myriads of  spores in its ripe stage does suggest smoke from a chimney. The  puff-ball, when young, is of a firm texture, nearly round, grayish, or  brownish outside, but of a pure white within. There are several genera,  but we have selected two--1, Lycoperdon; and 2, Earth Star, or Geaster.    +LYCOPERDON = the puff-ball.+    The puff-balls vary greatly in size, the smallest measure 1/2 inch up to  the largest, about 15 inches. Professor Peck describes them thus:  \"Specimens of medium size are 8 to 12 inches in diameter. The largest in  the State Museum is about 15 inches in the dry state. When fresh it was  probably 20 inches or more. The color is whitish, afterward yellowish or  brownish. The largest size was called the Giant Puff-ball (Calvatia  bovista).\"    +GEASTER = the earth star.+    These vary greatly in size. The small ones grow on pine needles on the  ground or among leaves. Some are mounted on pedicels, some are sessile  or seated directly on the earth, but the family likeness is so  pronounced that even the novice need not be doubtful as to the name of  the fungus when found. There are two species that have slender,  elongated stems. The name is well chosen. In moist weather the points  expand and roll back or lie flat on the earth. Then the round puff-ball  in the centre is plainly seen.    In dry weather the star-like divisions are rigidly turned in and cover  closely the round portion. \"When dry it is sometimes rolled about by the  wind; when it is wet by the rain or abundant dew it absorbs the moisture  and spreads itself out, and rests from its journey, again to take up its  endless wandering as sun and rain appear to reduce it once more to a  ball and set it rolling.\" (Underwood.)      ORDER 4. PHALLOIDS, THE STINK HORN FUNGI.    We come now to the fourth and last order of the Stomach fungi  (Gasteromycetes) that we shall mention. In spite of their appellation  these fungi are strikingly beautiful, but their odor is most offensive.  They grow in woods, and are also found in cellars. Their history has  been carefully investigated by mycologists, and the novice will find  many beautiful illustrations in various works. In their early stage they  are enclosed in an egg-shaped veil (volva), having a gelatinous inner  layer. Some are bright-colored, others are pure white, and the stems of  one species look as if covered with lace work. The most familiar one,  Phallus impudicus, \"the fetid wood witch,\" we have placed in the list of  fungi at the end of this book, with its description.      CLASS II. ASCOMYCETES, OR SPORE SAC FUNGI.    This is the second division of the Basidia-bearing fungi. It includes  all the fungi that have the spores enveloped in delicate sacs called  asci. It is divided into several orders, but we will only mention the  one which contains the most familiar plants. This order is named the  Disc-like fungi (Discomycetes). In this the spore-bearing surface is on  the upper or outside surface of the mushroom cap. It is divided into  many genera, of which we shall mention three--the Cup fungi, or Pezizas,  the Morels or Morchellas, and the Yellowish fungi or Helvellas.    +PEZIZAS = the Cup fungi.+    These form a very large group, mostly growing on decaying plants. They  are typically disc-shaped or cup-shaped, and when young are closed or  nearly so, opening when mature. They vary in size from minute species to  large fleshy ones, 3 to 4 inches in diameter. They are generally small,  thin, and tough. They grow on twigs, leaves, dead wood, or on the  ground. Many are stemless. They are both solitary and densely clustered.  The color varies from pale brown to a dark gray, resembling, when moist,  india-rubber cloth, and then, again, there are many of brilliant  hues--red and orange. Some are erect, some are split down at the side  like the ear of a hare. The Cup fungi are found in August and September,  growing near ditches, and by the roadside where there is moisture. The  ear-shaped Pezizas somewhat resemble the Jew's ear, and the beginner  might easily confound them. This latter fungus belongs to the third  class of membrane fungi (Hymenomycetes), and it is included in the  descriptions of fungi.    +THE MORELS or MORCHELLAS = the honey-combed fungi.+    The collector during the months of April and May will enjoy a new  experience when he first finds a fungus of a bright brown color, deeply  pitted, spongy looking, cone-shaped or nearly round; its head supported  on an erect, white stem. He will probably find it on a grassy hillside  or along a running brook under some forest trees. He has perhaps seen  its picture and at once exclaims, \"my first Morel.\" He will notice its  peculiar honey-combed depression, and then cutting it open will find  both the head and the stem hollow. Where are the spores? There are no  gills as in the Agarics, nor are they concealed in a covering  (peridium), as in the Puff-balls, but they are contained in delicate  sacs on the cap. The exterior surface of the cap is the spore-bearing  portion, and the spores are developed in their sacs, but only seen under  a microscope.    +HELVELLA = the yellowish mushroom.+    This genus may be readily recognized by the form of the cap, which is  lobed and irregularly waved and drooping, often attached to the stem.  They grow on the ground in the woods, and sometimes on rotten wood.

When Dalgard could no longer hold open weary eyes, his last waking  memory was that of his companion sitting statue-still, his spear  across his knees, his head leaning a trifle forward as if what he  listened to was as vocal as the hum of night insects.    When the colony scout roused in the morning, his companion was  stretched full length on the other side of the spring, but his head  came up as Dalgard moved.    \"We may go forward without fear,\" he shaped the assurance. \"What has  troubled this land has gone.\"    \"A long time ago?\"    Dalgard was not surprised at Sssuri's negative answer. \"Within days  _they_ have been here. But they have gone once more. It will be wise  for us to learn what they wanted here.\"    \"Have they come to establish a base here once more?\" Dalgard brought  into the open the one threat which had hung over his own clan since  they first learned that a few of Those Others still lived--even if  overseas.    \"If that is their plan, they have not yet done it.\" Sssuri rolled over  on his back and stretched. He had lost that tenseness of a hound in  leash which had marked him the night before. \"This was one of their  secret places, holding much of their knowledge. They may return here  on quest for that learning.\"    All at once Dalgard was conscious of a sense of urgency. Suppose that  what Sssuri suggested was the truth, that Those Others were attempting  to recover the skills which had brought on the devastating war that  had turned this whole eastern continent into a wilderness? Equipped  with even the crumbs of such discoveries, they would be enemies  against which the Terran colonists could not hope to stand. The few  weapons their outlaw ancestors had brought with them on their  desperate flight to the stars were long since useless, and they had  had no way of duplicating them. Since childhood Dalgard had seen no  arms except the bows and the sword-knives carried by all venturing  away from Homeport. And what use would a bow or a foot or two of  sharpened metal be against things which could kill from a distance or  turn rock itself into a flowing, molten river?    He was impatient to move on, to reach this city of forgotten knowledge  which Sssuri was sure lay before them. Perhaps the colonists could  draw upon what was stored there as well as Those Others could.    Then he remembered--not only remembered but was corrected by Sssuri.  \"Think not of taking _their_ weapons into your hands.\" Sssuri did not  look up as he gave that warning. \"Long ago your fathers' fathers knew  that the knowledge of Those Others was not for their taking.\"    A dimly remembered story, a warning impressed upon him during his  first guided trips into the ruins near Homeport flashed into Dalgard's  mind. Yes, he knew that some things had been forbidden to his kind.  For one, it was best not to examine too closely the bands of color  patterns which served Those Others as a means of written record. Tapes  of the aliens' records had been found and stored at Homeport. But not  one of the colonists had ventured to try to break the color code and  learn what lay locked in those bands. Once long ago such an experiment  had led to the brink of disaster, and such delvings were now  considered too dangerous to be allowed.    But there was no harm in visiting this city, and certainly he must  make some report to the Council about what might be taking place here,  especially if Those Others were in residence or visited the site.    Sssuri still kept to the fields, avoiding the highway, until  mid-morning, and then he made an abrupt turn and brought them out on  the soil-drifted surface of the road. The land here was seemingly  deserted. No moth birds performed their air ballets overhead, and they  did not see a single hopper. That is, they did not until the road  dipped before them and they started down into a cupped hollow filled  with buildings. The river, whose delta they had earlier seen, made a  half loop about the city, lacing it in. And here were no signs of the  warfare which had ruined the port.    But in the middle of the road lay a bloody bunch of fur and splintered  bone, insects busy about it. Sssuri used the point of his spear to  straighten out the small corpse, displaying its headlessness. And  before they reached the outer buildings of the city they found four  more hoppers all mangled.    \"Not a snake-devil,\" Dalgard deduced. As far as he knew only the huge  reptiles or their smaller flying-dragon cousins preyed upon animals.  But a snake-devil would have left no remains of anything as small as a  hopper, one mouthful which could not satisfy its gnawing hunger. And a  flying dragon would have picked the bones clean.    \"_Them_!\" Sssuri's reply was clipped. \"They hunt for sport.\"    Dalgard felt a little sick. To his mind, hoppers were to be treated  with friendship. Only against the snake-devils and the flying dragons  were the colonists ever at war. No wonder that hopper had run from  them back on the plain during yesterday's journey!    The buildings before them were not the rounded domes of the isolated  farms, but a series of upward-pointing shafts. They walked through a  tall gap which must have supported a now-disappeared barrier gate, and  their passing was signaled by a whispering sound as they shuffled  through the loose sand and soil drifted there in a miniature dune.    This city was in a better state of preservation than any Dalgard had  previously visited. But he had no desire to enter any of the gaping  doorways. It was as if the city rejected him and his kind, as if to  the past that brooded here he was no more than a curious hopper or a  fluttering, short-lived moth bird.    \"Old--old and with wisdom hidden in it--\" he caught the trail of  thought from Sssuri. And he was certain that the merman was no more at  ease here than he himself was.    As the street they followed brought them into an open space surrounded  by more imposing buildings, they made another discovery which blotted  out all thoughts of forbidden knowledge and awakened them to a more  normal and everyday danger.    A fountain, which no longer played but gave birth to a crooked stream  of water, was in the center. And in the muddy verge of the stream,  pressed deep, was the fresh track of a snake-devil. Almost full grown,  Dalgard estimated, measuring the print with his fingers. Sssuri  pivoted slowly, studying the circle of buildings about them.    \"An hour--maybe two--\" Dalgard gave a hunter's verdict on the age of  the print. He, too, eyed those buildings. To meet a snake-devil in the  open was one thing, to play hide-and-seek with the cunning monster in  a warren such as this was something else again. He hoped that the  reptile had been heading for the open, but he doubted it. This mass of  buildings would provide just the type of shelter which would appeal to  it for a lair. And snake-devils did not den alone!    \"Try by the river,\" Sssuri gave advice. Like Dalgard, he accepted the  necessity of the chase. No intelligent creature ever lost the chance  to kill a snake-devil when fortune offered it. And he and the scout  had hunted together on such trails before. Now they slipped into  familiar roles from long practice.    They took a route which should lead them to the river, and within a  matter of yards, came across evidence proving that the merman had  guessed correctly; a second claw print was pressed deep in a patch of  drifted soil.    Here the buildings were of a new type, windowless, perhaps  storehouses. But what pleased Dalgard most was the fact that most of  them showed tightly closed doors. There was no chance for their prey  to lurk in wait.    \"We should smell it.\" Sssuri picked that worry out of the scout's mind  and had a ready answer for it.    Sure--they should smell the lair; nothing could cloak the horrible  odor of a snake-devil's home. Dalgard sniffed vigorously as he padded  along. Though odd smells clung to the strange buildings none of them  were actively obnoxious--yet.    \"River--\"    There was the river at the end of the way they had been following, a  way which ended in a wharf built out over the oily flow of water.  Blank walls were on either side. If the snake-devil had come this way,  he had found no hiding place.    \"Across the river--\"    Dalgard gave a resigned grunt. For some reason he disliked the thought  of swimming that stream, of having his skin laved by the turgid water  with its brown sheen.    \"There is no need to swim.\"    Dalgard's gaze followed Sssuri's pointing finger. But what he saw  bobbing up and down, pulled a little downstream by the current, did  not particularly reassure him. It was manifestly a boat, but the form  was as alien as the city around them.          4    CIVILIZATION      Raf surveyed the wide sweep of prairie where dawn gave a gray tinge to  soften the distance and mark the rounded billows of the ever-rippling  grass. He tried to analyze what it was about this world which made it  seem so untouched, so fresh and new. There were large sections of his  own Terra which had been abandoned after the Big Burn-Off and the  atomic wars, or later after the counterrevolution which had defeated  the empire of Pax, during which mankind had slipped far back on the  road to civilization. But he had never experienced this same feeling  when he had ventured into those wildernesses. Almost he could believe  that the records Hobart had showed him were false, that this world had  never known intelligent life herding together in cities.    He walked slowly down the ramp, drawing deep breaths of the crisp air.  The day would grow warmer with the rising sun. But now it was just the  sort of morning which led him to be glad he was alive--and young!  Maybe part of it was because he was free of the ship and at last not  just excess baggage but a man with a definite job before him.    Spacemen tended to be"]]]
