The compass and the North Star.]    Practise using the compass for a guide until you understand it; have  faith in it and you may fearlessly trust to its guidance. Try going  according to various points of the compass: suppose you wish to go  southeast, the compass tells you this as plainly as the north; try it.  Naturally, if you go to the southeast away from camp, returning will  be in exactly the opposite direction, and coming back to camp you must  walk northwest. After learning to go in a straight line, guided entirely  by the compass, try a zigzag path. A group of girls will find it good  sport to practise trailing with the compass, and they will at the same  time learn how to avoid being lost and how to help others find their  way. It is possible to      =Make a Compass of Your Watch=    Besides keeping you company with its friendly nearness, its ticking and  its ready answers to your questions regarding the time, a watch in the  woods and fields has another use, for it can be used as a compass. It  will show just where the south is, then by turning your back on the  south you face the north, and on your right is the east and on your left  the west. These are the rules:    With your watch in a horizontal position point the hour-hand to the sun,  and if before noon, half-way between the hour hand and 12 is due south.  If it is afternoon calculate the opposite way. For instance, if at 8 A.  M. you point the hour-hand to the sun, 10 will point to the south, for  that is half-way between 8 and 12. If at 2 P. M. you point the hour-hand  to the sun, look back to 12, and half the distance will be at 1,  therefore 1 points to the south.    An easy way to get the direction of the sun without looking directly at  it is by means of the shadow of a straight, slender stick or grass stem  thrown on the horizontal face of your watch. Hold the stick upright with  the lower end touching the watch at the _point_ of the hour-hand, then  turn the watch until the shadow of the stick falls along the hour-hand.  This will point the hand undeviatingly toward the sun.      =Mountain Climbing=    The campers should go together to climb the mountain, never one girl  alone.    Before starting, find a strong stick to use as a staff; stow away some  luncheon in one of your pockets; see that your camera is in perfect  order, ready to use at a moment's notice; that your water-proof  match-box is in your pocket filled with safety matches, your  pocket-knife safe with you, also watch and compass, and that the tin cup  is on your belt. Your whistle being always hung around your neck will,  of course, be there as usual.    When you are ready, stand still and look about you once more to make  sure of your bearings; close your eyes and tell yourself exactly what  you have seen. After leaving camp and arriving at the foot of the  mountain, take your bearings anew; then look up ahead and select a  certain spot which you wish to reach on the upward trail. Having this  definite object in view will help in making better progress and save  your walking around in a circle, which is always the tendency when in a  strange place and intervening trees or elevations obstruct the view, or  when not sure of the way and trying to find it.    Begin blazing the trail at your first step up the mountain side. Even  though there may be a trail already, you cannot be sure that it will  continue; it is much safer to depend upon your own blazing.    Often in trailing along the mountain you will find huge rocks and steep  depressions, or small lakes which you cannot cross over but must go  around, and in so doing change your direction, perhaps strike off at an  angle. Before making the detour, search out some large landmark, readily  recognized after reaching the other side of the obstruction, a tall,  peculiarly shaped tree or other natural feature. Now is the time to try  earnestly to keep the landmark in sight as long as possible and to be  able to recognize it when you see it again. Watch your compass and the  sun that you may continue in the right direction after circling the  obstruction. Go slow in climbing, take your time and don't get out of  breath.    On many mountains the possibility of unexpected fogs exists, and safety  requires that the party be linked together with a soft rope; the same  precaution should be taken when the trail is very rough, steep, and  rocky. The camper at the head of the line should tie the rope in a  bow-line around her waist, with knot on left side, and eight or ten feet  from her the next girl should link herself to the rope in the same  manner; then another girl, and another, until the entire party is on the  rope.    The leader starts on the trail and the others, holding fast to their  staffs, carefully follow, each one cautious to keep the rope stretching  out in front of her rather taut; then if one girl stumbles the others  brace themselves and keep her from falling.    When descending the mountain, be careful to get a firm footing. Instead  of facing the trail, it is safer to turn sideways, so that you can place  the entire foot down and not risk the toes only, or the heels. Often  coming down either a steep hill or a mountain is more difficult than  going up.      =Lost in the Woods=    It is not at all probable that you will lose your way while on the  trail, but if you should find yourself lost in the woods or in the open,  the first thing to do is to remember that a brave girl does not get into  a panic and so rob herself of judgment and the power to think clearly  and act quickly. Believe firmly that you are _safe_, then sit down  quietly and think out a plan of finding your way. Try to remember from  which direction you have come and to recall landmarks. If you cannot do  this, do not be frightened and do not allow any thought of possible harm  to get a foothold in your mind. If there is a hill near, from which you  can see any distance, climb that and get an outlook. You may be able to  see the smoke of your camp-fire, which, after all, cannot be so far  away. You may find a landmark that you do remember. If you see nothing  which you can recognize, make a signal flag of your handkerchief and put  it up high, as high as you can. Your friends will be looking for that.  Then give the lost signal, one long blast with your whistle, and after a  short pause follow with two more blasts in quick succession. If you have  no whistle shout, loud and long, then wait a while, keeping eyes and  ears open to see and hear answering signals. If there is none, again  shout the lost signal and continue the calls every little while for  quite a time. Another call for help is the ascending smoke of three  fires. This, of course, is for daylight. Build your fires some distance  apart, twenty-five feet or more, that the smoke from each may be clearly  seen alone, not mingled with the rest. Aim to create _smoke_ rather than  flame; a slender column of smoke can be seen a long distance, therefore  the fire need not be large. Choose for your fires as clear a space and  as high an elevation as can be found, and in the relief and excitement  of rescue _do not forget to extinguish every spark_ before leaving the  ground.    If you decide to keep moving, blaze your trail as you go, so that it may  be followed and also that you may know if you cross it again yourself.  You can blaze the trail by breaking or bending small branches on trees  and bushes, or by small strips torn from your handkerchief and tied  conspicuously on twigs. If you are where there are no trees or  undergrowth, build small piles of stones or little hills of earth at  intervals to mark your trail.    If night overtakes you, look for the _North Star_. That will help if you  know at what point of the compass your camp lies, and if you remember  whether your course in leaving camp was to the north, south, east, or  west, you can calculate pretty accurately whether the camp is to the  north, south, east, or west of you.    In case the night must be spent where you are, go about making a  shelter, prepare as comfortable a bed as possible, and do _not_ be  afraid. You will probably be found before morning, and you must be found  in good physical condition.    If you can kindle a fire, do it; that will help to guide your friends  and will ward off wild creatures that might startle you. Keep your fire  going all night and take care that it does not spread.    It is better to remain quietly in one spot all night than to wander  about in the dark and perhaps stumble upon dangerous places. If, when  you find the points of the compass by the _North Star_, you mark them  plainly on a stone or fallen log, they will be a ready guide for you as  soon as daylight breaks.    The last word on this subject is: _Do not be afraid_.      =To Find Your Way by the North Star=    At night you will have the same reliable guide that has ever been the  mariner's friend, and if you do not know this star guide, lose no time  in finding it.    Polaris or pole-star is known generally as North Star, and this star is  most important to the outdoor girl. At all times the North Star marks  the north, its position never changes, and seeing that star and _knowing  it_, you will always know the points of the compass. Face the North  Star and you face the north. At your right hand is the east, at your  left hand is the west, and at your back is the south.    The North Star does not look very important because it is not very  bright or very large, and were it not for the help of the Big Dipper,  which every one knows, the North Star would not be easy to find. The  diagram given on page 37 shows the relative position of the stars and  will help you to find the North Star. The two stars forming the front  side of the bowl of the Great Dipper point almost in a direct line to  the North Star, which is the last one in the handle of the Little  Dipper, or the tail of the Little Bear, which means the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18544"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#6)"],[1,". The Haussa has also the _g_ hard, as in _magaree_,  \"good;\" and a great number of words with the sound _tsh_, as _doutshee_,  a stone or mountain.    The Fellatah language is said to resemble the Kailouee; in other words,  to be a Berber dialect. If this be the case, the Fellatah people are  probably of Berber extraction, and not Arab, as they are vulgarly  supposed to be. This is a question requiring still further  investigation. Others, again, say that the Fellatah language is quite  different from the Tuarick. Overweg thinks Islamism was introduced into  Bornou by the Shoua Arabs, who are found in Bornou in great numbers. The  Fellatah, he thinks, received Islamism by way of Timbuctoo, from Moors  and Arabs trading to that city from Morocco. There is considerable  probability in both these opinions.    _15th._--Four or five days after the approaching Eed, or festival, half  the people of Tintalous will go for salt, and the other half prepare for  their annual journey to Soudan with En-Noor.    The inhabitants of Damerghou are reported to be half \"_Kohlan_,\" blacks,  and half Kailouees. It is the Kailouees in the neighbourhood of  Damerghou who infest the borders and routes of Bornou. En-Noor is now  very quiet, and there is a chance that he will not come down upon me for  more money.    According to the Fezzanees, Tuat is thirty days from Aisou and  thirty-three from Taghajeet (short days). Ghat is forty short and thirty  long days from Tintalous or Asoudee. Bilma is fourteen long and seven  short days from Tintalous or Asoudee. There is no direct route from this  (Tintalous) to Timbuctoo; from Sakkatou there is, however, a short route  to Timbuctoo, and it is said to be a safe one. The number of days here  mentioned are merely general numbers; they vary according to the good  state of the camels, or the disposition of the people, or certain  accidents on the road.    The evening of the feast of the \"Descent of the Koran from Heaven,\" all  good Muslims ought to sit up all night to read the Koran, through and  through again.    There is a curious commerce of yamanee, or agate stones, in  Soudan. These yamanee are originally brought from the eastern  coast of Africa, from and near Mombas (Mozambique), where they pass as  money, like the cowries. From Mombas they are carried, by the Muscat  traders, to Yamen, and thence to Mekka; in which place they are blessed,  and rendered doubly precious. From Mekka they are brought to Egypt, and  from Egypt to Mourzuk; from which point they are distributed all over  this part of Africa, and the souk of Kanou is stocked with them. They  are much esteemed by all classes of the inhabitants of the interior of  Africa, and are worn equally by the men and women.    In this commerce we see the round-about-way in which some articles are  conveyed for sale. If there were a road from Mombas direct to Bornou,  this agate would be cheap enough. But then, perhaps, it would not be  esteemed or valued at half its present cost. It would not be blessed at  Mekka, and so lose all its talismanic and mysterious power. The name is  derived from Yaman, evidently from the first country in Arabia, to which  they were brought originally from Africa.    According to Overweg, Madame En-Noor is still very unwell with her lip.  It is cut right across under her nose, penetrating to the gums; she is,  nevertheless, very lively, and is always pestering Overweg to read the  fatah with, or marry a young girl, one of her relations. She endeavours  to warm my worthy friend to comply with her match-making wishes by  luxurious descriptions of the beauties of the proffered bride.    As soon as the people hear I have a wife in Tripoli, they begin to ask  how many children I have got. On receiving for answer, \"None,\" they are  greatly astonished, and ask me the reason of so strange a matrimonial  phenomenon.    This evening another fine meteor appeared in the south-east. Its head  was like a blazing star, and it left behind it a train of sparkling  light and flame. There were also numbers of smaller meteors.    _16th._--The morning of the Eed. According to the Fezzanees, prayers are  soon ended; because, they say, \"these Kailouees know nothing of their  religion.\"    The Fezzanees asked me to hoist the British flag; to which I replied,  \"No; the flag belongs to the Queen, but I will give you a little powder  for your matchlocks.\" All these Mahommedan feasts are celebrated on the  northern coast of Africa by the discharge of gunpowder.    No certain information can be obtained of the route from Zinder to  Sakkatou, in this place. The people only say the present Sultan is not  so strong as was his father; thereby intimating that the routes are not  so secure as formerly.    It is usual for the inhabitants of Tintalous to visit those of Asarara  on the morning of the present feast. About sixty men, natives of this  place, accompanied by a dozen Moors from Tripoli and Mourzuk, went,  accordingly, to Asarara this morning. Then a number of the people of  Asarara returned with them. Yusuf remarked, with some surprise, that  even the women went out to pray, about forty in number. So that it would  seem the Kailouees educate their women in religion more than the Muslims  of the coast.    The most interesting event to us, however, this morning, was the arrival  of the boat from Seloufeeat. Our servants were very quick in their  return. They came all night, to avoid any further attempts to carry off  the camels. They were all alone. I welcomed the return of the boat as I  would that of an old friend.    There was no firing this evening, as was expected, En-Noor being very  unwell-suffering rheumatism and fever.    The most agreeable sight in all these Mahommedan feasts is to see all  the people dressed out in their finery. The merchants have appeared in  splendid burnouses, all more or less in good humour. The slaughtering of  the sheep to-day was the dirtiest part of the business. All here on such  occasions play the part of butchers-men, women, and children; and all  attack, stab, skin, and maul the poor animals, in a way frightful to  behold. The environs of the town were turned into dirty  slaughter-houses.    _17th._--I have determined to purchase no more things from the Sfaxee at  present. He makes me pay double price. It will be better to wait and see  what can be done at Zinder. An infidel traveller, who is known to be in  possession of any property, is sure in these countries to be looked upon  as a milch-cow. Does not \"the book,\" according to the vulgar opinion,  authorise the faithful to take our lives? \"Our purses are more lawful.\"    The festival being over, I went to pay my respects to Sultan En-Noor. He  is much better in health than yesterday, but has still a bad cold, and  continues to blow his nose and wipe it--pardon the _naive_  statement--with the sole of one of his sandals! The action struck me as  rather uncleanly and undignified in a prince; but Kailouees are not  punctilious.    Mr. Gagliuffi had mentioned to me that he had given assistance to some  shepherds who were begging their way to Soudan. One of these poor  fellows had come to see the Sultan. He seemed, indeed, miserably poor,  but tried to hide the fact, saying to them and Yusuf: \"I have news for  you; now I am your friend, as I was a friend to the Consul in Mourzuk.\"  He was quite a young man, and excited my compassion.    In the afternoon I received a visit from En-Noor, with a whole train of  his people. The Shereef was absent. The Sultan came especially to see  the boat, the pieces of which were put together that he might know its  shape and size. Yusuf then drew for him a ship with all sails set, on a  piece of paper. It was very well done; and excited the applause of my  visitors. I treated them, as usual, with pickles, marmalade, and tea.  Among other things I showed En-Noor the broad arrow, or government mark,  on many of our things; as the guns, and pistols, tent, bags, and  biscuits, which greatly surprised him.    The Sheikh was in good spirits, and was pleased with his visit. I sent  him during the day a piece of dark blue cotton print for a pillowcase.  This little present delighted him much. I am much hampered with the  \"princesses,\" who first sent to buy sugar, and then to beg, forgetting  to buy.    We have a Tuat Tuarick changing camels for slaves now in Tintalous. This  man belongs to the tribe called Sgomara, if I have caught the name  correctly.    _18th._--I rose early, having had a bad headache during the night  through eating meat in the middle of the day. Whatever is eaten in the  middle of the day must be taken very sparingly. I believe the greater  part of the diseases with which foreigners in these countries are  afflicted arise from want of sufficient attention to diet. We must take  great care of our health just as we are entering Soudan. The weather is  still cool, especially in the morning. The prevailing wind during these  last twenty days has been E.N.E., which is very refreshing. The Moorish  merchants pretend that in Soudan it is now very cold.    I received a visit from the young Shereef, whose conversation smacked a  good deal of a disagreeable curiosity respecting my movements and  intentions in Central Africa. I therefore gave him a very ordinary and  cool welcome. This fellow has been here some time, and never offered to  pay us a visit before. En-Noor has been feeding him during his stay. He  displayed a good deal of shrewdness, and is well acquainted with the  Christians of the Mediterranean. He is going to visit his brother in  Zinder, and then returns to Tripoli by the way of Bornou and Mourzuk.  Like all these shereefs, or marabouts, he pretended that had he been  with us, or had we travelled with him from Mourzuk to Tintalous, no one  would have dared to molest us; an assertion wholly false, for the  Tuaricks care little for marabouts when they are bent on plunder.    A young woman has just "]]]
