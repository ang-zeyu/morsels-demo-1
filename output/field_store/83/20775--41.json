Drake could always depend upon volunteers, and,  like all men of superb action, he had no liking for conscription. He  knew that in the performance and carrying out of great deeds (and  nearly all of his were terrific) it is men aflame with courage and  enthusiasm that carry the day, and take them as a whole, conscripts  are never wholehearted. The two great characteristics of the British  race--initiative and endurance--are due to this burning flame of  voluntarism.    The West India expedition was organized and all expenses guaranteed by  private individuals. The capital was L60,000, and its allocation was  L40,000 for expenses and L20,000 to be distributed amongst those who  had volunteered to serve. Both men and officers had signed on without  any stipulation for wages. They knew they were out for a piratical  cruise, and welcomed any danger, great or small, that would give them  a chance of making it not only a monetary success, but one that would  give Spanish autocracy another shattering blow. These ancient mariners  never trifled with life, and no sombre views or fatal shadows  disturbed their spirited ambition or caused them to shrink from their  strenuous and stupendous work. They went forth in their cockleshell  fleet as full of hope and confidence as those who are accustomed to  sail and man a transatlantic liner of the present day. Some of their  vessels were but little larger than a present-day battleship's tender.  Neither roaring forties nor Cape Horn hurricanes intimidated them. It  is only when we stop to think, that we realize how great these  adventurers were, and how much we owe to their sacred memories.    In addition to being ridiculously small and shabby in point of  efficiency in rigging, sails, and general outfit, it will always be a  mystery how it was that so few were lost by stress of weather or even  ordinary navigable risks. They were veritable boxes in design, and  their rig alone made it impossible for them to make rapid passages,  even if they had wished to do so. As I write these lines, and think of  my own Western Ocean experiences in well-designed, perfectly equipped,  large and small sailing vessels during the winter hurricane months,  when the passages were made literally under water and every liquid  mountain seemed to forebode immediate destruction, it taxes my  nautical knowledge to understand how these inferior and smaller craft  which Drake commanded did not succumb to the same elements that have  carried superior vessels in later years to their doom. One reason that  occurs to me is that they were never deeply laden, and they were  accustomed to ride hurricanes out when they had plenty of sea room at  their sea anchors.    But nothing can detract from what our generation may describe as their  eccentric genius in combining navigation with piracy and naval and  military art. Talk about \"human vision\"! What is the good of it if it  turns out nothing but unrestrained confusion? The men of the period I  am writing about had real \"vision,\" and applied it with accuracy  without disorganizing the machinery of life and making the world a  miserable place to live in. They were all for country and none for  self.    After the capture of the Spanish ship and the appropriation of her  cargo of fish, Drake's fleet went lounging along towards Vigo. In due  course he brought his ships to anchor in the harbour, and lost no time  in coming in contact with Don Pedro Bendero, the Spanish governor, who  was annoyed at the British Admiral's unceremonious appearance. Don  Pedro said that he was not aware that his country was at war with  Britain. Drake quickly disillusioned him, and demanded, \"If we are not  at war, why have English merchants been arrested?\" Don Pedro said an  order had come for their release. Drake landed forthwith a portion of  his force, and seeing that he meant business that foreboded trouble,  the governor sent him wine, fruit, and other luxurious articles of  food in abundance. The ships were anchored in a somewhat open  roadstead, so Drake resolved to take them farther up the waterway  where they would lie comfortably, no matter from what direction the  threatening storm might break. But he had another shrewd object in  view, which was to make a beginning in acquiring any of the valuable  and treasured possessions adorning the churches. A trusted officer who  was in his confidence, and a great admirer of his wisdom and other  personal qualities, was sent to survey the passage and to find a  suitable anchorage. He was a man of enterprise, with a strong dislike  to the Roman Catholic faith, and never doubted that he was perfectly  justified in relieving the churches of plate and other valuables.  These were, in his eyes, articles of idolatry that no man of puritanic  and Protestant principles could refrain from removing and placing  under the safe keeping of his revered chief, who was no more averse to  robbing a church than he was to robbing a ship carrying gold or fish.    As the vessel in charge of this intrepid officer, whose name was  Carlile, approached the town where it was proposed to anchor the fleet  the inhabitants fled, taking with them much of the church plate and  other things which the British had covetously thought an appropriate  prize of theirs. Carlile, being a man of resource, soon laid hold of  other church treasure, which amply compensated for the loss of that  which was carried off by the fleeing inhabitants at the mouth of the  harbour. The day following Christopher Carlile's satisfactory survey  the fleet was anchored off the town. The sight of it threw the whole  district into panic. A pompous governor of Galicia hastened to Vigo,  and on his arrival there he took fright at the number of ships and the  dreaded name of the pirate chief who was in command. It would be  futile to show fight, so he determined to accommodate himself to the  Admiral's terms, which were that he should have a free hand to  replenish the fleet with water and provisions, or any other odds and  ends, without interference. This being accomplished, he agreed to  sail, and no doubt the governor thought he had made a judicious  bargain in getting rid of him so easily. But Drake all the time had  the Spanish gold fleet in his mind. Sacrifices must be made in order  that it may be captured, so off he went for the Cape de Verde islands,  and found when he got there that the treasure-ships had arrived and  sailed only a few hours before. The disappointment was, according to  custom, taken with Christian composure. He had the aptitude of  switching his mind from one form of warfare to another. As I have  said, he would just as soon attack and plunder a city as a church or a  ship. Drake had missed the gold fleet, so he turned his attention to  the treasures of Santiago. When the governor and population were made  aware that the distinguished visitor to their island was the terrible  \"El Draque,\" they and their spiritual advisers as usual flew to the  mountains, without neglecting to take their money and priceless  possessions with them. Drake looted as much as was left in the city of  wine and other valuables, but he got neither gold nor silver, and  would probably have left Santiago unharmed but for the horrible murder  of one of his sailor-boys, whose body was found hacked to pieces. This  settled the doom of the finest built city in the Old World. \"El  Draque\" at once set fire to it and burnt it to ashes, with that  thoroughness which characterized all such dealings in an age when  barbaric acts justified more than equivalent reprisals.    It would have been a wiser course for the governor to have treated for  the ransom of the town than to have murdered a poor sailor lad who was  innocently having a stroll. It is balderdash to talk of the Spaniards  as being too proud to treat with a person whom they believed to be  nothing better than a pirate. The Spaniards, like other nationalities,  were never too proud to do anything that would strengthen or maintain  their supremacy. Their apparent pride in not treating with Drake at  Santiago and on other rare occasions was really the acme of terror at  hearing his name; there was neither high honour nor grandee dignity  connected with it. As to Philip's kingly pride, it consisted in  offering a special reward of L40,000 to have Elizabeth's great sailor  assassinated or kidnapped. There were many to whom the thought of the  bribe was fascinating. Numerous attempts were made, but whenever the  assassins came within sound of his name or sight of him or his ships  they became possessed of involuntary twitchy sensations, and fled in a  delirium of fear, which was attributed to his being a magician.    As soon as Drake had avenged the sailor-boy's murder he sailed for the  West Indies. When he got into the hot latitudes the plague of yellow  fever appeared, and nearly three hundred of his men died in a few  days. Arriving at Dominica, they found the Caribs had a deadly hatred  of the Spanish, and when they learned that the British were at war  with Spain they offered to prescribe a certain cure for yellow jack  which was eminently effectual. After disinfecting the ships, and  getting supplied with their requirements, the fleet left for San  Domingo, via St. Kitts, which was uninhabited at that time. Domingo  was one of the most beautiful and most wealthy islands in the world.  Columbus and his brother, Diego, are buried in the cathedral there.  The population believed themselves to be immune from harm or invasion  on this distant island home, but Drake soon disillusioned them. His  devoted lieutenant, Christopher Carlile, was selected as usual to find  a suitable channel and landing, a hazardous and almost unattainable  quest, but in his and Drake's skilful hands their object was  accomplished. The ships were brought into port, and in his usual  direct way Drake"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#6)"],[1,"are deemed unfit to be intrusted with so important a duty as  that of electing the persons who are to make and execute the laws of the  state. It is provided, however, that if such persons are pardoned before  the expiration of the term for which they were sentenced to be  imprisoned, their forfeited rights are restored.    Sec.8. By the earliest constitutions of many of the old states, electors  were required to own property, or to have paid rents or taxes, to a  certain amount. In the election of the higher officers, freeholders only  were entitled to vote. A _freeholder_ is an owner of real estate,  (property in lands,) which he holds in his own right, and may transmit  to his heirs. In the constitutions of the newer states, property has not  been made a qualification of an elector; and in the amended  constitutions of the old states this restriction upon the elective  franchise has been removed, until it has nearly ceased to exist in the  United States. It is now enjoyed by all white male freemen, with few  exceptions, in almost every state of the Union.          Chapter VII.    Elections.        Sec.1. For the convenient exercise of political power, as well as for the  purposes of government generally, the territory of a state is divided  into districts of small extent. It has been remarked, that the people of  a state, being too numerous to meet in one assembly to make laws and  transact the public business, elect a small number to represent them.  But to elect these representatives and other officers, and to adopt the  constitution, or fundamental law of the state, are political duties,  which must be performed by the people in person, and in a _collective_  capacity. Hence the necessity of small territorial divisions, in which  the people may assemble for political purposes.    Sec.2. A state is divided into counties, and these are divided into towns  or townships. The people of every county and every town have power to  manage their local concerns. The corporate powers of counties and towns,  and the election and the powers and duties of county and town officers,  will be given in subsequent chapters.    Sec.3. The electors of the state meet every year in their respective towns  for the election of officers. Meetings for electing town officers are,  in a majority of the states, held in the earlier part of the year. Most  officers elected by the people, other than town officers, are chosen at  the general state election, which, in most of the states, is held in  October or November.    Sec.4. Elections are conducted by persons designated by law, or chosen by  the electors of the town for that purpose. It is their duty to preserve  order, and to see that the business is properly done. They are usually  called _judges of elections_, or _inspectors of elections_. Persons  also, (usually two,) serve as clerks. Each clerk keeps a list of the  names of the persons voting, which is called a _poll-list. Poll_, which  is said to be a Saxon word, signifies _head_, and has come to mean  person. Thus, so much a head means so much for every _person_ By a  further change it has been made to signify an election, because the  persons there voting are numbered. Hence, \"going to the polls\" has  obtained the same meaning as going to an election.    Sec.5. When the inspectors are ready to receive votes, one of them makes it  known by proclaiming with a loud voice, that \"the polls are now open.\"  The inspectors receive from each voter a ballot, which is a piece of  paper containing the names of the persons voted for, and the title of  the office to which each of them is to be elected. _Ballot_, from the  French, means a little ball, and is used in voting. Ballots are of  different colors; those of one color signifying an affirmative vote, or  _yes_; those of another color a negative vote, or _no_. From this has  come the application of the word ballot to the written or printed ticket  now used in voting.    Sec.6. If no objection is made to an elector's voting, the ballot is put  into the box, and the clerks enter his name on the poll-list. If the  inspectors suspect that a person offering to vote is not a qualified  elector, they may question him upon his oath in respect to his  qualifications as to age, the term of his residence in the state and  county, and citizenship. Any bystander also may question his right to  vote. This is called _challenging_. A person thus challenged is not  allowed to vote until the challenge is withdrawn, or his qualifications  are either proved by the testimony of other persons, or sworn to by  himself.    Sec.7. In a few states, the voters are registered. A list is kept of the  names of all who have, upon examination, been ascertained to be  qualified electors; and those only whose names are on the register are  allowed to vote. Thus many interruptions to voting by the examination of  voters at the polls, and much illegal voting, are prevented. Voters in  some states are also required to take what is called the \"elector's  oath,\" in which they promise to be true and faithful to the state and  its government, and to the constitution of the United States; and to  give their votes as they shall judge will conduce to the best good of  the same.    Sec.8. After the polls are closed, the box is opened, and the ballots are  counted. If the number of ballots agrees with the number of names on the  poll-lists, it is presumed no mistake has been made, either in voting or  in keeping the lists. If the election is one for the choosing of town  officers, it is there determined who are elected, and their election is  publicly declared.    Sec.9. The election of county and state officers can not be determined by  the town canvassers. A statement of the votes given in each town for the  persons voted for, is sent to the county canvassers, who, from the  returns of votes from all the towns, determine and declare the election  of the officers chosen for the county. To determine the election of  state officers, and of such others as are elected for districts  comprising more than one county, a statement of the votes given for the  several candidates, is sent by the several boards of county canvassers  to the state canvassers, who, from the returns of votes from the several  counties, determine the election of the state officers.    Sec.10. In a few states, voting at elections is done _viva voce_. These  words mean by word of mouth. In voting in this manner, the elector  speaks the name of the person for whom he votes.    Sec.11. In most of the states, persons are elected by a plurality of votes.  An election by _plurality_ is when the person elected has received a  higher number of votes than any other, though such number be less than a  majority of all the votes given. Suppose, for example, three candidates  receive 1000 votes: One receives 450; another, 300; the third, 250  votes. The first, having the highest number, though not a majority, is  elected. In the New England, or eastern states, a _majority_, that is,  more than one-half of all the votes given, is necessary to the election  of many of the higher officers. The least number of votes out of 1000,  by which a person can be elected by this rule, is 501.    Sec.12. Either of these modes is liable to objection. When a simple  plurality effects an election, 1,000 votes may be so divided upon three  candidates as to elect one by 334 votes; or of four candidates, one may  be elected by 251 votes, and against the wishes of nearly three-fourths  of the electors. An objection to the other mode is, that if no person  receives a majority of all the votes, another election must be held.  Numerous trials have, in some instances, been necessary to effect a  choice; and the people of a district have remained for a time without a  representative in the state or national legislature.          Chapter VIII.    Division of the Powers of Government.        Sec.1. Having shown the nature of a constitution and the manner in which it  is made and adopted, it will next be shown how the powers of government  under a state constitution are divided. As the excellence of a form of  government consists much in a proper separation and distribution of  power, this subject deserves special attention.    Sec.2. We notice first the separation of the political and civil powers.  The words _political_ and _civil_ are often used as having the same  meaning. Thus, speaking of the system of government and laws of a  country, we use the general term, \"political institutions,\" or \"civil  institutions;\" either of which is deemed correct. But these words have  also a particular signification, as has already been shown in the  distinction made in preceding chapters between political rights and  civil rights, and between the political law and the municipal or civil  laws. (Chap. II, and III.) Hence it appears, that what we mean by  political power is the power exercised by the people in their political  capacity, in adopting their constitution and electing the officers of  the government; and that, by the civil power is meant the power  exercised by these officers in administering the government.    Sec.3. In an absolute government, no such distinction exists; all power is  centered in the supreme ruler. There is no political law binding on him.  Being himself restrained by no positive laws or regulations that have  been adopted by the people, or that may be altered by them, the people  have no political rights. In a mixed government, or limited monarchy,  political power is exercised to some extent. Although there is no  written constitution adopted by the people, as in a republic, the  members of one branch of the law-making power are elected by the people.  In such election they are said to exercise political power.    Sec.4. We notice next the division of the civil power. This power, in well  constructed governments, is divided into three departments, the  legislative, the executive,"]]]
