The former is known to have been in force about  A.D. 934, though it may have been introduced as early as 583. It did  not, however, become firmly established for more than a century. This  'extremely painful mutilation,' begun in infancy, illustrates the  tyranny of fashion, for it is supposed to have arisen in the imitation  by the women generally of the small feet of an imperial concubine  admired by one of the emperors from ten to fifteen centuries ago  (the books differ as to his identity). The second was a badge of  servitude inflicted by the Manchus on the Chinese when they conquered  China at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Discountenanced by  governmental edicts, both of these practices are now tending toward  extinction, though, of course, compressed feet and 'pigtails' are  still to be seen in every town and village. Legally, the queue was  abolished when the Chinese rid themselves of the Manchu yoke in 1912.      Funeral Rites    Not understanding the real nature of death, the Chinese believed  it was merely a state of suspended animation, in which the soul  had failed to return to the body, though it might yet do so,  even after long intervals. Consequently they delayed burial, and  fed the corpse, and went on to the house-tops and called aloud  to the spirit to return. When at length they were convinced that  the absent spirit could not be induced to re-enter the body, they  placed the latter in a coffin and buried it--providing it, however,  with all that it had found necessary in this life (food, clothing,  wives, servants, etc.), which it would require also in the next (in  their view rather a continuation of the present existence than the  beginning of another)--and, having inducted or persuaded the spirit  to enter the 'soul-tablet' which accompanied the funeral procession  (which took place the moment the tablet was 'dotted,' _i.e._ when  the character _wang_, 'prince,' was changed into _chu_, 'lord'),  carried it back home again, set it up in a shrine in the main hall,  and fell down and worshipped it. Thus was the spirit propitiated,  and as long as occasional offerings were not overlooked the power  for evil possessed by it would not be exerted against the surviving  inmates of the house, whom it had so thoughtlessly deserted.    The latter mourned by screaming, wailing, stamping their feet,  and beating their breasts, renouncing (in the earliest times) even  their clothes, dwelling, and belongings to the dead, removing to  mourning-sheds of clay, fasting, or eating only rice gruel, sleeping  on straw with a clod for a pillow, and speaking only on subjects of  death and burial. Office and public duties were resigned, and marriage,  music, and separation from the clan prohibited.    During the lapse of the long ages of monarchical rule funeral rites  became more elaborate and magnificent, but, though less rigid and  ceremonious since the institution of the Republic, they have retained  their essential character down to the present day.    Funeral ceremonial was more exacting than that connected with most  other observances, including those of marriage. Invitations or  notifications were sent to friends, and after receipt of these _fu_,  on the various days appointed therein, the guest was obliged to send  presents, such as money, paper horses, slaves, etc., and go and join  in the lamentations of the hired mourners and attend at the prayers  recited by the priests. Funeral etiquette could not be _pu'd, i.e._  made good, if overlooked or neglected at the right time, as it could  in the case of the marriage ceremonial.    Instead of symmetrical public graveyards, as in the West, the  Chinese cemeteries belong to the family or clan of the deceased,  and are generally beautiful and peaceful places planted with trees  and surrounded by artistic walls enclosing the grave-mounds and  monumental tablets. The cemeteries themselves are the metonyms of the  villages, and the graves of the houses. In the north especially the  grave is very often surmounted by a huge marble tortoise bearing the  inscribed tablet, or what we call the gravestone, on its back. The  tombs of the last two lines of emperors, the Ming and the Manchu,  are magnificent structures, spread over enormous areas, and always  artistically situated on hillsides facing natural or artificial lakes  or seas. Contrary to the practice in Egypt, with the two exceptions  above mentioned the conquering dynasties have always destroyed the  tombs of their predecessors. But for this savage vandalism, China  would probably possess the most magnificent assembly of imperial  tombs in the world's records.        Laws of Intercourse    Throughout the whole course of their existence as a social aggregate  the Chinese have pushed ceremonial observances to an extreme  limit. \"Ceremonies,\" says the _Li chi_, the great classic of ceremonial  usages, \"are the greatest of all things by which men live.\" Ranks were  distinguished by different headdresses, garments, badges, weapons,  writing-tablets, number of attendants, carriages, horses, height of  walls, etc. Daily as well as official life was regulated by minute  observances. There were written codes embracing almost every attitude  and act of inferiors toward superiors, of superiors toward inferiors,  and of equals toward equals. Visits, forms of address, and giving  of presents had each their set of formulae, known and observed by  every one as strictly and regularly as each child in China learned by  heart and repeated aloud the three-word sentences of the elementary  _Trimetrical Classic_. But while the school text-book was extremely  simple, ceremonial observances were extremely elaborate. A Chinese  was in this respect as much a slave to the living as in his funeral  rites he was a slave to the dead. Only now, in the rush of 'modern  progress,' is the doffing of the hat taking the place of the 'kowtow'  (_k'o-t'ou_).    It is in this matter of ceremonial observances that the East  and the West have misunderstood each other perhaps more than in  all others. Where rules of etiquette are not only different,  but are diametrically opposed, there is every opportunity for  misunderstanding, if not estrangement. The points at issue in  such questions as 'kowtowing' to the emperor and the worshipping  of ancestors are generally known, but the Westerner, as a rule, is  ignorant of the fact that if he wishes to conform to Chinese etiquette  when in China (instead of to those Western customs which are in many  cases unfortunately taking their place) he should not, for instance,  take off his hat when entering a house or a temple, should not shake  hands with his host, nor, if he wishes to express approval, should he  clap his hands. Clapping of hands in China (_i.e._ non-Europeanized  China) is used to drive away the _sha ch'i_, or deathly influence of  evil spirits, and to clap the hands at the close of the remarks of a  Chinese host (as I have seen prominent, well-meaning, but ill-guided  men of the West do) is equivalent to disapproval, if not insult. Had  our diplomatists been sociologists instead of only commercial agents,  more than one war might have been avoided.      Habits and Customs    At intervals during the year the Chinese make holiday. Their public  festivals begin with the celebration of the advent of the new  year. They let off innumerable firecrackers, and make much merriment  in their homes, drinking and feasting, and visiting their friends  for several days. Accounts are squared, houses cleaned, fresh paper  'door-gods' pasted on the front doors, strips of red paper with  characters implying happiness, wealth, good fortune, longevity, etc.,  stuck on the doorposts or the lintel, tables, etc., covered with red  cloth, and flowers and decorations displayed everywhere. Business  is suspended, and the merriment, dressing in new clothes, feasting,  visiting, offerings to gods and ancestors, and idling continue pretty  consistently during the first half of the first moon, the vacation  ending with the Feast of Lanterns, which occupies the last three  days. It originated in the Han dynasty 2000 years ago. Innumerable  lanterns of all sizes, shapes, colours (except wholly white, or rather  undyed material, the colour of mourning), and designs are lit in front  of public and private buildings, but the use of these was an addition  about 800 years later, _i.e._ about 1200 years ago. Paper dragons,  hundreds of yards long, are moved along the streets at a slow pace,  supported on the heads of men whose legs only are visible, giving  the impression of huge serpents winding through the thoroughfares.    Of the other chief festivals, about eight in number (not counting the  festivals of the four seasons with their equinoxes and solstices), four  are specially concerned with the propitiation of the spirits--namely,  the Earlier Spirit Festival (fifteenth day of second moon), the  Festival of the Tombs (about the third day of the third moon), when  graves are put in order and special offerings made to the dead, the  Middle Spirit Festival (fifteenth day of seventh moon), and the Later  Spirit Festival (fifteenth day of tenth moon). The Dragon-boat Festival  (fifth day of fifth moon) is said to have originated as a commemoration  of the death of the poet Ch'ue Yuean, who drowned himself in disgust  at the official intrigue and corruption of which he was the victim,  but the object is the procuring of sufficient rain to ensure a good  harvest. It is celebrated by racing with long narrow boats shaped to  represent dragons and propelled by scores of rowers, pasting of charms  on the doors of dwellings, and eating a special kind of rice-cake,  with a liquor as a beverage.    The fifteenth day of the eighth moon is the Mid-autumn Festival, known  by foreigners as All Souls' Day. On this occasion the women worship the  moon, offering "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#6)"],[1,"it was soon provided by the  other. Thus the Bhagavad-gita contains the ideas of the Mahayana in  substance, though in a different setting: it praises disinterested  activity and insists on faith. It is clear that at this period all  Indian thought and not merely Buddhism was vivified and transmuted by  two great currents of feeling demanding, the one a more emotional  morality the other more personal and more sympathetic deities.    I shall show in more detail below that most Mahayanist doctrines, though  apparently new, have their roots in old Indian ideas. But the presence  of foreign influences is not to be disputed and there is no difficulty  in accounting for them. Gandhara was a Persian province from 530 to 330  B.C. and in the succeeding centuries the north-western parts of India  experienced the invasions and settlements of numerous aliens, such as  Greeks from the Hellenistic kingdoms which arose after Alexander's  expedition, Parthians, Sakas and Kushans. Such immigrants, even if they  had no culture of their own, at least transported culture, just as the  Turks introduced Islam into Europe. Thus whatever ideas were prevalent  in Persia, in the Hellenistic kingdoms, or in Central Asia may also have  been prevalent in north-western India, where was situated the university  town of Taxila frequently mentioned in the Jatakas as a seat of Buddhist  learning. The foreigners who entered India adopted Indian religions[14]  and probably Buddhism more often than Hinduism, for it was at that time  predominant and disposed to evangelize without raising difficulties as  to caste.    Foreign influences stimulated mythology and imagery. In the reliefs of  Asoka's time, the image of the Buddha never appears, and, as in the  earliest Christian art, the intention of the sculptors is to illustrate  an edifying narrative rather than to provide an object of worship. But  in the Gandharan sculptures, which are a branch of Graeco-Roman art, he  is habitually represented by a figure modelled on the conventional type  of Apollo. The gods of India were not derived from Greece but they were  stereotyped under the influence of western art to this extent that  familiarity with such figures as Apollo and Pallas encouraged the Hindus  to represent their gods and heroes in human or quasi-human shapes. The  influence of Greece on Indian religion was not profound: it did not  affect the architecture or ritual of temples and still less thought or  doctrine. But when Indian religion and especially Buddhism passed into  the hands of men accustomed to Greek statuary, the inclination to  venerate definite personalities having definite shapes was  strengthened[15].    Persian influence was stronger than Greek. To it are probably due the  many radiant deities who shed their beneficent glory over the Mahayanist  pantheon, as well as the doctrine that Bodhisattvas are emanations of  Buddhas. The discoveries of Stein, Pelliot and others have shown that  this influence extended across Central Asia to China and one of the most  important turns in the fortunes of Buddhism was its association with a  Central Asian tribe analogous to the Turks and called Kushans or  Yueeh-chih, whose territories lay without as well as within the frontiers  of modern India and who borrowed much of their culture from Persia and  some from the Greeks. Their great king Kanishka is a figure in Buddhist  annals second only to Asoka. Unfortunately his date is still a matter of  discussion. The majority of scholars place his accession about 78 A.D.  but some put it rather later[16]. The evidence of numismatics and of art  indicates that he came towards the end of his dynasty rather than at the  beginning and the tradition which makes Asvaghosha his contemporary is  compatible with the later date.    Some writers describe Kanishka as the special patron of Mahayanism. But  the description is of doubtful accuracy. The style of religious art  known as Gandharan flourished in his reign and he convened a council  which fixed the canon of the Sarvastivadins. This school was reckoned as  Hinayanist and though Asvaghosha enjoys general fame in the Far East as  a Mahayanist doctor, yet his undoubted writings are not Mahayanist in  the strict sense of the word[17]. But a more ornate and mythological  form of religion was becoming prevalent and perhaps Kanishka's Council  arranged some compromise between the old and the new.    After Asvaghosha comes Nagarjuna who may have flourished any time  between 125 and 200 A.D. A legend which makes him live for 300 years is  not without significance, for he represents a movement and a school as  much as a personality and if he taught in the second century A.D. he  cannot have been the _founder_ of Mahayanism. Yet he seems to be the  first great name definitely connected with it and the ascription to him  of numerous later treatises, though unwarrantable, shows that his  authority was sufficient to stamp a work or a doctrine as orthodox  Mahayanism. His biographies connect him with the system of idealist or  nihilistic metaphysics expounded in the literature (for it is more than  a single work) called Prajnaparamita, with magical practices (by which  the power of summoning Bodhisattvas or deities is specially meant) and  with the worship of Amitabha. His teacher Saraha, a foreigner, is said  to have been the first who taught this worship in India. In this there  may be a kernel of truth but otherwise the extant accounts of Nagarjuna  are too legendary to permit of historical deductions. He was perhaps the  first eminent exponent of Mahayanist metaphysics, but the train of  thought was not new: it was the result of applying to the external world  the same destructive logic which Gotama applied to the soul and the  result had considerable analogies to Sankara's version of the Vedanta.  Whether in the second century A.D. the leaders of Buddhism already  identified themselves with the sorcery which demoralized late Indian  Mahayanism may be doubted, but tradition certainly ascribes to Nagarjuna  this corrupting mixture of metaphysics and magic.    The third century offers a strange blank in Indian history. Little can  be said except that the power of the Kushans decayed and that northern  India was probably invaded by Persians and Central Asian tribes. The  same trouble did not affect southern India and it may be that religion  and speculation flourished there and spread northwards, as certainly  happened in later times. Many of the greatest Hindu teachers were  Dravidians and at the present day it is in the Dravidian regions that  the temples are most splendid, the Brahmans strictest and most  respected. It may be that this Dravidian influence affected even  Buddhism in the third century A.D., for Aryadeva the successor of  Nagarjuna was a southerner and the legends told of him recall certain  Dravidian myths. Bodhidharma too came from the South and imported into  China a form of Buddhism which has left no record in India.      7. _Revival of Hinduism_    In 320 a native Indian dynasty, the Guptas, came to the throne and  inaugurated a revival of Hinduism, to which religion we must now turn.  To speak of the revival of Hinduism does not mean that in the previous  period it had been dead or torpid. Indeed we know that there was a Hindu  reaction against the Buddhism of Asoka about 150 B.C. But, on the whole,  from the time of Asoka onwards Buddhism had been the principal religion  of India, and before the Gupta era there are hardly any records of  donations made to Brahmans. Yet during these centuries they were not  despised or oppressed. They produced much literature[18]: their schools  of philosophy and ritual did not decay and they gradually made good  their claim to be the priests of India's gods, whoever those gods might  be. The difference between the old religion and the new lies in this.  The Brahmanas and Upanishads describe practices and doctrines of  considerable variety but still all the property of a privileged class in  a special region. They do not represent popular religion nor the  religion of India as a whole. But in the Gupta period Hinduism began to  do this. It is not a system like Islam or even Buddhism but a parliament  of religions, of which every Indian creed can become a member on  condition of observing some simple rules of the house, such as respect  for Brahmans and theoretical acceptance of the Veda. Nothing is  abolished: the ancient rites and texts preserve their mysterious power  and kings perform the horse-sacrifice. But side by side with this,  deities unknown to the Veda rise to the first rank and it is frankly  admitted that new revelations more suited to the age have been given to  mankind.    Art too enters on a new phase. In the early Indian sculptures deities  are mostly portrayed in human form, but in about the first century of  our era there is seen a tendency to depict them with many heads and  limbs and this tendency grows stronger until in mediaeval times it is  predominant. It has its origin in symbolism. The deity is thought of as  carrying many insignia, as performing more actions than two hands can  indicate; the worshipper is taught to think of him as appearing in this  shape and the artist does not hesitate to represent it in paint and  stone.    As we have seen, the change which came over Buddhism was partly due to  foreign influences and no doubt they affected most Indian creeds. But  the prodigious amplification of Hinduism was mainly due to the  absorption of beliefs prevalent in Indian districts other than the homes  of the ancient Brahmans. Thus south Indian religion is characterized  when we first know it by its emotional tone and it resulted in the  mediaeval Sivaism of the Tamil country. In another region, probably in  the west, grew up the monotheism of the Bhagavatas, which was the parent  of Vishnuism.    Hinduism may be said to fall into four principal divisions which are  really "]]]
