The Orang-Utan would rarely seem to exceed four feet in height, but  the body is very bulky, measuring two thirds of the height in  circumference.    The Orang-Utan is found only in Sumatra and Borneo, and is common in  either of these islands--in both of which it occurs always in low,  flat plains, never in the mountains. It loves the densest and most  sombre of the forests, which extend from the seashore inland, and thus  is found only in the eastern half of Sumatra, where alone such forests  occur, though, occasionally, it strays over to the western side.    On the other hand it is generally distributed through Borneo, except  in the mountains, or where the population is dense. In favorable  places the hunter may, by good fortune, see three or four in a day.    [Illustration: HEAD OF ORANG-UTAN.]    Except in the pairing time, the old males usually live by themselves.  The old females and the immature males, on the other hand, are often  met with in twos and threes; and the former occasionally have young  with them, though the pregnant females usually separate themselves,  and sometimes remain apart after they have given birth to their  offspring. The young Orangs seem to remain unusually long under their  mother's protection, probably in consequence of their slow growth.  While climbing the mother always carries her young against her bosom,  the young holding on by the mother's hair. At what time of life the  Orang-Utan becomes capable of propagation, and how long the females go  with young is unknown, but it is probable that they are not adult  until they arrive at ten or fifteen years of age. A female which lived  for five years at Batavia had not attained one-third the height of the  wild females. It is probable that, after reaching adult years, they go  on growing, though slowly, and that they live to forty or fifty years.  The Dyaks tell of old Orangs which have not only lost all their  teeth, but which find it so troublesome to climb that they maintain  themselves on windfalls and juicy herbage.    The Orang is sluggish, exhibiting none of that marvellous activity  characteristic of the Gibbons. Hunger alone seems to stir him to  exertion, and when it is stilled he relapses into repose. When the  animal sits, it curves its back and bows its head, so as to look  straight down on the ground; sometimes it holds on with its hands by a  higher branch, sometimes lets them hang phlegmatically down by its  side; and in these positions the Orang will remain for hours together,  in the same spot, almost without stirring, and only now and then  giving utterance to its deep, growling voice. By day he usually climbs  from one tree-top to another, and only at night descends to the  ground: and if then threatened with danger he seeks refuge among the  underwood. When not hunted, he remains a long time in the same  locality, and sometimes stops for many days on the same tree, a firm  place among its branches serving him for a bed. It is rare for the  Orang to pass the night in the summit of a large tree, probably  because it is too windy and cold there for him; but as soon as night  draws on he descends from the height and seeks out a fit bed in the  lower and darker part, or in the leafy top of a small tree, among  which he prefers Nibong palms, Pandani, or one of those parasitic  orchids which gave the primeval forests of Borneo so characteristic  and striking an appearance. But whenever he determines to sleep, there  he prepares himself a sort of nest; little boughs and leaves are drawn  together round the selected spot, and bent crosswise over one  another; while to make the bed soft, great leaves of ferns, of  orchids, of _Pandanus fascicularis_, _Nipa fruticans_, etc., are  laid over them. Those which Mueller saw, many of them being very fresh,  were situated at a height of ten to twenty-five feet above the ground,  and had a circumference, on the average, of two or three feet. Some  were packed many inches thick with _pandanus_ leaves; others were  remarkable only for the cracked twigs, which, united in a common  centre, formed a regular platform. \"The rude _hut_,\" says Sir James  Brooke, \"which they are stated to build in the trees, would be more  properly called a seat or nest, for it has no roof or cover of any  sort. The facility with which they form this nest is curious, and I  had an opportunity of seeing a wounded female weave the branches  together and seat herself within a minute.\"    According to the Dyaks the Orang rarely leaves his bed before the sun  is well above the horizon and has dissipated the mists. He gets up  about nine, and goes to bed again about five; but sometimes not till  late in the twilight. He lies sometimes on his back, or, by way of  change, turns on one side or the other, drawing his limbs up to his  body, and resting his head on his hand. When the night is cold, windy,  or rainy, he usually covers his body with a heap of _pandanus nipa_,  or fern leaves, like those of which his bed is made, and he is  especially careful to wrap up his head in them. It is this habit of  covering himself up which has probably led to the fable that the Orang  builds huts in the trees.    Although the Orang resides mostly amid the boughs of great trees  during the daytime, he is very rarely seen squatting on a thick branch  as other apes, and particularly the Gibbons, do. The Orang, on the  contrary, confines himself to the slender leafy branches, so that he  is seen right at the top of the trees, a mode of life which is closely  related to the constitution of his hinder limbs, and especially to  that of his seat. For this is provided with no callosites such as  are possessed by many of the lower apes, and even by the Gibbons; and  those bones of the pelvis, which are termed the ischia, and which form  the solid framework of the surface on which the body rests in the  sitting posture, are not expanded like those of the apes which possess  callosities, but are more like those of man.    An Orang climbs so slowly and cautiously as, in this act, to resemble  a man more than an ape, taking great care of his feet, so that injury  of them seems to affect him far more than it does other apes. Unlike  the Gibbons, whose forearms do the greater part of the work as they  swing from branch to branch, the Orang never makes even the smallest  jump. In climbing, he moves alternately one hand and one foot, or,  after having laid fast hold with the hands, he draws up both feet  together. In passing from one tree to another he always seeks out a  place where the twigs of both come close together, or interlace. Even  when closely pursued, his circumspection is amazing; he shakes the  branches to see if they will bear him, and then bending an overhanging  bough down by throwing his weight gradually along it, he makes a  bridge from the tree he wishes to quit to the next.    On the ground the Orang always goes laboriously and shakily on all  fours. At starting he will run faster than a man, though he may soon  be overtaken. The very long arms which, when he runs, are but little  bent, raise the body of the Orang remarkably, so that he assumes much  the posture of a very old man bent down by age, and making his way  along by the help of a stick. In walking, the body is usually directed  straight forward, unlike the other apes, which run more or less  obliquely, except the Gibbons, who in these, as in so many other  respects, depart remarkably from their fellows.    The Orang cannot put its feet flat on the ground, but is supported  upon their outer edges, the heel resting more on the ground, while the  curved toes partly rest upon the ground by the upper side of their  first joint, the two outermost toes of each foot completely resting on  this surface. The hands are held in the opposite manner, their inner  edges serving as the chief support. The fingers are then bent out in  such a manner that their foremost joints, especially those of the two  inner-most fingers, rest upon the ground by their upper sides, while  the point of the free and straight thumb serves as an additional  fulcrum.    The Orang never stands on its hind legs, and all the pictures  representing it as so doing are as false as the assertion that it  defends itself with sticks and the like.    The long arms are of especial use, not only in climbing, but in the  gathering of food from boughs to which the animal could not trust his  weight. Figs, blossoms, and young leaves of various kinds, constitute  the chief nutriment of the Orang; but strips of bamboo two or three  feet long were found in the stomach of a male. They are not known to  eat living animals.    Although, when taken young, the Orang-Utan soon becomes domesticated,  and indeed seems to court human society; it is naturally a very wild  and shy animal, though apparently sluggish and melancholy. The Dyaks  affirm that when the old males are wounded with arrows only they will  occasionally leave the trees and rush raging upon their enemies, whose  sole safety lies in instant flight, as they are sure to be killed if  caught.    But, though possessed of immense strength, it is rare for the Orang to  attempt to defend itself, especially when attacked with firearms. On  such occasions he endeavors to hide himself, or to escape along the  top-most branches of the trees, breaking off and throwing down the  boughs as he goes. When wounded he betakes himself to the highest  attainable point of the tree, and emits a singular cry, consisting at  first of high notes, which at length deepen into a low roar, not  unlike that of a panther. While giving out the high notes the Orang  thrusts out his lips into a funnel-shape; but in uttering the low  notes he holds his mouth wide open, and at the same time the great  throat bag, or laryngeal sac, becomes distended.    According to the Dyaks, the only animal the Orang measures his  strength with is the crocodile, who occasionally seizes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#6)"],[1,"hospitals, drinking saloons, and those  worse dens which are destroying the morals and the constitutions of so  many of the young of both sexes, will feel their influence to an extent  now little dreamed of. At all events women will not be taxed without an  opportunity to be heard, and will not be subject to fine and  imprisonment by laws made exclusively by men for doing what it is lawful  and honorable for men to do.    It may be said in answer to the argument in favor of female suffrage  derived from the cases to which I have referred, that men, not  individually, but collectively, are the natural and appropriate  representatives of women, and that, notwithstanding cases of individual  wrong, the rights of women are, on the whole, best protected by being  left to their care. It must be observed, however, that the cases which I  have stated, and which are only types of thousands like them, in their  cruelty and injustice, are the result of ages of legislation by these  assumed protectors of women. The wrongs were less in the men than in the  laws which sustained them, and which contained nothing for the  protection of the women.    But passing this view, let us look at the matter historically and on a  broader field.    If Chinese women were allowed an equal share with men in shaping the  laws of that great empire, would they subject their female children to  torture with bandaged feet, through the whole period of childhood and  growth, in order that they might be cripples for the residue of their  lives?    If Hindoo women could have shaped the laws of India, would widows for  ages have been burned on the funeral pyres of their deceased husbands?    If Jewish women had had a voice in framing Jewish laws, would the  husband, at his own pleasure, have been allowed to \"write his wife a  bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her out of his  house?\"    Would women in Turkey or Persia have made it a heinous, if not capital,  offence for a wife to be seen abroad with her face not covered by an  impenetrable veil?    Would women in England, however learned, have been for ages subjected to  execution for offences for which men, who could read, were only  subjected to burning in the hand and a few months imprisonment?    The principle which governs in these cases, or which has done so  hitherto, has been at all times and everywhere the same. Those who  succeed in obtaining power, no matter by what means, will, with rare  exceptions, use it for their exclusive benefit. Often, perhaps  generally, this is done in the honest belief that such use is for the  best good of all who are affected by it. A wrong, however, to those upon  whom it is inflicted, is none the less a wrong by reason of the good  motives of the party by whom it is inflicted.    The condition of subjection in which women have been held is the result  of this principle; the result of superior strength, not of superior  rights, on the part of men. Superior strength, combined with ignorance  and selfishness, but not with malice. It is a relic of the barbarism in  the shadow of which nations have grown up. Precisely as nations have  receded from barbarism the severity of that subjection has been relaxed.  So long as merely physical power governed in the affairs of the world,  the wrongs done to women were without the possibility of redress or  relief; but since nations have come to be governed by laws, there is  room to hope, though the process may still be a slow one, that injustice  in all its forms, or at least political injustice, may be extinguished.  No injustice can be greater than to deny to any class of citizens not  guilty of crime, all share in the political power of a state, that is,  all share in the choice of rulers, and in the making and administration  of the laws. Persons to which such share is denied, are essentially  slaves, because they hold their rights, if they can be said to have any,  subject to the will of those who hold the political power. For this  reason it has been found necessary to give the ballot to the emancipated  slaves. Until this was done their emancipation was far from complete.  Without a share in the political powers of the state, no class of  citizens has any security for its rights, and the history of nations to  which I briefly alluded, shows that women constitute no exception to the  universality of this rule.    Great errors, I think, exist in the minds of both the advocates and the  opponents of this measure in their anticipation of the immediate  effects to be produced by its adoption. On the one hand it is supposed  by some that the character of women would be radically changed--that  they would be unsexed, as it were, by clothing them with political  rights, and that instead of modest, amiable and graceful beings, we  should have bold, noisy and disgusting political demagogues, or  something worse, if anything worse can be imagined. I think those who  entertain such opinions are in error. The innate character of women is  the result of God's laws, not of man's, nor can the laws of man affect  that character beyond a very slight degree. Whatever rights may be given  to them, and whatever duties may be charged upon them by human laws,  their general character will remain unchanged. Their modesty, their  delicacy, and intuitive sense of propriety, will never desert them, into  whatever new positions their added rights or duties may carry them.    So far as women, without change of character as women, are qualified to  discharge the duties of citizenship, they will discharge them if called  upon to do so, and beyond that they will not go. Nature has put barriers  in the way of any excessive devotion of women to public affairs, and it  is not necessary that nature's work in that respect should be  supplemented by additional barriers invented by men. Such offices as  women are qualified to fill will be sought by those who do not find  other employment, and others they will not seek, or if they do, will  seek in vain. To aid in removing as far as possible the disheartening  difficulties which women dependent upon their own exertions encounter,  it is, I think, desirable that such official positions as they can fill  should be thrown open to them, and that they should be given the same  power that men have to aid each other by their votes. I would say,  remove all legal barriers that stand in the way of their finding  employment, official or unofficial, and leave them as men are left, to  depend for success upon their character and their abilities. As long as  men are allowed to act as milliners, with what propriety can they  exclude women from the post of school commissioners when chosen to such  positions by their neighbors? To deny them such rights, is to leave them  in a condition of political servitude as absolute as that of the African  slaves before their emancipation. This conclusion is readily to be  deduced from the opinion of Chief Justice Jay in the case of _Chisholm's  Ex'rs vs. The State of Georgia (2 Dallas, 419-471)_, although the  learned Chief Justice had of course no idea of any such application as I  make of his opinion.    The action was assumpsit by a citizen of the State of South Carolina,  and the question was, whether the United States Court had jurisdiction,  the State of Georgia declining to appear.    The Chief Justice, in the course of his opinion, after alluding to the  feudal idea of the character of the sovereign in England, and giving  some of the reasons why he was not subject to suit before the courts of  the kingdom, says:    \"The same feudal ideas run through all their jurisprudence, and  constantly remind us of the distinction between the prince and the  subject. No such ideas obtain here. At the revolution the sovereignty  devolved on the people; and they are truly the sovereigns of the  country, but _they are sovereigns without subjects_ (unless the African  slaves among us may be so called), and have none to govern but  themselves; the citizens of America _are equal as fellow-citizens, and  as joint tenants in the sovereignty_.\"    Now I beg leave to ask, in case this charge against Miss Anthony can be  sustained, what equality and what sovereignty is enjoyed by the half of  the citizens of these United States to which she belongs? Do they not,  in that event, occupy, _politically_, exactly the position which the  learned Chief Justice assigns to the African slaves? Are they not shown  to be _subjects_ of the other half, who are the sovereigns? And is not  their _political subjection_ as absolute as was that of the African  slaves? If that charge has any basis to rest upon, the learned Chief  Justice was wrong. The sovereigns of this country, according to the  theory of this prosecution, are not sovereigns without subjects. Though  two or three millions of their subjects have lately ceased to be such,  and have become freemen, they still hold twenty millions of subjects in  absolute _political_ bondage.    If it be said that my language is stronger than the facts warrant, I  appeal _to the record in this case_ for its justification.    As deductions from what has been said, I respectfully insist, 1st. That  upon the principles upon which our government is based, the privilege of  the elective franchise cannot justly be denied to women. 2d. That women  need it for their protection. 3d. That the welfare of both sexes will be  promoted by granting it to them.    Having occupied much more time than I intended in showing the justice  and propriety of the claim made by my client to the privileges of a  voter, I proceed to the consideration of the present state of the law on  that subject:    It would not become me, however clear my own convictions may be on the  subject, to assert the right of women, under our constitution and laws  as they now are, to vote at presidential and congressional elections, is  free from doubt, because very able men have expressed"]]]
