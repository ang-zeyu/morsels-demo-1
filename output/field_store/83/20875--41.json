[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#6)"],[1,", you are  yourself a pig, and you make my writings a sport of other swine. But  I still affirm that man is the measure of all things, although I admit  that one man may be a thousand times better than another, in proportion  as he has better impressions. Neither do I deny the existence of wisdom  or of the wise man. But I maintain that wisdom is a practical remedial  power of turning evil into good, the bitterness of disease into the  sweetness of health, and does not consist in any greater truth or  superior knowledge. For the impressions of the sick are as true as the  impressions of the healthy; and the sick are as wise as the healthy. Nor  can any man be cured of a false opinion, for there is no such thing;  but he may be cured of the evil habit which generates in him an evil  opinion. This is effected in the body by the drugs of the physician, and  in the soul by the words of the Sophist; and the new state or opinion  is not truer, but only better than the old. And philosophers are not  tadpoles, but physicians and husbandmen, who till the soil and infuse  health into animals and plants, and make the good take the place of the  evil, both in individuals and states. Wise and good rhetoricians make  the good to appear just in states (for that is just which appears just  to a state), and in return, they deserve to be well paid. And you,  Socrates, whether you please or not, must continue to be a measure.  This is my defence, and I must request you to meet me fairly. We are  professing to reason, and not merely to dispute; and there is a great  difference between reasoning and disputation. For the disputer is always  seeking to trip up his opponent; and this is a mode of argument which  disgusts men with philosophy as they grow older. But the reasoner is  trying to understand him and to point out his errors to him, whether  arising from his own or from his companion's fault; he does not argue  from the customary use of names, which the vulgar pervert in all manner  of ways. If you are gentle to an adversary he will follow and love you;  and if defeated he will lay the blame on himself, and seek to escape  from his own prejudices into philosophy. I would recommend you,  Socrates, to adopt this humaner method, and to avoid captious and verbal  criticisms.'    Such, Theodorus, is the very slight help which I am able to afford to  your friend; had he been alive, he would have helped himself in far  better style.    'You have made a most valorous defence.'    Yes; but did you observe that Protagoras bade me be serious, and  complained of our getting up a laugh against him with the aid of a boy?  He meant to intimate that you must take the place of Theaetetus, who may  be wiser than many bearded men, but not wiser than you, Theodorus.    'The rule of the Spartan Palaestra is, Strip or depart; but you are like  the giant Antaeus, and will not let me depart unless I try a fall with  you.'    Yes, that is the nature of my complaint. And many a Hercules, many a  Theseus mighty in deeds and words has broken my head; but I am always at  this rough game. Please, then, to favour me.    'On the condition of not exceeding a single fall, I consent.'    Socrates now resumes the argument. As he is very desirous of doing  justice to Protagoras, he insists on citing his own words,--'What  appears to each man is to him.' And how, asks Socrates, are these words  reconcileable with the fact that all mankind are agreed in thinking  themselves wiser than others in some respects, and inferior to them in  others? In the hour of danger they are ready to fall down and worship  any one who is their superior in wisdom as if he were a god. And the  world is full of men who are asking to be taught and willing to be  ruled, and of other men who are willing to rule and teach them. All  which implies that men do judge of one another's impressions, and think  some wise and others foolish. How will Protagoras answer this argument?  For he cannot say that no one deems another ignorant or mistaken. If you  form a judgment, thousands and tens of thousands are ready to maintain  the opposite. The multitude may not and do not agree in Protagoras'  own thesis that 'Man is the measure of all things;' and then who is to  decide? Upon his own showing must not his 'truth' depend on the number  of suffrages, and be more or less true in proportion as he has more or  fewer of them? And he must acknowledge further, that they speak truly  who deny him to speak truly, which is a famous jest. And if he admits  that they speak truly who deny him to speak truly, he must admit that  he himself does not speak truly. But his opponents will refuse to admit  this of themselves, and he must allow that they are right in their  refusal. The conclusion is, that all mankind, including Protagoras  himself, will deny that he speaks truly; and his truth will be true  neither to himself nor to anybody else.    Theodorus is inclined to think that this is going too far. Socrates  ironically replies, that he is not going beyond the truth. But if the  old Protagoras could only pop his head out of the world below, he would  doubtless give them both a sound castigation and be off to the shades  in an instant. Seeing that he is not within call, we must examine the  question for ourselves. It is clear that there are great differences in  the understandings of men. Admitting, with Protagoras, that immediate  sensations of hot, cold, and the like, are to each one such as they  appear, yet this hypothesis cannot be extended to judgments or opinions.  And even if we were to admit further,--and this is the view of some who  are not thorough-going followers of Protagoras,--that right and wrong,  holy and unholy, are to each state or individual such as they appear,  still Protagoras will not venture to maintain that every man is equally  the measure of expediency, or that the thing which seems is expedient  to every one. But this begins a new question. 'Well, Socrates, we have  plenty of leisure. Yes, we have, and, after the manner of philosophers,  we are digressing; I have often observed how ridiculous this habit of  theirs makes them when they appear in court. 'What do you mean?' I mean  to say that a philosopher is a gentleman, but a lawyer is a servant.  The one can have his talk out, and wander at will from one subject  to another, as the fancy takes him; like ourselves, he may be long or  short, as he pleases. But the lawyer is always in a hurry; there is the  clepsydra limiting his time, and the brief limiting his topics, and his  adversary is standing over him and exacting his rights. He is a servant  disputing about a fellow-servant before his master, who holds the cause  in his hands; the path never diverges, and often the race is for his  life. Such experiences render him keen and shrewd; he learns the arts of  flattery, and is perfect in the practice of crooked ways; dangers have  come upon him too soon, when the tenderness of youth was unable to meet  them with truth and honesty, and he has resorted to counter-acts of  dishonesty and falsehood, and become warped and distorted; without any  health or freedom or sincerity in him he has grown up to manhood, and is  or esteems himself to be a master of cunning. Such are the lawyers; will  you have the companion picture of philosophers? or will this be too much  of a digression?    'Nay, Socrates, the argument is our servant, and not our master. Who is  the judge or where is the spectator, having a right to control us?'    I will describe the leaders, then: for the inferior sort are not worth  the trouble. The lords of philosophy have not learned the way to the  dicastery or ecclesia; they neither see nor hear the laws and votes of  the state, written or recited; societies, whether political or festive,  clubs, and singing maidens do not enter even into their dreams. And the  scandals of persons or their ancestors, male and female, they know no  more than they can tell the number of pints in the ocean. Neither  are they conscious of their own ignorance; for they do not practise  singularity in order to gain reputation, but the truth is, that the  outer form of them only is residing in the city; the inner man, as  Pindar says, is going on a voyage of discovery, measuring as with line  and rule the things which are under and in the earth, interrogating the  whole of nature, only not condescending to notice what is near them.    'What do you mean, Socrates?'    I will illustrate my meaning by the jest of the witty maid-servant, who  saw Thales tumbling into a well, and said of him, that he was so eager  to know what was going on in heaven, that he could not see what was  before his feet. This is applicable to all philosophers. The philosopher  is unacquainted with the world; he hardly knows whether his neighbour is  a man or an animal. For he is always searching into the essence of man,  and enquiring what such a nature ought to do or suffer different from  any other. Hence, on every occasion in private life and public, as I was  saying, when he appears in a law-court or anywhere, he is the joke, not  only of maid-servants, but of the general herd, falling into wells  and every sort of disaster; he looks such an awkward, inexperienced  creature, unable to say anything personal, when he is abused, in answer  to his adversaries (for he knows no evil of any one); and when he hears  the praises of others, he cannot help laughing from the bottom of  his soul at their pretensions; and this also gives him a ridiculous  appearance. A king or tyrant appears to him to be a kind of swine-herd  or cow-herd, milking away at an animal who is much more troublesome and  dangerous than cows or sheep; like the cow-herd, he has no time to be  educated, and the pen in which he keeps his flock in the mountains is  surrounded by a wall. When he hears of large landed properties of ten  thousand acres or more, he thinks of the whole earth; or if he is  told"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17262"],[0,"Catalogue Of Linguistic Manuscripts In The Library Of The Bureau Of Ethnology.
