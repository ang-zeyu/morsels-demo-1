There is not much  probability of this frequently happening, because, as I said in my  other letter, Salmon seldom migrate except where there are freshes  in the rivers, and then there is so much water flowing down the  usual course of the stream, that the fish have no inducement to  leave it to seek for a passage elsewhere. I would, however,  suggest that power be given to conservators to go at all times up  the tail-goits and into the wheelhouses, to see that there are no  illegal contrivances in them for catching the Salmon and Smolts in  their migration, as I have certainly heard of such things  occurring.    In Sir Thomas Winnington's note to my friend, he says we have  difficulty enough in endeavouring to obtain support for one day's  clear course; two we could not carry, however desirable. Allow me  to suggest, that in endeavouring to carry so little you rouse up  your opponents, while there is not enough to stimulate the zeal of  your friends, for it will be in vain to look for the zealous co-  operation of the proprietors on the upper part of rivers unless  you give them some inducement. This one day in the week will not  effect, and besides this, you make it illegal to catch Smolts,  even with the rod, which is destroying one of the greatest  amusements of the anglers, and depriving them of the most delicate  of fish, and for no object: because, if the provisions of your  bill are carried (without this clause), there will be an abundant  supply of fish for all purposes, even after the anglers have  enjoyed their sport. I do not see the propriety and utility of  prohibiting the killing of Smolts, because if they lived they  would become Salmon, any more than I see the propriety of  prohibiting the eating of eggs, because if they were hatched and  lived long enough they would become barn-door fowls.    Let the legislature and the estuary fisheries give the upper  proprietors a fair share of Salmon when in season, and they will  be glad to see the angling for Smolts abolished; but it is rather  too bad for the estuary fisheries to catch all the good Salmon,  and then grudge to the upper proprietors the angling for Smolts.    In conclusion, allow me to urge on you the propriety of  endeavouring to obtain such a bill as will give the proprietors of  land on the upper parts of rivers a strong inducement to support  you, and at the same time that it does this will not injure the  mill-owners; and, with the modifications I have pointed out, I  think this may be accomplished. I speak on this subject as a  practical man, having some knowledge of the habits of Salmon, and  superintending a mill driven by water-power which employs nearly a  thousand people; so that if a bill like yours could be worked in a  satisfactory manner here, on so small a stream as the Ribble, it  may anywhere in the kingdom. But if you make a tinkering job of  it, and ask for too little, you will rouse your opponents and  discourage your friends. By all means go for a free passage for  the fish every night from sunset to sunrise in all cases where  this does not interfere with manufactories, and then there will be  some inducement to support you.    I refer you to some papers which I wrote on this subject in the  Magazine of Natural History, in the year 1834, and if you think it  worth while to ask for further information on the subject, I shall  be happy to give you any I may possess.    * * * * *    LOW MOOR, _July 1st_, 1846.    To the Editor of \"The Times.\"    The attempt which is now making to amend the laws relating to the  Salmon fisheries, appears to run such a great risk of failure,  from the opposition of interested persons, that I think a short  sketch of the defects of the present laws and their effects on the  breed of fish, and a comparison of them with the proposed  amendment, may be interesting to some of your readers, and may,  perhaps, induce some influential gentlemen to throw their  influence into the right scale, in the approaching discussion on  this subject.    The Salmon fisheries in former times appear to have supplied food  for a large portion of the people, as there are still traditions  current on the banks of various rivers in the north, that the  indentures of apprenticeship always stipulated that the apprentice  should not be compelled to eat Salmon more frequently than three  days a week, and however exaggerated this story may appear at the  present day, I hope to succeed in showing that it is neither  improbable that it has been so, nor impossible that it may be so  again,--if good laws are made for their protection, and these laws  are properly enforced. At present there is no doubt the fisheries  are rapidly declining, and in some rivers which used to have a  good many Salmon in them, and which used to swarm with Smolts (or  fry) in the spring within my remembrance, they are now rarely  seen. To show their scarcity I may mention a circumstance which  occurred in the Wharfe, which was formerly one of the finest  rivers in Yorkshire for Salmon. A few years ago a pair of Salmon  were seen on a spawning bed in the Wharfe, about forty miles from  its mouth. This became known at the anglers' club, and it was  deemed so important to preserve them, that the club divided  themselves into three or four watches, and guarded the spawning  bed night and day, whilst the fish were spawning, and this  spawning lasted about a week.    Here in the Ribble the Salmon fisheries are not quite so near  extinction (though they are rapidly progressing in that  direction), for although we are very seldom allowed to see or  catch fish in seasonable condition, a good many come up the river  to spawn, though very few of them ever do so, and very few of  those that do ever reach the sea again. The reason is obvious, no  one here has any interest in preserving the spawning fish, and  they are openly killed by the poachers, who never dream of being  prosecuted for it. I am credibly informed that in a stream not  five hundred yards from where I write, sixty spawning fish were  killed last winter. Some years ago one gang of poachers killed  three hundred Salmon on the spawning beds in one season, and sold  potted Salmon roe (which is a most destructive bait for Trout) to  the value of L20.    In the Lune the proprietors of the fisheries near Lancaster sent  men to protect the spawning fish in the streams above; but these  men were warned off by the landed proprietors, who said, If you  catch all the good fish you must at least allow us to catch the  bad ones. In the Tweed and its tributaries it used to be quite as  bad (what the new Scotch law has done I do not know), but a  poacher who gave evidence before the Committee of the House of  Commons in 1825 said that he had assisted to take four hundred  Salmon at one haul in close time in the Tweed.    Sir Walter Scott's vivid description of burning the water, which  occurs in \"Guy Mannering,\" shows that he knew how to kill Salmon  in close time. In fact, his account, and that of Hogg (the Ettrick  Shepherd), show that both were regular black fishers.    There are various devices for killing the fish in close time: they  are speared, netted, and hooked on the spawning beds, and when the  rivers get low, gangs of idle fellows range up and down on the  banks, stoning and beating the water by poles, or, what is more  effective still, a large bone, or horse's skull, and by fastening  a cord to it, one end of which is passed to each side of the  river, they draw this skull up and down in the pools where they  know there are Salmon, and the fish are so foolish and timid, that  they thrust their heads under any stone or cover they can find,  and are taken without trouble; it being common enough in such  cases to slip a noose over the tail, then tightening it, and the  fish is hauled out immediately.    Then again, gentlemen who want to have the reputation of being  skilful anglers, employ their game-keepers to find the Kippers  (Scottice Kelts) or spawned fish in the pools, which is a very  easy matter in low water, and dropping a hook baited with a lob  worm before their noses, it is greedily taken, and the poor fish  (which are unfit for food) are caught. It is then trumpeted forth  to the angling world that Mr. A. B. has had splendid sport--he has  caught a dozen Salmon with the rod in a single day, meaning it to  be understood that these fish have been caught with the fly. I by  no means uphold these practices, neither do I think them very  deserving of censure in the present state of the law, for all the  good fish are taken near the mouths of the rivers.    This leads me to consider the defects of the present law, which is  by no means adapted to protect and increase the breed of Salmon.    In the first place, the close time is too short. It commences in  the Ribble nominally (for in reality the fish are openly killed  all the year through) on the 15th September, and ends on the 31st  of December; whereas it ought to extend to the end of April, for  the following reasons. A very large proportion of the fish are  spawning in January and February, and I have even seen a spawning  fish as late as the 3rd of April. In the evidence given before the  House of Commons in 1825, it was proved by a fisherman from the  Tweed, that in March for one clean fish that was caught there were  ten caught that were not so, as they were either fish that had not  spawned, or Kelts, that is, fish which have finished spawning but  have not returned to the sea, and are then flabby, unwholesome,  and unfit for food. A very large proportion of these Kippers or  Kelts do not go to the sea until April, and not then without there  is a fresh in the river, for, like the Smolts, they seem disposed  to remain in the rivers until they can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#6)"],[1,"here condensed he said in a quiet manner, with his  grave dark regards divided between me and the fire.  He threw in  the word, \"Sir,\" from time to time, and especially when he referred  to his youth,--as though to request me to understand that he  claimed to be nothing but what I found him.  He was several times  interrupted by the little bell, and had to read off messages, and  send replies.  Once he had to stand without the door, and display a  flag as a train passed, and make some verbal communication to the  driver.  In the discharge of his duties, I observed him to be  remarkably exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a  syllable, and remaining silent until what he had to do was done.    In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the safest of  men to be employed in that capacity, but for the circumstance that  while he was speaking to me he twice broke off with a fallen color,  turned his face towards the little bell when it did NOT ring,  opened the door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the  unhealthy damp), and looked out towards the red light near the  mouth of the tunnel.  On both of those occasions, he came back to  the fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had remarked,  without being able to define, when we were so far asunder.    Said I, when I rose to leave him, \"You almost make me think that I  have met with a contented man.\"    (I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead him on.)    \"I believe I used to be so,\" he rejoined, in the low voice in which  he had first spoken; \"but I am troubled, sir, I am troubled.\"    He would have recalled the words if he could.  He had said them,  however, and I took them up quickly.    \"With what?  What is your trouble?\"    \"It is very difficult to impart, sir.  It is very, very difficult  to speak of.  If ever you make me another visit, I will try to tell  you.\"    \"But I expressly intend to make you another visit.  Say, when shall  it be?\"    \"I go off early in the morning, and I shall be on again at ten to-  morrow night, sir.\"    \"I will come at eleven.\"    He thanked me, and went out at the door with me.  \"I'll show my  white light, sir,\" he said, in his peculiar low voice, \"till you  have found the way up.  When you have found it, don't call out!  And when you are at the top, don't call out!\"    His manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me, but I said  no more than, \"Very well.\"    \"And when you come down to-morrow night, don't call out!  Let me  ask you a parting question.  What made you cry, 'Halloa!  Below  there!' to-night?\"    \"Heaven knows,\" said I.  \"I cried something to that effect--\"    \"Not to that effect, sir.  Those were the very words.  I know them  well.\"    \"Admit those were the very words.  I said them, no doubt, because I  saw you below.\"    \"For no other reason?\"    \"What other reason could I possibly have?\"    \"You had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in any  supernatural way?\"    \"No.\"    He wished me good-night, and held up his light.  I walked by the  side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable sensation  of a train coming behind me) until I found the path.  It was easier  to mount than to descend, and I got back to my inn without any  adventure.    Punctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the first notch of  the zigzag next night, as the distant clocks were striking eleven.  He was waiting for me at the bottom, with his white light on.  \"I  have not called out,\" I said, when we came close together; \"may I  speak now?\"  \"By all means, sir.\"  \"Good-night, then, and here's my  hand.\"  \"Good-night, sir, and here's mine.\"  With that we walked  side by side to his box, entered it, closed the door, and sat down  by the fire.    \"I have made up my mind, sir,\" he began, bending forward as soon as  we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a little above a  whisper, \"that you shall not have to ask me twice what troubles me.  I took you for some one else yesterday evening.  That troubles me.\"    \"That mistake?\"    \"No.  That some one else.\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Like me?\"    \"I don't know.  I never saw the face.  The left arm is across the  face, and the right arm is waved,--violently waved.  This way.\"    I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of an arm  gesticulating, with the utmost passion and vehemence, \"For God's  sake, clear the way!\"    \"One moonlight night,\" said the man, \"I was sitting here, when I  heard a voice cry, 'Halloa!  Below there!'  I started up, looked  from that door, and saw this Someone else standing by the red light  near the tunnel, waving as I just now showed you.  The voice seemed  hoarse with shouting, and it cried, 'Look out!  Look out!'  And  then attain, 'Halloa!  Below there!  Look out!'  I caught up my  lamp, turned it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling,  'What's wrong?  What has happened?  Where?'  It stood just outside  the blackness of the tunnel.  I advanced so close upon it that I  wondered at its keeping the sleeve across its eyes.  I ran right up  at it, and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when  it was gone.\"    \"Into the tunnel?\" said I.    \"No.  I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred yards.  I stopped, and  held my lamp above my head, and saw the figures of the measured  distance, and saw the wet stains stealing down the walls and  trickling through the arch.  I ran out again faster than I had run  in (for I had a mortal abhorrence of the place upon me), and I  looked all round the red light with my own red light, and I went up  the iron ladder to the gallery atop of it, and I came down again,  and ran back here.  I telegraphed both ways, 'An alarm has been  given.  Is anything wrong?'  The answer came back, both ways, 'All  well.'\"    Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my spine, I  showed him how that this figure must be a deception of his sense of  sight; and how that figures, originating in disease of the delicate  nerves that minister to the functions of the eye, were known to  have often troubled patients, some of whom had become conscious of  the nature of their affliction, and had even proved it by  experiments upon themselves.  \"As to an imaginary cry,\" said I, \"do  but listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while  we speak so low, and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph  wires.\"    That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat listening for  a while, and he ought to know something of the wind and the wires,--  he who so often passed long winter nights there, alone and  watching. But he would beg to remark that he had not finished.    I asked his pardon, and he slowly added these words, touching my  arm--    \"Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable accident on  this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and wounded were  brought along through the tunnel over the spot where the figure had  stood.\"    A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best against it.  It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this was a remarkable  coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his mind.  But it was  unquestionable that remarkable coincidences did continually occur,  and they must be taken into account in dealing with such a subject.  Though to be sure I must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that  he was going to bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common  sense did not allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary  calculations of life.    He again begged to remark that he had not finished.    I again begged his pardon for being betrayed into interruptions.    \"This,\" he said, again laying his hand upon my arm, and glancing  over his shoulder with hollow eyes, \"was just a year ago.  Six or  seven months passed, and I had recovered from the surprise and  shock, when one morning, as the day was breaking, I, standing at  the door, looked towards the red light, and saw the spectre again.\"  He stopped, with a fixed look at me.    \"Did it cry out?\"    \"No.  It was silent.\"    \"Did it wave its arm?\"    \"No.  It leaned against the shaft of the light, with both hands  before the face.  Like this.\"    Once more I followed his action with my eyes.  It was an action of  mourning.  I have seen such an attitude in stone figures on tombs.    \"Did you go up to it?\"    \"I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts, partly  because it had turned me faint.  When I went to the door again,  daylight was above me, and the ghost was gone.\"    \"But nothing followed?  Nothing came of this?\"    He touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice giving  a ghastly nod each time:-    \"That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I noticed, at a  carriage window on my side, what looked like a confusion of hands  and heads, and something waved.  I saw it just in time to signal  the driver, Stop!  He shut off, and put his brake on, but the train  drifted past here a hundred and fifty yards or more.  I ran after  it, and, as I went along, heard terrible screams and cries.  A  beautiful young lady had died instantaneously in one of the  compartments, and was brought in here, and laid down on this floor  between us.\"    Involuntarily I pushed my chair back, as I looked from the boards  at which he pointed to himself.    \"True, sir.  True.  Precisely as it happened, so I tell it you.\"    I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth was  very dry.  The wind and the wires took up the story with a long  lamenting wail.    He resumed.  \"Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my mind is  troubled.  The spectre came back a week ago.  Ever since, it has  been there, now and again, by fits and starts.\"    \"At the light?\"    \"At the Danger-light.\"    \"What does it seem to do?\"    He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence, that  former gesticulation of, \"For God's sake, clear the way!\"    Then he went on.  \"I have no peace or rest for it.
