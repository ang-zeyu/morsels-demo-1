(#6)"],[1,"the letter of the late sovereign,  who conjured them to support his interest as faithful subjects, and  eternize their names by a loyalty suitable to their former professions.  He said he would not fail to give them such a speedy and powerful  assistance as would enable them to defend themselves from any foreign  attempt; and even to assert his right against those enemies who had  depressed it by the blackest usurpations and unnatural attempts, which  the Almighty God would not allow to pass unpunished. He offered pardon  to all those who should return to their duty before the last day of the  month; and threatened to punish rigorously such as should stand out in  rebellion against him and his authority.          THE CONVENTION RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF KING WILLIAM.    This address produced very little effect in favour of the unfortunate  exile, whose friends were greatly outnumbered in this assembly. His  messenger was ordered into custody, and afterwards dismissed with a  pass instead of an answer. James, foreseeing this contempt, had, by an  instrument dated in Ireland, authorised the archbishop of Glasgow, the  earl of Balcarras, and the viscount Dundee, to call a convention of the  estates at Stirling. These three depended on the interest of the marquis  of Athol and the earl of Mar, who professed the warmest affection  for the late king; and they hoped a secession of their friends would  embarrass the convention, so as to retard the settlement of king  William. Their expectations, however, were disappointed. Athol deserted  their cause; and Mar suffered himself to be intercepted in his retreat.  The rest of their party were, by the vigilance of the duke of Hamilton,  prevented from leaving the convention, except the viscount Dundee, who  retreated to the mountains with about fifty horse, and was pursued  by order of the estates. This design being frustrated, the convention  approved and recognized, by a solemn act, the conduct of the nobility  and gentlemen who had entreated the king of England to take upon him  the administration. They acknowledged their obligation to the prince of  Orange, who had prevented the destruction of their laws, religion, and  fundamental constitution; they besought his highness to assume the reins  of government for that kingdom; they issued a proclamation requiring  all persons, from sixteen to sixty, to be in readiness to take arms  when called upon for that purpose; they conferred the command of their  horse-militia upon sir Patrick Hume, who was formerly attainted for  having been concerned in Argyle's insurrection; they levied eight  hundred men for a guard to the city of Edinburgh, and constituted the  earl of Leven their commander; they put the militia all over the kingdom  into the hands of those on whom they could rely; they created the earl  of Mar governor of Stirling-castle; they received a reinforcement of  five regiments from England under the command of Mac-kay, whom they  appointed their general; and they issued orders for securing all  disaffected persons. Then they dispatched lord Ross with an answer to  king William's letter, professing their gratitude to their deliverer,  and congratulating him upon his success. They thanked him for assuming  the administration of their affairs, and assembling a convention of  their estates.    They declared they would take effectual and speedy measures for securing  the protestant religion, as well as for establishing the government,  laws, and liberties of the kingdom. They assured him they would, as much  as lay in their power, avoid disputes and animosities; and desired the  continuance of his majesty's care and protection.          CROWN VOTED VACANT, AND AN ACT OF SETTLEMENT PASSED.    After the departure of lord Ross, they appointed a committee, consisting  of eight lords, eight knights, and as many burgesses, to prepare the  plan of a new settlement: but this resolution was not taken without  a vigorous opposition from some remaining adherents of the late king,  headed by the archbishop of Glasgow; all the other prelates, except  he of Edinburgh, having already deserted the convention. After warm  debates, the committee agreed in the following vote:--\"The estates of  the kingdom of Scotland find and declare, That king James VII. being a  profest papist, did assume the royal power, and act as a king, without  ever taking the oath required by law; and had, by the advice of evil  and wicked counsellors, invaded the fundamental constitution of  this kingdom, and altered it from a legal and limited monarchy to an  arbitrary despotic power, and had governed the same to the subversion of  the protestant religion, and violation of the laws and liberties of the  nation, inverting all the ends of government; whereby he had forfaulted  the right of the crown, and the throne was become vacant.\" When this  vote was reported, the bishop of Edinburgh argued strenuously against  it, as containing a charge of which the king was innocent; and he  proposed that his majesty should be invited to return to his Scottish  dominions. All his arguments were defeated or overruled, and the house  confirmed the vote, which was immediately enacted into a law by a great  majority. The lord president declared the throne vacant, and proposed  that it might be filled with William and Mary, king and queen of  England. The committee was ordered to prepare an act for settling the  crown upon their majesties, together with an instrument of government  for securing the subjects from the grievances under which they  laboured.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          THE CROWN TENDERED TO WILLIAM.    On the eleventh day of April, this act, with the conditions of  inheritance, and the instrument, were reported, considered, unanimously  approved, and solemnly proclaimed at the market-cross of Edinburgh,  in presence of the lord president, assisted by the lord provost and  magistracy of the city, the duke of Queensbury, the marquisses of Athol  and Douglas, together with a great number of the nobility and gentry.  At the same time they published another proclamation, forbidding all  persons to acknowledge, obey, assist, or correspond with the late king  James; or by word, writing, or sermon, to dispute or disown the  royal authority of king William and queen Mary; or to misconstrue the  proceedings of the estates, or create jealousies or misapprehensions  with regard to the transactions of the government, on pain of incurring  the most severe penalties. Then, having settled the coronation oath,  they granted a commission to the earl of Argyle for the lords, to sir  James Montgomery for the knights, and to sir John Dalrymple for  the boroughs, empowering them to repair to London, and invest their  majesties with the government. This affair being discussed, the  convention appointed a committee to take care of the public peace, and  adjourned to the twenty-first day of May. On the eleventh day of that  month, the Scottish commissioners being introduced to their majesties at  Whitehall, presented first a preparatory letter from the estates, then  the instrument of government, with a paper containing a recital of the  grievances of the nation; and an address desiring his majesty to convert  the convention into a parliament. The king having graciously promised to  concur with them in all just measures for the interest of the kingdom,  the coronation oath was tendered to their majesties by the earl of  Argyle. As it contained a clause, importing that they should root out  heresy, the king declared, that he did not mean by these words that he  should be under an obligation to act as a persecutor: the commissioners  replying that such was not the meaning or import of the oath, he desired  them, and others present, to bear witness to the exception he had made.          THE CONVENTION STATE THEIR GRIEVANCES.    In the meantime lord Dundee exerted himself with uncommon activity in  behalf of his master. He had been summoned by a trumpet to return to the  convention, refused to obey the citation on pretence that the whigs had  made an attempt upon his life; and that the deliberations of the estates  were influenced by the neighbourhood of English troops, under the  command of Mackay. He was forthwith declared a fugitive, outlaw, and  rebel. He was rancorously hated by the pres-byterians, on whom he had  exercised some cruelties as an officer under the former government:  and for this reason the states resolved to inflict upon him exemplary  punishment. Parties were detached in pursuit of him and Balcarras. This  last fell into their hands, and was committed to a common prison;  but Dundee fought his way through the troops that surrounded him, and  escaped to the Highlands, where he determined to take arms in favour  of James, though that prince had forbid him to make any attempt of this  nature until he should receive a reinforcement from Ireland. While this  officer was employed in assembling the clans of his party, king  William appointed the duke of Hamilton commissioner to the convention  parliament. The post of secretary for Scotland was bestowed upon lord  Melvil, a weak and servile nobleman, who had taken refuge in Holland  from the violence of the late reigns: but the king depended chiefly for  advice upon Dalrymple lord Stair, president of the college of justice,  an old crafty fanatic, who for forty years had complied in all things  with all governments. Though these were rigid pres-byterians, the king,  to humour the opposite party, admitted some individuals of the episcopal  nobility to the council-board; and this intermixture, instead of  allaying animosities, served only to sow the seeds of discord and  confusion. The Scottish convention, in their detail of grievances,  enumerated the lords of the articles; the act of parliament in the reign  of Charles II. by which the king's supremacy was raised so high that he  could prescribe any mode of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#6)"],[1,"Lord Albemarle and  Admiral Pococke, in order to strike a severe blow against the commerce  of Spain in that quarter. This expedition was joined in the West Indies  by a strong squadron commanded by Sir James Douglas, and sailing through  the Straits of Bahama, it arrived before the Havannah on the 5th of  June. A landing was easily effected and siege was laid to the Moro,  a strong fort which defended the harbour, and which was considered  impregnable. The difficulties in making the approaches on a hard rocky  soil were great, and the troops suffered from sickness, fatigue, and  the fire of the enemy; but being joined by fresh reinforcements from New  York and our West Indian Islands, the fort was isolated from the town,  and it was then stormed through a narrow and perilous breach, and  carried at the point of the bayonet. The city of Havannah maintained the  siege a fortnight longer; but it was compelled to capitulate, and it was  yielded up with 180 miles of country westward, or all the best part of  the island of Cuba. Nine Spanish ships of the line and three frigates  were taken in the harbour, and three ships of the line and a galleon  were destroyed, while the booty that fell into the hands of the victors  amounted to L3,000,000 sterling. But the ultimate advantages of this  victory promised to be greater than its immediate results. By the  possession of the Havannah, indeed, England obtained the absolute  command of the passage pursued by the plate-fleets of Spain, and seemed  to lay the wealth of that country at her feet.    It was not in the western hemisphere alone, that the dominions of the  King of Spain were attacked. When the news of the war reached the  East Indies an armament was fitted out at Madras, under the command  of Admiral Cornish and Sir William Draper, which suddenly appeared  off Manilla, the capital of Luconia, and the surrounding isles. Draper  landed his forces and took possession of the suburbs of Manilla, before  the inhabitants were well aware of the war between Spain and England.  Manilla was governed by the archbishop, who proved by his conduct, that  like the ecclesiastics of the middle ages, he could both fight and say  mass. The archbishop excited the natives to assault the assailants in  the rear, while at the head of about eight hundred Spainards he opposed  them in front. The Indians fought with almost incredible ferocity; but  they were cut to pieces by the sword, or died gnawing with their teeth  the bayonets by which they were transfixed. The works of Manilla were  carried by storm, and Draper's forces, which were chiefly composed of  Sepoys and Lascars, began to plunder and destroy the city. The inner  citadel, however, remained uncaptured, and the archbishop with the  magistrates, and some of the garrison threw themselves into it for  safety. A capitulation ensued, by which the city and port of Manilla,  with several ships and the military stores, were surrendered to  England, while a ransom was given for all private property, amounting  to 4,000,000 dollars. The fruits of this important conquest did not  terminate here. Two ships were despatched from the British squadron  to intercept the rich galleon Phillippina, and though they missed this  prize, they captured the Santa Trinidad, a great Manilla and Acapulco  galleon, with a cargo valued at 3,000,000 dollars. The whole group of  islands then submitted to the English flag.    The English arms were equally successful in a series of attacks on  the remaining French West India Islands. Martinique, Grenada, the  Grenadines, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Tobago, were all captured by an  army under general Moncton and a squadron under Admiral Rodney, so that  England obtained possession of the entire chain of the Caribbees. It  was in vain that the French in that part of the world sought to stem the  onward progress of the British arms: they were overpowering, and being  hopeless of succour from their mother-country, the French everywhere  submitted to the conquerors.          FRANCE AND SPAIN DECLARE WAR AGAINST PORTUGAL.    Before the news of the loss of Havannah and Manilla reached the court  of Spain, that court had commenced a land campaign on the continent. A  close alliance had long subsisted between England and Portugal, whence  France and Spain at this period chose to consider the king of Portugal  as the creature of the King of England. These two powers therefore  determined on a rupture with Portugal, unless the Portuguese should  renounce their English alliance. Preparations were accordingly made  for an invasion of Portugal by France as well as by Spain, while in the  meantime a joint memorial was presented by the two powers, inviting the  king of that country to join the alliance of the Bourbons against Great  Britain, which they were pleased to designate \"the common enemy of all  maritime nations.\" At the same time they insisted that he should expel  all English merchants and English sojourners from his kingdom, and close  his ports to English shipping. It was added that ii he acceeded to these  proposals, his fortresses and sea-ports should be garrisoned by French  and Spanish troops to protect him from England's vengeance, but that  if he refused--and the answer was to be given within four days--he must  take the consequences of such a line of policy.    There were circumstances existing which ought to have disarmed all  hostility on the part of France and Spain towards Portugal, even if  that hostility had been founded in justice. The Portuguese had not yet  recovered from the effects of the earthquake which, in 1756, had reduced  a third part of Lisbon to a ruinous heap. Then again, the Portuguese  power was acknowledged to be weak; but, above all, the King of Portugal  was the near relation of the King of Spain. The weakness of the  Portuguese government, however, was rather a temptation than a barrier  to the view of the Spanish monarch, and as for the claims of kindred,  they were absorbed in his views of ambition. Portugal was incorporated  geographically, and he longed to incorporate it politically with Spain,  whence the claims of misfortune and kindred were overlooked by him.  Conscience, moreover, was not allowed to assert its sway over his  actions, for he had armed himself against its lawful power by leaving  the decision of peace or war to his Portuguese majesty. If he joined  the Bourbon alliance, well and good, for the forces of France and Spain  would obtain possession of Portugal at an easy rate; but if not, if  he still adhered to his old alliance with England, then it would be  manifest to all the world, if he lost the kingdom, it would be his own  fault: in such cheap estimation does ambition hold morality.    At this period, Portugal had not an army exceeding 20,000 men, and her  fleet was reduced to six ships of the line and a few frigates, while her  fortresses were in ruins. In such a desperate condition, therefore, it  might have been expected that, however repugnant to his inclinations,  the heir of the house of Braganza would have broken his alliance with  England, and have joined the Family Compact. Prudence would seem to have  dictated such a step, but he acted otherwise. He had spirit enough to  declare that he would never submit to such conditions; and the French  and Spanish ambassadors quitted Lisbon, while their armies on the  frontiers put themselves in motion towards his capital. Ruin seemed to  await the monarch of Portugal. Braganza, Miranda, and Torre de Moncorvo  were captured by the Marquis of Saria, who commanded the Spanish army  north of the Douro, while another body of Spanish troops penetrated  south of the Douro into Beira, and occupied a post near Almeida. But  the Spaniards were doomed to receive a check. The militia and the brave  peasantry of Portugal, assisted and directed by some British officers,  maintained a destructive war of posts on the forces of Saria, and thus  stemmed his onward progress till relief came from England.    On the 11th of May, George III. ordered the following message to be laid  before the house of commons:--\"His majesty, relying on the known zeal  and affection of his faithful commons, and considering that in  this conjuncture emergencies may arise, which may be of the utmost  importance, and be attended with the most pernicious consequences, if  proper means should not be immediately applied to prevent or defeat  them; and his majesty also taking into his most serious consideration  the imminent danger with which the kingdom of Portugal, an ancient and  natural ally of his crown, is threatened by the powers now in open  war with his majesty, and of what importance the preservation of that  kingdom is to the commercial interests of this country, is desirous that  the house would enable him to defray any extraordinary expenses of the  war incurred, or to be incurred for the service of the year 1762; and to  take all such measures as may be necessary to disappoint or defeat  any enterprises or designs of his enemies against his majesty or his  allies.\"    This message was favourably received; Pitt advocated the cause of our  ancient ally with fervour and eloquence, and the house of commons voted  L1,000,000 sterling for the purposes therein specified. And this vote  was followed by prompt and effective measures to arrest the arms of  France and Spain. Eight thousand British troops under the command  of Lord Tyrawley, the Earl of Loudon, General Townshend, Lord George  Lennox, and Brigadiers Crawford and Burgoyne, landed in Portugal, and  immediately commenced operations. At the same time the native Portuguese  army consented to submit to the command of the Count de la Lippe, an  active and experienced German officer, who had commanded the British  artillery in Germany. The events of this campaign were complicated and  various. Lippe concentrated the principal part of the Portuguese forces  at Puente de Marcello, to prevent "]]]
