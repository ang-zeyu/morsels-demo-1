In two months the sergeant came round again. He did not bring his box  with him, having left it at his last halting place; telling James, who  happened to meet him as he came into Sidmouth, that he did not mean to  bring his show there again.    \"It will be better for the child,\" he explained. \"She has done with the  peep show now, and I do not want her to be any longer associated with  it.\"    Aggie was delighted to see him, and sprang into his arms, with a scream  of joy, as he entered. After a few minutes' talk, Mrs. Walsham  suggested that she should put on her hat and go for a walk with him,  and, in high contentment, the child trotted off, holding her  grandfather's hand. Turning to the left, the sergeant took the path up  the hill, and when he reached the top, sat down on the short turf, with  Aggie nestling up against him.    \"So you are quite well and happy, Aggie?\" he asked.    \"Quite well, grampa, and very happy; but I do wish so much that you  were here. Oh. it would be so nice to have you to go out with every  day!\"    \"I am afraid that cannot be managed, Aggie. I have been busy so long  that I could not settle down quietly here. Besides, I must live, you  know.\"    \"But wouldn't people give you money for the show if you lived here,  grampa? You always got money here the same as other places.\"    \"Yes, my dear, but I could not get fresh pictures every day, and should  soon tire them by showing the old house.\"    \"But you are sorry sometimes, grampa, not to have me with you?\"    \"Yes, Aggie, very sorry. I miss you terribly sometimes, and I am always  thinking about you.\"    \"Then why don't you take me away again, grampa?\"    \"Because, as I told you, Aggie, I want you to learn to read, and to  grow up quite a little lady.\"    \"Does reading make one a lady, grampa?\"    \"No, Aggie, not by itself, but with other things.\"    \"And when I am quite grown up and big, and know how to read nicely,  shall I be able to go with you again?\"    \"We will see about that, Aggie, when the time comes. There is plenty of  time yet to think about that.\"    \"But I am getting on very fast, grampa, and the lady says I am a good  girl. So it won't be such a very long time before I can leave.\"    \"It will be some time, yet. You have only got to read little words yet,  but there are lots of long words which you will come to presently. But  Mrs. Walsham tells me that you are getting on nicely, and that you are  a very good girl, which pleases me very much; and when I am walking  along with my box, I shall like to be able to think of you as being  quite comfortable and happy.\"    \"And I go walks with Jim, grampa, and Jim has made me a boat, and he  says someday, when it is very fine and quiet, he will take me out in a  big boat, like that boat, you know; and he is going to ask you if he  may, for the lady said I must not go out with him till he has asked  you. And he said he won't let me tumble over, and I am going to sit  quite, quite still.\"    \"Yes, Aggie, I don't see any harm in your going out with him. I am sure  he will only take you when it is fine, and he will look after you well.  You like him, don't you?\"    \"Oh! I do, grampa; and you know, it was him who got me out of the  water, else I should never have come out, and never have seen grampa  again; and he has made me a boat. Oh! yes, I do like him!\"    \"That's right, my dear; always stick to those who are good to you.\"    A few days after this, as James was sailing the toy boat, for Aggie's  amusement, in a pool, a boy sauntered up. He was somewhat taller than  James Walsham, and at least two years older. He was well dressed, and  James knew him as the nephew and heir of the squire.    It was not often that Richard Horton came down into the village. He was  accustomed to be treated with a good deal of deference at the Hall, and  to order servants and grooms about pretty much as he chose, and the  indifference with which the fisher boys regarded him offended him  greatly. He was a spoilt boy. His uncle had a resident tutor for him,  but the selection had been a bad one. The library was large and good,  the tutor fond of reading, and he was content to let the boy learn as  little as he chose, providing that he did not trouble him. As to any  instruction beyond books, he never thought of giving it.    The squire never interfered. He was a silent and disappointed man. He  attended to his duties as a magistrate, and to the management of his  estate, but seldom went beyond the lodge gates. He took his meals by  himself, and often did not see his nephew for a week together, and had  no idea but that he was pursuing his studies regularly with his tutor.  Thus, the character of Richard Horton formed itself unchecked. At the  best it was a bad one, but under other circumstances it might have been  improved.    Up to the age of ten, he had lived in London with his father and  mother, the latter a sister of the squire, who, having married beneath  her, to the indignation of Mr. Linthorne, he had never seen her  afterwards.    Four years before the story begins, she had received a letter from him,  saying that, as her eldest son was now his heir, he wished him to come  and live with him, and be prepared to take his place. The Hortons, who  had a numerous family, at once accepted the offer, and Richard, hearing  that he was going to a grand house, and would no doubt have a pony and  all sorts of nice things, left his father and mother without a tear.    He was essentially selfish. He was vain of his good looks, which were  certainly striking; and with his changed fortunes he became arrogant,  and, as the squire's servants said, hateful; and yet the change had  brought him less pleasure than he expected. It was true that he had the  pony, that he was not obliged to trouble himself with lessons, that he  was an important person at the \"Hall;\" but he had no playfellows, no  one to admire his grandeur, and the days often passed heavily, and  there was a look of discontent and peevishness upon his handsome face.    Perhaps the reason why he so seldom came down into Sidmouth, was not  only because the fisher boys were not sufficiently impressed with his  importance, but because they looked so much happier and more contented  than he felt, in spite of his numerous advantages. On this day he was  in a particularly bad temper. He had lamed his pony the day before, by  riding it furiously over a bad road after it had cast a shoe. The  gardener had objected to his picking more than half a dozen peaches  which had just come into perfection, and had threatened to appeal to  the squire.    Altogether, he was out of sorts, and had walked down to the sea with a  vague hope that something might turn up to amuse him. He stood for some  little time watching James sail the boat, and then strode down to the  edge of the pool. The boat was a model of a smack, with brown sails.  James had taken a good deal of pains with it, and it was an excellent  model.    Presently, in crossing, she stuck in a shallow some twelve feet from  the edge. The intervening stretch of water was a foot deep.    James picked up some small stones and threw them close to her, that the  tiny wave they made might float her off. He tried several times without  success.    \"What's the use of such little stones as that?\" Richard said roughly.  \"You will never get her off like that;\" and picking up one as large as  his fist, he threw it with some force.    It struck the mast, and broke it asunder, and knocked the boat on to  her side. James Walsham uttered an angry exclamation.    \"You are a bad boy,\" Aggie said passionately. \"You are a bad boy to  break my boat;\" and she burst into tears.    \"I didn't mean to do it, you little fool!\" Richard said angrily, vexed  more at his own clumsiness than at the damage it had caused. \"What are  you making such a beastly noise about?\" and he gave her a push.    It was not a hard one, but the ground was slippery, and the child's  foot slipped, and she fell at the edge of the pool, her dress going  partly into the water. At the same instant, Richard reeled, and almost  fell beside her, from a heavy blow between the eyes from James's fist.    \"You insolent blackguard!\" he exclaimed furiously, \"I will pay you for  this;\" and he rushed at James.    The combat was not a long one. Hard work at rowing and sailing had  strengthened Jim Walsham's muscles, and more than balanced the  advantage in height and age of his adversary. He had had, too, more  than one fight in his time, and after the first sudden burst of  passion, caused by the overthrow of Aggie, he fought coolly and  steadily, while Richard rained his blows wildly, without attempting to  guard his face.    The child, on regaining her feet, ran crying loudly towards the beach,  making for two fishermen who were engaged in mending a net some  distance away; but before she could reach them to beg for aid for her  champion, the fight was over, terminating by a heavy right-handed hit  from James, which landed Richard Horton on his back in the pool.    James stood quietly awaiting a renewal of the conflict when he arose,  but Richard had had enough of it. One of his eyes was already puffed  and red, his nose bleeding, and his lip cut. His clothes were soaked  from head to foot, and smeared with the red mud.    \"I will pay you out for this, you see if I don't,\" Richard gasped  hoarsely.    \"What! have you had enough of it?\" James said scornfully. \"I thought  you weren't any good. A fellow who would bully a little girl is sure to  be a coward.\"    Richard moved as if he would renew the fight, but he thought better of  it, and with a furious exclamation hurried away towards the Hall.    James, without paying any further heed to him, waded after the boat,  and having recovered it, walked off towards the child, who, on seeing  his opponent had moved off, was running down to meet him.    \"H"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#6)"],[1,"the green grass in the garden, and smell  the sweet flowers, and even hear the water splashing into the  fountain. She had never seen anyone walking in the garden, for it  belonged to an old gentleman who did not care about grass and flowers.    One day in the autumn her mother told her that the old gentleman had  gone away, and had rented his house to a family of little American  children, who had come with their sick mother to spend the winter in  Italy. After this, Piccola was never lonely, for all day long the  children ran and played and danced and sang in the garden. It was  several weeks before they saw her at all, and I am not sure they ever  would have done so but one day the kitten ran away, and in chasing her  they came close to the wall and saw Piccola's black eyes looking  through the hole in the stones. They were a little frightened at  first, and did not speak to her; but the next day she was there again,  and Rose, the oldest girl, went up to the wall and talked to her a  little while. When the children found that she had no one to play with  and was very lonely, they talked to her every day, and often brought  her fruits and candies, and passed them through the hole in the wall.    One day they even pushed the kitten through; but the hole was hardly  large enough for her, and she mewed and scratched and was very much  frightened. After that the little boy said he would ask his father if  the hole might not be made larger, and then Piccola could come in and  play with them. The father had found out that Piccola's mother was a  good woman, and that the little girl herself was sweet and kind, so  that he was very glad to have some of the stones broken away and an  opening made for Piccola to come in.    How excited she was, and how glad the children were when she first  stepped into the garden! She wore her best dress, a long,  bright-colored woolen skirt and a white waist. Round her neck was a  string of beads, and on her feet were little wooden shoes. It would  seem very strange to us--would it not?--to wear wooden shoes; but  Piccola and her mother had never worn anything else, and never had any  money to buy stockings. Piccola almost always ran about barefooted,  like the kittens and the chickens and the little ducks. What a good  time they had that day, and how glad Piccola's mother was that her  little girl could have such a pleasant, safe place to play in, while  she was away at work!    By and by December came, and the little Americans began to talk about  Christmas. One day, when Piccola's curly head and bright eyes came  peeping through the hole in the wall, and they ran to her and helped  her in; and as they did so, they all asked her at once what she  thought she would have for a Christmas present. \"A Christmas present!\"  said Piccola. \"Why, what is that?\"    All the children looked surprised at this, and Rose said, rather  gravely, \"Dear Piccola, don't you know what Christmas is?\"    Oh, yes, Piccola knew it was the happy day when the baby Christ was  born, and she had been to church on that day and heard the beautiful  singing, and had seen the picture of the Babe lying in the manger,  with cattle and sheep sleeping round about. Oh, yes, she knew all that  very well, but what was a Christmas present?    Then the children began to laugh and to answer her all together. There  was such a clatter of tongues that she could hear only a few of the  words now and then, such as \"chimney,\" \"Santa Claus,\" \"stockings,\"  \"reindeer,\" \"Christmas Eve,\" \"candies and toys.\" Piccola put her hands  over her ears and said, \"Oh, I can't understand one word. You tell me,  Rose.\" Then Rose told her all about jolly Santa Claus, with his red  cheeks and white beard and fur coat, and about his reindeer and sleigh  full of toys. \"Every Christmas Eve,\" said Rose, \"he comes down the  chimney, and fills the stockings of all the good children; so,  Piccola, you hang up your stocking, and who knows what a beautiful  Christmas present you will find when morning comes!\" Of course Piccola  thought this was a delightful plan, and was very pleased to hear about  it. Then all the children told her of every Christmas Eve they could  remember, and of the presents they had had; so that she went home  thinking of nothing but dolls and hoops and balls and ribbons and  marbles and wagons and kites.    She told her mother about Santa Claus, and her mother seemed to think  that perhaps he did not know there was any little girl in that house,  and very likely he would not come at all. But Piccola felt very sure  Santa Claus would remember her, for her little friends had promised to  send a letter up the chimney to remind him.    Christmas Eve came at last. Piccola's mother hurried home from her  work; they had their little supper of soup and bread, and soon it was  bedtime,--time to get ready for Santa Claus. But oh! Piccola  remembered then for the first time that the children had told her she  must hang up her stocking, and she hadn't any, and neither had her  mother.    How sad, how sad it was! Now Santa Claus would come, and perhaps be  angry because he couldn't find any place to put the present.    The poor little girl stood by the fireplace, and the big tears began  to run down her cheeks. Just then her mother called to her, \"Hurry,  Piccola; come to bed.\" What should she do? But she stopped crying, and  tried to think; and in a moment she remembered her wooden shoes, and  ran off to get one of them. She put it close to the chimney, and said  to herself, \"Surely Santa Claus will know what it's there for. He will  know I haven't any stockings, so I gave him the shoe instead.\"    Then she went off happily to her bed, and was asleep almost as soon as  she had nestled close to her mother's side.    The sun had only just begun to shine, next morning, when Piccola  awoke. With one jump she was out on the floor and running toward the  chimney. The wooden shoe was lying where she had left it, but you  could never, never guess what was in it.    Piccola had not meant to wake her mother, but this surprise was more  than any little girl could bear and yet be quiet; so she danced to the  bed with the shoe in her hand, calling, \"Mother, mother! look, look!  see the present Santa Claus brought me!\"    Her mother raised her head and looked into the shoe. \"Why, Piccola,\"  she said, \"a little chimney swallow nestling in your shoe? What a good  Santa Claus to bring you a bird!\"    \"Good Santa Claus, dear Santa Claus!\" cried Piccola; and she kissed  her mother and kissed the bird and kissed the shoe, and even threw  kisses up the chimney, she was so happy.    When the birdling was taken out of the shoe, they found that he did  not try to fly, only to hop about the room; and as they looked closer,  they could see that one of his wings was hurt a little. But the mother  bound it up carefully, so that it did not seem to pain him, and he was  so gentle that he took a drink of water from a cup, and even ate  crumbs and seeds out of Piccola's hands. She was a proud little girl  when she took her Christmas present to show the children in the  garden. They had had a great many gifts,--dolls that could say  \"mamma,\" bright picture books, trains of cars, toy pianos; but not one  of their playthings was alive, like Piccola's birdling. They were as  pleased as she, and Rose hunted about the house until she found a  large wicker cage that belonged to a blackbird she once had. She gave  the cage to Piccola, and the swallow seemed to make himself quite at  home in it at once, and sat on the perch winking his bright eyes at  the children. Rose had saved a bag of candies for Piccola, and when  she went home at last, with the cage and her dear swallow safely  inside it, I am sure there was not a happier little girl in the whole  country of Italy.

The wind blows chilly from the  west, but the rock will shelter us. The sky is fair and the moon is  rising, and we can sit here and watch the flocks on the hillside  below. Your young blood and your father's coat of skins will keep you  warm for one watch, I am sure. At midnight, my son, your father,  Reuben, and his brother James will take our places; for the first  watch the old man and the boy will tend the sheep.\"    \"Yes, grandfather; you shall sit in that snug corner of the rock,  where you can lean back and take your comfort. I will lie here at your  feet. Now and then I will run to see whether the sheep are wandering,  and that will warm me, if I grow cold.\"    \"Have you never been out on the hills at night with your father?\"    \"Never, grandfather. I have often begged him to let me come; but he  kept saying that I must wait until I was twelve years old. On the last  full moon was my birthday and today, when he returned from Bethlehem  to the flocks, he brought me with him.\"    \"So this is the lad's first night with the sheep in the fields, and  the old man's last night, I fear,\" said the aged shepherd, sadly. \"It  is not often in these days that I venture out to keep the watches of  the flock; but this one night of the year I have spent upon these  hills these many years, and I always shall as long as I have strength  to walk so far.\"    \"Was your father, too, a shepherd?\"    \"Yes, and all his fathers before him for many generations. On these  hills my ancestors have kept their sheep for I know not how long.\"    Joseph was still for a moment. His eyes wandered away over the silent  hills, lit by the rising moon. His face was troubled. At length, he  said gently:    \"Grandfather, I heard Rabbi Eliezer saying, the other day, in the  synagogue, that a shepherd's life is not a noble life. He was"]]]
