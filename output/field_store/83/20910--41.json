But a case in point may be cited, which proves that the  dissatisfaction is not general, nor has ever been during the present  reign. From the time that Louis-Philippe accepted the throne in 1830,  until June the 6th, 1832, a number of young men in the different  colleges at Paris occupied themselves constantly with the affairs of the  state, each forming a sort of political utopia, and however different  were their various theories, they all united in one object, and that was  to overthrow the existing government, and secretly took measures for  arming themselves, and mustering what strength they could collect in  point of numbers, which was but very insignificant compared to the  importance of the blow they intended to strike; but they counted on the  rising of the people, and the event proved they counted without their  host. June the 6th, 1832, being the day appointed for the funeral of  General Lamarque, they chose it for the development of their project,  and although the misguided youths fought with skill, constancy and  courage, even with a fanatic devotion to their cause, yet the populace  took no part with them, and the National Guard were the first to fire  upon them; and after two days hard fighting in the barricades they had  raised, scarcely any remained who were not either killed or wounded.  Since that, no attempt of the slightest importance has been made to  overthrow the government, and in fact I have ever found that ninety-nine  Parisians out of a hundred exclaim \"_Tranquillite a tout prix_,\" that is  quiet at all prices, and all classes are interested in cherishing this  wish, the nobles and gentry that they may tranquilly enjoy what they  possess, the tradesman that he may obtain a sale for his goods, and the  workman that he may procure work. It is only a set of political  enthusiasts, to be found amongst the students, whose wild republican  schemes have dazzled others and induced the different outbreaks which  have occurred since the event of the three days, and having been treated  with lenity in the first instance, unprecedented in the annals of every  other government, they were emboldened to repeat their daring attempts.    But let any one traverse the provinces of France, get acquainted with  the people, make inquiries around him and penetrate into their habits  and customs, and he will find that the predominant feeling is love of  the spot on which they are born; the farmer will keep on the farm his  ancestors tilled before him for ages, and if offered a better farm, if  it be far removed from his home and that of his fathers he will reject  it; with the same tenacity the labourer clings to his cottage and the  little bit of land he has always delved. But it is with the landed  proprietor that one finds the most powerful example of the durability of  their adhesion to the cradle of their birth. There are many persons  possessed of estates of no great extent, from eight to fifteen hundred a  year, which have regularly descended to them from their ancestors, to  whom they have been granted, at as remote a period as the time of  Charlemagne, and have descended to the present possessors from  generation to generation, whilst there does not appear to have been in  all that period any great elevation or depression in their  circumstances. The habit of living up to their incomes as in England is  very rare in France; if they have daughters, from the day they are born  the parents begin to save for their dowry; even the peasant will follow  that practice if he can only put by a sou a day. I have known many  landed proprietors of from fifteen hundred to two thousand a year that  did not support any thing like the style that a person with a similar  fortune would in England; if a Frenchman has more than two or three  children, he seldom spends half his income if it be possible to live  upon a quarter, his object is that he may leave all his children in an  equal pecuniary position without dividing his land; as although the law  of primogeniture does not exist, yet parents like that one son should  keep up the estate intact, and the one fixed upon for that purpose is  generally the eldest, the others receive their portions in money from  the father's savings, and are usually brought up to one of the liberal  professions, and in many instances are sufficiently fortunate as to  realize by promotion or their talents, emoluments equal with what  portion they inherit to place them in as favourable a position as the  brother on whom devolves the estate. In other instances the son who  holds the land is taxed to pay from it a certain amount to his brothers  and sisters, in order to render their situation in life somewhat upon a  par; but it so happens that very large families are not so frequent in  France as in England. A system of frugality is prevalent amongst all  classes of the French, and a habit of contenting themselves with but  little as regards their daily expenses; nor have they that ambition to  step out of their class so general throughout England. A farmer in  France works much the same as his men, dresses in a plain decent manner,  and considers himself very little superior to his men, whilst his wife  goes to market with her butter and eggs upon one of the farm horses; and  without any education herself she thinks she does wonders in having her  daughters taught to read, write and cypher, but invariably economises to  give them a marriage portion. This applies to most of the farmers  throughout France, and will be found descriptive of those inhabiting the  country from Calais to Paris; but in Normandy they are frequently what  is in French estimation considered very rich, and their habits and  expenses are in proportion; and about Melun and some few parts of France  where the farms are very large, the occupiers would even in England be  termed wealthy. The extreme of poverty or what may be designated misery  is but little known; the traveller is deceived by the number of beggars  which infest the high roads, and is induced to imagine that the lowest  orders must be in a most wretched state, but the fact is otherwise, and  begging is no other than a trade on the most frequented roads. Turn into  the by-lanes, penetrate the interior of the country and in the villages  distant from the highways and but few beggars are to be found, nor could  I ever hear of an instance of any one in the country parts of France  perishing from want; yet there are no forced poor rates, the landed  proprietors however regularly give so much a month voluntarily to those  who are past labour and have no relations to provide for them, and  houseless and pennyless wanderers are received and sheltered for a night  by the higher farmers and people of property, the mendicant having soup  and bread given him at night and the same when he starts in the morning.  Of these there are great numbers within the last few years, being  refugees from Spain, Italy and even Poland, driven to seek shelter where  they can find it by the political convulsions of their countries. In  this manner, the French have recently been severely taxed, but they  appear never to have the heart to deny shelter and food, although they  carry economy to such a height as would be styled by many of my affluent  countrymen absolute parsimony; which is perceptible in all their  transactions, and is in a great degree the cause of the miserable state  of their agriculture, which is also in some measure owing to the utter  ignorance of the farmers, who in all that tends towards improvement  display the stupidity of asses with the obstinacy of mules. There can be  no doubt that, generally speaking, the soil of France is capable of  producing half as much more than it at present yields; they still  persevere in the same system as existed in England in the year 1770,  when Arthur Young wrote his Agricultural Tour, describing the various  practices in the different counties throughout the kingdom. Two white  crops and a summer fallow is the usual course in France, sometimes  varied by a crop of clover, and very often they fallow for two years  together; they have no idea of leguminous crops as winter provision for  their cattle, and of the advantage to be derived from stall feeding they  are quite ignorant, except in a few provinces, as a part of Normandy and  Brittany. The same with regard to the drill system; they mostly plough  very shallow, and do not keep their land very clean, with a few  exceptions; the consequence is their crops are generally very light.  Thanks to the natural richness of their meadows in Normandy, they do  certainly produce some beasts of an immense weight for the exhibition  annually held on Shrove Tuesday. There are generally about a dozen  brought to Paris, and the finest is the one selected to be led about the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#6)"],[1," with us in this building. This person has not spoken.  If he will do so now, he will save us and himself, too, no end of  trouble. Let him speak, then. I will give him five minutes in which to  make this acknowledgment. Five minutes! If that man is wise--or can it  be a woman?--he will not keep us waiting.\"    Silence. Heads moving, eyes peering, excitement visible in every face,  but not a word from anybody. Mr. Gryce turned and pointed up at the  clock. All looked--but still no word from man or woman.    One minute gone!    Two minutes!    Three!    The silence had become portentous. The movement, involuntary and  simultaneous, which had run through the crowd at first had stopped. They  were waiting--each and all--waiting with eyes on the minute-hand creeping  forward over the dial toward which the detective's glance was still  turned.    The fourth minute passed--then the fifth--and no one had spoken.    With a sigh Mr. Gryce wheeled himself back and faced the crowd again.    \"You see,\" he quietly announced, \"the case is serious. Twenty-two of you,  and not one to speak the half-dozen words which would release the rest  from their present embarrassing position! What remains for us to do under  circumstances like these? My experience suggests but one course: to  narrow down this inquiry to those--you will not find them many--who from  their nearness to the place of tragedy or from some other cause equally  pertinent may be looked upon as possible witnesses for the Coroner's  jury. That this may be done speedily and surely, I am going to ask you,  every one of you, to retake the exact place in the building which you  were occupying when you heard the first alarm. I will begin with the  Curator himself. Mr. Jewett, will you be so good as to return to the  room, and if possible to the precise spot, you were occupying when you  first learned what had occurred here?\"    The Curator, who stood at his elbow, made a quick bow and turned in the  direction of the marble steps, which he hastily remounted. A murmur from  the crowd followed this action and continued till he disappeared in the  recesses of the right-hand gallery. Then, at a gesture from Mr. Gryce, it  suddenly ceased, and with a breathless interest easy to comprehend, they  one and all waited for his next word. It was a simple one.    \"We are all obliged to Mr. Jewett for his speedy compliance with so  unusual a request. He has made my task a comparatively easy one.\"    Then, glancing at the list of names and addresses which had been compiled  for him by Sweetwater, he added:    \"I will read off your names as recorded here. If each person, on hearing  his own, will move quickly to his place and remain there till my young  man can make a note of the same, we shall get through this matter in  short order. And let me add\"--as he perceived here and there a shoulder  shrugged, or an eye turned askance--\"that once the name is called, no  excuse of non-recollection will be accepted. You must know, every one of  you, just where you were standing when the cry of death rang out, and any  attempt to mislead me or others in this matter will only subject the  person making it to a suspicion he must wish to avoid. Remember that  there are enough persons here for no one to be sure that his whereabouts  at so exciting a moment escaped notice. Listen, then, and when your own  name is spoken, step quickly into place, whether that place be on this  floor or in the rooms or galleries above.--Mrs. Alice Lee!\"    You can imagine the flurry, the excitement and the blank looks of the  average men and women he addressed. But not one hesitated to obey. Mrs.  Lee was on the farther side of one of the statues before her name had  more than left his lips. Her example set the pace for those who followed.  Like soldiers at roll-call, each one responded to the summons, going now  in one direction and now in another until on reaching the proper spot he  or she stopped.    Only six persons followed the Curator upstairs--an old woman who shook  her head violently as she plodded slowly up the marble steps; Correy; a  man with a packet of books under his arm (the same who had been studying  coins in Section II); a young couple whose movements showed such a marked  reluctance that more than one eye followed them as they went hesitatingly  up, clinging together with interlocking hands and stopping now on one  step and now on another to stare at each other in visible consternation;  and a boy of fourteen who grinned from ear to ear as he bounded gayly  up three steps at a time and took his position on the threshold of one  of the upper doors with all the precision of a soldier called to  sentry-duty--a boy scout if ever there was one.    There were twenty-two names on the list, and with the calling out of the  twenty-second, Mr. Gryce perceived the space before him entirely cleared  of its odd assortment of people. As he turned to take a look at the  result, a gleam of satisfaction crossed his time-worn face. By this  scheme, which he may be pardoned for looking upon as a stroke of genius  worthy of his brilliant prime, he had set back time a full hour,  restoring as by a magician's wand the conditions of that fatal moment of  initial alarm. Surely, with the knowledge of that hidden bow in his mind,  he should be able now to place his hand upon the person who had made use  of it to launch the fatal arrow. No one, however sly of foot and quick of  action, could have gone far from the gallery where that bow lay in the  few minutes which were all that could have elapsed between the shooting  of the arrow and the gasping cry which had brought all within hearing to  the Apache section. The man or woman whom he should find nearest to that  concealed door in the northern gallery would have to give a very good  account of himself. Not even the Curator would escape suspicion under  those circumstances.    However, it is only fair to add that Mr. Gryce had no fear of any such  embarrassing end to his inquisition as that. He had noticed the young  couple who had betrayed their alarm so ingenuously to every eye, and had  already decided within himself that the man was just such a fool as might  in a moment of vacuity pick up a bow and arrow to test his skill at a  given mark. Such things had been and such results had followed. The man  was a gawk and the woman a ninny; a few questions and their guiltiness  would appear--that is, if they should be found near enough the tapestry  to warrant his suspicion. If not--the alternative held an interest all  its own, and sent him in haste toward the stairway.    To reach it Mr. Gryce had to pass several persons standing where fate had  fixed them among the statuary grouped about the court, and had his  attention been less engrossed by what he expected to discover above, he  would have been deeply interested in noting how these persons, or most of  them at least, had so thoroughly accepted the situation that they had  taken the exact position and the exact attitude of the moment preceding  the alarm. Those who were admiring the great torsos or carved chariots of  the ancients, made a show of admiring them still. The man or woman who  had been going in an easterly direction, faced east; and those who had  been on the point of entering certain rooms, stood halting in the  doorways with their backs to the court.    Unfortunately, he did not take note of all this, or give the poor pawns  thus parading for his purpose more than a cursory glance. When he did  think, which was when he was halfway up the staircase, it was to look  back upon a changed scene. For with his going, interest had flagged and  the tableau lost its pointedness. No one had ventured as yet to leave his  place, but all had turned their faces his way, and on many of these faces  could be seen signs of fatigue if not of absolute impatience. He had  ordered them to stand and they had stood, but to be left there while he  went above was certainly trying. The one spot which held the interest was  in the southern gallery. If they could only follow him there----    All this was to be seen in their faces, and possibly the cunning old man  read it there; but if he did, it was to ask himself if their conclusions  were quite correct. The locale of interest had shifted in the last half  hour; and while most of these people believed him to be searching for the  witness who could tell him what had occurred in the death gallery, he  really was hunting for one who could add to his knowledge of what had  happened in the opposite one. And this witness might not be found in the  gallery, or even on the upper floor. It was well among the probabilities  that there might be among the various persons he saw posing in the court  below some who by an upward look might take in a part of if not the whole  broad sweep of that huge square of tapestry upon which his thoughts were  centered. It was for him to make a note of these persons. A diagram of  the court as it looked to him at that moment is shown for your  enlightenment.

As the action has now shifted to the upper floor, a diagram of this  second story is now in order.
