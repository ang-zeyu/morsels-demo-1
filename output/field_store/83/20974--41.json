There isn't a lazy bone in him--not one.  The bark he likes best is from the aspen. When he cannot get that, he  will eat the bark from the poplar, the alder, the willow, and even the  birch. But he likes the aspen so much better that he will work very hard  to get it. Perhaps it tastes better because he does have to work so hard  for it.    There were some aspen-trees growing right on the edge of the pond Paddy  had made in the Green Forest. These he cut just as he had cut the trees  for his dam. As soon as a tree was down, he would cut it into short  lengths, and with these swim out to where the water was deep, close to  his new house. He took them one by one and carried the first ones to the  bottom, where he pushed them into the mud just enough to hold them.  Then, as fast as he brought more, he piled them on the first ones. And  so the pile grew and grew.    Jerry Muskrat, Peter Rabbit, Bobby Coon, and the other little people of  the Green Forest watched him with the greatest interest and curiosity.  They couldn't quite make out what he was doing. It was almost as if he  were building the foundation for another house.    \"What's he doing, Jerry?\" demanded Peter, when he could keep still  no longer.    \"I don't exactly know,\" replied Jerry. \"He said that he was going to  lay in a supply of food for the winter, just as I told you, and I  suppose that is what he is doing. But I don't quite understand what he  is taking it all out into the pond for. I believe I'll go ask him.\"    \"Do, and then come tell us,\" begged Peter, who was growing so curious  that he couldn't sit still.    So Jerry swam out to where Paddy was so busy. \"Is this your food supply,  Cousin Paddy?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" replied Paddy, crawling up on the side of his house to rest.  \"Yes, this is my food supply. Isn't it splendid?\"    \"I guess it is,\" replied Jerry, trying to be polite, \"though I like  lily-roots and clams better. But what are you going to do with it? Where  is your storehouse?\"    \"This pond is my storehouse,\" replied Paddy. \"I will make a great pile  right here close to my house, and the water will keep it nice and fresh  all winter. When the pond is frozen over, all I will have to do is to  slip out of one of my doorways down there on the bottom, swim over here  and get a stick, and fill my stomach. Isn't it handy?\"    [Illustration]          XIV    A FOOTPRINT IN THE MUD      Very early one morning Paddy the Beaver heard Sammy Jay making a  terrible fuss over in the aspen-trees on the edge of the pond Paddy  had made in the Green Forest. Paddy couldn't see because he was inside  his house, and it has no window, but he could hear. He wrinkled up his  brows thoughtfully.    \"Seems to me that Sammy is very much excited this morning,\" said he,  talking to himself, a way he has because he is so much alone. \"When he  screams like that, Sammy is usually trying to do two things at  once--make trouble for somebody and keep somebody else out of trouble;  and when you come to think of it, that's rather a funny way of doing. It  shows that he isn't all bad, and at the same time he is a long way from  being all good. Now, I should say from the sounds that Sammy has  discovered Reddy Fox trying to steal up on some one over where my  aspen-trees are growing. Reddy is afraid of me, but I suspect that he  knows that Peter Rabbit has been hanging around here a lot lately,  watching me work, and he thinks perhaps he can catch Peter. I shall have  to whisper in one of Peter's long ears and tell him to watch out.\"    After a while he heard Sammy Jay's voice growing fainter and fainter in  the Green Forest. Finally he couldn't hear it at all. \"Whoever was there  has gone away, and Sammy has followed just to torment them,\" thought  Paddy. He was very busy making a bed. He is very particular about his  bed, is Paddy the Beaver. He makes it of fine splinters of wood which he  splits off with those wonderful great cutting teeth of his. This makes  the driest kind of a bed. It requires a great deal of patience and work,  but patience is one of the first things a little Beaver learns, and  honest work well done is one of the greatest pleasures in the world, as  Paddy long ago found out for himself. So he kept at work on his bed for  some time after all was still outside.    At last Paddy decided that he would go over to his aspen-trees and look  them over to decide which ones he would cut the next night. He slid down  one of his long halls, out the doorway at the bottom of the pond, and  then swam up to the surface, where he floated for a few minutes with  just his head out of water. And all the time his eyes and nose and ears  were busy looking, smelling, and listening for any sign of danger.  Everything was still. Sure that he was quite safe, Paddy swam across to  the place where the aspen-trees grew, and waddled out on the shore.    Paddy looked this way and looked that way. He looked up in the tree  tops, and he looked off up the hill, but most of all he looked at the  ground. Yes, Sir, Paddy just studied the ground. You see, he hadn't  forgotten the fuss Sammy Jay had been making there, and he was trying to  find out what it was all about. At first he didn't see anything unusual,  but by and by he happened to notice a little wet place, and right in the  middle of it was something that made Paddy's eyes open wide. It was a  footprint! Some one had carelessly stepped in the mud.    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Paddy, and the hair on his back lifted ever so little,  and for a minute he had a prickly feeling all over. The footprint was  very much like that of Reddy Fox, only it was larger.    \"Ha!\" said Paddy again, \"that certainly is the footprint of Old Man  Coyote! I see I have got to watch out more sharply than I had thought  for. All right, Mr. Coyote; now that I know you are about, you'll have  to be smarter than I think you are to catch me. You certainly will be  back here to-night looking for me, so I think I'll do my cutting right  now in the daytime.\"          XV    SAMMY JAY MAKES PADDY A CALL      Paddy the Beaver was hard at work. He had just cut down a good-sized  aspen-tree and now he was gnawing it into short lengths to put in his  food pile in the pond. As he worked, Paddy was doing a lot of thinking  about the footprint of Old Man Coyote in a little patch of mud, for he  knew that meant that Old Man Coyote had discovered his pond, and would  be hanging around, hoping to catch Paddy off his guard. Paddy knew it  just as well as if Old Man Coyote had told him so. That was why he was  at work cutting his food supply in the daytime. Usually he works at  night, and he knew that Old Man Coyote knew it.    \"He'll try to catch me then,\" thought Paddy, \"so I'll do my working on  land now and fool him.\"    The tree he was cutting began to sway and crack. Paddy cut out one  more big chip, then hurried away to a safe place while the tree fell  with a crash.    \"Thief! thief! thief!\" screamed a voice just back of Paddy.    \"Hello, Sammy Jay! I see you don't feel any better than usual this  morning,\" said Paddy. \"Don't you want to sit up in this tree while I  cut it down?\"    Sammy grew black in the face with anger, for he knew that Paddy was  laughing at him. You remember how only a few days before he had been so  intent on calling Paddy bad names that he actually hadn't noticed that  Paddy was cutting the very tree in which he was sitting, and so when it  fell he had had a terrible fright.    \"You think you are very smart, Mr. Beaver, but you'll think differently  one of these fine days!\" screamed Sammy. \"If you knew what I know, you  wouldn't be so well satisfied with yourself.\"    \"What do you know?\" asked Paddy, pretending to be very much alarmed.    \"I'm not going to tell you what I know,\" retorted Sammy Jay. \"You'll  find out soon enough. And when you do find out, you'll never steal  another tree from our Green Forest. Somebody is going to catch you,  and it isn't Farmer Brown's boy either!\"    Paddy pretended to be terribly frightened. \"Oh, who is it? Please tell  me, Mr. Jay,\" he begged.    Now to be called Mr. Jay made Sammy feel very important. Nearly  everybody else called him Sammy. He swelled himself out trying to look  as important as he felt, and his eyes snapped with pleasure. He was  actually making Paddy the Beaver afraid. At least he thought he was.    \"No, Sir, I won't tell you,\" he replied. \"I wouldn't be you for a great  deal though! Somebody who is smarter than you are is going to catch you,  and when he gets through with you, there won't be anything left but a  few bones. No, Sir, nothing but a few bones!\"    \"Oh, Mr. Jay, this is terrible news! Whatever am I to do?\" cried Paddy,  all the time keeping right on at work cutting another tree.    \"There's nothing you can do,\" replied Sammy, grinning wickedly at  Paddy's fright. \"There's nothing you can do unless you go right straight  back to the North where you came from. You think you are very smart  but--\"    Sammy didn't finish. Crack! Over fell the tree Paddy had been cutting  and the top of it fell straight into the alder in which Sammy was  sitting. \"Oh! Oh! Help!\" shrieked Sammy, spreading his wings and flying  away just in time.    Paddy sat down and laughed until his sides ached. \"Come make me another  call some day, Sammy!\" he said. \"And when you do, please bring some real  news. I know all about Old Man Coyote. You can tell him for me that when  he is planning to catch people he should be careful not to leave  footprints to give himself away.\"    Sammy didn't reply. He just sneaked off through the Green Forest,  looking quite as foolish as he felt.          XVI    OLD MAN COYOTE IS VERY CRAFTY      Coyote has a crafty brain;    His wits are sharp his ends to gain.      There is nothing in the world more true than that. Old Man Coyote has  the craftiest brain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#6)"],[1," Child Jesus,\" says Thomas of  Celano, \"had been given over to forgetfulness in the hearts of many in  whom, by the working of His grace, He was raised up again through His  servant Francis.\"{10}    To the Early Middle Ages Christ was the awful Judge, the _Rex tremendae  majestatis_, though also the divine bringer of salvation from sin and  eternal punishment, and, to the mystic, the Bridegroom of the Soul. To  Francis He was the little brother of all mankind as well. It was a new  human joy that came into religion with him. His essentially artistic  nature was the first to realize the full poetry of Christmas--the coming  of infinity into extremest limitation, the Highest made the lowliest, the  King of all kings a poor infant. He had, in a supreme degree, the mingled  reverence and tenderness that inspire the best carols.    Though no Christmas verses by St. Francis have come down to us, there is  a beautiful \"psalm\" for Christmas Day at Vespers, composed by him partly  from passages of Scripture. A portion of Father Paschal Robinson's  translation may be quoted:--       \"Rejoice to God our helper.      Shout unto God, living and true,      With the voice of triumph.      For the Lord is high, terrible:      A great King over all the earth.      For the most holy Father of heaven, |39|      Our King, before ages sent His Beloved        Son from on high, and He        was born of the Blessed Virgin,        holy Mary.           *       *       *       *       *       This is the day which the Lord        hath made: let us rejoice and be glad in it.      For the beloved and most holy      Child has been given to us and        born for us by the wayside.      And laid in a manger because He        had no room in the inn.      Glory to God in the highest: and        on earth peace to men of good will.\"{11}    [Illustration:    JACOPONE IN ECSTASY BEFORE THE VIRGIN.    From \"Laude di Frate Jacopone da Todi\"    (Florence, 1490).]    It is in the poetry of Jacopone da Todi, born shortly after the death of  St. Francis, that the Franciscan Christmas spirit finds its most intense  expression. A wild, wandering ascetic, an impassioned poet, and a soaring  mystic, Jacopone is one of the greatest of Christian singers, unpolished  as his verses are. Noble by birth, he made himself utterly as the common  people for whom he piped his rustic notes. \"Dio fatto piccino\" (\"God made  a little thing\") is the keynote of his music; the Christ Child is for him  \"our sweet little brother\"; with tender affection he rejoices in  endearing diminutives--\"Bambolino,\" \"Piccolino,\" \"Jesulino.\" He sings of  the Nativity with extraordinary realism.[13] Here, in words, is a picture  of the Madonna and her Child that might well have inspired an early  Tuscan artist:--       \"Veggiamo il suo Bambino      Gammettare nel fieno,      E le braccia scoperte      Porgere ad ella in seno, |40|      Ed essa lo ricopre      El meglio che puo almeno,      Mettendoli la poppa      Entro la sua bocchina.           *       *       *       *       *        A la sua man manca,      Cullava lo Bambino,      E con sante carole      Nenciava il suo amor fino....      Gli Angioletti d' intorno      Se ne gian danzando,      Facendo dolci versi      E d' amor favellando.\"[14]{12}    But there is an intense sense of the divine, as well as the human, in the  Holy Babe; no one has felt more vividly the paradox of the Incarnation:--       \"Ne la degna stalla del dolce Bambino      Gli Angeli cantano d' intorno al piccolino;        Cantano e gridano gli Angeli diletti,      Tutti riverenti timidi e subietti, |41|      Al Bambolino principe de gli eletti,      Che nudo giace nel pungente spino.           *       *       *       *       *          Il Verbo divino, che e sommo sapiente,      In questo di par che non sappia niente,      Guardal su' l fieno, che gambetta piangente,      Como elli non fusse huomo divino.\"[15]{13}    Here, again, are some sweet and homely lines about preparation for the  Infant Saviour:--          \"Andiamo a lavare      La casa a nettare,      Che non trovi bruttura.        Poi el menaremo,      Et gli daremo      Ben da ber' e mangiare.        Un cibo espiato,      Et d' or li sia dato      Senza alcuna dimura.        Lo cor adempito      Dagiamoli fornito      Senza odio ne rancura.\"[16]{14}    |42| There have been few more rapturous poets than Jacopone; men deemed  him mad; but, \"if he is mad,\" says a modern Italian writer, \"he is mad as  the lark\"--\"Nessun poeta canta a tutta gola come questo frate minore. S'  e pazzo, e pazzo come l' allodola.\"    To him is attributed that most poignant of Latin hymns, the \"Stabat Mater  dolorosa\"; he wrote also a joyous Christmas pendant to it:--       \"Stabat Mater speciosa,      Juxta foenum gaudiosa,        Dum jacebat parvulus.      Cujus animam gaudentem,      Laetabundam ac ferventem,        Pertransivit jubilus.\"[17]{15}    In the fourteenth century we find a blossoming forth of Christmas poetry  in another land, Germany.{16} There are indeed Christmas and Epiphany  passages in a poetical Life of Christ by Otfrid of Weissenburg in the  ninth century, and a twelfth-century poem by Spervogel, \"Er ist gewaltic  unde starc,\" opens with a mention of Christmas, but these are of little  importance for us. The fourteenth century shows the first real outburst,  and that is traceable, in part at least, to the mystical movement in the  Rhineland caused by the preaching of the great Dominican, Eckhart of  Strasburg, and his followers. It was a movement towards inward piety as  distinguished from, though not excluding, external observances, which  made its way largely by sermons listened to by great congregations in the  towns. Its impulse came not from the monasteries proper, but from the  convents of Dominican friars, and it was for Germany in the fourteenth  century something like what Franciscanism had been for Italy in the  thirteenth. One of the central doctrines of the school |43| was that of  the Divine Birth in the soul of the believer; according to Eckhart the  soul comes into immediate union with God by \"bringing forth the Son\"  within itself; the historic Christ is the symbol of the divine humanity  to which the soul should rise: \"when the soul bringeth forth the Son,\" he  says, \"it is happier than Mary.\"{17} Several Christmas sermons by  Eckhart have been preserved; one of them ends with the prayer, \"To this  Birth may that God, who to-day is new born as man, bring us, that we,  poor children of earth, may be born in Him as God; to this may He bring  us eternally! Amen.\"{18} With this profound doctrine of the Divine  Birth, it was natural that the German mystics should enter deeply into  the festival of Christmas, and one of the earliest of German Christmas  carols, \"Es komt ein schif geladen,\" is the work of Eckhart's disciple,  John Tauler (d. 1361). It is perhaps an adaptation of a secular song:--       \"A ship comes sailing onwards        With a precious freight on board;      It bears the only Son of God,        It bears the Eternal Word.\"    The doctrine of the mystics, \"Die in order to live,\" fills the last  verses:--       \"Whoe'er would hope in gladness        To kiss this Holy Child,      Must suffer many a pain and woe,        Patient like Him and mild;        Must die with Him to evil        And rise to righteousness,      That so with Christ he too may share        Eternal life and bliss.\"{19}    To the fourteenth century may perhaps belong an allegorical carol still  sung in both Catholic and Protestant Germany:--       \"Es ist ein Ros entsprungen      Aus einer Wurzel zart, |44|      Als uns die Alten sungen,      Von Jesse kam die Art,      Und hat ein Bluemlein bracht,      Mitten im kalten Winter,      Wohl zu der halben Nacht.      Das Roeslein, das ich meine,      Davon Jesajas sagt,      Hat uns gebracht alleine      Marie, die reine Magd.      Aus Gottes ew'gem Rat      Hat sie ein Kind geboren      Wohl zu der halben Nacht.\"[18]{20}    In a fourteenth-century Life of the mystic Heinrich Suso it is told how  one day angels came to him to comfort him in his sufferings, how they  took him by the hand and led him to dance, while one began a glad song of  the child Jesus, \"In dulci jubilo.\" To the fourteenth century, then,  dates back that most delightful of German carols, with its interwoven  lines of Latin. I may quote the fine Scots translation in the \"Godlie and  Spirituall Sangis\" of 1567:--       \"_In dulci Jubilo_, Now lat us sing with myrth and jo      Our hartis consolatioun lyis _in praesepio_,      And schynis as the Sone, _Matris in gremio_,      _Alpha es et O, Alpha es et O._      _O Jesu parvule!_ I thrist sore efter the, |45|      Confort my hart and mynde, _O puer optime_,      God of all grace sa kynde, _et princeps gloriae_      _Trahe me post te, Trahe me post te_.      _Ubi sunt gaudia_, in ony place bot thair,      Quhair that the Angellis sing _Nova cantica_,      Bot and the bellis ring _in regis curia_,      God gif I war thair, God gif I war thair.\"{21}    The music of \"In dulci jubilo\"[19] has, with all its religious feeling,  something of the nature of a dance, and unites in a strange fashion  solemnity, playfulness, and ecstatic delight. No other air, perhaps,  shows so perfectly the reverent gaiety of the carol spirit.    The fifteenth century produced a realistic type of German carol. Here is  the beginning of one such:--       \"Da Jesu Krist geboren wart,      do was es kalt;      in ain klaines kripplein      er geleget wart.      Da stunt ain esel und ain rint,      die atmizten ueber das hailig kint      gar unverborgen.      Der ain raines herze hat, der darf nit sorgen.\"[20]{22}    It goes on to tell in naive language the story of the wanderings of the  Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt.    This carol type lasted, and continued to develop, in Austria and the  Catholic parts of Germany through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and"]]]
