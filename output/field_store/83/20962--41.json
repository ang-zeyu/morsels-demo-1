Moscow, October 7, (20,) 1914.          How Prohibition Came to Russia    Interview with the Peasant-Born Millionaire Reformer, Tchelisheff.    [By the Associated Press.]      PETROGRAD, Nov. 18.--There is prohibition in Russia today, prohibition  which means that not a drop of vodka, whisky, brandy, gin, or any other  strong liquor is obtainable from one end to the other of a territory  populated by 130,000,000 people and covering one-sixth of the habitable  globe.    The story of how strong drink has been utterly banished from the Russian  Empire was related by Michael Demitrovitch Tchelisheff, the man directly  responsible for putting an end to Russia's great vice, the vodka habit.    It should be said in the beginning that the word prohibition in Russia  must be taken literally. Its use does not imply a partially successful  attempt to curtail the consumption of liquor resulting in drinking in  secret places, the abuse of medical licenses and general evasion and  subterfuge. It does mean that a vast population who consumed  $1,000,000,000 worth of vodka a year; whose ordinary condition has been  described by Russians themselves as ranging from a slight degree of  stimulation upward, has been lifted almost in one day from a drunken  inertia to sobriety.    On that day when the mobilization of the Russian Army began, special  policemen visited every public place where vodka is sold, locked up the  supply of the liquor, and placed on the shop the imperial seal. Since  the manufacture and sale of vodka is a Government monopoly in Russia, it  is not a difficult thing to enforce prohibition.    From the day this step was taken drunkenness vanished in Russia. The  results are seen at once in the peasantry; already they are beginning to  look like a different race. The marks of suffering, the pinched looks of  illness and improper nourishment have gone from their faces. There has  been also a remarkable change in the appearance of their clothes. Their  clothes are cleaner, and both the men and women appear more neatly and  better dressed. The destitute character of the homes of the poor has  been replaced with something like order and thrift.    In Petrograd and Moscow the effect of these improved conditions is  fairly startling. On holidays in these two cities inebriates always  filled the police stations and often lay about on the sidewalks and even  in the streets. Things are so different today that unattended women may  now pass at night through portions of these cities where it was formerly  dangerous even for men. Minor crimes and misdemeanors have almost  vanished.    Tchelisheff, the man who virtually accomplished this miracle, was a  peasant by birth, originally a house painter by profession, then Mayor  of the city of Samara, and now a millionaire. Physically he is a giant,  standing over 6 feet 4 inches in his stocking feet, and of powerful  build. Although he is 55 years old, he looks much younger. His movements  display the energy of youth, his eyes are animated, and his black hair  is not tinged by gray.    In Petrograd Mr. Tchelisheff is generally found in a luxurious suite of  rooms in one of the best hotels. He goes about clad in a blue blouse  with a tasseled girdle, and baggy black breeches tucked into heavy  boots. He offers his visitors tea from a samovar and fruit from the  Crimea. Speaking of what he had accomplished for the cause of sobriety  in Russia, Mr. Tchelisheff said:    \"I was reared in a small Russian village. There were no schools or  hospitals, or any of the improvements we are accustomed to in civilized  communities. I picked up an education from old newspapers and stray  books. One day I chanced upon a book in the hands of a moujik, which  treated of the harmfulness of alcohol. It stated among other things that  vodka was a poison.    \"I was so impressed with this, knowing that everybody drank vodka, that  I asked the first physician I met if the statement were true. He said  yes. Men drank it, he explained, because momentarily it gave them a  sensation of pleasant dizziness. From that time I decided to take every  opportunity to discover more about the use of vodka.    \"At the end of the eighties there came famine in Russia, followed by  agrarian troubles. I saw a crowd of peasants demand from a local  landlord all the grain and foodstuffs in his granary. This puzzled me; I  could not understand how honest men were indulging in what seemed to be  highway robbery. But I noted at the time that every man who was taking  part in this incident was a drinking man, while their fellow villagers,  who were abstemious, had sufficient provisions in their own homes. Thus  it was that I observed the industrial effects of vodka drinking.    \"At Samara I decided to do more than passively disapprove of vodka. At  this time I was an Alderman, and many of the tenants living in my houses  were workingmen. One night a drunken father in one of my houses killed  his wife. This incident made such a terrible impression on me that I  decided to fight vodka with all my strength.    \"On the supposition that the Government was selling vodka for the  revenue, I calculated the revenue received from its consumption in  Samara. I then introduced a bill in the City Council providing that the  city give this sum of money to the imperial treasury, requesting at the  same time that the sale of vodka be prohibited. This bill passed, and  the money was appropriated. It was offered to the Government, but the  Government promptly refused it.    \"It then dawned upon me that Russian bureaucracy did not want the people  to become sober, for the reason that it was easier to rule  autocratically a drunken mob than a sober people.    \"This was seven years ago. Later I was elected Mayor of Samara, capital  of the Volga district, a district with over a quarter of a million  inhabitants. Subsequently I was elected to the Duma on an anti-vodka  platform. In the Duma I proposed a bill permitting the inhabitants of  any town to close the local vodka shops, and providing also that every  bottle of vodka should bear a label with the word poison. At my request  the wording of this label, in which the evils of vodka were set forth,  was done by the late Count Leo Tolstoy. This bill passed the Duma and  went to the Imperial Council, where it was amended and finally tabled.    \"I then begged an audience of Emperor Nicholas. He received me with  great kindness in his castle in the Crimea, not far from the scene of  the recent Turkish bombardment. He listened to me patiently. He was  impressed with my recital that most of the revolutionary and Socialist  excesses were committed by drunkards, and that the Svesborg, Kronstadt,  and Sebastopol navy revolts and the Petrograd and other mutinous  military movements were all caused by inebriates. Having heard me out  his Majesty promised at once to speak to his Minister of Finance  concerning the prohibition of vodka.    \"Disappointed at not having been able to get through a Government bill  regulating this evil, I had abandoned my seat in the Duma. It was  evident that the bureaucracy had been able to obstruct the measure.  Minister of Finance Kokovsoff regarded it as a dangerous innovation,  depriving the Government of 1,000,000,000 rubles ($500,000,000) yearly,  without any method of replacing this revenue.    \"While I lobbied in Petrograd the Emperor visited the country around  Moscow and saw the havoc of vodka. He then dismissed Kokovsoff, and  appointed the present Minister of Finance, M. Bark.    \"Mobilization precipitated the anti-vodka measure. The Grand Duke,  remembering the disorganization due to drunkenness during the  mobilization of 1904, ordered the prohibition of all alcoholic drinks  except in clubs and first-class restaurants. This order, enforced for  one month, showed the Russian authorities the value of abstinence.    \"In spite of the general depression caused by the war, the paralysis of  business, the closing of factories, and the interruption of railroad  traffic, the people felt no depression. Savings banks showed an increase  in deposits over the preceding month, and over the corresponding month  of the preceding year. At the same there was a boom in the sale of  meats, groceries, clothing, dry goods, and housefurnishings. The  30,000,000 rubles a day that had been paid for vodka were now being  spent for the necessities of life.    \"The average working week increased from three and four days to six, the  numerous holiday [Transcriber's Note: so in original] of the drinker  having been eliminated. The working day also became longer, and the  efficiency of the worker was perhaps doubled. Women and children, who  seldom were without marks showing the physical violence of the husband  and father, suddenly found themselves in an undreamed-of paradise.  There were no blows, no insults, and no rough treatment. There was bread  on the table, milk for the babies, and a fire in the kitchen.    \"I decided to seize this occasion for a press campaign, so far as this  is a possible thing in Russia. I organized delegations to present  petitions to the proper authorities for the prolonging of this new  sobriety for the duration of the war. This step found favor with his  Imperial Majesty, and an order was issued to that effect. Another  similar campaign to remove the licenses from privileged restaurants and  clubs was successful, and strong liquor is no longer available anywhere  in Russia.    \"The second month of abstinence made the manifold advantages so clear to  everybody that when we called"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#6)"],[1,"stones in its shallow course, or crept round big grey boulders that were  wrapped in thick mosses, in which were mingled flowers of the pink and  red wild fuchsia, or the creamy great blossoms of the rock lily. Dot ran  down the stream with bare feet, laughing as she paddled in and out among  the rocks and ferns, and the sun shone down on the gleaming foam of the  water, and made golden lights in Dot's wild curls. The Kangaroo, too,  was very merry, and bounded from rock to rock over the stream, showing  what wonderful things she could do in that way; and sometimes they  paused, side by side, and peeped down upon some still pool that showed  their two reflections as in a mirror; and that seemed so funny to Dot,  that her silvery laugh woke the silence in happy peals, until more  green-and-red Parrakeets flew out of the bush to join in the fun.    [Illustration: DOT AND THE KANGAROO ON THEIR WAY TO THE PLATYPUS]    When they had followed the stream some distance, the gully opened out  into bush scrub. The little Parrakeets then said \"Good-bye,\" and flew  back to their favourite tree-ferns and bush growth; and the Kangaroo  said, that as they were nearing the home of the Platypus, they must not  play in the stream any more; to do so might warn the creature of their  approach and frighten it. \"We shall have to be very careful,\" she said,  \"so that the Platypus will neither hear nor smell you. We will therefore  walk on the opposite shore, as the wind will then blow away from its  home.\"    The stream no longer chattered over rocky beds, but slid between soft  banks of earth, under tufts of tall rushes, grasses, and ferns, and soon  it opened into a broad pool, which was smooth as glass. The clouds in  the sky, the tall surrounding trees, and the graceful ferns and rushes  of the banks, were all reflected in the water, so that it looked to Dot  like a strange upside-down picture. This, then, was the home of that  wonderful animal; and Dot felt quite frightened, because she thought she  was going to see something terrible.    At the Kangaroo's bidding, she hid a little way from the edge of the  pool, but she was able to see all that happened.    The Kangaroo evidently did not enjoy the prospect of conversing with the  Platypus. She kept on fidgetting about, putting off calling to the  Platypus by one excuse and another: she was decidedly ill at ease.    \"Are you frightened of the Platypus?\" asked Dot.    \"Dear me, no!\" replied the Kangaroo, \"but I'd rather have a talk with  any other bush creature. First of all, the sight of it makes me so  uncomfortable, that I want to hop away the instant I set eyes upon it.  Then, too, it's so difficult to be polite to the Platypus, because one  never knows how to behave towards it. If you treat it as an animal, you  offend its bird nature, and if you treat it as a bird, the animal in it  is mighty indignant. One never knows where one is with a creature that  is two creatures,\" said the Kangaroo.    Dot was so sorry for the perplexity of her friend, that she suggested  that they should not consult the Platypus. But the Kangaroo said it must  be done, because no one in the bush was so learned. Being such a strange  creature, and living in such seclusion, and being so difficult to  approach, was a proof that it was the right adviser to seek. So, with a  half desperate air, the Kangaroo left the little girl, and went down to  the water's edge.    Pausing a moment, she made a strange little noise that was something  between a grunt and a hiss: and she repeated this many times. At last  Dot saw what looked like a bit of black stick, just above the surface of  the pool, coming towards their side, and, as it moved forward, leaving  two little silvery ripples that widened out behind it on the smooth  waters. Presently the black stick, which was the bill of the Platypus,  reached the bank, and the strangest little creature climbed into view.  Dot had expected to see something big and hideous; but here was quite a  small object after all! It seemed quite ridiculous that the great  Kangaroo should be evidently discomposed by the sight.    Dot could not hear what the Kangaroo said, but she saw the Platypus  hurriedly prepare to regain the water. It began to stumble clumsily down  the bank. The Kangaroo then raised her voice in pleading accents.    \"But,\" she said, \"it's such a little Human! I have treated it like my  baby kangaroo, and have carried it in my pouch.\"    This information seemed to arrest the movements of the Platypus; it had  reached the water's edge, but it paused, and turned.    \"I tell you,\" it said in a high-pitched and irritable voice, \"that all  Humans are alike! They all come here to interview me for the same  purpose, and I'm resolved it shall not happen again; I have been  insulted enough by their ignorance.\"    \"I assure you,\" urged the Kangaroo, \"that she will not annoy you in that  way. She wouldn't think of doing such a thing to any animal.\"    As the Kangaroo called the Platypus an animal, Dot saw at once that it  was offended, and in a great huff it turned towards the pool again. \"I  beg your pardon,\" said the Kangaroo nervously. \"I didn't mean an  altogether animal, or even a bird, but any a--a--a--.\" She seemed  puzzled how to speak of the Platypus, when the strange creature, seeing  the well-meaning embarrassment of the Kangaroo, said affably, \"any  mammal or Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus.\"    \"Exactly,\" said the Kangaroo, brightening up, although she hadn't the  least idea what a mammal was.    \"Well, bring the little Human here,\" said the Platypus in a more  friendly tone, \"and if I feel quite sure on that point I will permit an  interview.\"    Two bounds brought the Kangaroo to where Dot was hidden. She seemed  anxious that the child should make a good impression on the Platypus,  and tried with the long claws on her little black hands to comb through  Dot's long gleaming curls; but they were so tangled that the child  called out at this awkward method of hairdressing, and the Kangaroo  stopped. She then licked a black smudge off Dot's forehead, which was  all she could do to tidy her. Then she started back a hop, and eyed the  child with her head on one side. She was not quite satisfied. \"Ah!\" she  said, \"if only you were a baby kangaroo I could make you look so nice!  but I can't do anything to your sham coat, which gets worse every day,  and your fur is all wrong, for one can't get one's claws through it. You  Humans are no good in the bush!\"    \"Never mind, dear Kangaroo,\" said the little girl; \"when I get home  mother will put me on a new frock, and will get the tangles out of my  hair. Let us go to the Platypus now.\"    The Kangaroo felt sad as Dot spoke of returning home, for she had become  really fond of the little Human. She began to feel that she would be  lonely when they parted. However, she did not speak of what was in her  mind, but bounded back to the Platypus to wait for Dot.    When the little girl reached the pool, she was still more surprised, on  a nearer view of the Platypus, that the Kangaroo should think so much of  it. At her feet she beheld a creature like a shapeless bit of wet matted  fur. She thought it looked like an empty fur bag that had been fished  out of the water. Projecting from the head, that seemed much nearer to  the ground than the back, was a broad duck's bill, of a dirty grey  colour; and peeping out underneath were two fore feet that were like a  duck's also. Altogether it was such a funny object that she was inclined  to laugh, only the Kangaroo looked so serious, that she tried to look  serious too, as if there was nothing strange in the appearance of the  Platypus.    \"I am the Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus!\" said the Platypus pompously.    \"I am Dot,\" said the little girl.    \"Now we know one another's names,\" said the Platypus, with satisfaction.  \"If the Kangaroo had introduced us, it would have stumbled over my name,  and mumbled yours, and we should have been none the wiser. Now tell me,  little Human, are you going to write a book about me? because if you  are, I'm off. I can't stand any more books being written about me; I've  been annoyed enough that way.\"    \"I couldn't write a book,\" said Dot, with surprise; inwardly wondering  what anyone could find to make a book of, out of such a small, ugly  creature.    \"You're quite sure?\" asked the Platypus, doubtfully, and evidently more  than half inclined to dive into the pool.    \"Quite,\" said Dot.    \"Then I'll try to believe you,\" said the Platypus, clumsily waddling  towards some grass, amongst which it settled itself comfortably. \"But  it's very difficult to believe you Humans, for you tell such dreadful  fibs,\" it continued, as it squirted some dirty water out of the bag that  surrounded its bill, and swallowed some water beetles, small snails and  mud that it had stored there. \"See, for instance, the way you have all  quarrelled and lied about me! One great Human, the biggest fool of all,  said I wasn't a live creature at all, but a joke another Human had  played upon him. Then they squabbled together--one saying I was a  Beaver; another that I was a Duck; another, that I was a Mole, or a Rat.  Then they argued whether I was a bird, or an animal, or if we laid eggs,  or not; and everyone wrote a book, full of lies, all out of his head.    \"That's the way Humans amuse themselves. They write books about things  they don't understand, and each new book says all the others are all  wrong. It's a silly game, and very insulting to the creatures they write  about. Humans at the other end of the world, who never took the trouble  to come here to see me, wrote books about me. Those who did come were  more impudent than those who stayed away. Their idea of learning all  about a creature was to dig up its home, and frighten it out of its  wits, and kill it; and after a few moons of that sort of foolery they  claimed to know all about us.
