RIZER      Smithsonian Institution,        Bureau of Ethnology,            Washington, _November 24, 1891_.      Honorable J. W. Powell,        _Director of the Bureau of Ethnology_.      Sir: Complying with your order directing me to proceed to Florence,    Arizona, to witness the closing up of the work under contract for    the preservation of Casa Grande ruin near that place, and to report    to you the amount and character of the work accomplished, certifying    the amount due the contractors under each item, I have the honor to    submit the following report:      I visited the ruin first on October 20, and found the work well    advanced. Steady progress was made from said date until October 31,    the limitation expressed in the contract for prosecuting it.      In order to ascertain the exact location of Casa Grande ruin and to    aid me in the determination of the amount of work performed by the    contractors, I employed Mr Albert T. Colton, a civil engineer and    the official surveyor of Pinal county, Arizona, within the limits of    which the ruin stands. From actual measurements made by Mr Colton,    based upon official notes in his custody, he informed me the ruin    was located in the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of the    southwest quarter of section 16 of township 5 south, range 8 east. A    congressional township plat on which Mr Colton has marked the exact    location of the ruin is filed herewith, marked Exhibit A, and made a    part of this report [plate CXXV].      On October 29 Mr Colton at my instance took measurements of the    brickwork in underpinning and filling in cavities in the walls and    of the excavation done by the contractors. His estimate, based upon    these measurements, was submitted to me in writing. It is filed    herewith, marked Exhibit B, and is made a part of this report.      I find from these measurements that the contractors excavated and    removed to a point 100 yards from the ruin 570 cubic yards of    debris, 271 cubic yards of which were removed from the interior and    299 cubic yards from the exterior walls of the building, within an    area of 10 feet of said walls.      I also find the amount of underpinning done by the contractors to be    919 cubic feet, and the amount of filling in openings to be 1,161    cubic feet. The underpinning is done with hard-burned brick laid in    good cement mortar extending to a depth of 12 inches below the    original ground level. The face of the brickwork is set back from 1    to 2 inches from the face of the wall and plastered with a coat of    good cement mortar, making it flush with the outer wall.      In filling in cavities more than 500 lineal feet of 2 by 4 inch    squared lumber was used to replace broken-out lintels and laid side    by side across nearly the whole "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],[0,"The Phantom of the Opera (#6)"],[1,"the same ceremony on the floor above, in the foyer of the  singers, and that finally they were themselves to receive their  personal friends, for the last time, in the great lobby outside the  managers' office, where a regular supper would be served.    Here they found the new managers, M. Armand Moncharmin and M. Firmin  Richard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were lavish in  protestations of friendship and received a thousand flattering  compliments in reply, so that those of the guests who had feared that  they had a rather tedious evening in store for them at once put on  brighter faces.  The supper was almost gay and a particularly clever  speech of the representative of the government, mingling the glories of  the past with the successes of the future, caused the greatest  cordiality to prevail.    The retiring managers had already handed over to their successors the  two tiny master-keys which opened all the doors--thousands of doors--of  the Opera house.  And those little keys, the object of general  curiosity, were being passed from hand to hand, when the attention of  some of the guests was diverted by their discovery, at the end of the  table, of that strange, wan and fantastic face, with the hollow eyes,  which had already appeared in the foyer of the ballet and been greeted  by little Jammes' exclamation:    \"The Opera ghost!\"    There sat the ghost, as natural as could be, except that he neither ate  nor drank.  Those who began by looking at him with a smile ended by  turning away their heads, for the sight of him at once provoked the  most funereal thoughts.  No one repeated the joke of the foyer, no one  exclaimed:    \"There's the Opera ghost!\"    He himself did not speak a word and his very neighbors could not have  stated at what precise moment he had sat down between them; but every  one felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the table of the  living, they could not cut a more ghastly figure.  The friends of  Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin thought that this lean and skinny  guest was an acquaintance of Debienne's or Poligny's, while Debienne's  and Poligny's friends believed that the cadaverous individual belonged  to Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin's party.    The result was that no request was made for an explanation; no  unpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have offended this  visitor from the tomb.  A few of those present who knew the story of  the ghost and the description of him given by the chief  scene-shifter--they did not know of Joseph Buquet's death--thought, in  their own minds, that the man at the end of the table might easily have  passed for him; and yet, according to the story, the ghost had no nose  and the person in question had.  But M. Moncharmin declares, in his  Memoirs, that the guest's nose was transparent:  \"long, thin and  transparent\" are his exact words.  I, for my part, will add that this  might very well apply to a false nose.  M. Moncharmin may have taken  for transparency what was only shininess.  Everybody knows that  orthopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for those who have  lost their noses naturally or as the result of an operation.    Did the ghost really take a seat at the managers' supper-table that  night, uninvited?  And can we be sure that the figure was that of the  Opera ghost himself?  Who would venture to assert as much?  I mention  the incident, not because I wish for a second to make the reader  believe--or even to try to make him believe--that the ghost was capable  of such a sublime piece of impudence; but because, after all, the thing  is impossible.    M. Armand Moncharmin, in chapter eleven of his Memoirs, says:    \"When I think of this first evening, I can not separate the secret  confided to us by MM. Debienne and Poligny in their office from the  presence at our supper of that GHOSTLY person whom none of us knew.\"    What happened was this:  Mm. Debienne and Poligny, sitting at the  center of the table, had not seen the man with the death's head.  Suddenly he began to speak.    \"The ballet-girls are right,\" he said.  \"The death of that poor Buquet  is perhaps not so natural as people think.\"    Debienne and Poligny gave a start.    \"Is Buquet dead?\" they cried.    \"Yes,\" replied the man, or the shadow of a man, quietly.  \"He was  found, this evening, hanging in the third cellar, between a farm-house  and a scene from the Roi de Lahore.\"    The two managers, or rather ex-managers, at once rose and stared  strangely at the speaker.  They were more excited than they need have  been, that is to say, more excited than any one need be by the  announcement of the suicide of a chief scene-shifter. They looked at  each other.  They, had both turned whiter than the table-cloth.  At  last, Debienne made a sign to Mm. Richard and Moncharmin; Poligny  muttered a few words of excuse to the guests; and all four went into  the managers' office.  I leave M. Moncharmin to complete the story.  In  his Memoirs, he says:    \"Mm. Debienne and Poligny seemed to grow more and more excited, and  they appeared to have something very difficult to tell us.  First, they  asked us if we knew the man, sitting at the end of the table, who had  told them of the death of Joseph Buquet; and, when we answered in the  negative, they looked still more concerned.  They took the master-keys  from our hands, stared at them for a moment and advised us to have new  locks made, with the greatest secrecy, for the rooms, closets and  presses that we might wish to have hermetically closed.  They said this  so funnily that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thieves at  the Opera.  They replied that there was something worse, which was the  GHOST.  We began to laugh again, feeling sure that they were indulging  in some joke that was intended to crown our little entertainment.  Then, at their request, we became 'serious,' resolving to humor them  and to enter into the spirit of the game.  They told us that they never  would have spoken to us of the ghost, if they had not received formal  orders from the ghost himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to  grant any request that he might make.  However, in their relief at  leaving a domain where that tyrannical shade held sway, they had  hesitated until the last moment to tell us this curious story, which  our skeptical minds were certainly not prepared to entertain.  But the  announcement of the death of Joseph Buquet had served them as a brutal  reminder that, whenever they had disregarded the ghost's wishes, some  fantastic or disastrous event had brought them to a sense of their  dependence.    \"During these unexpected utterances made in a tone of the most secret  and important confidence, I looked at Richard.  Richard, in his student  days, had acquired a great reputation for practical joking, and he  seemed to relish the dish which was being served up to him in his turn.  He did not miss a morsel of it, though the seasoning was a little  gruesome because of the death of Buquet.  He nodded his head sadly,  while the others spoke, and his features assumed the air of a man who  bitterly regretted having taken over the Opera, now that he knew that  there was a ghost mixed up in the business.  I could think of nothing  better than to give him a servile imitation of this attitude of  despair.  However, in spite of all our efforts, we could not, at the  finish, help bursting out laughing in the faces of MM. Debienne and  Poligny, who, seeing us pass straight from the gloomiest state of mind  to one of the most insolent merriment, acted as though they thought  that we had gone mad.    \"The joke became a little tedious; and Richard asked half-seriously and  half in jest:    \"'But, after all, what does this ghost of yours want?'    \"M. Poligny went to his desk and returned with a copy of the  memorandum-book. The memorandum-book begins with the well-known words  saying that 'the management of the Opera shall give to the performance  of the National Academy of Music the splendor that becomes the first  lyric stage in France' and ends with Clause 98, which says that the  privilege can be withdrawn if the manager infringes the conditions  stipulated in the memorandum-book.  This is followed by the conditions,  which are four in number.    \"The copy produced by M. Poligny was written in black ink and exactly  similar to that in our possession, except that, at the end, it  contained a paragraph in red ink and in a queer, labored handwriting,  as though it had been produced by dipping the heads of matches into the  ink, the writing of a child that has never got beyond the down-strokes  and has not learned to join its letters.  This paragraph ran, word for  word, as follows:    \"'5. Or if the manager, in any month, delay for more than a fortnight  the payment of the allowance which he shall make to the Opera ghost, an  allowance of twenty thousand francs a month, say two hundred and forty  thousand francs a year.'    \"M. Poligny pointed with a hesitating finger to this last clause, which  we certainly did not expect.    \"'Is this all?  Does he not want anything else?' asked Richard, with  the greatest coolness.    \"'Yes, he does,' replied Poligny.    \"And he turned over the pages of the memorandum-book until he came to  the clause specifying the days on which certain private boxes were to  be reserved for the free use of the president of the republic, the  ministers and so on.  At the end of this clause, a line had been added,  also in red ink:    \"'Box Five on the grand tier shall be placed at the disposal of the  Opera ghost for every performance.'    \"When we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to rise from  our chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the hand and  congratulate them on thinking of this charming little joke, which  proved that the old French sense of humor was never likely to become  extinct.  Richard added that he now understood why MM."]]]
