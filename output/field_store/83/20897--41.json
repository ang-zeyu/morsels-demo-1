It is also an interesting fact that the poets and thinkers of the age  were Handel's firm admirers. Such men as Gay, Arbuthnot, Hughes, Colley  Cibber, Pope, Fielding, Hogarth, and Smollett, who recognized the deep,  struggling tendencies of the times, measured Handel truly. They defended  him in print, and never failed to attend his performances, and at  his benefit concerts their enthusiastic support always insured him an  overflowing house.    The popular instinct was also true to him. The aristocratic classes  sneered at his oratorios and complained at his innovations. His music  was found to be good bait for the popular gardens and the holiday-makers  of the period. Jonathan Tyers was one of the most liberal managers  of this class. He was proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens, and Handel  (_incognito_) supplied him with nearly all his music. The composer did  much the same sort of thing for Marylebone Gardens, furbishing up old  and writing new strains with an ease that well became the urgency of the  circumstances.    \"My grandfather,\" says the Rev. J. Fountagne, \"as I have been told, was  an enthusiast in music, and cultivated most of all the friendship of  musical men, especially of Handel, who visited him often, and had a  great predilection for his society. This leads me to relate an anecdote  which I have on the best authority. While Marylebone Gardens were  flourishing, the enchanting music of Handel, and probably of Arne, was  often heard from the orchestra there. One evening, as my grandfather and  Handel were walking together and alone, a new piece was struck up by the  band. 'Come, Mr. Fountagne,' said Handel, 'let us sit down and listen  to this piece; I want to know your opinion about it.' Down they sat, and  after some time the old parson, turning to his companion, said, 'It  is not worth listening to; it's very poor stuff.' 'You are right, Mr.  Fountagne,' said Handel, 'it is very poor stuff; I thought so myself  when I had finished it.' The old gentleman, being taken by surprise, was  beginning to apologize; but Handel assured him there was no necessity,  that the music was really bad, having been composed hastily, and his  time for the production limited; and that the opinion given was as  correct as it was honest.\"      VI.    The period of Handel's highest development had now arrived. For seven  years his genius had been slowly but surely maturing, in obedience  to the inner law of his being. He had struggled long in the bonds of  operatic composition, but even here his innovations showed conclusively  how he was reaching out toward the form with which his name was to  be associated through all time. The year 1739 was one of prodigious  activity. The oratorio of \"Saul\" was produced, of which the \"Dead March\"  is still recognized as one of the great musical compositions of all  time, being one of the few intensely solemn symphonies written in a  major key. Several works now forgotten were composed, and the great  \"Israel in Egypt\" was written in the incredibly short space of  twenty-seven days. Of this work a distinguished writer on music says:  Handel was now fifty-five years old, and had entered, after many a  long and weary contest, upon his last and greatest creative period.  His genius culminates in the 'Israel.' Elsewhere he has produced longer  recitatives and more pathetic arias; nowhere has he written finer tenor  songs than 'The enemy said,' or finer duets than 'The Lord is a man of  war;' and there is not in the history of music an example of choruses  piled up like so many Ossas on Pelions in such majestic strength, and  hurled in open defiance at a public whose ears were itching for Italian  love-lays and English ballads. In these twenty-eight colossal choruses  we perceive at once a reaction against and a triumph over the tastes of  the age. The wonder is, not that the 'Israel' was unpopular, but that  it should have been tolerated; but Handel, while he appears to have been  for years driven by the public, had been, in reality, driving them. His  earliest oratorio, 'Il Trionfo del Tempo' (composed in Italy), had  but two choruses; into his operas more and more were introduced, with  disastrous consequences; but when, at the zenith of his strength, he  produced a work which consisted almost entirely of these unpopular  peculiarities, the public treated him with respect, and actually sat  out three performances in one season! In addition to these two great  oratorios, our composer produced the beautiful music to Dryden's  \"St. Caecilia Ode,\" and Milton's \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso.\"  Henceforth neither praise nor blame could turn Handel from his appointed  course. He was not yet popular with the musical _dilettanti_, but we  find no more catering to an absurd taste, no more writing of silly  operatic froth.    Our composer had always been very fond of the Irish, and, at the  invitation of the lord-lieutenant and prominent Dublin amateurs,  he crossed the channel in 1741. He was received with the greatest  enthusiasm, and his house became the resort of all the musical people in  the city of Dublin. One after another his principal works were produced  before admiring audiences in the new Music Hall in Fishamble Street. The  crush to hear the \"Allegro\" and \"Penseroso\" at the opening performances  was so great that the doors had to be closed. The papers declared there  never had been seen such a scene before in Dublin.    Handel gave twelve performances at very short intervals, comprising  all of his finest works. In these concerts the \"Acis and Galatea\" and  \"Alexander's Feast\" were the most admired; but the enthusiasm culminated  in the rendition of the \"Messiah,\" produced for the first time on April  13, 1742. The performance was a beneficiary one in aid of poor and  distressed prisoners for debt in the Marshalsea in Dublin. So, by a  remarkable coincidence, the first performance of the \"Messiah\" literally  meant deliverance to the captives. The principal singers were Mrs.  Cibber (daughter-in-law of Colley Cibber, and afterward one of the  greatest actresses of her time), Mrs. Avoglio, and Mr. Dubourg. The  town was wild with excitement. Critics, poets, fine ladies, and men of  fashion tore rhetoric to tatters in their admiration. A clergyman so  far forgot his Bible in his rapture as to exclaim to Mrs. Cibber, at  the close of one of her airs, \"Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven  thee.\" The penny-a-liners wrote that \"words were wanting to express the  exquisite delight,\" etc. And--supreme compliment of all, for Handel was  a cynical bachelor--the fine ladies consented to leave their hoops at  home for the second performance, that a couple of hundred or so extra  listeners might be accommodated. This event was the grand triumph of  Handel's life. Years of misconception, neglect, and rivalry were swept  out of mind in the intoxicating delight of that night's success.      VII.    Handel returned to London, and composed a new oratorio, \"Samson,\" for  the following Lenten season. This, together with the \"Messiah,\" heard  for the first time in London, made the stock of twelve performances.  The fashionable world ignored him altogether; the newspapers kept a  contemptuous silence; comic singers were hired to parody his noblest  airs at the great houses; and impudent Horace Walpole had the audacity  to say that he \"had hired all the goddesses from farces and singers of  roast-beef, from between the acts of both theatres, with a man with one  note in his voice, and a girl with never a one; and so they sang and  made brave hallelujahs.\"    The new field into which Handel had entered inspired his genius to  its greatest energy. His new works for the season of 1744 were the  \"Det-tingen Te Deum,\" \"Semele,\" and \"Joseph and his Brethren;\" for  the next year (he had again rented the Haymarket Theatre), \"Hercules,\"  \"Belshazzar,\" and a revival of \"Deborah.\" All these works were produced  in a style of then uncommon completeness, and the great expense he  incurred, combined with the active hostility of the fashionable world,  forced him to close his doors and suspend payment. From this time  forward Handel gave concerts whenever he chose, and depended on the  people, who so supported him by their gradually growing appreciation,  that in two years he had paid off all his debts, and in ten years had  accumulated a fortune of L10,000. The works produced during these latter  years were \"Judas Maccabaeus,\" 1747; \"Alexander,\" 1748; \"Joshua,\"  1748; \"Susannah,\" 1749; \"Solomon,\" 1749; \"Theodora,\" 1750; \"Choice of  Hercules,\" 1751; \"Jephthah,\" 1752, closing with this a stupendous series  of dramatic oratorios. While at work on the last, his eyes suffered an  attack which finally resulted in blindness.    Like Milton in the case of \"Paradise Lost,\" Handel preferred one of his  least popular oratorios, \"Theodora.\" It was a great favorite with him,  and he used to say that the chorus, \"He saw the lovely youth,\" was finer  than anything in the \"Messiah.\" The public were not of this opinion, and  he was glad to give away tickets to any professors who applied for them.  When the \"Messiah\" was again produced, two of these gentlemen who had  neglected \"Theodora\" applied for admission. \"Oh! your sarvant, meine  Herren!\" exclaimed the indignant composer. \"You are tamnable dainty!  You would not go to 'Theodora'--dere was room enough to dance dere when  dat was perform.\" When Handel heard that an enthusiast had offered to  make himself responsible for all the boxes the next time the despised  oratorio should be given--\"He is a fool,\" said he; \"the Jews will not  come to it as to 'Judas Maccabaeus,' because it is a Christian story; and  the ladies will not come, because it is a virtuous one.\"    Handel's triumph was now about to culminate in a serene and acknowledged  preeminence."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#6)"],[1," among the  musical laity. Composers seldom find difficulty in understanding each  other. They listen for beauty, and if they find it they look for the  causes which have produced it, and in apprehending beauty and  recognizing means and cause they unvolitionally rise to the plane  whence a view of the composer's purposes is clear. Having grasped the  mood of a composition and found that it is being sustained or varied  in a manner accordant with their conceptions of beauty, they occupy  themselves with another kind of differentiation altogether than the  misled disciples of the musical rhapsodists who overlook the general  design and miss the grand proclamation in their search for petty  suggestions for pictures and stories among the details of the  composition. Let musicians testify for us. In his romance, \"Ein  Gluecklicher Abend,\" Wagner says:    [Sidenote: _Wagner's axiom._]         \"That which music expresses is eternal and ideal. It does       not give voice to the passion, the love, the longing of this       or the other individual, under these or the other       circumstances, but to passion, love, longing itself.\"    Moritz Hauptmann says:    [Sidenote: _Hauptmann's._]         \"The same music will admit of the most varied verbal       expositions, and of not one of them can it be correctly said       that it is exhaustive, the right one, and contains the whole       significance of the music. This significance is contained       most definitely in the music itself. It is not music that is       ambiguous; it says the same thing to everybody; it speaks to       mankind and gives voice only to human feelings. Ambiguity       only then makes its appearance when each person attempts to       formulate in his manner the emotional impression which he       has received, when he attempts to fix and hold the ethereal       essence of music, to utter the unutterable.\"    [Sidenote: _Mendelssohn's._]    [Sidenote: _The \"Songs without Words.\"_]    Mendelssohn inculcated the same lesson in a letter which he wrote to a  young poet who had given titles to a number of the composer's \"Songs  Without Words,\" and incorporated what he conceived to be their  sentiments in a set of poems. He sent his work to Mendelssohn with the  request that the composer inform the writer whether or not he had  succeeded in catching the meaning of the music. He desired the  information because \"music's capacity for expression is so vague and  indeterminate.\" Mendelssohn replied:         \"You give the various numbers of the book such titles as 'I       Think of Thee,' 'Melancholy,' 'The Praise of God,' 'A Merry       Hunt.' I can scarcely say whether I thought of these or       other things while composing the music. Another might find       'I Think of Thee' where you find 'Melancholy,' and a real       huntsman might consider 'A Merry Hunt' a veritable 'Praise       of God.' But this is not because, as you think, music is       vague. On the contrary, I believe that musical expression is       altogether too definite, that it reaches regions and dwells       in them whither words cannot follow it and must necessarily       go lame when they make the attempt as you would have them       do.\"    [Sidenote: _The tonal language._]    [Sidenote: _Herbert Spencer's definition._]    [Sidenote: _Natural expression._]    [Sidenote: _Absolute music._]    If I were to try to say why musicians, great musicians, speak thus of  their art, my explanation would be that they have developed, farther  than the rest of mankind have been able to develop it, a language of  tones, which, had it been so willed, might have been developed so as  to fill the place now occupied by articulate speech. Herbert Spencer,  though speaking purely as a scientific investigator, not at all as an  artist, defined music as \"a language of feelings which may ultimately  enable men vividly and completely to impress on each other the  emotions they experience from moment to moment.\" We rely upon speech  to do this now, but ever and anon when, in a moment of emotional  exaltation, we are deserted by the articulate word we revert to the  emotional cry which antedates speech, and find that that cry is  universally understood because it is universally felt. More than  speech, if its primitive element of emotionality be omitted, more than  the primitive language of gesture, music is a natural mode of  expression. All three forms have attained their present stage of  development through conventions. Articulate speech has led in the  development; gesture once occupied a high plane (in the pantomimic  dance of the ancients) but has now retrograded; music, supreme at the  outset, then neglected, is but now pushing forward into the place  which its nature entitles it to occupy. When we conceive of an  art-work composed of such elements, and foregoing the adventitious  helps which may accrue to it from conventional idioms based on  association of ideas, we have before us the concept of Absolute music,  whose content, like that of every noble artistic composition, be it of  tones or forms or colors or thoughts expressed in words, is that high  ideal of goodness, truthfulness, and beauty for which all lofty  imaginations strive. Such artworks are the instrumental compositions  in the classic forms; such, too, may be said to be the high type of  idealized \"Programme\" music, which, like the \"Pastoral\" symphony of  Beethoven, is designed to awaken emotions like those awakened by the  contemplation of things, but does not attempt to depict the things  themselves. Having mentioned Programme music I must, of course, try to  tell what it is; but the exposition must be preceded by an explanation  of a kind of music which, because of its chastity, is set down as the  finest form of absolute music. This is Chamber music.    [Sidenote: _Chamber music._]    [Sidenote: _History of the term._]    [Sidenote: _Haydn a servant._]    In a broad sense, but one not employed in modern definition, Chamber  music is all music not designed for performance in the church or  theatre. (Out-of-door music cannot be considered among these artistic  forms of aristocratic descent.) Once, and indeed at the time of its  invention, the term meant music designed especially for the  delectation of the most eminent patrons of the art--the kings and  nobles whose love for it gave it maintenance and encouragement. This  is implied by the term itself, which has the same etymology wherever  the form of music is cultivated. In Italian it is _Musica da Camera_;  in French, _Musique de Chambre_; in German, _Kammermusik_. All the  terms have a common root. The Greek [Greek: kamara] signified an arch,  a vaulted room, or a covered wagon. In the time of the Frankish kings  the word was applied to the room in the royal palace in which the  monarch's private property was kept, and in which he looked after his  private affairs. When royalty took up the cultivation of music it was  as a private, not as a court, function, and the concerts given for  the entertainment of the royal family took place in the king's  chamber, or private room. The musicians were nothing more nor less  than servants in the royal household. This relationship endured into  the present century. Haydn was a _Hausofficier_ of Prince Esterhazy.  As vice-chapelmaster he had to appear every morning in the Prince's  ante-room to receive orders concerning the dinner-music and other  entertainments of the day, and in the certificate of appointment his  conduct is regulated with a particularity which we, who remember him  and reverence his genius but have forgotten his master, think  humiliating in the extreme.    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's Chamber music._]    Out of this cultivation of music in the private chamber grew the  characteristics of Chamber music, which we must consider if we would  enjoy it ourselves and understand the great reverence which the great  masters of music have always felt for it. Beethoven was the first  great democrat among musicians. He would have none of the shackles  which his predecessors wore, and compelled aristocracy of birth to bow  to aristocracy of genius. But such was his reverence for the style of  music which had grown up in the chambers of the great that he devoted  the last three years of his life almost exclusively to its  composition; the peroration of his proclamation to mankind consists of  his last quartets--the holiest of holy things to the Chamber musicians  of to-day.    [Sidenote: _The characteristics of Chamber music._]    Chamber music represents pure thought, lofty imagination, and deep  learning. These attributes are encouraged by the idea of privacy which  is inseparable from the form. Composers find it the finest field for  the display of their talents because their own skill in creating is to  be paired with trained skill in hearing. Its representative pieces are  written for strings alone--trios, quartets, and quintets. With the  strings are sometimes associated a pianoforte, or one or more of the  solo wind instruments--oboe, clarinet, or French horn; and as a rule  the compositions adhere to classical lines (see Chapter V.). Of  necessity the modesty of the apparatus compels it to forego nearly  all the adventitious helps with which other forms of composition gain  public approval. In the delineative arts Chamber music shows analogy  with correct drawing and good composition, the absence of which cannot  be atoned for by the most gorgeous coloring. In no other style is  sympathy between performers and listeners so necessary, and for that  reason Chamber music should always be heard in a small room with  performers and listeners joined in angelic wedlock. Communities in  which it flourishes under such conditions are musical.
