Of course this was  enough to spoil most children, but Honeysuckle was not at all like other  children. As sweet as the flower from which she took her name, she  listened to her father's slightest command, and obeyed without ever  waiting to be told a second time.    Her father often bought kites for her, of every kind and shape. There  were fish, birds, butterflies, lizards and huge dragons, one of which  had a tail more than thirty feet long. Mr. Min was very skilful in  flying these kites for little Honeysuckle, and so naturally did his  birds and butterflies circle round and hover about in the air that  almost any little western boy would have been deceived and said, \"Why,  there is a real bird, and not a kite at all!\" Then again, he would  fasten a queer little instrument to the string, which made a kind of  humming noise, as he waved his hand from side to side. \"It is the wind  singing, Daddy,\" cried Honeysuckle, clapping her hands with joy;  \"singing a kite-song to both of us.\" Sometimes, to teach his little  darling a lesson if she had been the least naughty, Mr. Min would fasten  queerly twisted scraps of paper, on which were written many Chinese  words, to the string of her favourite kite.    \"What are you doing, Daddy?\" Honeysuckle would ask. \"What can those  queer-looking papers be?\"    \"On every piece is written a sin that we have done.\"    \"What is a sin, Daddy?\"    \"Oh, when Honeysuckle has been naughty; that is a sin!\" he answered  gently. \"Your old nurse is afraid to scold you, and if you are to grow  up to be a good woman, Daddy must teach you what is right.\"    Then Mr. Min would send the kite up high--high over the house-tops,  even higher than the tall Pagoda on the hillside. When all his cord  was let out, he would pick up two sharp stones, and, handing them to  Honeysuckle, would say, \"Now, daughter, cut the string, and the wind  will carry away the sins that are written down on the scraps of paper.\"    \"But, Daddy, the kite is so pretty. Mayn't we keep our sins a little  longer?\" she would innocently ask.    \"No, child; it is dangerous to hold on to one's sins. Virtue is the  foundation of happiness,\" he would reply sternly, choking back his  laughter at her question. \"Make haste and cut the cord.\"    So Honeysuckle, always obedient--at least with her father--would saw  the string in two between the sharp stones, and with a childish cry of  despair would watch her favourite kite, blown by the wind, sail farther  and farther away, until at last, straining her eyes, she could see it  sink slowly to the earth in some far-distant meadow.    \"Now laugh and be happy,\" Mr. Min would say, \"for your sins are all  gone. See that you don't get a new supply of them.\"    Honeysuckle was also fond of seeing the Punch and Judy show, for,  you must know, this old-fashioned amusement for children was enjoyed  by little folks in China, perhaps three thousand years before your  great-grandfather was born. It is even said that the great Emperor, Mu,  when he saw these little dancing images for the first time, was greatly  enraged at seeing one of them making eyes at his favourite wife. He  ordered the showman to be put to death, and it was with difficulty the  poor fellow persuaded his Majesty that the dancing puppets were not  really alive at all, but only images of cloth and clay.    No wonder then Honeysuckle liked to see Punch and Judy if the Son of  Heaven himself had been deceived by their queer antics into thinking  them real people of flesh and blood.    But we must hurry on with our story, or some of our readers will be  asking, \"But where is Dr. Dog? Are you never coming to the hero of this  tale?\" One day when Honeysuckle was sitting inside a shady pavilion that  overlooked a tiny fish-pond, she was suddenly seized with a violent  attack of colic. Frantic with pain, she told a servant to summon her  father, and then without further ado, she fell over in a faint upon the  ground.    When Mr. Min reached his daughter's side, she was still unconscious.  After sending for the family physician to come post haste, he got his  daughter to bed, but although she recovered from her fainting fit, the  extreme pain continued until the poor girl was almost dead from  exhaustion.    Now, when the learned doctor arrived and peered at her from under his  gigantic spectacles, he could not discover the cause of her trouble.  However, like some of our western medical men, he did not confess his  ignorance, but proceeded to prescribe a huge dose of boiling water, to  be followed a little later by a compound of pulverized deer's horn and  dried toadskin.    Poor Honeysuckle lay in agony for three days, all the time growing  weaker and weaker from loss of sleep. Every great doctor in the district  had been summoned for consultation; two had come from Changsha, the  chief city of the province, but all to no avail. It was one of those  cases that seem to be beyond the power of even the most learned  physicians. In the hope of receiving the great reward offered by the  desperate father, these wise men searched from cover to cover in the  great Chinese Cyclopedia of Medicine, trying in vain to find a method of  treating the unhappy maiden. There was even thought of calling in a  certain foreign physician from England, who was in a distant city, and  was supposed, on account of some marvellous cures he had brought to  pass, to be in direct league with the devil. However, the city  magistrate would not allow Mr. Min to call in this outsider, for fear  trouble might be stirred up among the people.    Mr. Min sent out a proclamation in every direction, describing his  daughter's illness, and offering to bestow on her a handsome dowry and  give her in marriage to whoever should be the means of bringing her back  to health and happiness. He then sat at her bedside and waited, feeling  that he had done all that was in his power. There were many answers to  his invitation. Physicians, old and young, came from every part of the  Empire to try their skill, and when they had seen poor Honeysuckle and  also the huge pile of silver shoes her father offered as a wedding gift,  they all fought with might and main for her life; some having been  attracted by her great beauty and excellent reputation, others by the  tremendous reward.    But, alas for poor Honeysuckle! Not one of all those wise men could cure  her! One day, when she was feeling a slight change for the better, she  called her father, and, clasping his hand with her tiny one said, \"Were  it not for your love I would give up this hard fight and pass over into  the dark wood; or, as my old grandmother says, fly up into the Western  Heavens. For your sake, because I am your only child, and especially  because you have no son, I have struggled hard to live, but now I feel  that the next attack of that dreadful pain will carry me away. And oh,  I do not want to die!\"    Here Honeysuckle wept as if her heart would break, and her old father  wept too, for the more she suffered the more he loved her.    Just then her face began to turn pale. \"It is coming! The pain is  coming, father! Very soon I shall be no more. Good-bye, father!  Good-bye; good----.\" Here her voice broke and a great sob almost broke  her father's heart. He turned away from her bedside; he could not bear  to see her suffer. He walked outside and sat down on a rustic bench; his  head fell upon his bosom, and the great salt tears trickled down his  long grey beard.    As Mr. Min sat thus overcome with grief, he was startled at hearing a  low whine. Looking up he saw, to his astonishment, a shaggy mountain dog  about the size of a Newfoundland. The huge beast looked into the old  man's eyes with so intelligent and human an expression, with such a sad  and wistful gaze, that the greybeard addressed him, saying, \"Why have  you come? To cure my daughter?\"    The dog replied with three short barks, wagging his tail vigorously and  turning toward the half-opened door that led into the room where the  girl lay.    By this time, willing to try any chance whatever of reviving his  daughter, Mr. Min bade the animal follow him into Honeysuckle's  apartment. Placing his forepaws upon the side of her bed, the dog looked  long and steadily at the wasted form before him and held his ear  intently for a moment over the maiden's heart. Then, with a slight cough  he deposited from his mouth into her outstretched hand, a tiny stone.  Touching her wrist with his right paw, he motioned to her to swallow the  stone.    \"Yes, my dear, obey him,\" counselled her father, as she turned to him  inquiringly, \"for good Dr. Dog has been sent to your bedside by the  mountain fairies, who have heard of your illness and who wish to invite  you back to life again.\"    Without further delay the sick girl, who was by this time almost burned  away by the fever, raised her hand to her lips and swallowed the tiny  charm. Wonder of wonders! No sooner had it passed her lips than a  miracle occurred. The red flush passed away from her face, the pulse  resumed its normal beat, the pains departed from her body, and she arose  from the bed well and smiling.    Flinging her arms about her father's neck, she cried out in joy, \"Oh,  I am well again; well and happy; thanks to the medicine of the good  physician.\"    The noble dog barked three times, wild with delight at hearing these  tearful words of gratitude, bowed low, and put his nose in Honeysuckle's  outstretched hand.    Mr. Min, greatly moved by his daughter's magical recovery, turned to the  strange physician, saying, \"Noble Sir, were it not for the form you have  taken, for some unknown reason, I would willingly give four times the  sum in silver that I promised for the cure of the girl, into your  possession. As it is, I suppose you have no use for silver, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1872"],[0,"The Red House Mystery (#6)"],[1," in the matter entirely, and please make  your own arrangements about ordering the car for whatever train you wish  to catch. There is one this evening, I understand, which you could go by  if you wished it.\"    Bill gazed with open mouth at Antony. He had no words in his vocabulary  to express what he wanted to say, other than those the Major had  already used. Betty was leaning across to Miss Norris and saying, \"Who's  killed?\" in an awe-struck voice, and Miss Norris, who was instinctively  looking as tragic as she looked on the stage when a messenger announced  the death of one of the cast, stopped for a moment in order to explain.  Mrs. Calladine was quietly mistress of herself.    \"We shall be in the way, yes, I quite understand,\" she said; \"but we  can't just shake the dust of the place off our shoes because something  terrible has happened there. I must see Mark, and we can arrange later  what to do. He must know how very deeply we feel for him. Perhaps we--\"  she hesitated.    \"The Major and I might be useful anyway,\" said Bill. \"Isn't that what  you mean, Mrs. Calladine?\"    \"Where is Mark?\" said the Major suddenly, looking hard at Antony.    Antony looked back unwaveringly--and said nothing.    \"I think,\" said the Major gently, leaning over to Mrs. Calladine, \"that  it would be better if you took Betty back to London to-night.\"    \"Very well,\" she agreed quietly. \"You will come with us, Ruth?\"    \"I'll see you safely there,\" said Bill in a meek voice. He didn't quite  know what was happening, and, having expected to stay at the Red House  for another week, he had nowhere to go to in London, but London seemed  to be the place that everyone was going to, and when he could get Tony  alone for a moment, Tony no doubt would explain.    \"Cayley wants you to stay, Bill. You have to go anyhow, to-morrow, Major  Rumbold?\"    \"Yes. I'll come with you, Mrs. Calladine.\"    \"Mr. Cayley would wish me to say again that you will please not hesitate  to give your own orders, both as regard the car and as regard any  telephoning or telegraphing that you want done.\" He smiled again and  added, \"Please forgive me if I seem to have taken a good deal upon  myself, but I just happened to be handy as a mouthpiece for Cayley.\" He  bowed to them and went into the house.    \"Well!\" said Miss Norris dramatically.    As Antony re-entered the hall, the Inspector from Middleston was just  crossing into the library with Cayley. The latter stopped and nodded to  Antony.    \"Wait a moment, Inspector. Here's Mr. Gillingham. He'd better come with  us.\" And then to Antony, \"This is Inspector Birch.\"    Birch looked inquiringly from one to the other.    \"Mr. Gillingham and I found the body together,\" explained Cayley.    \"Oh! Well, come along, and let's get the facts sorted out a bit. I like  to know where I am, Mr. Gillingham.\"    \"We all do.\"    \"Oh!\" He looked at Antony with interest. \"D'you know where you are in  this case?\"    \"I know where I'm going to be.\"    \"Where's that?\"    \"Put through it by Inspector Birch,\" said Antony with a smile.    The inspector laughed genially.    \"Well, I'll spare you as much as I can. Come along.\"    They went into the library. The inspector seated himself at a  writing-table, and Cayley sat in a chair by the side of it. Antony made  himself comfortable in an armchair and prepared to be interested.    \"We'll start with the dead man,\" said the Inspector. \"Robert Ablett,  didn't you say?\" He took out his notebook.    \"Yes. Brother of Mark Ablett, who lives here.\"    \"Ah!\" He began to sharpen a pencil. \"Staying in the house?\"    \"Oh, no!\"    Antony listened attentively while Cayley explained all that he knew  about Robert. This was news to him. \"I see. Sent out of the country in  disgrace. What had he done?\"    \"I hardly know. I was only about twelve at the time. The sort of age  when you're told not to ask questions.\"    \"Inconvenient questions?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"So you don't really know whether he had been merely wild or--or  wicked?\"    \"No. Old Mr. Ablett was a clergyman,\" added Cayley. \"Perhaps what might  seem wicked to a clergyman might seem only wild to a man of the world.\"    \"I daresay, Mr. Cayley,\" smiled the Inspector. \"Anyhow, it was more  convenient to have him in Australia?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Mark Ablett never talked about him?\"    \"Hardly ever. He was very much ashamed of him, and--well, very glad he  was in Australia.\"    \"Did he write Mark sometimes?\"    \"Occasionally. Perhaps three or four times in the last five years.\"    \"Asking for money?\"    \"Something of the sort. I don't think Mark always answered them. As far  as I know, he never sent any money.\"    \"Now your own private opinion, Mr. Cayley. Do you think that Mark was  unfair to his brother? Unduly hard on him?\"    \"They'd never liked each other as boys. There was never any affection  between them. I don't know whose fault it was in the first place--if  anybody's.\"    \"Still, Mark might have given him a hand?\"    \"I understand,\" said Cayley, \"that Robert spent his whole life asking  for hands.\"    The inspector nodded.    \"I know that sort. Well, now, we'll go on to this morning. This letter  that Mark got--did you see it?\"    \"Not at the time. He showed it to me afterwards.\"    \"Any address?\"    \"No. A half-sheet of rather dirty paper.\"    \"Where is it now?\"    \"I don't know. In Mark's pocket, I expect.\"    \"Ah!\" He pulled at his beard. \"Well, we'll come to that. Can you  remember what it said?\"    \"As far as I remember, something like this: 'Mark, your loving brother  is coming to see you to-morrow, all the way from Australia. I give you  warning so that you will be able to conceal your surprise, but not I  hope, your pleasure. Expect him at three, or thereabouts.'\"    \"Ah!\" The inspector copied it down carefully. \"Did you notice the  postmark?\"    \"London.\"    \"And what was Mark's attitude?\"    \"Annoyance, disgust--\" Cayley hesitated.    \"Apprehension?\"    \"N-no, not exactly. Or, rather, apprehension of an unpleasant interview,  not of any unpleasant outcome for himself.\"    \"You mean that he wasn't afraid of violence, or blackmail, or anything  of that sort?\"    \"He didn't appear to be.\"    \"Right.... Now then, he arrived, you say, about three o'clock?\"    \"Yes, about that.\"    \"Who was in the house then?\"    \"Mark and myself, and some of the servants. I don't know which. Of  course, you will ask them directly, no doubt.\"    \"With your permission. No guests?\"    \"They were out all day playing golf,\" explained Cayley. \"Oh, by the  way,\" he put in, \"if I may interrupt a moment, will you want to see  them at all? It isn't very pleasant for them now, naturally, and I  suggested--\" he turned to Antony, who nodded back to him. \"I understand  that they want to go back to London this evening. There's no objection  to that, I suppose?\"    \"You will let me have their names and addresses in case I want to  communicate with them?\"    \"Of course. One of them is staying on, if you would like to see him  later, but they only came back from their golf as we crossed the hall.\"    \"That's all right, Mr. Cayley. Well, now then, let's go back to three  o'clock. Where were you when Robert arrived?\"    Cayley explained how he had been sitting in the hall, how Audrey had  asked him where the master was, and how he had said that he had last  seen him going up to the Temple.    \"She went away, and I went on with my book. There was a step on the  stairs, and I looked up to see Mark coming down. He went into the  office, and I went on with my book again. I went into the library for  a moment, to refer to another book, and when I was in there I heard a  shot. At least, it was a loud bang, I wasn't sure if it was a shot. I  stood and listened. Then I came slowly to the door and looked out. Then  I went back again, hesitated a bit, you know, and finally decided to go  across to the office, and make sure that it was all right. I turned the  handle of the door and found it was locked. Then I got frightened, and I  banged at the door, and shouted, and--well, that was when Mr. Gillingham  arrived.\" He went on to explain how they had found the body.    The inspector looked at him with a smile.    \"Yes, well, we shall have to go over some of that again, Mr. Cayley. Mr.  Mark, now. You thought he was in the Temple. Could he have come in, and  gone up to his room, without your seeing him?\"    \"There are back stairs. He wouldn't have used them in the ordinary way,  of course. But I wasn't in the hall all the afternoon. He might easily  have gone upstairs without my knowing anything about it.\"    \"So that you weren't surprised when you saw him coming down?\"    \"Oh, not a bit.\"    \"Well, did he say anything?\"    \"He said, 'Robert's here?' or something of the sort. I suppose he'd  heard the bell, or the voices in the hall.\"    \"Which way does his bedroom face? Could he have seen him coming down the  drive?\"    \"He might have, yes.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, then, I said 'Yes,' and he gave a sort of shrug, and said, 'Don't  go too far away, I might want you'; and then went in.\"    \"What did you think he meant by that?\"    \"Well, he consults me a good deal, you know. I'm his sort of unofficial  solicitor in a kind of way.\"    \"This was a business meeting rather than a brotherly one?\"    \"Oh, yes. That's how he regarded it, I'm sure.\"    \"Yes. How long was it before you heard the shot?\"    \"Very soon. Two minutes, perhaps.\"    The inspector finished his writing, and then regarded Cayley  thoughtfully. Suddenly he said:    \"What is your theory of Robert's death?\"    Cayley shrugged his shoulders.    \"You've probably seen more than I've seen,\" he answered. \"It's your job.  I can only speak as a layman--and Mark's friend.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Then I should say that Robert came here meaning trouble, and bringing  a revolver with him. He produced it almost at once, Mark tried to get  it from him, there was a little struggle perhaps, and it went off. Mark  lost his head, finding"]]]
