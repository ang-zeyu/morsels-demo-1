Beware, O King, that thou gather not around thee such ministers as follow  the desires of a corrupt inclination, as have cast behind their backs that  which hath been committed into their hands and manifestly betrayed their  trust. Be bounteous to others as God hath been bounteous to thee, and  abandon not the interests of thy people to the mercy of such ministers as  these. Lay not aside the fear of God, and be thou of them that act  uprightly. Gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst  perceive the fragrance of faith and of justice, and take thou counsel with  them, and choose whatever is best in thy sight, and be of them that act  generously.    Know thou for a certainty that whoso disbelieveth in God is neither  trustworthy nor truthful. This, indeed, is the truth, the undoubted truth.  He that acteth treacherously towards God will, also, act treacherously  towards his king. Nothing whatever can deter such a man from evil, nothing  can hinder him from betraying his neighbour, nothing can induce him to  walk uprightly.    Take heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of thy state into  the hands of others, and repose not thy confidence in ministers unworthy  of thy trust, and be not of them that live in heedlessness. Shun them  whose hearts are turned away from thee, and place not thy confidence in  them, and entrust them not with thy affairs and the affairs of such as  profess thy faith. Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the  shepherd of God's flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to  the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the  ordinances of God will be trustworthy or sincere in the faith they  profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest their  devices and mischief hurt thee. Turn away from them, and fix thy gaze upon  God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful. He that giveth up  himself wholly to God, God shall, assuredly, be with him; and he that  placeth his complete trust in God, God shall, verily, protect him from  whatsoever may harm him, and shield him from the wickedness of every evil  plotter.    Wert thou to incline thine ear unto My speech and observe My counsel, God  would exalt thee to so eminent a position that the designs of no man on  the whole earth could ever touch or hurt thee. Observe, O King, with thine  inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts of God, and walk not  in the paths of the oppressor. Seize thou, and hold firmly within the  grasp of thy might, the reins of the affairs of thy people, and examine in  person whatever pertaineth unto them. Let nothing escape thee, for therein  lieth the highest good.    Render thanks unto God for having chosen thee out of the whole world, and  made thee king over them that profess thy faith. It well beseemeth thee to  appreciate the wondrous favours with which God hath favoured thee, and to  magnify continually His name. Thou canst best praise Him if thou lovest  His loved ones, and dost safeguard and protect His servants from the  mischief of the treacherous, that none may any longer oppress them. Thou  shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of God amongst them, that  thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in His law.    Shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy  subjects, God would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of  the seen and would strengthen thee in thine affairs. No God is there but  Him. All creation and its empire are His. Unto Him return the works of the  faithful.    Place not thy reliance on thy treasures. Put thy whole confidence in the  grace of God, thy Lord. Let Him be thy trust in whatever thou doest, and  be of them that have submitted themselves to His Will. Let Him be thy  helper and enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the  treasuries of the heavens and of the earth. He bestoweth them upon whom He  will, and from whom He will He withholdeth them. There is none other God  but Him, the All-Possessing, the All-Praised. All are but paupers at the  door of His mercy; all are helpless before the revelation of His  sovereignty, and beseech His favours.    Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that  serve thee. Bestow upon them according to their needs and not to the  extent that will enable them to lay up riches for themselves, to deck  their persons, to embellish their homes, to acquire the things that are of  no benefit unto them, and to be numbered with the extravagant. Deal with  them with undeviating justice, so that none among them may either suffer  want, or be pampered with luxuries. This is but manifest justice.    Allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and  worthy of honour, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy of the  contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon Our arrival  in the City (Constantinople), and to it We bear witness. We found among  its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived  in the midst of excessive riches, whilst others were in dire want and  abject poverty. This ill beseemeth thy sovereignty, and is unworthy of thy  rank.    Let My counsel be acceptable to thee, and strive thou to rule with equity  among men, that God may exalt thy name and spread abroad the fame of thy  justice in all the world. Beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the  expense of thy subjects. Fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright in  heart who, at every break of day, bewail their plight, and be unto them a  benignant sovereign. They, verily, are thy treasures on earth. It behoveth  thee, therefore, to safeguard thy treasures from the assaults of them who  wish to rob thee. Inquire into their affairs, and ascertain, every year,  nay every month, their condition, and be not of them that are careless of  their duty.    Set before thine eyes God's unerring Balance and, as one standing in His  Presence, weigh in that Balance thine actions every day, every moment of  thy life. Bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to a reckoning,  on the Day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of God, the  Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble.    It behoveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun, which fostereth the  growth of all beings, and giveth to each its due, whose benefits are not  inherent in itself, but are ordained by Him Who is the Most Powerful, the  Almighty. The king should be as generous, as liberal in his mercy as the  clouds, the outpourings of whose bounty are showered upon every land, by  the behest of Him Who is the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Knowing.    Have a care not to entrust thine affairs of state entirely into another's  hands. None can discharge thy functions better than thine own self. Thus  do We make clear unto thee Our words of wisdom, and send down upon thee  that which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of oppression  to the right hand of justice, and approach the resplendent ocean of His  favours. Such is the path which the kings that were before thee have  trodden, they that acted equitably towards their subjects, and walked in  the ways of undeviating justice.    Thou art God's shadow on earth. Strive, therefore, to act in such a manner  as befitteth so eminent, so august a station. If thou dost depart from  following the things We have caused to descend upon thee and taught thee,  thou wilt, assuredly, be derogating from that great and priceless honour.  Return, then, and cleave wholly unto God, and cleanse thine heart from the  world and all its vanities, and suffer not the love of any stranger to  enter and dwell therein. Not until thou dost purify thine heart from every  trace of such love can the brightness of the light of God shed its  radiance upon it, for to none hath God given more than one heart. This,  verily, hath been decreed and written down in His ancient Book. And as the  human heart, as fashioned by God, is one and undivided, it behoveth thee  to take heed that its affections be, also, one and undivided. Cleave thou,  therefore, with the whole affection of thine heart, unto His love, and  withdraw it from the love of any one besides Him, that He may aid thee to  immerse thyself in the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a  true upholder of His oneness. God is My witness. My sole purpose in  revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory  things of the earth, and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory,  that thou mayest, by the leave of God, be of them that abide and rule  therein....    Let thine ear be attentive, O King, to the words We have addressed to  thee. Let the oppressor desist from his tyranny, and cut off the  perpetrators of injustice from among them that profess thy faith. By the  righteousness of God! The tribulations We have sustained are such that any  pen that recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish. No one of  them that truly believe and uphold the unity of God can bear the burden of  their recital. So great have been Our sufferings that even the eyes of Our  enemies have wept over Us, and beyond them those of every discerning  person. And to all these trials have We been subjected, in spite of Our  action in approaching thee, and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy  shadow, that thou mightest be a stronghold unto them that believe in and  uphold the unity of God.    Have I, O King, ever disobeyed thee? Have I, at any time, transgressed any  of thy laws? Can any of thy ministers that represented thee in 'Iraq  produce any proof that can establish my disloyalty to thee? No, by Him Who  is the Lord of all worlds! Not for one short moment did We rebel against  thee, or against any of thy ministers.

Tell us not the tale of Layli or of Majnun's woe--    Thy love hath made the world forget the loves of long ago.    When once thy name was on the tongue, the lovers caught it    And it set the speakers and the hearers dancing to and fro.(87)    And of divine wisdom and heavenly counsel, [Rumi says]:      Each moon, O my beloved, for three days I go mad;    Today's the first of these--'Tis why thou seest me glad.    We hear that thou hast journeyed to Tabriz and Tiflis to disseminate  knowledge, or that some other high purpose hath taken thee to  Sanandaj.(88), (89)    O My eminent friend! Those who progress in mystic wayfaring are of four  kinds. I shall describe them in brief, that the grades and qualities of  each kind may become plain to thee.          The First Valley      If the travelers seek after the goal of the Intended One (maqsud), this  station appertaineth to the self--but that self which is \"The Self of God  standing within Him with laws.\"(90)    On this plane, the self is not rejected but beloved; it is well-pleasing  and not to be shunned. Although at the beginning, this plane is the realm  of conflict, yet it endeth in attainment to the throne of splendor. As  they have said: \"O Abraham of this day, O Friend Abraham of the Spirit!  Kill these four birds of prey,\"(91) that after death the riddle of life  may be unraveled.    This is the plane of the soul who is pleasing unto God. Refer to the  verse:      O thou soul who art well assured,    Return to thy Lord, well-pleased, and pleasing unto Him.(92)    which endeth:      Enter thou among My servants,    And enter thou My paradise.(93)    This station hath many signs, unnumbered proofs. Hence it is said:  \"Hereafter We will show them Our signs in the regions of the earth, and in  themselves, until it become manifest unto them that it is the truth,\"(94)  and that there is no God save Him.    One must, then, read the book of his own self, rather than some treatise  on rhetoric. Wherefore He hath said, \"Read thy Book: There needeth none  but thyself to make out an account against thee this day.\"(95)    The story is told of a mystic knower, who went on a journey with a learned  grammarian as his companion. They came to the shore of the Sea of  Grandeur. The knower straightway flung himself into the waves, but the  grammarian stood lost in his reasonings, which were as words that are  written on water. The knower called out to him, \"Why dost thou not  follow?\" The grammarian answered, \"O Brother, I dare not advance. I must  needs go back again.\" Then the knower cried, \"Forget what thou didst read  in the books of Sibavayh and Qawlavayh, of Ibn-i-Hajib and  Ibn-i-Malik,(96) and cross the water.\"      The death of self is needed here, not rhetoric:    Be nothing, then, and walk upon the waves.(97)    Likewise is it written, \"And be ye not like those who forget God, and whom  He hath therefore caused to forget their own selves. These are the wicked  doers.\"(98)          The Second Valley      If the wayfarer's goal be the dwelling of the Praiseworthy One  (Mahmud),(99) this is the station of primal reason which is known as the  Prophet and the Most Great Pillar.(100) Here reason signifieth the divine,  universal mind, whose sovereignty enlighteneth all created things--nor doth  it refer to every feeble brain; for it is as the wise Sana'i hath written:      How can feeble reason encompass the Qur'an,    Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?    Wouldst thou that the mind should not entrap thee?    Teach it the science of the love of God!    On this plane, the traveler meeteth with many a trial and reverse. Now is  he lifted up to heaven, now is he cast into the depths. As it hath been  said: \"Now Thou drawest me to the summit of glory, again Thou castest me  into the lowest abyss.\" The mystery treasured in this plane is divulged in  the following holy verse from the Surih of THE CAVE:(101)    \"And thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose, pass on the right of  their cave, and when it set, leave them on the left, while they were in  its spacious chamber. This is one of the signs of God. Guided indeed is he  whom God guideth; but for him whom He misleadeth, thou shalt by no means  find a patron.\"    If a man could know what lieth hid in this one verse, it would suffice  him. Wherefore, in praise of such as these, He hath said: \"Men whom  neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of  God....\"(102)    This station conferreth the true standard of knowledge, and freeth man  from tests. In this realm, to search after knowledge is irrelevant, for He  hath said concerning the guidance of travelers on this plane, \"Fear God,  and God will instruct thee.\"(103) And again: \"Knowledge is a light which  God casteth into the heart of whomsoever He willeth.\"(104)    Wherefore, a man should make ready his heart that it be worthy of the  descent of heavenly grace, and that the bounteous Cup-Bearer may give him  to drink of the wine of bestowal from the merciful vessel. \"For the like  of this let the travailers travail!\"(105)    And now do I say, \"Verily we are from God, and to Him shall we  return.\"(106)          The Third Valley      If the loving seekers wish to live within the precincts of the Attracting  One (Majdhub),(107) no soul may dwell on this Kingly Throne save the  beauty of love. This realm is not to be pictured in words.      Love shunneth this world and that world too,    In him are lunacies seventy-and-two.    The minstrel of love harpeth this lay:    Servitude enslaveth, kingship doth betray.(108)    This plane requireth pure affection and the bright stream of fellowship.  In telling of these companions of the Cave He saith: \"They speak not till  He hath spoken; and they do His bidding.\"(109)    On this plane, neither the reign of reason is sufficient nor the authority  of self. Hence, one of the Prophets of God hath asked: \"O my Lord, how  shall we reach unto Thee?\" And the answer came, \"Leave thyself behind, and  then approach Me.\"    These are a people who deem the lowest place to be one with the throne of  glory, and to them beauty's bower differeth not from the field of a battle  fought in the cause of the Beloved.    The denizens of this plane speak no words--but they gallop their chargers.  They see but the inner reality of the Beloved. To them all words of sense  are meaningless, and senseless words are full of meaning. They cannot tell  one limb from another, one part from another. To them the mirage is the  real river; to them going away is returning. Wherefore hath it been said:      The story of Thy beauty reached the hermit's dell;    Crazed, he sought the Tavern where the wine they buy and sell.    The love of Thee hath leveled down the fort of patience,    The pain of Thee hath firmly barred the gate of hope as well.(110)    In this realm, instruction is assuredly of no avail.      The lover's teacher is the Loved One's beauty,    His face their lesson and their only book.    Learning of wonderment, of longing love their duty,    Not on learned chapters and dull themes they look.    The chain that binds them is His musky hair,    The Cyclic Scheme,(111) to them, is but to Him a stair.(112)    Here followeth a supplication to God, the Exalted, the Glorified:      O Lord! O Thou Whose bounty granteth wishes!    I stand before Thee, all save Thee forgetting.    Grant that the mote of knowledge in my spirit    Escape desire and the lowly clay;    Grant that Thine ancient gift, this drop of wisdom,    Merge with Thy mighty sea.(113)    Thus do I say: There is no power or might save in God, the Protector, the  Self-Subsistent.(114)          The Fourth Valley      If the mystic knowers be of those who have reached to the beauty of the  Beloved One (Mahbub), this station is the apex of consciousness and the  secret of divine guidance. This is the center of the mystery: \"He doth  what He willeth, ordaineth what He pleaseth.\"(115)    Were all the denizens of earth and heaven to unravel this shining  allusion, this darksome riddle, until the Day when the Trumpet soundeth,  yet would they fail to comprehend even a letter thereof, for this is the  station of God's immutable decree, His foreordained mystery. Hence, when  searchers inquired of this, He made reply, \"This is a bottomless sea which  none shall ever fathom.\"(116) And they asked again, and He answered, \"It  is the blackest of nights through which none can find his way.\"    Whoso knoweth this secret will assuredly hide it, and were he to reveal  but its faintest trace they would nail him to the cross. Yet, by the  Living God, were there any true seeker, I would divulge it to him; for  they have said: \"Love is a light that never dwelleth in a heart possessed  by fear.\"    Verily, the wayfarer who journeyeth unto God, unto the Crimson Pillar in  the snow-white path, will never reach unto his heavenly goal unless he  abandoneth all that men possess: \"And if he feareth not God, God will make  him to fear all things; whereas all things fear him who feareth God.\"(117)      Speak in the Persian tongue, though the Arab please thee more;    A lover hath many a tongue at his command.(118)    How sweet is this couplet which revealeth such a truth:      See, our hearts come open like shells, when He raineth grace like                pearls,    And our lives are ready targets, when agony's arrows He hurls.    And were it not contrary to the Law of the Book, I would verily bequeath a  part of My possessions to the one who would put Me to death, and I would  name him My heir; yea, I would bestow upon him a portion, would render him  thanks, would seek to refresh Mine eyes with the touch of his hand. But  what can I do? I have no possessions, no power, and this is what God hath  ordained.(119)    Methinks at this moment, I "]]]
