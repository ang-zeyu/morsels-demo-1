His wife Sita is  possessed of much womanly grace and every wifely virtue; and the  sorrowful story of the warrior-god and his faithful spouse has appealed  to deep sympathies in the human breast. The worship of Rama has seldom,  if ever, degenerated into lasciviousness. In spite, however, of the  charm thrown around the life of Rama and Sita by the genius of Valmiki  and Tulsida,[26] it is Krishna, not Rama, that has attained the greatest  popularity among the \"descents\" of Vishnu.    [Sidenote: Krishna.  His early life a travesty of the life of Christ, according to  the Gospel of the Infancy.]  Very different morally from that of Rama is the character of Krishna.  While Rama is but a partial manifestation of divinity Krishna is a full  manifestation; yet what a manifestation! He is represented as full of  naughty tricks in his youth, although exercising the highest powers of  deity; and, when he grows up, his conduct is grossly immoral and  disgusting. It is most startling to think that this being is by grave  writers--like the authors of the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata  Purana--made the highest of the gods, or, indeed, the only real God.  Stranger still, if possible, is the probability that the early life of  Krishna--in part, at least--is a dreadful travesty of the early life of  Christ, as given in the apocryphal gospels, especially the Gospel of the  Infancy. The falling off in the apocryphal gospels, when compared with  the canonical, is truly sad; but the falling off even from the  apocryphal ones, in the Hindu books, is altogether sickening.[27]    A very striking characteristic of modern Hinduism is what is termed  _bhakti_, or devotion. There are three great ways of attaining to  salvation: _karma marga_, or the way of ceremonial works; _jnana  marga_, or the way of knowledge, and _bhakti marga_, or the way of  devotion.    [Sidenote: Doctrine of _bhakti_ introduced.  Influence of the system.  Mixed with Buddhist elements.  Exaltation of the _guru_.]  The notion of trust in the gods was familiar to the mind of India from  Vedic days, but the deity was indistinct and unsympathetic, and there  could hardly be love and attachment to him. But there now arose the  doctrine of _bhakti_ (devotion), which resolved religion into emotion.  It came into the Hindu system rather abruptly; and many learned men have  traced its origin to the influence of Christianity. This is quite  possible; but perhaps the fact is hardly proved. Contact with  Christianity, however, probably accelerated a process which had  previously begun. At all events, the system of _bhakti_ has had, and  still has, great sway in India, particularly in Bengal, among the  followers of Chaitanya, and the large body of people in western India  who style themselves _Vaishnavas_ or _Bhaktas_ (devotees). The popular  poetry of Maharashtra, as exemplified in such poets as Tukarama, is an  impassioned inculcation of devotion to Vithoba of Pandharpur, who is a  manifestation of Krishna. Into the _bhakti_ system of western India  Buddhist elements have entered; and the school of devotees is often  denominated Bauddha-Vaishnava. Along with extravagant idolatry it  inculcates generally, at least in the Maratha country, a pure morality;  and the latter it apparently owes to Buddhism. Yet there are many sad  lapses from purity. Almost of necessity the worship of Krishna led to  corruption. The hymns became erotic; and movements hopeful at their  commencement--like that of Chaitanya of Bengal, in the sixteenth  century--soon grievously fell off in character. The attempt to make  religion consist of emotion without thought, of _bhakti_ without  _jnana_, had disastrous issues. Coincident with the development of  _bhakti_ was the exaltation of the _guru_, or religious teacher, which  soon amounted to deification--a change traceable from about the twelfth  century A.D.    [Sidenote: Explanations of Krishna's evil deeds.]  When pressed on the subject of Krishna's evil deeds many are anxious to  explain them as allegorical representations of the union between the  divinity and true worshipers; but some interpret them in the most  literal way possible. This is done especially by the followers of  Vallabha Acharya.[28] These men attained a most unenviable notoriety  about twenty years ago, when a case was tried in the Supreme Court of  Bombay, which revealed the practice of the most shameful licentiousness  by the religious teachers and their female followers, and this as a part  of worship! The disgust excited was so great and general that it was  believed the influence of the sect was at an end; but this hope  unhappily has not been realized.    [Sidenote: Reforms attempted.  Kabir.  Nanak.  Failure of all reforms.]  Reformers have arisen from time to time in India; men who saw the  deplorable corruption of religion, and strove to restore it to what they  considered purity. Next to Buddha we may mention Kabir, to whom are  ascribed many verses still popular. Probably the doctrine of the unity  of God, as maintained by the Mohammedans, had impressed him. He opposed  idolatry, caste, and Brahmanical assumption. Yet his monotheism was a  kind of pantheism. His date may be the beginning of the fifteenth  century. Nanak followed and founded the religion of the Sikhs. His  sacred book, the _Granth_, is mainly pantheistic; it dwells earnestly on  devotion, especially devotion to the _guru_. The Sikhs now seem slowly  relapsing into idolatry. In truth, the history of all attempts at  reformation in India has been most discouraging. Sect after sect has  successively risen to some elevation above the prevalent idolatry; and  then gradually, as by some irresistible gravitation, it has sunk back  into the _mare magnum_ of Hinduism. If we regard experience,  purification from within is hopeless; the struggle for it is only a  repetition of the toil of Sisyphus, and always with the same sad issue.  Deliverance must come from without--from the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    [Sidenote: Influence of the Tantras.  Worship of the Sakti.]  We mentioned the Tantras as exerting great influence in later days.[29]  In these the worship of Siva, and, still more, that of his wife, is  predominant. The deity is now supposed to possess a double nature--one  quiescent, one active; the latter being regarded as the _Sakti_ or  energy of the god, otherwise called his wife. The origin of the system  is not fully explained; nor is the date of its rise ascertained. The  worship assumes wild, extravagant forms, generally obscene, sometimes  bloody. It is divided into two schools--that of the right hand and that  of the left. The former runs into mysticism and magic in complicated  observances, and the latter into the most appalling licentiousness. The  worship of the Sakti, or female principle, has become a most elaborate  system. The beings adored are \"the most outrageous divinities which man  has ever conceived.\"[30] Sorcery began early in India; but it is in  connection with this system that it attains to full development. Human  sacrifices are a normal part of the worship when fully performed. We  cannot go farther into detail. It is profoundly saddening to think that  such abominations are committed; it is still more saddening to think  that they are performed as a part of divine worship. Conscience,  however, is so far alive that these detestable rites are practiced only  in secret, and few, if any, are willing to confess that they have been  initiated as worshipers.    [Sidenote: Modern ritual.]  We have not yet said much about the ritual of modern days. It is  exceedingly complicated. In the case of the god Siva the rites are as  follows, when performed by a priest in the temple:         [Sidenote: Worship of Siva.]       The Brahman first bathes, then enters the temple and bows to the       god. He anoints the image with clarified butter or boiled oil;       pours pure water over it; and then wipes it dry. He grinds some       white powder, mixing it with water; dips the ends of his three       forefingers in it and draws them across the image. He sits down;       meditates; places rice and _durwa_ grass on the image--places a       flower on his own head, and then on the top of the image; then       another flower on the image, and another, and another--accompanying       each act with the recitation of sacred spells; places white powder,       flowers, bilva-leaves, incense, meat-offerings, rice, plantains,       and a lamp before the image; repeats the name of Siva, with       praises, then prostrates himself before the image. In the evening       he returns, washes his feet, prostrates himself before the door,       opens the door, places a lamp within, offers milk, sweet-meats, and       fruits to the image, prostrates himself before it, locks the door,       and departs.    Very similar is the worship paid to Vishnu:         [Sidenote: Worship of Vishnu.]       The priest bathes, and then awakes the sleeping god by blowing a       shell and ringing a bell. More abundant offerings are made than to       Siva. About noon, fruits, roots, soaked peas, sweet-meats, etc.,       are presented. Then, later, boiled rice, fried herbs, and spices;       but no flesh, fish, nor fowl. After dinner, betel-nut. The god is       then left to sleep, and the temple is shut up for some hours.       Toward evening curds, butter, sweet-meats, fruits, are presented.       At sunset a lamp is brought, and fresh offerings made. Lights are       waved before the image; a small bell is rung; water is presented       for washing the mouth, face, and feet, with a towel to dry them. In       a few minutes the offerings and the lamp are removed; and the god       is left to sleep in the dark.    The prescribed worship is not always "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#6)"],[1," hands as much as possible out of the harsh and  dirty part of the executive work, that the European officers may be  looked up to with respect as the effectual check upon the native  administrators; always prepared to check any disposition on their  part to neglect their duty or abuse their power, and thereby bring  their Government into disrepute. Of course, the outrage at Mooltan  must be avenged, and our authority there established; but, when this  is done, Currie should be advised to avoid the rock upon which our  friend Macnaghten was wrecked. We are too impatient to jump down the  throats of those who venture to look us in the face, and to force  upon them our modes of doing the work of the country, and to  superintend the doing it ourselves in all its details, or having it  done by creatures of our own, commonly ten times more odious to the  people than we are ourselves.    It is unfortunate that this outrage, and the excitement to which it  has given rise, should have come so quickly upon Lord Hardinge's  assurances at the London feast, and amidst the turmoil of popular  movements at home. It has its use in showing us the necessity of  being always prepared.    Baba Bulwunt Row tells me that he has got a letter from you in the  form of Khureela, and claims one from me on that ground. Shall I  comply? We have avoided this hitherto, as the Pundits put him up to  claim everything that the Bae's family had, not even omitting the  Thalone principality; and hints have been dropped of a mission to  England, if the money could be got. I wish to subdue these  pretensions for his own sake, that he may not be entirely ruined by  temptations to expensive displays. He has now got the entire  management of his own affairs, and is a sensible, well-disposed lad.  He was never recognised as the Bae's successor by Government or the  Agent, nor was he written to on the Bae's death. Cunput Row Bhaca was  the person addressed in the letter of condolence. His son has run  through all he has or can borrow, and is in a bad way. Moresor Row  has the reputation of being very rich, though he pleads poverty  always. The whole of the Saugor territories, save Mundla, have  benefited by two very fine seasons, with great demand for land  produce, and the people are happy. I have asked for reductions in  Mundla, to save the little of tillage and population that has been  left. The whole revenue is a mere trifle in such a jungle as you know  it to be, and when once the people go off, there is no getting them  back. Deer destroy the crops upon the few fields left, tigers come to  eat the deer, and malaria follows, to sweep off the remaining few  families.    I must not prose any longer at present. Amelia often talks of you,  and begs to be kindly remembered.                  Ever yours sincerely,             (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Hon. Sir T. H. Maddock,         &c. &c. &c.                    ____________________________                                                Jhansee, 28th May, 1848.  My Dear Maddock,    I yesterday sent off by Dawk Bangy an elaborate Report on Dacoits by  hereditary profession, and on the measures adopted by the Government  of India for their suppression, and hope it will reach Calcutta  before the rains set in heavily. Government may be justly proud of  the good which it shows to have been effected for the people of India  in the course of a brief period; and I am glad that you have for this  period been a member of it. There is much in the Report to interest  the general reader, but much of what is inserted would, of course,  have been left out by any one who had to consult the wishes of such  readers only.    At this time last year I had not the slightest hope of ever being  able to lay such a Report before Government; for I never expected to  find leisure in my present office, and could not carry the requisite  records with me, if driven away by sickness, to where I might find  it. The papers lay mouldering in an old box, to which I had consigned  them in 1840, when I withdrew them from the press, under the  impression that Lord Auckland thought that the exposition of the  terrible evil ought not to appear till more progress had been made in  its suppression; as G. Thompson and other itinerant orators would be  glad to get hold of them to abuse the Government. The Report is  infinitely more interesting and complete than it could have been  then, and may bid defiance to all such orators.    If printed, it will take from 400 to 450 pages, such as those of the  late Report on the Indian Penal Code, and be a neat and useful volume  for reference. I began it in the rains last year, but was stopped  short by a fever, and unable to continue it till I set out on my  tour. Three-fourths of it was written in the intervals between the  morning's march and breakfast-time during my tour through the Saugor  territories.    The tables of dacoitees ascertained to have been committed by the  dacoits described, and of the conditionally pardoned offenders, will  follow, and be found useful for reference, but should not, perhaps,  be in the same volume with the text of the Report; of that, however,  I leave Government to judge. I thank God that I have been able to  place before it so complete and authentic a record of what has been  done to carry out its views.                  Ever most sincerely yours,               (Signed)         W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Hon. Sir T. H. Maddock,         &c. &c. &c.                                         Jhansee, 15th August, 1848.    My Lord,    As it is possible that the letter which I addressed to your Lordship  on the 6th of March last, and sent open to Mr. Melvill, the Secretary  at the India House, may have miscarried; I write to mention that I  sent it, lest it might be supposed that I was insensible of the  kindness which induced your Lordship to write to me before leaving  India. The work which made me delay so long to reply to that letter  is now being printed in Calcutta, under the authority of Government;  and, as it contains much that is curious and entertaining, and  honourable to our rule in India, I trust at no distant day to have  the honour of presenting a copy to your Lordship.    Amidst events of such absorbing interest as are now taking place  every day in Europe, India cannot continue long to engage much of  your thoughts; for, with the exception of the little outbreak at  Mooltan, tranquillity prevails, and is likely to do so for some time.  There has been delay in putting down the Mooltan rebels, but the next  mail will, I hope, take home news of the work having been effectually  done. This delay seems to have arisen from a notion that troops ought  not to be employed in the hot winds and rains; but when occasion  requires they can be employed at all times, and the people of India  require to be assured that they can be so. It has not, I think, been  found that troops actually employed in the hot winds and rains lose  more men than in cantonments, at least native troops.    It was, I think, your Lordship's intention that, in the Lahore state,  we should guide, direct, and supervise the administration, but not  take all the executive upon ourselves, to the exclusion of all the  old native aristocracy, as we had done in Afghanistan. This policy  has not, I am afraid, been adhered to sufficiently; and we have,  probably, less of the sympathy and cordial good-will of the higher  and middle classes than we should otherwise have had. But I am too  far from the scene to be a fair judge in such matters.    The policy of interposing Hindoo native states between us and the  beggarly fanatical countries to the north-west no wise man can, I  think, doubt; for, however averse our Government may be to encroach  and creep on, it would be drawn on by the intermeddling dispositions  and vainglory of local authorities; and every step would be ruinous,  and lead to another still more ruinous. With the Hindoo  principalities on our border we shall do very well, and trust that we  shall long be able to maintain them in the state required for their  own interests and ours.    I wish England would put forth its energies to raise the colony of  New Zealand, the queen of the Pacific Ocean; for the relations  between that island and India must some day become very intimate, and  the sooner it begins the better. I am very glad to find by the last  mail that the French have put their affairs into better hands--those  of practical men, instead of visionaries.               Believe me, with great respect,                 Your Lordship's obedient, humble servant,                     (Signed)         W. H. SLEEMAN.    To Lieut.-General the Right Hon.  Henry Viscount Hardinge, G.C.B.,          &c. &c. &c.                          ____________________________                                               Jhansee, 22nd August 1848.    My Dear Sir Erskine,    I thank you for kindly sending me a copy of your Address to the  Native Youth at Bombay and their Parents, and should have done so  earlier, but it has been in circulation among many of my friends who  feel interested in the subject. Whatever may be thought of the  question as to where we should begin, all concur in acknowledging the  truth of your conclusions as to the value and use of the knowledge we  wish to impart, and in admiring the language and sentiment of your  Address.    There are some passages of great beauty, which I wish all persons  could read and remember; and I do not recollect ever having seen one  that has pleased me more, for its truths and elegance, than that  beginning, \"But if a manufacturing population.\" That which begins  with--\"The views, young men, as to the true object and ends to be  attained,\" is no less truthful and excellent.    It is unfortunate that the education which we have to supplant in  India is so blended with the religion of the people, as far as  Hindoos are concerned, that we cannot"]]]
