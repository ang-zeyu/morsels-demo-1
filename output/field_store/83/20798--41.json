No writer should send  an article to a publication before he has examined critically several of  its latest issues. In fact, no writer should prepare an article before  deciding to just what periodical he wishes to submit it. The more  familiar he is with the periodical the better are his chances of having  his contribution accepted.    In analyzing a newspaper or magazine in order to determine the type of  reader to which it appeals, the writer should consider the character of  the subjects in its recent issues, and the point of view from which  these subjects are presented. Every successful periodical has a distinct  individuality, which may be regarded as an expression of the editor's  idea of what his readers expect of his publication. To become a  successful contributor to a periodical, a writer must catch the spirit  that pervades its fiction and its editorials, as well as its special  articles.    In his effort to determine the kind of topics preferred by a given  publication, a writer may at first glance decide that timeliness is the  one element that dominates their choice, but a closer examination of the  articles in one or more issues will reveal a more specific basis of  selection. Thus, one Sunday paper will be found to contain articles on  the latest political, sociological, and literary topics, while another  deals almost exclusively with society leaders, actors and actresses, and  other men and women whose recent experiences or adventures have brought  them into prominence.    It is of even greater value to find out by careful reading of the entire  contents of several numbers of a periodical, the exact point of view  from which the material is treated. Every editor aims to present the  contents of his publication in the way that will make the strongest  appeal to his readers. This point of view it is the writer's business to  discover and adopt.    ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL ARTICLES. An inexperienced writer who desires to  submit special feature stories to newspapers should begin by analyzing  thoroughly the stories of this type in the daily papers published in his  own section of the country. Usually in the Saturday or Sunday issues he  will find typical articles on topics connected with the city and with  the state or states in which the paper circulates. The advantage of  beginning his study of newspaper stories with those published in papers  near his home lies in the fact that he is familiar with the interests of  the readers of these papers and can readily understand their point of  view. By noting the subjects, the point of view, the form, the style,  the length, and the illustrations, he will soon discover what these  papers want, or rather, what the readers of these papers want. The  \"Outline for the Analysis of Special Articles\" in Part II will indicate  the points to keep in mind in studying these articles.    In order to get a broader knowledge of the scope and character of  special feature stories, a writer may well extend his studies to the  magazine sections of the leading papers of the country. From the work of  the most experienced and original of the feature writers, which is  generally to be found in these metropolitan papers, the novice will  derive no little inspiration as well as a valuable knowledge of  technique.    The methods suggested for analyzing special feature stories in  newspapers are applicable also to the study of magazine articles.  Magazines afford a better opportunity than do newspapers for an analysis  of the different types of articles discussed in Chapter V. Since  magazine articles are usually signed, it is possible to seek out and  study the work of various successful authors in order to determine  wherein lies the effectiveness of their writing. Beginning with the  popular weekly and monthly magazines, a writer may well extend his study  to those periodicals that appeal to particular classes, such as women's  magazines, agricultural journals, and trade publications.    IDEALS IN FEATURE WRITING. After thoughtful analysis of special articles  in all kinds of newspapers and magazines, the young writer with a  critical sense developed by reading English literature may come to feel  that much of the writing in periodicals falls far short of the standards  of excellence established by the best authors. Because he finds that the  average uncritical reader not only accepts commonplace work but is  apparently attracted by meretricious devices in writing, he may conclude  that high literary standards are not essential to popular success. The  temptation undoubtedly is great both for editors and writers to supply  articles that are no better than the average reader demands, especially  in such ephemeral publications as newspapers and popular magazines.  Nevertheless, the writer who yields to this temptation is sure to  produce only mediocre work. If he is satisfied to write articles that  will be characterized merely as \"acceptable,\" he will never attain  distinction.    The special feature writer owes it both to himself and to his readers to  do the best work of which he is capable. It is his privilege not only to  inform and to entertain the public, but to create better taste and a  keener appreciation of good writing. That readers do not demand better  writing in their newspapers and magazines does not mean that they are  unappreciative of good work. Nor do originality and precision in style  necessarily \"go over the heads\" of the average person. Whenever writers  and editors give the public something no better than it is willing to  accept, they neglect a great opportunity to aid in the development of  better literary taste, particularly on the part of the public whose  reading is largely confined to newspapers and periodicals.    Because of the commercial value of satisfying his readers, an editor  occasionally assumes that he must give all of them whatever some of them  crave. \"We are only giving the public what it wants,\" is his excuse for  printing fiction and articles that are obviously demoralizing in their  effect. A heterogeneous public inevitably includes a considerable number  of individuals who are attracted by a suggestive treatment of morbid  phases of life. To cater to the low desires of some readers, on the  ground of \"giving the public what it wants,\" will always be regarded by  self-respecting editors and authors as indefensible.    The writer's opportunity to influence the mental, moral, and aesthetic  ideals of hundreds of thousands of readers is much greater than he often  realizes. When he considers the extent to which most men and women are  unconsciously guided in their ideas and aspirations by what they read in  newspapers and magazines, he cannot fail to appreciate his  responsibility. Grasping the full significance of his special feature  writing, he will no longer be content to write just well enough to sell  his product, but will determine to devote his effort to producing  articles that are the best of which he is capable.          CHAPTER III    FINDING SUBJECTS AND MATERIAL      SOURCES OF SUBJECTS. \"What shall I write about?\" is the first question  that inexperienced writers ask their literary advisers. \"If you haven't  anything to write about, why write at all?\" might be an easy answer.  Most persons, as a matter of fact, have plenty to write about but do not  realize it. Not lack of subjects, but inability to recognize the  possibilities of what lies at hand, is their real difficulty.    The best method of finding subjects is to look at every person, every  event, every experience--in short, at everything--with a view to seeing  whether or not it has possibilities for a special feature article. Even  in the apparently prosaic round of everyday life will be found a variety  of themes. A circular letter from a business firm announcing a new  policy, a classified advertisement in a newspaper, the complaint of a  scrub-woman, a new variety of fruit in the grocer's window, an increase  in the price of laundry work, a hurried luncheon at a cafeteria--any of  the hundred and one daily experiences may suggest a \"live\" topic for an  article.    \"Every foot of ground is five feet deep with subjects; all you have to  do is to scratch the surface for one,\" declared the editor of a popular  magazine who is also a successful writer of special articles. This  statement may be taken as literally true. Within the narrow confines of  one's house and yard, for instance, are many topics. A year's experience  with the family budget, a home-made device, an attempt to solve the  servant problem, a method of making pin-money, a practical means of  economizing in household management, are forms of personal experience  that may be made interesting to newspaper and magazine readers. A garden  on a city lot, a poultry house in a back yard, a novel form of garage,  a new use for a gasoline engine, a labor-saving device on the farm, may  afford equally good topics. One's own experience, always a rich field,  may be supplemented by experiences of neighbors and friends.    A second source of subjects is the daily newspaper. Local news will give  the writer clues that he can follow up by visiting the places mentioned,  interviewing the persons concerned, and gathering other relevant  material. When news comes from a distance, he can write to the persons  most likely to have the desired information. In neither case can he be  sure, until he has investigated, that an item of news will prove to  contain sufficient available material for an article. Many pieces of  news, however, are worth running down carefully, for the day's events  are rich in possibilities.    Pieces of news as diverse as the following may suggest excellent  subjects for special articles: the death of an interesting person, the  sale of a building that has historic associations, the meeting of an  uncommon group or organization, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#6)"],[1,"puzzlement, \"is a chock on the forepart of the lowermast on which the  'eel--heel, miss, of the topmast rests.  Yuss, sir.  Her knee may 'ave  water in it; but no one couldn't say the same of her _grog_.\"    To prevent death from combustion, the speechless captain here intimated  by signs that the culprit should stand up.  And the brindle of Rodney  Stone strain stood, whilst the men's eyes glistened as they fidgeted  upon their feet from very joy in the spectacle.    His skull was massive and perfectly-shaped, the under-jaw square and  strong, thrust up and beyond the upper; the teeth were perfect, even,  large and also strong; the nose was black and large, well back between  the eyes, which were set low down and wide apart, but well in front and  round, with a deep \"stop\" between them; the honestest outward sign of  his gallant loving heart.  The ears were rose; not in colour, of  course, but of rose-leaf shape, set high and small and fine; the face  was closely-wrinkled, the \"chop\" well down, and the loose skin in  abundant folds about his throat and neck.    The chest was wide and deep and prominent; the shoulders were  tremendously muscular; the body was short, with a Roach back, fine in  the rear; the forelegs, short and strong, with the developed calves  which give them the appearance of being bowed, whereas the bones are  really straight; the feet turned out a bit, with toes split up and  arched; the tail set low and straight down and anything but a glad  tail.  His heart was of the finest, honest, loving, courageous, capable  of hurling its owner to instant battle or death, in defence of the one  loved, at other times rendering him, in its gentleness, an almost  ludicrous spectacle of adoration.  Of such was Wellington, and if the  description is somewhat detailed and technical it is because he happens  a good deal into the book.    The duchess had been put into the train for Port Said by Ben Kelham,  who, inwardly kicking at her sage advice, looked as despondent as a  camel who considers its strength unequal to its burden.    \"Cheer up, lad,\" she cried as the train moved off.  \"Cheer up;  something is sure to happen before long.\"    Which was a perfectly safe prophecy to make where Damaris was concerned.    Arrived at Port Said, she put off in a boat with her maid and her  parrot, and found her godchild, who did not expect her, on deck,  entranced with all she saw.    Yes! of course Port Said is a sink of iniquity and a place of odours  and a fold for native wolves in sheep's clothing; also a centre for  antiquities made in Birmingham, or by the vendor himself in the hot  weather; and a market for things which should not be sold, much less  bought.    In fact, in one short sentence, it is a deal of cosmopolitan  wrong-doing.    All the same, you need not buy and you need not listen nor look, and if  it is the first bit of the Orient you have meet with for the first time  in your life, well! it is the East, and jolly exciting and interesting,  too.    Damaris rushed at the old lady, and having curtsied to her, gathered  her up in her strong arms and hugged her tightly, just as Captain X,  who during one trip had had the duchess as passenger and therefore  loved her, came along.    As they turned in the direction of the dining-saloon, the girl looked  over her shoulder at the two maids, and smiled.    With a great love of their respective mistresses as their sole bond in  common they stood, otherwise divided, staring at each other.    \"Pleased to meet you again,\" volunteered country-bred Jane, offering a  plump hand.    \"Hoping you are in good health,\" responded Maria Hobson, making a  corner in strawberry-leaves as she just touched the finger-tips.    \"Wellington, you have met Dekko, I think,\" laughed the girl.    \"Woomph!\" grunted the dog disdainfully, as he cocked an eye at the  bird, which ruffled its feathers, spread its red tail and looked down  sideways and spitefully for a long moment.    \"My Gawd!\" it suddenly shrieked.  \"My Gawd!\"    And it swung about and rubbed its soft grey pate against its mistress's  outrageous golden perruque, then hurled itself onto the captain's  shoulder.          CHAPTER V.      \"_Oh, yet we trust that somehow good    Will be the final goal of ill_.\"              TENNYSON.      After the fight in the bazaar, the ducal party stayed for another  fortnight in Cairo, during which time Damaris saw as much of the place  and its surroundings as she could in fourteen days and a few hours out  of each of the fourteen nights; whilst her godmother played bridge or  poker, paid and received visits, took her to dances and parties, and  busied her fingers in the tangled threads Fate had tossed into her lap.    It was an understood thing that the girl should be ready to conduct the  old aristocrat to the dining-room at the dinner-hour and give her the  evening; other than that her time was her own, though, owing to her  innate courtesy and her love for her godmother, she never once absented  herself without having obtained permission.    \"You are a positive tonic, child, in these perplexing days,\" remarked  her grace, when the girl had concluded the recital of the fight in the  bazaar.  \"Only, do remember to come straight to me if ever you get into  a real scrape.\"    And that night, the old lady, who had lost heavily at poker, fairly  snapped at Maria Hobson, who, tucking her up in bed, remarked, greatly  daring, upon the amount of liberty allowed the child.    \"Don't be foolish, my good woman,\" she said, \"and do for goodness' sake  mind your business of looking after me.  Although my god-daughter may  bluff a bit for the fun of the game, and get let down a bit for her own  good, yet I shouldn't advise anyone to get seeing her too often.  Fate  dealt her a royal straight flush in hearts, and better that you  can't--no! not even if you hold a full house of intrigue and bad intent  t'other end of Life's table.\"    \"Humff!\" replied the maid heavily through her nose, not having  understood one word of her mistress's admonition.    Each day at breakfast and at dinner a bunch, big or little, of simple  or hothouse flowers lay beside the girl's plate, without name or  message.    Now, the finding of flowers upon your table does not, in Egypt,  necessarily imply that the donor thereof is a son of the desert; the  maitre d'hotel has been known to do it out of deference to your rank or  purse; and only once had Jane Coop had the mixed pleasure of meeting  the deaf-mute Nubian who daily left the posies at the hotel.    Refreshed from her siesta, she had descended to the hall _via_ the  stairs instead of the lift, and bumped into the ebony-hued slave as he  bent to lay a sheaf of flowers upon the matting outside her mistress's  door.    He had straightened himself and salaamed almost to the ground--which  had delighted Jane Coop--and had offered the bunch to her.    \"Oh, no, my man!\" she had said, bridling, \"you don't come over me that  way.  Just you take that trash back to where it came from.  My young  lady ain't that kind,\" and had shaken her fist in his face and flounced  downstairs to lay a complaint.    What with the militant maids, the parrot and the dog, the ducal party  was continually breaking out in some direction or another, but the  maitre d'hotel, who simply worshipped the old lady, merely smiled and  poured the oil of soothing words upon the troubled waters.    The girl had quite casually recounted the fight in the bazaar, and the  wise old woman had made no comment; but, all the same, next day she  indifferently asked a few questions of Lady Thistleton, who had a big  heart, narrow mind, an ever-wagging tongue and two daughters.    \"Oh, that's the son of the Arab and the English girl.  You must  remember the fuse there was in England over the runaway marriage--what  was her name?--how she could, you know----\"    \"Ah! yes.  You must be talking of Jill Carden.  I knew her very well.  Naughty girl, she refused the invitation I sent them asking them to  come to England and stay with me, and gave up writing to me after a  while.  Does she live in Cairo?\"    It seemed that Jill, the wife of the Sheikh el-Umbar, lived in the Flat  Oasis t'other side of the Canal, in Arabia proper, but, according to  current gossip, was at the moment upon a visit to her son at the House  'an Mahabbha, which had been built for the elder branch of the House  el-Umbar on a verdant patch watered by the springs, from the limestone  hills which stretch on the desert side of the Oasis of Khargegh.    \"He's not in Cairo, then?\"    \"No; he left to-day,\" replied the gossip.  \"You see, his mother is  expected any time at his home, if she isn't already there.  My maid  will chatter so, there's absolutely no stopping her.  Funnily enough, I  arrived at the station as he was leaving in a special train.  Such a  handsome man, educated in England, millionaire too.  Of course it's a  case of a touch of the tarbrush--such a pity, too!\"    The duchess suddenly shivered.    \"Little Jill!\" she said gently.  \"Little Jill!  I must go and see her  if she will let me.  Ah!  General, what about a hand at ecarte before  dinner?\"--and she rose with a stormy rustling of her softly-scented  silks, leaving the gossip wondering in what way she had put her foot in  it.    That night, as she lay like a little brown mouse under the  mosquito-net, watching the stars through the open window, the old lady  suddenly decided to bestir herself.    \"It's too risky!  She's too beautiful, too young and unsophisticated,\"  she murmured as she lit a cigarette under the curtains, which is  strictly against the rules.  \"I'd bet my last _piastre_ that Jill  Carden's son's all right, but, all the same, one has to reckon with the  glamour of the East.  Love's all very well in a cool climate, but it's  the dickens out here.  Must get her anchored in safe waters.  What  d'you think, Dekko old friend?  What course shall I set?  Shall we go  home,"]]]
