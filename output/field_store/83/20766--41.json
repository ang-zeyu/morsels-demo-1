For headdresses, tatting  cotton No. 80; tatting-pin No. 2.    The square is composed first of nine 4-branched patterns, worked in 3  rows of 3 patterns each, and joined on one to the other with purl. Each  pattern consists of 4 branches close to each other, and each branch  consists of 7 double, 1 purl, 7 double; when the 4 branches of one  pattern are completed, cut off the cotton, and fasten both ends  together so as to form a small circle in the centre. Then work a second  pattern, which is fastened on to the first and second branches of the  first pattern, instead of working the purl stitch; work a third pattern,  which is fastened in the same manner on to the second pattern. Then work  2 more rows exactly the same as can be seen in illustration.    [Illustration: 33.--Tatted Square.]    *For the border of the square, fasten the cotton on the first purl of  the first pattern, work 4 double, 13 purl divided by 2 double, 4 double,  draw up the stitches close, fasten the cotton again on to the same purl  of the first pattern *, and work the following scallop at a short  distance:--4 double fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle,  10 purl divided by 2 double, 4 double, draw up the stitch, leaving an  interval of two-fifths of an inch between the first and the last; fasten  the cotton on to the next purl which joins two patterns, repeat twice  more from *, and continue to repeat from *.           *       *       *       *       *    34.--_Tatted Rosette_.

Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40;  tatting-pin No. 2.    [Illustration: 36.--Diamond in Tatting.]    This diamond is suitable for trimming collars, cuffs, &c., when worked  with fine cotton. Work first the four corner patterns separately, as  follows:--7 double, 3 purl divided by 3 double, 6 double, join the  stitches into a circle, work close to this circle a second one  consisting of 6 double fastened on the last purl of the 1st circle, 4  double, 2 purl divided by 4 double, 6 double; then a 3rd circle  consisting of 6 double fastened on the last purl of the preceding  circle, 3 double, 2 purl divided by 3 double, 7 double. Take a second  shuttle, fasten the cotton on the end of the cotton of the 1st circle,  throw the cotton of the 1st shuttle over the fingers of the left hand,  and work with this cotton over the cotton on the other shuttle in the  right hand. Work 5 double, and then one circle as follows with the  cotton in the left hand only:--8 double fastened on the last purl of the  3rd of the 3 circles worked close to each other, 5 double, 1 purl, 5  double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 6 double, then again over the cotton  on the other shuttle, 5 double, 4 purl divided by 5 double, 5 double,  then with one shuttle only one circle as follows:--6 double, 1 purl, 4  double, 1 purl, 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double fastened on 1st purl of the  circle worked at the beginning, 8 double; then again with two shuttles 5  double. Fasten the cotton on the piece of cotton before the 5 double  worked with two shuttles, so that the stitches worked over two shuttles  form a circle, and cut off the cotton. When three of these patterns have  been worked, work the centre pattern of the square. It consists of 4  leaves touching each other at the lower points; each leaf is formed of 3  double, 5 purl divided by 3 double, 3 double; each following leaf is  fastened on to the preceding one at the place of the 1st purl. Then work  first 1 round of the oval circles of the square, with which the corner  patterns are joined. Fasten the cotton on one purl of one corner  pattern, make 7 double, 1 purl, 8 double; fasten on the corresponding  purl of another corner pattern, work 8 double, 1 purl, 7 double, join  the stitches into a circle, fasten the cotton on to the same purl to  which the cotton has already been fastened, carry the latter on to the  next purl of the same corner pattern, fasten it, then work three more  circles like the first, which are fastened on to each preceding circle,  at the place of the first purl; fasten the cotton on the two cross purl  of the centre pattern, and work four similar circles on the other side  of the same. The 8 circles which go across the square in the opposite  direction are worked in the same manner. When the square is completed,  draw two threads on each side of each corner pattern on to the other  side of the square along the cotton which joins the circles together.           *       *       *       *       *    37.--_Tatting for Cap Crown_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 100;  tatting-pin No. 1.    [Illustration: 37.--Tatting for Cap Crown.]    This pattern is very pretty for the crown of a cap like the one  described on page 36, and also for covers, toilet cushions, &c. The size  of the cotton depends upon the use you wish to make of the pattern. The  pattern is worked with fine tatting cotton. It consists of  eight-branched rosettes joined together with small circles. Each rosette  is worked as follows: Work 8 loops or branches close to each other,  consisting of 7 double, 1 purl, 7 double; fasten both ends of the  cotton together, and cut them off. Each of the small circles which joins  the rosettes together consists of 2 double, 8 purl divided by 2 double.  It is easy to see from the illustration how the patterns are joined  together by means of the purl stitches.           *       *       *       *       *    38 _and_ 39.--_Cap in Tatting_.

The problem accordingly has been handed over from the vocational  counselors to the experimental psychologists, and it is certainly in  the spirit of the modern tendency toward applied psychology that the  psychological laboratories undertake the investigation and withdraw it  from the dilettantic discussion of amateur psychologists or the mere  impressionism of the school-teachers. Even those early beginnings  indicate clearly that the goal can be reached only through exact,  scientific, experimental research, and that the mere naive  methods--for instance, the filling-out of questionnaires which may be  quite useful in the first approach--cannot be sufficient for a real,  persistent furtherance of economic life and of the masses who seek  their vocations. In order to gain an analysis of the individual,  Parsons made every applicant answer in writing a long series of  questions which referred to his habits and his emotions, his  inclinations and his expectations, his traits and his experiences. The  psychologist, however, can hardly be in doubt that just the mental  qualities which ought to be most important for the vocational  counselor can scarcely be found out by such methods. We have  emphasized before that the ordinary individual knows very little of  his own mental functions: on the whole, he knows them as little as he  knows the muscles which be uses when he talks or walks. Among his  questions Parsons included such ones as: \"Are your manners quiet,  noisy, boisterous, deferential, or self-assertive? Are you thoughtful  of the comfort of others? Do you smile naturally and easily, or is  your face ordinarily expressionless? Are you frank, kindly, cordial,  respectful, courteous in word and actions? Do you look people frankly  in the eye? Are your inflections natural, courteous, modest, musical,  or aggressive, conceited, pessimistic, repellent? What are your powers  of attention, observation, memory, reason, imagination, inventiveness,  thoughtfulness, receptiveness, quickness, analytical power,  constructiveness, breadth, grasp? Can you manage people well? Do you  know a fine picture when you see it? Is your will weak, yielding,  vacillating, or firm, strong, stubborn? Do you like to be with people  and do they like to be with you?\"--and so on. It is clear that the  replies to questions of this kind can be of psychological value only  when the questioner knows beforehand the mind of the youth, and can  accordingly judge with what degree of understanding, sincerity, and  ability the circular blanks have been filled out. But as the questions  are put for the very purpose of revealing the personality, the entire  effort tends to move in a circle.    To break this circle, it indeed becomes necessary to emancipate one's  self from the method of ordinary self-observation and to replace it by  objective experiment in the psychological laboratory. Experimentation  in such a laboratory stands in no contrast to the method of  introspection. A contrast does exist between self-observation and  observation on children or patients or primitive peoples or animals.  In their case the psychologist observes his material from without. But  in the case of the typical laboratory experiment, everything is  ultimately based on self-observation; only we have to do with the  self-observation under exact conditions which the experimenter is able  to control and to vary at will. Even Parsons sometimes turned to  little experimental inquiries in which he simplified some well-known  methods of the laboratory in order to secure with the most elementary  means a certain objective foundation for his mental analysis. For  instance, he sometimes examined the memory by reading to the boys  graded sentences containing from ten to fifty words and having them  repeat what they remembered, or he measured with a watch the rapidity  of reading and writing, or he determined the sensitiveness for the  discrimination of differences by asking them to make a point with a  pencil in the centres of circles of various sizes. But if such  experimental schemes, even of the simplest form, are in question, it  seems a matter of course that the plan ought to be prescribed by real  scientists who specialize in the psychological field. The  psychologist, for instance, surely cannot agree to a method which  measures the memory by such a method of having spoken sentences  repeated and the quality of the memory faculty naively graded  according to the results. He knows too well that there are many  different kinds of memory, and would always determine first which type  of memory functions is to be examined if memory achievements are  needed for a particular calling.    But even with a more exact method of experimenting, such a procedure  would not be sufficient to solve the true problem. A second step would  still be necessary: namely, the adaptation of the experimental result  to the special psychological requirements of the economic activity;  and this again presupposes an independent psychological analysis. Most  of the previous efforts have suffered from the carelessness with which  this second step was ignored, and the special mental requirements were  treated as a matter of course upon which any layman could judge. In  reality they need the most careful psychological analysis, and only if  this is carried out with the means of scientific psychology, can a  study of the abilities of the individual become serviceable to the  demands of the market. Such a psychological disentangling of the  requirements of the callings, in the interest of guidance, is  attempted in the material which the various vocational institutes have  prepared, but it seldom goes beyond commonplaces. We read there, for  instance,[5] for the confectioner: \"Boys in this industry must be  clean, quick, and strong. The most important qualities desired are  neatness and adaptability to routine\"; or, for the future baker, the  boy \"ought to know how to conduct himself and to meet the public\"; or  for the future architectural designer, \"he must have creative ability,  artistic feeling, and power to sketch\"; or for the dressmaker, she  \"should have good eyesight and good sense of color, and an ability to  use her hands readily; she should be able to apply herself steadily  and be fairly quick in her movements; neatness of person is also  essential\"; or for the stenographer, she must be \"possessed of  intelligence, good judgment, and common sense; must have good  eyesight, good hearing, and a good memory; must have quick perception,  and be able to concentrate her attention completely on any matter in  hand.\" It is evident that all this is extremely far from any  psychological analysis in the terms of science. All taken together, we  may, therefore, say that in the movement for vocational guidance  practically nothing has been done to make modern experimental  psychology serviceable to the new task. But on the one side, it has  shown that this work of the experimental psychologist is the next step  necessary. On the other side, it has become evident that in the  vocation bureaus appropriate social agencies are existing which are  ready to take up the results of such work, and to apply them for the  good of the American youth and of commerce and industry, as soon as  the experimental psychologist has developed the significant methods.          VI    SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT      Before we discuss some cases of such experimental investigations, we  may glance at that other American movement, the well-known systematic  effort toward scientific management which has often been interpreted  in an expansive literature.[6] Enthusiastic followers have declared it  to be the greatest advance in industry since the introduction of the  mill system and of machinery. Opponents have hastily denounced it as a  mistake, and have insisted that it proved a failure in the factories  in which it has been introduced. A sober examination of the facts soon  demonstrates that the truth lies in the middle. Those followers of  Frederick W. Taylor who have made almost a religion out of his ideas  have certainly often exaggerated the practical applicability of the  new theories, and their actual reforms in the mills have not seldom  shown that the system is still too topheavy; that is, there are too  many higher employees necessary in order to keep the works running on  principles of scientific management. On the other hand, the opposition  which comes from certain quarters,--for instance, from some  trade-unions,--may be disregarded, as it is not directed against the  claim that the efficiency can be heightened, but only against some  social features of the scheme, such as the resulting temporary  reduction of the number of workmen. But nobody can deny that this  revolutionary movement has introduced most valuable suggestions which  the industrial world cannot afford to ignore, and that as soon as  exaggerations are avoided and experience has created a broader  foundation, the principles of the new theory will prove of lasting  value. We shall have to discuss, at a later point, various special  features of the system, especially the highly interesting motion  study. Here we have to deal only with those tendencies of the movement  and with those interests which point toward our present problem, the  mental analysis of the individual employees in order to avoid misfits.    The approach to this problem, indeed, seems unavoidable for the  students of scientific management, as its goal is an organization of  economic work by which the waste of energy will be avoided and the  greatest increase in the efficiency of the industrial enterprise will  be reached. The recognition that this can never be effected by a mere  excessive driving of the workingmen belongs to its very  presuppositions. The illusory means of prolongation of the"]]]
