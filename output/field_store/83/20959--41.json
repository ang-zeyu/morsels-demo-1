I just don't know!\" The captain grunted as he adjusted  his pack and started on.    If fortune had failed them earlier, she smiled on them now. Asaki  discovered a cave before sundown, located not too far from a mountain  stream. The Ranger sniffed the air before that dark opening as the  Hunter pilot shed his equipment and crept forward on his hands and  knees, his head up and his nostrils expanding as he, too, tested the  scent from the cave mouth.    Scent? It was closer to a stench, and one ripe enough to turn the  stomach of an off-worlder. But the Hunter glanced back over his shoulder  and nodded reassuringly.    \"Lion. But old. Not here within five days at least.\"    \"Well enough. And even old lion scent will keep away rock apes. We'll  clean some and then we can rest undisturbed,\" was his superior's  comment.    The cleaning was easy for the brittle bedding of dried bracken and grass  the beast had left burned quickly, cleansing with both fire and smoke.  When they raked the ashes out with branches, Asaki and Nymani brought in  handfuls of leaves which they crumpled and threw on the floor, spreading  an aromatic odor which banished most of the foulness.    Dane, at the stream with the canteens to fill, chanced upon a small pool  where there was a spread of smooth yellow sand. Knowing well the many  weird booby traps one might stumble into on a strange world, the Terran  prospected carefully, stirring up the stand with a stick. Sighting not  so much as a water insect or a curious fish, he pulled off his boots,  rolled up his breeches and waded in. The water was cool and refreshing,  though he dared not drink it until the purifier was added. Then, with  the filled canteens knotted together by their straps, he put on his  boots and climbed to the cave where Tau waited with water tablets.    Half an hour later Dane sat cross-legged by the fire, turning a spit  strung with three small birds Asaki had brought in. One foot closer to  the heat began to tingle and he eased off his boot; his cramped toes  suddenly seeming to have doubled in size. He was staring wide-eyed at  these same toes, puffed, red, and increasingly painful to the touch,  when Nymani squatted beside him, inspected his foot closely, and ordered  him to take off his other boot.    \"What is it?\" Dane found that shedding the other boot was a minor  torture in itself.    Nymani was cutting tiny splinters, hardly thicker than a needle, from a  stick.    \"Sand worm--lays eggs in flesh. We burn them out or you have bad foot.\"    \"Burn them out!\" Dane echoed, and then swallowed as he watched Nymani  advance a splinter to the fire.    \"Burn them,\" the Khatkan repeated firmly. \"Burn tonight, hurt some  tomorrow; all well soon. No burn--very bad.\"    Dane ruefully prepared to pay the consequences of his first brush with  the unpleasant surprises Khatka had to offer.          IV      Dane regarded his throbbing feet morosely. Nymani's operations with  burning splinters had been hard to take, but he had endured them without  disgracing himself before the Khatkans, who appeared to regard such a  mishap as just another travel incident. Now, with Tau's salve soothing  the worst of the after affects, the Terran was given time to reflect  upon his own stupidity and the fact that he might now prove a drag on  the whole party the next morning.    \"That's queer....\"    Dane was startled out of the contemplation of his misery to see the  medic on his knees before their row of canteens, the vial of water  purifier held to the firelight for a closer inspection.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"We must have hit with a pretty hard thump back there. Some of these  pills are powder! Have to guess about the portion to add.\" With the tip  of his knife blade Tau scraped a tiny amount of pill fragments into each  waiting canteen. \"That should do it. But if the water tastes a little  bitter, don't let it bother you.\"    Bitter water, Dane thought, trying to flex his still swollen toes, was  going to be the least of his worries in the morning. But he determined  that his boots should go on at daybreak, and he would keep on his feet  as long as the others did, no matter how much it cost him.    And when they set out shortly after daybreak, wanting to move as far as  they could before the heat hours when they must rest, the going was not  too bad. Dane's feet were tender to the touch, but he could shuffle  along at the tail of the procession with only Nymani playing rear guard  behind him.    Jungle lay before them and bush knives began to swing, clearing their  path. Dane took his turn with the rest at that chore, thankful that the  business of cutting their way through that mass of greenery slowed them  to a pace he could match--if not in comfort, then by willpower.    But the sand worms were not the only troubles one could encounter on  Khatka. Within an hour Captain Jellico stood sweating and speaking his  mind freely in the native tongues of five different planets while Tau  and Nymani worked as a team with skinning knives. They were not flaying  the spaceman, but they came near to that in places as they worried a  choice selection of tree thorns out of his arm and shoulder. The captain  had been unfortunate enough to trip and fall into the embrace of a very  unfriendly bush.    Dane inspected a fallen tree for evidence of inimical wild life, and  then rested his blanket between him and it as a protecting cushion  before he sat down. These trees were not the towering giants of the true  forests, but rather oversized bushes which had been made into walls by  twined vines. Brilliant bursts of flowers were splotches of vivid color,  and the attendant insect life was altogether too abundant. Dane tried to  tally his immunity shots and hoped for the best. At the moment he  wondered why anyone would want to visit Khatka, let alone pay some  astronomical sum for the privilege. Though he could also guess that the  plush safari arranged for a paying client might be run on quite  different lines from their own present trek.    How _could_ a tracker find his way through this? With the compasses  playing crazy tricks into the bargain! Jellico knew that the compasses  were off, yet the captain had followed Asaki's lead without question, so  he must trust the Ranger's forest craft. But Dane wished they were clear  on the mountain side again.    Time had little meaning in that green gloom. But when they worked  through to meet rock walls again, the sun said it was well into the  after part of the day. They sheltered for a breather under the drooping  limbs of one of the last trees.    \"Amazing!\" Jellico, his torn arm in a sling across his chest, came  down-slope from the higher point where he had been using the distance  lenses. \"We struck straight across and cut off about ten miles by that  jungle jog. Now I believe all that I've heard of your people's ability  to cross wilderness and not lose their built in 'riding beams,' sir.  With the compasses out, I'll admit I've been nourishing a healthy set of  doubts.\"    Asaki laughed. \"Captain, I do not question your ability to flit from  world to world, or how you have learned to set up trade with strange  humans and non-humans alike. To each his own mystery. On Khatka every  boy before he becomes a man must learn to navigate the jungle, and with  no instruments to help him, only what lies in here.\" He touched his  thumb to his forehead. \"So through generations we have developed our  homing instincts. Those who did not, also did not live to father others  who might have had the same lack. We are hounds who can run on a scent,  and we are migrators who have better than a compass within our own  bodies.\"    \"Now we take to climbing again?\" Tau surveyed the way before them  critically.    \"Not at this hour. That sun on the upward slopes can cook a man's skin  were he to touch any rock. We wait....\"    Waiting for the Khatkans was a chance to sleep. They curled up on their  light blankets. But the three spacemen were restless. Dane would have  liked to have taken off his boots, but feared he could not replace them;  and he could tell from the way the captain shifted his position that  Jellico was in pain too. Tau sat quietly, staring at nothing Dane could  see, unless it was a tall rock thrust out of the slope like a finger  pointing skyward.    \"What color is that rock?\"    Surprised, Dane gave the stony finger closer attention. To him it was  the same color as most of the other rocks, a weathered black which in  certain lights appeared to carry a brownish film.    \"Black, or maybe dark brown?\"    Tau looked past him to Jellico. The captain nodded.    \"I'd agree with that.\"    Tau cupped his hands over his eyes for a moment and his lips moved as if  he were counting. Then he took his hands away and stared up-slope. Dane  watched the medic's eyelids blink slowly. \"Nothing but black or brown?\"  Tau pressed.    \"No.\" Jellico supported his injured arm upon his knees, leaning forward,  as intent upon the designated rock as if he expected it to assume some  far more startling appearance.    \"Queer,\" Tau said to himself, and then added briskly, \"You're right, of  course. That sun can play tricks with one's eyes.\"    Dane continued to watch the finger rock. Maybe strong sunlight could  play tricks, but he could see nothing odd about that rough lump. And  since the captain asked no questions of Tau, he did not quite want to  either.    It was perhaps a half-hour later, and the medic and Jellico had both  succumbed to the quiet, the heat, and their own fatigue, when Dane did  sight a movement up-slope. The throbbing in his feet was worse now that  he had nothing to occupy his mind but his own troubles, and he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#6)"],[1,"shelter which runs round the little house is filled on a summer night  with men, all in dress-clothes, and ladies in flowered or feathered  hats. The world and the half-world dine at adjacent tables, and neither  section of Paris objects. The tables are decorated with flowers, and two  bands, which play alternately, make music so softly that it does not  interfere with conversation. The cooking is good, and the prices are  rather high. There are tables under the trees surrounding the building,  and some people dine at these; but \"all Paris\" seems to prefer to be  squeezed into the least possible space under the glass verandah.    At the Chateau de Madrid the tables are set under the trees in the  courtyard of the building, and the effect of the dimly seen buildings,  the dark foliage, and the lights is very striking. The Madrid has always  been an expensive place to dine at, but its reputation for cookery is  good. Last year I dined at the Chateau one hot summer's night and found  there M. Aubanel, who had left his little hotel at Monte Carlo, during  the great heats, to take temporary command at the Madrid, striving to  serve a great crowd of diners with an insufficient staff of waiters. I  trust that the proprietors have made better arrangements since to meet  any sudden inrush of guests. The Madrid has a capital cellar of wine.    On a race-morning I have eaten a little breakfast, well enough served,  at the restaurant of the Cafe de la Cascade.      Supping-Places    The fickle Parisian crowd changes its supping-places without any  apparent cause. A few hundred francs spent in gilding a ceiling, a  quarrel between two damsels in gigantic hats as to which of them ordered  a particular table to be reserved, and the whole cloud of butterflies  rises to settle elsewhere. Julien's, Sylvain's, La Rue's, the Cafe de La  Paix, Maire's, Paillard's all had their time when there was not a vacant  seat in their rooms at 1 A.M. Durand's, in the summer of '92, was the  society supping-place. At the Cafe de Paris, where M. Mourier, a former  _maitre-d'hotel_ of Maire's reigns, the British matron and the  travelling American gaze at the _haute cocotterie_--who patronise the  right fork of the room as you enter. At Maxim's, any gentleman may  conduct the band if he wishes to, and the tables are often cleared away  and a little impromptu dance organised. At the Cafe Americain, the  profession of the ladies who frequent it at supper-time is a little too  obvious. You should take your wife to Durand's. She will insist on going  to the Cafe de Paris. You should not take her to Maxim's, and you cannot  take her to the Americain. Of course, the supping-places I have  enumerated are but a few of the many, for there is no Early Closing Act  in France, every restaurant in Paris keeps open till 2 A.M., and some  later, and supper is to be had at all of them. Personally, I am never  happier at supper-time than when I am sitting in the back room at the  Taverne Pousset picking crayfish out of a wooden bowl where they swim  in savoury liquid, pulling them to pieces, and eating them as they were  eaten before forks and spoons put fingers out of fashion. The Restaurant  des Fleurs, the newest of the Parisian restaurants, in the Rue  St-Honore, is making a bid with its decoration in the \"new art\" style to  capture those who sup.      Miscellaneous    Since Cubat in dudgeon gave up his restaurant in the Avenue of the  Champs Elysees, there has been no prominent foreign restaurant in Paris.  Cubat, whose restaurant in St. Petersburg is so well known, brought  Russian cookery to Paris; but though the Parisians are fond enough of  cheering for the Dual Alliance, they did not dip into their pockets to  keep the Russian restaurant in existence. An expensive German  restaurant, a relic of the last exhibition, showed its lights just off  the great boulevards, but after a time disappeared. There are Viennese  restaurants on the boulevards and in the Rue d'Hauteville, and Spanish  and Italian establishments may be found by the curious who wish to  impair their digestion. The Englishman or American who has been feeding  on rich food for any length of time, often yearns for perfectly simple  food. At Henry's, at the Club Restaurant, and at most of the English and  American bars with which Paris is now studded, a chop is obtainable, and  a whisky and soda which is not poison; but I, personally, when _Pate de  Foie Gras_ becomes a horror, truffles a burden, and rich sauces an  abomination, go to one of the _Tavernes_, the Royale in the Rue Royale,  or the Anglais in the Rue Boissy d'Anglas (where you get Lucas's food at  lower prices than in the restaurant by the Madeleine), or into one of  the many houses of plain cookery on the boulevards, and order the  simplest and least greasy soup on the bill of fare, some plainly grilled  cutlets, and some green vegetables. A pint of the second or third claret  on the wine-card washes down this penitential repast. At Puloski's, an  uninviting-looking little establishment in the Rue St-Honore, I have  eaten excellent dishes of oysters cooked according to American methods,  and that dry hash which boarding-house keepers across the Atlantic are  supposed to serve perpetually to their paying guests, but which an  American abroad is always glad to meet. You will find a great variety of  oysters, Marennes, Ostendes, Zelandes, at Prunier's, in the Rue Duphot,  and the dishes of the house--soup, sole, steak--are all cooked with  oysters as a foundation, sauce, or garnish. Prunier's is the house at  which the travelling gourmet generally tastes his first snails, the  great Burgundian ones with striped shells, or the little gray fellows  from the champagne vineyards. If you eat Prunier's oysters you should  drink his white Burgundy. If you eat his snails, you should drink his  red wine, for he has some excellent red Burgundy.    Most travellers at least once in their lives go the round of Montmartre  and its Bohemian shows. I have dined with the great Fursy in the  restaurant attached to the Treteau de Tabarin, and was given good  substantial bourgeois cookery. I asked the singer of the \"Chansons  Rosses\" how it was that he, who girds at all things bourgeois and  commonplace, ran the restaurant on such simple and non-eccentric lines;  and he shrugged his shoulders, which I took to mean that you may trifle  with a man's intellect but not with his stomach. About two in the  morning, in the upstairs room at the Treteau, there is often some  amusement forward. Upstairs at the Rat Mort, you may dine in comfort  with _Soupe a l'Onion_ and _Tournedos Rat Mort_ in the menu; and at the  Abbaye de Theleme, and at the Restaurant Blanche in the place of that  name, you will find the artists and sculptors of the Butte.    In the Quartier, Thurion's in the Boulevard St-Germain is an interesting  restaurant for a wandering Anglo-Saxon to become acquainted with, for  there he will see most of the young Americans and English who are  climbing up the ladder of pictorial fame. It is a Parisian \"Cheshire  Cheese.\" The floors are sawdusted, the waiters rush about in hot haste,  and the chickens stray in from the courtyard at the back and pick up the  crumbs round the tables. The place has its traditions, and you can hear  tales of Dickens and Thackeray from the plump lady who makes up the  bills.      Good Cheap Restaurants    I feel tempted in connection with this heading to write as did the  naturalist of snakes in Iceland; but besides the _tavernes_ and  _bouillons_, which give wonderful value for the money spent but do not  require any lengthy mention in a book dealing with temples of the higher  art, there are one or two interesting _table-d'hote_ restaurants where  the meals are very cheap. One of these is Philippe's, on the first floor  of the Palais Royal, next door to the Petit Vefour, and another is the  Diner Francais, 27 Bd. des Italiens.      St-Germain    The Pavillion Henri IV., on the terrace of St-Germain, where every  travelling Briton and American breakfasts once during his summer stay in  Paris, is \"run\" by the management of the Champeaux, and one gets very  excellent cookery and service in consequence, the prices not being at  all exorbitant. One groans, sitting at the little tables on the terraces  and looking at the view, to think of the chances some of our hotels near  London, with even finer views, throw away through lack of enterprise.      St-Cloud    The Pavillion Bleu at St-Cloud, the proprietor of which, M. Moreaux,  bought the greater portion of the \"grands vins\" of the Maison d'Or,  deserves a special word of commendation.      N.N.-D.          CHAPTER II    FRENCH PROVINCIAL TOWNS         The northern ports--Norman and Breton towns--The west coast and       Bordeaux--Marseilles and the Riviera--The       Pyrenees--Provence--Aix-les-Bains and other \"cure\" places.      I propose to take you, my gastronomic reader, first on a little tour  round the coast of France from north-east round to south-east, pausing  at any port or any watering-place where there is any restaurant of any  mark, and then to make a few incursions inland.    Calais is, of course, our starting-place, and here my experience of  leaving the buffet at the Terminus and exploring in the town is that one  goes farther and does not fare so well. The buffet at Calais always has  had the reputation of being one of the best in Europe, and though the  Englishman new landed after a rough passage generally selects clear soup  and stewed chicken as his meal, it is quite possible to obtain an  admirably cooked lunch or dinner in the room off the restaurant; and the  cold viands, the cream cheese, the vegetables and fruit are all worthy  of attention. The \"wagons-restaurants\" which are attached now to most  of the express trains, no doubt have cut into the business of the buffet  restaurant; but as a contrast to the ordinary British station"]]]
