There is a colt with Farmer Knave's oxen.    NIX. I do not see him.    THIRD FARMER. He is lying down between them.    NIX. Ah, I see him now.    (_He goes to Farmer Knave._)    I have come for my colt, Farmer Knave.    KNAVE. Your colt?    NIX. Yes. There he is between your oxen.    KNAVE. He is my colt, sir.    NIX. How can he be your colt when he is mine?    KNAVE. I ask the same question, sir.    NIX. What do you mean?    KNAVE. How can the colt be yours when he is mine?    NIX. I'll have you before the judge, sir!    KNAVE. The judge shall speak to you, sir!    [_The_ PRINCE _comes from the castle._]    PRINCE. What is all this noise, sirs? What is all this noise, I say? The  king sent me to ask.    NIX. Farmer Knave does claim my colt, Prince.    PRINCE. How is this, Farmer Knave?    KNAVE. I claim the colt because the colt is mine, Prince.    PRINCE. Now how is this, Farmer Nix?    NIX. The colt is mine, Prince.    KNAVE. The colt is mine I say!    NIX. I say the colt is mine!    PRINCE. Hush, Farmer Nix! Hush, Farmer Knave! I'll tell the king what  both of you do claim. He will decide to whom the colt belongs.    [_The Prince goes._]    KNAVE. See how the colt lies between my oxen! Is not that proof that he  is mine?    NIX. But who can tell what a colt will do?    [_The_ PRINCE _comes._]    PRINCE. Farmers, the king has decided. He says the colt belongs where it  is now lying.    KNAVE. And he lies between my oxen.    PRINCE. That is proof enough, The colt belongs to you, Farmer Knave.    NIX. But, Prince--    PRINCE. Not another word! Go, now, with your wagons and horses and oxen!  The queen comes out to walk. Go, all of you!    [_The Prince enters the castle. The farmers go, Nix last. The_ QUEEN  _and her_ LADIES _come from the castle._]    QUEEN. Go bring Farmer Nix to me.    [_A Lady runs to Nix._]    LADY. The queen wants to see you, sir.    [_Nix goes to the Queen and bows._]    QUEEN. I heard all from the castle window. I know the colt is yours.    NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you!    QUEEN. Now you must show the king that colts cannot belong to oxen,  never have belonged to oxen, and never will belong to oxen.    NIX. I will go to him at once! I will tell him--    QUEEN. Not so fast! I said you must show the king. He would not let you  tell him. No one ever dares to tell things to a king.    NIX. How can I show him?    QUEEN. You must think out the way. I cannot help you more.    NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you.    QUEEN. The king comes out to walk soon.    NIX. I will return to show him.    [_Nix bows to the Queen and goes. The_ KING _and_ PRINCE _come from the  castle._]    QUEEN. 'Tis a pleasant day to walk, dear King.    KING. Oh, 'tis very, very pleasant.    [_Enter_ Nix _with a fishing-net. He throws out the net and draws it  in._]    QUEEN. Why, look you what that foolish man is doing!    KING. He throws out his net and draws it in! He acts just as if he were  fishing.    QUEEN. Let's ask what he is doing.    KING. Come here, you foolish fellow! Come here, I say!    (NIX _comes to the King, but goes on with his fishing._)    Now what are you doing, sir?    [Illustration]    NIX. I am fishing, fishing, fishing.    KING. How can you fish where is no water?    NIX. Fish can be found on land if colts belong to oxen.    KING. What is that, sir?    NIX. If colts belong to oxen, then fish should swim in dust.    KING. Well, well, that may be true! What do you think, dear Queen?    QUEEN. I think with you--it may be true.    NIX (_fishing_). If colts belong to oxen, then I will always fish in  dust.    KING. Well, well, I think you may be right, sir!    (_Pause. The King thinks deeply._)    Yes, I am now sure that you are right, sir. Go get your colt from Farmer  Knave. Go with him, Prince, and see to it. Now come, dear Queen, we'll  walk about together, for 'tis a very pleasant day, 'tis very, very  pleasant.

Before leaving Potchefstroom, the next morning, I paid a hasty visit to  the Fort and Cemetery, rendered so tragically historical in connection  with the Transvaal war. It was here that my lamented friend, the late  Chevalier Forssman, was shut up with his family for ninety days, and  lost during the siege, two of his children, a son and a daughter. I was  much struck with the picturesque appearance of Potchefstroom. It has a  population of about 2,000. Another long two days' journeying of about  sixty-four miles, through a prettier country than the wide wilderness  of the boundless and treeless plain, we had hitherto passed through in  the Western part of the Transvaal, brought us to Johannesburg.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    JOHANNESBURG.      We had some little trouble in finding our way into the town, as for the  last two hours the daylight failed, and we had to grope our way along at  a snail's pace in total darkness. This, in a country of such rough roads  and deep and dangerous gulleys and water-courses, was a most intricate  and difficult proceeding. Eventually, however, we reached our  destination about nine o'clock at night.    This \"auriferous\" town is indeed a marvellous place, lying on the crest  of a hill at an elevation of 5,000 feet above the level of the sea.  Along its sides are spread out every variety of habitation, from the  substantial brick and stone structures, which are being erected with  extraordinary rapidity, to the multitude of galvanised iron dwellings,  and the still not unfrequent tents of the first, and last comers. It is  indeed a wonderful and bewildering sight to view it from the opposite  hill across the intervening valley. Scarcely more than two years have  elapsed since this town of twenty-five thousand inhabitants commenced  its miraculous existence. The excitement and bustle of the motley crowd  of gold seekers and gold finders is tremendous, the whole of the  live-long day. The incessant subject of all conversation is gold, gold,  gold. It is in all their thoughts, excepting, perhaps, a too liberal  thought of drink. The people of Johannesburg think of gold; they talk of  gold; they dream of gold. I believe, if they could, they would eat and  drink gold. But, demoralising as this is to a vast number of those, who  are in the vortex of the daily doings of this remarkable place, the  startling fact is only too apparent to anyone who visits Johannesburg.  It is to be hoped that the day will come when the legitimate pursuit of  wealth will be followed in a less excitable, and a more calm and  decorous manner, than at present regretably prevails.    I spent a pleasant, as well as interesting, week at Johannesburg; and,  during my stay, visited several of the mines, among them Knight's, the  Jumpers, Robinson's, Langlaagte, &c. At Robinson's, I had an opportunity  of inspecting the wonderful battery just completed, and in full working  order, constructed on the most approved principles for gold crushing,  with sixty head of stamps. It is a marvellous specimen of mechanical  contrivance for crushing the ore. Many parts of the machinery work  automatically. I ascended the various floors, and had all the processes  minutely and clearly described to me in a most courteous manner, by the  superintendent of the battery. I afterwards went down into the mine,  first to the 70-feet, and then again to the 150-feet levels. In this  way, I passed two hours wandering underground with a candle in my hand,  and inspecting the gold-bearing lodes of one of the richest mines in the  Randt. This mine possesses magnificent lodes, and millions of tons of  gold-producing quartz. There is a prospect of most profitable results in  it for years to come. Altogether, from what I have seen of the various  gold mines of Johannesburg, I am satisfied of the permanence of its gold  fields. Of course they are not all of equal value; but many, even of  the poorer mines, when they come to be worked more scientifically, and  on proper business principles, will ultimately be found to pay fairly,  although they may never be destined to yield such brilliant results, as  some of those I have mentioned. The Market Square (of which an  illustration is given) is the largest in South Africa, covering an area  of 1,300 feet in length, and 300 feet in width. Some idea of the growth  of Johannesburg may be gathered from the fact, that at the latter part  of the year 1886 there was not a Post Office in existence, whilst the  revenue of that department for the first quarter of 1887 was L167, and  at the end of 1888 it had risen to L7,588.    [Illustration: JOHANNESBURG MARKET PLACE.]    This extraordinary and rapid growth has unfortunately produced the usual  results, when an immense population is suddenly planted on a limited  area, without any proper sanitary arrangements being provided for their  protection. From its elevated situation and naturally pure and dry  atmosphere, Johannesburg ought to be a very healthy town. That it  notoriously is not so, and that the amount of sickness and death-rate  from fever and other diseases is abnormal, must, undoubtedly, be  attributed to the great neglect and utter absence of an efficient system  of drainage. I fear this state of things will continue; and the  certainty of serious increase, as the population continues to grow  rapidly, is only too likely, until there is established some kind of  municipal body, acting under Governmental authority, to adopt a thorough  and complete system of sanitation. It is to be hoped that the Transvaal  Government, which is having its treasury so rapidly filled from the  pockets of the British population, which is pouring into Johannesburg,  as well as into so many other towns in the Transvaal, will awake in  time to the importance of taking measures for thoroughly remedying this  great and glaring evil, which is becoming such a scandal, as well as  creating such widely spread and justifiable alarm among the British  community in the Transvaal.[B]    [Illustration: Decorative]    [Footnote B: Since my return to England I am glad to hear that a  Sanitary Board is to be established at Johannesburg.]          [Illustration: Decorative]    PRETORIA.      From Johannesburg I proceeded to Pretoria, a distance of about  thirty-five miles, through a fine, and bold, and sometimes pretty  country. Some of the views on the way were extensive and picturesque.  Pretoria itself is an exceedingly pretty town, situated at the base of  the surrounding hills. There is a continuous, and most abundant supply  of water running through all the principal streets. Here, again, I was  forcibly reminded of the absence of any municipal body--although  Pretoria is the seat of Government--for dealing with the sanitary and  other wants of the town. The dust, every day (as at Johannesburg), was  intolerable, although, with the abundance of water flowing unceasingly  through the streets, it would be the easiest thing in the world to apply  it, as much as could possibly be wanted, to water them, and keep the  dust down. I remained for three weeks at Pretoria. While there I  attended some meetings of the Volksraad, accompanied by a Dutch friend  who kept me _au fait_ of the proceedings by translating to me the  speeches of the various members, on the subjects under discussion.    The debates are held in a very large, somewhat low-pitched apartment.  About fifty members were present. The President of the Volksraad sat at  a table on a platform, covered with green cloth. On one side of him, at  the same table, sat Paul Kruger, the President of the Transvaal  Republic. General Joubert--who defeated the English at Majuba Hill--sat  at a separate table on the left of the chairman.    I was also present, more than once, at the sittings of the High Court of  Justice. The proceedings are conducted both in English and Dutch.    By the courtesy of the Chief Justice, I was introduced by him at a  special interview, which lasted half-an-hour, to Paul Kruger. During our  conversation, which was carried on by my speaking in English, translated  into Dutch by the Chief Justice, I referred to the fact of my having  been introduced to him in England some years ago. I went on to speak of  my having come from England to South Africa to learn. That I had already  learned much, and that I was much pleased with all I had seen,  especially in the Transvaal, which seemed to me a country teeming with  riches and great natural resources. That I was a great friend to  railroads, and that I was never in a country which I thought required  railroads so much as the Transvaal. I expressed a hope, therefore, to  see the day when the country would be penetrated by them in every  direction--east, and south, and west. The President smiled at my  strongly expressed aspiration, but did not give me any other reply.    Like every other town in the Transvaal, Pretoria shows signs of  rapidly-growing prosperity. Public buildings and private dwelling-houses  are springing up in every direction. The Post Office, recently finished,  is capacious and commodious; and the new Government buildings for the  accommodation of the Volksraad and the Courts of Justice, already  commenced, but, as yet, only a few feet from the ground, and which cover  a very large space, promise to be very fine and imposing. While at  Pretoria I had ample opportunity for observing many of the prevalent  features of both political and social life, and especially of the  condition of the large native population of the town.    The Pretoria winter races took place during my stay there."]]]
