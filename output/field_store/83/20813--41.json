That basic principle was clearly accepted by this Court in _Re Royal  Commission on Licensing_ 1945 N.Z.L.R. 665. See especially the judgment  of Myers C.J. at pp. 678 to 680. As he indicated, the principle is  implicit in the judgment of the Privy Council in _Attorney-General for  Commonwealth of Australia v. Colonial Sugar Company_ 1914 A.C. 237. It  is also clear that in a broad sense the principles of natural justice  apply to Commissions of Inquiry, although what those principles require  varies with the subject-matter of the inquiry. The leading authority is  the decision of this Court in _Re Royal Commission on State Services_  1962 N.Z.L.R. 96.    In recent times Parliament has shown an increasing concern that natural  justice should be observed by Commissions. In 1958 s. 4A was inserted in  the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908, expressly giving any person  interested in the inquiry, if he satisfied the Commission that he had an  interest apart from any interest in common with the public, a right to  appear and be heard as if he had been cited as a party. Then in 1980,  just as the Erebus Commission was about to start, the section was  replaced and strengthened. The main changes made are that any person who  satisfies the Commission that any evidence given before it may adversely  affect his interests must be given an opportunity to be heard in respect  of the matter to which the evidence relates; and every person entitled  to be heard may appear in person or by his counsel or agent. In giving  this right to representation by counsel the Legislature has gone further  than observations made in this Court in the _State Services_ case at pp.  105, 111 and 117.    Some statements in the judgments in that case are very relevant to the  present case. They are also entirely consistent with the spirit of the  changes made by Parliament in 1980. Gresson P. at p. 105 and North J. at  p. 111 both gave an inquiry into a disaster as an example of the kind of  inquiry where the requirements of natural justice would be more  extensive than in inquiries into a general field. Cleary J. stressed at  p. 117 that, while Commissions have wide powers of regulating their own  procedure, there is the one limitation that persons interested (i.e.  apart from any interest in common with the public) must be afforded a  fair opportunity of presenting their representations, adducing evidence,  _and meeting prejudicial matter_.    In both the _Licensing_ and the _State Services_ cases the Commissions  were presided over by Supreme Court Judges. It is implicit in the  judgments that this status on the part of the Chairman does not  emancipate a Commission from judicial review on jurisdictional or  natural justice grounds. We hold that the position can be no different  when a High Court Judge is sole Commissioner. He will, however, have  the powers, privileges and immunities mentioned in s. 13 (1) of the  Commissions of Inquiry Act. For instance he will have immunity from  defamation actions.    A further important point, clear beyond argument, is that an order for  costs made by a Commission under s. 11 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act  is the exercise of a statutory power of decision within the meaning of  the Judicature Amendment Act 1972. Accordingly it is subject to judicial  review. The judgments in this Court in _Pilkington_ v. _Platts_ 1925  N.Z.L.R. 864 confirm that if an order for costs has been made by a  Commission acting without jurisdiction or failing to comply with  procedural requirements the Court will by writ or prohibition or other  appropriate remedy prevent its enforcement. We add that, notwithstanding  an argument by Mr Harrison to the contrary, we are satisfied that s. 11  was the only possible source of the Commissioner's power to award costs  and s. 13 was not and could not have been invoked.    The order for costs under challenge in the present case is the  Commissioner's order that Air New Zealand pay $150,000 by way of  contribution to the public cost of the inquiry. In our view there can be  no doubt that this order is and was intended to be, in the words of  Williams J. delivering the judgment of this Court in _Cock_ v.  _Attorney-General_ (1909) 28 N.Z.L.R. 405. 421, '... in fact, though not  in name, a punishment'. What is more important, although Mr Baragwanath  argued otherwise we have no doubt that reasonable readers of the report  would understand that this order is linked with and consequential upon  the adverse conclusions stated by the Commissioner in the section of the  report headed by him 'The Stance adopted by the Airline before the  Commission of Inquiry'. It is true that the reasons for the costs order  open with a proposition about unnecessarily extending the hearing. But  the passage develops and the later reasons go further. The words chosen  convey that the punishment was not simply for prolonging the hearing. In  particular the statements about cards in the pack are a reversion to the  theme of the 'Stance' section, with its exceedingly strong allegations  in paragraph 377 of 'a pre-determined plan of deception' and 'an  orchestrated litany of lies'.    Applying the well-settled principles already mentioned, we think that if  in making those statements the Commissioner exceeded his terms of  reference or acted in violation of natural justice, the costs order is  not realistically severable from that part of the report and should be  quashed. For the purposes of the present case that is sufficient to  dispose of the argument based on _Reynolds_ v. _Attorney-General_ (1909)  29 N.Z.L.R. 24 that after a Commission has reported it is functus  officio and beyond the reach of certiorari or prohibition.    Naturally the stance of the airline at the inquiry directed by the terms  of reference was not included expressly in those terms. The argument  presented in effect for the Commissioner on the question of jurisdiction  is that comments, however severe, on the veracity and motives of  witnesses were incidental to the carrying out of the express terms. We  accept unhesitatingly that what is reasonably incidental is authorised  (as was recognised in _Cock's_ case at p. 425) and also that to some  degree any Commission of Inquiry has the right to express its opinion of  the witnesses, much as a Court or statutory tribunal has that right.    But we think that it is a matter of degree. For present purposes it is  not necessary to decide whether the law of New Zealand is still, as held  in _Cock's_ case, that a Commission of Inquiry cannot lawfully be  constituted to inquire into allegations of crime. That issue may be  raised more directly by the litigation regarding the Thomas Commission.  The issue now to be decided is whether the Commissioner had powers,  implied as being reasonably incidental to his legitimate functions of  inquiry into the causes and circumstances of the crash, to make  assertions amounting to charges of conspiracy to perjure at the inquiry  itself.    In considering that issue the importance of not unreasonably shackling a  Commission of Inquiry has to be weighed. It is also material, however,  that such a charge is calculated to attract the widest publicity, both  national and international. It is scarcely distinguishable in the public  mind from condemnation by a Court of law. Yet it is completely without  the safeguards of rights to trial by jury and appeal. In other words, by  mere implication any Commission of Inquiry, whatever its membership,  would have authority publicly to condemn a group of citizens of a major  crime without the safeguards that invariably go with express powers of  condemnation.    We are not prepared to hold that the Commissioner's implied powers went  so far. We hold that he exceeded his jurisdiction in paragraph 377.    If, contrary to the view just expressed, the Commissioner did have  jurisdiction to consider allegations of organised perjury, natural  justice would certainly have required that the allegations be stated  plainly and put plainly to those accused. That was not done. If it had  been done, what we have said earlier is enough to show that they could  well have made effective answers.    So we conclude that in making the findings or allegations stated in  paragraph 377 of the report the Commission acted in excess of  jurisdiction and contrary to natural justice. As previously mentioned,  the conspiracy postulated in paragraph 377 is evidently intended to  include as participants the chief executive of the airline, the  executive pilots and members of the navigation section. If the order for  $150,000 costs is quashed on the ground that the statements about a  pre-determined plan of deception and an orchestrated litany of lies were  made without jurisdiction and contrary to natural justice, we think that  substantial justice will be done to the company and those individuals.  In our opinion that costs order must be quashed on those grounds as well  as on the ground that it was invalid as to amount.    Further, during the proceedings in this Court there occurred  developments which in themselves threw a different light on matters  dealt with in the paragraphs under attack affecting Captain Gemmell  particularly. These should be publicly recorded.    It was acknowledged by all parties, including the Commissioner, that the  reference to Captain Gemmell in paragraph 352, concerning a notebook  belonging to Captain Collins, was a mistake. The Commissioner evidently  had in mind some evidence given by Captain Crosbie, the welfare officer  of the Air Line Pilots Association. This disposes of any inference  against Captain Gemmell that might be taken from that paragraph.    Much the same applies to the other paragraphs affecting him which are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#6)"],[1," The rifle clattered on to the  rocks, but as we drew round him he pulled his revolver with his one good  hand, and started to pot us. He looked a gamecock as he stood there in the  sunlight, his face all bathed in blood, and his shattered hand hanging  numbed beside him. So we gave him a couple in the legs to steady him, and  down by his dead horse he went; but even then he was as eager for fight as  a grass widow is for compliments, and it was not until Jan Viljoens jammed  the butt of his rifle on the crown of his head that he stretched himself  out and took no further part in that circus. We carried him into our lines,  and handed him over to our medical man, though even as we gathered him up  our scouts came galloping in to tell us that a big body of British troops  were advancing to cut us off from our main body. But we knew that if we  left him until your ambulance people found him, it was a million to one  that he would bleed to death amongst the rocks, and he was too good a  fighter and too brave a fellow to be left to a fate like that. Had he shown  the white feather we might have left him to the asvogels.\"    \"And so,\" said I, \"that is how little Dowling, son of Australia, came, as  he said, 'to stop a few' for the sake of his breeding. If I live, the men  out in the sunny Southland shall hear how he did it, and his name shall be  known round the gold-hunters' camp fires, and be mentioned with pride where  the cattle drovers foregather to talk of the African war and the men who  fought and fell there.\"                                    AUSTRALIA AT THE WAR.                                                                   ENSLIN CAMP.      Lately I have been over a very considerable tract of country in the saddle.  I might remain at one spot and glean the information from various sources,  but do not care to do my business in that manner, simply because one is  then at the mercy of one's informants. I find it quite hard enough to get  at the truth even when it is personally sought for. It is really astounding  how lies increase and multiply as they spread from camp to camp. At one  spot a fellow ventilates an opinion that a big battle will be fought next  day at a certain spot; some other person catches a portion of the  conversation, and promptly tells his neighbour that a big battle has taken  place at the spot mentioned. A little later a passing train pulls up at  that camp, and a party possessing a picturesque and vivid imagination at  once informs the guard that a fearful fight has occurred, in which a  General, a Colonel, twelve subs., and six hundred men have been killed on  our side, with fourteen hundred wounded and nine hundred prisoners. The  Boer losses are generally estimated at something like five times that  number.    The guard tells the tale later on to some traveller, who embellishes it,  and passes it along as a fact. He goes into details, tells harrowing  stories concerning hair-raising escapes from shot and shell. He splashes  the surrounding rocks with gouts of blood, and then shudders dismally at  the sight his fancy has conjured up. When the thrilled listener has  refreshed the tale-teller from his whisky flask, the romancist takes up the  thread of his narrative once more, and tells how the Lancers thundered over  the shivering veldts in pursuit of flying hordes of foemen, and for awhile,  like some graveyard ghoul, he revels in the moans of the dying and the  blood of the slain. Another pull at the flask sets him going again like  clockwork, and he makes a vivid picture out of the thunder of the guns as  our gallant (they are always gallant) fellows bombarded the enemy from the  heights.    Then he switches off from the artillery, and tells a blood-curdling tale of  Boer treachery and cowardice. He tells how the enemy held out the white  flag to coax our men to stop firing. Then, in awe-inspiring tones, he sobs  forth a tale of dark and dismal war, how our soldiers respected the white  flag and rested on their arms, only to be mowed down by a withering rifle  fire from the canaille who represent the enemy in the field. Having got so  far, he does not feel justified in stopping until he has thrown in some  flowery language concerning a Boer cannonade upon British ambulance  waggons, full of wounded; from that he drifts by easy and natural stages to  Dum-Dum bullets, and the robbing of the wounded, and insults to the slain.  And that is very often the person who is quoted in newspaper interviews--as  a gentleman who was an eye-witness, and etc., etc., etc.    And yet, for some reason which I have been unable to gauge, the military  authorities talk of sending all correspondents away from the front. It  seems to me that it would be far better to give _bona fide_ newspaper  men every reasonable opportunity of discovering the truth instead of  hampering them in any way. I fail to see why Great Britain and her Colonies  should be kept in the dark concerning the progress of the war, for all the  foreign Powers will be well supplied with information from the Boer lines;  and, if we are blocked, some at least of the British newspapers will most  assuredly go to foreign sources for news, if they are not allowed to obtain  it for themselves. Others will content themselves with news gathered  haphazard, and the last state of the Army, as far as the public mind is  concerned, will be far worse than the first.    Colonel Hoad, who commands the Australians at Enslin, has offered the seven  hundred and sixteen men, who up to date have acted as infantry, to the  authorities as mounted infantry, and the offer has been accepted, much to  the delight of the men, all of whom are very eager to get into the saddle,  as they imagine that when their mounts arrive they will get a chance to go  into action. They have been practising horsemanship during the day, and did  fairly well, as many of them are expert riders, many more are fair; but a  few of them are more at home on a sand-heap than in a saddle. There are not  many of the latter kind, however. They will soon knock into shape, for  Colonel Hoad hates the sight of a slovenly horseman as badly as a duck  hates a dust storm. He is an untiring rider himself, and will work the  beggars who cannot ride until they can.    After the arrival in Capetown of the two celebrated soldiers, Lords Roberts  and Kitchener, I made it my business to converse with as many Boers as  possible in regard to the two Generals, and was astonished to find how much  they knew concerning them. How, and from whom, they get information passes  my comprehension, but the fact remains that they knew all over the country  as soon, if not sooner, than we did that our great leaders had arrived.  They do not seem to fear them, though they invariably speak of them as  wonderful soldiers. \"God and Oom Paul Kruger will look after us,\" is their  creed. Their faith in President Kruger is simply boundless. Not only do  they fancy that he is a man of dauntless courage, great sagacity, and  indomitable will, but they really seem to think that he has God's special  blessing concerning this war.    He is to the Boers what Mahomet was to the wild tribesmen of Arabia, and it  is as impossible to shake their faith in him as it would be to shake their  faith in the story of Mount Calvary. It is all very well for a certain  class of writers to attempt to cast unbounded ridicule upon these men and  their leader, but it is not by ridicule that they can be conquered. It is  not by contemptuous utterances or by untrue reports that they can be  overcome. It is not by belittling them that we can raise ourselves in the  eyes of the men of to-day or ennoble ourselves upon the pages of history.  It would be conduct more in accordance with the traditions of a great  nation if we gave them credit for the virtues they possess and the courage  they display.    It is hard to drag any sort of information from a Boer, whether bond or  free, but from what I can pick up they are perfectly satisfied with what  they have done up to date. They think that President Kruger has astonished  the world, and they wag their heads, and give one to understand that the  same old gentleman has a good many more surprises in store for us. It is  impossible to get a direct statement of any kind from them, but by patching  fragments together I incline to the opinion that they really count on Cape  Colony rising when Kruger wants a rising. Personally, from my own limited  observations, I would not give a fig of tobacco for the alleged loyalty of  the Cape Colony. If I am correct, this \"surprise\" will give the enemy an  additional force of 45,000 men, most of whom will be found able to ride  well and shoot straight.    It is nonsense to say that they will only form a mob destitute of  discipline and unprovided with officers. They will not be a mob, they will  be guerilla soldiers of the same type that the North and South in America  provided, and they will take a lot of whipping at their own peculiar  tactics. As for officers--well, up to date, they have not gone short of  them. It is true they do not bear the hallmark of any modern university,  but they know how to lead men into battle, all the same. They wear no  uniforms, neither do they adorn themselves with any of the stylish  trappings of war, but they are brainy, resourceful men, highly useful if  not ornamental. Like Oliver Cromwell's hard-faced \"Roundheads,\" they are  the children of a great emergency, not much to look at, but full of a \"get  there\" quality, which many school-bred soldiers lack entirely.    I rode down to Belmont a couple of days ago, and had a look at the  Canadians and Queenslanders, who are quartered there. They are all in  excellent health and spirits, and seem to be just about hungry for a fight.  The Munsters, who are quartered there, are simply spoiling for a brush with  the enemy, and seem to be as full of ginger as any men I have ever seen.    And "]]]
