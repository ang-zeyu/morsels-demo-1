SOCRATES: Then either we were wrong in our former assertion; or, if we  were right then, we are wrong now.    EUTHYPHRO: One of the two must be true.    SOCRATES: Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety? That is an  enquiry which I shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me lies;  and I entreat you not to scorn me, but to apply your mind to the utmost,  and tell me the truth. For, if any man knows, you are he; and therefore  I must detain you, like Proteus, until you tell. If you had not  certainly known the nature of piety and impiety, I am confident that  you would never, on behalf of a serf, have charged your aged father with  murder. You would not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight  of the gods, and you would have had too much respect for the opinions  of men. I am sure, therefore, that you know the nature of piety and  impiety. Speak out then, my dear Euthyphro, and do not hide your  knowledge.    EUTHYPHRO: Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must go now.    SOCRATES: Alas! my companion, and will you leave me in despair? I was  hoping that you would instruct me in the nature of piety and impiety;  and then I might have cleared myself of Meletus and his indictment. I  would have told him that I had been enlightened by Euthyphro, and had  given up rash innovations and speculations, in which I indulged only  through ignorance, and that now I am about to lead a better life."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#6)"],[1,"you'd get up  to have a look at it yourself. Killing Jack Smith indeed! Where  are you at all, Bartley, till I bring you out of this? My nice  quiet little man! My decent comrade! He that is as kind and as  harmless as an innocent beast of the field! He'll be doing no  harm at all if he'll shed the blood of some of you after this  day's work! That much would be no harm at all. (_Calls out_)  Bartley! Bartley Fallen! Where are you? (_Going out_) Did anyone  see Bartley Fallon?    (_All turn to look after her._)    JAMES RYAN. It is hard for her to believe any such a thing, God  help her!    (_Enter BARTLEY FALLON from right, carrying hayfork._)    BARTLEY. It is what I often said to myself, if there is ever any  misfortune coming to this world it is on myself it is sure to  come!    (_All turn round and face him._)    BARTLEY. To be going about with this fork and to find no one to  take it, and no place to leave it down, and I wanting to be gone  out of this--Is that you, Shawn Early?    (_Holds out fork._) It's well I met you. You have no call to be  leaving the fair for a while the way I have, and how can I go  till I'm rid of this fork? Will you take it and keep it until  such time as Jack Smith--    SHAWN EARLY (_backing_). I will not take it, Bartley Fallon, I'm  very thankful to you!    BARTLEY (_turning to apple stall_). Look at it now, Mrs. Tarpey, it  was here I got it; let me thrust it in under the stall. It will  lie there safe enough, and no one will take notice of it until  such time as Jack Smith--    MRS. TARPEY. Take your fork out of that! Is it to put trouble on  me and to destroy me you want? putting it there for the police to  be rooting it out maybe.    (_Thrusts him back._)    BARTLEY. That is a very unneighborly thing for you to do, Mrs.  Tarpey. Hadn't I enough care on me with that fork before this,  running up and down with it like the swinging of a clock, and  afeard to lay it down in any place! I wish I'd never touched it  or meddled with it at all!    JAMES RYAN. It is a pity, indeed, you ever did.    BARTLEY. Will you yourself take it, James Ryan? You were always a  neighborly man.    JAMES RYAN (_backing_). There is many a thing I would do for you,  Bartley Fallon, but I won't do that!    SHAWN EARLY. I tell you there is no man will give you any help or  any encouragement for this day's work. If it was something  agrarian now--    BARTLEY. If no one at all will take it, maybe it's best to give  it up to the police.    TIM CASEY. There'd be a welcome for it with them surely!    (_Laughter._)    MRS. TULLY. And it is to the police Kitty Keary herself will be  brought.    MRS. TARPEY (_rocking to and fro_). I wonder now who will take the  expense of the wake for poor Jack Smith?    BARTLEY. The wake for Jack Smith!    TIM CASEY. Why wouldn't he get a wake as well as another? Would  you begrudge him that much?    BARTLEY. Red Jack Smith dead! Who was telling you?    SHAWN EARLY. The whole town knows of it by this.    BARTLEY. Do they say what way did he die?    JAMES RYAN. You don't know that yourself, I suppose, Bartley  Fallon? You don't know he was followed and that he was laid dead  with the stab of a hayfork?    BARTLEY. The stab of a hayfork!    SHAWN EARLY. You don't know, I suppose, that the body was found  in the Five-Acre Meadow?    BARTLEY. The Five-Acre Meadow!    TIM CASEY. It is likely you don't know that the police are after  the man that did it?    BARTLEY. The man that did it!    MRS. TULLY. You don't know, maybe, that he was made away with for  the sake of Kitty Keary, his wife?    BARTLEY. Kitty Keary, his wife! (_Sits down bewildered._)    MRS. TULLY. And what have you to say now, Bartley Fallon?    BARTLEY (_crossing himself_). I to bring that fork here, and to  find that news before me! It is much if I can ever stir from this  place at all, or reach as far as the road!    TIM CASEY. Look, boys, at the new magistrate, and Jo Muldoon  along with him! It's best for us to quit this.    SHAWN EARLY. That is so. It is best not to be mixed in this  business at all.    JAMES RYAN. Bad as he is, I wouldn't like to be an informer  against any man.    (_All hurry away except_ MRS. TARPEY, _who remains behind her stall.  Enter_ MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN.)    MAGISTRATE. I knew the district was in a bad state, but I did not  expect to be confronted with a murder at the first fair I came  to.    POLICEMAN. I am sure you did not, indeed.    MAGISTRATE. It was well I had not gone home. I caught a few words  here and there that roused my suspicions.    POLICEMAN. So they would, too.    MAGISTRATE. You heard the same story from everyone you asked?    POLICEMAN. The same story--or if it was not altogether the same,  anyway it was no less than the first story.    MAGISTRATE. What is that man doing? He is sitting alone with a  hayfork. He has a guilty look. The murder was done with a  hayfork!    POLICEMAN (_in a whisper_). That's the very man they say did the  act, Bartley Fallon himself!    MAGISTRATE. He must have found escape difficult--he is trying to  brazen it out. A convict in the Andaman Islands tried the same  game, but he could not escape my system! Stand aside--Don't go  far--Have the handcuffs ready. (_He walks up to BARTLEY, folds his  arms, and stands before him._) Here, my man, do you know anything  of John Smith?    BARTLEY. Of John Smith! Who is he, now?    POLICEMAN. Jack Smith, sir--Red Jack Smith!    MAGISTRATE (_coming a step nearer and tapping him on the  shoulder_). Where is Jack Smith?    BARTLEY (_with a deep sigh, and shaking his head slowly_). Where is  he, indeed?    MAGISTRATE. What have you to tell?    BARTLEY. It is where he was this morning, standing in this spot,  singing his share of songs--no, but lighting his pipe--scraping a  match on the sole of his shoe--    MAGISTRATE. I ask you, for the third time, where is he?    BARTLEY. I wouldn't like to say that. It is a great mystery, and  it is hard to say of any man, did he earn hatred or love.    MAGISTRATE. Tell me all you know.    BARTLEY. All that I know--Well, there are the three estates;  there is Limbo, and there is Purgatory, and there is--    MAGISTRATE. Nonsense! This is trifling! Get to the point.    BARTLEY. Maybe you don't hold with the clergy so? That is the  teaching of the clergy. Maybe you hold with the old people. It is  what they do be saying, that the shadow goes wandering, and the  soul is tired, and the body is taking a rest--The shadow! (_Starts  up._) I was nearly sure I saw Jack Smith not ten minutes ago at  the corner of the forge, and I lost him again--Was it his ghost I  saw, do you think?    MAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). Conscience-struck! He will confess all  now!    BARTLEY. His ghost to come before me! It is likely it was on  account of the fork! I to have it and he to have no way to defend  himself the time he met with his death!    MAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). I must note down his words. (_Takes out  notebook. To_ BARTLEY) I warn you that your words are being noted.    BARTLEY. If I had ha' run faster in the beginning, this terror  would not be on me at the latter end! Maybe he will cast it up  against me at the day of judgment--I wouldn't wonder at all at  that.    MAGISTRATE (_writing_). At the day of judgment--    BARTLEY. It was soon for his ghost to appear to me--is it coming  after me always by day it will be, and stripping the clothes off  in the nighttime?--I wouldn't wonder at all at that, being as I  am an unfortunate man!    MAGISTRATE (_sternly_). Tell me this truly. What was the motive of  this crime?    BARTLEY. The motive, is it?    MAGISTRATE. Yes, the motive; the cause.    BARTLEY. I'd sooner not say that.    MAGISTRATE. You'd better tell me truly. Was it money?    BARTLEY. Not at all! What did poor Jack Smith ever have in his  pockets unless it might be his hands that would be in them?    MAGISTRATE. Any dispute about land?    BARTLEY (_indignantly_). Not at all! He never was a grabber or  grabbed from anyone!    MAGISTRATE. You will find it better for you if you tell me at  once.    BARTLEY. I tell you I wouldn't for the whole world wish to say  what it was--it is a thing I would not like to be talking about.    MAGISTRATE. There is no use in hiding it. It will be discovered  in the end.    BARTLEY. Well, I suppose it will, seeing that mostly everybody  knows it before. Whisper here now. I will tell no lie; where  would be the use? (_Puts his hand to his mouth and MAGISTRATE  stoops._) Don't be putting the blame on the parish, for such a  thing was never done in the parish before--it was done for the  sake of Kitty Keary, Jack Smith's wife.    MAGISTRATE (_to_ POLICEMAN). Put on the handcuffs. We have been  saved some trouble. I knew he would confess if taken in the right  way.    (POLICEMAN _puts on handcuffs._)    BARTLEY. Handcuffs now! Glory be! I always said, if there was  ever any misfortune coming to this place it was on myself it  would fall. I to be in handcuffs! There's no wonder at all in  that.    (_Enter MRS. FALLON, followed by the rest. She is looking back at  them as she speaks._)    MRS. FALLON. Telling lies the whole of the people of this town  are; telling lies, telling lies as fast as a dog will trot!  Speaking against my poor respectable man! Saying he made an end  of Jack Smith! My decent comrade! There is no better man and no  kinder man in the whole of the five parishes! It's little  annoyance he ever gave to anyone! (_Turns and sees him._) What in  the earthly world do I see before me? Bartley Fallon in charge of  the police! Handcuffs on him! O Bartley, Bartley, what did you do  at all at all?    BAHTLEY. O Mary, there has a great misfortune come upon me! It is  what I always said, that if there is ever any misfortune--    MRS. FALLON. What did he do at all, or is it bewitched I am?    MAGISTRATE. This man has been arrested on a charge of murder.    MRS. FALLON. Whose charge is that? Don't believe them! They are  all"]]]
