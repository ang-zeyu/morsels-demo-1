The most destructive of the carnivora are lions, leopards,       chitas, hunting dogs, caracals and servals.         Baboons, porcupines, &c., being destructive in various ways,       are considered to be vermin.         Vermin have perceptibly decreased during the last few years,       in spite of the fact that the game has increased at the rate       of fully 10 per cent, per annum.         About 1,500 head of vermin, on an average, are destroyed       annually. The figures for 1910 included 21 lions, 24       leopards, 31 wild dogs, &c., the balance being made up of       chetahs, caracals, servals, civets, genets, wild cats,       hyenas, jackals, otters, baboons, crocodiles, pythons and       birds of prey.         There were 133 prosecutions for infringement of the       regulations, all against natives.    Dr. Charles W. Townsend, Boston, Mass., an eminent ornithologist,  says:         I have just read with much interest your Address on _Animal       Sanctuaries in Labrador_, and wish to tell you how fully I       agree with you, not only as to the importance of stopping       the destruction in Labrador before it is too late, but also       in the value of animal sanctuaries in general and of       Labrador in particular. I sincerely hope you will succeed in       your good work.         In the _Birds of Labrador_, 1907, Boston Society of Natural       History, by Mr. Glover, Mr. Allen and myself, we called       especial attention to the great destruction of life that has       gone on and is still going on there, and we suggested the       protection of the eiders for their down, as is done in       Norway, instead of their extermination, the present course.    Commander W. Wakeham, of the Department of Marine, says:         No one can question the desirability of having certain areas       set apart, where wild animals may find asylum, and rest....         A few years ago, from some unusual cause, the woodland       caribou, in great numbers, visited that part of Labrador,       east of Forteau, and along down as far as St. Charles. A       large number were there killed by the white settlers--but       this was a solitary, and exceptional year. The Indians who       hunt in the interior of Labrador undoubtedly do kill a large       number of these caribou; but, when we consider the great       extent of country over which these deer migrate, compared       with the comparatively small number of Indians--and there is       a steadily decreasing number--I can hardly believe that       there is much fear of their ever exterminating these deer.       Then, could we possibly prevent these Indians from hunting       the deer wherever they meet them? I hardly think we could.       The barren-ground caribou are not hunted to any extent by       whites. During the month of August, the Eskimo of the Ungava       peninsula, as well as those in Baffin island, resort to       certain fords, or narrows where these caribou usually pass       at the beginning of the fall migration. They kill       considerable numbers--rather for the skins as clothing, than       for food. But the Eskimo are few in number, and I cannot       conceive that there is any fear of these caribou ever being       greatly reduced in number by these native hunters. Any one       who has ever met a herd of barren-ground caribou, and seen       the countless thousands of them, could hardly conceive of       their ever being exterminated. Nor would they be if we had       to deal only with the native hunters. But, with our       experience of what happened to the buffalo when the white       man took up the slaughter, we must take precaution in time.         Up to the present, very few white men have penetrated any       distance into the interior of the Labrador peninsula, and I       do not see that they are very likely to, in the near future.       But we never can tell. A few years ago we would have said       the same of the Yukon region, so that it would be a wise       precaution to have set apart a considerable section of the       Labrador, in the interior, as a sanctuary.... It would       perhaps be better to have two regions set apart, one near       the Saguenay country and another nearer the Atlantic coast.       We have, however, to consider the fact that sanctuaries       will be of no value unless they are well guarded.         In the case of the birds the conditions are bad; the       destruction on the Labrador is horrible to contemplate. The       outer islands were scoured by crews from foreign vessels,       and whole loads of eggs carried off. There has not been much       of this done in recent years. There can he no doubt that, if       certain of the larger and less inhabited islands were set       apart, and carefully protected, the birds would return to       them. I believe that owing to the constant way in which the       birds--eider ducks, certain of the divers, gulls, &c., were       disturbed, on their natural and original nesting places,       they have changed their habits; and, instead of nesting on       the islands and by the sea, they have moved to the shores of       the interior lakes. You see flocks of young birds in the       fall; they have come from the interior, as they were not       hatched out on the islands as they used to be.         The destruction of geese and curlew does not take place on       the Labrador. These birds are not disturbed on their nesting       grounds; but, to the south and west when they are passing to       their winter haunts. Geese are found feeding on the       hill-sides, on the most distant and northern islands--as far       north as any of our explorers have gone. The first birds       Sverdrup met as he was coming south, in the early spring,       were wild geese. These birds are not disturbed on their       breeding grounds. The Eskimo do not meddle with them. In the       same way caribou are found feeding about the shores of       Hudson bay and strait. Like the geese, they feed on berries       about the hill sides. I have shot them at the mouth of       Churchill river, and near cape Digges in August, when they       were very fat--so fat that it is said that, on falling on       hard ground, they would burst open; though this did not       actually happen in my case. I certainly think that it would       be a grand thing to have certain groups of islands--or even       certain sections of coast--set apart as bird sanctuaries.         Your paper deals entirely with conditions in Labrador. There       is, however, another part of the Gulf coast, where the need       of protection is much greater than on the Labrador. That is       the interior of the Gaspe peninsula. A certain region in the       interior has been set aside as a park, but it is quite       unprotected. Here, we have moose, woodland caribou and the       red deer, besides nearly all the fur-bearing animals that we       find on the Labrador. There is no game protection whatever.       Moose and caribou are killed mostly out of season--when they       are yarded, or when it is easy to run them down. In many       cases the meat is left in the woods, the hide only being       wanted. Lumbermen are penetrating up the rivers, further       into the interior--every lumber camp is a centre from which       the game laws are persistently violated.... the game, both       fur and feather, (particularly the ruffled grouse) is       rapidly disappearing before their pitiless onslaughts.       Lumber camps are opened much earlier in the season than they       used to be; so that the interior lakes and head waters of       the rivers are being cleaned out of fish taken while in the       act of spawning. All this may seem very strong language; but       it is really not exaggerated. It may help to show the need       of more and better conservation....    Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace, the founder and exponent of the science of  zoo-geography, writes:         ... your address on \"Animal Sanctuaries\" in Labrador, which       I have read with the greatest interest and astonishment.       Such reckless destruction I should hardly have thought       possible.         There is a considerable public opinion now against the use       of feathers as _ornaments_[A] because it inevitably leads to       the extermination of some of the most beautiful of living       things; but I think the attempts to stop it by legal       enactments begin at the wrong end. They seek to punish the       actual collectors or importers of the plumes, who are really       the least guilty and the most difficult to get at. It is the       actual _wearers_ of such ornaments who should be subject to       fines or even imprisonment, because, without the _demand_       they make there would be no supply. They also are,       presumably, the most educated and should know better. If it       were known that any lady with a feather in her hat (or       elsewhere) would be taken before a magistrate and _fined_,       and, on a second offence, _imprisoned_, and if this were the       case in the chief civilized countries of Europe and America,       the whole trade would at once cease and the poor birds be       left in peace.         You have, however, treated the subject very carefully and       thoroughly, and I hope your views will be soon carried       out....         I am glad to hear that Mr. Roosevelt is a reader of the       \"World of Life.\" My own interest is more especially in the       preservation of adequate areas of the glorious tropical and       equatorial forests, with their teeming and marvellous forms       of life.    Numerous other letters from all parts of the world expressing  appreciation of the _Address_ have been received, the correspondents  expressing strong approval of the effort to establish Animal  Sanctuaries in Labrador. The names of some of the correspondents are  given herewith:    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"would not displease my master for all the kingdoms of earth,  although your beauty I consider greater than that of the sun.\"    Thus they arrived at the King's capital, and the wedding took place  amidst great rejoicings; but Princess Goldenhair, who loved Avenant  from the depths of her heart, was not happy unless she could see him,  and was for ever singing his praises. \"I should not have come, had it  not been for Avenant,\" she told the King, \"you ought to be very much  obliged to him.\" Then the envious courtiers counselled the King, and  Avenant was cast once more into the tower, chained hand and foot. When  Princess Goldenhair heard of this imprisonment, she fell on her knees  before the King, and begged for Avenant's release; but he would not  heed her, so that she became saddened and would speak no more.    Then the King thought: \"Maybe I am not handsome enough to please her!\"  so he determined to wash his face in the water of beauty.    Now it had happened that a chamber-maid had broken the flask  containing this wonderful water, so that it was all spilled; then,  without saying anything to anyone, she had replaced it by a similar  flask taken from the King's apartment, but the liquid in this flask  was really that which was used when the princes or great lords were  condemned to death, for, instead of being beheaded, their faces were  washed with this water and they fell asleep and did not wake again.  And so the King using this water one evening, thinking it to be the  beauty water, and hoping and expecting to be made more handsome, went  to sleep and awoke no more. Upon hearing what had occurred, Cabriole  at once went and told Avenant, who asked him to go to the Princess  Goldenhair and beseech her to remember the poor prisoner. When the  Princess received this message, she went straight to the tower, and,  with her own hands, struck off the chains that bound Avenant, and  placing a crown of gold upon his head, and a royal mantle upon his  shoulders, said: \"Come, dear Avenant, I will make you King, and take  you for my husband.\" Then there was a grand wedding, and Princess  Goldenhair and Avenant, with Cabriole, lived long, all of them happy  and contented.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD      Many years ago there lived a dear little girl, who was beloved by  everyone who knew her; but her grandmother was so very fond of her  that she never felt that she could think and do enough for her.    On her grand-daughter's birthday she presented her with a red silk  hood; and as it suited her very well, she would never wear anything  else; and so she was called Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother  said to her, \"Come, Red Riding Hood, here is a nice piece of meat,  and a bottle of wine: take these to your grandmother; she is weak and  ailing, and they will do her good. Be there before she gets up; go  quietly and carefully; and do not run, or you may fall and break the  bottle, and then your grandmother will have nothing. When you go into  her room, do not forget to say 'Good-morning'; and do not pry into all  the corners.\" \"I will do just as you say,\" answered Red Riding Hood,  bidding good-bye to her mother.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]    The grandmother lived far away in the wood, a long walk from the  village, and as Little Red Riding Hood came among the trees she met a  wolf; but she did not know what a wicked animal it was, and so she  was not at all frightened. \"Good-morning, Little Red Riding Hood,\" he  said.    \"Thank you, Mr. Wolf,\" she said.    \"Where are you going so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\"    \"To my grandmother's,\" she answered.    \"And what are you carrying under your apron?\"    \"Some wine and meat,\" she replied. \"We baked the meat yesterday, so  that grandmother, who is very weak, might have a nice strengthening  meal.\"    \"And where does your grandmother live?\" asked the Wolf.    \"Oh, quite twenty minutes' walk further in the forest. The cottage  stands under three great oak trees; and close by are some nut bushes,  by which you will at once know it.\"    The wolf was thinking to himself, \"She is a nice tender thing, and  will taste better than the old woman; I must act cleverly, that I may  make a meal of both.\"    [Illustration: \"WHERE ARE YOU GOING SO EARLY, LITTLE RED RIDING  HOOD.\"]    Presently he came up again to Little Red Riding Hood and said. \"Just  look at the beautiful flowers which grow near you; why do you not look  about you? I believe you don't hear how sweetly the birds are singing.  You walk as if you were going to school; see how cheerful everything  is around you in the forest.\"    And Little Red Riding Hood opened her eyes; and when she saw how the  sunbeams glanced and danced through the trees, and what bright flowers  were blooming in her path, she thought, \"If I take my grandmother a  fresh nosegay she will be much pleased; and it is so very early that  I can, even then, get there in good time:\" and running into the forest  she looked about for flowers. But when she had once begun she did  not know how to leave off, and kept going deeper and deeper among the  trees looking for some still more beautiful flower. The Wolf, however,  ran straight to the house of the old grandmother, and knocked at the  door.    \"Who's that?\" asked the old lady.    \"Only little Red Riding Hood, bringing you some meat and wine; please  open the door,\" answered the Wolf.    \"Lift up the latch,\" cried the grandmother; \"I am much too ill to get  up myself.\"    So the Wolf lifted the latch, and the door flew open; and without a  word he jumped on to the bed and gobbled up the poor old lady. Then he  put on her clothes, and tied her night-cap over his head; got into the  bed, and drew the blankets over him.    All this time Red Riding Hood was gathering flowers; and when she had  picked as many as she could carry, she thought of her grandmother, and  hurried to the cottage. She wondered very much to find the door  open; and when she got into the room, she began to feel very ill, and  exclaimed, \"How sad I feel! I wish I had not come to-day.\" Then she  said, \"Good morning,\" but received no reply; so she went up to the  bed, and drew back the curtains, and there lay her grandmother as  she imagined, with the cap drawn half over her eyes and looking very  fierce.    \"Oh, grandmother, what great ears you have!\"    \"All the better to hear you with,\" was the reply.    \"And what great eyes you have!\"    \"All the better to see you with.\"    \"And what great hands you have!\"    \"All the better to touch you with.\"    \"But, grandmother, what very great teeth you have!\"    \"All the better to eat you with;\" and hardly were the words spoken  when the Wolf made a jump out of bed and swallowed down poor Little  Red Riding Hood also.    As soon as he had thus satisfied his hunger, he laid himself down  again on the bed, and went to sleep and snored very loudly. A huntsman  passing by overheard him, and said, \"How loudly that old woman snores!  I must see if anything is the matter.\"    So he went into the cottage; and when he came to the bed, he saw the  Wolf sleeping in it.    \"What! are you here, you old rascal? I have been looking for you,\"  exclaimed he; and taking up his gun, he shot the old Wolf through the  head.    But it is also said that the story ends in a different manner; for  that one day, when Red Riding Hood was taking some presents to her  grandmother, a Wolf met her, and wanted to mislead her; but she went  straight on, and told her grandmother that she had met a Wolf, who  said good-day; but he looked so hungrily out of his great eyes, as if  he would have eaten her up had she not been on the high road.    So her grandmother said, \"We will shut the door, and then he cannot  get in.\"    Soon after, up came the Wolf, who tapped, and exclaimed, \"I am Little  Red Riding Hood, grandmother; I have some roast meat for you.\" But  they kept quite quiet, and did not open the door; so the Wolf, after  looking several times round the house, at last jumped on to the roof,  thinking to wait till Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and  then to creep after her and eat her in the darkness.    The old woman, however, saw what the villain intended. There stood  before the door a large stone trough, and she said to Little Red  Riding Hood, \"Take this bucket, dear: yesterday I boiled some meat in  this water, now pour it into the stone trough.\" Then the Wolf sniffed  the smell of the meat, and his mouth watered, and he wished very much  to taste.    At last he stretched his neck too far over, so that he lost his  balance, and fell down from the roof, right into the great trough  below, and there he was drowned.    [Illustration: \"WITHOUT A WORD HE JUMPED ON TO THE BED AND GOBBLED UP  THE POOR OLD LADY.\"]    [Illustration]          THE WHITE FAWN      There was once upon a time a King and Queen who were perfectly happy,  with one exception, and that was that they had no child.    One day when the Queen was staying in a watering-place, some distance  from home, she was sitting by a fountain alone, sadly thinking of the  daughter she longed to have, when she perceived a crab coming in her  direction, who, to the Queen's surprise, addressed her thus:    \"Great Queen, if you will condescend to be conducted by a humble  crab, I will lead you to a Fairies' palace and your wish shall be  fulfilled.\"    \"I would certainly come with you,\" replied the Queen, \"but I am afraid  that I cannot walk backwards.\"    The crab smiled, and transforming herself into a beautiful little old  woman, said:    \"Now, madam, it is not necessary to go backwards. Come with me, and  I beg of you to look upon me as your friend.\" She then escorted the  Queen to the most magnificent palace that could possibly be imagined,  it was built entirely of diamonds.    In this superb place dwelt six Fairies who received the Queen with  the greatest respect, "]]]
