I asked myself, Could I descend upon the river-bed beneath me?  It was  impossible to say what precipices might prevent my doing so.  If I were  on the river-bed, dare I cross the river?  I am an excellent swimmer,  yet, once in that frightful rush of waters, I should be hurled  whithersoever it willed, absolutely powerless.  Moreover, there was my  swag; I should perish of cold and hunger if I left it, but I should  certainly be drowned if I attempted to carry it across the river.  These  were serious considerations, but the hope of finding an immense tract of  available sheep country (which I was determined that I would monopolise  as far as I possibly could) sufficed to outweigh them; and, in a few  minutes, I felt resolved that, having made so important a discovery as a  pass into a country which was probably as valuable as that on our own  side of the ranges, I would follow it up and ascertain its value, even  though I should pay the penalty of failure with life itself.  The more I  thought, the more determined I became either to win fame and perhaps  fortune, by entering upon this unknown world, or give up life in the  attempt.  In fact, I felt that life would be no longer valuable if I were  to have seen so great a prize and refused to grasp at the possible  profits therefrom.    I had still an hour of good daylight during which I might begin my  descent on to some suitable camping-ground, but there was not a moment to  be lost.  At first I got along rapidly, for I was on the snow, and sank  into it enough to save me from falling, though I went forward straight  down the mountain side as fast as I could; but there was less snow on  this side than on the other, and I had soon done with it, getting on to a  coomb of dangerous and very stony ground, where a slip might have given  me a disastrous fall.  But I was careful with all my speed, and got  safely to the bottom, where there were patches of coarse grass, and an  attempt here and there at brushwood: what was below this I could not see.  I advanced a few hundred yards farther, and found that I was on the brink  of a frightful precipice, which no one in his senses would attempt  descending.  I bethought me, however, to try the creek which drained the  coomb, and see whether it might not have made itself a smoother way.  In  a few minutes I found myself at the upper end of a chasm in the rocks,  something like Twll Dhu, only on a greatly larger scale; the creek had  found its way into it, and had worn a deep channel through a material  which appeared softer than that upon the other side of the mountain.  I  believe it must have been a different geological formation, though I  regret to say that I cannot tell what it was.    I looked at this rift in great doubt; then I went a little way on either  side of it, and found myself looking over the edge of horrible precipices  on to the river, which roared some four or five thousand feet below me.  I  dared not think of getting down at all, unless I committed myself to the  rift, of which I was hopeful when I reflected that the rock was soft, and  that the water might have worn its channel tolerably evenly through the  whole extent.  The darkness was increasing with every minute, but I  should have twilight for another half-hour, so I went into the chasm  (though by no means without fear), and resolved to return and camp, and  try some other path next day, should I come to any serious difficulty.  In  about five minutes I had completely lost my head; the side of the rift  became hundreds of feet in height, and overhung so that I could not see  the sky.  It was full of rocks, and I had many falls and bruises.  I was  wet through from falling into the water, of which there was no great  volume, but it had such force that I could do nothing against it; once I  had to leap down a not inconsiderable waterfall into a deep pool below,  and my swag was so heavy that I was very nearly drowned.  I had indeed a  hair's-breadth escape; but, as luck would have it, Providence was on my  side.  Shortly afterwards I began to fancy that the rift was getting  wider, and that there was more brushwood.  Presently I found myself on an  open grassy slope, and feeling my way a little farther along the stream,  I came upon a flat place with wood, where I could camp comfortably; which  was well, for it was now quite dark.    My first care was for my matches; were they dry?  The outside of my swag  had got completely wet; but, on undoing the blankets, I found things warm  and dry within.  How thankful I was!  I lit a fire, and was grateful for  its warmth and company.  I made myself some tea and ate two of my  biscuits: my brandy I did not touch, for I had little left, and might  want it when my courage failed me.  All that I did, I did almost  mechanically, for I could not realise my situation to myself, beyond  knowing that I was alone, and that return through the chasm which I had  just descended would be impossible.  It is a dreadful feeling that of  being cut off from all one's kind.  I was still full of hope, and built  golden castles for myself as soon as I was warmed with food and fire; but  I do not believe that any man could long retain his reason in such  solitude, unless he had the companionship of animals.  One begins  doubting one's own identity.    I remember deriving comfort even from the sight of my blankets, and the  sound of my watch ticking--things which seemed to link me to other  people; but the screaming of the wood-hens frightened me, as also a  chattering bird which I had never heard before, and which seemed to laugh  at me; though I soon got used to it, and before long could fancy that it  was many years since I had first heard it.    I took off my clothes, and wrapped my inside blanket about me, till my  things were dry.  The night was very still, and I made a roaring fire; so  I soon got warm, and at last could put my clothes on again.  Then I  strapped my blanket round me, and went to sleep as near the fire as I  could.    I dreamed that there was an organ placed in my master's wool-shed: the  wool-shed faded away, and the organ seemed to grow and grow amid a blaze  of brilliant light, till it became like a golden city upon the side of a  mountain, with rows upon rows of pipes set in cliffs and precipices, one  above the other, and in mysterious caverns, like that of Fingal, within  whose depths I could see the burnished pillars gleaming.  In the front  there was a flight of lofty terraces, at the top of which I could see a  man with his head buried forward towards a key-board, and his body  swaying from side to side amid the storm of huge arpeggioed harmonies  that came crashing overhead and round.  Then there was one who touched me  on the shoulder, and said, \"Do you not see? it is Handel\";--but I had  hardly apprehended, and was trying to scale the terraces, and get near  him, when I awoke, dazzled with the vividness and distinctness of the  dream.    A piece of wood had burned through, and the ends had fallen into the  ashes with a blaze: this, I supposed, had both given me my dream and  robbed me of it.  I was bitterly disappointed, and sitting up on my  elbow, came back to reality and my strange surroundings as best I could.    I was thoroughly aroused--moreover, I felt a foreshadowing as though my  attention were arrested by something more than the dream, although no  sense in particular was as yet appealed to.  I held my breath and waited,  and then I heard--was it fancy?  Nay; I listened again and again, and I  _did_ hear a faint and extremely distant sound of music, like that of an  AEolian harp, borne upon the wind which was blowing fresh and chill from  the opposite mountains.    The roots of my hair thrilled.  I listened, but the wind had died; and,  fancying that it must have been the wind itself--no; on a sudden I  remembered the noise which Chowbok had made in the wool-shed.  Yes; it  was that.    Thank Heaven, whatever it was, it was over now.  I reasoned with myself,  and recovered my firmness.  I became convinced that I had only been  dreaming more vividly than usual.  Soon I began even to laugh, and think  what a fool I was to be frightened at nothing, reminding myself that even  if I were to come to a bad end it would be no such dreadful matter after  all.  I said my prayers, a duty which I had too often neglected, and in a  little time fell into a really refreshing sleep, which lasted till broad  daylight, and restored me.  I rose, and searching among the embers of my  fire, I found a few live coals and soon had a blaze again.  I got  breakfast, and was delighted to have the company of several small birds,  which hopped about me and perched on my boots and hands.  I felt  comparatively happy, but I can assure the reader that I had had a far  worse time of it than I have told him; and I strongly recommend him to  remain in Europe if he can; or, at any rate, in some country which has  been explored and settled, rather than go into places where others have  not been before him.  Exploring is delightful to look forward to and back  upon, but it is not comfortable at the time, unless it be of such an easy  nature as not to deserve the name.          CHAPTER V: THE RIVER AND THE RANGE      My next business was to descend upon the river.  I had lost sight of the  pass which I had seen from the saddle, but had made such notes of it that  I could not fail to find it.  I was bruised and stiff, and my boots had  begun to give, for I had been going on rough ground for more than three  weeks; but, as the day wore on, and I found myself descending without  serious difficulty, I became easier.  In a couple of hours I got among  pine forests where there was little undergrowth, and descended quickly  till I reached the edge of another precipice, which gave me a great deal  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#6)"],[1,"to this point. Fortunately at this  moment the place was cleared by a pretty strong wind, but not entirely,  for all round it the smoke eddied from a thousand crannies; and now at  last we stood on the top of the solid roof (which looked like a hardened  mass of twisted dough), but which, however, projected so far outward,  that it was impossible to see the welling lava.    We ventured about twenty steps further, but the ground on which we stept  became hotter and hotter, while around us rolled an oppressive steam,  which obscured and hid the sun; the guide, who was a few steps in  advance of me, presently turned back, and seizing hold of me, hurried  out of this Stygian exhalation.    After we had refreshed our eyes with the clear prospect, and washed our  gums and throat with wine, we went round again to notice any other  peculiarities which might characterize this peak of hell, thus rearing  itself in the midst of a Paradise. I again observed attentively some  chasms, in appearance like so many vulcanic forges, which emitted no  smoke, but continually shot out a steam of hot glowing air. They were  all tapestried, as it were, with a kind of stalactite, which covered the  funnel to the top, with its knobs and chintz-like variation of colors.  In consequence of the irregularity of the forges, I found many specimens  of this sublimation hanging within reach, so that, with our staves and a  little contrivance, we were able to hack off a few, and to secure them.  I saw in the shops of the dealers in lava similar specimens, labeled  simply \"Lava\"; and I was delighted to have discovered that it was  volcanic soot precipitated from the hot vapor, and distinctly exhibiting  the sublimated mineral particles which it contained.          ANOTHER ASCENT[10]    BY CHARLES DICKENS      No matter that the snow and ice lie thick upon the summit of Vesuvius,  or that we have been on foot all day at Pompeii, or that croakers  maintain that strangers should not be on the mountain by night, in such  unusual season. Let us take advantage of the fine weather; make the best  of our way to Resina, the little village at the foot of the mountain;  prepare ourselves, as well as we can, on so short a notice, at the  guide's house, ascend at once, and have sunset half-way up, moonlight at  the top, and midnight to come down in!    At four o'clock in the afternoon, there is a terrible uproar in the  little stable-yard of Signor Salvatore, the recognized head guide, with  the gold band round his cap; and thirty under-guides who are all  scuffling and screaming at once, are preparing half-a-dozen saddled  ponies, three litters, and some stout staves, for the journey. Every one  of the thirty quarrels with the other twenty-nine, and frightens the six  ponies; and as much of the village as can possibly squeeze itself into  the little stable-yard, participates in the tumult, and gets trodden on  by the cattle.    After much violent skirmishing, and more noise than would suffice for  the storming of Naples, the procession starts. The head guide, who is  liberally paid for all the attendants, rides a little in advance of the  party; the other thirty guides proceed on foot. Eight go forward with  the litters that are to be used by and by; and the remaining  two-and-twenty beg. We ascend, gradually, by stony lanes like rough  broad flights of stairs, for some time. At length, we leave these, and  the vineyards on either side of them, and emerge upon a bleak, bare  region where the lava lies confusedly, in enormous rusty masses; as if  the earth had been plowed up by burning thunder-bolts. And now, we halt  to see the sunset. The change that falls upon the dreary region and on  the whole mountain, as its red light fades, and the night comes on--and  the unutterable solemnity and dreariness that reign around, who that has  witnessed it, can ever forget!    It is dark, when after winding, for some time, over the broken ground,  we arrive at the foot of the cone, which is extremely steep, and seems  to rise, almost perpendicularly, from the spot where we dismount. The  only light is reflected from the snow, deep, hard, and white, with which  the cone is covered. It is now intensely cold, and the air is piercing.  The thirty-one have brought no torches, knowing that the moon will rise  before we reach the top. Two of the litters are devoted to the two  ladies; the third, to a rather heavy gentleman from Naples, whose  hospitality and good-nature have attached him to the expedition, and  determined him to assist in doing the honors of the mountain. The rather  heavy gentleman is carried by fifteen men; each of the ladies by  half-a-dozen. We who walk, make the best use of our staves; and so the  whole party begin to labor upward over the snow--as if they were toiling  to the summit of an antediluvian Twelfth-cake.    We are a long time toiling up; and the head guide looks oddly about him  when one of the company--not an Italian, tho an habitue of the mountain  for many years: whom we will call, for our present purpose, Mr. Pickle  of Portici--suggests that, as it is freezing hard, and the usual footing  of ashes is covered by the snow and ice, it will surely be difficult to  descend. But the sight of the litters above, tilting up, and down, and  jerking from this side to that, as the bearers continually slip, and  tumble, diverts our attention, more especially as the whole length of  the rather heavy gentleman is, at that moment, presented to us  alarmingly foreshortened, with his head downward.    The rising of the moon soon afterward, revives the flagging spirits of  the bearers. Stimulating each other with their usual watchword,  \"Courage, friend! It is to eat maccaroni!\" they press on, gallantly, for  the summit.    From tingeing the top of the snow above us with a band of light, and  pouring it in a stream through the valley below, while we have been  ascending in the dark, the moon soon lights the whole white mountain  side, and the broad sea down below, and tiny Naples in the distance, and  every village in the country round. The whole prospect is in this lovely  state, when we come upon the platform on the mountain-top--the region of  fire--an exhausted crater formed of great masses of gigantic cinders,  like blocks of stone from some tremendous waterfall, burned up; from  every chink and crevice of which, hot, sulfurous smoke is pouring out;  while, from another conical-shaped hill, the present crater, rising  abruptly from this platform at the end, great sheets of fire are  streaming forth; reddening the night with flame, blackening it with  smoke, and spotting it with red-hot stones and cinders, that fly up into  the air like feathers, and fall down like lead. What words can paint the  gloom and grandeur of this scene!    The broken ground; the smoke; the sense of suffocation from the sulfur;  the fear of falling down through the crevices in the yawning ground; the  stopping, every now and then, for somebody who is missing in the dark  (for the dense smoke now obscures the moon); the intolerable noise of  the thirty; and the hoarse roaring of the mountain; make it a scene of  such confusion, at the same time, that we reel again. But, dragging the  ladies through it, and across another exhausted crater to the foot of  the present volcano, we approach close to it on the windy side, and then  sit down among the hot ashes at its foot, and look up in silence;  faintly estimating the action that is going on within, from its being  full a hundred feet higher, at this minute, than it was six weeks ago.    There is something in the fire and roar, that generates an irresistible  desire to get nearer to it. We can not rest long, without starting off,  two of us on our hands and knees, accompanied by the head guide, to  climb to the brim of the flaming crater, and try to look in. Meanwhile,  the thirty yell, as with one voice, that it is a dangerous proceeding,  and call to us to come back; frightening the rest of the party out of  their wits.    What with their noise, and what with the trembling of the thin crust of  ground, that seems about to open underneath our feet and plunge us in  the burning gulf below (which is the real danger, if there be any); and  what with the flashing of the fire in our faces, and the shower of  red-hot ashes that is raining down, and the choking smoke and sulfur; we  may well feel giddy and irrational, like drunken men. But, we contrive  to climb up to the brim, and look down, for a moment, into the hell of  boiling fire below. Then, we all three come rolling down; blackened, and  singed, and scorched, and hot, and giddy; and each with his dress alight  in half-a-dozen places.    You have read, a thousand times, that the usual way of descending, is,  by sliding down the ashes; which, forming a gradually-increasing ledge  below the feet, prevent too rapid a descent. But, when we have crossed  the two exhausted craters on our way back, and are come to this  precipitous place, there is (as Mr. Pickle has foretold) no vestige of  ashes to be seen; the whole being a smooth sheet of ice.    In this dilemma, ten or a dozen of the guides cautiously join hands, and  make a chain of men; of whom the foremost beat, as well as they can, a  rough track with their sticks, down which we prepare to follow. The way  being fearfully steep, and none of the party--even of the thirty--being  able to keep their feet for six paces together, the ladies are taken out  of their litters, and placed, each between two careful persons; while  others of the thirty hold by their skirts, to prevent their falling  forward--a necessary precaution, tending to the immediate and hopeless  dilapidation of their apparel. The rather heavy gentleman is abjured to  leave his litter too, and be escorted in a similar manner; but he  resolves to be brought down as he was brought up, on the principle that  his fifteen bearers are not likely to tumble all at"]]]
