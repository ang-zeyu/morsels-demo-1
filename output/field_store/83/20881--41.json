He restored or enlarged  the monuments, regulated equitably the assessment of taxes and  charges, settled or dismissed the lawsuits between one town and another  concerning the appropriation of the water, or the possession of certain  territories, distributed fiefs which had fallen vacant, among his  faithful servants, and granted pensions to be paid out of the royal  revenues.*         * These details are not found on the historical monuments,       but are furnished to us by the description given in \"The       Book of Knowledge of what there is in the other world\" of       the course of the sun across the domain of the hours of       night; the god is there described as a Pharaoh passing       through his kingdom, and all that he does for his vassals,       the dead, is identical with what Pharaoh was accustomed to       do for his subjects, the living.    At length he re-entered Memphis, or one of his usual residences, where  fresh labours awaited him. He gave audience daily to all, whether high  or low, who were, or believed that they were, wronged by some official,  and who came to appeal to the justice of the master against the  injustice of his servant. If he quitted the palace when the cause  had been heard, to take boat or to go to the temple, he was not left  undisturbed, but petitions and supplications assailed him by the way.  In addition to this, there were the daily sacrifices, the despatch  of current affairs, the ceremonies which demanded the presence of the  Pharaoh, and the reception of nobles or foreign envoys. One would think  that in the midst of so many occupations he would never feel time hang  heavy on his hands. He was, however, a prey to that profound _ennui_  which most Oriental monarchs feel so keenly, and which neither the cares  nor the pleasures of ordinary life could dispel. Like the Sultans of the  \"Arabian Nights,\" the Pharaohs were accustomed to have marvellous tales  related to them, or they assembled their councillors to ask them to  suggest some fresh amusement: a happy thought would sometimes strike one  of them, as in the case of him who aroused the interest of Snofrui by  recommending him to have his boat manned by young girls barely clad in  large-meshed network.    [Illustration: 037.jpg PHARAOH IN HIS HAREM]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin.    All his pastimes were not so playful. The Egyptians by nature were not  cruel, and we have very few records either in history or tradition of  bloodthirsty Pharaohs; but the life of an ordinary individual was of so  little value in their eyes, that they never hesitated to sacrifice it,  even for a caprice. A sorcerer had no sooner boasted before Kheops of  being able to raise the dead, than the king proposed that he should try  the experiment on a prisoner whose head was to be forthwith cut off.  The anger of Pharaoh was quickly excited, and once aroused, became an  all-consuming fire; the Egyptians were wont to say, in describing its  intensity, \"His Majesty became as furious as a panther.\" The wild beast  often revealed itself in the half-civilized man.    The royal family was very numerous. The women were principally chosen  from the relatives of court officials of high rank, or from the  daughters of the great feudal lords; there were, however, many strangers  among them, daughters or sisters of petty Libyan, Nubian, or Asiatic  kings; they were brought into Pharaoh's house as hostages for the  submission of their respective peoples. They did not all enjoy the same  treatment or consideration, and their original position decided their  status in the harem, unless the amorous caprice of their master should  otherwise decide. Most of them remained merely concubines for life,  others were raised to the rank of \"royal spouses,\" and at least one  received the title and privileges of \"great spouse,\" or queen. This was  rarely accorded to a stranger, but almost always to a princess born in  the purple, a daughter of Ra, if possible a sister of the Pharaoh, and  who, inheriting in the same degree and in equal proportion the flesh and  blood of the Sun-god, had, more than others, the right to share the bed  and throne of her brother.*         * It would seem that Queen Mirisonkhu, wife of Khephren, was       the daughter of Kheops, and consequently her husband's       sister.    [Illustration: 039.jpg PHARAOH GIVES SOLEMN AUDIENCE TO ONE OF HIS  MINISTERS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Lepsius. The king is Amenothes       III. (XVIIIth. dynasty).    She had her own house, and a train of servants and followers as large  as those of the king; while the women of inferior rank were more or less  shut up in the parts of the palace assigned to them, she came and went  at pleasure, and appeared in public with or without her husband. The  preamble of official documents in which she is mentioned, solemnly  recognizes her as the living follower of Horus, the associate of  the Lord of the Vulture and the Uraeus, the very gentle, the very  praiseworthy, she who sees her Horus, or Horus and Sit, face to face.  Her union with the god-king rendered her a goddess, and entailed upon  her the fulfilment of all the duties which a goddess owed to a god. They  were varied and important. The woman, indeed, was supposed to combine  in herself more completely than a man the qualities necessary for the  exercise of magic, whether legitimate or otherwise: she saw and heard  that which the eyes and ears of man could not perceive; her voice, being  more flexible and piercing, was heard at greater distances; she was by  nature mistress of the art of summoning or banishing invisible  beings. While Pharaoh was engaged in sacrificing, the queen, by her  incantations, protected him from malignant deities, whose interest it  was to divert the attention of the celebrant from holy things: she put  them to flight by the sound of prayer and sistrum, she poured libations  and offered perfumes and flowers. In processions she walked behind her  husband, gave audience with him, governed for him while he was engaged  in foreign wars, or during his progresses through his kingdom: such  was the work of Isis while her brother Osiris was conquering the world.  Widowhood did not always entirely disqualify her. If she belonged to the  solar race, and the new sovereign was a minor, she acted as regent by  hereditary right, and retained the authority for some years longer.*         * The best-known of these queen regencies is that which       occurred during the minority of Thutmosis III., about the       middle of the XVIIIth dynasty. Queen Tuau also appears to       have acted as regent for her son Ramses II. during his first       Syrian campaigns.    It occasionally happened that she had no posterity, or that the child  of another woman inherited the crown. In that case there was no law or  custom to prevent a young and beautiful widow from wedding the son, and  thus regaining her rank as Queen by a marriage with the successor of her  deceased husband. It was in this manner that, during the earlier part  of the IVth dynasty, the Princess Mirtittefsi ingratiated herself  successively in the favour of Snofrui and Kheops.* Such a case did not  often arise, and a queen who had once quitted the throne had but little  chance of again ascending it. Her titles, her duties, her supremacy over  the rest of the family, passed to a younger rival: formerly she had been  the active companion of the king, she now became only the nominal spouse  of the god,** and her office came to an end when the god, of whom she  had been the goddess, quitting his body, departed heavenward to rejoin  his father the Sun on the far-distant horizon.    Children swarmed in the palace, as in the houses of private individuals:  in spite of the number who died in infancy, they were reckoned by tens,  sometimes by the hundred, and more than one Pharaoh must have been  puzzled to remember exactly the number and names of his offspring.***         * M. de Rouge was the first to bring this fact to light in       his _Becherches sur les monuments qu'on peut attribuer aux       six premieres dynasties de Manethon,_ pp. 36-38. Mirtittefsi       also lived in the harem of Khephren, but the title which       connects her with this king--_Amahhit_, the vassal--proves       that she was then merely a nominal wife; she was probably by       that time, as M. de Rouge says, of too advanced an age to       remain the favourite of a third Pharaoh.         ** The title of \"divine spouse\" is not, so far as we know at       present, met with prior to the XVIIIth dynasty. It was given       to the wife of a living monarch, and was retained by her       after his death; the divinity to whom it referred was no       other than the king himself.         *** This was probably so in the case of the Pharaoh Ramses       II., more than one hundred and fifty of whose children, boys       and girls, are known to us, and who certainly had others       besides of whom we know nothing.

The origin and rank of their mothers greatly influenced the condition  of the children. No doubt the divine blood which they took from a common  father raised them all above the vulgar herd but those connected with  the solar line on the maternal side occupied a decidedly much higher  position than the rest: as long as one of these was living, none of his  less nobly-born brothers might aspire to the crown.*         * Proof of this fact is furnished us, in so far as the       XVIIIth dynasty is concerned, by the history of the       immediate successors of Thutmosis I., the Pharaohs Thutmosis       IL, Thutmosis III., Queen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"lions  have disappeared completely since the last twenty years.

[Illustration: 035.jpg a herd of onagers pursued by dogs and wounded by  arrows.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in the British       Museum.    The elephant seems to have roamed for some time over the steppes of  the middle Euphrates;* there is no indication of its presence after the  XIIIth century before our era, and from that time forward it was merely  an object of curiosity brought at great expense from distant countries.  This is not the only instance of animals which have disappeared in  the course of centuries; the rulers of Nineveh were so addicted to the  pursuit of the urus that they ended by exterminating it. Several sorts  of panthers and smaller felidae had their lairs in the thickets of  Mesopotamia. The wild ass and onager roamed in small herds between the  Balikh and the Tigris. Attempts were made, it would seem, at a very  early period to tame them and make use of them to draw chariots; but  this attempt either did not succeed at all, or issued in such uncertain  results, that it was given up as soon as other less refractory animals  were made the subjects of successful experiment.         * The existence of the elephant in Mesopotamia and Northern       Syria is well established by the Egyptian inscription of       Amenemhabi in the XVth century before our era.    [Illustration: 036.jpg THE CHIEF DOMESTIC ANIMALS OP THE REGIONS OF THE  EUPHRATES.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian bas-relief from       Kouyunjik.    The wild boar, and his relative, the domestic hog, inhabited the  morasses. Assyrian sculptors amused themselves sometimes by representing  long gaunt sows making their way through the cane-brakes, followed by  their interminable offspring. The hog remained here, as in Egypt, in  a semi-tamed condition, and the people were possessed of only a small  number of domesticated animals besides the dog--namely, the ass, ox,  goat, and sheep; the horse and camel were at first unknown, and were  introduced at a later period.*    [Illustration: 037.jpg THE SOW AND HER LITTER MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH A  BED OF REEDS.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from Kouyunjik.         * The horse is denoted in the Assyrian texts by a group of       signs which mean \"the ass of the East,\" and the camel by       other signs in which the character for \"ass\" also appears.       The methods of rendering these two names show that the       subjects of them were unknown in the earliest times; the       epoch of their introduction is uncertain. A chariot drawn by       horses appears on the \"Stele of the Vultures.\" Camels are       mentioned among the booty obtained from the Bedouin of the       desert.    We know nothing of the efforts which the first inhabitants--Sumerians  and Semites--had to make in order to control the waters and to bring the  land under culture: the most ancient monuments exhibit them as already  possessors of the soil, and in a forward state of civilization.* Their  chief cities were divided into two groups: one in the south, in the  neighbourhood of the sea; the other in a northern direction, in the  region where the Euphrates and Tigris are separated from each other by  merely a narrow strip of land. The southern group consisted of seven, of  which Eridu lay nearest to the coast. This town stood on the left bank  of the Euphrates, at a point which is now called Abu-Shahrein. A little  to the west, on the opposite bank, but at some distance from the stream,  the mound of Mugheir marks the site of Uru, the most important, if not  the oldest, of the southern cities. Lagash occupied the site of the  modern Telloh to the north of Eridu, not far from the Shatt-el-Hai;  Nisin and Mar, Larsam and Uruk, occupied positions at short distances  from each other on the marshy ground which extends between the Euphrates  and the Shatt-en-Nil. The inscriptions mention here and there other  less important places, of which the ruins have not yet been  discovered--Zirlab and Shurippak, places of embarkation at the mouth  of the Euphrates for the passage of the Persian Gulf; and the island of  Dilmun, situated some forty leagues to the south in the centre of the  Salt Sea,--\"Nar-Marratum.\" The northern group comprised Nipur, the  \"incomparable;\" Barsip, on the branch which flows parallel to the  Euphrates and falls into the Bahr-i-Nedjif; Babylon, the \"gate of the  god,\" the \"residence of life,\" the only metropolis of the Euphrates  region of which posterity never lost a reminiscence; Kishu, Kuta,  Agade;** and lastly the two Sipparas, that of Shamash and that of  Anunit. The earliest Chaldaean civilization was confined almost entirely  to the two banks of the Lower Euphrates: except at its northern  boundary, it did not reach the Tigris, and did not cross this river.  Separated from the rest of the world--on the east by the marshes which  border the river in its lower course, on the north by the badly watered  and sparsely inhabited table-land of Mesopotamia, on the west by the  Arabian desert--it was able to develop its civilization, as Egypt had  done, in an isolated area, and to follow out its destiny in peace. The  only point from which it might anticipate serious danger was on the  east, whence the Kashshi and the Elamites, organized into military  states, incessantly harassed it year after year by their attacks. The  Kashshi were scarcely better than half-civilized mountain hordes, but  the Elamites were advanced in civilization, and their capital, Susa,  vied with the richest cities of the Euphrates, Uru and Babylon, in  antiquity and magnificence.         * For an ideal picture of what may have been the beginnings       of that civilization, see Delitzsch, Die Entstehung des       altesten Schriflssystems, p. 214, et seq. I will not enter       into the question as to whether it did or did not come by       sea to the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris. The legend of       the fish-god Oannes (Berossus, frag. 1), which seems to       conceal some indication on the subject, is merely a       mythological tradition, from which it would be wrong to       deduce historical conclusions.         ** Agade, or Agane, has been identified with one of the two       towns of which Sippara is made up, more especially with that       which was called Anunit Sippara; the reading Agadi, Agacle,       was especially assumed to lead to its identification with       the Accad of _Genesis x. 10_, and with the Akkad of native       tradition. This opinion has been generally abandoned by       Assyriologists, and Agane has not yet found a site. Was it       only a name for Babylon?    [Illustration: 040.jpg MAP OF CHALDAEA]    There was nothing serious to fear from the Guti, on the branch of the  Tigris to the north-east, or from the Shuti to the north of these; they  were merely marauding tribes, and, however troublesome they might be  to their neighbours in their devastating incursions, they could not  compromise the existence of the country, or bring it into subjection.  It would appear that the Chaldseans had already begun to encroach upon  these tribes and to establish colonies among them--El-Ashshur on the  banks of the Tigris, Harran on the furthest point of the Mesopotamian  plain, towards the sources of the Balikh. Beyond these were vague and  unknown regions--Tidanum, Martu, the sea of the setting sun, the vast  territories of Milukhkha and Magan.* Egypt, from the time they were  acquainted with its existence, was a semi-fabulous country at the ends  of the earth.         * The question concerning Milukhkha and Magan has exercised       Assyriologists for twenty years. The prevailing opinion       appears to be that which identifies Magan with the Sinaitic       Peninsula, and Milukhkha with the country to the north of       Magan as far as the Wady Arish and the Mediterranean; others       maintain, not the theory of Delitzsch, according to whom       Magan and Milukhkha are synonyms for Shumir and Akkad, and       consequently two of the great divisions of Babylonia, but an       analogous hypothesis, in which they are regarded as       districts to the west of the Euphrates, either in Chaldaean       regions or on the margin of the desert, or even in the       desert itself towards the Sinaitic Peninsula. What we know       of the texts induces me, in common with H. Rawlinson, to       place these countries on the shores of the Persian Gulf,       between the mouth of the Euphrates and the Bahrein islands;       possibly the Makse and the Melangitso of classical       historians and geographers were the descendants of the       people of Magan (Makan) and Milukhkha (Melugga), who had       been driven towards the entrance to the Persian Gulf by some       such event as the increase in these regions of the Kashdi       (Chaldaeans). The names, emigrated to the western parts of       Arabia and to the Sinaitic Peninsula in after-times, as the       name of India passed to America in the XVIth century of our       era.    How long did it take to bring this people out of savagery, and to  build up so many flourishing cities? The learned did not readily resign  themselves to a confession of ignorance on the subject. As they  had depicted the primordial chaos, the birth of the gods, and their  struggles over the creation, so they related unhesitatingly everything  which had happened since the creation of mankind, and they laid claim to  being able to calculate the number of centuries which lay between their  own day and the origin of things. The tradition to which most credence  was attached in the Greek period at Babylon, that which has been  preserved for us in the histories of Berossue, asserts that"]]]
