Here he delivered over his carved  joints to the three ugly creatures which he knew as his children and  thought the world of, and appeared next flying low and quickly back to  the garden.  That is to say, he had contrived to slip from the nest so  secretly that that was the first time he showed.    A sparrow-hawk, worried with a family of her own, took occasion to  chase him as he flew, and he arrived in among the young lime-trees that  backed the garden, switchbacking--that was one of his tricks of escape,  made possible by a long tail--and yelling fit to raise the world.  The  sparrow-hawk's skinny yellow claw, thrust forward, was clutching thin  air an inch behind his central tail-feathers, but that was all she got  of him--just thin air.  There was no crash as he hurled into the green  maze; but she, failing to swerve exactly in time, made a mighty crash,  and retired somewhat dazed, thankful that she retained two whole wings  to fly with.  There is no room for big-winged sparrow-hawks in close  cover, anyway, and Blackie, who was born to the leafy green ways, knew  that.    Blackie's yells had called up, as if by magic, a motley crowd of  chaffinches, hedge-sparrows, wrens, robins, &c., from nowhere at all,  and they could be seen whirling in skirmishing order--not too  close--about the retreating foe.  Blackie himself needed no more  sparrow-hawk for a bit, and preferred to sit and look on.  If the  little fools chose to risk their lives in the excitement of mobbing,  let them.  His business was too urgent.    Twenty lightning glances around seemed to show that no death was on the  lurk near by.  Also, a quick inspection of other birds' actions--he  trusted to them a good deal--appeared to confirm this.    Then he flew down to the lawn, and almost immediately had a worm by the  tail.  Worms object to being so treated, and this one protested  vigorously.  Also, when pulled, they may come in halves.  So Blackie  did not pull _too_ much.  He jumped up, and, while he was in the air,  scraped the worm up with his left foot, or it may have been both feet.  The whole thing was done in the snap of a finger, however, almost too  quickly to be seen.    The worm, once up, was a dead one.  Blackie seemed to kill it so  quickly as almost to hide the method used.  In a few seconds more it  was a carved worm in three or four pieces--an unnice sight, but far  more amenable to reason that way.    Blackie was in rather long grass, and nerve-rackingly helpless, by the  same token.  He could not see anything that was coming.  Wherefore  every few seconds he had to stand erect and peer over the grass-tops.  It made no difference to the worm, however; it was carved just the same.    Blackie now hopped farther on in search of more worms, but found a big  piece of bread instead.  It was really the hen-chaffinch who found the  bread, and he who commandeered it from her.  Now he disclosed one fact,  and that was that bread would do for his children as well as worms.  Anyhow, he stuffed his beak about half up with bread, returned for the  pieces of worm, collected these, and retired up into the black cover of  a fir-tree.    No doubt he was expected to go right home with that load, then and  there.  Even a cock-blackbird with young, however, must feed, and, if  one judged by the excess amount of energy--if that were possible--used  up, must feed more than usual.  That seemed to be why he hid his whole  load in the crook of a big bough, and, returning to the lawn, ate  bread--he could wait to catch no worms for his own use, it appeared--as  fast as he could.  Three false alarms sent him precipitantly into his  tree upon this occasion, and one real alarm--a passing boy--caused a  fourth retreat.    These operations were not performed in a moment, and by the time he got  back to his nest--mind, he had to contrive to approach it so that he  was seen by nobody, and his was a conspicuous livery, too--his children  appeared to be in the last stages of exhaustion.  That, however, is  young birds all over; they expect their parents to be mere  feeding-machines, guaranteed to produce so many meals to the hour, and  hang the difficulties and the risks.    There was no sign of Blackie's wife.  Presumably she was working just  as hard on her own \"beat\" as he had been on his--their hunting-grounds  were separate, though they joined--and would soon be back.    Blackie did not wait.  He managed again the miracle of getting away  from his nest without appearing to do so, and next turned up on the  summer-house roof.  Fatherlike, he thought he had done enough for a  bit, and would enjoy a \"sunning reaction\" on the summerhouse roof.  It  was rather a good place, a look-out tower from which he could slip over  the side into the hedges, which met at the corner where it was, if  trouble turned up.    Trouble did turn up, but not quite what he had expected.  He had been  sitting there, wing-stretching, leg-stretching, and \"preening\" his  feathers, and had finally left off just to sit and do nothing,  when--lo! his wife popped up over the side without warning, and right  upon him.    She was very dark brown, not black, and had a paler throat than the  palish throat of most hen blackbirds--nearly white, in fact.  She said  nothing.  Nor did Blackie, but he looked very uncomfortable.  She did  more than say nothing.  She went for him, beak first, and very angrily  indeed; and he, not waiting to receive her, fled down to the lawn, and  began worm-hunting for dear life.  A whole lecture could not have said  more.    Mrs. Blackie remained on the roof for about a minute, looking round,  and then flew off to her own hunting-ground.  She was wilder and less  trusting of the world than Blackie, and did not care for his lawn in  full view of the house windows.  And Blackie did not even stop his work  to watch her go.  Apparently they had, previously in their married  life, arrived at a perfect understanding.    This time, too, Blackie got a big and a small worm.  The small he  coiled like a rope, and held up towards the base of his beak; the big  he carved up into sections, which he held more towards the tip.  The  large ones, it seemed, were too awkward and lively simply to carry off  rolled up whole.    The journey that followed was a fearful one in Blackie's life, for he  met half-way the very last foe in the world he was expecting--namely,  an owl.  Truly, it was a very small owl, scarce bigger than himself;  but it was an owl, and, like all its tribe, armed to the teeth.  Men  called it a little owl.  That was its name--little owl.  Blackie didn't  care what men called it; he knew it only as one of the hundred or so  shapes that death assumed for his benefit.    Just at that time it happened to be cloudy, and little owls often hunt  by day.  But how was Blackie to know that, little owls being a  comparatively new introduction into those parts?    Blackie screamed and fled.  The owl did not scream, but fled,  too--after Blackie.  Blackie had no means of judging how close _that_  foe was behind by the whir of its wings.  Owls' wings don't talk, as a  rule; they have a patent silencer, so to speak, in the fluffy-edged  feathers.  Therefore Blackie was forced to do his best in breaking the  speed record, and trust to luck.    It was a breathless and an awful few seconds, and it seemed to him like  a few hours.  The owl came up behind, going like a cloud-shadow, and  about as fast, and Blackie, glancing over his shoulder, I suppose,  yelled afresh.  The terror was so very close.    Then Blackie remembered another excavation, just like the one his nest  was in, a little off his course to the left, and he tacked towards it,  twisting his course wonderfully, thanks to the long tail.  And the owl  lost a foot on the turn.  I think it was expecting Blackie to make for  the hedge at all costs.  But, be that as it may, that foot was never  made up again, for Blackie vanished into the trench next instant, like  a blown-out light, and, though the hunter searched for him carefully,  he never put in an appearance again while that owl was within sight of  the place.    [Illustration: \"The owl lost a foot on the turn\"]    All signs of uproar on the passing of the little owl had died down some  time before Blackie turned up again, and then it was in the garden, so  he must have got from the tunnel unseen.    He still hung gamely to the food for his young, and now made another  attempt to deliver that food where it belonged.  He was half-way there,  indeed, before he saw the boys--three boys--with two rows of birds'  eggs threaded on strings.  They were passing so close to the trench  that one nearly fell into it, and, of course, any one could see that  they were bird-nesting.    Blackie swerved off sharply to the far hedge, his heart nearly bursting  with anxiety, little knowing that the boys had never even thought of  looking in the trench for nests.  It seemed the last place in the world  to find one.  It may have been, moreover, that he feared that his wife  was home, in which case she might have lost her head, and, dashing out  with a scream, \"blown the whole gaff,\" as they say in the vernacular.    Apparently madam was not at home, by good luck, for the boys passed,  and Blackie once more executed the magic of getting into his nest  without seeming to do so.  And here he stayed.  Dusk was setting in,  and his young were fourteen days old.  They showed it in their  disobedience, and were not in the least inclined to keep as quiet as  they should, considering their father had but just warned them, in his  own way, to \"lie doggo,\" because of the gray shape he had seen sliding  out into the field, a gray shape which was a cat.    They were more like thrushes than blackbirds, those youngsters, with  their speckly fawn breasts; and they were not like the adults of either  in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#6)"],[1,"case vibrate with the tones struck; so  you must examine the panels, lock, hinges, soft pedal bar (in square),  in fact all parts of the case and woodwork for the location of the  trouble. Once found, the remedy will suggest itself. The greatest  difficulty is to locate the cause. Very frequently this will be found  entirely outside of the piano; a loose window glass, picture glass,  lamp or other article of furniture in the room may respond to a  particular tone or its octave. We have never found the sympathetic  rattle in the action; it has rattles, but not of this character. Any  other defect which may be found under this head will only require the  exercise of a little mechanical ingenuity to suggest a remedy.      REGULATING AND REPAIRING THE UPRIGHT ACTION.    (Use cut of upright action for reference in following study.)    We will begin with the key and take up each part of the action in the  succession in which motion is transmitted.    1. _Key_.--Keys stick; that is, after being struck, they fail to come  up quickly, if at all. First ascertain if the trouble is really in the  key, or in the upper part of the action. To do this, lift the  extension or wippen until the upper part of the action is entirely  free from the key, so that you may test the key independently. Some  keys are leaded so that they will fall in front of the balance rail,  others so that they will fall back of it; in either case, lift the low  end and let go, to see if it will fall by its own weight. If it seems  quite free, you may know the trouble is not in the key; you will also  find that when you release the extension or wippen, it will not fall  readily, showing that the trouble lies in the upper part.    If the trouble is found in the key, examine the guide pin. See if it  is placed in a direct line with the key. If so, and it still binds,  enlarge the hole by pressing the wood back slightly with some  wedge-shaped instrument, if you have not a pair of the key pliers  which are used for this purpose. See that the cloth, with which the  hole is bushed, is not loose and wrinkled. Do not oil or grease the  guide pin unless such treatment has been previously resorted to, as  the polished pin will work more freely in the dry cloth. Do not pinch  hard on the pin with rough pliers and spoil the polished surface.    Sometimes you will find one key warped so that it rubs on the next, in  which case, plane off a slight shaving to free it. Sometimes changing  the position of the guide pin will straighten or level the key and  make it work all right.    The balance pin is subject to some of the same difficulties as the  guide pin. See that it sets properly and is not bound by the mortise.    Sometimes a splinter will be found on one side of a key where the lead  has been put in. A piece of any foreign material between two keys  generally causes both to stick.    Where the action is too deep, that is, the keys go down farther than  they ought, place cardboard washers under the felt ones around the  guide pin, or raise the felt strip under back end of keys.    Where the action is too shallow, place thin washers under those around  the balance pin. When this is done, the whole action must be regulated  accordingly, as this alteration will make a change in the working of  the upper part of the action.    2. _The Bottom or Capstan_.--This should be so adjusted that when the  key falls back to its rest position, the point of the jack will just  spring into its place in the nose of the hammer butt. If held too  high, the jack fails to catch in the nose, and the key may be struck  without producing any effect on the hammer. When the bottom or capstan  is too low, the point of the jack will be some distance below the  notch, which will cause what is known as lost motion, it being  necessary to depress the key a portion of its depth before the jack  can act upon the hammer. Depress the key slowly, watching the hammer,  and the fault will be discovered.    After a piano has been used for some time, the keys that are struck  most frequently (those in the middle of the instrument) will be found  to have this fault. The felts under the keys and those which are  between the working parts of the action become compressed or worn so  that the jack will be found to set so low that there will be lost  motion in the key. In this case, loosen one of the screws in the  bottom and turn the other down so as to move the jack upward until  nearly all lost motion is taken up. A little play is generally  necessary, but very little. In case the action has a capstan, simply  turn it upward.    3. _Back Check_.--Blocking is most usually caused by the back check  being too near the back catch, so that when the key is struck, the  back check holds the hammer against the string. This should be seen  after raising the bottom or capstan as above referred to. It will be  observed that when this is done on account of the wear of the felts,  the back check will stand much nearer the back catch than it did  before, and will need bending back so as to give the hammer plenty of  \"rebound.\" A steel instrument with properly shaped notches at the  point, called a regulator, is used for bending wires in regulating the  action. See that the wires stand as nearly in line as is possible. In  old actions that are considerably worn, however, you will be obliged  to alter some more than others.    4. _Bridle and Bridle Wire_.--In putting in a new bridle, it should be  doubled over at the end and secured to the hammer butt by a small  tack. Be sure you get it exactly the same length as the others;  otherwise it will be necessary to bend the bridle wire out of line.  Some tuners glue the bridle around the back catch stem, but the above  method is preferable.    The purpose of the bridle is to jerk the hammer back quickly and the  wire must be set, neither so far back as to check the stroke of the  hammer, nor so far forward that the bridle is too slack to draw upon  the hammer.    5. _Jack_.--The jack itself seldom gets out of order. So long as its  flange does not come unglued in the wippen, or its spring get out of  place or broken, or get tight in its joint, it will need nothing. Its  adjustment and action is controlled by the bottom or capstan, and the  regulating button.    6. _Regulating Button_.--This button determines the point in the  stroke of the hammer where the jack flies off from the nose of the  butt. If the button is too high, the jack does not fly off soon  enough, and the result is, that the hammer either blocks against the  string or bounces from the jack after the stroke has been made,  striking the string a second or third time from one stroke of the key.  The felt punching on the lower side of the button often wears until  this trouble prevails. Lower the button by turning down the screw on  top of the regulator rail; if lowered too far, however, the action is  weakened by causing the jack to fly off too soon, without giving the  hammer a sufficient impulse. A regulating screwdriver is used for  this, but in its absence, a wire hook, similar to a shoe buttoner,  will turn the screw.    The block rail is properly adjusted at the factory and requires no  attention.    7. _Hammer Butt_.--The felts and leather on the heel of the hammer  butt wear out and must be replaced. The felt cushion, that is lowest  and farthest to the left (see illustration), is the one that wears out  first. The jack, in returning to the notch, strikes this cushion, and  in time wears it away so that the jack in returning strikes the wood  of the hammer butt, producing a sharp click, which is very annoying,  to say the least. This click is heard at the instant the key rises to  its rest position. Sometimes, however, a similar click is produced by  the top of the key striking the board which is set over the keys, due  to the cloth being eaten off by moths, or a pencil or some other  article lying on the keys back of this board.    The center pin in the butt of some cheap actions is not held in the  butt by metal clip and screw, and if it gets loose so that it works  out, must be replaced by a larger pin. The size of center pins  generally used in the factory, is .050 of an inch in diameter; the  size for repairing should be .053. All of the best actions have the  set screw with which to make the pin fast in the butt.    Hammers stick when the center pin is too tight in the flange. The  bushing in the flange often expands. Some tuners oil at the ends of  the pin with kerosene or wet it with alcohol, which is very good; but  a better plan is to shrink the bushing with a drop of water on each  side so that it will penetrate the bushing. After this is done, the  piano cannot be used for a day or two, as the water first swells the  bushing, making all the hammers stick; but when they are dry again,  they will be found free. This may seem a curious method, but you need  not be afraid of it; it is the most effective.    Before leaving the hammer butt, see that the hammer spring is in its  place.    8. _Hammer Stem_.--These sometimes warp, split, crack, or come unglued  at the butt or hammer. If twisted so far that it does not strike  properly on the strings, or that it binds against the next hammer, the  best thing is to put in a new stem. If merely split or unglued, it may  be repaired. Sometimes a click is heard and it will seem impossible to  find the cause, the hammer and stem apparently perfect, but a close  examination will reveal a looseness in the stem somewhere.    In putting in a new shank, drill or chip out the old one, scrape the  holes out clean, take your measure carefully, and do not make the new  shank too tight, but large enough to fill the hole snugly. Apply glue  to the ends of the shank and also in the holes. Cedar is used in some  makes, but good maple is stronger, and is more generally used.    9. _Hammers_.--When too hard, soften with a felt pick. Do not raise  the felt up, but"]]]
