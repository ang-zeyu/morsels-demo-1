There is another form of English verbs, in which the infinitive mood is  joined to the verb do in its various inflections, which are therefore to be  learned in this place.    To do.    Indicative. Present.      Sing. I do, thou dost, he doth;    Plur. We do, ye do, they do.    Preterit.      Sing. I did, thou didst, he did;    Plur. We did, ye did, they did.    Preterit., &c. I have done, &c. I had done, &c.    Future. I shall or will do, &c.    Imperative.      Sing. Do thou, let him do;    Plur. Let us do, do ye, let them do.    Conjunctive. Present.      Sing. I do, thou do, he do;    Plur. We do, ye do, they do.    The rest are as in the Indicative.      Infinite. To do, to have done.    Participle present. Doing.    Participle preterit. Done.    Do is sometimes used superfluously, as I do love, I did love; simply for I  love, or I loved; but this is considered as a vitious mode of speech.    It is sometimes used emphatically; as,      I do love thee, and when I love thee not,    Chaos is come again.       Shakespeare.    It is frequently joined with a negative; as, I like her, but I do not love  her; I wished him success, but did not help him. This, by custom at least,  appears more easy than the other form of expressing the same sense by a  negative adverb after the verb, I like her, but love her not.    The imperative prohibitory is seldom applied in the second person, at least  in prose, without the word do; as, Stop him, but do not hurt him; Praise  beauty, but do not dote on it.    Its chief use is in interrogative forms of speech, in which it is used  through all the persons; as, Do I live? Dost thou strike me? Do they rebel?  Did I complain? Didst thou love her? Did she die? So likewise in negative  interrogations; Do I not yet grieve? Did she not die?    Do and did are thus used only for the present and simple preterit.    There is another manner of conjugating neuter verbs, which, when it is  used, may not improperly denominate them neuter passives, as they are  inflected according to the passive form by the help of the verb substantive  to be. They answer nearly to the reciprocal verbs in French; as, I am  risen, surrexi, Latin; Je me suis leve, French. I was walked out, exieram:  Je m'etois promene.    In like manner we commonly express the present tense; as, I am going, eo. I  am grieving, doleo, She is dying, illa moritur. The tempest is raging,  furit procella. I am pursuing an enemy, hostem insequor. So the other  tenses, as, We were walking, [Greek: etynchanomen peripatountes], I have  been walking, I had been walking, I shall or will be walking.    There is another manner of using the active participle, which gives it a  passive signification: as, The grammar is now printing, grammatica jam nunc  chartis imprimitur. The brass is forging, ara excuduntur. This is, in my  opinion, a vitious expression, probably corrupted from a phrase more pure,  but now somewhat obsolete: The book is a printing, The brass is a forging;  a being properly at, and printing and forging verbal nouns signifying  action, according to the analogy of this language.    The indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers frequently  confounded, or rather the conjunctive is wholly neglected, when some  convenience of versification docs not invite its revival. It is used among  the purer writers of former times after if, though, ere, before, till or  until, whether, except, unless, whatsoever, whomsoever, and words of  wishing; as, Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of  us, and Israel acknowledge us not.           *       *       *       *       *    Of IRREGULAR VERBS.    The English verbs were divided by Ben Jonson into four conjugations,  without any reason arising from the nature of the language, which has  properly but one conjugation, such as has been exemplified: from which all  deviations are to be considered as anomalies, which are indeed, in our  monosyllable Saxon verbs, and the verbs derived from them, very frequent;  but almost all the verbs which have been adopted from other languages,  follow the regular form.        Our verbs are observed by Dr. Wallis to be irregular only in the      formation of the preterit, and its participle. Indeed, in the      scantiness of our conjugations, there is scarcely any other place for      irregularity.    The first irregularity is a slight deviation from the regular form, by  rapid utterance or poetical contraction: the last syllable ed is often  joined with the former by suppression of e; as lov'd for loved; after c,  ch, sh, f, k, x, and after the consonants s, th, when more strongly  pronounced, and sometimes after m, n, r, if preceded by a short vowel, t is  used in pronunciation, but very seldom in writing rather than d; as plac't,  snatch't, fish't, wak't, dwel't, smel't for plac'd, snatch'd, fish'd,  wak'd, dwel'd, smel'd; or placed, snatched, fished, waked, dwelled,  smelled.    Those words which terminate in l or ll, or p, make their preterit in t,  even in solemn language; as crept, felt, dwelt; Sometimes after x, ed is  changed into t; as vext: this is not constant.    A long vowel is often changed into a short one; thus kept, slept, wept,  crept, swept; from the verbs to keep, to sleep, to weep, to creep, to  sweep.    Where d or t go before, the additional letter d or t, in this contracted  form, coalesce into one letter with the radical d or t: if t were the  radical, they coalesce into t; but if d were the radical, then into d or t,  as the one or the other letter may be more easily pronounced; as read, led,  spread, shed, shred, bid, hid, chid, fed, bled, bred, sped, strid, slid,  rid; from the verbs to read, to lead, to spread, to shed, to shread, to  bid, to hide, to chide, to feed, to bleed, to breed, to speed, to stride,  to slide, to ride. And thus cast, hurt, cost, burst, eat, beat, sweat, sit,  quit, smit, writ, bit, hit, met, shot; from the verbs to cast, to hurt, to  cost, to burst, to eat, to beat, to sweat, to sit, to quit, to smite, to  write, to bite, to hit, to meet, to shoot. And in like manner, lent, sent,  rent, girt; from the verbs to lend, to send, to rend, to gird.    The participle preterit or passive is often formed in en instead of ed; as,  been, taken, given, slain, known, from the verbs to be, to take, to give,  to slay, to know.    Many words have two or more participles, as not only written, bitten,  eaten, beaten, hidden, chidden, shotten, chosen, broken; but likewise writ,  bit, eat, beat, hid, chid, shot, chose, broke, are promiscuously used in  the participle, from the verbs to write, to bite, to eat, to beat, to hide,  to chide, to shoot, to choose, to break, and many such like.    In the same manner, sown, shewn, hewn, mown, loaden, laden, as well as  sow'd, show'd, hew'd, mow'd, loaded, laded, from the verbs to sow, to show,  to hew, to mow, to load, to lade.    Concerning these double participles it is difficult to give any rule; but  he shall seldom err who remembers, that when a verb has a participle  distinct from its preterit, as write, wrote, written, that distinct  participle is more proper and elegant, as The book is written, is better  than The book is wrote. Wrote however may be used in poetry; at least, if  we allow any authority to poets, who, in the exultation of genius, think  themselves perhaps entitled to trample on grammarians.    There are other anomalies in the preterit.    1. Win, spin, begin, swim, strike, stick, sing, sting, fling, ring, wring,  spring, swing, drink, sink, shrink, stink, come, run, find, bind, grind,  wind, both in the preterit imperfect and participle passive, give won,  spun, begun, swum, struck, stuck, sung, stung, flung, rung, wrung, sprung,  swung, drunk, sunk, shrunk, stunk, come, run, found, bound, ground, wound.  And most of them are also formed in the preterit by a, as began, sang,  rang, sprang, drank, came, ran, and some others; but most of these are now  obsolete. Some in the participle passive likewise take en, as stricken,  strucken, drunken, bounden.    2. Fight, teach, reach, seek, beseech, catch, buy, bring, think, work, make  fought, taught, raught, sought, besought, caught, bought, brought, thought,  wrought.    But a great many of these retain likewise the regular form, as teached,  reached, beseeched, catched, worked.    3. Take, shake, forsake, wake, awake, stand, break, speak, bear, shear,  swear, tear, wear, weave, cleave, strive, thrive, drive, shine, rise,  arise, smite, write, bide, abide, ride, choose, chuse, tread, get, beget,  forget, seethe, make in both preterit and participle took, shook, forsook,  woke, awoke, stood, broke, spoke, bore, shore, swore, tore, wore, wove,  clove, strove, throve, drove, shone, rose, arose, smote, wrote, bode,  abode, rode, chose, trode, got, begot, forgot, sod. But we say likewise,  thrive, rise, smit, writ, abid, rid. In the preterit some are likewise  formed by a, as brake, spake, bare, share, sware, tare, ware, clave, gat,  begat, forgat, and perhaps some others, but more rarely. In the participle  passive many of them are formed by en, as taken, shaken, forsaken, broken,  spoken, born, shorn, sworn, torn, worn, woven, cloven, thriven, driven,  risen, smitten, ridden, chosen, trodden, gotten, begotten, forgotten,  sodden. And many do likewise retain the analogy in both, as waked, awaked,  sheared, weaved, cleaved, abided, seethed.    4. Give, bid, sit, make in the preterit gave, bade, sate; in the participle  passive given, bidden, sitten; but in both bid.    5. Draw, know, grow, throw, blow, crow like a cock, fly, slay, see, ly,  make their preterit drew, knew, grew, threw, blew, crew, flew, slew, saw,  lay; their participles passive by n, drawn, known, grown, thrown, blown,  flown, slain, seen, lien, lain. Yet from flee is made fled; from go, went,  (from the old wend) the participle is gone.

These were to carry the  convicts, with a detachment of Marines in each, proportioned to the  nature of the service; the largest where resistance was most to be  expected, namely, in those ships which carried the greatest number of  male convicts. Altogether they formed a little squadron of eleven sail.    They only who know the nature of such equipments, and consider the  particular necessity in the present instance for a variety of articles  not usually provided, can judge properly of the time required for  furnishing out this fleet. Such persons will doubtless be the least  surprised at being told that nearly two months had elapsed before the  ships were enabled to quit this station, and proceed upon their voyage:  and that even then some few articles were either unprepared, or, through  misapprehension, neglected. The former circumstance took place respecting  some part of the cloathing for the female convicts, which, being  unfinished, was obliged to be left behind; the latter, with respect to  the ammunition of the marines, which was furnished only for immediate  service, instead of being, as the Commodore apprehended, completed at  their first embarkation: an omission which, in the course of the voyage,  was easily supplied.    This necessary interval was very usefully employed, in making the  convicts fully sensible of the nature of their situation; in pointing out  to them the advantages they would derive from good conduct, and the  certainty of severe and immediate punishment in case of turbulence or  mutiny. Useful regulations were at the same time established for the  effectual governing of these people; and such measures were taken as  could not fail to render abortive any plan they might be desperate enough  to form for resisting authority, seizing any of the transports, or  effecting, at any favourable period, an escape. We have, however, the  testimony of those who commanded, that their behaviour, while the ships  remained in port, was regular, humble, and in all respects suitable to  their situation: such as could excite neither suspicion nor alarm, nor  require the exertion of any kind of severity.    When the fleet was at length prepared for sailing, the complement of  convicts and marines on board the transports was thus arranged. The  Friendship carried a Captain and forty-four marines, subalterns and  privates, with seventy-seven male and twenty female convicts. The  Charlotte, a Captain and forty-three men, with eighty-eight male and  twenty female convicts. In the Alexander, were two Lieutenants and  thirty-five marines, with two hundred and thirteen convicts, all male. In  the Scarborough, a Captain and thirty-three marines, with male convicts  only, two hundred and eight in number. The Prince of Wales transport had  two Lieutenants and thirty marines, with an hundred convicts, all female.  And the Lady Penrhyn, a Captain, two Lieutenants, and only three privates,  with one hundred and two female convicts. Ten marines, of different  denominations, were also sent as supernumeraries on board the Sirius. The  whole complement of marines, including officers, amounted to two hundred  and twelve; besides which, twenty-eight women, wives of marines, carrying  with them seventeen children, were permitted to accompany their husbands.  The number of convicts was seven hundred and seventy-eight, of whom five  hundred and fifty-eight were men. Two, however, on board the Alexander,  received a full pardon before the departure of the fleet, and  consequently remained in England.    13 May 1787    Governor Phillip, on his arrival at the station, hoisted his flag on  board the Sirius, as Commodore of the squadron: and the embarkation being  completed, and the time requiring his departure, at day break on the 13th  of May, he gave the signal to weigh anchor. To the distance of about an  hundred leagues clear of the channel, his Majesty's frigate Hyena, of  twenty-four guns, was ordered to attend the fleet, in order to bring  intelligence of its passage through that most difficult part of the  voyage; with any dispatches which it might be requisite for the Governor  to send home.    20 May 1787    On the 20th of May, the ships being then in latitude 47 deg. 57', and  longitude 12 deg. 14' west of London, the Hyena returned. She brought,  however, no exact account of the state of the transports; for the sea at  that time ran so high, that the Governor found it difficult even to sit  to write, and quite impracticable to send on board the several ships for  exact reports of their situation, and of the behaviour of the convicts.  All, however, had not been perfectly tranquil; the convicts in the  Scarborough, confiding probably in their numbers, had formed a plan for  gaining possession of that ship, which the officers had happily detected  and frustrated. This information was received from them just before the  Hyena sailed, and the Governor had ordered two of the ringleaders on  board the Sirius for punishment. These men, after receiving a proper  chastisement, were separated from their party by being removed into  another ship, the Prince of Wales. No other attempt of this kind was made  during the voyage.    We may now consider the adventurers in this small fleet as finally  detached, for the present, from their native country; looking forward,  doubtless with very various emotions, to that unknown region, which, for  a time at least, they were destined to inhabit. If we would indulge a  speculative curiosity, concerning the tendency of such an enterprize,  there are few topics which would afford an ampler scope for conjecture.  The sanguine might form expectations of extraordinary consequences, and  be justified, in some degree, by the reflection, that from smaller, and  not more respectable beginnings, powerful empires have frequently arisen.  The phlegmatic and apprehensive might magnify to themselves the  difficulties of the undertaking, and prognosticate, from various causes,  the total failure of it. Both, perhaps, would be wrong. The opinion  nearest to the right was probably formed by the Governor himself, and  such others among the leaders of the expedition, as from native courage,  felt themselves superior to all difficulties likely to occur; and by  native good sense were secured from the seduction of romantic reveries.  To all it must appear a striking proof of the flourishing state of  navigation in the present age, and a singular illustration of its vast  progress since the early nautical efforts of mankind; that whereas the  ancients coasted with timidity along the shores of the Mediterranean, and  thought it a great effort to run across the narrow sea which separates  Crete from Egypt, Great Britain, without hesitation, sends out a fleet to  plant a settlement near the antipodes.    3 June 1787    The high sea which had impeded the intercourse between the ships, as they  were out of the reach of rocks and shoals, was not, in other respects, an  unfavourable circumstance. On the whole, therefore, the weather was  reckoned fine, and the passage very prosperous from Spithead to Santa  Cruz, in the Isle of Teneriffe, where the fleet anchored on the 3d of  June.      Chapter III.    June 1787    Reasons for touching at the Canary Isles--Precautions for preserving  Health--Their admirable Success--Some Account of the Canaries--Fables  respecting them--Attempt of a Convict to escape--Departure.    3 June 1787    The chief object proposed by Governor Phillip in touching at Teneriffe,  was the obtaining a fresh supply of water and vegetables. It was  adviseable also at this period to give the people such advantages and  refreshments, for the sake of health, as this place would readily supply,  but which can only be obtained on shore. In this, and every port, the  crews, soldiers, and convicts, were indulged with fresh meat, fruit,  vegetables, and every thing which could conduce to preserve them from the  complaints formerly inevitable in long voyages. The allowance was, to the  marines, a pound of bread, a pound of beef, and a pint of wine per man,  daily: the convicts had three quarters of a pound of beef, and of bread,  but no wine. The fruits obtained here were only figs and mulberries, but  these were plentiful and excellent. How successfully precautions of every  kind, tending to this great end, were employed throughout the voyage, the  reports of the number of sick and dead will sufficiently evince.    Captain Cook had very fully shown, how favourable such expeditions might  be made to the health of those engaged in them; and Governor Phillip was  happy enough to confirm the opinion, that the success of his great  predecessor, in this essential point, was not in any degree the effect of  chance, but arose from that care and attention of which he has humanely  given us the detail; and which, in similar circumstances, may generally  be expected to produce the same result. If the number of convicts who  died between the time of embarkation and the arrival of the fleet at this  place, should seem inconsistent with this assertion, it must be  considered that the deaths were confined entirely to that class of  people, many of whom were advanced in years, or labouring under diseases  contracted in prison or elsewhere, while they were yet on shore.    A week was passed at this place, during which time the weather was very  moderate, the thermometer not exceeding 70 deg. of Fahrenheit's scale. The  barometer stood at about 30 inches.    The Governor of the Canaries, at this time, was the Marquis de  Brancifort, by birth a Sicilian. He was resident as usual at Santa Cruz,  and paid to Governor Phillip, and the other officers, a polite attention  and respect equally honourable to all parties.
