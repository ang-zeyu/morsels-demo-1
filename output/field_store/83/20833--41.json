The wall monument of WILLIAM HEWIT (arms, a  fesse engrailed between three owls) had a recumbent figure of him in a  layman's gown. He died in 1599.    SIR WILLIAM COKAYNE (d. 1626) was a very rich Lord Mayor; high in the  confidence of James I., who constantly consulted him on business. He  was a munificent contributor to good works. It was said of him that  \"his spreading boughs gave shelter to some of the goodliest families  in England.\" From his daughters descended the Earls of Nottingham,  Pomfret, Holderness, Mulgrave, and Dover; the Duke of Ancaster, and  the Viscounts Fanshawe.    JOHN NEWCOURT, Dean of Auckland, Canon of St. Paul's, Doctor of Law  (d. 1485).    The handsome brass of ROGER BRABAZON, Canon of St. Paul's (d. 1498),  had a figure in a cope. At the foot was the scroll, \"Nunc Christe,  te petimus, miserere quaesumus: Qui venisti redimere perditos, noli  damnare redemptos.\"    Passing into the south side of the Lady Chapel, we come to two  more mediaeval Bishops of London: HENRY WENGHAM (1259-1262). He was  Chancellor to Henry III. Close to him was EUSTACE FAUCONBRIDGE, a  Royal Justiciary, and afterwards High Treasurer, and Bishop of London,  1221-1228.    WILLIAM RYTHYN, LL.D., was Rector of St. Faith's and Minor Canon of  the Cathedral (d. 1400).    RICHARD LYCHFIELD, Archdeacon both of Middlesex and of Bath, Canon  Residentiary of St. Paul's (d. 1496).    The tomb of SIR NICHOLAS BACON (1509-1579), Queen Elizabeth's famous  minister, and father of the great philosopher, had his recumbent  figure, and those of his two wives, Jane, daughter of William Fernley,  and Ann, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. The latter was the mother of  Francis. The Latin inscription on the tomb was most laudatory, and  reads as if it came from the same pen that wrote the dedication of the  _Advancement of Learning_.    Another of the Elizabethan worthies is SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM (d.  April 6th, 1590). The monument to him was placed on the wall, with a  long Latin biographical inscription and twenty lines of English verse.    Two other wall tablets in the same chapel commemorated other heroes  of that period. SIR PHILIP SIDNEY, who died of his wound at Arnhem,  October 15th, 1586, was buried in St. Paul's, with signs of public  grief almost unparalleled. \"It was accounted sin for months afterwards  for any gentleman to appear in London streets in gay apparel.\" The  tablet to him was of wood, and bore the following inscription:--      \"England, Netherlands, the Heavens and the Arts,    The Soldiers, and the World, have made six parts    Of noble Sidney; for none will suppose    That a small heap of stones can Sidney enclose.    His body hath England, for she it bred,    Netherlands his blood, in her defence shed,    The Heavens have his soul, the Arts have his fame,    All soldiers the grief, the World his good name.\"    Close to this, on the same pillar, was a tablet to SIR THOMAS  BASKERVILLE, who had also done good service as a brave soldier,  according to the account given in fourteen lines of verse, which, it  must be said, are a great deal more musical than Sidney's.    SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON (1540-1591) had a finer monument than any of  the other Elizabethan celebrities. Whether he deserved it is another  matter. He was clever and handsome, and got into special favour with  the Queen by his graceful dancing. He even wrote her amorous letters.  The part he took in procuring the condemnation of the Queen of Scots  is well known.    At the extreme end of St. Dunstan's Chapel we come to another Mediaeval  worthy.    HENRY DE LACY, EARL OF LINCOLN (1249-1311), \"the closest councillor of  Edward I.\" (Bishop Stubbs), was somewhat doubtful in his loyalty to  Edward II., being divided between his grateful memory of the father  and his disgust at the conduct of the son. His house was on the site  of Lincoln's Inn, which owes its name to him. He was a munificent  contributor to the \"new work\" of St. Paul's, and was buried in St.  Dunstan's Chapel, on the south side of the Lady Chapel.      [Footnote 1: \"Here lieth Sebba, King of the East Saxons, who was  converted to the faith by Erkenwald, Bishop of London, in the year of  Christ 677. A man much devoted to God, greatly occupied in religious  acts, frequent prayers, and pious fruits of almsgiving, preferring  a private and monastic life to all the riches and honours of the  kingdom, who, when he had reigned 30 years, received the religious  habit at the hands of Walther, Bishop of London, who succeeded the  aforesaid Erkenwald, of whom the Venerable Bede makes mention in his  History of the English People.\"]    [Footnote 2: \"Here lieth Ethelred, King of the English, son of  King Edgar, to whom, on the day of his hallowing, St. Dunstan, the  archbishop, after placing the crown upon him, is said to have foretold  terrible things in these words: Forasmuch as thou hast aspired to the  Kingdom through the death of thy brother, against whom the English  have conspired along with thy wretched mother, the sword shall not  depart from thy house, raging against thee all the days of thy life,  destroying thy seed until the day when thy Kingdom shall be conveyed  to another Kingdom whose customs and language the race over whom  thou rulest knoweth not; nor shall there be expiation save by  long-continued penalty of the sin of thyself, of thy mother, and of  those men who took part in that shameful deed. Which things came to  pass even as that holy man foretold; for Ethelred being worn out and  put to flight in many battles by Sweyn, King of the Danes, and his son  Cnut, and at last, closely besieged in London, died miserably in the  year of the Incarnation 1017, after a reign of 36 years of great  tribulation.\"]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IV.

Our next subject will be some history of the events which the  cathedral witnessed from time to time during its existence, and for  this we have to go back to the very beginning, to the first simple  building, whatever it was, in which the first bishop, Mellitus, began  his ministry. He founded the church in 604, and he had troubled times.  The sons of his patron, King Sebert, relapsed into paganism, indeed  they had never forsaken it, though so long as their father lived they  had abstained from heathen rites. One day, entering the church, they  saw the bishop celebrating the Sacrament, and said, \"Give us some of  that white bread which you gave our father.\" Mellitus replied that  they could not receive it before they were baptized; whereupon they  furiously exclaimed that he should not stay among them. In terror he  fled abroad, as did Justus from Rochester, and as Laurence would have  done from Canterbury, had he not received a Divine warning. Kent soon  returned to the faith which it had abandoned; but Essex for a while  remained heathen, and when Mellitus wished to return they refused him,  and he succeeded Laurence at Canterbury. Other bishops ministered to  the Christians as well as they could; but the authority of the See and  the services of the cathedral were restored by Erkenwald, one of the  noblest of English prelates, son of Offa, King of East Anglia. He  founded the two great monasteries of Chertsey and Barking, ruled the  first himself, and set his sister Ethelburga over the other. In 675 he  was taken from his abbey and consecrated fourth Bishop of London by  Archbishop Theodore, and held the See until 693. He was a man, by  universal consent, of saintly life and vast energy. He left his mark  by strengthening the city wall and building the gate, which is called  after him Bishopsgate. Close by is the church which bears the name of  his sister, St. Ethelburga. He converted King Sebba to the faith; but  it was probably because of his beneficent deeds to the Londoners  that he was second only to Becket in the popular estimate, all over  southern England. There were pilgrimages from the country around to  his shrine in the cathedral, special services on his day, and special  hymns. In fact, as in the case of St. Edward, there were two days  dedicated to him, that of his death, April 30, and that of his  translation, November 14, and these days were classed in London among  the high festivals. His costly shrine was at the back of the screen  behind the high altar. The inscription upon it, besides enumerating  the good deeds we have named, said that he added largely to the  noble buildings of the cathedral, greatly enriched its revenues, and  obtained for it many privileges from kings. His name, so far as its  etymology is concerned, found its repetition in _Archibald_, Bishop of  London, 1856-1868, the founder of the \"Bishop of London's Fund.\"    Another bishop of these early times was Theodred, who was named \"the  Good.\" We cannot give the exact dates of his episcopate, further than  that he was in the See in the middle of the tenth century, as is shown  by some charters that he witnessed. There is a pathetic story told of  him that on his way from London to join King Athelstan in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16534"],[0,"A Young Folks' History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (#6)"],[1,"elders went to Colesville to hold meetings and baptize some  believers. The brethren built a dam in a creek on Saturday where they were  to baptize on Sunday, but during the night a mob tore the dam away.  However, meeting was held on Sunday, and early on Monday morning the dam  was repaired and the baptisms were attended to; but before they were  through, the mob gathered and followed the Saints to their homes, making  all kinds of threats. That evening as they were going to hold a meeting, a  constable arrested Joseph Smith on the charge of making disorder, setting  the country in an uproar by preaching the Book of Mormon, etc.    The constable was a good man, and told Joseph that the mob was going to try  to take him and perhaps kill him; but he would protect Joseph. In driving  to another town where the court was to be held, the mob lay in waiting by  the road, but the constable whipped up his horse and they got away.    The next day when Joseph was called to be tried, there was a large crowd  and much excitement as many wished to see and hear the young prophet. The  trial commenced and many persons who knew Joseph were called to tell  something about him. Among the number was Mr. Stoal, for whom Joseph had  worked.    \"Did not the prisoner, Joseph Smith, have a horse of you?\" was asked of Mr.  Stoal.    \"Yes, sir,\" was the answer.    \"Did not he go to you and tell you that an angel had appeared unto him and  told him to get the horse from you?\"    \"No; he told me no such story.\"    \"Well, how had he the horse of you?\"    \"He bought him of me as another man would do?\"    \"Have you had your pay?\"    \"That is not your business.\"    The same question was asked again.    \"I hold his note for the price of the horse,\" replied Mr. Stoal, \"which I  consider as good as the pay, for I am well acquainted with Joseph Smith,  Jr., and know him to be an honest man, and if he wishes, I am ready to let  him have another horse on the same terms.\"    Many other witnesses were called, but the above is a fair sample of the  questions and the answers received. Nothing wrong was proved against Joseph  and he was discharged.    But no sooner was Joseph released than another constable appeared and  arrested him again. This officer mistreated Joseph shamefully. He would  give him nothing to eat, and he allowed a crowd of men to spit upon him and  otherwise abuse him.    The next day Joseph was tried again, this time at Colesville. His friends  again gathered around to protect him while his enemies tried harder than  ever to have him convicted of some crime. Many witnesses were called who  told untrue stories of Joseph, but when they were questioned they  contradicted each other so that everybody, including the court, could see  they were not telling the truth.    Newel Knight was called as a witness.    \"Did the prisoner, Joseph Smith, Jr., cast the devil out of you?\" asked the  lawyer who was against Joseph.    \"No, sir,\" was the reply.    \"Why, have you not had the devil cast out of you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And had not Joe Smith some hand in its being done\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And did he not cast him out of you?\"    \"No, sir; it was done by the power of God, and Joseph Smith was the  instrument in the hands of God to do it. He commanded him out of me in the  name of Jesus Christ.\"    The lawyer could make nothing out of him or the others who were called to  tell of some supposed wrong Joseph had done. Nothing could be found against  him that would send him to prison, and I suppose the judge thought that  even casting the devil out of a man was not such a great crime. So Joseph  was once more released and a free man.    But of course the mob was not satisfied, so they laid a plan to capture  Joseph and tar and feather him; but now the constable who had treated him  so badly, saw by the trial that he was innocent, and came to Joseph and  asked his forgiveness. He told the prophet of the mob's intentions and  helped Joseph to get safely away home.    So the Lord was with his servants and helped them out of the hands of those  who would harm them. The Lord was also kind to the Saints and gave the  Church many revelations which you may find in the book called \"Doctrine and  Covenants,\" which contains the revelations given to the Church through  Joseph the Prophet.    Topics.--1. Persecution of the Saints. 2. The arrests and trials of  Joseph. 3. The Doctrine and Covenants.    Questions and Review.--1. What did Jesus say about persecution? (See St.  Matthew 5:10, 12.) 2. Where is Colesville? 3. What was Joseph's errand in  Colesville? 4. What did the mob do? 5. For what was Joseph arrested? 6.  Tell about his first trial. 7. Who testified at the second trial? 8. After  his discharge what did the mob intend to do to Joseph? 9. Who helped him to  escape? 10. What is the Doctrine and Covenants?          CHAPTER X.    THE MISSION TO THE INDIANS.      In the month of September, 1830, a young man came to the house of Joseph  Smith, at Fayette, and asked to see the prophet. As Joseph was absent, he  was referred to his brother Hyrum who explained to him what he wanted to  know about the Book of Mormon, the revelations of the Lord to his brother,  and the establishing of the Church. The young man was a preacher of the  sect called Campbellites, and his name was Parley P. Pratt. On his journey  from his home in Ohio to New York he had obtained a copy of the Book of  Mormon, had read it, and had been deeply impressed with its beautiful  truths. Wishing to know more about this new revelation of God, he had  sought out Joseph.    Parley P. Pratt joined the Church and soon became one of its leading men,  working with Joseph and his brethren with great energy. He became one of  the Twelve Apostles, traveled in many parts of the earth preaching the  gospel, wrote many fine books, and at last was killed by a wicked man in  the state of Arkansas.    Some day you will want to read a full account of this great man's history  as he wrote it himself, but here I will give you but a few of these  interesting events, because they have much to do with the Church at this  point of our history.    You will remember that the Book of Mormon tells about the early history of  the Indians. In this book it is predicted that some day the gospel should  be preached to them, and the record of their forefathers should also be  brought to their knowledge. At the second conference of the Church held in  Fayette, September 1st, Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, Ziba Peterson and  Peter Whitmer, Jr., were called to go on a mission to the Indians. They  were to go into the wilderness through the western states and into the  Indian Territory, preaching by the way whenever a chance afforded.    It was late in October when these four elders started on this the first  important mission of the Church. They preached to some Indians near the  city of Buffalo, presented them with the Book of Mormon, and proceeded on  their journey into the state of Ohio. In the northeastern part of this  state is the town of Kirtland where Elder Pratt had some friends. They  stopped here for some time and preached the gospel to the people. Great  interest was aroused, many believed and were baptized. Among these was  Elder Pratt's former teacher, Sidney Rigdon, who also became one of the  Church's leading men. Others who joined the Church at this time were Edward  Partridge who became the first bishop in the Church, Newel K. Whitney who  became the second, Lyman Wight who became an apostle, and many others. In a  few weeks the missionaries had raised up a large branch of the Church at  Kirtland.    Having done this good work, the elders went on their way westward. One  evening they were stopping at the house of one Simeon Carter not far from  Brother Pratt's old home. They were just about to read to him from the Book  of Mormon when an officer entered and arrested Elder Pratt. The elders left  their book with Mr. Carter and went with the officer to a sort of court,  where Brother Pratt was ordered to pay a large sum of money or go to  prison. The prisoner paid no attention to these demands, which made his  persecutors very angry. It was now about midnight, but the elders took it  quietly and sang a hymn or two. Then Elder Pratt said that if the witnesses  who had told false things about them and the judge who had abused and  insulted them, would repent of their evil words and acts and would all  kneel down together he would pray that God might forgive them.    \"My big bull-dog pray for me!\" said the judge.    \"The devil help us!\" cried another.    Next morning as Elder Pratt and the man placed to guard him were walking in  the road, the elder asked the officer if he was good at a race.    \"No!\" was the reply, \"but my big dog is. I have trained him and he will  take any man down at my bidding.\"    \"Well,\" continued Bro. Pratt, \"you have given me a chance to preach and  have given me lodging and breakfast. I thank you for your kindness, but I  must be going. Good-day, sir.\"    With that Elder Pratt left the man and his dog, and had got quite a  distance before the officer had recovered from his surprise. Then he came  running after him, clapping his hands and shouting to his dog.    \"Stu--boy, stu--boy, take him Watch, lay hold of him! Down with him!\" At  the same time pointing in the direction of the fleeing elder. Just as the  fierce animal was about to overtake him, Elder Pratt began clapping his  hands and shouting like the officer, pointing into the woods just ahead.  The dog bounded past him and was soon lost to sight in the forest, while  the missionary got safely away.    Mr. Carter read the Book of Mormon the elders had left. He believed, went  fifty miles to Kirtland, was baptized, returned home, began to preach, and  soon there was a branch of sixty members in that place.    In western Ohio the missionaries found another tribe of Indians with whom  they stayed a few days. They then"]]]
