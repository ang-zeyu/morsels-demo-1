They may give dazzling performances of works  bristling with technical difficulties, yet make a sad failure of some  slow, tender movement that calls for musicianly understanding and  delicate treatment. The truth is, the requirements for an artistic  accompanist, or for artistic concerted work, are the same as for an  artistic soloist: well directed musical aptitude, love of art, an ear  attuned to listening and large experience in sight-reading.    The music pupils' public recital contributes no little to the blunders  of the day in music study. Especially with piano pupils, the work of the  year is likely to be shaped with reference to the supreme occasion when  results attained may be exhibited in the presence of assembled parents  and friends. The popular demand being for the mastery of technique,  showy pieces are prepared whose mechanism so claims the attention that  the principles underlying both technics and interpretation are  neglected. Well-controlled hands, fingers, wrists and arms, with  excellent manipulation of the keyboard, may be admired at the recital,  but little of that effective playing is heard which finds its way to the  hearer's heart. A dead monotony will too often recall the letter that  killeth because devoid of the spirit that giveth life.    Sounding notes, even sounding them smoothly, clearly, and rapidly, is  not necessarily making music, and a succession of them without warmth  and coloring is truly as inartistic as painting without shading. If it  were more commonly realized that it is an essential part of the music  teacher's vocation to train the mind and the emotions and through them  the will and the character, there would be a higher standard for the  music pupils' recital. No one would be permitted to play, or sing in  public who could not give an artistic, as well as a technically correct  performance.    Music students should lose no opportunity to hear the best music, both  vocal and instrumental. Heard with understanding ears one good concert  is often worth a dozen lessons, yet many students know nothing in music  beyond what they have practiced themselves, or heard their  fellow-students give at rehearsals or recitals. If they attend concerts  at all, it is rather to observe some schoolmaster method in their own  particular branch than actually to enjoy music. Trying to gain a musical  education without a wide acquaintance with the literature of music is  like attempting to form literary taste without knowing the world's great  books. To bathe in the glow of the mighty masterpieces of genius  neutralizes much that is evil. In music they are the only authoritative  illustrations between notes and the ideals they represent; they form the  models and maxims by means of which we approach a knowledge of music.    In view of hearing good music, breathing a musical atmosphere and being  glorified into artists, vast numbers of American girls seek foreign  musical centres. They are apt to go without suitable equipment, mental  or musical, and with inadequate pecuniary provisions. They expect to  attain in a few months what they are doomed to discover would take years  to accomplish, and cannot fail to suffer for the blunder. Many of them  return home disappointed in their aims, and ruined in health. Many of  them are stranded in strange lands. A crusade should be started against  indiscriminate going abroad for music study, without thorough  preparation in every respect.    The fact is, a free, true, fearless hero, such as Wagner found in his  Siegfried, is needed to slay, with his invincible sword, the dragon of  sordid materialism, and awaken the slumbering bride of genuine art. A  storm-god is wanted to swing his hammer and finally dissipate the  clouds that obscure the popular vision. Some one has called for a plumed  knight at the literary tournament, with visor down, lance in hand,  booted and spurred for the fight with prevalent errors. One is equally  needed at the musical tournament.          III    The Musical Education That Educates      There is a musical education that educates, a musical education that  refines, strengthens, broadens the character and the views, that ripens  every God-given instinct and force. It arouses noble thoughts and lofty  ideals; it quickens the perceptions, opening up a world of beauty that  is closed to the unobservant; it bears its fortunate possessor into a  charmed atmosphere, where inspiring, elevating influences prevail. Its  aim is nothing short of the absolutely symmetrical development of the  spiritual, intellectual and physical being, in view of making the  well-rounded musician, the well-balanced individual.    The profits derived from a musical education are proportionate to the  investment. Careless work, an utter disregard of principles, in other  words, a mere dabbling with music, will afford but superficial results.  It is precisely the same with a haphazard pursuit of any branch of art,  science, or literature. Through music the soul of mankind may be  elevated, the secret recesses of thought and feeling stirred, and every  emotion of which the individual is capable made active. In order to  attain its full benefits it is imperative to use it as a profound living  force, not as a mere surface decoration.    \"The musician ever shrouded in himself must cultivate his inmost being  that he may turn it outward,\" said Goethe. A true musical education  provides culture for the inmost being. It tends to enlarge the  sympathies, enrich social relations and invest daily life with gracious  dignity. Those who gain it beautify their own lives and thus become able  to make the world seem more beautiful to others. Those who are never  able to give utterance to the wealth of thought and feeling it has  aroused in their hearts and imaginations are still happy in possessing  the store. After all, our main business in art, as in life, is to  strive. Honest effort meets with its own reward, even where it does not  lead to what the world calls success.    It has been said that he who sows thoughts will reap deeds, habits,  character. The force of these words is exemplified in the proper study  of music, which results in a rich harvest of self-restraint,  self-reliance, industry, patience, perseverance, powers of observation,  retentive memory, painstaking effort, strength of mind and character. To  possess these qualities at their best abundant thought must be sown.  Merely to ring changes on the emotions will not elevate to the heights.  The musical education that educates makes of the reasoning powers a  lever that keeps the emotions in their rightful channel.    Aristotle, who dominated the world's thought for upwards of two thousand  years, attributed his acquirements to the command he had gained over  his mind. Fixedness of purpose, steady, undivided attention, mental  concentration, accuracy, alertness, keen perception and wise  discrimination are essential to achievement. This is true of giant  minds; it is equally true of average intellects. The right musical  education will conduce to these habits. Musical education without them  must inevitably be a failure.    Music study is many-sided. To make it truly educative it must be pursued  from both theoretical and practical standpoints. It should include  technical training which affords facility to express whatever a person  may have for expression; intellectual training which enables a person to  grasp the constructive laws of the art, its scope, history and  aesthetics, with all that calls into play the analytic and imaginative  faculties; and spiritual development which imparts warmth and glow to  everything. Even those who do not advance far in music study would do  well, as they proceed, to touch the art on as many sides as possible, in  view of enlarging the musical sense, sharpening the musical perception,  concentrating and multiplying the agencies by virtue of which musical  knowledge and proficiency are attained.    \"Truth,\" said Madox-Brown, the Pre-Raphaelite, \"is the means of art, its  end the quickening of the soul.\" Music does more than quicken the soul;  it reveals the soul, makes it conscious of itself. Springing from the  deepest and best that is implanted in man, it fertilizes the soil from  which it uprises. Both beauty and truth are essential to its welfare. As  Hamilton W. Mabie has said: \"We need beauty just as truly as we need  truth, for it is as much a part of our lives. We have learned in part  the lesson of morality, but we have yet to learn the lesson of beauty.\"  This must be learned through the culture of the aesthetic taste, a matter  of slow growth, which should begin with the rudiments, and is best  fostered in an atmosphere saturated with good music.    Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of hearing good music.  When it falls on listening ears it removes all desire for anything  coarse or unrefined. Constant companionship with it prepares the ear to  hear, the inner being to receive, and cannot fail to bring forth fruit.  The creations of noble minds form practical working-forces in shaping  character, purifying taste and elevating standards. A literary scholar  cannot be made of one who has not been brought into close touch with the  productions of the great masters in literature, nor an artistic painter,  or sculptor, of one who has never known a great painting or piece of  statuary. Neither can a thorough musician be made of any one who is  ignorant of the master-works of music. It is well to realize, with  Goethe, that the effect of good music is not caused by its novelty, but  strikes more deeply the more we are familiar with it.    The human voice being practically the foundation of music and the first  music teacher, every well-educated musician should be able to use it,  and should have a clear understanding of its possibilities and  limitations, no matter what his specialty may be."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#6)"],[1,"nga, each carrying a baby in the lap. Ganga  tells her of the birth of the twins and consoles her, but Earth is  greatly distressed with the conduct of Rama. Ganga replies \"who can  close the door of Fate?\"    But Earth says, \"has it been proper for the good Rama? He disregarded  the hand he pressed when a boy. He disregarded me and Janaka. He  disregarded Fire (who shewed her purity). He disregarded the children  she was about to bring forth.\"    But Ganga pacifies her and they agree to make over the children to  Valmiki, when they become a little old. Earth then asks her daughter to  come to the nether world, to which she agrees and with their exit closes  the play.    At the close of the play, Rama faints. Then the real Sita enters with  Arundhuti, the wife of Rama's preceptor and touches and revives her  husband. The people are satisfied with her purity and Rama takes her  back with the children who are introduced by Valmiki. The husband and  wife are thus re-united after twelve years of grievous solitude, and  happiness is restored to the whole family. The re-union is witnessed not  only by the people of Ayodhya, but by the congregated deities of earth  and heaven.    Rama thus describes his love for his wife:--    \"Her presence is ambrosia to my sight; her contact, fragrant sandal; her  fond arms, twined round my neck; are a far richer clasp than costliest  gems, and in my house she reigns the guardian goddess of my fame and  fortune. Oh! I could never bear again to lose her.\"          MALATI AND MADHAVA OR THE STOLEN MARRIAGE.      There lived, in the town of Kundinapura in Berar, Devarata, a very calm  and sagacious minister to the king of Vidarbha. He had a son named  Madhava. Madhava was very beautiful and of uncommon intelligence. He  became proficient in all branches of learning, in his early age. He now  arrived at a marriageable age. The beautiful town of Padmavati in Malwa  is situated at the confluence of the two rivers Indus and Madhumati.  There lived in Padmavati, Bhurivasu, who was minister to the king of  Padmavati. He had a very beautiful unmarried daughter named Malati. The  king indicated an intention to propose a match between Malati and his  own favourite Nandan, who was both old and ugly, and whom she detested.  Bhurivasu feared to give offence to the king by refusing the match.  Devarata and Bhurivasu were fellow students. In their academical days  they pledged themselves that they should enter into matrimonial  alliance, if they happen to have children. Malati and Madhava did not  know anything about their fathers' promises. There lived in Padmavati,  Kamandaki, an old Buddhist priestess who was nurse of Malati. The  priestess knew everything about the matrimonial promise. She was a very  intelligent lady and was respected by all. The two friends concert a  plan with the priestess to throw the young people in each other's way  and to connive at a secret marriage. In pursuance of this scheme,  Madhava is sent to finish his studies at the city of Padmavati with the  ostensible object of studying Logic under the care of the priestess, who  takes great care of her pupil and endeavours her utmost to fulfil the  promise of her two friends. By her contrivance and with the aid of  Malati's foster-sister Lavangika, the young people meet and become  mutually enamoured.    Kamandaki addresses her favourite disciple Avalokita thus:--    \"Dear Avalokita! Oh how I wish for the marital union of Madhava, the son  of Devarata, and Malati, the daughter of Bhurivasu! Auspicious signs  forerun a happy fate. Even now my throbbing eyeball tells that  propitious destiny shall crown my schemes.\"    Avalokita replies:--    \"Oh, here is a serious cause of anxiety. How strange! You are already  burdened with the austerities of devotional exercises, Bhurivasu has  commissioned you to perform this arduous task. Though retired from the  world, you could not avoid this business.\"    Kamandaki says, \"Never say so. The commission is an office of love and  trust. If my friend's object is gained even at the expense of my life  and penances, I shall feel myself gratified.\"    The pupil asks \"why is a stolen marriage intended?\"    The priestess answers, \"Nandana, a favourite of the king of Padmavati,  sues him for Malati. The king demands the maiden of her father. To evade  the anger of the king, this ingenious device has been adopted. Let the  world deem their union was the work of mutual passion only. So the king  and Nandan will be foiled. A wise man veils his projects from the  world.\" The pupil says, \"I take Madhava to walk in the street in front  of the house of the minister Bhurivasu.\"    The priestess says,    \"I have heard from Lavangika, the foster-sister of Malati, that Malati  has seen Madhava from the windows of her house.    Her waning form faithfully betrays the lurking care she now first learns  to suffer.\"    The pupil says, \"I have heard that, to soothe that care, Malati has  drawn a picture of Madhava and has sent it through Lavangika to  Mandarika, her attendant.\"    The priestess perceives that Malati has done so with the object that the  picture would reach Madhava as Mandarika is in love with Kalahansa, the  servant of Madhava. Avalokita again says,    \"To-day is the great festival of Madan; Malati will surely come to join  the festival, I have interested Madhava to go to the garden of Love's  god with a view that the youthful pair may meet there.\"    The priestess replies, \"I tender my best thanks for your kindly zeal to  aid the object of my wishes. Can you give me any tidings of Soudamini,  my former pupil?\"    Avalokita answers, \"she now resides upon mount _Sriparvata_. She has now  arrived at supernatural power by religious austerities. I have learnt  the news about her from Kapala Kundala, the female pupil of a tremendous  magician Aghorghanta, a seer and a wandering mendicant, but now residing  amidst the neighbouring forest, who frequents the temple of the  dreadful goddess _Chamunda_ near the city cemetry.\" Avalokita remarks,  \"Madhava would be highly pleased if his early friend Makaranda is united  in wedlock with Madayantika, the sister of Nandana.\"    The priestess observes, \"I have already engaged my disciple  Buddharakshita for the purpose. Let us go forth and having learnt how  Madhava has fared, repair to Malati. May our devices prosper!\"    Madhava thus describes to his friend Makaranda his first interview with  Malati, and acknowledges himself deeply smitten:--    \"One day, advised by Avalokita, I went to the temple of the god of love.  I saw there a beauteous maid. I have become a victim to her glances. Her  gait was stately. Her train bespoke a princely rank. Her garb was graced  with youth's appropriate ornaments. Her form was beauty's shrine, or of  that shrine she moved as the guardian deity. Whatever Nature offers  fairest and best had surely been assembled to mould her charms. Love  omnipotent was her creator. Then I too plainly noted that the lovely  maid, revealed the signs of passion long entertained for some happy  youth.    Her shape was as slender as the lotus stalk. Her pallid cheeks, like  unstained ivory, rivalled the beauty of the spotless moon. I scarcely  had gazed upon her, but my eyes felt new delight, as bathed with nectar.  She drew my heart at once towards her as powerfully as the magnet does  the unresisting iron. That heart, though its sudden passion may be  causeless, is fixed on her for ever, chance what may, and though my  portion be henceforth despair. The goddess Destiny decrees at pleasure  the good or ill of all created beings.\"    Makranda observes, \"Believe me, this cannot be without some cause.  Behold! all nature's sympathies spring not from outward form but from  inward virtue. The lotus does not bud till the sun has risen. The  moon-gem does not melt till it feels the moon.\" Madhava goes on with his  description thus:--    \"When her fair train beheld me, they exchanged expressive looks and  smiles and murmured to one another as if they knew me. What firmness  could resist the honest warmth of nature's mute expressiveness? Those  looks of love, beaming with mild timidity and moist with sweet  abandonment, tore off my heart,--nay plucked it from my bosom by the  roots, all pierced with wounds. Being incredulous of my happiness, I  sought to mark her passion, without displaying my own. A stately  elephant received the princess and bore her towards the city. Whilst she  moved, she shot from her delicate lids retiring glances, tipped with  venom and ambrosia, My breast received the shafts. Words cannot paint my  agony. Vain were the lunar rays or gelid streams to cool my body's  fever, whilst my mind whirls in perpetual round and does not know rest.  Requested by Lavangika, I gave her the flowery wreath. She took it with  respect, as if it were a precious gift and all the while the eyes of  Malati were fixed on her. Bowing with reverence, she than retired.\"    Makaranda remarks--    \"Your story most plainly shows that Malati's affection is your own. The  soft cheek, whose pallid tint denoted love pre-conceived, is pale alone  for you; She must have seen you. Maidens of her rank do not allow their  eyes to rest on one to whom they have not already given their hearts.  And then, those looks that passed among her maidens plainly showed the  passion you had awakened in their mistress.    Then comes her foster-sister's clear enigma and tells intelligibly whose  her heart is.\"    Kalahansa, advancing, shows a picture and says, \"This picture is the  work of hers who has stolen Madhava's heart. Mandarika gave it to me.  She had it from Lavangika, Malati painted it to amuse and relieve  distress.\" Makaranda says, \"This lovely maid, the soft light of your  eyes, assuredly regards you bound to her in love's alliance. What should  prevent your union? Fate and love combined seem labouring to effect it.  Come, let me behold the wondrous form that works"]]]
