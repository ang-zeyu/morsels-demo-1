One flew over the deck  between the masts, and plunged harmlessly in the sea beyond. The other  struck the hull with a dull crash.    \"It is lucky the ladies were sent into the hold,\" the captain said.  \"That shot has gone right through their cabin.    \"Now, my lads, have you got the sights well upon them? Fire!\"    The four thirty-two pounders spoke out almost at the same moment, and  all gazed over the bulwarks anxiously to watch the effect, and a cheer  arose as it was seen how accurate had been the aim of the gunners. One  shot struck the schooner to windward in the bow, a foot or two above  the water level. Another went through her foresail, close to the mast.    \"A foot more, and you would have cut his foremast asunder.\"    The vessel to leeward had been struck by only one shot, the other  passing under her stern. She was struck just above her deck line, the  shot passing through the bulwark, and, as they thought on board the  merchantman, narrowly missing if not actually striking the mainmast.    \"There is some damage done,\" Dr. Rae said, keeping his glass fixed on  the vessel. \"There is a good deal of running about on deck there.\"    It was evident that the display of the heavy metal carried by the  Indiaman was an unpleasant surprise to the privateers. Both lowered  sail and ceased firing, and there was then a rapid exchange of signals  between them.    \"They don't like it,\" the captain said, laughing. \"They see that they  cannot play the game they expected, and that they've got to take as  well as to give. Now it depends upon the sort of stuff their captains  are made of, whether they give it up at once, or come straight up to  close quarters.    \"Ah! They mean fighting.\"    As he spoke, a cloud of canvas was spread upon the schooners and,  sailing more than two feet to the merchantman's one, they ran quickly  down towards her, firing rapidly as they came. Only the merchantman's  heavy guns replied, but these worked steadily and coolly, and did  considerable damage. The bowsprit of one of their opponents was shot  away. The sails of both vessels were pierced in several places, and  several ragged holes were knocked in their hulls.    \"If it were not that I do not wish to sacrifice any of the lives on  board, unnecessarily,\" the captain said, \"I would let them come  alongside and try boarding. We have a strong crew, and with the sixty  soldiers we should give them such a reception as they do not dream of.  However, I will keep them off, if I can.    \"Now, Mr. James,\" he said to the first officer, \"I propose to give  that vessel to leeward a dose. They are keeping about abreast, and by  the course they are making will range alongside at about a cable's  length. When I give the word, pour a broadside with the guns to port  upon that weather schooner.    \"At that moment, gentlemen,\" he said, turning to the passengers, \"I  shall rely upon you to pick off the steersman of the other vessel, and  to prevent another taking his place. She steers badly now, and the  moment her helm is free, she'll run up into the wind. As she does so,  I shall bear off, run across her bow, and rake her deck with grape as  we pass.    \"Will you, Mr. Barlow, order your men to be in readiness to open fire  with musketry upon her, as we pass?\"    The schooners were now running rapidly down upon the Indiaman. They  were only able to use the guns in their bows, and the fire of the  Indiaman from the heavy guns on her quarter was inflicting more damage  than she received.    \"Let all hands lie down on deck,\" the captain ordered. \"They will open  with their broadside guns, as they come up. When I give the word, let  all the guns on the port side be trained at the foot of her mainmast,  and fire as you get the line. On the starboard side, lie down till I  give the word.\"    It was a pretty sight as the schooners, throwing the water high up  from their sharp cut-waters, came running along, heeling over under  the breeze. As they ranged alongside, their topsails came down, and a  broadside from both was poured into the Indiaman. The great ship shook  as the shot crashed into her, and several sharp cries told of the  effect which had been produced.    Then the captain gave the word, and a moment afterwards an irregular  broadside, as the captain of each gun brought his piece to bear, was  poured into the schooner from the guns on the port side. As the  privateer heeled over, her deck could be plainly seen, and the shot of  the Indiaman, all directed at one point, tore up a hole around the  foot of the mainmast. In an instant the spar tottered and, with a  crash, fell alongside. At the same moment, three of the passengers  took a steady aim over the bulwark at the helmsman of the other  privateer and, simultaneously with the reports of their pieces, the  man was seen to fall. Another sprang forward to take his place, but  again the rifles spoke out, and he fell beside his comrade.    Freed from the strain which had counteracted the pressure of her  mainsail, the schooner flew up into the wind. The Indiaman held on her  course for another length, and then her helm was put up, and she swept  down across the bows of the privateer. Then the men leaped to their  feet, the soldiers lined the bulwarks, and as she passed along a few  yards only distant from her foe, each gun poured a storm of grape  along her crowded deck, while the troops and passengers kept up a  continuous fire of musketry.    \"That will do,\" the captain said, quietly. \"Now we may keep her on her  course. They have had more than enough of it.\"    There was no doubt of that, for the effect of the iron storm had been  terrible, and the decks of the schooner were strewn with dead and  dying. For a time after the merchantman had borne upon her course, the  sails of the schooner flapped wildly in the wind, and then the  foremast went suddenly over the side.    \"I should think you could take them both, Captain Thompson,\" one of  the passengers said.    \"They are as good as taken,\" the captain answered, \"and would be  forced to haul down their flags, if I were to wear round and continue  the fight. But they would be worse than useless to me. I should not  know what to do with their crews, and should have to cripple myself by  putting very strong prize crews upon them, and so run the risk of  losing my own ship and cargo.    \"No, my business is to trade and not to fight. If any one meddle with  me, I am ready to take my own part; but the Company would not thank  me, if I were to risk the safety of this ship and her valuable cargo  for the sake of sending home a couple of prizes, which might be  recaptured as they crossed the bay, and would not fetch any great sum  if they got safely in port.\"    An examination showed that the casualties on board the Lizzie Anderson  amounted to three killed and eight wounded. The former were sewn in  hammocks, with a round shot at their feet, and dropped overboard; the  clergyman reading the burial service. The wounded were carried below,  and attended to by the ship's surgeon and Doctor Rae. The ship's decks  were washed, and all traces of the conflict removed. The guns were  again lashed in their places, carpenters were lowered over the side to  repair damages; and when the ladies came on deck an hour after the  conflict was over, two or three ragged holes in the bulwarks, and a  half dozen in the sails, were the sole signs that the ship had been in  action; save that some miles astern could be seen the two crippled  privateers, with all sails lowered, at work to repair damages.    Two or three days afterwards, Charlie Marryat and his friend Peters  were sitting beside Doctor Rae, when the latter said:    \"I hope that we sha'n't find the French in Madras, when we get there.\"    \"The French in Madras!\" Charlie exclaimed in surprise. \"Why, sir,  there's no chance of that, is there?\"    \"A very great chance,\" the doctor said. \"Don't you know that they  captured the place three years ago?\"    \"No, sir; I'm ashamed to say that I know nothing at all about India,  except that the Company have trading stations at Bombay, Madras, and  Calcutta.\"    \"I will tell you about it,\" the doctor said. \"It is as well that you  should understand the position of affairs, at the place to which you  are going. You must know that the Company hold the town of Madras, and  a few square miles of land around it, as tenants of the Nawab of the  Carnatic, which is the name of that part of India. The French have a  station at Pondicherry, eighty-six miles to the sou'west of Madras.  This is a larger and more important town than Madras, and of course  the greatest rivalry prevails between the English and French.    \"The French are much more powerful than the English, and exercise a  predominating influence throughout the Carnatic. The French governor,  Monsieur Dupleix, is a man of very great ability, and far-seeing  views. He has a considerable force of French soldiers at his command,  and by the aid which he has given to the nawab, upon various  occasions, he has obtained a predominating influence in his councils.    \"When war was declared between England and France, in the year '44,  the English squadron under Commodore Barnet was upon the coast, and  the Company sent out orders to Mr. Morse, the governor of Madras, to  use every effort to destroy the French settlement, of whose rising  power they felt the greatest jealousy. Dupleix, seeing the force that  could be brought against him, and having no French ships on the  station, although he was aware that a fleet under Admiral La  Bourdonnais was fitting out and would arrive shortly, dreaded the  contest, and proposed to Mr. Morse that the Indian colonies of the two  nations should remain neutral, and take no part in the struggle in  which their respective countries were engaged. Mr. Morse, however, in  view of the orders he had received from the Company, was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#6)"],[1,"ntercessit, quin aliquem de consiliis ac motu Gallorum nuntium  acciperet. In his ab Lucio Roscio, quem legioni tertiae decimae  praefecerat, certior factus est magnas Gallorum copias earum civitatum,  quae Armoricae appellantur, oppugnandi sui causa convenisse neque  longius milia passuum octo ab hibernis suis afuisse, sed nuntio allato  de victoria Caesaris discessisse, adeo ut fugae similis discessus  videretur.      54    At Caesar principibus cuiusque civitatis ad se evocatis alias  territando, cum se scire quae fierent denuntiaret, alias cohortando  magnam partem Galliae in offiicio tenuit. Tamen Senones, quae est  civitas in primis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis, Cavarinum,  quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat, cuius frater Moritasgus adventu  in Galliam Caesaris cuiusque maiores regnum obtinuerant, interficere  publico consilio conati, cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset, usque ad  fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt et, missis ad Caesarem  satisfaciendi causa legatis, cum is omnem ad se senatum venire  iussisset, dicto audientes non fuerunt. Tantum apud homines barbaros  valuit esse aliquos repertos principes inferendi belli tantamque omnibus  voluntatum commutationem attulit, ut praeter Aeduos et Remos, quos  praecipuo semper honore Caesar habuit, alteros pro vetere ac perpetua  erga populum Romanum fide, alteros pro recentibus Gallici belli  officiis, nulla fere civitas fuerit non suspecta nobis. Idque adeo haud  scio mirandumne sit, cum compluribus aliis de causis, tum maxime quod  ei, qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur, tantum se eius  opinionis deperdidisse ut a populo Romano imperia perferrent gravissime  dolebant.      55    Treveri vero atque Indutiomarus totius hiemis nullum tempus  intermiserunt, quin trans Rhenum legatos mitterent, civitates  sollicitarent, pecunias pollicerentur, magna parte exercitus nostri  interfecta multo minorem superesse dicerent partem. Neque tamen ulli  civitati Germanorum persuaderi potuit, ut Rhenum transiret, cum se bis  expertos dicerent, Ariovisti bello et Tencterorum transitu: non esse  amplius fortunam temptaturos. Hac spe lapsus Indutiomarus nihilo minus  copias cogere, exercere, a finitimis equos parare, exules damnatosque  tota Gallia magnis praemiis ad se allicere coepit. Ac tantam sibi iam  his rebus in Gallia auctoritatem comparaverat ut undique ad eum  legationes concurrerent, gratiam atque amicitiam publice privatimque  peterent.      56    Vbi intellexit ultro ad se veniri, altera ex parte Senones Carnutesque  conscientia facinoris instigari, altera Nervios Aduatucosque bellum  Romanis parare, neque sibi voluntariorum copias defore, si ex finibus  suis progredi coepisset, armatum concilium indicit. Hoc more Gallorum  est initium belli, quo lege communi omnes puberes armati convenire  consuerunt; qui ex eis novissimus convenit, in conspectu multitudinis  omnibus cruciatibus affectus necatur. In eo concilio Cingetorigem,  alterius principem factionis, generum suum, quem supra demonstravimus  Caesaris secutum fidem ab eo non discessisse, hostem iudicat bonaque  eius publicat. His rebus confectis, in concilio pronuntiat arcessitum se  a Senonibus et Carnutibus aliisque compluribus Galliae civitatibus; huc  iturum per fines Remorum eorumque agros popula turum ac, priusquam id  faciat, castra Labieni oppugnaturum. Quae fieri velit praecipit.      57    Labienus, cum et loci natura et manu munitissumis castris sese teneret,  de suo ac legionis periculo nihil timebat; ne quam occasionem rei bene  gerendae dimitteret, cogitabat. Itaque a Cingetorige atque eius  propinquis oratione Indutiomari cognita, quam in concilio habuerat,  nuntios mittit ad finitimas civitates equitesque undique evocat: his  certum diem conveniendi dicit. Interim prope cotidie cum omni equitatu  Indutiomarus sub castris eius vagabatur, alias ut situm castrorum  cognosceret, alias colloquendi aut territandi causa: equites plerumque  omnes tela intra vallum coniciebant. Labienus suos intra munitionem  continebat timorisque opinionem, quibuscumque poterat rebus, augebat.      58    Cum maiore in dies contemptione Indutiomarus ad castra accederet, nocte  una intromissis equitibus omnium finitimarum civitatum quos arcessendos  curaverat, tanta diligentia omnes suos custodiis intra castra continuit,  ut nulla ratione ea res enuntiari aut ad Treveros perferri posset.  Interim ex consuetudine cotidiana Indutiomarus ad castra accedit atque  ibi magnam partem diei consumit; equites tela coniciunt et magna cum  contumelia verborum nostros ad pugnam evocant. Nullo ab nostris dato  responso, ubi visum est, sub vesperum dispersi ac dissipati discedunt.  Subito Labienus duabus portis omnem equitatum emittit; praecipit atque  interdicit, proterritis hostibus atque in fugam coniectis (quod fore,  sicut accidit, videbat) unum omnes peterent Indutiomarum, neu quis quem  prius vulneret, quam illum interfectum viderit, quod mora reliquorum  spatium nactum illum effugere nolebat; magna proponit eis qui occiderint  praemia; summittit cohortes equitibus subsidio. Comprobat hominis  consilium fortuna, et cum unum omnes peterent, in ipso fluminis vado  deprehensus Indutiomarus interficitur, caputque eius refertur in castra:  redeuntes equites quos possunt consectantur atque occidunt. Hac re  cognita omnes Eburonum et Nerviorum quae convenerant copiae discedunt,  pauloque habuit post id factum Caesar quietiorem Galliam.      Liber VI    Gaius Iulius Caesar    post 52    1    Multis de causis Caesar maiorem Galliae motum exspectans per Marcum  Silanum, Gaium Antistium Reginum, Titum Sextium legatos delectum habere  instituit; simul ab Gnaeo Pompeio proconsule petit, quoniam ipse ad  urbem cum imperio rei publicae causa remaneret, quos ex Cisalpina Gallia  consulis sacramento rogavisset, ad signa convenire et ad se proficisci  iuberet, magni interesse etiam in reliquum tempus ad opinionem Galliae  existimans tantas videri Italiae facultates ut, si quid esset in bello  detrimenti acceptum, non modo id brevi tempore sarciri, sed etiam  maioribus augeri copiis posset. Quod cum Pompeius et rei publicae et  amicitiae tribuisset, celeriter confecto per suos dilectu tribus ante  exactam hiemem et constitutis et adductis legionibus duplicatoque earum  cohortium numero, quas cum Quinto Titurio amiserat, et celeritate et  copiis docuit, quid populi Romani disciplina ataue ones Dossent.      2    Interfecto Indutiomaro, ut docuimus, ad eius propinquos a Treveris  imperium defertur. Illi finitimos Germanos sollicitare et pecuniam  polliceri non desistunt. Cum ab proximis impetrare non possent,  ulteriores temptant. Inventis nonnullis civitatibus iureiurando inter se  confirmant obsidibusque de pecunia cavent: Ambiorigem sibi societate et  foedere adiungunt. Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar, cum undique bellum  parari videret, Nervios, Aduatucos ac Menapios adiunctis Cisrhenanis  omnibus Germanis esse in armis, Senones ad imperatum non venire et cum  Carnutibus finitimisque civitatibus consilia communicare, a Treveris  Germanos crebris legationibus sollicitari, maturius sibi de bello  cogitandum putavit.      3    Itaque nondum hieme confecta proximis quattuor coactis legionibus de  improviso in fines Nerviorum contendit et, priusquam illi aut convenire  aut profugere possent, magno pecoris atque hominum numero capto atque ea  praeda militibus concessa vastatisque agris in deditionem venire atque  obsides sibi dare coegit. Eo celeriter confecto negotio rursus in  hiberna legiones reduxit. Concilio Galliae primo vere, ut instituerat,  indicto, cum reliqui praeter Senones, Carnutes Treverosque venissent,  initium belli ac defectionis hoc esse arbitratus, ut omnia postponere  videretur, concilium Lutetiam Parisiorum transfert. Confines erant hi  Senonibus civitatemque patrum memoria coniunxerant, sed ab hoc consilio  afuisse esistimabantur. Hac re pro suggestu pronuntiata eodem die cum  legionibus in Senones proficiscitur magnisque itineribus eo pervenit.      4    Cognito eius adventu Acco, qui princeps eius consili fuerat, iubet in  oppida multitudinem convenire. Conantibus, priusquam id effici posset,  adesse Romanos nuntiatur. Necessario sententia desistunt legatosque  deprecandi causa ad Caesarem mittunt: adeunt per Aeduos, quorum  antiquitus erat in fide civitas. Libenter Caesar petentibus Aeduis dat  veniam excusationemque accipit, quod aestivum tempus instantis belli,  non quaestionis esse arbitrabatur. Obsidibus imperatis centum hos Aeduis  custodiendos tradit. Eodem Carnutes legatos obsidesque mittunt usi  deprecatoribus Renis, quorum erant in clientela: eadem ferunt responsa.  Peragit concilium Caesar equitesque imperat civitatibus.      5    Hac parte Galliae pacata totus et mente et animo in bellum Treverorum et  Ambiorigis insistit. Cavari num cum equitatu Senonum secum proficisci  iubet, ne quis aut ex huius iracundia aut ex eo, quod meruerat, odio  civitatis motus exsistat. His rebus constitutis, quod pro explorato  habebat Ambiorigem proelio non esse concertaturum, reliqua eius consilia  animo circumspiciebat. Erant Menapii propinqui Eburonum finibus,  perpetuis paludibus silvisque muniti, qui uni ex Gallia de pace ad  Caesarem legatos numquam miserant. Cum his esse hospitium Ambiorigi  sciebat; item per Treveros venisse Germanis in amicitiam cognoverat.  Haec prius illi detrahenda auxilia existimabat quam ipsum bello  lacesseret, ne desperata salute aut se in Menapios abderet aut cum  Transrhenanis congredi cogeretur. Hoc inito consilio totius exercitus  impedimenta ad Labienum in Treveros mittit duasque legiones ad eum  proficisci iubet; ipse cum legionibus expeditis quinque in Menapios  proficiscitur. Illi nulla coacta manu loci praesidio freti in silvas  paludesque confugiunt suaque eodem conferunt.      6    Caesar partitis copiis cum Gaio Fabio legato et Marco Crasso quaestore  celeriterque effectis pontibus adit tripertito, aedificia vicosque  incendit, magno pecoris atque "]]]
