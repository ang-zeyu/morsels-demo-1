I frequently asked those of Rotuma what object  they had in leaving their fertile island to risk the perils of the deep?  the reply invariably was, \"Rotuma man want to see new land:\" they thus  run before the wind until they fall in with some island, or perish in  a storm. Cook and others relate numerous instances of this kind.    As an evidence of the great desire of the natives of both sexes to  leave their native land, I may mention the offers which were made to the  commander of the ship, of baskets of potatoes and hogs, as an inducement  to be carried to the island of Erromanga, where our vessel was next  bound to. Two hundred were taken on board for the purpose of cutting  Sandal wood, but from the unhealthy state in which we found the island  on our arrival, and the numerous deaths that had occurred among native  gangs that had been brought by other vessels for a similar purpose, we  returned to Rotuma and landed them all safely. The perfect apathy with  which they leave parents and connexions, departing with strangers to a  place respecting which they are in total ignorance, is quite surprising,  placing an unbounded confidence in those differing in colour, language,  and customs from themselves: the young, timid females, to whom a ship  was a novelty, those who had never before seen a ship, were all anxious  to visit foreign climes,--even, they said, London.    Much wonder was excited, when I exhibited to the natives of this island  coloured engravings of flowers, birds, butterflies, &c.; they imagined  them to be the original plant or butterfly attached to the paper--no  mean compliment to the artist. The engravings in Charles Bell's  Anatomy of Expression always excited much interest when shown to the  Polynesians; the plate representing Laughter never failed of exciting  sympathy. A caricature representation of one of the fashionable belles  of 1828 puzzled them exceedingly; some thought it \"a bird,\" others that  it was a nondescript of some kind, but when they were told that it was a  Haina London, or English lady, they laughed, and said Parora, \"you are  in joke,\" so incredible did it seem to their unsophisticated minds.[11]        [10] From a drawing, obligingly furnished by Mr. George Bennett,           Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, &c.

A short time since there were given in the _St. Petersburgh Academical  Journal_ some authentic particulars of Professor Parrot's journey to  Mount Ararat. After being baffled in repeated attempts, he at length  succeeded in overcoming the obstacles which beset him, and ascertained  the positive elevation of its peak to be 16,200 French feet: it is,  therefore, more than 1,500 feet loftier than Mount Blanc. He describes  the summit as being a circular plane, about 160 feet in circumference,  joined by a gentle descent, with a second and less elevated one towards  the east. The whole of the upper region of the mountain, from the height  of 12,750 English feet, being covered with perpetual snow and ice. He  afterwards ascended what is termed \"The Little Ararat,\" and reports it  to be about 13,100 English feet high.--W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *      SAILING UP THE ESSEQUIBO.    (_Concluded from page 360._)      A family of Indians was seen crossing the river in their log canoe, and  disappearing under the bushes on the opposite side; my companion and  myself paddled after them, and we landed under some locust trees, and  found an Indian settlement. The logies were sheds, open all round, and  covered with the leaves of the trooly-palm, some of them twenty-four  feet long; and suspended from the bamboo timbers of the roof were  hammocks of net-work, in which the men were lazily swinging. One or two  of those who were awake were fashioning arrow-heads out of hard wood.  The men and children were entirely naked, with the exception of the blue  _lap_ or cloth for the loins; the women in their blue petticoat and  braided hair were scraping the root of the cassava tree into a trough of  bark; it was then put into a long press of matting, which expresses the  poisonous juice; the dry farina is finally baked on an iron plate. The  old women were weaving the square coeoo or _lap_ of beads, which  they sometimes wear without a petticoat; also armlets and ankle  ornaments of beads. Some were fabricating earthen pots, and all the  females seemed actively employed. They offered us a red liquor, called  _caseeree_, prepared from the sweet potato; also _piwarry_,  the intoxicating beverage made by chewing the cassava, and allowing it  to ferment. At their _piwarry_ feasts the Indians prepare a small  canoe full of this liquor, beside which the entertainers and their  guests roll together drunk for two or three days. Their helpmates look  after them, and keep them from being suffocated with the sand getting  into their mouths: but _piwarry_ is a harmless liquor, that is to  say, it does not produce the disease and baneful effects of spirits, for  after a sleep the Indians rise fresh and well, and only occasionally  indulge in a debauch of this kind. Fish, which the men had shot with  their arrows, and birds, were brought out of the canoe, and barbacoted  or smoke-dried on a grating of bamboos over a fire; and we followed an  old man with a cutlass to their small fields of cassava, cleared by  girdling and burning a part of the forest behind the logies. These  Indians were of the Arrawak nation; we afterwards saw Caribs, Accaways,  &c.    The rivers and creeks, and the whole of the interior of British Guiana  at a distance from the sea, are unknown and unexplored. October and  November are the driest months in the year, and the best for expeditions  into the interior. I was unable to go as far up the river as I wished,  from the great freshes; the rain fell every day, yet I penetrated in all  directions as far as I could, and I trust to be able, at some more  favourable season, to return to that interesting country.    Two years ago, a Mr. Smith, a mercantile man from Caraccas, was joined  at George Town by a Lieutenant Gullifer, R.N. They proceeded down the  Pomeroon river, then up the Wyeena creek, travelled across to the  Coioony, sailed down it, and then went up the Essequibo to the Rio  Negro, which, it appears, connects the Amazons and Oroonoco rivers.  At Bara, on the Rio Negro, Mr. Smith, from sitting so long cramped up  in coorials or canoes, became affected with dropsy; and allowing himself  to be tapped by an ignorant quack, died after a fortnight's illness.  Lieutenant Gullifer sailed down the Rio Negro to the Amazons, and  remained at Para for some months, till he heard from England. From  domestic details he received at Para, he fell into low spirits, and  proceeded to Trinidad, where, one morning, he was found suspended to  a beam under the steeple of the Protestant church! His papers, and  Mr. Smith's, consisting of journals of their travels, were sent to a  brother of Lieutenant Gullifer's, on the Marocco coast of Essequibo,  where I went and saw the papers, and was most anxious to obtain them for  the Geographical Society; but Mr. Gullifer said that he must consult  first with the other relatives.    Among other interesting details I found in the notes, I may mention  the following:--High up the Essequibo they fell in with a nation of  anthropophagi, of the Carib tribe. The chief received the travellers  courteously, and placed before them fish with savoury sauce; which being  removed, two human hands were brought in, and a steak of human flesh!  The travellers thought that this might be part of a baboon of a new  species; however, they declined the invitation to partake, saying that,  in travelling, they were not allowed to eat animal food. The chief  picked the bones of the hands with excellent appetite, and asked them  how they had relished the fruit and the sauce. They replied that the  fish was good and the sauce excellent. To which he answered, \"Human  flesh makes the best sauce for any food; these hands and the fish were  all dressed together. You see these Macooshee men, our slaves; we lately  captured these people in war, and their wives we eat from time to time.\"  The travellers were horrified, but concealed their feelings, and before  they retired for the night, they remarked that the Macooshee females  were confined in a large logie, or shed, surrounded with a stockade of  bamboos; so that, daily the fathers, husbands, and brothers of these  unfortunate women, saw them brought out, knocked on the head, and  devoured by the inhuman cannibals. Lieutenant Gullifer, who was _in  bad condition_, got into his hammock and slept soundly; but Mr.  Smith, being in excellent case, walked about all night, fearing that  their landlord might take a fancy to a steak of white meat. They  afterwards visited a cave, in which was a pool of water; the Indians  requested them not to bathe in this, for if they did, they would die  before the year was out. They laughed at their monitors and bathed; but  sure enough were both \"clods of the valley\" before the twelvemonth had  expired.--_Journal of the Geographical Society_, Part 2.           *       *       *       *       *          Fine Arts.           *       *       *       *       *    CELEBRATED PAINTERS BORN AT ANTWERP.

Call all hands, Mr. Boulong, and clear away the first  cutter.\"    By this time the Guardian-Mother was on her course to the northward. The  storm was severe, but not as savage as it might have been, or as the  steamer had encountered on the Atlantic when she saved the sailing-yacht  Blanche from foundering. The ship had been kept on her course for Bombay,  though, as she had the gale on the beam, she was condemned to wallow in the  trough of the sea; and stiff and able as she was, she rolled heavily, as  any vessel would have done under the same conditions.    The change of course gave her the wind very nearly over the stern, and she  pitched instead of rolling, sometimes lifting her propeller almost out of  the water, which made it whirl like a top, and then burying it deep in the  waves, causing it to moan and groan and shake the whole after part of the  ship, rousing all the party in the cabin from their slumbers. The ship had  hardly changed her course before Louis came on deck, and was soon followed  by Felix McGavonty.    \"What's the row, Mr. Scott?\" asked the former.    \"Are ye's thryin' to shake the screw out of her?\" inquired the Milesian,  who could talk as good English as his crony, the owner, but who  occasionally made use of the brogue to prevent him from forgetting his  mother tongue, as he put it, though he was born in the United States.  \"Don't ye's do it; for sure, you will want it 'fore we get to Bombay.\"    \"Don't you see those men standing upon something, or clinging to whatever  floats them? They are having a close call; but I hope we shall be able to  save them,\" replied the third officer.    The captain had gone to the pilot-house, from the windows of which the  wreck could be seen very plainly, as its distance from the ship was rapidly  reduced. By this time the entire crew had rushed to the deck, and were  waiting for orders on the forecastle. Mr. Boulong, with his boat's crew,  had gone to the starboard quarter, where the first cutter was swung in on  her davits. The boat pulled six oars, and the cockswain made seven hands.    With these the cutter wad quickly swung out, and the crew took their places  in her, the bowman at the forward tackle, and the cockswain at the after.  It was the same crew with which the first officer had boarded the Blanche  when she was in imminent peril of going down, and he had entire confidence  both in their will and their muscle. He stood on the rail, holding on at  the main shrouds, ready for further orders.    In the pilot-house, with both quartermasters at the wheel, the captain was  still observing with his glass the men in momentary peril of being washed  from their insecure position into the boiling sea. Felix had gone aft with  the first officer, and had assisted in shoving out the first cutter from  the skids inboard, and Louis had come into the pilot-house with Scott.    \"Has any one counted the number of men on the wreck, or whatever it is?\"  inquired the commander.    \"There are eleven of them,\" promptly replied Scott, who, as an officer of  the ship, was in his element, and very active both in mind and body.    \"Too many for one boat in a heavy sea,\" added Captain Ringgold. \"You will  clear away the second cutter, Mr. Scott, and follow Mr. Boulong to the  wreck.\"    \"All the second cutters aft!\" shouted the third officer from the window;  and the crew of this boat rushed up the ladder to the promenade deck, and  followed the life-line to the davits of the cutter.    \"Bargate, who pulls the stroke oar in the second cutter, has the rheumatism  in his right arm, and is not fit to go in the boat,\" interposed Mr.  Gaskette, the second officer.    \"Let me take his place, Captain Ringgold!\" eagerly exclaimed Louis  Belgrave.    \"Do you think you can pull an oar in a heavy seaway, Mr. Belgrave?\" asked  the commander, who always treated the owner with entire respect in the  presence of others, though he called him by his given name when they were  alone.    \"I know I can!\" replied Louis very confidently.    \"I do not object, if Mr. Scott is willing.\"    \"I am very willing, for Mr. Belgrave's muscle is as hard as a flint.\"    \"Very well. Hurry up!\" added the captain.    Four other men were sent aft to assist in the preparations for putting the  second cutter into the water; and in as short a time as Mr. Gaskette, who  usually went in that boat on important occasions, would have required to do  it, the cutter was ready to be dropped into the water when the order was  given.    The captain and the second officer continued to watch the party on the  wreck, expecting every moment to see some of them swept into the savage  waves that beat against their frail support. The ship went at full speed on  her course; for the commander would not waste an instant while the lives of  so many human beings depended upon his action.    \"Can you make out what they are clinging to, Mr. Gaskette?\" asked the  commander of the only person besides the two quartermasters who remained  with him in the pilot-house.    \"Yes, sir; I am just getting an idea in regard to it, though the thing is  awash so that I can hardly make it out,\" replied the second officer. \"I  think it is the bottom of a rather small vessel, upside down; for I see  something like a keel. The party have two ropes stretched the whole length  of the bottom, to which they are clinging.\"    \"You are right; that is plainly the bottom of a vessel, and I wonder that  the craft has not gone down by this time. How she happens to be in that  situation, and why she has not sunk, are matters yet to be explained. Go  aft, if you please, and see that both cutters are ready to be lowered into  the water, Mr. Gaskette. It is not prudent to go much nearer to the wreck,  for the gale may drift us upon it.\"    The second officer left the pilot-house, and found the crews all seated in  their boats, with everything in readiness to obey the order to lower away;  and he reported the fact to his superior.    \"Starboard the helm, Bangs, and steer small!\" said Captain Ringgold as soon  as the officer returned with the information he had obtained.    To \"steer small\" is to move the rudder very gradually; for if the course  were suddenly changed a quarter of the circumference of the compass in such  a sea as was then raging, it would be liable to make the steamer engage in  some disagreeable, if not dangerous, antics.    \"Steady!\" added the captain when the steamer was headed a point south of  west.    This position brought the starboard side of the ship on the lee; that is,  this part of the ship was sheltered from the fury of the wind and the  waves, and it was the proper situation in which to lower a boat into the  water; for on the windward side these two powerful forces would be likely  to stave the cutter against the side of the steamer.    After the commander had struck the gong to stop her, he gave the order to  the second officer to lower the first cutter; and he left the pilot-house  for this purpose. Mr. Boulong was an exceptionally skilful officer in the  handling of a boat in a heavy sea. Watching for the favorable moment, he  gave the order to the cockswain and bowman to lower away, with the aid of  the oarsmen near them.    \"Cast off the after fall, Stoody!\" said he sharply to the cockswain; and  the order was promptly obeyed. \"Cast off your fall, Knott!\" he added almost  instantly. \"Let fall! Give way!\"    A receding wave carried the boat away from the side of the ship, precisely  as Mr. Boulong had calculated. The six oars dropped into the water as one,  and the men began to pull, getting a firm hold on the receding wave, which  sent the cutter to a safe distance from the ship. As soon as she was clear,  the commander, who had remained in the pilot-house, rang the gong to go  ahead. When the steamer had gathered sufficient headway, she was brought  about as cautiously as before.    The second cutter was on the port quarter of the vessel, and this movement  placed the boat under the lee. Mr. Gaskette had remained aft, and when the  ship had stopped her screw and nearly lost her headway, the captain shouted  to him through his speaking-trumpet, which the roar of the waves and the  escaping steam rendered necessary, to \"Lower away!\"    \"Lower away when you are ready, Mr. Scott!\" repeated the second officer.    Though Scott was only eighteen years old, he was an intuitive sailor, and  had a good deal of experience for his years. He had never before occupied  his present position; but his nautical genius, fortified by sundry combats  with wind and waves, made him feel quite at home. As the first officer had  done, he seized the auspicious moment when the retiring wave promised its  efficient aid, and gave the orders to cast off the falls.    The six oars grappled with the water on the smooth side of a great wave,  and carried it to the apex of the next billow; and she went off as  handsomely as the first cutter had done. Mr. Gaskette saw these manoeuvres  successfully accomplished, and then started for the pilot-house, to report  to the captain. On his way he could not help giving an inquiring look at  the manner in which the substitute for Bargate performed his duty.    At eighteen Louis was a healthy, vigorous, athletic fellow, developed by an  active life on the ocean, and weighing one hundred and fifty pounds. In any  trial of strength he was more than the equal of any other member of the  \"Big Four,\" as the four young men berthing in the cabin called themselves,  borrowing the name from a combination of railroads in the West. He was well  trained as an oarsman, and the second officer was satisfied that he was  doing his full share of the work.    "]]]
