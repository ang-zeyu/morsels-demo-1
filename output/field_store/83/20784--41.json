Paul's zeal for the Gospel becomes so fervent that it almost leads him  to curse angels. \"I would rather that I, my brethren, yes, the angels of  heaven be anathematized than that my gospel be overthrown.\"    The Greek word _anathema_, Hebrew _herem_, means to accurse, execrate,  to damn. Paul first (hypothetically) curses himself. Knowing persons  first find fault with themselves in order that they may all the more  earnestly reprove others.    Paul maintains that there is no other gospel besides the one he  had preached to the Galatians. He preached, not a gospel of his own  invention, but the very same Gospel God had long ago prescribed in the  Sacred Scriptures. No wonder Paul pronounces curses upon himself and  upon others, upon the angels of heaven, if anyone should dare to preach  any other gospel than Christ's own.        VERSE 9. As we said before, so say I now again. If any man preach    any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be    accursed.    Paul repeats the curse, directing it now upon other persons. Before, he  cursed himself, his brethren, and an angel from heaven. \"Now,\" he says,  \"if there are any others who preach a gospel different from that you  have received from us, let them also be accursed.\" Paul herewith curses  and excommunicates all false teachers including his opponents. He is so  worked up that he dares to curse all who pervert his Gospel. Would to  God that this terrible pronouncement of the Apostle might strike fear  into the hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul.    The Galatians might say: \"Paul, we do not pervert the Gospel you have  brought unto us. We did not quite understand it. That is all. Now these  teachers who came after you have explained everything so beautifully.\"  This explanation the Apostle refuses to accept. They must add nothing;  they must correct nothing. \"What you received from me is the genuine  Gospel of God. Let it stand. If any man brings any other gospel than the  one I brought you, or promises to deliver better things than you have  received from me, let him be accursed.\"    In spite of this emphatic denunciation so many accept the pope as the  supreme judge of the Scriptures. \"The Church,\" they say, \"chose only  four gospels. The Church might have chosen more. Ergo the Church is  above the Gospel.\" With equal force one might argue: \"I approve the  Scriptures. Ergo I am above the Scriptures. John the Baptist confessed  Christ. Hence he is above Christ.\" Paul subordinates himself, all  preachers, all the angels of heaven, everybody to the Sacred Scriptures.  We are not the masters, judges, or arbiters, but witnesses, disciples,  and confessors of the Scriptures, whether we be pope, Luther, Augustine,  Paul, or an angel from heaven.        VERSE 10. For do I now persuade men, or God?    With the same vehemence Paul continues: \"You Galatians ought to be able  to tell from my preaching and from the many afflictions which I have  endured, whether I serve men or God. Everybody can see that my preaching  has stirred up persecution against me everywhere, and has earned for me  the cruel hatred of my own people, in fact the hatred of all men. This  should convince you that by my preaching I do not seek the favor and  praise of men, but the glory of God.\"    No man can say that we are seeking the favor and praise of men with our  doctrine. We teach that all men are naturally depraved. We condemn  man's free will, his strength, wisdom, and righteousness. We say that we  obtain grace by the free mercy of God alone for Christ's sake. This is  no preaching to please men. This sort of preaching procures for us  the hatred and disfavor of the world, persecutions, excommunications,  murders, and curses.    \"Can't you see that I seek no man's favor by my doctrine?\" asks Paul.  \"If I were anxious for the favor of men I would flatter them. But what  do I do? I condemn their works. I teach things only that I have been  commanded to teach from above. For that I bring down upon my head  the wrath of Jews and Gentiles. My doctrine must be right. It must  be divine. Any other doctrine cannot be better than mine. Any other  doctrine must be false and wicked.\"    With Paul we boldly pronounce a curse upon every doctrine that does not  agree with ours. We do not preach for the praise of men, or the favor of  princes. We preach for the favor of God alone whose grace and mercy we  proclaim. Whosoever teaches a gospel contrary to ours, or different from  ours, let us be bold to say that he is sent of the devil.        VERSE 10. Or do I seek to please men?    \"Do I serve men or God?\" Paul keeps an eye on the false apostles, those  flatterers of men. They taught circumcision to avoid the hatred and  persecution of men.    To this day you will find many who seek to please men in order that they  may live in peace and security. They teach whatever is agreeable to men,  no matter whether it is contrary to God's Word or their own conscience.  But we who endeavor to please God and not men, stir up hell itself. We  must suffer reproach, slanders, death.    For those who go about to please men we have a word from Christ recorded  in the fifth chapter of St. John: \"How can ye believe, which receive  honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God  alone?\"        VERSE 10. For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of    Christ.    Observe the consummate cleverness with which the false apostles went  about to bring Paul into disrepute. They combed Paul's writings for  contradictions (our opponents do the same) to accuse him of teaching  contradictory things. They found that Paul had circumcised Timothy  according to the Law, that Paul had purified himself with four other men  in the Temple at Jerusalem, that Paul had shaven his head at Cenchrea.  The false apostles slyly suggested that Paul had been constrained by  the other apostles to observe these ceremonial laws. We know that Paul  observed these _decora_ out of charitable regard for the weak brethren.  He did not want to offend them. But the false apostles turned Paul's  charitable regard to his disadvantage. If Paul had preached the Law and  circumcision, if he had commended the strength and free will of man, he  would not have been so obnoxious to the Jews. On the contrary they would  have praised his every action.        VERSES 11, 12. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which    was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of    man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.    This passage constitutes Paul's chief defense against the accusations of  his opponents. He maintains under oath that he received his Gospel not  from men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.    In declaring that his Gospel is not after man, Paul does not merely wish  to state that his Gospel is not mundane. The false apostles made the  same claim for their gospel. Paul means to say that he learned his  Gospel not in the usual and accepted manner through the agency of men  by hearing, reading, or writing. He received the Gospel by special  revelation directly from Jesus Christ.    Paul received his Gospel on the way to Damascus when Christ appeared to  him. St. Luke furnishes an account of the incident in the ninth chapter  of the Book of Acts. \"Arise,\" said Christ to Paul, \"and go into the  city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\" Christ did not send  Paul into the city to learn the Gospel from Ananias. Ananias was only  to baptize Paul, to lay his hands on Paul, to commit the ministry of the  Word unto Paul, and to recommend him to the Church. Ananias recognized  his limited assignment when he said to Paul: \"Brother Saul, the Lord,  even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent  me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy  Ghost.\" Paul did not receive instruction from Ananias. Paul had already  been called, enlightened, and taught by Christ in the road. His contact  with Ananias was merely a testimonial to the fact that Paul had been  called by Christ to preach the Gospel.    Paul was forced to speak of his conversion to combat the slanderous  contention of the false apostles to the effect that this apostleship was  inferior to that of the other apostles.    If it were not for the example of the Galatian churches I would never  have thought it possible that anybody who had received the Word of God  with such eagerness as they had, could so quickly let go of it. Good  Lord, what terrible mischief one single false statement can create.    The article of justification is fragile. Not in itself, of course, but  in us. I know how quickly a person can forfeit the joy of the Gospel.  I know in what slippery places even those stand who seem to have a good  footing in the matters of faith. In the midst of the conflict when we  should be consoling ourselves with the Gospel, the Law rears up and  begins to rage all over our conscience. I say the Gospel is frail  because we are frail.    What makes matters worse is that one-half of ourselves, our own reason,  stands against us. The flesh resists the spirit, or as Paul puts it,  \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit.\" Therefore we teach that to know  Christ and to believe in Him is no achievement of man, but the gift of  God. God alone can create and preserve faith in us. God creates faith in  us through the Word. He increases, strengthens and confirms faith in us  through His word. Hence the best service that anybody can render God is  diligently to hear and read God's Word. On the other hand, nothing is  more perilous than to be weary of the Word of God. Thinking he knows  enough, a person begins little by little to despise the Word until he  has lost Christ and the Gospel altogether.    Let every believer carefully learn the Gospel. Let him continue in  humble prayer.

Life and color in interpretation are the true  secrets of great art. And beauty of interpretation depends, first of  all, on variety of color. Technic is, after all, only secondary. No  matter how well played a composition be, its performance must have  color, _nuance_, movement, life! Each emotional mood of the moment must  be fully expressed, and if it is its appeal is sure. I remember when I  once played for Don Manuel, the young ex-king of Portugal, in London, I  had an illustration of the fact. He was just a pathetic boy, very  democratic, and personally very likable. He was somewhat neglected at  the time, for it is well known and not altogether unnatural, that  royalty securely established finds 'kings in exile' a bit embarrassing.  Don Manuel was a music-lover, and especially fond of Bach. I had had  long talks with the young king at various times, and my sympathies had  been aroused in his behalf. On the evening of which I speak I played a  Chopin _Nocturne_, and I know that into my playing there went some of my  feeling for the pathos of the situation of this young stranger in a  strange land, of my own age, eating the bitter bread of exile. When I  had finished, the Marchioness of Ripon touched my arm: 'Look at the  King!' she whispered. Don Manuel had been moved to tears.    \"Of course the purely mechanical must always be dominated by the  artistic personality of the player. Yet technic is also an important  part of interpretation: knowing exactly how long to hold a bow, the most  delicate inflections of its pressure on the strings. There must be  perfect sympathy also with the composer's thought; his spirit must stand  behind the personality of the artist. In the case of certain famous  compositions, like the Beethoven concerto, for instance, this is so well  established that the artist, and never the composer, is held responsible  if it is not well played. But too rigorous an adherence to 'tradition'  in playing is also an extreme. I once played privately for Joachim in  Berlin: it was the Bach _Chaconne_. Now the edition I used was a  standard one: and Joachim was extremely reverential as regards  traditions. Yet he did not hesitate to indicate some changes which he  thought should be made in the version of an authoritative edition,  because 'they sounded better.' And 'How does it sound?' is really the  true test of all interpretation.\"                     ABSOLUTE PITCH THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF A                             PERFECTED TECHNIC    \"What is the fundamental of a perfected violin technic?\" was a natural  question at this point. \"Absolute pitch, first of all,\" replied Elman  promptly. \"Many a violinist plays a difficult passage, sounding every  note; and yet it sounds out of tune. The first and second movements of  the Beethoven concerto have no double-stops; yet they are extremely  difficult to play. Why? Because they call for absolute pitch: they must  be played in perfect tune so that each tone stands out in all its  fullness and clarity like a rock in the sea. And without a fundamental  control of pitch such a master work will always be beyond the  violinist's reach. Many a player has the facility; but without perfect  intonation he can never attain the highest perfection. On the other  hand, any one who can play a single phrase in absolute pitch has the  first and great essential. Few artists, not barring some of the  greatest, play with perfect intonation. Its control depends first of all  on the ear. And a sensitive ear finds differences and shading; it bids  the violinist play a trifle sharper, a trifle flatter, according to the  general harmonic color of the accompaniment; it leads him to observe a  difference, when the harmonic atmosphere demands it, between a C sharp  in the key of E major and a D flat in the same key.                                  TECHNICAL PHASES    \"Every player finds some phases of technic easy and others difficult.  For instance, I have never had to work hard for quality of tone--when I  wish to get certain color effects they come: I have no difficulty in  expressing my feelings, my emotions in tone. And in a technical way  _spiccato_ bowing, which many find so hard, has always been easy to me.  I have never had to work for it. Double-stops, on the contrary, cost me  hours of intensive work before I played them with ease and facility.  What did I practice? Scales in double-stops--they give color and variety  to tone. And I gave up a certain portion of my regular practice time to  passages from concertos and sonatas. There is wonderful work in  double-stops in the Ernst concerto and in the Paganini _Etudes_, for  instance. With octaves and tenths I have never had any trouble: I have a  broad hand and a wide stretch, which accounts for it, I suppose.    \"Then there are harmonics, flageolets--I, have never been able to  understand why they should be considered so difficult! They should not  be white, colorless; but call for just as much color as any other tones  (and any one who has heard Mischa Elman play harmonics knows that this  is no mere theory on his part). I never think of harmonics as  'harmonics,' but try to give them just as much expressive quality as the  notes of any other register. The mental attitude should influence their  production--too many violinists think of them only as incidental to  pyrotechnical display.    \"And fingering? Fingering in general seems to me to be an individual  matter. A concert artist may use a certain fingering for a certain  passage which no pupil should use, and be entirely justified if he can  thus secure a certain effect.    \"I do not--speaking out of my own experience--believe much in methods:  and never to the extent that they be allowed to kill the student's  individuality. A clear, clean tone should always be the ideal of his  striving. And to that end he must see that the up and down bows in a  passage like the following from the Bach sonata in A minor (and Mr.  Elman hastily jotted down the subjoined) are absolutely                       [Illustration: Musical Notation]    even, and of the same length, played with the same strength and length  of bow, otherwise the notes are swallowed. In light _spiccato_ and  _staccato_ the detached notes should be played always with a single  stroke of the bow. Some players, strange to say, find _staccato_ notes  more difficult to play at a moderate tempo than fast. I believe it to be  altogether a matter of control--if proper control be there the tempo  makes no difference. Wieniawski, I have read, could only play his  _staccati_ at a high rate of speed. _Spiccato_ is generally held to be  more difficult than _staccato_; yet I myself find it easier.                              PROPORTION IN PRACTICE    \"To influence a clear, singing tone with the left hand, to phrase it  properly with the bow hand, is most important. And it is a matter of  proportion. Good phrasing is spoiled by an ugly tone: a beautiful  singing tone loses meaning if improperly phrased. When the student has  reached a certain point of technical development, technic must be a  secondary--yet not neglected--consideration, and he should devote  himself to the production of a good tone. Many violinists have missed  their career by exaggerated attention to either bow or violin hand. Both  hands must be watched at the same time. And the question of proportion  should always be kept in mind in practicing studies and passages:  pressure of fingers and pressure of bow must be equalized, coordinated.  The teacher can only do a certain amount: the pupil must do the rest.                                 AUER AS A TEACHER    \"Take Auer for example. I may call myself the first real exponent of his  school, in the sense of making his name widely known. Auer is a great  teacher, and leaves much to the individuality of his pupils. He first  heard me play at the Imperial Music School in Odessa, and took me to  Petrograd to study with him, which I did for a year and four months. And  he could accomplish wonders! That one year he had a little group of four  pupils each one better than the other--a very stimulating situation for  all of them. There was a magnetism about him: he literally hypnotized  his pupils into doing better than their best--though in some cases it  was evident that once the support of his magnetic personality was  withdrawn, the pupil fell back into the level from which he had been  raised for the time being.    \"Yet Auer respected the fact that temperamentally I was not responsive  to this form of appeal. He gave me of his best. I never practiced more  than two or three hours a day--just enough to keep fresh. Often I came  to my lesson unprepared, and he would have me play things--sonatas,  concertos--which I had not touched for a year or more. He was a severe  critic, but always a just one.    \"I can recall how proud I was when he sent me to beautiful music-loving  Helsingfors, in Finland--where all seems to be bloodshed and confusion  now--to play a recital in his own stead on one occasion, and how proud  he was of my success. Yet Auer had his little peculiarities. I have read  somewhere that the great fencing-masters of the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries were very jealous of the secrets of their famous  feints and _ripostes_, and only confided them to favorite pupils who  promised not to reveal them. Auer had his little secrets, too, with  which he was loth to part. When I was to make my _debut_ in Berlin, I  remember, he was naturally enough interested--since I was his pupil--in  my scoring a triumph. And he decided to part with some of his treasured  technical thrusts and parries. And when I was going over the  Tschaikovsky _D minor concerto_ (which I was to play), he would select a  passage and say: 'Now I'll play this for you. If you catch it, well and  good; if not it is your own fault!' I am happy to say that I did"]]]
