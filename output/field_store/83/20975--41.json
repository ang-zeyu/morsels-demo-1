[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#6)"],[1," cap. 3._]    2. Though we could not by our senses see such alterations, yet our  reason might perhaps sufficiently convince us of them. Nor can we well  conceive how the Sunne should reflect against the Moone, and yet not  produce some alteration of heate. _Diogenes_ the Philosopher was hence  perswaded that those scorching heates had burnt the Moone into the forme  of a Pumice-stone.    3. I answer that there have been some alterations observed there;  witnesse those comets which have beene seene above the Moone. So that  though _Aristotles_ consequence were sufficient, when hee proved that  the heavens were not corruptible, because there have not any changes  being observed in it, yet this by the same reason must bee as prevalent,  that the Heavens are corruptible, because there have beene so many  alterations observed there; but of these together with a farther  confirmation of this proposition, I shall have occasion to speake  afterwards; In the meane space, I will referre the Reader to that worke  of _Scheiner_ a late Jesuit which hee titles his _Rosa Vrsina_,[1] where  hee may see this point concerning the corruptibility of the Heavens  largely handled and sufficiently confirmed.      [Sidenote 1: _lib. 4. p. 2. cy. 24, 35._]    There are some other things, on which I might here take an occasion to  enlarge my selfe, but because they are directly handled by many others,  and doe not immediately belong to the chiefe matter in hand, I shall  therefore referre the Reader to their authors, and omit any large proofe  of them my selfe, as defining all possible brevity.    1. The first is this: That there are no solid Orbes. If there be a  habitable World in the Moone (which I now affirme) it must follow, that  her Orbe is not solid, as _Aristotle_ supposed; and if not her, why any  of the other? I rather thinke that they are all of a fluid (perhaps  aereous) substance. Saint _Ambrose_, and Saint _Basil_[1] did endeavour  to prove this out of that place in _Isay_,[2] where they are compared to  smoake, as they are both quoted by _Rhodiginus_, _Eusebius_,  _Nierembergius_[3] doth likewise from that place confute the solidity  and incorruptibility of the Heavens, and cites for the same  interpretation the authority of _Eustachius_ of _Antioch_; and Saint  _Austin_,[4] I am sure seemes to assent unto this opinion, though he  does often in his other workes contradict it. The testimony of other  Fathers to this purpose you may see in _Sixtus Senensis. l. 5. Biblioth.  annot. 14._ but for your better satisfaction herein, I shall referre you  to the above named _Scheiner_ in his _Rosa Ursina_,[5] in whom you may  see both authorities and reason, and very largely and distinctly set  downe for this opinion, for the better confirmation of which hee  adjoynes also some authenticall Epistles of _Fredericus Caesius Lynceus_  a Noble Prince written to _Bellarmine_, containing divers reasons to the  same purpose, you may also see the same truth set downe by _Johannes  Pena_ in his preface to _Euclids Opticks_, and _Christoph. Rothmannus_,  both who thought the Firmament to bee onely aire: and though the noble  _Tycho_[6] doe dispute against them, yet he himselfe holds,      _Quod propius ad veritatis penetralia accedit haec opinio, quam    Aristotelica vulgariter approbata, quae coelum pluribus realibus atque    imperviis orbibus citra rem replevit._      \"That this opinion comes neerer to the truth than that common one    of _Aristotle_ which hath to no purpose filled the heavens with such    reall and impervious Orbes.\"      [Sidenote 1: _Isa. 51. 6._]      [Sidenote 2: _Ant. lect. l. 1. c. 4._]      [Sidenote 3: _Hist. nat. l. 2. c. 11. 13._]      [Sidenote 4: _In lib. sup. Gen. ad lit._]      [Sidenote 5: _lib. 4. p. 11, 2. c. 7. 26, 30._]      [Sidenote 6: _De stella. 15. 72. l. 6. c. 9._]    2. There is no element of fire, which must be held with this opinion  here delivered; for if wee suppose a world in the Moone, then it will  follow, that the spheare of fire, either is not there where 'tis usually  placed in the concavity of his Orbe, or else that there is no such thing  at all, which is most probable, since there are not any such solid Orbs,  that by their swift motion might heare and enkindle the adjoyning aire,  which is imagined to be the reason of that element. Concerning this see  _Cardan_, _Iohannes Pena_ that learned _Frenchman_, the noble _Tycho_,  with divers others who have purposely handled this proposition.    3. I might adde a third, _viz._ that there is no Musicke of the  spheares, for if they be not solid, how can their motion cause any such  sound as is conceived? I doe the rather medle with this, because  _Plutarch_ speaks as if a man might very conveniently heare that  harmony, if he were an inhabitant in the Moone. But I guesse that hee  said this out of incogitancy, and did not well consider those necessary  consequences which depended upon his opinion. However the world would  have no great losse in being deprived of this Musicke, unlesse at some  times we had the priviledge to heare it: Then indeede _Philo_ the Jew[1]  thinkes it would save us the charges of diet, and we might live at an  easie rate by feeding at the eare onely, and receiving no other  nourishment; and for this very reason (saies he) was _Moses_ enabled to  tarry forty daies and forty nights in the Mount without eating any  thing, because he there heard the melody of the Heavens,--_Risum  teneatis_. I know this Musicke hath had great patrons both sacred and  prophane authours, such as _Ambrose_, _Bede_, _Boetius_, _Anselme_,  _Plato_, _Cicero_ and others, but because it is not now, I thinke  affirmed by any, I shall not therefore bestow either paines or time in  arguing against it.      [Sidenote 1: _De somniis._]    It may suffice that I have onely named these three last, and for the two  more necessary, have referred the Reader to others for satisfaction. I  shall in the next place proceede to the nature of the Moones body, to  know whether that be capable of any such conditions, as may make it  possible to be inhabited, and what those qualities are wherein it more  neerely agrees with our earth.          Proposition 4.    _That the Moone is a solid, compacted, opacous body._      I shall not need to stand long in the proofe of this proposition, since  it is a truth already agreed on by the generall consent of the most and  the best Philosophers.    1. It is solid in opposition to fluid, as is the ayre, for how otherwise  could it beare backe the light which it receives from the Sunne?    But here it may be questioned, whether or no the Moone bestow her light  upon us by the reflection of the Sunne-beames from the superficies of  her body, or else by her owne illumination. Some there are who affirme  this latter part. So _Averroes_, _Caelius Rhodiginus_, _Iulius Caesar_,  _&c._ and their reason is because this light is discerned in many  places,[1] whereas those bodies which give light by reflexion can there  onely be perceived where the angle of reflexion is equall to the angle  of incidence, and this is onely in one place, as in a looking-glasse  those beames which are reflected from it cannot bee perceived in every  place where you may see the glasse, but onely there where your eye is  placed on the same line whereon the beames are reflected.      [Sidenote 1: _De coelo. l. 2. com. 49._    _Ant. lection. l. 20. c. 4._    _De phaenom. lunae. c. 11._]    But to this I answere, that the argument will not hold of such bodies,  whose superficies is full of unequall parts and gibbosities as the Moone  is. Wherefore it is as well the more probable as the more common  opinion, that her light proceedes from both these causes, from reflexion  and illumination; nor doth it herein differ from our earth, since that  also hath some light by illumination: for how otherwise would the parts  about us in a Sunne-shine day appeare so bright, when as all the rayes  of reflexion cannot enter into our eye?    2. It is compact, and not a spungie and porous substance.[1] But this is  denied by _Diogenes_, _Vitellio_, and _Reinoldus_, and some others, who  held the Moone to bee of the same kind of nature as a Pumice-stone, and  this, say they, is the reason why in the Suns eclipses there appeares  within her a duskish ruddy colour, because the Sunne-beames being  refracted in passing through the pores of her body, must necessarily be  represented under such a colour.      [Sidenote 1: _Plut. de pla. phil. l. 2. c. 13._    _Opt. l. 4._    _Com. Purbac. Theo. p. 164._]    But I reply, if this be the cause of her rednesse; then why doth she not  appeare under the same forme when she is about a sextile aspect, and the  darkned part of her body is discernable? for then also doe the same  rayes passe through her, and therefore in all likelihood should produce  the same effect, and notwithstanding those beames are then diverted from  us, that they cannot enter into our eyes by a streight line, yet must  the colour still remaine visible in her body,[1] and besides according  to this opinion, the spots would not alwaies be the same, but divers, as  the various distance of the Sunne requires. Againe, if the Sunne-beames  did passe through her, why then hath she not a taile as the Comets? why  doth she appeare in such an exact round? and not rather attended with a  long flame, since it is meerely this penetration of the Sunne beames  that is usually attributed to be the cause of beards in blazing starres.      [Sidenote 1: _Scaliger exercit. 80. Sec. 13._]    3. It is opacous, not transparent or diaphanous like Chrystall or  glasse,[1] as _Empedocles_ thought, who held the Moone to bee a globe of  pure congealed aire, like haile inclosed in a spheare of fire, for then.      [Sidenote 1: _Plut. de fa. lunae._]    1. Why does shee not alwaies appeare in the full? since the light is  dispersed through all her body?    2. How can the interposition of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1911"],[0,"Concerning Christian Liberty; with Letter of Martin Luther to Pope Leo X. (#6)"],[1,"into sin, nor  does he ever appear in the presence of God, because God does not hear  sinners.    Who then can comprehend the loftiness of that Christian dignity which,  by its royal power, rules over all things, even over death, life, and  sin, and, by its priestly glory, is all-powerful with God, since God  does what He Himself seeks and wishes, as it is written, \"He will fulfil  the desire of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will  save them\"? (Psalm cxlv. 19). This glory certainly cannot be attained by  any works, but by faith only.    From these considerations any one may clearly see how a Christian  man is free from all things; so that he needs no works in order to be  justified and saved, but receives these gifts in abundance from faith  alone. Nay, were he so foolish as to pretend to be justified, set  free, saved, and made a Christian, by means of any good work, he would  immediately lose faith, with all its benefits. Such folly is prettily  represented in the fable where a dog, running along in the water  and carrying in his mouth a real piece of meat, is deceived by the  reflection of the meat in the water, and, in trying with open mouth to  seize it, loses the meat and its image at the same time.    Here you will ask, \"If all who are in the Church are priests, by what  character are those whom we now call priests to be distinguished from  the laity?\" I reply, By the use of these words, \"priest,\" \"clergy,\"  \"spiritual person,\" \"ecclesiastic,\" an injustice has been done, since  they have been transferred from the remaining body of Christians to  those few who are now, by hurtful custom, called ecclesiastics. For Holy  Scripture makes no distinction between them, except that those who are  now boastfully called popes, bishops, and lords, it calls ministers,  servants, and stewards, who are to serve the rest in the ministry of the  word, for teaching the faith of Christ and the liberty of believers. For  though it is true that we are all equally priests, yet we cannot, nor,  if we could, ought we all to, minister and teach publicly. Thus Paul  says, \"Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and  stewards of the mysteries of God\" (1 Cor. iv. 1).    This bad system has now issued in such a pompous display of power and  such a terrible tyranny that no earthly government can be compared to  it, as if the laity were something else than Christians. Through this  perversion of things it has happened that the knowledge of Christian  grace, of faith, of liberty, and altogether of Christ, has utterly  perished, and has been succeeded by an intolerable bondage to human  works and laws; and, according to the Lamentations of Jeremiah, we have  become the slaves of the vilest men on earth, who abuse our misery to  all the disgraceful and ignominious purposes of their own will.    Returning to the subject which we had begun, I think it is made clear by  these considerations that it is not sufficient, nor a Christian course,  to preach the works, life, and words of Christ in a historic manner, as  facts which it suffices to know as an example how to frame our life, as  do those who are now held the best preachers, and much less so to keep  silence altogether on these things and to teach in their stead the laws  of men and the decrees of the Fathers. There are now not a few persons  who preach and read about Christ with the object of moving the human  affections to sympathise with Christ, to indignation against the Jews,  and other childish and womanish absurdities of that kind.    Now preaching ought to have the object of promoting faith in Him, so  that He may not only be Christ, but a Christ for you and for me, and  that what is said of Him, and what He is called, may work in us. And  this faith is produced and is maintained by preaching why Christ came,  what He has brought us and given to us, and to what profit and advantage  He is to be received. This is done when the Christian liberty which we  have from Christ Himself is rightly taught, and we are shown in what  manner all we Christians are kings and priests, and how we are lords of  all things, and may be confident that whatever we do in the presence of  God is pleasing and acceptable to Him.    Whose heart would not rejoice in its inmost core at hearing these  things? Whose heart, on receiving so great a consolation, would not  become sweet with the love of Christ, a love to which it can never  attain by any laws or works? Who can injure such a heart, or make it  afraid? If the consciousness of sin or the horror of death rush in upon  it, it is prepared to hope in the Lord, and is fearless of such evils,  and undisturbed, until it shall look down upon its enemies. For it  believes that the righteousness of Christ is its own, and that its sin  is no longer its own, but that of Christ; but, on account of its faith  in Christ, all its sin must needs be swallowed up from before the face  of the righteousness of Christ, as I have said above. It learns, too,  with the Apostle, to scoff at death and sin, and to say, \"O death, where  is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin,  and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth  us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (1 Cor. xv. 55-57). For  death is swallowed up in victory, not only the victory of Christ, but  ours also, since by faith it becomes ours, and in it we too conquer.    Let it suffice to say this concerning the inner man and its liberty, and  concerning that righteousness of faith which needs neither laws nor  good works; nay, they are even hurtful to it, if any one pretends to be  justified by them.    And now let us turn to the other part: to the outward man. Here we shall  give an answer to all those who, taking offence at the word of faith and  at what I have asserted, say, \"If faith does everything, and by itself  suffices for justification, why then are good works commanded? Are we  then to take our ease and do no works, content with faith?\" Not so,  impious men, I reply; not so. That would indeed really be the case, if  we were thoroughly and completely inner and spiritual persons; but that  will not happen until the last day, when the dead shall be raised. As  long as we live in the flesh, we are but beginning and making advances  in that which shall be completed in a future life. On this account the  Apostle calls that which we have in this life the firstfruits of the  Spirit (Rom. viii. 23). In future we shall have the tenths, and the  fullness of the Spirit. To this part belongs the fact I have stated  before: that the Christian is the servant of all and subject to all. For  in that part in which he is free he does no works, but in that in which  he is a servant he does all works. Let us see on what principle this is  so.    Although, as I have said, inwardly, and according to the spirit, a man  is amply enough justified by faith, having all that he requires to have,  except that this very faith and abundance ought to increase from day  to day, even till the future life, still he remains in this mortal life  upon earth, in which it is necessary that he should rule his own body  and have intercourse with men. Here then works begin; here he must not  take his ease; here he must give heed to exercise his body by fastings,  watchings, labour, and other regular discipline, so that it may be  subdued to the spirit, and obey and conform itself to the inner man and  faith, and not rebel against them nor hinder them, as is its nature to  do if it is not kept under. For the inner man, being conformed to God  and created after the image of God through faith, rejoices and delights  itself in Christ, in whom such blessings have been conferred on it, and  hence has only this task before it: to serve God with joy and for nought  in free love.    But in doing this he comes into collision with that contrary will in  his own flesh, which is striving to serve the world and to seek its own  gratification. This the spirit of faith cannot and will not bear, but  applies itself with cheerfulness and zeal to keep it down and restrain  it, as Paul says, \"I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but  I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and  bringing me into captivity to the law of sin\" (Rom. vii. 22, 23), and  again, \"I keep under my body, and bring it unto subjection, lest that  by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a  castaway\" (1 Cor. ix. 27), and \"They that are Christ's have crucified  the flesh, with the affections and lusts\" (Gal. v. 24).    These works, however, must not be done with any notion that by them a  man can be justified before God--for faith, which alone is righteousness  before God, will not bear with this false notion--but solely with this  purpose: that the body may be brought into subjection, and be purified  from its evil lusts, so that our eyes may be turned only to purging away  those lusts. For when the soul has been cleansed by faith and made to  love God, it would have all things to be cleansed in like manner, and  especially its own body, so that all things might unite with it in the  love and praise of God. Thus it comes that, from the requirements of his  own body, a man cannot take his ease, but is compelled on its account  to do many good works, that he may bring it into subjection. Yet these  works are not the means of his justification before God; he does them  out of disinterested love to the service of God; looking to no other  end than to do what is well-pleasing to Him whom he desires to obey most  dutifully in all things.    On this principle every man may easily instruct himself in what measure,  and with what distinctions, he ought to chasten his own body. He will  fast, watch, and labour, just as much as he sees to suffice for keeping  down the wantonness and concupiscence of the body. But those who pretend  to be"]]]
