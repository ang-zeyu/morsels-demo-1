To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"whole tenor of Ptolemy's life would  seem to disprove the charge, we cannot but fear that he was in part  led to this deed because he looked upon Cleomenes as the friend of  Perdiccas, or because he could not trust him in his plans for making  himself king of Egypt.    From the very commencement of his government, Ptolemy prepared for the  war which he knew must follow a declaration of his designs. Perhaps  better than any other general of Alexander, he knew how to win the  favour of the people under his rule. The condition of the country  quickly improved under his mild administration. The growing seaport of  Alexandria was a good market for a country rich in natural produce, and,  above all, Egypt's marvellously good geographical position stood her  in good stead in time of war. Surrounded nearly on all sides by desert  land, the few inhabitants, roving Bedouins, offered no danger. The land  of the Nile was accessible to an enemy in one direction only, along the  coast of Syria. This even teemed with difficulties. Transports there  could only be managed with the greatest ingenuity, and, in case of  defeat, retreat was almost impossible. On the other hand, the Egyptian  army, helped by all the advantages of a land irrigated on the canal  system, and which could be flooded at will, had only to act on the  defensive to be certain of victory. The country is perhaps more open to  an attack from the sea, but, by a moderately well-conducted defensive  movement, the enemy could be kept to the coast. Even the landing there  is scarcely possible, on account of the natural difficulties at the  mouth of the Nile. The one easy spot--Alexandria--was so well fortified  that an invader had but little chance of success.    About the time of Alexander's death (and to some extent brought about by  this event), civil war broke out in Cyrenaica, in consequence of which  the followers of one party were forced out of the town of Cyrene. These  joined themselves with the exiles of the town of Barca, and together  sought help of foreigners. They placed themselves under the leadership  of the Spartan Thibron, formerly Alexander's chancellor of the  exchequer. Begged by the exiled Cyrenians to help them, he now directed  his forces against Libya, fought a fierce battle, and took possession  of the harbour of Apollonia, two miles distant from the town. He then  besieged the town of Cyrene, and forced the Cyrenians at last to sue for  peace. They were obliged to make a payment of five hundred talents and  to take back the exiles. Messengers were sent by Thibron to incite  the other towns in Cyrenaica to join him and to help him conquer their  neighbour, Libya. Thibron's followers were allowed to plunder, and this  led to quarrels, desertions, treacherous acts, and the recruiting of his  army from the Peloponnesus. After varying fortunes of war, in the  spring of 322 B. C., some of the Cyrenians fled to Egypt, and related to  Ptolemy what had occurred in Cyrenaica, begging him to help them back  to their homes. The suggestion was welcome to him, for victory would be  easy over these struggling factions. He sent a strong military and naval  force, under Ophelas, the Macedonian, to Cyrenaica in the summer. When  these were seen approaching, those exiles who had found refuge with  Thibron decided to join them. Their plan, however, was discovered, and  they were put to death. The leader of the rabble in Cyrene (fearful  for his own safety, now that the exiles who had fled to Egypt were  returning) made overtures of peace to Thibron, and joined with him to  repulse Ophelas. The latter worked with the utmost caution, sent an army  under Epicides of Olynth against Tancheira, whilst he himself marched  against Cyrene.    [Illustration: 036.jpg THE DOM PALM.]    He met Thibron in a fierce fight. The latter was completely defeated and  fled towards Tancheira, where he hoped to find help, but instead fell  into Epicides' hands. Thibron was given over to the people of Tancheira  for punishment. He was cruelly scourged, and then dragged to Apollonia,  where he was crucified. Ophelas, however, was not able to conquer the  Cyrenians until Ptolemy himself arrived with fresh troops, overpowered  the town and joined the province to his own satrapy.    The conquest of this Greek province was a gain equally for himself and  for the Greeks. He put an end to the horrible anarchy that prevailed  there, and proved himself their saviour as well as their conqueror. His  name was now an honoured one among all the Greeks. When it was rumoured  that war was likely to break out between Ptolemy and the royal party,  the Macedonians flocked to Alexandria, \"every man ready to give all and  to sacrifice himself in order to help his friend.\" A popular belief of  the day was that, although Ptolemy was known as the son of Lagos, he was  in reality the son of Philip, and indeed much in his manner resembled  the great founder of the Macedonian power. Amongst the successors of  Alexander, not one understood as well as he how to retain and increase  the power which he had won. He recognised, also, from the first, the  tendency of the age: the tendency to split up the kingdom into different  states; and he had made this the basis of his policy. It was under him  that the first state (in the new sense of the word) was founded. He was  the leader of the new movement that soon generated disunity, and to  this end he made a secret contract with Antipatros against the regent  Perdiccas. About this time also misunderstandings between the regent and  the rulers in the West began to take a serious aspect.    At a great meeting in Babylon in the summer of the year 323, it was  decided that the body of Alexander was to be taken with great solemnity  to the Temple of Amon, and that the equipping and guidance of the  funeral procession should be entrusted to Arridaeus. At the end of the  year 323, the necessary preparations were finished. The gigantic  funeral car that was to carry the kingly bier had been decorated with  unparalleled magnificence. Without waiting for orders from the regent,  Arridaeus started with the funeral procession from Babylon. Crowds from  far and near filled the streets, some curious to see the magnificent  sight, others eager to show this last token of respect to the dead king.  It was firmly believed amongst the Macedonians that the country in  which Alexander's body had its last resting-place would become happy and  powerful above all countries. This prophecy was uttered by the old seer  Telmissus soon after the king's death. Did Ptolemy have this belief, or  did he wish to make use of it? There were probably other reasons which  had caused him to enter into an understanding with Arridaeus, and to  arrange with him that he was to start without orders from the regent.  He was afraid that Perdiccas, in order to add to the solemnity of the  procession, would himself accompany the body with the imperial army to  Egypt. Ptolemy felt that his position in the lands entrusted to his  care would be greatly weakened if a higher authority than himself could  appear there with a military force. Arridaeus led the funeral train to  Damascus, as had been arranged before with Ptolemy. It was in vain that  Pole-mon (one of Perdiccas' generals), who was in the neighbourhood,  went to meet him. He was able to obtain no aspect for the express order  of the regent. The funeral procession passed Damascus on its way to  Egypt. Ptolemy accompanied the body with his army as far as Syria. It  was then taken on to Memphis to rest there until it could be sheltered  by that beautiful sepulchre of the kings at Alexandria.    Arridaeus' action, in starting without permission, and the defiance of  Polemon's order, were acts of open revolt against the higher authority  of the kingdom. Perdiccas called all loyal followers to the council  of war. Ptolemy, he said, had defied the order of the kings in his  behaviour concerning the funeral procession; and he had also given  shelter to the exiled satraps of Phrygia. He was prepared for war, which  he hoped to bring about. It was for them (the loyal ones) to uphold  the dignity of the kingdom. They must try to take him unawares, and to  overcome them individually. The question was, if the Egyptians or the  Macedonians ought to be first attacked. In the end, plans were carefully  concerted for an attack on Egypt and the protection of Europe. In the  early spring of B.C. 321, Perdiccas and his colleagues set out for  Egypt with the imperial army, ordering the fleet to follow, and leaving  Eumenes with skilled officers and troops in general command of Asia  Minor for the purpose of guarding the Hellespont.    At the Egyptian frontier, Perdiccas summoned the army together, that the  men themselves should give judgment in the case of the satrap of Egypt,  in the same way as in the preceding autumn they had given judgment in  the case of Antigones. He expected a decision which would enable him  to finish what he had already begun. The accusations were that he had  refused obedience to the kings, that he had fought against and overcome  the Greeks of Cyrenaica (who had received freedom from Alexander),  and that he had taken possession of the king's body, and carried it to  Memphis.    According to the single account, which tells us of these proceedings,  Ptolemy himself appeared to conduct his own defence before the assembled  warriors. He had good reason for reckoning on the impression his  confidence in them would make upon them, and on the love that he knew  the Macedonians bore towards him. He knew, too, of the increasing  dislike of the imperial regent. His defence was heard with growing  approval, and the army's judgment was \"freedom.\"    In spite of this the regent kept to the war. The decision of the troops  alienated him still more from them. The war with Egypt was contrary to  their wishes, and they murmured openly.

To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"Alexandria; being also of a great age, he  well deserved the honour of being sent on the embassy to Caligula. He  was in religion a Jew, in his philosophy a platonist, and by birth an  Egyptian: and in his numerous writings we may trace the three sources  from which he drew his opinions. He is always devotional and in earnest,  full of pure and lofty thoughts, and often eloquent. His fondness for  the mystical properties of numbers, and for finding an allegory or  secondary meaning in the plainest narrative, seems borrowed from the  Egyptians. According to the Eastern proverb every word in a wise book  has seventy-two meanings; and this mode of interpretation was called  into use by the necessity which the Jews felt of making the Old  Testament speak a meaning more agreeable to their modern views of  religion. In Philo's speculative theology he seems to have borrowed less  from Moses than from the abstractions of Plato, whose shadowy hints he  has embodied in a more solid form. He was the first Jewish writer  that applied to the Deity the mystical notion of the Egyptians, that  everything perfect was of three parts. Philo's writings are valuable as  showing the steps by which the philosophy of Greece may be traced  from the writings of Plato to those of Justin Martyr and Clemens  Alexandrinus. They give us the earliest example of how the mystical  interpretation of the Scriptures was formed into a system, by which  every text was made to unfold some important philosophic or religious  truth to the learned student, at the same time that to the unlearned  reader it conveyed only the simple historic fact.    The Hellenistic Jews, while suffering under severe political  disabilities, had taken up a high literary position in Alexandria, and  had forced their opinions into the notice of the Greeks. The glowing  earnestness of their philosophy, now put forward in a platonic dress,  and heir improved style, approaching even classic elegance, laced their  writings on a lofty eminence far above anything which the cold, lifeless  grammarians of the museum were then producing. Apion, who went to Rome  to plead against Philo, was a native of the Great Oasis, but as he was  born of Greek parents, he claimed and received the title and privileges  of an Alexandrian, which he denied to the Jews who were born in the  city. He had studied under Didymus and Apollonius and Euphranor, and was  one of the most laborious of the grammarians and editors of Homer. All  his writings are now lost. Some of them were attacks upon the Jews and  their religion, calling in question the truth of the Jewish history  and the justice of that nation's claim to high antiquity; and to these  attacks we owe Josephus' _Answer_, in which several valuable fragments  of history are saved by being quoted against the pagans in support of  the Old Testament. One of his works was his _AEgyptiaca_, an account of  what he thought most curious in Egypt. But his learned trifling is now  lost, and nothing remains of it but his account of the meeting between  Androclus and the lion, which took place in the amphitheatre at Rome  when Apion was there on his embassy. Androclus was a runaway slave, who,  when retaken, was brought to Rome to be thrown before an African lion  for the amusement of the citizens, and as a punishment for his flight.  But the fierce and hungry beast, instead of tearing him to pieces,  wagged his tail at him, and licked his feet. It seems that the slave,  when he fled from his master, had gained the friendship of the lion in  the Libyan desert, first by pulling a thorn out of his foot, and then  by living three years with him in a cave; and, when both were brought  in chains to Rome, Androclus found a grateful friend in the amphitheatre  where he thought to have met with a cruel death.    We may for a moment leave our history, to bid a last farewell to the  family of the Ptolemies. Augustus, after leading Selene, the daughter  of Cleopatra and Antony, through the streets of Rome in his triumph, had  given her in marriage to the younger Juba, the historian of Africa; and  about the same time he gave to the husband the kingdom of Mauritania,  the inheritance of his father. His son Ptolemy succeeded him on the  throne, but was soon turned out of his kingdom. We trace the last of  the Ptolemies in his travels through Greece and Asia Minor by the  inscriptions remaining to his honour. The citizens of Xanthus in Lycia  set up a monument to him; and at Athens his statue was placed beside  that of Philadelphus in the gymnasium of Ptolemy, near the temple of  Theseus, where he was honoured as of founder's kin. He was put to death  by Caligula. Drusilla, another grandchild of Cleopatra and Antony,  married Antonius Felix, the procurator of Judaea, after the death of his  first wife, who was also named Drusilla. These are the last notices that  we meet with of the royal family of Egypt.    As soon as the news of Caligula's death (A.D. 41) reached Egypt, the  joy of the Jews knew no bounds. They at once flew to arms to revenge  themselves on the Alexandrians, whose streets were again the seat of  civil war. The governor did what he could to quiet both parties, but  was not wholly successful till the decree of the new emperor reached  Alexandria. In this Claudius granted to the Jews the full rights of  citizenship, which they had enjoyed under the Ptolemies, and which had  been allowed by Augustus; he left them to choose their own high priest,  to enjoy their own religion without hindrance, and he repealed the laws  of Caligula under which they had been groaning. At this time the Jewish  alabarch in Egypt was Demetrius, a man of wealth and high birth, who had  married Mariamne, the daughter of the elder Agrippa.    [Illustration: 041.jpg EGYPTIAN THRESHING-MACHINE]    The government under Claudius was mild and just, at least as far as  a government could be in which every tax-gatherer, every military  governor, and every sub-prefect was supposed to enrich himself by his  appointment. Every Roman officer, from the general down to the lowest  tribune, claimed the right of travelling through the country free of  expense, and seizing the carts and cattle of the villagers to carry him  forward to the next town, under the pretence of being a courier on the  public service. But we have a decree of the ninth year of this reign,  carved on the temple in the Great Oasis, in which Cneius Capito, the  prefect of Egypt, endeavours to put a stop to this injustice. He orders  that no traveller shall have the privilege of a courier unless he has a  proper warrant, and that then he shall only claim a free lodging; that  clerks in the villages shall keep a register of all that is taken on  account of the public service; and that if anybody make an unjust claim  he shall pay four times the amount to the informer and six times the  amount to the emperor. But royal decrees could do little or nothing  where there were no judges to enforce them; and the people of Upper  Egypt must have felt this law as a cruel insult when they were told that  they might take up their complaints to Basilides, at Alexandria. The  employment of the informer is a full acknowledgment of the weakness  of this absolute government, and that the prefect had not the power  to enforce his own decrees; and, when we compare this law with that  of Alexander on his conquest of the country, we have no difficulty in  seeing why Egypt rose under the Ptolemies and sunk under the selfish  policy of Augustus.    Claudius was somewhat of a scholar and an author; he wrote several  volumes both in Greek and in Latin. The former he might perhaps think  would be chiefly valued in Alexandria; and when he founded a new college  in that city, called after himself the Claudian Museum, he ordered that  on given days every year his history of Carthage should be publicly  read in one museum, and his history of Italy in the other; thus securing  during his reign an attention to his writings which their merits alone  would not have gained.    Under the government of Claudius the Egyptians were again allowed to  coin money; and in his first year begins that historically important  series in which every coin is dated with the year of the emperor's  reign. The coins of the Ptolemies were strictly Greek in their  workmanship, and the few Egyptian characters that we see upon them are  so much altered by the classic taste of the die-engraver that we hardly  know them again. But it is far otherwise with the coins of the emperors,  which are covered with the ornaments, characters, and religious  ceremonies of the native Egyptians; and, though the style of art is  often bad, they are scarcely equalled by any series of coins whatever in  the service they render to the historian.    It was in this reign that the route through Egypt to India first became  really known to the Greeks and Romans. The historian Pliny, who died in  79 A.D., has left us a contemporary account of these early voyages. \"It  will not be amiss,\" he says in his _Natural History_, \"to set forth the  whole of the route from Egypt, which has been stated to us of late, upon  information on which reliance may be placed and is here published for  the first time. The subject is one well worthy of our notice, seeing  that in no year does India drain our empire of less than five hundred  and fifty millions of sesterces [or two million dollars], giving back  her own wares in exchange, which are sold among us at fully one hundred  times their cost price.    \"Two miles distant from Alexandria is the town of Heliopolis. The  distance thence to Koptos, up the Nile, is three hundred and eight  miles; the voyage is performed, when the Etesian winds are blowing, in  twelve days. From Koptos the journey is made with the aid of camels,  stations being arranged at intervals for the supply of fresh water. The  first of these stations is called Hydreuma, and is distant twenty-two  miles; "]]]
