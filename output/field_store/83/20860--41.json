Ever your friend,    EDWIN BOOTH.        TO MISS EMMA F. CARY  [Three weeks after the assassination by his brother, John Wilkes  Booth, of President Lincoln.]  Saturday, May 6, 1865.    MY DEAR FRIEND:    I've just received your letter.  I have been in one sense unable to  write, but you know, of course, what my condition is, and need no  excuses.    I have been, by the advice of my friends, \"cooped up\" since I arrived  here, going out only occasionally in the evening.  My health is good,  but I suffer from the want of fresh air and exercise.    Poor mother is in Philadelphia, about crushed by her sorrows, and my  sister, Mrs. Clarke, is ill, and without the least knowledge of her  husband, who was taken from her several days ago, with Junius.    My position is such a delicate one that I am obliged to use the utmost  caution.  Hosts of friends are staunch and true to me.  Here and in  Boston I feel safe.  What I am in Philadelphia and elsewhere I know  not.  All I do [know] of the above named city is that there is one  great heart firm and faster bound to me than ever.    Sent in answer to dear Mary's [his wife's] prayers--I faithfully  believe it.  She will do what Mary struggled, suffered, and died in  doing.  My baby, too, is there.  Now that the greatest excitement is  over, and a lull is in the storm, I feel the need of that dear angel;  but during the heat of it I was glad she was not here.    When Junius and Mr. Clarke are at liberty, mother will come here and  bring Edwina [his daughter] to me.  I wish I could see with others'  eyes; all my friends assure me that my name shall be free, and that in  a little while I may be where I was and what I was; but, alas! it  looks dark to me.    God bless you all for your great assistance in my behalf; even dear  Dick aided me in my extremity, did he not?    Give my love to all and kisses to George.    ...  I do not think the feeling is so strong in my favour in  Philadelphia as it is here and in Boston.  I am not known there.  Ever  yours.        TO MR. NAHUM CAPEN    [In response to an inquiry regarding his brother, John Wilkes Booth.]  WINDSOR HOTEL, NEW YORK,  July 28, 1881.    DEAR SIR:    I can give you very little information regarding my brother John.  I  seldom saw him since his early boyhood in Baltimore.  He was a  rattle-pated fellow, filled with quixotic notions.    While at the farm in Maryland he would charge on horseback through the  woods, \"spouting\" heroic speeches with a lance in his hand--a relic of  the Mexican war--given to father by some soldier who had served under  Taylor.  We regarded him as a good-hearted, harmless, though  wild-brained, boy, and used to laugh at his patriotic froth whenever  secession was discussed.  That he was insane on that one point no one  who knew him well can doubt.  When I told him that I had voted for  Lincoln's reelection he expressed deep regret, and declared his belief  that Lincoln would be made king of America; and this I believe, drove  him beyond the limits of reason.  I asked him once why he did not join  the Confederate army.  To which he replied, \"I promised mother I would  keep out of the quarrel, if possible, and I am sorry that I said so.\"  Knowing my sentiments, he avoided me, rarely visiting my house, except  to see his mother, when political topics were not touched upon--at  least in my presence.  He was of a gentle, loving disposition, very  boyish and full of fun--his mother's darling--and his deed and death  crushed her spirit.  He possessed rare dramatic talent, and would have  made a brilliant mark in the theatrical world.  This is positively all  that I know about him, having left him a mere school-boy, when I went  with my father to California in 1852.  On my return in 1856 we were  separated by professional engagements, which kept him mostly in the  South while I was employed in the Eastern and Northern states.    I do not believe any of the wild, romantic stories published in the  papers concerning him; but of course he may have been engaged in  political matters of which I know nothing.  All his theatrical friends  speak of him as a poor crazy boy, and such his family think of him.  I  am sorry I can afford you no further light on the subject.  Very truly  yours,        ADVICE TO A YOUNG ACTOR    [TO WALTER THOMAS]  NEW YORK, August 28, 1889.    MY DEAR MR. THOMAS:    I was surprised to learn that your engagement with Mr. Barrett is  terminated, and am sorry for the cause, although I believe the result  will be to your advantage.  Your chances for promotion will be better  in a company that is not confined to so limited a repertoire as mine,  in which so few opportunities occur for the proper exercise of  youthful talent.  A frequent change of role, and of the lighter  sort--especially such as one does not like forcing one's self to use  the very utmost of his ability in the performance of--is the training  requisite for a mastery of the actor's art.    I had seven years' apprenticeship at it, during which most of my  labour was in the field of comedy--\"walking gentleman,\" burlesque, and  low comedy parts--the while my soul was yearning for high tragedy.  I  did my best with all that I was cast for, however, and the unpleasant  experience did me a world of good.  Had I followed my own bent, I  would have been, long ago, a \"crushed tragedian.\"    I will, as you request, give you a line to Mr. Palmer, and I hope you  may obtain a position that will afford you the necessary practice.  With best wishes.  Truly yours,    EDWIN BOOTH.        CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN        [Charlotte Cushman, a native of Boston, died in that city in 1876.  No  actress ever excelled her as Meg Merrilies, Queen Katherine, and Lady  Macbeth.  On the morning following her death, Mr. William Winter wrote  in the New York _Tribune_:--    ...  Charlotte Cushman was not a great actress merely, but she was a  great woman.  She did not possess the dramatic faculty apart from  other faculties and conquer by that alone: but having that faculty in  almost unlimited fulness, she poured forth through its channel such  resources of character, intellect, moral strength, soul, and personal  magnetism as marked her for a genius of the first order, while they  made her an irresistible force in art.  When she came upon the stage  she filled it with the brilliant vitality of her presence.  Every  movement that she made was winningly characteristic.  Her least  gesture was eloquence, Her voice, which was soft or silvery, or deep  or mellow, according as emotion affected it, used now and then to  tremble, and partly to break, with tones that were pathetic beyond  description.  These were denotements of the fiery soul that smouldered  beneath her grave exterior, and gave iridescence to every form of art  that she embodied.  Sometimes her whole being seemed to become  petrified in a silent suspense more thrilling than any action, as if  her imagination were suddenly inthralled by the tumult and awe of its  own vast perceptions.\"    Her frlend, Emma Stebbins, the sculptor, edited a memorial volume,  \"Charlotte Cushman:  Her Letters and Memories of Her Life,\" published  in 1878.  By permission of the publishers and owners of the copyright,  Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston, the pages that follow are  offered.--ED.]        AS A CHILD A MIMIC AND SINGER    On one occasion [wrote Miss Cushman] when Henry Ware, pastor of the  old Boston Meeting House, was taking tea with my mother, he sat at  table talking, with his chin resting in his two hands, and his elbows  on the table.  I was suddenly startled by my mother exclaiming,  \"Charlotte, take your elbows off the table and your chin out of your  hands; it is not a pretty position for a young lady!\"  I was sitting  in exact imitation of the parson, even assuming the expression of his  face.    Besides singing everything, I exercised my imitative powers in all  directions, and often found myself instinctively mimicking the tones,  movement, and expression of those about me.  I'm afraid I was what the  French call _un enfant terrible_--in the vernacular, an awful child!  full of irresistible life and impulsive will; living fully in the  present, looking neither before nor after; as ready to execute as to  conceive; full of imagination--a faculty too often thwarted and warped  by the fears of parents and friends that it means insincerity and  falsehood, when it is in reality but the spontaneous exercise of  faculties as yet unknown even to the possessor, and misunderstood by  those so-called trainers of infancy.    This imitative faculty in especial I inherited from my grandmother  Babbit, born Mary Saunders, of Gloucester, Cape Ann.  Her faculty of  imitation was very remarkable.  I remember sitting at her feet on a  little stool and hearing her sing a song of the period, in which she  delighted me by the most perfect imitation of every creature belonging  to the farmyard.        FIRST VISITS TO THE THEATRE    My uncle, Augustus Babbit, who led a seafaring life and was lost at  sea, took great interest in me; he offered me prizes for proficiency  in my studies, especially music and writing.  He first took me to the  theatre on one of his return voyages, which was always a holiday time  for me.  My first play was \"Coriolanus,\" with Macready, and my second  \"The Gamester,\" with Cooper and Mrs. Powell as Mr. and Mrs. Beverley.  All the English actors and actresses of that time were of the Siddons  and Kemble school, and I cannot but think these early impressions must  have been powerful toward the formation of a style of acting afterward  slowly eliminated through the various stages of my artistic career.    My uncle had great taste and love for the dramatic profession, and  became acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. William"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#6)"],[1,"many are sick.    _16th August, 1869._--West and by north through much forest reach  Kalalibebe; buffalo killed.    _17th August, 1869._--To a high mountain, Golu or Gulu, and sleep at its  base.    _18th August, 1869._--Cross two rills flowing into River Mgoluye. Kagoya  and Moishe flow into Lobumba.    _19th August, 1869._--To the River Lobumba, forty-five yards Avide,  thigh deep, and rapid current. Logumba and Lobumba are both from Kabogo  Mounts: one goes into Tanganyika, and the other, or Lobumba, into and is  the Luamo: prawns are found in this river. The country east of the  Lobumba is called Lobanda, that west of it, Kitwa.    _21st August, 1869._--Went on to the River Loungwa, which has worn for  itself a rut in new red sandstone twenty feet deep, and only three or  four feet wide at the lips.    _25th August, 1869._--We rest because all are tired; travelling at this  season is excessively fatiguing. It is very hot at even 10 A.M., and 21/2  or 3 hours tires the strongest--carriers especially so: during the rains  five hours would not have fatigued so much as three do now. We are now  on the same level as Tanganyika. The dense mass of black smoke rising  from the burning grass and reeds on the Lobumba, or Robumba, obscures  the sun, and very sensibly lowers the temperature of the sultriest day;  it looks like the smoke in Martin's pictures. The Manyuema arrows here  are very small, and made of strong grass stalks, but poisoned, the large  ones, for elephants and buffaloes, are poisoned also.    _31st August, 1869._--Course N.W. among Palmyras and Hyphene Palms, and  many villages swarming with people. Crossed Kibila, a hot fountain about  120 deg., to sleep at Kolokolo River, five yards wide, and knee deep: midway  we passed the River Kanzazala. On asking the name of a mountain on our  right I got three names for it--Kaloba, Chingedi, and Kihomba, a fair  specimen of the superabundance of names in this country!    _1st September, 1869._--West in flat forest, then cross Kishila River,  and go on to Kunde's villages. The Katamba is a fine rivulet. Kunde is  an old man without dignity or honour: he came to beg, but offered  nothing.    _2nd September, 1869._--We remained at Katamba to hunt buffaloes and  rest, as I am still weak. A young elephant was killed, and I got the  heart: the Arabs do not eat it, but that part is nice if well cooked.    A Lunda slave, for whom I interceded to be freed of the yoke, ran away,  and as he is near the Barna, his countrymen, he will be hidden. He told  his plan to our guide, and asked to accompany him back to Tanganyika,  but he is eager to deliver him up for a reward: all are eager to press  each other down in the mire into which they are already sunk.    _5th September, 1869._--Kunde's people refused the tusks of an elephant  killed by our hunter, asserting that they had killed it themselves with  a hoe: they have no honour here, as some have elsewhere.    _7th September, 1869._--W. and N.W., through forest and immense fields  of cassava, some three years old, with roots as thick as a stout man's  leg.    _8th September, 1869._--Across five rivers and through many villages.  The country is covered with ferns and gingers, and miles and miles of  cassava. On to village of Karun-gamagao.    _9th September, 1869._--Rest again to shoot meat, as elephants and  buffaloes are very abundant: the Suaheli think that adultery is an  obstacle to success in killing this animal: no harm can happen to him  who is faithful to his wife, and has the proper charms inserted under  the skin of his forearms.    _10th September, 1869._--North and north-west, over four rivers, and.  past the village of Makala, to near that of Pyana-mosinde.    _12th September, 1869._--We had wandered, and now came back to our path  on hilly ground. The days are sultry and smoking. We came to some  villages of Pyana-mosinde; the population prodigiously large. A sword  was left at the camp, and at once picked up; though the man was traced  to a village it was refused, till he accidentally cut his foot with it,  and became afraid that worse would follow, elsewhere it would have been  given up at once: Pyana-mosinde came out and talked very sensibly.    _13th September, 1869._--Along towards the Moloni or Mononi; cross seven  rills. The people seized three slaves who lagged behind, but hearing a  gun fired at guinea-fowls let them go. Route N.    _14th September, 1869._--Up and down hills perpetually. We went down  into some deep dells, filled with gigantic trees, and I measured one  twenty feet in circumference, and sixty or seventy feet high to the  first branches; others seemed fit to be ship's spars. Large lichens  covered many and numerous new plants appeared on the ground.    _15th September, 1869._--Got clear of the mountains after 1-1/2 hour, and  then the vast valley of Mamba opened out before us; very beautiful, and  much of it cleared of trees. Met Dugumbe carrying 18,000 lbs. of ivory,  purchased in this new field very cheaply, because no traders had ever  gone into the country beyond Bambarre, or Moenekuss's district before.  We were now in the large bend of the Lualaba, which is here much larger  than at Mpweto's, near Moero Lake. River Kesingwe.    _16th September, 1869._--To Kasangangazi's. We now came to the first  palm-oil trees (_Elais Guineensis_) in our way since we left Tanganyika.  They had evidently been planted at villages. Light-grey parrots, with  red tails, also became common, whose name, Kuss or Koos, gives the chief  his name, Moenekuss (\"Lord of the Parrot\"); but the Manyuema  pronunciation is Monanjoose. Much reedy grass, fully half an inch in  diameter in the stalk on our route, and over the top of the range  Moloni, which we ascended: the valleys are impassable.    _17th September, 1869._--Remain to buy food at Kasanga's, and rest the  carriers. The country is full of pahn-oil palms, and very beautiful. Our  people are all afraid to go out of sight of the camp for necessary  purposes, lest the Manyuema should kill them. Here was the barrier to  traders going north, for the very people among whom we now are, murdered  anyone carrying a tusk, till last year, when Moene-mokaia, or Katomba,  got into friendship with Moenekuss, who protected his people, and always  behaved in a generous sensible manner. Dilongo, now a chief here, came  to visit us: his elder brother died, and he was elected; he does not  wash in consequence, and is very dirty.    Two buffaloes were killed yesterday. The people have their bodies  tattooed with new and full moons, stars, crocodiles, and Egyptian  gardens.    _19th September, 1869._--We crossed several rivulets three yards to  twelve yards, and calf deep. The mountain where we camped is called  Sangomelambe.    _20th September, 1869._--Up to a broad range of high mountains of light  grey granite; there are deep dells on the top filled with gigantic  trees, and having running rills in them. Some trees appear with enormous  roots, buttresses in fact like mangroves in the coast swamps, six feet  high at the trunk and flattened from side to side to about three inches  in diameter. There are many villages dotted over the slopes which we  climbed; one had been destroyed, and revealed the hard clay walls and  square forms of Manyuema houses. Our path lay partly along a ridge, with  a deep valley on each side: one on the left had a valley filled with  primeval forests, into which elephants when wounded escape completely.  The forest was a dense mass, without a bit of ground to be seen except a  patch on the S.W., the bottom of this great valley was 2000 feet below  us, then ranges of mountains with villages on their bases rose as far as  they could reach. On our right there was another deep but narrow gorge,  and mountains much higher than on our ridge close adjacent. Our ridge  looked like a glacier, and it wound from side to side, and took us to  the edge of deep precipices, first on the right, then on the left, till  down below we came to the villages of Chief Monandenda. The houses here  are all well filled with firewood on shelves, and each has a bed on a  raised platform in an inner room.    The paths are very skilfully placed on the tops of the ridges of hills,  and all gullies are avoided. If the highest level were not in general  made the ground for passing through the country the distances would at  least be doubled, and the fatigue greatly increased. The paths seem to  have been used for ages: they are worn deep on the heights; and in  hollows a little mound rises on each side, formed by the feet tossing a  little soil on one side.    _21st September, 1869._--Cross five or six rivulets, and as many  villages, some burned and deserted, or inhabited. Very many people come  running to see the strangers. Gigantic trees all about the villages.  Arrive at Bambarre or Moenekuss.    About eighty hours of actual travelling, say at 2' per hour = say 160'  or 140'. Westing from 3rd August to 21st September. My strength  increased as I persevered. From Tanganyika west bank say =        29 deg. 30' east - 140' = 2 deg. 20,'       2  20      -------      27 deg. 10' Long.    Chief village of Moenekuss.    Observations show a little lower altitude than Tanganyika.    _22nd September, 1869._--Moenekuss died lately, and left his two sons to  fill his place. Moenembagg is the elder of the two, and the most  sensible, and the spokesman on all important occasions, but his younger  brother, Moenemgoi, is the chief, the centre of authority. They showed  symptoms of suspicion, and Mohamad performed the ceremony of mixing  blood, which is simply making a small incision on the forearm of each  person, and then mixing the bloods, and making declarations of  friendship. Moenembagg said, \"Your people must not steal, we never do,\"  which is true: blood in a small quantity was then conveyed from one to  the other by a fig-leaf. \"No stealing of fowls or of men,\" said the"]]]
