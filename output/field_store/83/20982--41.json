So Peter continued his journey, stopping every once in a while to look  back at the strange old man, who was slowly climbing the hill. At length  Peter came to a little quiet grove of pines, and there he sat down on a  big stone and ate the luncheon which his mother had prepared for him.  The sun was high in the heavens; it was close on to high noon. Now, as  Peter was contentedly munching his bread and cheese, he heard, at first  far away, then quite near at hand, the clear notes of a coachman's horn.  The notes of the second call died away in a great pattering of hoofs and  tinkling of little bells, and suddenly, arriving in a great swirl of  yellow dust, came a magnificent coach drawn by twelve white horses. A  lady, very richly dressed and wearing many sparkling diamonds, sat  within the coach. To Peter's astonishment, the lady was his Aunt Jane.    The coach stopped with a great jingling of the twelve harnesses, and  Aunt Jane leaned out of the window, and said to Peter, \"What are you  doing here, child?\"    \"I was on my way to your cottage with a basket of fine fresh eggs,\"  answered Peter.    \"Well, it's fortunate I found you,\" said Aunt Jane, \"for I have given up  living in the cottage, and have now got a castle of my own. Jump in,  Peter, and don't forget your basket.\"    So Peter climbed into the coach, closed the door behind him, and was  driven away. The coach went over hill and down dale; it went through  strange forests from whose branches green parrots whooped and shrieked;  it rolled through valleys in strange shining mountains. Peter stole a  look at Aunt Jane and saw that she was wearing a crown.    \"Are you a queen, Aunt Jane?\" he asked.    \"Indeed, I am,\" replied his aunt. \"You see, Peter, two days ago, while I  was looking for my white cow who had strayed away, I came upon the  magnificent castle to which we are now going. It has four beautiful  towers, and a door set with diamonds.    \"'Whose castle is this?' I said to the lodge-keeper.    \"'It's nobody's, marm,' said he.    \"'What,' said I; 'do you mean to say that nobody owns this fine castle?'    \"'That's just what I mean to say, marm,' answered he; 'the castle  belongs to anyone who wants it.'    \"So into the castle I walked, and I did n't go out, you may be sure,  till I had been into every room that I could find. Then I put on these  clothes and these diamonds, which I found in a cupboard, and went down  and told the servants I intended to be queen. You see, Peter dear,  there's nothing that a woman of determination and energy can't  accomplish.\"    The coach rolled on, and soon Peter caught sight of Aunt Jane's castle.  It was rather large, and had an enormous round tower at each corner--a  thing which brought to Peter's mind the picture of an elephant lying on  its back. Peter and Aunt Jane, accompanied by a train of servants  dressed in blue-and-buff livery, walked into the castle through the  diamond-studded door.    \"Do you think you could eat a little more of something?\" said Aunt Jane,  taking off her white-kid gloves; \"because if you can I'll have a place  set for you at the luncheon table.\"    And Peter, who like all boys, could eat a little more anywhere and at  any time, readily answered, \"Yes.\"    So Peter and Aunt Jane sat down to a wonderful little table covered with  a snow-white cloth.    \"Draw your chair nearer, Peter dear,\" said Aunt Jane.    \"I can't\" said Peter, \"it's stuck to the floor.\"    And so it was; the chair was stuck to the floor, and no amount of  pushing or pulling could budge it.    \"That's odd,\" said Aunt Jane; \"but never mind, I'll push the table over  to the chair.\"    But like the chair, the table refused to budge. Peter then tried to  slide his plate of soup closer to him, but the plate, which the servant  had placed on the cloth but an instant before, had evidently frozen to  the table in some extraordinary manner and could not be moved an inch.  The soup in the plate, however, was not fastened to the dish, nor were  the wonderful strawberry-cakes and the delicious ices with which the  dinner closed.    \"You don't suppose this castle is enchanted, do you, Aunt Jane?\" asked  Peter.    \"Not a bit of it,\" replied Aunt Jane. \"And even if it were,\" she  continued recklessly, \"I should n't mind, for there's nothing that a  woman of determination and energy can't accomplish.\" There was a pause,  and then Aunt Jane added, \"I am going to have some guests to dinner this  evening, so run round and amuse yourself as well as you can. There's  ever so much to see in the castle, and in the garden there's a pond with  swans in it.\"    Attended by her servants, Aunt Jane majestically walked away. Peter  spent the afternoon exploring the castle. He went through room after  room; he scurried through the attics like a mouse, and was even lost for  a while in the cellars. And everywhere he went, he found everything  immovable. The beds, tables, and chairs could neither be moved about nor  lifted up, and even the clocks and vases were mysteriously fastened to  their places on the shelves.    The night came on. Coach after coach rolled up to the diamond door,  which sparkled in the moonlight. When the guests had all arrived, a  silver trumpet sounded, and Aunt Jane, dressed in a wonderful gown of  flowering brocade edged with pearls, came solemnly down the great  stairway of the castle hall. Two little black boys, dressed in oriental  costume and wearing turbans, held up her gorgeous train, and she looked  very grand indeed. Peter, to his great surprise, found himself dressed  in a wonderful suit of plum-colored velvet.    \"Welcome, my friends,\" said Queen Jane, who had opened a wonderful  ostrich-feather fan. \"Are we not fortunate in having so beautiful a  night for our dinner?\"    And the Queen, giving her arm to a splendid personage in the uniform of  an officer of the King's dragoons, led the way to the banquet-hall.    The wonderful party, all silks and satins, and gleaming with jewels,  swept like a peacock's tail behind her. Soon dinner was over, and the  guests began to stray by twos and threes to the ballroom. Aunt Jane and  the soldier led off the grand march; then came wonderful, stately  minuets, quadrilles, and sweet old-fashioned waltzes. The merriment was  at its height when somebody ran heavily up the great stairs leading to  the ballroom, and the guests, turning round to see whence came the  clatter, saw standing in the doorway a strange old man dressed in a robe  of cherry scarlet and wearing golden shoes. It was the seller of dreams.  His white hair was disheveled, his robe was awry, and there was dust on  his golden shoes.    \"Foolish people!\" screamed the old seller of dreams, his voice rising to  a shriek, \"Run your lives! This castle lies under a terrible  enchantment; in a few minutes it will turn upside-down. Have you not  seen that everything is fastened to the floor? Run for your lives!\"    Immediately there was a great babble of voices, some shrieks, and more  confusion, and the guests ran pell-mell down the great stairs and out  the castle door. To Peter's dismay, Aunt Jane was not among them. So  into the castle he rushed again, calling at the top of his voice, \"Aunt  Jane! Aunt Jane!\" He ran through the brilliantly lit and deserted  ballroom; he saw himself running in the great mirrors of the gallery.  \"Aunt Jane!\" he cried; but no Aunt Jane replied.    Peter rushed up the stairs leading to the castle tower, and emerged upon  the balcony. He saw the black shadow of the castle thrown upon the grass  far below by the full moon; he saw the great forest, so bright above and  so dark and mysterious below, and the long snow-clad range of the  Adamant Mountains. Suddenly a voice, louder than the voice of any human  being, a voice deep, ringing, and solemn as the sound of a great bell,  cried,--    \"'T is time!\"    Immediately everything became as black as ink, people shrieked, the  enchanted castle rolled like a ship at sea, and leaning far to one side,  began to turn upside-down. Peter felt the floor of the balcony tip  beneath him; he tried to catch hold of something, but could find  nothing; suddenly, with a scream, he fell. He was falling, falling,  falling, falling, falling.      When Peter came to himself, instead of its being night, it was still  noonday, and he was sitting on the same stone in the same quiet roadside  grove from which he had caught sight of his Aunt Jane in her wonderful  coach. A blue jay screamed at him from overhead. For Aunt Jane, the  coach, and the enchanted castle had been only a dream. Peter, you see,  had fallen asleep under the pines, and while he slept, he had dreamed  the dream he purchased from the seller of dreams.    Very glad to be still alive, Peter rubbed his eyes, took up his basket  of eggs, and went down the road whistling.      [Illustration: Old man and boy in the forest.]    \"How much does a dream cost?\" asked Peter.    \"A golden florin,\" answered the Seller of Dreams               THE TREASURE CASTLE    [Illustration: Three men in a flying castle tower.]      Once upon a time a hunter was roaming through the wildwood when he heard  a voice crying piteously for aid. Following the sound, the hunter  plunged ahead, and discovered a dwarf caught in a pit which had been dug  to trap wild animals.    After the hunter had rescued the dwarf from his prison, the little man  said to him: \"Go ten leagues to the north till you arrive at a gigantic  pine; then turn to the east, and go ten leagues more till you come to a  black castle. Enter the castle without fear, and you will discover a  round room in which stands a round ebony table laden with gold and  jewels. Help yourself to the treasure, and return home at once. And do  not--now mark me well--go up into the turret of the castle; for if you  do, evil will come of it.\"    So the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#6)"],[1,"eggs, etc. They are generally accompanied by their wives or daughters,  who ride like the men, but with the knees tucked up higher. On the  slippery tracks which traverse this western slope, bulls are often used  as beasts of burden, the cloven hoofs enabling them to descend with  great security. But mules are better than horses or asses. \"That a  hybrid (muses Darwin) should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy,  social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life than  either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone  nature.\"    Toward evening the ascent became rapid and the road horrible beyond  conception, growing narrower and rougher as we advanced. Indeed, our way  had long since ceased to be a road. In the dense forest, where sunshine  never comes, rocks, mud, and fallen trees in rapid alternation  macadamize the path, save where it turns up the bed of a babbling brook.  In the comparatively level tracts, the equable step of the beasts has  worn the soil into deep transverse ridges, called _camellones_, from  their resemblance to the humps on a camel's back. In the precipitous  parts the road is only a gully worn by the transit of men and beasts for  ages, aided by torrents of water in the rainy season. As we ascend, this  changes to a rocky staircase, so strait that one must throw up his legs  to save them from being crushed, and so steep that horse and rider run  the risk of turning a somersault. It is fearful to meet in a narrow  defile, or where the road winds around the edge of a precipice, a drove  of reckless donkeys and mules descending the mountain, urged on by the  cries and lashes of the muleteers behind. Yet this has been the highway  of Ecuadorian commerce for three hundred years. In vain we tried to  reach the little village of Camino Real on the crest of the ridge; but  the night was advancing rapidly, and crawling up such a road by  starlight was not a little dangerous. So we put up at a miserable tambo,  Pogyos by name. It was a mud hut of the rudest kind, windowless and  unfloored; very clean, if it had been left to nature, but man and beast  had rendered it intolerably filthy. Our hostess, a Quichua woman, with  tattered garments, and hair disheveled and standing up as if  electrified, set a kettle on three stones, and, making a fire under it,  prepared for us a calabash of chicken and _locro_. _Locro_, the national  dish in the mountains, is in plain English simply potato soup. Sitting  on the ground, we partook of this refreshment by the aid of fingers and  wooden spoons, enticing our appetites by the reflection that potato soup  would support life. The unkempt Indian by our side, grinning in  conscious pride over her successful cookery, did not aid us in this  matter. Fire is used in Ecuador solely for culinary purposes, not for  warmth. It is made at no particular spot on the mud floor, and there is  no particular orifice for the exit of the smoke save the chinks in the  wall. There is not a chimney in the whole republic. As the spare room in  the establishment belonged to the women, we gentlemen slept on the  ground outside, or on beds made of round poles. The night was piercingly  cold. The wished-for morning came at last, and long before the sun  looked over the mountains we were on our march. It was the same terrible  road, running zigzag, or \"quingo\" fashion, up to Camino Real, where it  was suddenly converted into a royal highway.    We were now fairly out of the swamps of the lowlands, and, though under  the equator, out of the tropics too. The fresh mountain breeze and the  chilly mists announced a change of climate.[12] Fevers and dysenteries,  snakes and musquitoes, the plantain and the palm, we had left behind.  Camino Real is a huddle of eight or ten dwellings perched on the summit  of a sierra a thousand feet higher than the top of Mount Washington. The  views from this stand-point compensate for all past troubles. The wild  chaos of mountains on every side, broken by profound ravines, the heaps  of ruins piled up during the lapse of geologic ages, the intense azure  of the sky, and the kingly condor majestically wheeling around the still  higher pinnacles, make up a picture rarely to be seen. Westward, the  mountains tumble down into hills and spread out into plains, which, in  the far distant horizon, dip into the great Pacific. The setting sun  turns the ocean into a sheet of liquid fire. Long columns of purple  light shoot up to the zenith, and as the last point of the sun sinks  beneath the horizon, the stars rush out in full splendor; for at the  equator day gives place to night with only an hour and twenty minutes of  twilight. The mountains are Alpine, yet grander than the Alps; not so  ragged as the granite peaks of Switzerland, but with rounder heads. The  prospect down this occidental slope is diversified by deep valleys,  lands-lides, and flowering trees. Magnificent are the views eastward,        \"Where Andes, giant of the western star,      Looks from his throne of clouds o'er half the world.\"    [Footnote 12: The altitude of 7000 feet is the usual limit of the  rain-line on the west slope of the Andes. The condensation which  produces rain takes place at the equator two or three times higher than  in our latitude.]    The majestic dome of Chimborazo was entirely uncovered of clouds, and  presented a most splendid spectacle. There it stood, its snow-white  summit, unsullied by the foot of man, towering up twice as high as Etna.  For many years it received the homage of the world as the highest point  in America; but now the Aconcagua of Chile claims the palm. Still, what  a panorama from the top of Chimborazo, could one reach it, for the eye  would command ten thousand square miles!    Our road gently winds down the sierra, giving us at every turn sublime  ideas of what nature can do in tossing up the thin crust of our globe.  But sublimity is at a discount here--there is too much of it. Suddenly  we are looking down into the enchanting valley of Chimbo. This romantic  and secluded spot is one of those forgotten corners of the earth which,  barricaded against the march of civilization by almost impassable  mountains, and inhabited by a thriftless race, has been left far behind  in the progress of mankind. Distance lends enchantment to the view. We  are reminded of the pastoral vales of New England. Wheat takes the place  of the sugar-cane, barley of cacao, potatoes of plantains, and turnips  of oranges. Bamboo sheds have given way to neatly whitewashed villages,  and the fields are fenced with rows of aloe. But, drawing nearer, we  find the habitations are in reality miserable mud hovels, without  windows, and tenanted by vermin and ragged poverty. There are herds of  cattle and fields of grain; yet we shall not find a quart of milk or a  loaf of bread for sale. The descent into the valley is very precipitous,  and, after a rain, alarmingly slippery. Mules, drawing their legs  together, slide down with startling velocity, and follow the windings  with marvelous dexterity.    We arrived at Guaranda at 5 P.M. on the third day after leaving Bodegas.  This is a desolate town of two thousand souls, dwelling in low  dilapidated huts made of the most common building material in the  Andes--_adobe_, or sun-dried blocks of mud mingled with straw.[13]    [Footnote 13: From _adoub_, an Egyptian word still used by the Copts;  carried by the Moors to Spain, thence to America; and from America the  word has gone to the Sandwich Islands.]    The streets are rudely paved, and pitch to the centre, to form an  aqueduct, like the streets of old Sychar. The inhabitants are in happy  ignorance of the outside world. They pass the day without a thought of  work, standing on the Plaza, or in front of some public office, staring  vacantly into space, or gossiping. A cockfight will soonest rouse them  from their lethargy. They seem to have no purpose in life but to keep  warm under their ponchos and to eat when they are hungry. Guaranda is a  healthy locality, lying in a deep valley on the west bank of the Chimbo,  at an elevation, according to our barometer, of 8840 feet, and having a  mean temperature slightly less than that of Quito. It is a place of  importance, inasmuch as it is the resting-place before ascending or  after descending the still loftier ranges, and much more because it is  the capital of the region which yields the invaluable _cinchona_, or  Peruvian bark.[14] This tree is indigenous to the Andes, where it is  found on the western slope between the altitudes of two thousand and  nine thousand feet, the species richest in alkaloids occupying the  higher elevations, where the air is moist. Dr. Weddell enumerates  twenty-one species, seven of which are now found in Ecuador, but the  only one of value is the the _C. succirubra_ (the _calisaya_ has run  out), and this is now nearly extinct, as the trees have been destroyed  to obtain the bark. This species is a beautiful tree, having large,  broadly oval, deep green, shining leaves, white, fragrant flowers, and  red bark, and sometimes, though rarely, attains the height of sixty  feet. A tree five feet in circumference will yield fifteen hundred  pounds of green bark, or eight hundred of the dry. The roots contain the  most alkaloid, though the branches are usually barked for commerce. The  true cinchona barks, containing quinine, quinidine, and cinchonine, are  distinguished from the false by their splintery-fibrous texture, the  latter being pre-eminently corky. The cascarilleros begin to hunt for  bark in August. Dr. Taylor, of Riobamba, found one tree which gave $3600  worth of quinine. The general yield is from three to five pounds to a  quintal of bark. The tree has been successfully transplanted to the  United States, and particularly to India, where there are now over a  million of plants. It was introduced into India by Markham in 1861. The  bark is said to be stronger "]]]
