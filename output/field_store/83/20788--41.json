Though these codes of  law, and notably that of Manu in the form in which we possess them, are  of uncertain but probably much later date, they afford us, in  conjunction with the vast body of earlier religious and philosophic  literature, and with a certain amount of scientific literature dealing  with astronomy and astrology, with mathematics and specially with  geometry, and with grammar and prosody, sufficient materials for  appraising, with a fair measure of accuracy, the stage of progress which  the Aryan Hindus had reached in the sixth century B.C. When the world  was young, and they revelled in their recent conquest of a fair portion  in it, they delighted to worship the bright gods who had helped them to  possess it, and worship and war were the ties that kept their loose  tribal organisation together. Out of the primitive conditions of nomadic  and pastoral life, under the leadership of tribal elders who were both  priests and warriors, they gradually passed, after many vicissitudes of  peace and war, into more settled forms of agricultural life and  developed into distinct and separate polities of varying vitality, but  still united by the bond of common religious and social institutions in  the face of the indigenous populations whom they drove before them, or  reduced into subjection and slowly assimilated as they moved down  towards and into the Gangetic plain. As the conditions of life grew more  complex, with increasing prosperity and probably longer intervals of  peace, differentiation between classes and professions grew more marked.  There was time and leisure for thinking as well as for fighting, for  contemplation as well as for action. The \"bright\" gods that Nature had  conceived for the early Aryans were fashioned and refashioned by  speculations already laden with the gloom of melancholy and awesomeness  that pervades India. Caste, it may be inferred from the Sanskrit word  _Varna_, which means colour, originally discriminated only between the  Aryan conquerors of relatively fair complexion and the darker aborigines  they had subdued. It was extended to connote the various stratifications  into which Hindu society was settling, and in the stringent rules which  governed the constitution of each caste, and the relations between the  different castes, the old exclusiveness of tribal customs was  perpetuated and intensified.    To the supremacy which the Brahman, as the expounder of the scriptures  and of the laws deduced from them, and the ordained dispenser of divine  favour, through prayer and sacrifice, was able to arrogate to his own  caste, the code of Manu, above all others, bears emphatic witness:         The very birth of Brahmans is a constant incarnation of Dharma....       When a Brahman springs to light he is born above the world, the       chief of all creatures, assigned to guard the treasury of duties,       religious and civil. Whatever exists in the world is all in effect,       though not in form, the wealth of the Brahman, since the Brahman is       entitled to it all by his primogeniture and eminence of birth.    Every offence committed by a Brahman involves a relatively slight  penalty; every offence committed against him the direst punishment. Next  to the Brahman, but far beneath him, is the Kshatrya and beneath him  again the Vaishya. The Shudras are the fourth caste that exists chiefly  to serve the three twice-born castes, and above all the Brahman. As Sir  William Jones observes in the preface to the translation which he was  the first to make a little more than a century ago of these  extraordinarily full and detailed ordinances, they represent a system of  combined despotism and priestcraft, both indeed limited by law, but  artfully conspiring to give mutual support with mutual checks. But  though they abound with minute and childish formalities, though they  prescribe ceremonies often ridiculous, though the punishments they  enact are partial and fanciful, for some crimes dreadfully cruel, for  others reprehensibly slight, though the very morals they lay down, rigid  enough on the whole, are in one or two instances, as in the case of  light oaths and of pious perjury, dangerously relaxed, one must,  nevertheless, admit that, subject to those grave limitations, a spirit  of sublime devotion, of benevolence to mankind, and of amiable  tenderness to all sentient creatures pervades the whole work, and the  style of it has a certain austere majesty that sounds like the language  of legislation and extorts a respectful awe. Above all it is well to  remember that the ordinances of Manu still constitute to-day the  framework of Hindu society, and Brahman judges of the Indian High  Courts, who administer our own very different codes, still cling to them  in private life and quote them in political controversies as the  repositories of inspired wisdom.    It is on this background of tangled religious beliefs and abstruse  philosophic speculations and very precise and elaborate laws framed to  safeguard the twofold authority of priests and kings, but of the latter  always in subordination to the former, that we see men and cities and  organised states assume for the first time historic substance towards  the sixth century B.C. From that date onwards we are on firmer ground.  For though even in much later times the Hindus never produced historians  in the strict sense of the term, we are able to call in aid the valuable  testimony not only of a few indigenous chroniclers but also of Greek and  Chinese and Arab writers and travellers, as well as the authoritative  evidence supplied by epigraphy and numismatics; and though for many  centuries still very infrequently, the precious remains of ancient  monuments. But the original background is never effaced, for the whole  religious and social system, the whole philosophic outlook upon the  world of which I have sought to outline the long and laborious evolution  through prehistoric ages, remained fundamentally immune against change  until the advent of the British to India subjected them to the solvent  of Western civilisation.    One of the most striking peculiarities of Hinduism is that its origin  cannot be associated with any single great teacher or prophet, however  legendary. Still less can it be identified with the personal inspiration  of a Moses or a Christ, of a Confucius or a Mahomed. Only when we reach  the firmer ground of historic times does any commanding personality  emerge to leave a definite and abiding impress upon successive ages. The  first and the greatest is Buddha, and we can still trace to-day his  footsteps in the places where he actually stood and delivered his  message to the world. It was at Buddh Gaya that, after fleeing from the  pomp and luxury of his father's royal palace, he sat and meditated under  the Bo-tree on the vanity and misery of human life, but it was at  Rajagriha, \"the King's House,\" that he first began to preach. Rajagriha,  about 40 miles S.S.E. of the modern Patna, was then the capital of one  of the many small kingdoms that had grown up in the broad valley of the  Ganges. It was already an ancient city of some fame, for the Mahabharata  mentions all the five hills which, as the first Chinese pilgrim,  Fa-Hien, puts it, \"encompass it with a girdle like the walls of a town.\"  It was itself a walled city, and some of the walls, as we can still see  them to-day, represent most probably the earliest structure raised in  India by human hands that has survived down to our own times. They were  no jerry-builders then. Strengthened at sundry points by great square  bastions, the walls of Rajagriha measure in places over seventeen feet  in width and eleven or twelve feet in height, and they are faced with  undressed stones three to five feet in length, without mortar or cement,  but carefully fitted and banded together with a core of smaller blocks  not less carefully laid and packed. They merely supplemented and  completed the natural line of defences provided by the outer girdle of  hills, rising to 1200 feet, which shut off Rajagriha from the plain of  Bihar. On one of those peerless days of the cold season in Upper India  when there is not a cloud to break the serenity of the deep blue sky, I  looked up to the mountain Ghridrakuta, on whose slopes Buddha dwelt for  some time after he had found enlightenment at Buddh Gaya, and saw it  just as the second Chinese pilgrim to whom we owe most of our knowledge  of Rajagriha described it--\"a solitary peak rising to a great height on  which vultures make their abode.\" Many had been the revolutions of the  wheel of time since Hiuen-Tsang had watched the circling of the vultures  round the sacred peak some twelve and a half centuries before me, and as  Buddha himself, another twelve and a half centuries earlier, must have  watched them when he miraculously stretched forth his hand through a  great rock to rescue his beloved disciple Ananda from the clutch of the  demon Mara, who had taken on the shape of a vulture. The swoop of those  great birds seemed to invest the whole scene with a new and living  reality. Across the intervening centuries I could follow King Bimbisara,  who reigned in those days at Rajagriha, proceeding along the causeway of  rough, undressed stones, which can be traced to-day to the foot of the  mountain and up its rocky flanks, after his men had \"levelled the valley  and spanned the precipices, and with the stones had made a staircase  about ten paces wide,\" so that he should himself be carried up to wait  in his own royal person on the Lord Buddha. There, marked to the present  day by the remains of two large _stupas_, was the place where the king  alighted from his litter to go forward on foot, and farther up again the  spot where he dismissed his followers and went on alone to invite the  Buddha to come down and dwell in his capital.

People sometimes ask me if I  am nervous before a recital. It is not that I am afraid of people; but I  am always anxious about being able to realize my ideal, when the moment  comes.    \"I can say I prefer playing in America to anywhere else in the world;  for there are more real appreciation and understanding here than in any  other country. Of course the great music centers all over the world are  about the same; but the difference lies in the smaller cities, which in  America are far more advanced musically than in Europe. I have proved  this to be the case repeatedly. Not long ago I was booked for a couple  of recitals in a small town of not more than two thousand inhabitants.  When I arrived at the little place, and saw the barn of a hotel, I  wondered what these people could want with piano recitals. But when I  came to the college where I was to play and found such a large,  intelligent audience gathered, some of whom had traveled many miles to  be present, it proved in what estimation music was held. The teacher of  this school was a good musician, who had studied nine years with  Leschetizky, in Vienna; the pupils understood the numbers on the  program, were wide awake, and well informed as to what was going on in  the world of music.    \"One handicap the present day pianist encounters, who plays much with  orchestra, and that is the dearth of modern concertos. The familiar ten  or dozen famous ones are played over and over, and one seldom hears  anything new. There are new ones written, to be sure, but the public has  not learned to care for them. The beautiful second concerto of  Rachmaninoff has not made a success, even in the great music centers,  where the most intelligent audiences have heard it. I believe that if an  audience of the best musicians could be assembled in a small room and  this work could be played to them, they could not fail to be impressed  with its beauties. I am now studying a new concerto by Haddon Wood,  which you see in manuscript there on the piano; it is one I find very  beautiful.\"    A subsequent conversation with the artist elicited the following:    \"I might say that I began my music when about four years old, by playing  the Russian National Hymn, on a toy piano containing eight keys, which  had been given me. My older sister, who was studying the piano, noticed  this, showed me a few things about the notes, and I constantly picked  out little tunes and pieces on the real piano. Finally one day my  sister's teacher, Rudolph Heim, came to the house, mainly on my account.  This was in Odessa, in the south of Russia, where I was born and where I  spent my early years. On this occasion, he wanted to look at me and see  what I could do. Unluckily a sudden fit of shyness overcame me and I  began to cry; the exhibition could not take place, as nothing could be  made out of me that day. You see I was headstrong even at that early  age,\" said the young pianist, with one of her charming smiles.    \"Soon after this incident, I was taken to the Professor's studio. He  examined me, considered I had talent, and thought it should be  cultivated. So he took me in hand. I was then five, and my real musical  education began at that time.    \"From the very first I adopted a position of hand which seemed to me  most convenient and comfortable, and no amount of contrary instruction  and advice has ever been able to make me change it. I play scales and  passages with low hand and flat fingers because that position seems the  most favorable for my hand. When practising, I play everything very  slowly, raising my fingers high and straight from the knuckle joint.  This gives me great clearness and firmness. In rapid passage work the  action is reduced, but the position remains. I am said to have a clear,  pearly touch, with quite sufficient power at my command for large works.    \"After five years of study with my first teacher, Rudolph Heim, a pupil  of Moscheles, I entered the Moscow Conservatory, and continued my  studies under Professor Pabst, brother and teacher of the composer of  that name. I was then ten years old. Professor Pabst was very  conservative, very strict, and kept me at work on the music of the older  masters. This kind of music suits me, I think; at least I enjoy it. Even  here I still clung to my ideas of holding my hands and of touching the  keys, and always expect to do so.    \"I remained with this professor about six years and then began my public  career.    \"You ask about my present studies, and how I regulate my practise.  During my periods of rest from concert work, I practise a great deal--I  wish I could say all the time, but that is not quite possible. I give an  hour or more a day to technical practise. As to the material, I use  Chopin's Etudes constantly, playing them with high-raised, outstretched  fingers, in very slow tempo. One finds almost every technical problem  illustrated in these etudes; octaves, arpeggios, scales in double thirds  and sixths, repeated notes, as in number 7, broken chords and passage  work. I keep all these etudes in daily practise, also using some of the  Liszt _Etudes Transcendantes_, and, of course, Bach. The advantage of  using this sort of material is that one never tires of it; it is always  interesting and beautiful. With this material well in hand, I am always  ready for recital, and need only to add special pieces and modern music.    \"In learning a new work I first study it very slowly, trying to become  familiar with its meaning. I form my concept of it and _live_ with it  for months before I care to bring it forward. I try to form an ideal  conception of the piece, work this out in every detail, then always  endeavor to render it as closely like the ideal as possible.\"          VII    ETHEL LEGINSKA    RELAXATION THE KEYNOTE OF MODERN PIANO PLAYING      The brilliant young pianist, Ethel Leginska, who is located for a time  in America, was seen in her Carnegie Hall studio, on her return from a  concert tour. The young English girl is a petite brunette; her face is  very expressive, her manner at once vivacious and serious. The firm  muscles of her fine, shapely hands indicate that she must spend many  hours daily at the keyboard.    \"Yes, I have played a great deal in public--all my life, in fact--ever  since I was six. I began my musical studies at Hull, where we lived; my  first teacher was a pupil of McFarren. Later I was taken to London,  where some rich people did a great deal for me. Afterward I went to  Leschetizky, and was with him several years, until I was sixteen; I also  studied in Berlin. Then I began my career, and concertized all over  Europe; now I am in America for a time. I like it here; I am fond of  your country already.    \"The piano is such a wonderful instrument to me; I feel we are only  beginning to fathom its possibilities; not in a technical sense, but as  a big avenue for expression. For me the piano is capable of reflecting  every mood, every feeling; all pathos, joy, sorrow--the good and the  evil too--all there is in life, all that one has lived.\" (This recalls a  recently published remark of J. S. Van Cleve: \"The piano can sing, march,  dance, sparkle, thunder, weep, sneer, question, assert, complain,  whisper, hint; in one word it is the most versatile and plastic of  instruments.\")    \"As for the technic of the piano, I think of it only as the  material--only as a means to an end. In fact I endeavor to get away from  the thought of the technical material, in order that I may get at the  meaning of the music I wish to interpret. I am convinced there is a  great future for the piano and its music. Even now we are taking piano  music very seriously, and are trying to interpret it in a far deeper and  broader sense than the pianists of, say, fifty years ago ever thought of  doing. I fancy if Clara Schumann, for instance, could return and play  to us, or even Liszt himself, we should not find their playing suited to  this age at all. Some of us yet remember the hand position Mme. Schumann  had, the lack of freedom in fingers and arms. It was not the fashion of  her time to play with the relaxed freedom, with the breadth and depth of  style which we demand of artists to-day. In those days relaxation had  not received the attention it deserved, therefore we should probably  find the playing of the greatest artists of a former generation stiff  and angular, in spite of all we have heard of their wonderful  performances.    \"Relaxation is a hobby with me; I believe in absolute freedom in every  part of the arm anatomy, from the shoulder down to the finger-tips.  Stiffness seems to me the most reprehensible thing in piano playing, as  well as the most common fault with all kinds of players. When people  come to play for me, that is the thing I see first in them, the  stiffness. While living in Berlin, I saw much of Mme. Teresa Carreno,  and she feels the same as I do about relaxation, not only at the  keyboard, but when sitting, moving about or walking. She has thought  along this line so constantly, that sometimes, if carrying something in  hand, she will inadvertently let it drop, without realizing it--from  sheer force of the habit of relaxation.    \"You ask how I would begin with a young pupil who never has had lessons.  I use the principle of relaxation first of all, loosening arms and  wrists. This principle can be taught to the youngest pupil. The wrist is  elevated and lowered, as the hand is formed on the keys in its five  finger position, with arched knuckles. It does not take long to acquire  this relaxed condition; then come the finger movements. I do not believe  in lifting the fingers high above the keys; this takes time and  interferes with velocity and power. I lift my fingers but little above  the keys, yet I have plenty of power, all the critics agree on that. In  chords and octaves I get all the power I need by grasping the keys with  weight and pressure. I do not"]]]
