She could not find her goats anywhere although for a long time she  searched. They came to her at last of their own accord from behind a  fold in the hills, and they were more wildly excited than she had ever  seen them before. Even the cows forsook their solemnity and broke into  awkward gambols around her. As she walked home that evening a strange  elation taught her feet to dance. Hither and thither she flitted in  front of the beasts and behind them. Her feet tripped to a wayward  measure. There was a tune in her ears and she danced to it, throwing  her arms out and above her head and swaying and bending as she went.  The full freedom of her body was hers now: the lightness and poise and  certainty of her limbs delighted her, and the strength that did not  tire delighted her also. The evening was full of peace and quietude, the  mellow, dusky sunlight made a path for her feet, and everywhere through  the wide fields birds were flashing and singing, and she sang with them  a song that had no words and wanted none.    The following day she heard the music again, faint and thin, wonderfully  sweet and as wild as the song of a bird, but it was a melody which  no bird would adhere to. A theme was repeated again and again. In the  middle of trills, grace-notes, runs and catches it recurred with a  strange, almost holy, solemnity,--a hushing, slender melody full of  austerity and aloofness. There was something in it to set her heart  beating. She yearned to it with her ears and her lips. Was it joy,  menace, carelessness? She did not know, but this she did know, that  however terrible it was personal to her. It was her unborn thought  strangely audible and felt rather than understood.    On that day she did not see anybody either. She drove her charges home  in the evening listlessly and the beasts also were very quiet.    When the music came again she made no effort to discover where it came  from. She only listened, and when the tune was ended she saw a figure  rise from the fold of a little hill. The sunlight was gleaming from his  arms and shoulders but the rest of his body was hidden by the bracken,  and he did not look at her as he went away playing softly on a double  pipe.    The next day he did look at her. He stood waist-deep in greenery  fronting her squarely. She had never seen so strange a face before. Her  eyes almost died on him as she gazed and he returned her look for a long  minute with an intent, expressionless regard. His hair was a cluster of  brown curls, his nose was little and straight, and his wide mouth  drooped sadly at the corners. His eyes were wide and most mournful, and  his forehead was very broad and white. His sad eyes and mouth almost  made her weep.    When he turned away he smiled at her, and it was as though the sun had  shone suddenly in a dark place, banishing all sadness and gloom. Then he  went mincingly away. As he went he lifted the slender double reed to his  lips and blew a few careless notes.    The next day he fronted her as before, looking down to her eyes from a  short distance. He played for only a few moments, and fitfully, and then  he came to her. When he left the bracken the girl suddenly clapped  her hands against her eyes affrighted. There was something different,  terrible about him. The upper part of his body was beautiful, but the  lower part.... She dared not look at him again. She would have risen and  fled away but she feared he might pursue her, and the thought of such  a chase and the inevitable capture froze her blood. The thought of  anything behind us is always terrible. The sound of pursuing feet is  worse than the murder from which we fly--So she sat still and waited but  nothing happened. At last, desperately, she dropped her hands. He was  sitting on the ground a few paces from her. He was not looking at her  but far away sidewards across the spreading hill. His legs were crossed;  they were shaggy and hoofed like the legs of a goat: but she would not  look at these because of his wonderful, sad, grotesque face. Gaiety is  good to look upon and an innocent face is delightful to our souls,  but no woman can resist sadness or weakness, and ugliness she dare  not resist. Her nature leaps to be the comforter. It is her reason. It  exalts her to an ecstasy wherein nothing but the sacrifice of herself  has any proportion. Men are not fathers by instinct but by chance, but  women are mothers beyond thought, beyond instinct which is the father  of thought. Motherliness, pity, self-sacrifice--these are the charges  of her primal cell, and not even the discovery that men are comedians,  liars, and egotists will wean her from this. As she looked at the pathos  of his face she repudiated the hideousness of his body. The beast  which is in all men is glossed by women; it is his childishness, the  destructive energy inseparable from youth and high spirits, and it is  always forgiven by women, often forgotten, sometimes, and not rarely,  cherished and fostered.    After a few moments of this silence he placed the reed to his lips and  played a plaintive little air, and then he spoke to her in a strange  voice, coming like a wind from distant places.    \"What is your name, Shepherd Girl?\" said he.    \"Caitilin, Ingin Ni Murrachu,\" she whispered.    \"Daughter of Murrachu,\" said he, \"I have come from a far place where  there are high hills. The men and maidens who follow their flocks in  that place know me and love me for I am the Master of the Shepherds.  They sing and dance and are glad when I come to them in the sunlight;  but in this country no people have done any reverence to me. The  shepherds fly away when they hear my pipes in the pastures; the maidens  scream in fear when I dance to them in the meadows. I am very lonely in  this strange country. You also, although you danced to the music of my  pipes, have covered your face against me and made no reverence.\"    \"I will do whatever you say if it is right,\" said she.    \"You must not do anything because it is right, but because it is your  wish. Right is a word and Wrong is a word, but the sun shines in the  morning and the dew falls in the dusk without thinking of these words  which have no meaning. The bee flies to the flower and the seed goes  abroad and is happy. Is that right, Shepherd Girl?--it is wrong also.  I come to you because the bee goes to the flower--it is wrong! If I did  not come to you to whom would I go? There is no right and no wrong but  only the will of the gods.\"    \"I am afraid of you,\" said the girl.    \"You fear me because my legs are shaggy like the legs of a goat. Look at  them well, O Maiden, and know that they are indeed the legs of a beast  and then you will not be afraid any more. Do you not love beasts? Surely  you should love them for they yearn to you humbly or fiercely, craving  your hand upon their heads as I do. If I were not fashioned thus I would  not come to you because I would not need you. Man is a god and a brute.  He aspires to the stars with his head but his feet are contented in  the grasses of the field, and when he forsakes the brute upon which he  stands then there will be no more men and no more women and the immortal  gods will blow this world away like smoke.\"    \"I don't know what you want me to do,\" said the girl.    \"I want you to want me. I want you to forget right and wrong; to be as  happy as the beasts, as careless as the flowers and the birds. To live  to the depths of your nature as well as to the heights. Truly there are  stars in the heights and they will be a garland for your forehead. But  the depths are equal to the heights. Wondrous deep are the depths, very  fertile is the lowest deep. There are stars there also, brighter than  the stars on high. The name of the heights is Wisdom and the name of the  depths is Love. How shall they come together and be fruitful if you do  not plunge deeply and fearlessly? Wisdom is the spirit and the wings of  the spirit, Love is the shaggy beast that goes down. Gallantly he dives,  below thought, beyond Wisdom, to rise again as high above these as he  had first descended. Wisdom is righteous and clean, but Love is unclean  and holy. I sing of the beast and the descent: the great unclean purging  itself in fire: the thought that is not born in the measure or the ice  or the head, but in the feet and the hot blood and the pulse of fury.  The Crown of Life is not lodged in the sun: the wise gods have buried it  deeply where the thoughtful will not find it, nor the good: but the Gay  Ones, the Adventurous Ones, the Careless Plungers, they will bring it to  the wise and astonish them. All things are seen in the light--How shall  we value that which is easy to see? But the precious things which  are hidden, they will be more precious for our search: they will be  beautiful with our sorrow: they will be noble because of our desire for  them. Come away with me, Shepherd Girl, through the fields, and we will  be careless and happy, and we will leave thought to find us when it can,  for that is the duty of thought, and it is more anxious to discover us  than we are to be found.\"    So Caitilin Ni Murrachu arose and went with him through the fields, and  she did not go with him because of love, nor because his words had been  understood by her, but only because he was naked and unashamed.          CHAPTER VII    IT was on account of his daughter that Meehawl MacMurrachu had come to  visit the Philosopher. He did not know what had become of her, and the  facts he had to lay before his adviser were very few.    He left the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath taking snuff under a pine tree  and went into the house.    \"God be with all here,\" said he as he entered.    \"God be with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#6)"],[1,"as its predominant note, flowed freely into Spain  from England and France. Spain had remained preeminently  the home of romanticism when France and England had  turned to classicism, and only in the second half of the  eighteenth century had Spanish writers given to classicism  a reception that was at the best lukewarm. Now romanticism  was welcomed back with open arms, and Spanish writers  turned eagerly for inspiration not only to Chateaubriand,  Victor Hugo and Byron, but also to Lope de Vega and  Calderon. Spain has always worshiped the past, for Spain  was once great, and the appeal of romanticism was             page xxxv  therefore the greater as it drew its material largely  from national sources.    In 1830 a club known as the Parnasillo was formed in  Madrid to spread the new literary theories, much as the  Cenacle had done in Paris. The members of the Parnasillo  met in a wretched little cafe to avoid public attention.  Here were to be found Breton de los Herreros, Estebanez  Calderon, Mesonero Romanos, Gil y Zarate, Ventura de la  Vega, Espronceda and Larra. The influence of Spanish epic  and dramatic poetry had been important in stimulating the  growth of romanticism in England, Germany and France. In  England, Robert Southey translated into English the  poem and the chronicle of the Cid and Sir Walter Scott  published his Vision of Don Roderick; in Germany, Herder's  translation of some of the Cid _romances_ and the Schlegel  brothers' metrical version of Calderon's dramas had called  attention to the merit of the earlier Spanish literature;  and in France, Abel Hugo translated into French the  _Romancero_ and his brother Victor made Spanish subjects  popular with _Hernani_ and _Ruy Blas_ and the _Legendes  des siecles_. But Spain, under the despotism of Ferdinand  VII, the \"Tyrant of Literature,\" remained apparently  indifferent or even hostile to its own wonderful  creations, and clung outwardly to French  neo-classicism.[2] Boehl von Faber,[3] the German consul at  Cadiz, who was influenced by the Schlegel brothers,  had early called attention to the merit of the Spanish  literature of the Golden Age and had even had some of  Calderon's plays performed at Cadiz. And in                  page xxxvi  1832 Duran published his epoch-making _Romancero_. In 1833  Ferdinand VII died and the romantic movement was hastened  by the home-coming of a number of men who had fled the  despotism of the monarch and had spent some time in  England and France, where they had come into contact with  the romanticists of those countries. Prominent amongst  these were Martinez de la Rosa, Antonio Alcala Galiano,  the Duke of Rivas and Espronceda.    [Footnote 2: Cf. _l'Epopee castillane_, Ramon Menendez  Pidal, Paris, 1910, pp. 249-252.]    [Footnote 3: The father of Fernan Caballero.]    In this period of transition one of the first prominent  men of letters to show the effects of romanticism was  Francisco MARTINEZ DE LA ROSA (1787-1862). Among his  earlier writings are a _Poetica_ and several odes in honor  of the heroes of the War of Independence against the  French. After his exile in Paris he returned home imbued  with romanticism, and his two plays, _Conjuracion de  Venecia_ (1834) and _Aben Humeya_ (1836: it had already  been given in French at Paris in 1830), mark the first  public triumph of romanticism in Spain. But Martinez de  la Rosa lacked force and originality and his works merely  paved the way for the greater triumph of the Duke of  Rivas. Angel de Saavedra, DUQUE DE RIVAS (1791-1865), a  liberal noble, insured the definite triumph of romanticism  in Spain by the successful performance of his drama  _Don Alvaro_ (1835). At first a follower of Moratin and  Quintana, he turned, after several years of exile in  England, the Isle of Malta and France, to the new romantic  school, and casting off all classical restraints  soon became the acknowledged leader of the Spanish  romanticists. Among his better works are the lyric _Al  faro de Malta_, the legendary narrative poem _El moro  exposito_ and his _Romances historicos_. The _Romances_  are more sober in tone and less fantastic,--and it should  be added, less popular to-day,--than the legends of         page xxxvii  Zorrilla. After a tempestuous life the Duke of  Rivas settled quietly into the place of director of the  Spanish Academy, which post he held till his death.    Jose de ESPRONCEDA (1808-1842) was preeminently a  disciple of Byron, with Byron's mingling of pessimism and  aspiration, and like him in revolt against the established  order of things in politics and social organization. His  passionate outpourings, his brilliant imagery and the  music of his verse give to Espronceda a first place  amongst the Spanish lyrical poets of the nineteenth  century. Some of his shorter lyrics (e.g. _Canto a  Teresa_) are inspired by his one-time passion for Teresa  with whom after her marriage to another he eloped from  London to Paris. The poet's best known longer works are  the _Diablo mundo_ and the _Estudiante de Salamanca_,  which are largely made up of detached lyrics in which the  subjective note is strikingly prominent. Espronceda was  one of those fortunate few who shine in the world of  letters although they work little. Both in lyric mastery  and in his spirit of revolt, Espronceda holds the place in  Spanish literature that is held in English by Byron. He  is the chief Spanish exponent of a great revolutionary  movement that swept over the world of letters in the first  half of the nineteenth century.    Jose ZORRILLA (1817-1893) first won fame by the reading  of an elegy at the burial of Larra. Zorrilla was a most  prolific and spontaneous writer of verses, much of which  is unfinished in form and deficient in philosophical  insight. But in spite of his carelessness and shallowness  he rivaled Espronceda in popularity. His verses are not  seldom melodramatic or childish, but they are rich in  coloring and poetic fancy and they form a                  page xxxviii  vast enchanted world in which the Spaniards still delight  to wander. His versions of old Spanish legends are  doubtless his most enduring work and their appeal to  Spanish patriotism is not less potent to-day than when  they were written. Zorrilla's dramatic works were  successful on the stage by reason of their primitive  vigor, especially _Don Juan Tenorio_, _El Zapatero y el  rey_ and _Traidor, inconfeso y martir_. This \"fantastic  and legendary poet\" went to Mexico in 1854 and he remained  there several years. After that date he wrote little and  the little lacked merit.    Gertrudis Gomez de AVELLANEDA (1814-1873) was born in Cuba  but spent most of her life in Spain. Avellaneda was a  graceful writer of lyrics in which there was feeling and  melody but little depth of thought. With her the moving  impulse was love, both human and divine. Her first volume  of poems (1841) probably contains her best work. Her  novels _Sab_ and _Espatolino_ were popular in their day  but are now fallen into oblivion. Some of her plays,  especially _Baltasar_ and _Munio_, do not lack merit.  Avellaneda is recognized as the foremost poet amongst the  women of nineteenth-century Spain.    Two of the most successful dramatists of this period,  Garcia Gutierrez and Hartzenbusch, were also lyric poets.  Antonio GARCIA GUTIERREZ (1813-1884), the author of _El  trovador_, published two volumes of mediocre verses.  Juan Eugenio HARTZENBUSCH (1806-1880) was, like Fernan  Caballero, the child of a German father and a Spanish  mother. Though an eminent scholar and critic, he did not  hesitate in his _Amantes de Teruel_ to play to the popular  passion for sentimentality. He produced some lyric verse  of worth. Manuel BRETON DE LOS HERREROS (1796-1873) was  primarily a humorist and satirist, who turned from           page xxxix  lyric verse to drama as his best medium of  expression. He delighted in holding up to ridicule the  excesses of romanticism. Mention should be made here of  two poets who had been, like Espronceda, pupils of Alberto  Lista. The eclectic poet MARQUES DE MOLINS (Mariano Roca  de Togores: 1812-1889) wrote passively in all the literary  genres of his time. VENTURA DE LA VEGA (1807-1865) was  born in Argentina, but came to Spain at an early age. He  was a well-balanced, cautious writer of mediocre verses  that are rather neo-classic than romantic.    A marked reaction against the grandiose exaggerations of  later romanticism appears in the works of Jose SELGAS  y Carrasco (1824-1882), a clever writer of simple,  sentimental verses. At one time his poetry was highly  praised and widely read, but for the most part it is  to-day censured as severely as it was once praised. Among  the contemporaries of Selgas were the writer of simple  verses and one-time popular tales, Antonio de TRUEBA  (1821-1889) and Eduardo BUSTILLO, the author of _Las  cuatro estaciones_ and _El ciego de Buenavista_. Somewhat  of the tradition of the Sevillan school persisted in the  verses of Manuel CANETE and Narciso CAMPILLO (1838-1900)  and in those of the poet and literary critic Jose AMADOR  DE LOS RIOS.    The Sevillan Gustavo Adolfo BECQUER (1836-1870) wrote  perhaps the most highly polished Spanish verse of the  nineteenth century. His _Rimas_ are charged with true  poetic fancy and the sweetest melody, but the many  inversions of word-order that were used to attain to  perfection of metrical form detract not a little from  their charm. His writings are contained in three small  volumes in which are found, together with the _Rimas_, a  collection of prose legends. His prose work is                  page xl  filled with morbid mysticism or fairy-like mystery. His  dreamy prose is often compared to that of Hoffmann and his  verses to those of Heine, although it is doubtful if he  was largely influenced by either of these German writers.  Becquer sings primarily of idealized human love. His  material life"]]]
