The gold eagles which her father had  given her at Christmas and on her birthday did not seem half so  valuable.    But she did not have much time to think of all this. The bell rang  again. This time it was a boy--a big fellow of about fourteen, she  guessed, an untidy-looking boy with large, intent black eyes. A mass  of black hair, which surely had not been combed, fell about a face  that as certainly had not been washed that morning.    \"Give me one of those blue tops in the window,\" he said gruffly. He  did not add these words but his manner seemed to say, \"And be quick  about it!\" He threw his money down on the counter so hard that one  of the pennies spun off into a corner.    He did not offer to pick the penny up. He did not even apologize.  And he looked very carefully at the top Maida handed him as if he  expected her to cheat him. Then he walked out.    It was getting towards school-time. Children seemed to spring up  everywhere as if they grew out of the ground. The quiet streets  began to ring with the cries of boys playing tag, leap frog and  prisoners' base. The little girls, much more quiet, squatted in  groups on doorsteps or walked slowly up and down, arm-in-arm. But  Maida had little time to watch this picture. The bell was ringing  every minute now. Once there were six children in the little shop  together.    \"Do you need any help?\" Granny called.    \"No, Granny, not yet,\" Maida answered cheerfully.    But just the same, she did have to hurry. The children asked her for  all kinds of things and sometimes she could not remember where she  had put them. When in answer to the school bell the long lines began  to form at the big doorways, two round red spots were glowing in  Maida's cheeks. She drew an involuntary sigh of relief when she  realized that she was going to have a chance to rest. But first she  counted the money she had taken in. Thirty-seven cents! It seemed a  great deal to her.    For an hour or more, nobody entered the shop. Billy left in a little  while for Boston. Granny, crooning an old Irish song, busied herself  upstairs in her bedroom. Maida sat back in her chair, dreaming  happily of her work. Suddenly the bell tinkled, rousing her with a  start.    It seemed a long time after the bell rang before the door opened.  But at last Maida saw the reason of the delay. The little boy who  stood on the threshold was lame. Maida would have known that he was  sick even if she had not seen the crutches that held him up, or the  iron cage that confined one leg.    His face was as colorless as if it had been made of melted wax. His  forehead was lined almost as if he were old. A tired expression in  his eyes showed that he did not sleep like other children. He must  often suffer, too--his mouth had a drawn look that Maida knew well.    The little boy moved slowly over to the counter. It could hardly be  said that he walked. He seemed to swing between his crutches exactly  as a pendulum swings in a tall clock. Perhaps he saw the sympathy  that ran from Maida's warm heart to her pale face, for before he  spoke he smiled. And when he smiled you could not possibly think of  him as sick or sad. The corners of his mouth and the corners of his  eyes seemed to fly up together. It made your spirits leap just to  look at him.    \"I'd like a sheet of red tissue paper,\" he said briskly.    Maida's happy expression changed. It was the first time that anybody  had asked her for anything which she did not have.    \"I'm afraid I haven't any,\" she said regretfully.    The boy looked disappointed. He started to go away. Then he turned  hopefully. \"Mrs. Murdock always kept her tissue paper in that drawer  there,\" he said, pointing.    \"Oh, yes, I do remember,\" Maida exclaimed. She recalled now a few  sheets of tissue paper that she had left there, not knowing what to  do with them. She pulled the drawer open. There they were, neatly  folded, as she had left them.    \"What did Mrs. Murdock charge for it?\" she inquired.    \"A cent a sheet.\"    Maida thought busily. \"I'm selling out all the old stock,\" she said.  \"You can have all that's left for a cent if you want it.\"    \"Sure!\" the boy exclaimed. \"Jiminy crickets! That's a stroke of luck  I wasn't expecting.\"    He spread the half dozen sheets out on the counter and ran through  them. He looked up into Maida's face as if he wanted to thank her  but did not know how to put it. Instead, he stared about the shop.  \"Say,\" he exclaimed, \"you've made this store look grand. I'd never  know it for the same place. And your sign's a crackajack.\"    The praise--the first she had had from outside--pleased Maida. It  emboldened her to go on with the conversation.    \"You don't go to school,\" she said.    The moment she had spoken, she regretted it. It was plain to be  seen, she reproached herself inwardly, why he did not go to school.    \"No,\" the boy said soberly. \"I can't go yet. Doc O'Brien says I can  go next year, he thinks. I'm wild to go. The other fellows hate  school but I love it. I s'pose it's because I can't go that I want  to. But, then, I want to learn to read. A fellow can have a good  time anywhere if he knows how to read. I can read some,\" he added in  a shamed tone, \"but not much. The trouble is I don't have anybody to  listen and help with the hard words.\"    \"Oh, let me help you!\" Maida cried. \"I can read as easy as  anything.\" This was the second thing she regretted saying. For when  she came to think of it, she could not see where she was going to  have much time to herself.    But the little lame boy shook his head. \"Can't,\" he said decidedly.  \"You see, I'm busy at home all day long and you'll be busy here. My  mother works out and I have to do most of the housework and take  care of the baby. Pretty slow work on crutches, you know--although  it's easy enough getting round after you get the hang of it. No, I  really don't have any time to fool until evenings.\"    \"Evenings!\" Maida exclaimed electrically. \"Why, that's just the  right time! You see I'm pretty busy myself during the daytime--at my  business.\" Her voice grew a little important on that last phrase.  \"Granny! Granny!\" she called.    Granny Flynn appeared in the doorway. Her eyes grew soft with pity  when they fell on the little lame boy. \"The poor little gossoon!\"  she murmured.    \"Granny,\" Maida explained, \"this little boy can't go to school  because his mother works all day and he has to do the housework and  take care of the baby, too, and he wants to learn to read because he  thinks he won't be half so lonely with books, and you know, Granny,  that's perfectly true, for I never suffered half so much with my  legs after I learned to read.\"    It had all poured out in an uninterrupted stream. She had to stop  here to get breath.    \"Now, Granny, what I want you to do is to let me hear him read  evenings until he learns how. You see his mother comes home then and  he can leave the baby with her. Oh, do let me do it, Granny! I'm  sure I could. And I really think you ought to. For, if you'll excuse  me for saying so, Granny, I don't think you can understand as well  as I do what a difference it will make.\" She turned to the boy.  \"Have you read 'Little Men' and 'Little Women'?\"    \"No--why, I'm only in the first reader.\"    \"I'll read them to you,\" Maida said decisively, \"and 'Treasure  Island' and 'The Princes and the Goblins' and 'The Princess and  Curdie.'\" She reeled off the long list of her favorites.    In the meantime, Granny was considering the matter. Dr. Pierce had  said to her of Maida: \"Let her do anything that she wants to do--as  long as it doesn't interfere with her eating and sleeping. The main  thing to do is to get her _to want to do things_.\"    \"What's your name, my lad?\" she asked.    \"Dicky Dore, ma'am,\" the boy answered respectfully.    \"Well, Oi don't see why you shouldn't thry ut, acushla,\" she said to  Maida. \"A half an hour iv'ry avening after dinner. Sure, in a wake,  'twill be foine and grand we'll be wid the little store running like  a clock.\"    \"We'll begin next week, Monday,\" Maida said eagerly. \"You come over  here right after dinner.\"    \"All right.\" The little lame boy looked very happy but, again, he  did not seem to know what to say. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he brought out  finally. \"And you, too,\" turning to Maida.    \"My name's Maida.\"    \"Thank you, Maida,\" the boy said with even a greater display of  bashfulness. He settled the crutches under his thin shoulders.    \"Oh, don't go, yet,\" Maida pleaded. \"I want to ask you some  questions. Tell me the names of those dear little girls--the twins.\"    Dicky Dore smiled his radiant smile. \"Their last name's Clark. Say,  ain't they the dead ringers for each other? I can't tell Dorothy  from Mabel or Mabel from Dorothy.\"    \"I can't, either,\" Maida laughed. \"It must be fun to be a twin--to  have any kind of a sister or brother. Who's that big boy--the one  with the hair all hanging down on his face?\"    \"Oh, that's Arthur Duncan.\" Dicky's whole face shone. \"He's a dandy.  He can lick any boy of his size in the neighborhood. I bet he could  lick any boy of his size in the world. I bet he could lick his  weight in wild-cats.\"    Maida's brow wrinkled. \"I don't like him,\" she said. \"He's not  polite.\"    \"Well, I like him,\" Dicky Dore maintained stoutly. \"He's the best  friend I've got anywhere. Arthur hasn't any mother, and his father's  gone all day. He takes care of himself. He comes over to my place a  lot. You'll like him when you know him.\"    The bell tinkling on his departure did not ring again till noon. But  Maida did not mind.    \"Granny,\" she said after Dicky left, \"I think I've made a friend.  Not a friend somebody's brought to me--but a friend of my very own.  Just think of that!\"    At twelve, Maida watched the children pour out of the little  schoolhouse and disappear in all directions. At two, she watched  them reappear from all directions and pour into it again."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#6)"],[1,"was no very rare  event, this state of things did not appear, to Francis, as outrageous  as it would do to an English lad of the present day, but he shook his  head.    \"Of course one understands, Matteo, that everywhere powerful nobles do  things which would be regarded as crimes if done by others; but,  elsewhere, people can fortify their houses, and call out and arm their  retainers, and stand on their guard. But that here, in a city like  this, private feuds should be carried on, and men stabbed when  unconscious of danger, seems to me detestable.\"    \"Of course it isn't right,\" Matteo said carelessly, \"but I don't know  how you are going to put a stop to it; and after all, our quarrels here  only involve a life or two, while in other countries nobles go to war  with each other, and hundreds of lives, of people who have nothing to  do with the quarrel, may be sacrificed.\"    This was a light in which Francis had hardly looked upon the matter  before, and he was obliged to own that even private assassination,  detestable as it was, yet caused much less suffering than feudal war.  Still, he was not disposed entirely to give in to his friend's opinion.    \"That is true, Matteo; but at the same time, in a war it is fair  fighting, while a stab in the back is a cowardly business.\"    \"It is not always fair fighting,\" Matteo replied. \"You hear of castles  being surprised, and the people massacred without a chance of  resistance; of villages being burned, and the people butchered  unresistingly. I don't think there is so much more fairness one way  than the other. Polani knows he will have to be careful, and if he  likes he can hire bravos to put Ruggiero out of the way, just as  Ruggiero can do to remove him. There's a good deal to be said for both  sides of the question.\"    Francis felt this was so, and that although he had an abhorrence of the  Venetian method of settling quarrels, he saw that as far as the public  were concerned, it was really preferable to the feudal method, of both  parties calling out their retainers and going to war with each other,  especially as assassinations played no inconsiderable part in the  feudal struggles of the time.    On the Thursday night the gondola was in waiting at the agreed spot.  Francis had thought it probable that the stranger might this time ask  some questions as to where they lived and their usual place of plying  for hire, and would endeavour to find out as much as he could about  them, as they could not but suspect that he was engaged in some very  unusual enterprise. He had therefore warned Giuseppi to be very careful  in his replies. He knew that it was not necessary to say more, for  Giuseppi had plenty of shrewdness, and would, he was sure, invent some  plausible story without the least difficulty, possessing, as he did,  plenty of the easy mendacity so general among the lower classes of the  races inhabiting countries bordering on the Mediterranean. Their fare  came down to the gondola a few minutes after the clock had tolled the  half hour.    \"I see you are punctual,\" he said, \"which is more than most of you men  are.\"    Francis was rowing the bow oar, and therefore stood with his back to  the passenger, and was not likely to be addressed by him, as he would  naturally turn to Giuseppi, who stood close behind him. As Francis had  expected, as soon as they were out on the lagoon the passenger turned  to his companion and began to question him.    \"I cannot see your faces,\" he said; \"but by your figures you are both  young, are you not?\"    \"I am but twenty-two,\" Giuseppi said, \"and my brother is a year  younger.\"    \"And what are your names?\"    \"Giovanni and Beppo Morani.\"    \"And is this boat your own?\"    \"It is, signor. Our father died three years ago, leaving us his boat.\"    \"And where do you usually ply?\"    \"Anywhere, signor, just as the fancy seizes us. Sometimes one place is  good, sometimes another.\"    \"And where do you live?\"    \"We don't live anywhere, signor. When night comes, and business is  over, we tie up the boat to a post, wrap ourselves up, and go to sleep  at the bottom. It costs nothing, and we are just as comfortable there  as we should be on straw in a room.\"    \"Then you must be saving money.\"    \"Yes; we are laying money by. Some day, I suppose, we shall marry, and  our wives must have homes. Besides, sometimes we are lazy and don't  work. One must have some pleasure, you know.\"    \"Would you like to enter service?\"    \"No, signor. We prefer being our own masters; to take a fare or leave  it as we please.\"    \"Your boat is a very fast one. You went at a tremendous rate when the  galley was after us the other night.\"    \"The boat is like others,\" Giuseppi said carelessly; \"but most men can  row fast when the alternative is ten ducats one way or a prison the  other.\"    \"Then there would be no place where I could always find you in the  daytime if I wanted you?\"    \"No, signor; there would be no saying where we might be. We have  sometimes regular customers, and it would not pay us to disappoint  them, even if you paid us five times the ordinary fare. But we could  always meet you at night anywhere, when you choose to appoint.\"    \"But how can I appoint,\" the passenger said irritably, \"if I don't know  where to find you?\"    Giuseppi was silent for a stroke or two.    \"If your excellency would write in figures, half past ten or eleven, or  whatever time we should meet you, just at the base of the column of the  palace--the corner one on the Piazzetta--we should be sure to be there  sometime or other during the day, and would look for it.\"    \"You can read and write, then?\" the passenger asked.    \"I cannot do that, signor,\" Giuseppi said, \"but I can make out figures.  That is necessary to us, as how else could we keep time with our  customers? We can read the sundials, as everyone else can; but as to  reading and writing, that is not for poor lads like us.\"    The stranger was satisfied. Certainly every one could read the  sundials; and the gondoliers would, as they said, understand his  figures if he wrote them.    \"Very well,\" he said. \"It is probable I shall generally know, each time  I discharge you, when I shall want you again; but should there be any  change, I will make the figures on the base of the column at the corner  of the Piazzetta, and that will mean the hour at which you are to meet  me that night at the usual place.\"    Nothing more was said, until the gondola arrived at the same spot at  which it had landed the passenger on the previous occasion.    \"I shall be back in about the same time as before,\" the fare said when  he alighted.    As he strode away into the darkness, Francis followed him. He was  shoeless, for at that time the lower class seldom wore any protection  to the feet, unless when going a journey over rough ground. Among the  gondoliers shoes were unknown; and Francis himself generally took his  off, for coolness and comfort, when out for the evening in his boat.    He kept some distance behind the man he was following, for as there  were no hedges or inclosures, he could make out his figure against the  sky at a considerable distance. As Francis had expected, he did not  make towards the village, but kept along the island at a short distance  from the edge of the water.    Presently Francis heard the dip of oars, and a gondola ran up on the  sands halfway between himself and the man he was following. He threw  himself down on the ground. Two men alighted, and went in the same  direction as the one who had gone ahead.    Francis made a detour, so as to avoid being noticed by the gondoliers,  and then again followed. After keeping more than a quarter of a mile  near the water, the two figures ahead struck inshore. Francis followed  them, and in a few minutes they stopped at a black mass, rising above  the sand. He heard them knock, and then a low murmur, as if they were  answering some question from within. Then they entered, and a door  closed.    He moved up to the building. It was a hut of some size, but had a  deserted appearance. It stood between two ridges of low sand hills, and  the sand had drifted till it was halfway up the walls. There was no  garden or inclosure round it, and any passerby would have concluded  that it was uninhabited. The shutters were closed, and no gleam of  light showed from within.    After stepping carefully round it, Francis took his post round the  angle close to the door, and waited. Presently he heard footsteps  approaching--three knocks were given on the door, and a voice within  asked, \"Who is there?\"    The reply was, \"One who is in distress.\"    The question came, \"What ails you?\"    And the answer, \"All is wrong within.\"    Then there was a sound of bars being withdrawn, and the door opened and  closed again.    There were four other arrivals. The same questions were asked and  answered each time. Then some minutes elapsed without any fresh comers,  and Francis thought that the number was probably complete. He lay down  on the sand, and with his dagger began to make a hole through the wood,  which was old and rotten, and gave him no difficulty in piercing it.    He applied his eye to the orifice, and saw that there were some twelve  men seated round a table. Of those facing him he knew three or four by  sight; all were men of good family. Two of them belonged to the  council, but not to the inner Council of Ten. One, sitting at the top  of the table, was speaking; but although Francis applied his ear to the  hole he had made, he could hear but a confused murmur, and could not  catch the words. He now rose cautiously, scooped up the sand so as to  cover the hole in the wall, and swept a little down over the spot where  he had been lying, although he had no doubt that the breeze, which  would spring up before morning, would soon drift the light shifting  sand over it, and obliterate the mark of his recumbent figure. Then he  went round to the other"]]]
