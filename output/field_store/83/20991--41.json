He was also very sorry to hear that Bertram has to give up his studies and  return home. Shoghi Effendi hopes that this period he spent in America  would be itself an education that would help him in his work in serving  the Cause. His activities with the young people there should have made him  very experienced and have deepened his understanding of the Faith.    I believe Mrs Dunn is planning to come this spring for a visit to Haifa.  Perhaps you will meet her before she starts, Shoghi Effendi is eagerly  waiting to see this noble soul who introduced the Cause into Australia and  has been so self-sacrificing in her services.    Shoghi Effendi hopes that on returning home you will start again to serve  the Cause and attract new souls. The world is in great distress and its  only salvation is in the spirit and teachings of the Blessed Beauty. Let  us not, we who are the trustees of that divine message, fail in  accomplishing our task and fulfilling our purpose.    Assuring you of Shoghi Effendi's best wishes I remain    Yours ever sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _I am wiring the friends in Port-Said to meet you on your arrival and I  very much regret your inability to come to Haifa and visit the holy  shrines. I will continue to pray for you, for your son-in-law and for your  dear and promising son for whose future work in the Cause I cherish the  brightest hopes. I will also remember in my prayers the friends in  far-away Australia and New Zealand and will supplicate for them all the  Master's richest blessings and unfailing guidance._    _Shoghi_          (23) April 29th, 1933      Dear Baha'i Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you[+E8] for your kind letter of March  16th 1933, as well as the enclosed article which has been translated by  Mr. Paul into the Maori language.    The Guardian has already written Mr. Paul and expressed to him his deep  appreciation for the service he has rendered to the Faith, but especially  to his own people who through the means of such literature will be  acquainted with the teachings and will receive the light of guidance  brought to the world by Baha'u'llah.    I believe the Guardian has already intimated his approval of this pamphlet  and the desire that the friends in Australia publish and circulate it  among the Maoris.    As regards the passages in the sacred writings indicating the wrath of  God; Shoghi Effendi says that the Divinity has many attributes: He is  loving and merciful but also just. Just as reward and punishment,  according to Baha'u'llah, are the pillars upon which society rests, so  mercy and justice may be considered as their counterpart in the world to  come. Should we disobey God and work against His commands He will view our  acts in the light of justice and punish us for it. That punishment may not  be in the form of fire, as some believe, but in the form of spiritual  deprivation and degradation. This is why we read so often in the prayers  statements such as \"God do not deal with us with justice, but rather  through thy infinite mercy.\" The wrath of God is in the administration of  His justice, both in this world and in the world to come. A God that is  only loving or only just is not a perfect God. The divinity has to possess  both of these aspects as every father ought to express both in his  attitude towards his children. If we ponder a while, we will see that our  welfare can be insured only when both of these divine attributes are  equally emphasised and practiced.    In closing may I express the Guardian's loving greetings and best wishes  for the progress of your work in serving the Cause.    Yours ever sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Almighty bless your efforts, deepen your understanding of the  essentials and distinguishing features of His Faith, guide your steps, and  aid and assist you to extend the range of your activities and services._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (24) September 1st, 1933      Dear Baha'i Friend,    Shoghi Effendi has directed me to address you these few lines,  acknowledging the receipt of your welcome letter of July 20th, 33, which  he has read with deepest interest. He was gratified to learn that you have  newly embraced the Cause and that you are earnestly endeavouring to spread  it through every possible means. It is on young and active Baha'is, like  you, that the Guardian centers all his hopes for the future progress and  expansion of the Cause and it is on their shoulders that he lays all the  responsibility for the upkeep of the spirit of selfless service among  their fellow-believers. Without that spirit, no work can be successfully  achieved. With it triumph, though hardly-won, is but inevitable. You  should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame within you the torch  of faith, for through it you will surely find guidance, strength and  eventual success.    The Guardian is fully conscious of the difficulties that impede the  progress of the Faith in your community. Chief among these, you mention  the lack of courage and of initiative on the part of the believers, and a  feeling of inferiority complex which prevents them from addressing the  public. It is precisely these weaknesses that he wishes the friends to  overcome, for these do not only paralyze their efforts but actually serve  to quench the flame of faith in their hearts. Not until all the friends  come to realize that every one of them is able, in his own measure, to  deliver the Message, can they ever hope to reach the goal that has been  set before them by a loving and wise Master. It is no use waiting for some  able and eloquent teacher to take all the responsibility for the spread of  the Cause. For such a thing is not only contrary to the spirit of the  Teachings but to the explicit text of the writings of Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha, both of whom place the obligation of teaching not on any  particular class, as in former ecclesiastical organizations, but on every  faithful and loyal follower of the Cause. The teaching of the Word is thus  made universal and compulsory. How long then shall we wait to carry out  this command, the full wisdom of which only future generations will be  able to appreciate? We have no special teachers in the Cause. Everyone is  a potential teacher. He has only to use what God has given him and thus  prove that he is faithful to his trust.    Visiting teachers, who are, at least in a general way, supposed to be more  competent and able than the rest, are undoubtedly of a great help. But  these can never replace the mass of individual believers and fulfil what  must be inevitably accomplished through the collective effort and wisdom  of the community at large. What visiting teachers are supposed to do is to  give the final touch to the work that has been done, to consolidate rather  than supplement individual efforts and thereby direct them in a  constructive and suitable channel. Their task is to encourage and inspire  individual believers, and to broaden and deepen their vision of the task  that is to be done. And this, not by virtue of any inherent spiritual  right, but in the spirit of simple and whole-hearted cooperation.    It is in this light that Shoghi Effendi views the whole problem of  teaching not only in New Zealand but in all the Baha'i world. He would,  therefore, encourage you to take a leading part in the carrying out of his  wishes on this point, to take yourself an active interest in teaching, not  only private but also public, and in this way stimulate the friends to  follow your example. It is then, and only then, that there can be a need  for a qualified and competent visiting teacher in order to bring to full  fruition individual teaching efforts.    Assuring you of our Guardian's fervent prayers on your behalf, so that you  may be increasingly blessed in your efforts for the spread of the Message.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _May the Beloved guide your steps, cheer your heart, deepen your  understanding of the distinguishing features of His Faith and enable you  to render the sacred Threshold unique and inestimable services,_    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_            PART III  LETTERS TO INDIVIDUALS, MAY 1934-1957.      The first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand was  formed in 1957.          (25) June 13th, 1934      Dear Baha'i Brother,    The Guardian has duly received and deeply enjoyed reading your letters  dated November 30th, December 27th, 1933 and February 4th, 1934. He is  sorry that unforeseen circumstances have caused such a long delay in  acknowledging their receipt. He hopes, however, that the matters you have  submitted for his consideration have not suffered as a result.    Since your last letter to him, he has heard of the gratifying news of the  formation of your N.S.A.(3) This historic step in the development of the  Administration in Australia and New Zealand is, he feels, bound to react  favourably on the further expansion and consolidation of the Faith in  these far-off lands. He is fervently supplicating Baha'u'llah that the  newly-elected members of the N.S.A.,(4) upon whom has been placed such a  tremendous responsibility, be assisted in the discharge of their sacred  obligations and duties to the Faith.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-worker:_    _The splendid reports you have sent me have been incorporated in the  manuscript and sent to the Baha'i World Committee in America. The  formation of the national assembly of Australia and New Zealand will no  doubt furnish you with new and refreshing material for your next report in  1936. I will pray for your success and deeply value the manifold and  constant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#6)"],[1,"their  approval and consent. These are His very words in that Tablet:--\"His honor,  Sheikh Faraju'llah, has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the  I_sh_raqat and yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the  Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its publication upon  the approval of the above-named Assembly. This is so that things may be  arranged in an orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may  translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his own account.  Even a non-believer might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion  and disorder. If it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the  Spiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a  non-believer will have no recognition whatever.\"    This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire that  nothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the  friends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in  his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that  pertains to the general interest of the Cause in that land, then it is  incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration  and approval of the national body representing all the various local  assemblies. Not only with regard to publication, but all matters without  any exception whatsoever, regarding the interests of the Cause in that  locality, individually or collectively, should be referred exclusively to  the Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it,  unless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be  referred to the national body. With this national body also will rest the  decision whether a given question is of local or national interest. (By  national affairs is not meant matters that are political in their  character, for the friends of God the world over are strictly forbidden to  meddle with political affairs in any way whatever, but rather things that  affect the spiritual activities of the body of the friends in that land.)    Full harmony, however, as well as cooperation among the various local  assemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between each  assembly and the national body, is of the utmost importance, for upon it  depends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the friends, the  full, speedy and efficient working of the spiritual activities of His  loved ones.          Committees of the National Assembly      Large issues in such spiritual activities that affect the Cause in general  in that land, such as the management of the \"Star of the West\" and any  periodical which the National Body may decide to be a Baha'i organ, the  matter of publication, or reprinting Baha'i literature and its  distribution among the various assemblies, the means whereby the teaching  campaign may be stimulated and maintained, the work of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the racial question in relation to the Cause, the  matter of receiving Orientals and association with them, the care and  maintenance of the precious film exhibiting a phase of the Master's  sojourn in the United States of America as well as the original matrix and  the records of His voice, and various other national spiritual activities,  far from being under the exclusive jurisdiction of any local assembly or  group of friends, must each be minutely and fully directed by a special  board, elected by the National Body, constituted as a committee thereof,  responsible to it and upon which the National Body shall exercise constant  and general supervision.    The time is indeed ripe for the manifold activities, wherein the servants  and handmaids of Baha'u'llah are so devoutly and earnestly engaged, to be  harmonized and conducted with unity, cooperation and efficiency, that the  effect of such a combined and systematized effort, through which an  All-powerful Spirit is steadily pouring, may transcend every other  achievement of the past, however glorious it has been, and may stand, now  that, to the eyes of the outside world the glorious Person of the Master  is no more, a convincing testimony of the potency of His everliving  Spirit.    Your brother and co-worker in His Cause,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  March 5, 1922.          Letter of Circa May, 1922 (undated).      IN THE NAME OF GOD    This servant, after that grievous event and great calamity, the ascension  of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha to the Abha Kingdom, has been so stricken  with grief and pain and so entangled in the troubles (created) by the  enemies of the Cause of God, that I consider that my presence here, at  such a time and in such an atmosphere, is not in accordance with the  fulfilment of my important and sacred duties.    For this reason, unable to do otherwise, I have left for a time the  affairs of the Cause both at home and abroad, under the supervision of the  Holy Family and the headship of the Greatest Holy Leaf(2) until, by the  Grace of God, having gained health, strength, self-confidence and  spiritual energy, and having taken into my hands, in accordance with my  aim and desire, entirely and regularly the work of service I shall attain  to my utmost spiritual hope and aspiration.    The servant of His Threshold,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  Circa May, 1922 (undated).          Our Common Servitude      May I also express my heartfelt desire that the friends of God in every  land regard me in no other light but that of a true brother, united with  them in our common servitude to the Master's Sacred Threshold, and refer  to me in their letters and verbal addresses always as Shoghi Effendi, for  I desire to be known by no other name save the one our Beloved Master was  wont to utter, a name which of all other designations is the most  conducive to my spiritual growth and advancement.    Haifa, Palestine.  Circa May, 1922 (undated).          Letter of December 16, 1922      To the loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout the continent of America.    Dear fellow-workers in the Holy Vineyard of Baha!    Now that my long hours of rest and meditation are happily at an end, I  turn my face with renewed hope and vigor to that vast continent the soil  of which is pregnant with those seeds that our beloved Master has so  tenderly and so profusely scattered in the past. Prolonged though this  period has been, yet I have strongly felt ever since the New Day has  dawned upon me that such a needed retirement, despite the temporary  dislocations it might entail, would far outweigh in its results any  immediate service I could have humbly tendered at the Threshold of  Baha'u'llah.    I am now confident that the energies of my beloved brethren and sisters  across the seas, far from being damped by my sudden disappearance from the  field of service, will henceforth be fully maintained, nay redoubled in  their intensity, that we may all together carry triumphantly to the  uttermost corners of the world the glorious Standard of Baha.    Bereft of all news whatsoever during my hours of restful seclusion, I now  feel the more the thrill of the various tidings, few but indeed promising,  that have been awaiting my return to the Holy Land. The work of the noble  Edifice that the mighty hands of the All-wise Master has reared in this  world can suffer no delay, nor can its foundations be made to totter,  whatever the apparent obstacles its enemies in their impotent wrath and  despair may throw in its way. We need not wait too long, for already from  various quarters there comes the news that the awful promises of  'Abdu'l-Baha regarding the Covenant-breakers have been strikingly  fulfilled!    But it behooves us not to dwell for a moment on these doomed and darkened  efforts, for the shining light of the Master's unfailing guidance is  beckoning us to more constructive service, to nobler and worthier  achievements.    We have, not a long time ago, with tearful eyes commemorated the world  over the passing hour of our beloved Master. Would to God it has marked in  our lives, which we all have consecrated to His service, a fresh, solemn  and unswerving resolution of devotion and fidelity to His Cause    Your brother and co-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  December 16, 1922.          Letter of December 23rd, 1922      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, the elected  representatives of all believers throughout the continent of America.    Esteemed co-workers in the Vineyard of God:    To have been unable, owing to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, to  correspond with you ever since you entered upon your manifold and arduous  duties is to me a cause of deep regret and sad surprise! I am however  assured and sustained by the conviction, never dimmed in my mind, that  whatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, however disquieting in its  immediate effects, is fraught with infinite Wisdom and tends ultimately to  promote its interests in the world. Indeed, our experiences of the distant  past, as well as of recent events, are too numerous and varied to permit  of any misgiving or doubt as to the truth of this basic principle--a  principle which throughout the vicissitudes of our sacred mission in this  world we must never disregard or forget.    I cannot refrain from expressing in this, my first letter to you my deep  gratitude and great pleasure in learning how promptly, thoroughly and  admirably you have conducted the affairs of the Cause in that land. Of the  sincerity of your efforts, of the determination with which you have faced  your delicate and difficult task, I have never doubted for a moment, as I  knew too well of the ardent spirit of service and fellowship which the  sudden passing of our Beloved had infused in all his followers everywhere.  But great was my surprise to know how the ever-present Hand of the Master  has removed so speedily all the difficulties in our way and how the light  of His"]]]
