The Dauphin Louis died in 1417; his next brother, John, who  was more inclined to Burgundy, did not survive him a year; and the third  brother, Charles, a mere boy, was in the hands of the Armagnacs. In 1418  their reckless misuse of power provoked the citizens of Paris into  letting in the Burgundians, when an unspeakably horrible massacre took  place. Bernard of Armagnac himself was killed; his naked corpse, scored  with his red cross, was dragged about the streets; and men, women, and  even infants of his party were slaughtered pitilessly. Tanneguy  Duchatel, one of his partisans, carried off the dauphin; but the queen,  weary of Armagnac insolence, had joined the Burgundian party.      10. Treaty of Troyes.--Meanwhile Henry V. continued to advance, and  John of Burgundy felt the need of joining the whole strength of France  against him, and made overtures to the dauphin. Duchatel, either fearing  to be overshadowed by his power, or else in revenge for Orleans and  Armagnac, no sooner saw that a reconciliation was likely to take place,  than he murdered John the Fearless before the dauphin's eyes, at a  conference on the bridge of Montereau-sur-Yonne (1419). John's wound was  said to be the hole which let the English into France. His son Philip,  the new Duke of Burgundy, viewing the dauphin as guilty of his death,  went over with all his forces to Henry V., taking with him the queen and  the poor helpless king. At the treaty of Troyes, in 1420, Henry was  declared regent, and heir of the kingdom, at the same time as he  received the hand of Catherine, daughter of Charles VI. This gave him  Paris and all the chief cities in northern France; but the Armagnacs  held the south, with the Dauphin Charles at their head. Charles was  declared an outlaw by his father's court, but he was in truth the leader  of what had become the national and patriotic cause. During this time,  after a long struggle and schism, the Pope again returned to Rome.      11. The Maid of Orleans.--When Henry V. died in 1422, and the unhappy  Charles a few weeks later, the infant Henry VI. was proclaimed King of  France as well as of England, at both Paris and London, while _Charles  VII._ was only proclaimed at Bourges, and a few other places in the  south. Charles was of a slow, sluggish nature, and the men around him  were selfish and pleasure-loving intriguers, who kept aloof all the  bolder spirits from him. The brother of Henry V., John, Duke of Bedford,  ruled all the country north of the Loire, with Rouen as his  head-quarters. For seven years little was done; but in 1429 he caused  Orleans to be besieged. The city held out bravely, all France looked on  anxiously, and a young peasant girl, named Joan d'Arc, believed herself  called by voices from the saints to rescue the city, and lead the king  to his coronation at Rheims. With difficulty she obtained a hearing of  the king, and was allowed to proceed to Orleans. Leading the army with a  consecrated sword, which she never stained with blood, she filled the  French with confidence, the English with fear as of a witch, and thus  she gained the day wherever she appeared. Orleans was saved, and she  then conducted Charles VII. to Rheims, and stood beside his throne when  he was crowned. Then she said her work was done, and would have returned  home; but, though the wretched king and his court never appreciated her,  they thought her useful with the soldiers, and would not let her leave  them. She had lost her heart and hope, and the men began to be angered  at her for putting down all vice and foul language. The captains were  envious of her; and at last, when she had led a sally out of the  besieged town of Compiegne, the gates were shut, and she was made  prisoner by a Burgundian, John of Luxembourg. The Burgundians hated her  even more than the English. The inquisitor was of their party, and a  court was held at Rouen, which condemned her to die as a witch. Bedford  consented, but left the city before the execution. Her own king made no  effort to save her, though, many years later, he caused enquiries to be  made, established her innocence, ennobled her family, and freed her  village from taxation.    12. Recovery of France (1434--1450).--But though Joan was gone, her  work lasted. The Constable, Artur of Richmond, the Count of Dunois, and  other brave leaders, continued to attack the English. After seventeen  years' vengeance for his father's death, the Duke of Burgundy made his  peace with Charles by a treaty at Arras, on condition of paying no more  homage, in 1434. Bedford died soon after, and there were nothing but  disputes among the English. Paris opened its gates to the king, and  Charles, almost in spite of himself, was restored. An able merchant,  named Jacques Coeur, lent him money which equipped his men for the  recovery of Normandy, and he himself, waking into activity, took Rouen  and the other cities on the coast.      13. Conquest of Aquitaine (1450).--By these successes Charles had  recovered all, save Calais, that Henry V. or Edward III. had taken from  France. But he was now able to do more. The one province of the south  which the French kings had never been able to win was Guienne, the duchy  on the river Garonne. Guienne had been a part of Eleanor's inheritance,  and passed through her to the English kings; but though they had lost  all else, the hatred of its inhabitants to the French enabled them to  retain this, and Guienne had never yet passed under French rule. It was  wrested, however, from Eleanor's descendants in this flood-tide of  conquest. Bordeaux held out as long as it could, but Henry VI. could  send no aid, and it was forced to yield. Two years later, brave old Lord  Talbot led 5000 men to recover the duchy, and was gladly welcomed; but  he was slain in the battle of Castillon, fighting like a lion. His two  sons fell beside him, and his army was broken. Bordeaux again  surrendered, and the French kings at last found themselves master of the  great fief of the south. Calais was, at the close of the great Hundred  Years' War, the only possession left to England south of the Channel.      14. The Standing Army (1452).--As at the end of the first act in the  Hundred Years' War, the great difficulty in time of peace was the  presence of the bands of free companions, or mercenary soldiers, who,  when war and plunder failed them, lived by violence and robbery of the  peasants. Charles VII., who had awakened into vigour, thereupon took  into regular pay all who would submit to discipline, and the rest were  led off on two futile expeditions into Switzerland and Germany, and  there left to their fate. The princes and nobles were at first so much  disgusted at the regulations which bound the soldiery to respect the  magistracy, that they raised a rebellion, which was fostered by the  Dauphin Louis, who was ready to do anything that could annoy his father.  But he was soon detached from them; the Duke of Burgundy would not  assist them, and the league fell to pieces. Charles VII. by thus  retaining companies of hired troops in his pay laid the foundation of  the first standing army in Europe, and enabled the monarchy to tread  down the feudal force of the nobles. His government was firm and wise;  and with his reign began better times for France. But it was long before  it recovered from the miseries of the long strife. The war had kept back  much of progress. There had been grievous havoc of buildings in the  north and centre of France; much lawlessness and cruelty prevailed; and  yet there was a certain advance in learning, and much love of romance  and the theory of chivalry. Pages of noble birth were bred up in castles  to be first squires and then knights. There was immense formality and  stateliness, the order of precedence was most minute, and pomp and  display were wonderful. Strange alternations took place. One month the  streets of Paris would be a scene of horrible famine, where hungry dogs,  and even wolves, put an end to the miseries of starving, homeless  children of slaughtered parents; another, the people would be gazing at  royal banquets, lasting a whole day, with allegorical \"subtleties\" of  jelly on the table, and pageants coming between the courses, where all  the Virtues harangued in turn, or where knights delivered maidens from  giants and \"salvage men.\" In the south there was less misery and more  progress. Jacques Coeur's house at Bourges is still a marvel of  household architecture; and Rene, Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence,  was an excellent painter on glass, and also a poet.          CHAPTER III.    THE STRUGGLE WITH BURGUNDY.      1. Power of Burgundy.--All the troubles of France, for the last 80  years, had gone to increase the strength of the Dukes of Burgundy. The  county and duchy, of which Dijon was the capital, lay in the most  fertile district of France, and had, as we have seen, been conferred on  Philip the Bold. His marriage had given to him Flanders, with a gallant  nobility, and with the chief manufacturing cities of Northern Europe.  Philip's son, John the Fearless, had married a lady who ultimately  brought into the family the great imperial counties of Holland and  Zealand; and her son, Duke Philip the Good, by purchase or inheritance,  obtained possession of all the adjoining little fiefs forming the  country called the Netherlands, some belonging to the Empire, some to  France. Philip had turned the scale in the struggle between England and  France, and, as his reward, had won the cities on the Somme. He had  thus become the richest and most powerful prince in Europe, and seemed  on the point of founding a middle state lying between France and  Germany, his weak point being that the imperial fiefs in Lorraine and  Elsass lay between his dukedom of Burgundy and his counties in the  Netherlands. No European court equalled in splendour that of Philip.

A detailed history of the ballet is, however, impossible here, and we  must proceed to touch only on salient points. It passed from the  Court to the theatre about 1680 and had two characteristics, one with  feminine dancers, the other without.    [Illustration: Fig. 63a.--Dancing satyr playing castanets, by Myron,  in the Vatican Museum. The action is entirely suggestive of that of  Fanny Ellsler, and might be evidence of the antiquity of the Spanish  tradition.]    It is not a little curious that wearing the mask, a revival of the  antique, was practised in some of these ballets. The history of the  opera-ballet of those days gives to us many celebrated names of  musicians, such as Destouches, who gave new \"verve\" to ballet music,  and Rameau. Jean Georges Noverre abolished the singing and established  the five-act ballet on its own footing in 1776. In this it appears he  had partly the advice of Garrick, whom he met in London. The names of  the celebrated dancers are numerous, such as Pecourt, Blaudy (who  taught Mlle. Camargo), Laval, Vestris, Germain, Prevost, Lafontaine,  and Camargo (fig. 61), of the 18th century; Taglioni, Grisi, Duvernay,  Cerito, Ellsler, etc., of the 19th century, to those of our own day. A  fair notice of all of these would be a work in itself.    [Illustration: Fig. 64.--Mlle. Taglioni. From a lithograph of the  period.]    The introduction of the ballet into England was as late as 1734, when  the French dancers, Mlle. Salle, the rival of Mlle. Camargo, and Mlle.  de Subligny made a great success at Covent Garden in \"Ariadne and  Galatea,\" and Mlle. Salle danced in her own choregraphic invention of  \"Pygmalion,\" since which time it has been popular in England, when  those of the first class can be obtained. There are, however, some  interesting and romantic circumstances connected with the ballet in  London in the last century, which it will not be out of place to  record here. Amongst the dancers of the last century of considerable  celebrity were two already mentioned, Mlles. Duvernay (fig. 62) and  Taglioni (fig. 64), whose names are recorded in the classic verse of  \"Ingoldsby.\"        \"Malibran's dead, Duvernay's fled;       Taglioni has not yet arrived in her stead.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 65.--_Pas de Trois_ by Mlles. Ferraris, Taglioni,  and Carlotta Grisi.]    Mlle. Duvernay was a Parisian, and commenced her study under Barrez,  but subsequently was under Vestris and Taglioni, the father of the  celebrity mentioned in the verse.    [Illustration: Fig. 66.--Mlle. Adeline Genee, 1906. Photo, Ellis and  Walery.]    Duran hangs over the mantelpiece of the refectory of the presbytery.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.--Mlle. Anna Pavlova, 1910. From a photo by  Foulsham and Banfield.]    Having made a great Parisian reputation, she came to London in 1833,  and from that date until 1837 held the town, when she married Mr.  Stephens Lyne Stephens, M.P., a gentleman of considerable wealth, but  was left a childless widow in 1861, and retired to her estate at  Lyneford Hall, Norfolk, living in retirement and spending her time in  good works. She is said to have spent L100,000 in charities and  churches, and that at Cambridge, dedicated to the English martyrs, was  founded, completed, and endowed by her. She led a blameless and  worthy life, and died in 1894. Her portrait by Mlle. Taglioni (fig.  64), her co-celebrity, married Count Gilbert de Voisins, a French  nobleman, in 1847, and with her marriage came an ample fortune;  unfortunately the bulk of this fortune was lost in the Franco-German  war. With the courage of her character the Countess returned to London  and gave lessons in dancing, etc., in which she was sufficiently  successful to obtain a fair living. She died in 1884 at 80 years of  age. Of the other celebrities of the period--Carlotta Grisi, Ferraris  (fig. 65), and Fanny Ellsler (fig. 63)--some illustrations are given;  besides these were Fanny Cerito, Lucile Grahn, a Dane, and some others  of lesser notoriety performing in London at this great period of the  ballet.    [Illustration: Fig. 68.--Mlle. Sophie Fedorova.]    The recent encouragement of the classic ballet has introduced us to  some exquisite dancers: amongst these are Mlle. Adeline Genee (fig.  66) and Mlle. Anna Pavlova (fig. 67); the latter, with M. Mordkin and  a corps of splendid dancers, are from Russia, from whence also comes  the important troupe now at the Alhambra with Mlle. Geltzer and other  excellent dancers. The celebrated company at Covent Garden, and Lydia  Kyasht at the Empire, are also Russian. It is not surprising that we  get excellent dancing from Russia; the school formed by Peter the  Great about 1698 has been under State patronage ever since.    Notices of all the important dancers from Italy, Spain, Paris, or  elsewhere, performing in England in recent years, would occupy  considerable space, and the reader can easily obtain information  concerning them elsewhere.    That the technique and speed of the classic dance has considerably  increased is historically certain, and we must hope that this speed  will not sacrifice graceful movement. Moreover, technique alone will  not make the complete fine-artist: some invention is involved.  Unfortunately, some modern attempts at invention seem crude and  sensational, whilst lacking the exquisite technique desirable in all  exhibitions of finished art.    Before concluding it is almost imperative to say something about the  naked foot dancers, followers of Isidora Duncan. Some critics and a  certain public have welcomed them; but is it not \"sham antique\"? It  does not remind one of the really classic. Moreover, the naked foot  should be of antique beauty, which in most of these cases it is not.  Advertisements tell us that these dance are interpretations of classic  music--Chopin, Weber, Brahms, etc.; they are not really  interpretations, but distractions! We can hardly imagine that these  composers intended their work for actual dancing. One can listen and  be entranced; one sees the dancer's \"interpretations\" or  \"translations\" and the music is degraded to a series of sham classic  postures.    The idea that running about the stage in diaphanous costumes, with  conventional mimicry and arm action, is classic or beautiful is a  mistake; the term aesthetic may cover, but not redeem it. There is not  even the art of the ordinary ballet-dancer discernible in these  proceedings.    On another plane are such as the ballets in \"Don Giovanni\" and  \"Faust.\" Mozart and Gounod wrote these with a full knowledge of the  method of interpretation and the persons who had been trained for  that purpose--the performers fit the music and it fits them. This  opera-ballet is also more in accordance with tradition before the  time of Noverre.    Neither do the \"popular\" and curious exhibitions of Loie Fuller strike  one as having a classic character, or future, of any consideration,  pretty as they may be.    The operetta or musical comedy has given us some excellent art,  especially at the end of the 19th century, when Sylvia Gray, Kate  Vaughan, Letty Lind, Topsy Sinden, and others of like _metier_ gave us  skirt and drapery dancing.    This introduces us to the question of costume. That commonly used by  the _prima ballerina_ is certainly not graceful; it was apparently  introduced about 1830, presumably to show the action and finished  method of the lower extremities. If Fanny Ellsler and Duvernay could  excel without this ugly contrivance, why is it necessary for others?    At the same time it is better than indifferent imitations of the  Greek, or a return to the debased characteristics of Pompeiian art, in  which the effect of the classic and fine character of the material are  rendered in a sort of transparent muslin.    With these notices the author's object in this sketch is completed. Of  the _bal-masque_ garden dances, public balls and such-like, he has no  intention to treat; they are not classic dancing nor \"art,\" with the  exception perhaps of the Scottish reels. Nor is he interested in the  dancing of savage tribes, nor in that of the East, although some few  illustrations are given to illustrate traditions: for example, the use  of the pipe and tabor in Patagonia, the dancer from Japan, winged,  like that in the \"Roman de la Rose\" (fig. 40), and the religious dance  of Tibet, showing the survival of the religious dance in some  countries. In Mrs. Groves' book on dancing there is an excellent  chapter on the Ritual dance as now practised, to which the reader can  refer.
