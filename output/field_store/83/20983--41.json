(#6)"],[1," their incumbent weight the Roman state, already unequal to the load  which it sustained. Instead of arming the people in their own defence,  the emperors recalled all the distant legions, in whom alone they  could repose confidence; and collected the whole military force for  the defence of the capital and centre of the empire. The necessity of  self-preservation had superseded the ambition of power; and the ancient  point of honor, never to contract the limits of the empire, could no  longer be attended to in this desperate extremity.    Britain by its situation was removed from the fury of these barbarous  incursions; and being also a remote province, not much valued by  the Romans, the legions which defended it were carried over to the  protection of Italy and Gaul. But that province, though secured by  the sea against the inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians, found  enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage of its present defenceless  situation. The Picts and Scots, who dwelt in the northern parts,  beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incursions upon their peaceable and  effeminate neighbors; and besides the temporary depredations which they  committed, these combined nations threatened the whole province with  subjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded, with plunder and  devastation, The Picts seem to have been a tribe of the native British  race, who, having been chased into the northern parts by the conquests  of Agricola, had there intermingled with the ancient inhabitants:  the Scots were derived from the same Celtic origin, had first been  established in Ireland, had migrated to the north-west coasts of this  island, and had long been accustomed, as well from their old as their  new seats, to infest the Roman province by piracy and rapine. [1]         [* See note A, at the end of the volume.]    These tribes finding their more opulent neighbors exposed to invasion,  soon broke over the Roman wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms;  and, though a contemptible enemy in themselves, met with no resistance  from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britons, accustomed to have recourse  to the emperors for defence as well as government, made supplications to  Rome: and one legion was sent over for their protection. This force was  an overmatch for the barbarians, repelled their invasion, touted them  in every engagement, and having chased them into their ancient limits,  returned in triumph to the defence of the southern provinces of the  empire.[*]         [* Gildas, Bede, lib. i. cap. 12.]    Their retreat brought on a new invasion of the enemy. The Britons made  again an application to Rome, and again obtained the assistance of a  legion, which proved effectual for their relief: but the Romans, reduced  to extremities at home, and fatigued with those distant expeditions,  informed the Britons that they must no longer look to them for succor,  exhorted them to arm in their own defence, and urged, that, as they were  now their own masters, it became them to protect by their valor that  independence which their ancient lords had conferred upon them.[*] That  they might leave the island with the better grace, the Romans assisted  them in erecting anew the wall of Severus, which was built entirely of  stone, and which the Britons had not at that time artificers skilful  enough to repair.[*]         [* Paul. Diacon. p. 43.]    And having done this last good office to the inhabitants, they bade a  final adieu to Britain, about the year 448, after being masters of the  more considerable part of it during the course of near four centuries.          THE BRITONS.    The abject Britons regarded this present of liberty as fatal to them;  and were in no condition to put in practice the prudent counsel given  them by the Romans, to arm in their own defence. Unaccustomed both  to the perils of war and to the cares of civil government, they found  themselves incapable of forming or executing any measures for resisting  the incursions of the barbarians. Gratian also and Constantine, two  Romans who had a little before assumed the purple in Britain, had  carried over to the continent the flower of the British youth; and  having perished in their unsuccessful attempts on the imperial throne,  had despoiled the island of those who, in this desperate extremity, were  best able to defend it. The Picts and Scots, finding that the Romans had  finally relinquished Britain, now regarded the whole as their prey, and  attacked the northern wall with redoubled forces. The Britons, already  subdued by their own fears, found the ramparts but a weak defence for  them; and deserting their station, left the country entirely open to  the inroads of the barbarous enemy. The invaders carried devastation and  ruin along with them; and exerted to the utmost their native ferocity,  which was not mitigated by the helpless condition and submissive  behavior of the inhabitants.[*]         [* Gildas, Bede, lib. i. Allured. Beverl. p. 45.]    The unhappy Britons had a third time recourse to Rome, which had  declared its resolution forever to abandon them. AEtius, the patrician,  sustained at that time, by his valor and magnanimity, the tottering  ruins of the empire, and revived for a moment among the degenerate  Romans the spirit, as well as discipline, of their ancestors. The  British ambassadors carried to him the letter of their countrymen, which  was inscribed, \"The groans of the Britons.\" The tenor of the epistle was  suitable to its superscription. \"The barbarians,\" say they, \"on the one  hand, chase us into the sea; the sea, on the other, throws us back upon  the barbarians; and we have only the hard choice left us of perishing by  the sword or by the waves.\"[*]         [* Gildas, Bede, lib. i. cap. 13. William of       Malmesbury, lib. i. cap. 1 Alured. Beverl. p. 45.]    But AEtius, pressed by the arms of Attila, the most terrible enemy that  ever assailed the empire, had no leisure to attend to the complaints of  allies, whom generosity alone could induce him to assist.[*]         [* Saxon Chron. p. 11, edit. 1692.]    The Britons, thus rejected, were reduced to despair, deserted their  habitations, abandoned tillage, and flying for protection to the forests  and mountains, suffered equally from hunger and from the enemy. The  barbarians themselves began to feel the pressures of famine in a country  which they had ravaged; and being harassed by the dispersed Britons, who  had not dared to resist them in a body, they retreated with their spoils  into their own country.[*]         [* Alured. Beverl, p. 45.]    The Britons, taking advantage of this interval, returned to their usual  occupations; and the favorable seasons which succeeded, seconding their  industry, made them soon forget their past miseries, and restored  to them great plenty of all the necessaries of life. No more can be  imagined to have been possessed by a people so rude, who had not,  without the assistance of the Romans, art of masonry sufficient to raise  a stone rampart for their own defence; yet the monkish historians,[*]  who treat of those events, complain of the luxury of the Britons  during this period, and ascribe to that vice, not to their cowardice or  improvident counsels, all their subsequent calamities.         [* Gildas, Bede, lib. i. cap. 14.]    The Britons, entirely occupied in the enjoyment of the present interval  of peace, made no provision for resisting the enemy, who, invited by  their former timid behavior, soon threatened them with a new invasion.  We are not exactly informed what species of civil government the Romans,  on their departure, had left among the Britons, but it appears probable  that the great men in the different districts assumed a kind of regal,  though precarious authority, and lived in a great measure independent of  each other.[*]         [* Gildas, Usher, Ant. Brit. p. 248, 347.]    To this disunion of counsels were also added the disputes of theology;  and the disciples of Pelagius, who was himself a native of Britain,  having increased to a great multitude, gave alarm to the clergy, who  seem to have been more intent on suppressing them, than on opposing the  public enemy.[*]         [* Gildas, Bede, lib. i. cap. 17. Constant, in Vita Germ.]    Laboring under these domestic evils, and menaced with a foreign  invasion, the Britons attended only to the suggestions of their present  fears, and following the counsels of Vortigern, prince of Dumnonium,  who, though stained with every vice, possessed the chief authority among  them,[*] they sent into Germany a deputation to invite over the Saxons  for their protection and assistance.         [* Gildas, W. Malms. p. 8.]          THE SAXONS.    Of all the barbarous nations, known either in ancient or modern times,  the Germans seem to have been the most distinguished both by their  manners and political institutions, and to have carried to the highest  pitch the virtues of valor and love of liberty; the only virtues which  can have place among an uncivilized people, where justice and humanity  are commonly neglected. Kingly government, even when established among  the Germans, (for it was not universal,) possessed a very limited  authority; and though the sovereign was usually chosen from among the  royal family, he was directed in every measure by the common consent  of the nation over whom he presided. When any important affairs were  transacted, all the warriors met in arms; the men of greatest authority  employed persuasion to engage their consent; the people expressed their  approbation by rattling their armor, or their dissent by murmurs; there  was no necessity for a nice scrutiny of votes among a multitude, who  were usually carried with a strong current to one side or the other;  and the measure, thus suddenly chosen by general agreement, was executed  with alacrity, and prosecuted with vigor. Even in war, the princes  governed more by example than by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#6)"],[1," the merits of the  person or of the cause; and besides the usual perversions of right in  the decision of controversies, the pope openly assumed an absolute  and uncontrolled authority of setting aside, by the plenitude of his  apostolic power, all particular rules, and all privileges of patrons,  churches, and convents. On pretence of remedying these abuses, Pope  Honorius, in 1226, complaining of the poverty of his see as the source  of all grievances, demanded from every cathedral two of the best  prebends, and from every convent two monks' portions, to be set apart  as a perpetual and settled revenue of the papal crown; but all men  being sensible that the revenue would continue forever, and the abuses  immediately return, his demand was unanimously rejected. About  three years after, the pope demanded and obtained the tenth of all  ecclesiastical revenues, which he levied in a very oppressive manner;  requiring payment before the clergy had drawn their rents or tithes,  and sending about usurers, who advanced them the money at exorbitant  interest. In the year 1240, Otho the legate, having in vain attempted  the clergy in a body, obtained separately, by intrigues and menaces,  large sums from the prelates and convents, and on his departure is said  to have carried more money out of the kingdom than he left in it This  experiment was renewed four years after with success by Martin the  nuncio, who brought from Rome powers of suspending and excommunicating  all clergymen that refused to comply with his demands. The king, who  relied on the pope for the support of his tottering authority, never  failed to countenance those exactions.    Meanwhile all the chief benefices of the kingdom were conferred on  Italians; great numbers of that nation were sent over at one time to be  provided for; non-residence and pluralities were carried to an enormous  height; Mansel, the king's chaplain, is computed to have held at once  seven hundred ecclesiastical livings; and the abuses became so evident,  as to be palpable to the blindness of superstition itself. The people,  entering into associations, rose against the Italian clergy; pillaged  their barns; wasted their lands; insulted the persons of such of them  as they found in the kingdom;[*] and when the justices made inquiry into  the authors of this disorder, the guilt was found to involve so many,  and those of such high rank, that it passed unpunished.    * Rymer, vol. i. p. 323. M. Paris, p. 255, 257.    At last, when Innocent IV., in 1245, called a general council at Lyons,  in order to excommunicate the emperor Frederic, the king and nobility  sent over agents to complain, before the council, of the rapacity of the  Romish church. They represented, among many other grievances, that the  benefices of the Italian clergy in England had been estimated, and were  found to amount to sixty thousand marks[*] a year, a sum which exceeded  the annual revenue of the crown itself.[**] They obtained only an  evasive answer from the pope; but as mention had been made, before the  council, of the feudal subjection of England to the see of Rome,  the English agents, at whose head was Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk,  exclaimed against the pretension, and insisted that King John had no  right, without the consent of his barons, to subject the kingdom to  so ignominious a servitude.[***] The popes, indeed, afraid of carrying  matters too far against England, seem thenceforth to have little  insisted on that pretension.    This check, received at the council of Lyons, was not able to stop the  court of Rome in its rapacity: Innocent exacted the revenues of all  vacant benefices, the twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues without  exception; the third of such as were exceeded a hundred marks a year;  the half of such as were possessed by non-residents.[****] He claimed  the goods of all intestate clergymen;[*****] he pretended a title to  inherit all money gotten by usury: he levied benevolences upon the  people; and when the king, contrary to his usual practice, prohibited  these exactions, he threatened to pronounce against him the same  censures which he had emitted against the emperor Frederic.[******]         * Innocent's bull in Rymer, vol. i. p. 471, says only fifty       thousand marks a year.         ** M. Paris, p. 451. The customs were part of Henry's       revenue, and amounted to six thousand pounds a year: they       were at first email sums paid by the merchants for the use       of the king's ware-houses, measures, weights, etc. See       Gilbert's History of the Exch p. 214.         *** M. Paris, p. 460.         **** M. Paris, p. 480. Ann. Burt. p. 305, 573.         ***** M. Paris, p. 474.         ****** M. Paris, p. 476.    {1255.} But the most oppressive expedient employed by the pope, was the  embarking of Henry in a project for the conquest of Naples, or Sicily  on this side the Fare, as it was called; an enterprise which threw  much dishonor on the king, and involved him, during some years, in great  trouble and expense. The Romish church, taking advantage of favorable  incidents, had reduced the kingdom of Sicily to the same state of feudal  vassalage which she pretended to extend over England; and which, by  reason of the distance, as well as high spirit of this latter kingdom,  she was not able to maintain. After the death of the emperor Frederic  II., the succession of Sicily devolved to Conradine, grandson of that  monarch; and Mainfroy, his natural son, under pretence of governing  the kingdom during the minority of the prince, had formed a scheme  of establishing his own authority. Pope Innocent, who had carried  on violent war against the emperor Frederic, and had endeavored to  dispossess him of his Italian dominions, still continued hostilities  against his grandson; but being disappointed in all his schemes by the  activity and artifices of Mainfroy, he found that his own force alone  was not sufficient to bring to a happy issue so great an enterprise.  He pretended to dispose of the Sicilian crown, both as superior lord of  that particular kingdom, and as vicar of Christ, to whom all kingdoms of  the earth were subjected; and he made a tender of it to Richard, earl of  Cornwall, whose immense riches, he flattered himself, would be able to  support the military operations against Mainfroy. As Richard had the  prudence to refuse the present,[*] he applied to the king, whose levity  and thoughtless disposition gave Innocent more hopes of success; and he  offered him the crown of Sicily for his second son, Edmond.[**]  Henry, allured by so magnificent a present, without reflecting on  the consequences, without consulting either with his brother or the  parliament, accepted of the insidious proposal, and gave the pope  unlimited credit to expend whatever sums he thought necessary for  completing the conquest of Sicily. Innocent, who was engaged by his  own interests to wage war with Mainfroy, was glad to carry on his  enterprises at the expense of his ally: Alexander IV., who succeeded him  in the papal throne, continued the same policy, and Henry was surprised  to find himself on a sudden involved in an immense debt, which he had  never been consulted in contracting. The sum already amounted to a  hundred and thirty-five thousand five hundred and forty-one marks,  beside interest;[***] and he had the prospect, if he answered this  demand, of being soon loaded with more exorbitant expenses if he refused  it, of both incurring the pope's displeasure, and losing the crown of  Sicily, which he hoped soon to have the glory of fixing on the head of  his son.         * M. Paris, p.650.         ** Rymer, vol. i. p. 502, 512, 530. M. Paris, p. 599, 613         *** Rymer, vol i. p. 587. Chron. Dunst vol. i. p. 319.    He applied to the parliament for supplies; and that he might be sure not  to meet with opposition, he sent no writs to the more refractory barons:  but even those who were summoned, sensible of the ridiculous cheat  imposed by the pope, determined not to lavish their money on such  chimerical projects; and making a pretext of the absence of their  brethren, they refused to take the king's demands into consideration.[*]  In this extremity the clergy were his only resource; and as both their  temporal and spiritual sovereign concurred in loading them, they were  ill able to defend themselves against this united authority.    The pope published a crusade for the conquest of Sicily; and required  every one who had taken the cross against the infidels, or had vowed to  advance money for that service, to support the war against Mainfroy, a  more terrible enemy, as he pretended, to the Christian faith than  any Saracen.[**] He levied a tenth on all ecclesiastical benefices in  England for three years; and gave orders to excommunicate all bishops  who made not punctual payment. He granted to the king the goods of  intestate clergymen; the revenues of vacant benefices, the revenues of  all non-residents.[***] But these taxations, being levied by some rule,  were deemed less grievous than another imposition, which arose from the  suggestion of the bishop of Hereford, and which might have opened the  door to endless and intolerable abuses.    This prelate, who resided at the court of Rome by a deputation from  the English church, drew bills of different values but amounting on the  whole to a hundred and fifty thousand five hundred and forty marks on  all the bishops and abbots of the kingdom; and granted these bills to  Italian merchants, who, it was pretended, had advanced money for the  service of the war against Mainfroy.[****] As there was no likelihood  of the English prelates' submitting, without compulsion, to such an  extraordinary demand, Rustand the legate was charged with the commission  of employing authority to that purpose, and he summoned an assembly of  the bishops and abbots whom he acquainted with the pleasure of the pope  and of the king.
