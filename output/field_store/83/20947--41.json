[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#6)"],[1,"Detective-Inspector Dunbar arrived at New Scotland Yard in a veritable  fever of excitement. Jumping out of the cab he ran into the building  and without troubling the man in charge of the lift went straight on  upstairs to his room. He found it to be in darkness and switched on  the green-shaded lamp which was suspended above the table. Its light  revealed a bare apartment having distempered walls severely decorated  by an etching of a former and unbeautiful Commissioner. The blinds  were drawn. A plain, heavy deal table (bearing a blotting-pad, a  pewter ink-pot, several pens and a telephone), together with three  uncomfortable chairs, alone broke the expanse of highly polished  floor. Dunbar glanced at the table and then stood undecided in the  middle of the bare room, tapping his small, widely separated teeth  with a pencil which he had absently drawn from his waistcoat pocket.  He rang the bell.    A constable came in almost immediately and stood waiting just inside  the door.    \"When did Sergeant Sowerby leave?\" asked Dunbar.    \"About three hours ago, sir.\"    \"What!\" cried Dunbar. \"Three hours ago! But I have been here myself  within that time--in the Commissioner's office.\"    \"Sergeant Sowerby left before then. I saw him go.\"    \"But, my good fellow, he has been back again. He spoke to me on the  telephone less than a quarter of an hour ago.\"    \"Not from here, sir.\"    \"But I say it _was_ from here!\" shouted Dunbar fiercely; \"and I told  him to wait for me.\"    \"Very good, sir. Shall I make inquiries?\"    \"Yes. Wait a minute. Is the Commissioner here?\"    \"Yes, sir, I believe so. At least I have not seen him go.\"    \"Find Sergeant Sowerby and tell him to wait here for me,\" snapped  Dunbar.    He walked out into the bare corridor and along to the room of the  Assistant Commissioner. Knocking upon the door, he opened it  immediately, and entered an apartment which afforded a striking  contrast to his own. For whereas the room of Inspector Dunbar was  practically unfurnished, that of his superior was so filled with  tables, cupboards, desks, bureaux, files, telephones, bookshelves  and stacks of documents that one only discovered the Assistant  Commissioner sunk deep in a padded armchair and a cloud of tobacco  smoke by dint of close scrutiny. The Assistant Commissioner was small,  sallow and satanic. His black moustache was very black and his eyes  were of so dark a brown as to appear black also. When he smiled he  revealed a row of very large white teeth, and his smile was correctly  Mephistophelean. He smoked a hundred and twenty Egyptian cigarettes  per diem, and the first and second fingers of either hand were  coffee-coloured.    \"Good-evening, Inspector,\" he said courteously. \"You come at an  opportune moment.\" He lighted a fresh cigarette. \"I was detained here  unusually late to-night or this news would not have reached us till  the morning.\" He laid his finger upon a yellow form. \"There is an  unpleasant development in 'The Scorpion' case.\"    \"So I gather, sir. That is what brought me back to the Yard.\"    The Assistant Commissioner glanced up sharply.    \"What brought you back to the Yard?\" he asked.    \"The news about Max.\"    The assistant Commissioner leaned back in his chair. \"Might I ask,  Inspector,\" he said, \"what news you have learned and how you have  learned it?\"    Dunbar stared uncomprehendingly.    \"Sowerby 'phoned me about half an hour ago, sir. Did he do so without  your instructions?\"    \"Most decidedly. What was his message?\"    \"He told me,\" replied Dunbar, in ever-growing amazement, \"that the  body brought in by the River Police last night had been identified  as that of Gaston Max.\"    The Assistant Commissioner handed a pencilled slip to Dunbar. It read  as follows:--    \"Gaston Max in London. Scorpion, Narcombe. No report since 30th ult.  Fear trouble. Identity-disk G. M. 49685.\"    \"But, sir,\" said Dunbar--\"this is exactly what Sowerby told me!\"    \"Quite so. That is the really extraordinary feature of the affair.  Because, you see, Inspector, I only finished decoding this message  at the very moment that you knocked at my door!\"    \"But----\"    \"There is no room for a 'but,' Inspector. This confidential message  from Paris reached me ten minutes ago. You know as well as I know that  there is no possibility of leakage. No one has entered my room in the  interval, yet you tell me that Sergeant Sowerby communicated this  information to you, by telephone, half an hour ago.\"    Dunbar was tapping his teeth with the pencil. His amazement was too  great for words.    \"Had the message been a false one,\" continued the Commissioner, \"the  matter would have been resolved into a meaningless hoax, but the  message having been what it was, we find ourselves face to face with  no ordinary problem. Remember, Inspector, that voices on the telephone  are deceptive. Sergeant Sowerby has marked vocal mannerisms----\"    \"Which would be fairly easy to imitate? Yes, sir--that's so.\"    \"But it brings us no nearer to the real problems; viz., first, the  sender of the message; and, second, his purpose.\"    There was a dull purring sound and the Assistant Commissioner raised  the telephone.    \"Yes. Who is it that wishes to speak to him? Dr. Keppel Stuart?  Connect with my office.\"    He turned again to Dunbar.    \"Dr. Stuart has a matter of the utmost urgency to communicate,  Inspector. It was at the house of Dr. Stuart, I take it, that you  received the unexplained message?\"    \"It was--yes.\"    \"Did you submit to Dr. Stuart the broken gold ornament?\"    \"Yes. It's a scorpion's tail.\"    \"Ah!\" The Assistant Commissioner smiled satanically and lighted a  fresh cigarette. \"And is Dr. Stuart agreeable to placing his unusual  knowledge at our disposal for the purposes of this case?\"    \"He is, sir.\"    The purring sound was repeated.    \"You are through to Dr. Stuart,\" said the Assistant Commissioner.    \"Hullo\" cried Dunbar, taking up the receiver--\"is that Dr. Stuart?  Dunbar speaking.\"    He stood silent for a while, listening to the voice over the wires.  Then: \"You want me to come around now, doctor? Very well. I'll be  with you in less than half an hour.\"    He put down the instrument.    \"Something extraordinary seems to have taken place at Dr. Stuart's  house a few minutes after I left, sir,\" he said. \"I'm going back  there, now, for particulars. It sounds as though the 'phone message  might have been intended to get me away.\" He stared down at the  pencilled slip which the Assistant Commissioner had handed him, but  stared vacantly, and: \"Do you mind if I call someone up, sir?\" he  asked. \"It should be done at once.\"    \"Call by all means, Inspector.\"    Dunbar again took up the telephone.    \"Battersea 0996,\" he said, and stood waiting. Then:    \"Is that Battersea 0996?\" he asked. \"Is Dr. Stuart there? He is  speaking? Oh, this is Inspector Dunbar. You called me up here at the  Yard a few moments ago, did you not? Correct, doctor; that's all I  wanted to know. I am coming now.\"    \"Good,\" said the Assistant Commissioner, nodding his approval. \"You  will have to check 'phone messages in that way until you have run your  mimic to earth, Inspector. I don't believe for a moment that it was  Sergeant Sowerby who rang you up at Dr. Stuart's.\"    \"Neither do I,\" said Dunbar grimly. \"But I begin to have a glimmer of  a notion who it was. I'll be saying good-night, sir. Dr. Stuart seems  to have something very important to tell me.\"    As a mere matter of form he waited for the report of the constable who  had gone in quest of Sowerby, but it merely confirmed the fact that  Sowerby had left Scotland Yard over three hours earlier. Dunbar  summoned a taxicab and proceeded to the house of Dr. Stuart.        CHAPTER VII    CONTENTS OF THE SEALED ENVELOPE      Stuart personally admitted Dunbar, and once more the Inspector found  himself in the armchair in the study. The fire was almost out and the  room seemed to be chilly. Stuart was labouring under the influence of  suppressed excitement and was pacing restlessly up and down the floor.    \"Inspector,\" he began, \"I find it difficult to tell you the facts which  have recently come to my knowledge bearing upon this most mysterious  'Scorpion' case. I clearly perceive, now, that without being aware of  the fact I have nevertheless been concerned in the case for at least  a week.\"    Dunbar stared surprisedly, but offered no comment.    \"A fortnight ago,\" Stuart continued, \"I found myself in the  neighbourhood of the West India Docks. I had been spending the evening  with a very old friend, chief officer of a liner in dock. I had  intended to leave the ship at about ten o'clock and to walk to the  railway station, but, as it fell out, the party did not break up until  after midnight. Declining the offer of a berth on board, I came ashore  determined to make my way home by tram and afoot. I should probably  have done so and have been spared--much; but rain began to fall  suddenly and I found myself, foolishly unprovided with a top-coat, in  those grey East End streets without hope of getting a lift.    \"It was just as I was crossing Limehouse Causeway that I observed, to  my astonishment, the head-lamps of a cab or car shining out from a dark  and forbidding thoroughfare which led down to the river. The sight was  so utterly unexpected that I paused, looking through the rainy mist in  the direction of the stationary vehicle. I was still unable to make  out if it were a cab or a car, and accordingly I walked along to where  it stood and found that it was a taxicab and apparently for hire.    \"'Are you disengaged?' I said to the man.  \"'Well, sir, I suppose I am,' was his curious reply. 'Where do you  want to go?'    \"I gave him this address and he drove me home. On arriving, so  grateful did I feel that I took pity upon the man, for it had settled  down into a brute of a night, and asked him to come in and take a  glass of grog. He was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#6)"],[1,"or.\" Nor, continues Locke, is this  \"undoubted prerogative\" ever questioned, \"for the people are very seldom  or never scrupulous or nice in the point\" whilst the prerogative \"is in  any tolerable degree employed for the use it was meant, that is, for the  good of the people.\"[37] A parallel ambivalence pervades both practice  and adjudication under the Constitution from the beginning.    The opening clause of Article II of the Constitution reads: \"The  executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of  America\". The primary purpose of this clause, which made its appearance  late in the Convention and was never separately passed upon by it, was  to settle the question whether the executive branch should be plural or  single; a secondary purpose was to give the President a title. There is  no hint in the published records that the clause was supposed to add  cubits to the succeeding clauses which recite the President's powers and  duties in detail.    For all that, the \"executive power\" clause was invoked as a grant of  power in the first Congress to assemble under the Constitution, and  outside Congress in 1793. On the former occasion Madison and others  advanced the contention that the clause empowered the President to  remove without the Senate's consent all executive officers, even those  appointed with that consent, and in effect this view prevailed, to be  ratified by the Supreme Court 137 years later in the famous Oregon  Postmaster Case.[38]    In 1793 the protagonist of \"executive power\" was Alexander Hamilton, who  appealed to the clause in defense of Washington's proclamation of  neutrality, issued on the outbreak of war between France and Great  Britain. Prompted by Jefferson to take up his pen and \"cut him to pieces  in face of public,\" Madison shifted position, and charged Hamilton with  endeavoring to smuggle the prerogative of the King of Great Britain into  the Constitution via the \"executive power\" clause.[39] Three years  earlier Jefferson had himself written in an official opinion as  Secretary of State: [The Executive branch of the government],  \"possessing the rights of self-government from nature, cannot be  controlled in the exercise of them but by a law, passed in the forms of  the Constitution\".[40]    This time judicial endorsement of the broad conception of the executive  power came early. In laying the foundation in Marbury _v._ Madison for  the Court's claim of power to pass on the constitutionality of acts of  Congress, Marshall said: \"The government of the United States has been  emphatically termed a government of laws and not of men\".[41] Two pages  along he added these words:         By the constitution of the United States, the President is       invested with certain important political powers, in the       exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is       accountable only to his country in his political character,       and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance of       these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers,       who act by his authority and in conformity with his orders.         In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion       may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion       may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to       control that discretion. The subjects are political. They       respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted       to the executive, the decision of the executive is       conclusive.[42]    From these words arises the doctrine of Political Questions, an escape  clause from the trammels of judicial review for high executive officers  in the performance of their discretionary duties. The doctrine was  continued, even expanded, by Marshall's successor. In Luther _v._  Borden,[43] decided in 1849, the Court was invited to review the  determination by the President that the existing government of Rhode  Island was \"republican\" in form. It declined the invitation, holding  that the decision of Congress and of the President as Congress's  delegate was final in the matter, and bound the courts. Otherwise said  Chief Justice Taney, the guarantee clause of the Constitution (Article  IV, section 4) \"is a guarantee of anarchy and not of order\". But a year  later the same Chief Justice, speaking again for the unanimous Court,  did not hesitate to rule that the President's powers as  commander-in-chief were purely military in character, those of any top  general or top admiral.[44] Hamilton had said the same thing in  Federalist No. 69.    Alongside the opinions of the Court of this period, however, stand  certain opinions of Attorneys General that yield a less balanced bill of  fare. For it is the case that, from the first down to the present year  of grace, these family lawyers of the Administration in power have  tended to favor expansive conceptions of presidential prerogative. As  early as 1831 we find an Attorney-General arguing before the Supreme  Court that, in performance of the trust enjoined upon him by the  \"faithful execution\" clause, the President \"not only may, but ... is  bound to avail himself of every appropriate means not forbidden by  law.\"[45] Especially noteworthy is a series of opinions handed down by  Attorney-General Cushing in the course of the years 1853 to 1855. In one  of these the Attorney-General laid down the doctrine that a marshal of  the United States, when opposed in the execution of his duty by unlawful  combinations too powerful to be dealt with by the ordinary processes of  a federal court, had authority to summon the entire able-bodied force of  his precinct as a _posse comitatus_, comprising not only bystanders and  citizens generally but any and all armed forces,[46] which is precisely  the theory upon which Lincoln based his call for volunteers in April,  1861.    Also manifest is the debt of Lincoln's message of July 4, 1861, to these  opinions. Here in so many words the President lays claim to \"the war  power\", partly on the ground of his duty to \"take care that the laws be  faithfully executed\", partly in reliance on his powers as  Commander-in-Chief, incidentally furnishing thereby a formula which has  frequently reappeared in opinions of Attorneys-General in recent years.  Nor did Lincoln ever relinquish the belief that on the one ground or the  other he possessed extraordinary resources of power which Congress  lacked and the exercise of which it could not control--an idea in the  conscientious pursuit of which his successor came to the verge of utter  disaster.    When first confronted with Lincoln's theory in the Prize Cases,[47] in  the midst of war, a closely divided Court treated it with abundant  indulgence; but in _Ex parte_ Milligan[48] another closely divided Court  swung violently to the other direction, adopting the comfortable  position that the normal powers of the government were perfectly  adequate to any emergency that could possibly arise, and citing the war  just \"happily terminated\" in proof. But once again the principle of  equilibrium asserted itself. Five months after Milligan, the same Bench  held unanimously in Mississippi _v._ Johnson[49] that the President is  not accountable to any court save that of impeachment either for the  nonperformance of his constitutional duties or for the exceeding of his  constitutional powers.    This was in the 1866-1867 term of Court. Sixteen years later, in 1882,  Justice Samuel Miller gave classic expression to the principle of \"a  government of laws and not of men\" in these words: \"No man is so high  that he is above the law.... All officers are creatures of the law and  are bound to obey it.\"[50] Eight years later this same great Judge  queried whether the President's duty to take care that the laws be  faithfully executed is \"limited to the enforcement of acts of Congress  or of treaties according to their express terms,\" whether it did not  also embrace \"the rights, duties, and obligations growing out of the  Constitution itself ... and all the protection implied by the nature of  the government under the Constitution.\"[51] Then in 1895, in the Debs  Case,[52] the Court sustained unanimously the right of the National  Executive to go into the federal courts and secure an injunction against  striking railway employees who were interfering with interstate  commerce, although it was conceded that there was no statutory basis for  such action. The opinion of the Court extends the logic of the holding  to any widespread public interest.    The great accession to presidential power in recent decades has been  accompanied by the breakdown dealt with earlier of the two great  structural principles of the American Constitutional System, the  doctrine of Dual Federalism and the doctrine of the Separation of  Powers. The first exponent of \"the New Presidency\", as some termed it,  was Theodore Roosevelt, who tells us in his _Autobiography_ that the  principle which governed him in his exercise of the presidential office  was that he had not only a right but a duty \"to do anything that the  needs of the Nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the  Constitution or by the laws.\"[53] In his book, _Our Chief Magistrate and  his Powers_, Ex-President Taft warmly protested against the notion that  the President has any constitutional warrant to attempt the role of a  \"Universal Providence.\"[54] A decade earlier his destined successor,  Woodrow Wilson, had avowed the opinion that \"the President is at  liberty, both in law and conscience, to be as big a man as he can\".[55]    But it is the second Roosevelt who beyond all twentieth-century  Presidents succeeded in affixing the stamp both of personality and of  crisis upon the Presidency as it exists at this moment. In the solution  of the problems of an economic crisis, \"a crisis greater than war\", he  claimed for the National Government in general, and for the President"]]]
