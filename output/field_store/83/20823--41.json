I have given you merely the views of an \"outsider,\" who has had a  somewhat extensive experience in stationary engineering, and who has  observed locomotive practice in many parts of the world. These views  are offered for what they are worth, as suggestions for future thought  in designing engines, and as a sort of refresher upon rudimentary  points which long familiarity with every-day phenomena causes us at  times to overlook. I trust that your deliberations may aid in the  speedy reduction of the expenses of transporting freight and  passengers, for the benefit of the railroad companies and, in their  turn, the advantage of the people at large.           *       *       *       *       *          ATLANTIC STEAMERS.[1]      [Footnote 1: A paper recently read before the Institution of Naval    Architects.]    By W. JOHN.      [Illustration: Fig. 1--CITY OF ROME.]    The author said that he hoped to bring before the meeting impartially  certain facts which might be of interest, and which, when recorded in  the pages of the \"Transactions,\" might be found of some use as data  for future reference. In dealing with passenger steamers, he would do  so principally from a shipbuilder's point of view; but the moment he  commenced to think over Atlantic passenger ships as a shipbuilder, he  was met by the question whether the present tendency toward divorcing  the passenger and cargo trade from each other is likely to continue or  not. If the answer is yes, then it seems to become an important  question, for the present at least, how to build, on moderately small  dimensions, the fastest, safest, and most economical passenger  steamer, using all the most modern improvements to make her commodious  and luxurious, and an easy sea boat into the bargain. If cargo is  still to be carried in the passenger ships of the future, a moderate  speed only will be aimed at in the immediate future, and every effort  will be devoted to economy of fuel, comfort, and safety, with a fair  carrying capacity. This latter policy is one which may possibly  prevail at least for a time, as it has powerful supporters in  Liverpool; but he could not help thinking that very high  speeds--higher than we have yet attained--must eventually gain the  day. He also thought that they were on the eve of important movements,  which will indicate what the next step in the passenger trade is to  be; for it must be remembered, among other things, that none of our  present English transatlantic liners, even the latest, have yet been  fitted with the latest modern improvements for economy of fuel or  quick combustion, such as triple expansion engines or forced draught.  They must, therefore, be at some disadvantage, other things being  equal, compared with the ships of the future possessing them. The  Great Eastern steaming up Milford Haven about twenty-five years ago  between two lines of the channel fleet of old--two and three decked  wooden line-of-battle ships--the whole fleet saluting with yards  manned, was a sight to be remembered. More than this, that ship, with  all her mournful career, has been a useful lesson and a useful warning  to all naval architects who seriously study their profession--a lesson  of what can be done in the safe construction of huge floating  structures, and a warning that the highest flights of constructive  genius may prove abortive if not strictly subordinated to the  practical conditions and commercial requirements of the times. The  Sirius and Great Western crossed the Atlantic in 1838, and in 1840 the  first ship of the since celebrated Cunard Company made her first  voyage. This was the Britannia, which, with her sister ships, the  Arcadia, Caledonia, and Columbia, kept up the mail service regularly  at a speed of about 81/2 knots an hour. The Britannia was 207 ft. in  length between perpendiculars, and 34 ft. 4 in. extreme breadth, 22  ft. 6 in. depth of hold, 423 horse power--nominal--and 1,153 tons  burden, built of wood, and propelled by paddles. In 1860 the Collins  Line started in opposition to the Cunard, and, after a series of  disasters, collapsed in 1858. This was three years after the Persia,  the first Cunarder built of iron, had been completed. In 1850, also,  the Inman Line was started with the City of Glasgow, of 1,600 tons  builders' measurement, and 350 horse power. She was built of iron, and  was the first screw steamer sent across the Atlantic from Liverpool  with passengers, and was the pioneer of the great emigrant trade which  Mr. Inman, above all others, did so much to develop and make cheap and  comfortable for the emigrants themselves, as well as profitable to his  company. That the builders of the celebrated old Great Britain, in  1843, and Mr. Inman, in 1850, should have pronounced so decisively in  favor of the screw propeller in preference to the paddle for ocean  steaming is a proof of their true practical judgment, which time and  practical experience have made abundantly clear. While the Cunard  Company went on developing its fleet from the early wood paddle  steamer Britannia of 1,130 tons in 1840 to the iron paddle steamers  Persia, etc., in 1858, the iron screw steamer China of 1862, to the  still more important screw steamers Bothnia and Scythia, vessels of  4,335 tons, in 1874, the Inman and other lines were as rapidly  developing in speed and size, if not in numbers. The year 1874 is  memorable, for it saw the White Star steamers Britannic and Germanic  put into the water, as well as the Inman steamer City of Berlin and  the two before mentioned Cunard steamers, Bothnia and Scythia. By the  addition of these two ships to their fleet the White Star Line,  although started only in 1870, reached a front rank position in the  New York passenger trade. The author gave in separate tables the logs  of several of these ships, some from published documents and some  kindly furnished by the owners. The Great Western had crossed the  Atlantic from Bristol to New York in 15 days as early as 1838. The  first Cunard steamer, the Britannic, was about the same speed, from 81/4  to 81/2 knots an hour. The average duration of the Cunard voyages in the  year 1856 was 12.67 days from Liverpool to New York, and 11.03 days  from New York to Liverpool. The Bothnia, in 1874, reduced the passage  to about nine days. The White Star Britannic, in 1876, averaged 7 days  18 hours 26 minutes outward from Queenstown to New York, and 9 days 6  hours 44 minutes homeward, and has averaged for the last ten years 8  days 9 hours 36 minutes outward, and 8 days 1 hour 48 minutes  homeward. The City of Berlin, of the Inman Line, also built in 1874, 8  days 10 hours 56 minutes, and homeward 8 days 2 hours 37 minutes; and  for the nine years from 1875 to 1883 inclusive, averaged outward 8  days 19 hours 56 seconds, and inward 8 days 8 hours 34 seconds; or,  putting it into rounder figures, the Britannic had reduced the average  passage between the two points to 81/4 days, and the City of Berlin to  81/2 days. From the year 1874 on to 1879 no further advance was made in  Atlantic steaming, but in that year the Arizona was added to the Guion  Line, and it soon became evident that another important stride had  been made in the Atlantic passenger trade, which would lead to most  important results. The results, as we all know, have been sufficiently  startling. The Guion Line, which had started in 1866 with the  Manhattan, had now the fastest passenger ship on the Atlantic. In  spite of burning some fifty per cent. more coal than the Britannic,  the ship was an obvious commercial success. The spirited policy which  brought her into existence was appreciated by the public, and the  other lines had to move forward. Then followed a period of rivalry,  the Cunard Company building the Gallia and Servia, the Inman Company  the City of Rome, and the Guion Line the Alaska, all of which were  completed in 1881, and afterward the Oregon for the Guion  Line--1883--the Aurania the same year for the Cunard Company, and,  later still, the America for the National Line, and the Umbria and  Etruria for the Cunard Company in 1885.

Taking the Britannic as a standard with  her ten years' average of 81/4 days across, and her quickest passage of  7 days 10 hours 53 seconds, we have now the following steamers of  higher speeds. Taking them in the order of their absolutely fastest  passage out or home, they stand thus:      TABLE I.      ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------       |                         | Days.| Hours.| Mins.       |                         +------+-------+------     1 | Etruria.                |   6  |   5   |  31     2 | Umbria (sister ship).   |   slightly longer.     3 | Oregon.                 |   6  |  10   |  35     4 | America.                |   6  |  13   |  44     5 | City of Rome.           |   6  |  18   |   0     6 | Alaska.                 |   6  |  18   |  37     7 | Servia.                 |   6  |  23   |  55     8 | Aurania.                |   7  |   1   |   1    ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------    It will thus be seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#6)"],[1,"two of his battalions the Brigadier  checked the advance of this column and relieved the pressure on the  Second Division. From this period until late in the afternoon the  fighting consisted of a series of attacks and counter-attacks. The  counter-strokers by the enemy were delivered at first with great vigor,  but later on they decreased in strength, and all were driven off with  heavy loss.    On the left the Sixth Infantry Brigade had been ordered to cross the  river and to pass through the line held during the preceding night by  the Fifth Infantry Brigade and occupy the Courtecon Ridge, while a  detached force, consisting of the Fourth Guards Brigade and the  Thirty-sixth Brigade Royal Field Artillery, under Brig. Gen. Perceval,  were ordered to proceed to a point east of the village of Ostel.    The Sixth Infantry Brigade crossed the river at Pont-Arcy, moved up the  valley toward Braye, and at 9 A.M. had reached the line  Tilleul-La-Buvelle. On the line they came under heavy artillery and  rifle fire, and were unable to advance until supported by the  Thirty-fourth Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, and the Forty-fourth  Howitzer Brigade and the Heavy Artillery.    The Fourth Guards Brigade crossed the river at 10 A.M. and met with very  heavy opposition. It had to pass through dense woods; field artillery  support was difficult to obtain; but one section of a field battery  pushed up to and within the firing line. At 1 P.M. the left of the  brigade was south of the Ostel Ridge.    At this period of the action the enemy obtained a footing between the  First and Second Corps, and threatened to cut the communications of the  latter.    Sir Douglas Haig was very hardly pressed and had no reserve in hand. I  placed the cavalry division at his disposal, part of which he skillfully  used to prolong and secure the left flank of the Guards Brigade. Some  heavy fighting ensued, which resulted in the enemy being driven back  with heavy loss.    About 4 o'clock the weakening of the counter-attacks by the enemy and  other indications tended to show that his resistance was decreasing, and  a general advance was ordered by the army corps commander. Although  meeting with considerable opposition and coming under very heavy  artillery and rifle fire, the position of the corps at the end of the  day's operations extended from the Chemin-des-Dames on the right,  through Chivy, to Le Cour de Soupir, with the First Cavalry Brigade  extending to the Chavonne-Soissons road.    [Illustration: Map 9.--Sept. 13 and 14. Passage of the Aisne, when  bridges were constructed under great difficulties.]    On the right the corps was in close touch with the French Moroccan  troops of the Eighteenth Corps, which were intrenched in echelon to its  right rear. During the night they intrenched this position.    Throughout the battle of the Aisne this advanced and commanding position  was maintained, and I cannot speak too highly of the valuable services  rendered by Sir Douglas Haig and the army corps under his command. Day  after day and night after night the enemy's infantry has been hurled  against him in violent counter-attack, which has never on any one  occasion succeeded, while the trenches all over his position have been  under continuous heavy artillery fire.    The operations of the First Corps on this day resulted in the capture of  several hundred prisoners, some field pieces and machine guns.    The casualties were very severe, one brigade alone losing three of its  four Colonels.    The Third Division commenced a further advance, and had nearly reached  the plateau of Aizy when they were driven back by a powerful  counter-attack supported by heavy artillery. The division, however, fell  back in the best order, and finally intrenched itself about a mile north  of Vailly Bridge, effectively covering the passage.    The Fourth and Fifth Divisions were unable to do more than maintain  their ground.    5. On the morning of the 15th, after close examination of the position,  it became clear to me that the enemy was making a determined stand; and  this view was confirmed by reports which reached me from the French  armies fighting on my right and left, which clearly showed that a  strongly intrenched line of defense was being taken up from the north of  Compiegne, eastward and southeastward, along the whole Valley of the  Aisne up to and beyond Rheims.    A few days previously the Fortress of Maubeuge fell, and a considerable  quantity of siege artillery was brought down from that place to  strengthen the enemy's position in front of us.    During the 15th shells fell in our position which have been judged by  experts to be thrown by eight-inch siege guns with a range of 10,000  yards. Throughout the whole course of the battle our troops have  suffered very heavily from this fire, although its effect latterly was  largely mitigated by more efficient and thorough intrenching, the  necessity for which I impressed strongly upon army corps commanders. In  order to assist them in this work all villages within the area of our  occupation were searched for heavy intrenching tools, a large number of  which were collected.    In view of the peculiar formation of the ground on the north side of the  river between Missy and Soissons, and its extraordinary adaptability to  a force on the defensive, the Fifth Division found it impossible to  maintain its position on the southern edge of the Chivres Plateau, as  the enemy in possession of the Village of Vregny to the west was able to  bring a flank fire to bear upon it. The division had, therefore, to  retire to a line the left of which was at the village of Marguerite, and  thence ran by the north edge of Missy back to the river to the east of  that place.    With great skill and tenacity Sir Charles Fergusson maintained this  position throughout the whole battle, although his trenches were  necessarily on lower ground than that occupied by the enemy on the  southern edge of the plateau, which was only 400 yards away.    Gen. Hamilton with the Third Division vigorously attacked to the north,  and regained all the ground he had lost on the 15th, which throughout  the battle has formed a most powerful and effective bridge-head.    6. On the 16th the Sixth Division came up into line.    It had been my intention to direct the First Corps to attack and seize  the enemy's position on the Chemin-des-Dames, supporting it with this  new reinforcement. I hoped, from the position thus gained, to bring  effective fire to bear across the front of the Third Division, which,  by securing the advance of the latter, would also take the pressure off  the Fifth Division and the Third Corps.    But any further advance of the First Corps would have dangerously  exposed my right flank. And, further, I learned from the French  Commander in Chief that he was strongly reinforcing the Sixth French  Army on my left, with the intention of bringing up the allied left to  attack the enemy's flank, and thus compel his retirement. I therefore  sent the Sixth Division to join the Third Corps, with orders to keep it  on the south side of the river, as it might be available in general  reserve.    On the 17th, 18th, and 19th the whole of our line was heavily bombarded,  and the First Corps was constantly and heavily engaged. On the afternoon  of the 17th the right flank of the First Division was seriously  threatened. A counter-attack was made by the Northamptonshire Regiment  in combination with the Queen's, and one battalion of the Divisional  Reserve was moved up in support. The Northamptonshire Regiment, under  cover of mist, crept up to within a hundred yards of the enemy's  trenches and charged with the bayonet, driving them out of the trenches  and up the hill. A very strong force of hostile infantry was then  disclosed on the crest line. This new line was enfiladed by part of the  Queen's and the King's Royal Rifles, which wheeled to their left on the  extreme right of our infantry line, and were supported by a squadron of  cavalry on their outer flank. The enemy's attack was ultimately driven  back with heavy loss.    On the 18th, during the night, the Gloucestershire Regiment advanced  from their position near Chivy, filled in the enemy's trenches, and  captured two Maxim guns.    On the extreme right the Queen's were heavily attacked, but the enemy  was repulsed with great loss. About midnight the attack was renewed on  the First Division, supported by artillery fire, but was again  repulsed.    Shortly after midnight an attack was made on the left of the Second  Division with considerable force, which was also thrown back.    At about 1 P.M. on the 19th the Second Division drove back a heavy  infantry attack strongly supported by artillery fire. At dusk the attack  was renewed and again repulsed.    On the 18th I discussed with the General Officer commanding the Second  Army Corps and his divisional commanders the possibility of driving the  enemy out of Conde, which lay between his two divisions, and seizing the  bridge, which has remained throughout in his possession.    As, however, I found that the bridge was closely commanded from all  points on the south side, and that satisfactory arrangements were made  to prevent any issue from it by the enemy by day or night, I decided  that it was not necessary to incur the losses which an attack would  entail, as, in view of the position of the Second and Third Corps, the  enemy could make no use of Conde, and would be automatically forced out  of it by any advance which might become possible for us.    7. On this day information reached me from Gen. Joffre that he had found  it necessary to make a new plan and to attack and envelop the German  right flank.    It was now evident to me that the battle in which we had been engaged  since the 12th inst. must last some days longer, until the effect of  this new flank movement could be felt and a way opened to drive the"]]]
