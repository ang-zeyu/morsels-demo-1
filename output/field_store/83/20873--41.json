The mourners did  not go about the streets,[37] indeed; for nobody put on black, or made a  formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends: but the voice of  mourning was truly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and  children at the windows and doors of their houses, where their nearest  relations were perhaps dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard  as we passed the streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest  heart in the world to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost  in every house, especially in the first part of the visitation; for  towards the latter end, men's hearts were hardened, and death was so  always before their eyes that they did not so much concern themselves  for the loss of their friends, expecting that themselves should be  summoned the next hour.    Business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even when  the sickness was chiefly there. And as the thing was new to me, as well  as to everybody else, it was a most surprising thing to see those  streets, which were usually so thronged, now grown desolate, and so few  people to be seen in them, that if I had been a stranger, and at a loss  for my way, I might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street, I  mean of the by-streets, and see[38] nobody to direct me, except watchmen  set at the doors of such houses as were shut up; of which I shall speak  presently.    One day, being at that part of the town on some special business,  curiosity led me to observe things more than usually; and indeed I  walked a great way where I had no business. I went up Holborn, and there  the street was full of people; but they walked in the middle of the  great street, neither on one side or[39] other, because, as I suppose,  they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses, or meet with  smells and scents from houses, that might be infected.    The inns of court were all shut up, nor were very many of the lawyers in  the Temple,[40] or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn, to be seen there.  Everybody was at peace, there was no occasion for lawyers; besides, it  being in the time of the vacation too, they were generally gone into the  country. Whole rows of houses in some places were shut close up, the  inhabitants all fled, and only a watchman or two left.    When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut up by  the magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed the court,  by the necessity of their employments, and other dependencies; and as  others retired, really frighted with the distemper, it was a mere  desolating of some of the streets. But the fright was not yet near so  great in the city, abstractedly so called,[41] and particularly because,  though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation, yet, as  I have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first, so they  were, as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several times,  till it began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared  violent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or the  east or south parts, the people began to take courage, and to be, as I  may say, a little hardened. It is true, a vast many people fled, as I  have observed; yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town, and  from that we call the heart of the city, that is to say, among the  wealthiest of the people, and such persons as were unincumbered with  trades and business. But of the rest, the generality staid, and seemed  to abide the worst; so that in the place we call the liberties, and in  the suburbs, in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping,  Ratcliff, Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally  staid, except here and there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did  not depend upon their business.    It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously  full of people at the time of this visitation, I mean at the time that  it began. For though I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty  throngs of people settling in London, more than ever; yet we had always  a notion that numbers of people which--the wars being over, the armies  disbanded, and the royal family and the monarchy being restored--had  flocked to London to settle in business, or to depend upon and attend  the court for rewards of services, preferments, and the like, was[42]  such that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand  people more than ever it held before. Nay, some took upon them to say  it had twice as many, because all the ruined families of the royal party  flocked hither, all the soldiers set up trades here, and abundance of  families settled here. Again: the court brought with it a great flux of  pride and new fashions; all people were gay and luxurious, and the joy  of the restoration had brought a vast many families to London.[43]    But I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time. While  the fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by  several odd accidents, which put altogether, it was really a wonder the  whole body of the people did not rise as one man, and abandon their  dwellings, leaving the place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for  an Aceldama,[44] doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and  that all that would be found in it would perish with it. I shall name  but a few of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many  wizards and cunning people propagating them, that I have often wondered  there was any (women especially) left behind.    In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several months  before the plague, as there did, the year after, another a little before  the fire. The old women, and the phlegmatic hypochondriac[45] part of  the other sex (whom I could almost call old women too), remarked,  especially afterward, though not till both those judgments were over,  that those two comets passed directly over the city, and that so very  near the houses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to  the city alone; that the comet before the pestilence was of a faint,  dull, languid color, and its motion very heavy, solemn, and slow, but  that the comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as others  said, flaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that, accordingly,  one foretold a heavy judgment, slow but severe, terrible, and  frightful, as was the plague, but the other foretold a stroke, sudden,  swift, and fiery, as was the conflagration. Nay, so particular some  people were, that, as they looked upon that comet preceding the fire,  they fancied that they not only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and  could perceive the motion with their eye, but even they heard it; that  it made a rushing, mighty noise, fierce and terrible, though at a  distance, and but just perceivable.    I saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had had so much of the  common notion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look upon  them as the forerunners and warnings of God's judgments, and, especially  when the plague had followed the first, I yet saw another of the like  kind, I could not but say, God had not yet sufficiently scourged the  city.    The apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the  error of the times, in which I think the people, from what principle I  cannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies, and astrological  conjurations, dreams, and old wives' tales, than ever they were before  or since.[46] Whether this unhappy temper was originally raised by the  follies of some people who got money by it, that is to say, by printing  predictions and prognostications, I know not. But certain it is, books  frighted them terribly, such as \"Lilly's Almanack,\"[47] \"Gadbury's  Astrological Predictions,\" \"Poor Robin's Almanack,\"[48] and the like;  also several pretended religious books,--one entitled \"Come out of Her,  my People, lest ye be Partaker of her Plagues;\"[49] another called \"Fair  Warning;\" another, \"Britain's Remembrancer;\" and many such,--all, or  most part of which, foretold directly or covertly the ruin of the city.  Nay, some were so enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with  their oral predictions, pretending they were sent to preach to the city;  and one in particular, who, like Jonah[50] to Nineveh, cried in the  streets, \"Yet forty days, and London shall be destroyed.\" I will not be  positive whether he said \"yet forty days,\" or \"yet a few days.\" Another  ran about naked, except a pair of drawers about his waist, crying day  and night, like a man that Josephus[51] mentions, who cried, \"Woe to  Jerusalem!\" a little before the destruction of that city: so this poor  naked creature cried, \"Oh, the great and the dreadful God!\" and said no  more, but repeated those words continually, with a voice and countenance  full of horror, a swift pace, and nobody could ever find him to stop, or  rest, or take any sustenance, at least that ever I could hear of. I met  this poor creature several times in the streets, and would have spoke to  him, but he would not enter into speech with me, or any one else, but  kept on his dismal cries continually.    These things terrified the people to the last degree, and especially  when two or three times, as I have mentioned already, they found one or  two in the bills dead of the plague at St. Giles's.    Next to these public things were the dreams of old women; or, I should  say, the interpretation of old women upon other people's dreams; and  these put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices  warning them to be gone, for that there would be such a plague in London  so that the living would not be able to bury the dead; others saw  apparitions in the air: and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope  without breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and  saw sights that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#6)"],[1,"without your rifle! And a  revolver, too--be sure that it is in perfect condition. And--have you  a knife? You're so LITTLE!\" she wailed. \"But father will need you, and  he'll take care of you--and Colorou would not let you be hurt if he  knew. But--Buddy, you must be careful, and always watching--never let  them catch you off your guard. I shall be in Laramie before you and  father and the boys, I suppose, if the Indians really do break out. And  you must promise me--\"    \"I'll promise, mother. And don't you go and trust old Colorou an inch.  He was jumping higher than any of 'em, and shaking his tomahawk and  yelling--he'd have scalped me right there if he'd seen me watching 'em.  Mother, I'm going to find father and tell him. And you may as well be  packing up, and--don't leave my guitar for them to smash, will you,  mother?\"    His mother laughed then and pushed him toward the door. She had an idea  of her own and she did not want to be hindered now in putting it into  action. Up the creek, in the bank behind a clump of willows, was a  small cave--or a large niche, one might call it--where many household  treasures might be safely hidden, if one went carefully, wading in the  creek to hide the tracks. She followed Buddy out, and called to Ezra  who was chopping wood with a grunt for every fall of the axe and many  rest--periods in the shade of the cottonwood tree.    At the stable, Buddy looked back and saw her talking earnestly to Ezra,  who stood nodding his head in complete approval. Buddy's knowledge of  women began and ended with his mother. Therefore, to him all women  were wonderful creatures whom men worshipped ardently because they were  created for the adoration of lesser souls. Buddy did not know what his  mother was going to do, but he was sure that whatever she did would be  right; so he hoisted his saddle on the handiest fresh horse, and loped  off to drive in the remuda, feeling certain that his father would move  swiftly to save his cattle that ranged back in the foothills, and that  the saddle horses would be wanted at a moment's notice.    Also, he reasoned, the range horses (mares and colts and the unbroken  geldings) would not be left to the mercy of the Indians. He did not  quite know how his father would manage it, but he decided that he would  corral the REMUDA first, and then drive in the other horses, that fed  scattered in undisturbed possession of a favorite grassy creek-bottom  farther up the Platte.    The saddle horses, accustomed to Buddy's driving, were easily corralled.  The other horses were fat and \"sassy\" and resented his coming among them  with the shrill whoop of authority. They gave him a hot hour's riding  before they finally bunched and went tearing down the river bottom  toward the ranch. Even so, Buddy left two of the wildest careening up  a narrow gulch. He had not attempted to ride after them; not because he  was afraid of Indians, for he was not. The war-dance held every young  buck and every old one in camp beyond the Pass. But the margin of safety  might be narrow, and Buddy was taking no chances that day.    When he was convinced that it was impossible for one boy to be in half a  dozen places at once, and that the cowboys would be needed to corral the  range bunch, Buddy whooped them all down the creek below the home ranch  and let them go just as his father came riding up to the corral.    \"They're war-dancing, father,\" Buddy shouted eagerly, slipping off his  horse and wiping away the trickles of perspiration with a handkerchief  not much redder than his face. \"I drove all the horses down, so they'd  be handy. Them range horses are pretty wild. There was two I couldn't  get. What'll I do now?\"    Bob Birnie looked at his youngest rider and smoothed his beard with one  hand. \"You're an ambitious lad, Buddy. It's the Utes you're meaning--or  is it the horses?\"    Buddy lifted his head and stared at his father disapprovingly.    \"Colorou is going to break out. I know. They've got their war paint all  on and they're dancing. I saw them myself. I was going after the gloves  Colorou s squaw was making for me,--but I didn't get 'em. I laid in the  brush and watched 'em dance.\" He stopped and looked again doubtfully at  his father. \"I thought you might want to get the cattle outa the way,\" he  added. \"I thought I could save some time--\"    \"You're sure about the paint?\"    \"Yes, I'm sure. And Colorou was just a-going it with his war bonnet on  and shaking his tomahawk and yelling--\"    \"Ye did well, lad. We'll be leaving for Big Creek to-night, so run away  now and rest yourself.\"    \"Oh, and can I go?\" Buddy's voice was shrill with eagerness.    \"I'll need you, lad, to look after the horses. It will give me one more  hand with the cattle. Now go tell Step-and-a-Half to make ready for a  week on the trail, and to have supper early so he can make his start  with the rest.\"    Buddy walked stiffly away to the cook's cabin where Step-and-a-Half sat  leisurely gouging the worst blemishes out of soft, old potatoes with a  chronic tendency to grow sprouts, before he peeled them for supper His  crippled leg was thrust out straight, his hat was perched precariously  over one ear because of the slanting sun rays through the window, and  a half-smoked cigarette waggled uncertainly in the corner of his mouth  while he sang dolefully a most optimistic ditty of the West:    \"O give me a home where the buff-alo roam, Where the deer and the  antelope play, Where never is heard a discouraging word And the sky is  not cloudy all day.\"    \"You're going to hear a discouraging word right now,\" Buddy broke in  ruthlessly upon the song. Whereupon, with a bit of importance in  his voice and in his manner, he proceeded to spoil Step-and-a-Half's  disposition and to deepen, if that were possible, his loathing of  Indians. Too often had he made dubious soup of his dishwater and the  leavings from a roundup crew's dinner, and watched blanketed bucks  smack lips over the mess, to run from them now without feeling utterly  disgusted with life. Step-and-a-Half's vituperations could be heard  above the clatter of pots and pans as he made ready for the journey.    That night's ride up the pass through the narrow range of high-peaked  hills to the Tomahawk's farthest range on Big Creek was a tedious  affair to Buddy. A man had been sent on a fast horse to warn the nearest  neighbor, who in turn would warn the next,--until no settler would  be left in ignorance of his danger. Ezra was already on the trail to  Laramie, with mother and Dulcie and the cats and a slat box full of  chickens, and a young sow with little pigs.    Buddy, whose word no one had questioned, who might pardonably have  considered himself a hero, was concerned chiefly with his mother's  flower garden which he had helped to plant and had watered more or  less faithfully with creek water carried in buckets. He was afraid the  Indians would step on the poppies and the phlox, and trample down the  four o'clocks which were just beginning to branch out and look nice and  bushy, and to blossom. The scent of the four o'clocks had been in his  nostrils when he came out at dusk with his fur overcoat which mother had  told him must not be left behind. Buddy himself merely liked flowers:  but mother talked to them and kissed them just for love, and pitied them  if Buddy forgot and let them go thirsty. He would have stayed to fight  for mother's flower garden, if it would have done any good.    He was thinking sleepily that next year he would plant flowers in boxes  that could be carried to the cave if the Indians broke out again, when  Tex Farley poked him in the ribs and told him to wake up or he'd fall  off his horse. It was a weary climb to the top of the range that divided  the valley of Big Creek from the North Platte, and a wearier climb down.  Twice Buddy caught himself on the verge of toppling out of the saddle.  For after all he was only a thirteen-year Old boy, growing like any  other healthy young animal. He had been riding hard that day and half of  the preceding night when he had raced back from the Reservation to  give warning of the impending outbreak. He needed sleep, and nature was  determined that he should have it.        CHAPTER FIVE: BUDDY RUNS TRUE TO TYPE    One never could predict with any certainty how long Indians would dance  before they actually took the trail of murder and pillage. So much  depended upon the Medicine, so much on signs and portents. It was even  possible that they might, for some mysterious reason unknown to their  white neighbors, decide at the last moment to bide their time. The  Tomahawk outfit worked from dawn until dark, and combed the foothills  of the Snowies hurriedly, riding into the most frequented, grassy basins  and wide canyons where the grass was lush and sweet and the mountain  streams rushed noisily over rocks. As fast as the cattle were gathered  they were pushed hastily toward the Platte, And though the men rode  warily with rifles as handy as their ropes, they rode in peace.    Buddy, proud of his job, counting himself as good a man as any of them,  became a small riding demon after rebellious saddle horses, herding them  away from thick undergrowth that might, for all he knew, hold Indians  waiting a chance to scalp him, driving the REMUDA close to the cabins  when night fell, because no man could be spared for night herding,  sleeping lightly as a cat beside a mouse hole. He did not say much,  perhaps because everyone was too busy to talk, himself included.    Men rode in at night dog-weary, pulled their saddles and hurried stiffly  to the cabin where Step-and-a-Half was showing his true worth as a cook  who could keep the coffee-pot boiling and yet be ready to pack up and  go at the first rifle-shot. They would bolt down enormous quantities of  bannock and boiled beef, swallow their coffee hot enough to scald a hog,  and stretch themselves out immediately to sleep.    "]]]
