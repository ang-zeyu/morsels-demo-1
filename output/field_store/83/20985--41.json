This  is the first appearance, in Charles's reign, of ship-money; a taxation  which had once been imposed by Elizabeth, but which afterwards, when  carried some steps further by Charles, created such violent discontents.    Of some, loans were required:[**] to others the way of benevolence was  proposed: methods supported by precedent, but always invidious, even in  times more submissive and compliant. In the most absolute governments,  such expedients would be regarded as irregular and unequal.    These counsels for supply were conducted with some moderation; till news  arrived, that a great battle was fought between the king of Denmark  and Count Tilly, the imperial general; in which the former was totally  defeated. Money now more than ever, became necessary, in order to repair  so great a breach in the alliance, and to support a prince who was so  nearly allied to Charles, and who had been engaged in the war chiefly by  the intrigues, solicitations, and promises of the English monarch. After  some deliberation, an act of council was passed, importing, that as the  urgency of affairs admitted not the way of parliament, the most speedy,  equal, and convenient method of supply was by a \"general loan\" from the  subject, according as every man was assessed in the rolls of the last  subsidy. That precise sum was required which each would have paid, had  the vote of four subsidies passed into a law: but care was taken  to inform the people, that the sums exacted were not to be called  subsidies, but loans.[***] Had any doubt remained, whether forced loans,  however authorized by precedent, and even by statute, were a violation  of liberty, and must, by necessary consequence, render all parliaments  superfluous, this was the proper expedient for opening the eyes of the  whole nation. The example of Henry VIII., who had once, in his arbitrary  reign, practiced a like method of levying a regular supply, was  generally deemed a very insufficient authority.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 415.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 416.         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 418. Whitlocke, p. 8.    The commissioners appointed to levy these loans, among other articles  of secret instruction, were enjoined, \"If any shall refuse to lend, and  shall make delays or excuses, and persist in his obstinacy, that they  examine him upon oath, whether he has been dealt with to deny or refuse  to lend, or make an [excuse] for not lending? Who has dealt with him,  and what speeches or persuasions were used to that purpose? And that  they also shall charge every such person, in his majesty's name, upon  his allegiance, not to disclose to any one what his answer was.\"[*] So  violent an inquisitorial power, so impracticable an attempt at secrecy,  were the objects of indignation, and even, in some degree, of ridicule.    That religious prejudices might support civil authority, sermons were  preached by Sibthorpe and Manwaring, in favor of the general loan; and  the court industriously spread them over the kingdom. Passive obedience  was there recommended in its full extent, the whole authority of  the state was represented as belonging to the king alone, and all  limitations of law and a constitution were rejected as seditious and  impious.[**] So openly was this doctrine espoused by the court, that  Archbishop Abbot, a popular and virtuous prelate, was, because he  refused to license Sibthorpe's sermon, suspended from the exercise of  his office, banished from London, and confined to one of his country  seats.[***] Abbot's principles of liberty, and his opposition to  Buckingham, had always rendered him very ungracious at court, and had  acquired him the character of a Puritan. For it is remarkable, that  this party made the privileges of the nation as much a part of their  religion, as the church party did the prerogatives of the crown: and  nothing tended further to recommend among the people, who always take  opinions in the lump, the whole system and all the principles of the  former sect. The king soon found by fatal experience, that this  engine of religion, which with so little necessity was introduced into  politics, falling under more fortunate management, was played with the  most terrible success against him.    While the king, instigated by anger and necessity, thus employed the  whole extent of his prerogative, the spirit of the people was far from  being subdued. Throughout England, many refused these loans; some were  even active in encouraging their neighbors to insist upon their common  rights and privileges. By warrant of the council, these were thrown into  prison.[****]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 419. Franklyn, p. 207.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 422. Franklyn, p. 208.         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 431.         **** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 429. Franklyn, p. 210.    Most of them with patience submitted to confinement, or applied by  petition to the king, who commonly released them. Five gentlemen  alone, Sir Thomas Darnel, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter Earl, Sir John  Heveningham, and Sir Edmond Hambden, had spirit enough, at their own  hazard and expense, to defend the public liberties, and to demand  releasement, not as a favor from the court, but as their due, by the  laws of their country.[*] No particular cause was assigned of their  commitment. The special command alone of the king and council was  pleaded. And it was asserted, that, by law, this was not sufficient  reason for refusing bail or releasement to the prisoners.    [Illustration: 1-623-hampden.jpg Sir Edmond Hambden]    This question was brought to a solemn trial, before the king's bench;  and the whole kingdom was attentive to the issue of a cause which was of  much greater consequence than the event of many battles.    By the debates on this subject, it appeared, beyond controversy, to the  nation, that their ancestors had been so jealous of personal liberty,  as to secure it against arbitrary power in the crown, by six[**] several  statutes, and by an article[***] of the Great Charter itself, the  most sacred foundation of the laws and constitution. But the kings of  England, who had not been able to prevent the enacting of these laws,  had sufficient authority, when the tide of liberty was spent, to  obstruct their regular execution; and they deemed it superfluous  to attempt the formal repeal of statutes which they found so many  expedients and pretences to elude.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 458. Franklyn, p. 224. Whitlocke, p.       8.         ** 25 Edw. III. cap. 4. 28 Edw. III. cap, 3. 37 Edw. III.       cap. 18 88 Edw. III. cap. 9 42 Edw. III. cap. 3. 1 Richard       II. cap. 12.         *** Chap. 29    Turbulent and seditious times frequently occurred, when the safety of  the people absolutely required the confinement of factious leaders;  and by the genius of the old constitution, the prince, of himself,  was accustomed to assume every branch of prerogative which was found  necessary for the preservation of public peace and of his own authority.  Expediency, at other times, would cover itself under the appearance of  necessity; and, in proportion as precedents multiplied, the will alone  of the sovereign was sufficient to supply the place of expediency, of  which he constituted himself the sole judge. In an age and nation where  the power of a turbulent nobility prevailed, and where the king had no  settled military force, the only means that could maintain public peace,  was the exertion of such prompt and discretionary powers in the crown;  and the public itself had become so sensible of the necessity, that  those ancient laws in favor of personal liberty, while often violated,  had never been challenged or revived during the course of near three  centuries. Though rebellious subjects had frequently, in the open field,  resisted the king's authority, no person had been found so bold, while  confined and at mercy, as to set himself in opposition to regal power,  and to claim the protection of the constitution against the will of  the sovereign. It was not till this age, when the spirit of liberty  was universally diffused, when the principles of government were nearly  reduced to a system, when the tempers of men, more civilized, seemed  less to require those violent exertions of prerogative, that these five  gentlemen above mentioned, by a noble effort, ventured, in this national  cause, to bring the question to a final determination. And the king was  astonished to observe, that a power exercised by his predecessors almost  without interruption, was found, upon trial, to be directly opposite to  the clearest laws, and supported by few undoubted precedents in courts  of judicature. These had scarcely in any instance refused bail upon  commitments by special command of the king, because the persons  committed had seldom or never dared to demand it, at least to insist on  their demand.    {1627.} Sir Randolf Crew, chief justice, had been displaced, as  unfit for the purposes of the court: Sir Nicholas Hyde, esteemed more  obsequious, had obtained that high office: yet the judges, by his  direction, went no further than to remand the gentlemen to prison, and  refuse the bail which was offered.[*] Heathe, the attorney-general,  insisted that the court, in imitation of the judges in the thirty-fourth  of Elizabeth,[**] should enter a general judgment, that no bail could  be granted upon a commitment by the king or council.[***] But the judges  wisely declined complying. The nation, they saw, was already to the last  degree exasperated. In the present disposition of men's minds, universal  complaints prevailed, as if the kingdom were reduced to slavery. And  the most invidious prerogative of the crown, it was said, that of  imprisoning the subject, is here "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#6)"],[1,"the restoration, they  thought themselves justly entitled. By the Presbyterians, said they, the  war was raised; by them was the populace first incited to tumults; by  their zeal, interest, and riches, were the armies supported; by their  force was the king subdued; and if, in the sequel, they protested  against those extreme violences committed on his person by the military  leaders, their opposition came too late, after having supplied these  usurpers with the power and the pretences by which they maintained their  sanguinary measures. They had indeed concurred with the royalists in  recalling the king; but ought they to be esteemed, on that account, more  affectionate to the royal cause? Rage and animosity, from disappointed  ambition, were plainly their sole motives; and if the king should now  be so imprudent as to distinguish them by any particular indulgences, he  would soon experience from them the same hatred and opposition which had  proved so fatal to his father.    The Catholics, though they had little interest in the nation, were a  considerable party at court; and from their services and sufferings  during the civil wars, it seemed but just to bear them some favor  and regard. These religionists dreaded an entire union among the  Protestants. Were they the sole nonconformists in the nation, the  severe execution of penal laws upon their sect seemed an infallible  consequence; and they used, therefore, all their interest to push  matters to extremity against the Presbyterians, who had formerly been  their most severe oppressors, and whom they now expected for their  companions in affliction. The earl of Bristol, who, from conviction, or  interest, or levity, or complaisance for the company with whom he lived,  had changed his religion during the king's exile, was regarded as the  head of this party.    The church party had, during so many years, suffered such injuries  and indignities from the sectaries of every denomination, that no  moderation, much less deference, was on this occasion to be expected in  the ecclesiastics. Even the laity of that communion seemed now disposed  to retaliate upon their enemies, according to the usual measures of  party justice. This sect or faction (for it partook of both) encouraged  the rumors of plots and conspiracies against the government; crimes  which, without any apparent reason, they imputed to their adversaries.  And instead of enlarging the terms of communion, in order to comprehend  the Presbyterians, they gladly laid hold of the prejudices which  prevailed among that sect, in order to eject them from their livings. By  the bill of uniformity, it was required, that every clergyman should be  reordained, if he had not before received Episcopal ordination; should  declare his assent to every thing contained in the Book of Common  Prayer; should take the oath of canonical obedience; should abjure the  solemn league, and covenant; and should renounce the principle of taking  arms on any pretence whatsoever against the king.    This bill reinstated the church in the same condition in which it stood  before the commencement of the civil wars; and as the old persecuting  laws of Elizabeth still subsisted in their full rigor, and new clauses  of a like nature were now enacted, all the king's promises of toleration  and of indulgence to tender consciences were thereby eluded and broken.  It is true, Charles, in his declaration from Breda, had expressed his  intention of regulating that indulgence by the advice and authority of  parliament; but this limitation could never reasonably be extended to  a total infringement and violation of his engagements. However, it  is agreed that the king did not voluntarily concur with this violent  measure; and that the zeal of Clarendon and of the church party among  the commons, seconded by the intrigues of the Catholics, was the chief  cause which extorted his consent.    The royalists, who now predominated, were very ready to signalize their  victory, by establishing those high principles of monarchy which their  antagonists had controverted: but when any real power or revenue was  demanded for the crown, they were neither so forward nor so liberal  in their concessions as the king would gladly have wished. Though the  parliament passed laws for regulating the navy, they took no notice  of the army, and declined giving their sanction to this dangerous  innovation. The king's debts were become intolerable; and the commons  were at last constrained to vote him an extraordinary supply of one  million two hundred thousand pounds, to be levied by eighteen monthly  assessments. But besides that this supply was much inferior to the  occasion, the king was obliged earnestly to solicit the commons, before  he could obtain it; and, in order to convince the house of its absolute  necessity, he desired them to examine strictly into all his receipts  and disbursements. Finding, likewise, upon inquiry, that the several  branches of revenue fell much short of the sums expected, they at  last, after much delay, voted a new imposition of two shillings on each  hearth; and this tax they settled on the king during life. The  whole established revenue, however, did not for many years exceed a  million;[*] a sum confessedly too narrow for the public expenses. A very  rigid frugality at least, which the king seems to have wanted, would  have been requisite to make it suffice for the dignity and security  of government. After all business was despatched, the parliament was  prorogued.         * D'Estrades, July 25, 1661. Mr. Ralph's History, vol. i. p.       176.    Before the parliament rose, the court was employed in making  preparations for the reception of the new queen, Catharine of Portugal,  to whom the king was betrothed, and who had just landed at Portsmouth.  During the time that the protector carried on the war with Spain, he was  naturally led to support the Portuguese in their revolt; and he engaged  himself by treaty to supply them with ten thousand men for their defence  against the Spaniards. On the king's restoration, advances were made  by Portugal for the renewal of the alliance; and in order to bind the  friendship closer, an offer was made of the Portuguese princess, and a  portion of five hundred thousand pounds, together with two fortresses,  Tangiers in Africa, and Bombay in the East Indies. Spain, who, after the  peace of the Pyrenees, bent all her force to recover Portugal, now in  appearance abandoned by France, took the alarm, and endeavored to fix  Charles in an opposite interest The Catholic king offered to adopt any  other princess as a daughter of Spain, either the princess of Parma, or,  what he thought more popular, some Protestant princess, the daughter of  Denmark, Saxony, or Orange; and on any of these he promised to confer  a dowry equal to that which was offered by Portugal. But many reasons  inclined Charles rather to accept of the Portuguese proposals. The great  disorders in the government and finances of Spain made the execution of  her promises be much doubted; and the king's urgent necessities demanded  some immediate supply of money. The interest of the English commerce  likewise seemed to require that the independency of Portugal should be  supported, lest the union of that crown with Spain should put the whole  treasures of America into the hands of one potentate. The claims, too,  of Spain upon Dunkirk and Jamaica, rendered it impossible, without  further concessions, to obtain the cordial friendship of that power; and  on the other hand, the offer, made by Portugal, of two such considerable  fortresses, promised a great accession to the naval force of England.  Above all, the proposal of a Protestant princess was no allurement to  Charles, whose inclinations led him strongly to give the preference to  a Catholic alliance. According to the most probable accounts,[*] the  resolution of marrying ihe daughter of Portugal was taken by the king,  unknown to all his ministers, and no remonstrances could prevail with  him to alter his intentions.         * Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 254. This account seems better       supported than that in Ablancourt's Memoirs, that the       chancellor chiefly pushed the Portuguese alliance. The       secret transactions of the court of England could not be       supposed to be much known to a French resident at Lisbon:       and whatever opposition the chancellor might make, he would       certainly endeavor to conceal it from the queen and all her       family; and even in the parliament and council would support       the resolution already taken. Clarendon himself says, in his       Memoirs, that he never either opposed or promoted the       Portuguese match.    When the matter was laid before the council, all voices concurred  in approving the resolution; and the parliament expressed the same  complaisance. And thus was concluded, seemingly with universal consent,  the inauspicious marriage with Catharine, a princess of virtue, but who  was never able, either by the graces of her person or humor, to make  herself agreeable to the king. The report, however, of her natural  incapacity to have children, seems to have been groundless, since she  was twice declared to be pregnant.[*]         * Lord Lansdowne's Defence of General Monk. Temple vol. ii       p. 154    The festivity of these espousals was clouded by the trial and execution  of criminals. Berkstead, Cobbet, and Okey, three regicides, had escaped  beyond sea; and after wandering some time concealed in Germany, came  privately to Delft, having appointed their families to meet them in that  place. They were discovered by Downing, the king's resident in Holland,  who had formerly served the protector and commonwealth in the same  station, and who once had even been chaplain to Okey's regiment. He  applied for a warrant to arrest them. It had been usual for the states  to grant these warrants;"]]]
