Come, we will set it free!\" And with these words they untied the  string round the cub's neck, and turned its head toward the spot where  the old foxes sat; and as the wounded foot was no longer painful, with  one bound it dashed to its parents' side and licked them all over for  joy, while they seemed to bow their thanks, looking toward the two  friends. So, with peace in their hearts, the latter went off to another  place, and, choosing a pretty spot, produced the wine bottle and ate  their noonday meal; and after a pleasant day, they returned to their  homes, and became firmer friends than ever.    Now the man who had rescued the fox's cub was a tradesman in good  circumstances: he had three or four agents and two maid-servants,  besides men-servants; and altogether he lived in a liberal manner. He  was married, and this union had brought him one son, who had reached his  tenth year, but had been attacked by a strange disease which defied all  the physicians' skill and drugs. At last a famous physician prescribed  the liver taken from a live fox, which, as he said, would certainly  effect a cure. If that were not forthcoming, the most expensive medicine  in the world would not restore the boy to health. When the parents heard  this, they were at their wits' end. However, they told the state of the  case to a man who lived on the mountains. \"Even though our child should  die for it,\" they said, \"we will not ourselves deprive other creatures  of their lives; but you, who live among the hills, are sure to hear when  your neighbours go out fox-hunting. We don't care what price we might  have to pay for a fox's liver; pray, buy one for us at any expense.\" So  they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf; and he, having  promised faithfully to execute the commission, went his way.    In the night of the following day there came a messenger, who announced  himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the  fox's liver; so the master of the house went out to see him.    \"I have come from Mr. So-and-so. Last night the fox's liver that you  required fell into his hands; so he sent me to bring it to you.\" With  these words the messenger produced a small jar, adding, \"In a few days  he will let you know the price.\"    When he had delivered his message, the master of the house was greatly  pleased and said, \"Indeed, I am deeply grateful for this kindness, which  will save my son's life.\"    Then the good wife came out, and received the jar with every mark of  politeness.    \"We must make a present to the messenger.\"    \"Indeed, sir, I've already been paid for my trouble.\"    \"Well, at any rate, you must stop the night here.\"    \"Thank you, sir: I've a relation in the next village whom I have not  seen for a long while, and I will pass the night with him;\" and so he  took his leave, and went away.    The parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they  had procured the fox's liver. The next day the doctor came and  compounded a medicine for the patient, which at once produced a good  effect, and there was no little joy in the household. As luck would have  it, three days after this the man whom they had commissioned to buy the  fox's liver came to the house: so the goodwife hurried out to meet him  and welcome him.    \"How quickly you fulfilled our wishes, and how kind of you to send at  once! The doctor prepared the medicine, and now our boy can get up and  walk about the room; and it's all owing to your goodness.\"    \"Wait a bit!\" cried the guest, who did not know what to make of the joy  of the two parents. \"The commission with which you entrusted me about  the fox's liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility, so I came  to-day to make my excuses; and now I really can't understand what you  are so grateful to me for.\"    \"We are thanking you, sir,\" replied the master of the house, bowing with  his hands on the ground, \"for the fox's liver which we asked you to  procure for us.\"    \"I really am perfectly unaware of having sent you a fox's liver: there  must be some mistake here. Pray inquire carefully into the matter.\"    \"Well, this is very strange. Four nights ago, a man of some five or six  and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you, to the  effect that you had sent him with a fox's liver, which you had just  procured, and said that he would come and tell us the price another day.  When we asked him to spend the night here, he answered that he would  lodge with a relation in the next village, and went away.\"    The visitor was more and more lost in amazement, and, leaning his head  on one side in deep thought, confessed that he could make nothing of it.  As for the husband and wife, they felt quite out of countenance at  having thanked a man so warmly for favours of which he denied all  knowledge; and so the visitor took his leave and went home.    That night there appeared at the pillow of the master of the house a  woman of about one or two and thirty years of age, who said: \"I am the  fox that lives at such-and-such a mountain. Last spring, when I was  taking out my cub to play, it was carried off by some boys, and only  saved by your goodness. The desire to requite this kindness pierced me  to the quick. At last, when calamity attacked your house, I thought I  might be of use to you. Your son's illness could not be cured without a  liver taken from a live fox, so to repay your kindness I killed my cub  and took out its liver; then its sire, disguising himself as a  messenger, brought it to your house.\"    And as she spoke, the fox shed tears; and the master of the house,  wishing to thank her, moved in bed, upon which his wife awoke and asked  him what was the matter; but he too, to her great astonishment, was  biting the pillow and weeping bitterly.    \"Why are you weeping thus?\" asked she.    At last he sat up in bed and said: \"Last spring, when I was out on a  pleasure excursion, I was the means of saving the life of a fox's cub,  as I told you at the time. The other day I told Mr. So-and-so that,  although my son were to die before my eyes, I would not be the means of  killing a fox on purpose, but asked him, in case he heard of any hunter  killing a fox, to buy it for me. How the foxes came to hear of this I  don't know; but the foxes to whom I had shown kindness killed their own  cub and took out the liver; and the old dog-fox, disguising himself as a  messenger from the person to whom we had confided the commission, came  here with it. His mate has just been at my pillow-side and told me all  about it. Hence it was that, in spite of myself, I was moved to tears.\"    When she heard this, the goodwife likewise was blinded by her tears, and  for a while they lay lost in thought; but at last, coming to themselves,  they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idol stood, and  spent the night in reciting prayers and praises, and the next day they  published the matter to the household and to their relations and  friends. Now, although there are instances of men killing their own  children to requite a favour, there is no other example of foxes having  done such a thing; so the story became the talk of the whole country.    Now, the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine  selected the prettiest spot on the premises to erect a shrine to Inari  Sama,[2] the Fox God, and offered sacrifice to the two old foxes, for  whom he purchased the highest rank at the court of the Mikado.           *       *       *       *       *    The passage in the tale which speaks of rank being purchased for the  foxes at the court of the Mikado is, of course, a piece of nonsense.  \"The saints who are worshipped in Japan,\" writes a native authority,  \"are men who, in the remote ages, when the country was developing  itself, were sages, and by their great and virtuous deeds having earned  the gratitude of future generations, received divine honours after their  death. How can the Son of Heaven, who is the father and mother of his  people, turn dealer in ranks and honours? If rank were a matter of  barter, it would cease to be a reward to the virtuous.\"    All matters connected with the shrines of the Shinto, or indigenous  religion, are confided to the superintendence of the families of Yoshida  and Fushimi, Kuges or nobles of the Mikado's court at Kiyoto. The  affairs of the Buddhist or imported religion are under the care of the  family of Kanjuji. As it is necessary that those who as priests perform  the honourable office of serving the gods should be persons of some  standing, a certain small rank is procured for them through the  intervention of the representatives of the above noble families, who, on  the issuing of the required patent, receive as their perquisite a fee,  which, although insignificant in itself, is yet of importance to the  poor Kuges, whose penniless condition forms a great contrast to the  wealth of their inferiors in rank, the Daimios. I believe that this is  the only case in which rank can be bought or sold in Japan. In China, on  the contrary, in spite of what has been written by Meadows and other  admirers of the examination system, a man can be what he pleases by  paying for it; and the coveted button, which is nominally the reward of  learning and ability, is more often the prize of wealthy ignorance.    The saints who are alluded to above are the saints of the whole country,  as distinct from those who for special deeds are locally worshipped.

And off he ran.    Granny gave him a loaf just from the oven--a nice, brown, crusty loaf.  This time Epaminondas was certainly going to do what mammy had told him.    He proudly got out his string and tied it to the loaf. Then he put the  loaf on the ground, and taking the other end of the string in his hand,  he went along home.    When he reached home, his mammy gave one look at the thing tied to the  end of the string.    \"What have you brought, Epaminondas?\" she cried.    \"Bread, mammy. Granny sent it to you.\"    \"Oh, Epaminondas! Epaminondas! How could you be so foolish?\" cried his  mammy. \"Now I have no bread for dinner. I'll have to go and get some  myself.\"    She went into the house and got her bonnet. When she came out, she said,  \"Epaminondas, do you see those three mince pies I've put on the doorstep  to cool. Well, now, you hear me, Epaminondas. You be careful how you  step on those pies!\"    \"Yes, mammy.\"    His mammy went off down the road; Epaminondas went to the door and  looked out. \"Mammy told me to be careful how I step on those mince  pies,\" he said, \"so I must be careful how I do it. I'll step right in  the middle of every one.\"    And he did!    When his mammy came home, there were no pies for dinner.    Now she was angry all over, and something happened. I don't know, and  you don't know, but we can guess.    Poor Epaminondas!--SOUTHERN TALE.    [Illustration: Epaminondas stepping in the pies]          HOW BROTHER RABBIT FOOLED THE WHALE AND THE ELEPHANT    I      One day Brother Rabbit was running along on the sand, lippety, lippety,  lippety. He was going to a fine cabbage field. On the way he saw the  whale and the elephant talking together.    Brother Rabbit said, \"I'd like to know what they are talking about.\" So  he crouched down behind some bushes and listened.    This is what Brother Rabbit heard the whale say:    \"You are the biggest thing on the land, Brother Elephant, and I am the  biggest thing in the sea. If we work together, we can rule all the  animals in the world. We can have our own way about everything.\"    \"Very good, very good,\" trumpeted the elephant. \"That suits me. You keep  the sea, and I will keep the land.\"    [Illustration: Brother Rabbit listening]    \"That's a bargain,\" said the whale, as he swam away.    Brother Rabbit laughed to himself. \"They won't rule me,\" he said, as he  ran off.    Brother Rabbit soon came back with a very long and a very strong rope  and his big drum. He hid the drum in some bushes. Then taking one end of  the rope, he walked up to the elephant.    \"Oh, dear Mr. Elephant,\" he said, \"you are big and strong; will you have  the kindness to do me a favor?\"    The elephant was pleased, and he trumpeted, \"Certainly, certainly. What  is it?\"    \"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore, and I can't pull her out,\"  said Brother Rabbit. \"If you will help me, you will do me a great  service. You are so strong, I am sure you can get her out.\"    \"Certainly, certainly,\" trumpeted the elephant.    \"Thank you,\" said the rabbit. \"Take this rope in your trunk, and I will  tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my drum to let you know  when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for the cow is very  heavy.\"    \"Huh!\" trumpeted the elephant, \"I'll pull her out, or break the rope.\"    Brother Rabbit tied the rope to the elephant's trunk and ran off,  lippety, lippety.      II      He ran till he came to the shore where the whale was. Making a bow,  Brother Rabbit said, \"0, mighty and wonderful Whale, will you do me a  favor?\"    \"What is it?\" asked the whale.    \"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore,\" said Brother Rabbit, \"and I  cannot pull her out. Of course you can do it. If you will be so kind as  to help me, I shall be very much obliged.\"    \"Certainly,\" said the whale, \"certainly.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Brother Rabbit, \"take hold of this rope, and I will  tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my big drum to let you  know when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for my cow is very  heavy.\"    \"Never fear,\" said the whale, \"I could pull a dozen cows out of the  mud.\"    \"I am sure you could,\" said the rabbit politely. \"Only be sure to begin  gently. Then pull harder and harder till you get her out.\"    The rabbit ran away into the bushes where he had hidden the drum and  began to beat it. Then the whale began to pull and the elephant began to  pull. In a minute the rope tightened till it was stretched as hard as a  bar of iron.    \"This is a very heavy cow,\" said the elephant, \"but I'll pull her out.\"  Bracing his fore feet in the earth, he gave a tremendous pull.    But the whale had no way to brace himself.    \"Dear me,\" he said. \"That cow must surely be stuck tight.\" Lashing his  tail in the water, he gave a marvelous pull.    He pulled harder; the elephant pulled harder. Soon the whale found  himself sliding toward the land. He was so provoked with the cow that he  went head first, down to the bottom of the sea.    That was a pull! The elephant was jerked off his feet, and came slipping  and sliding toward the sea. He was very angry.    \"That cow must be very strong to drag me in this way,\" he said. \"I will  brace myself.\"    Kneeling down on the ground, he twisted the rope around his trunk. Then  he began to pull his very best, and soon the whale came up out of the  water.    Then each saw that the other had hold of the rope.    \"How is this?\" cried the whale. \"I thought I was pulling Brother  Rabbit's cow.\"    \"That is what I thought,\" said the elephant. \"Brother Rabbit is making  fun of us. He must pay for this. I forbid him to eat a blade of grass on  land, because he played a trick on us.\"    \"And I will not allow him to drink a drop of water in the sea,\" said the  whale.    But Little Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed, and laughed, and  laughed.    \"Much do I care,\" he said. \"I can get all the green things I want, and I  don't like salt water.\"    --SOUTHERN FOLK TALE.          [Illustration: A mother with children in winter]    A CHRISTMAS WISH        I'd like a stocking made for a giant,      And a meeting house full of toys;    Then I'd go out on a happy hunt      For the poor little girls and boys;    Up the street and down the street,      And across and over the town,    I'd search and find them every one,      Before the sun went down.      One would want a new jack-knife      Sharp enough to cut;    One would long for a doll with hair,      And eyes that open and shut;    One would ask for a china set      With dishes all to her mind;    One would wish a Noah's ark      With beasts of every kind.      Some would like a doll cook-stove      And a little toy wash tub;    Some would prefer a little drum,      For a noisy rub-a-dub;    Some would wish for a story book,      And some for a set of blocks;    Some would be wild with happiness      Over a new tool-box.      And some would rather have little shoes,      And other things warm to wear,    For many children are very poor,      And the winter is hard to bear;    I'd buy soft flannels for little frocks,      And a thousand stockings or so,    And the jolliest little coats and cloaks,      To keep out the frost and snow.    [Illustration: Christmas toys]      I'd load a wagon with caramels      And candy of every kind,    And buy all the almond and pecan nuts      And taffy that I could find;    And barrels and barrels of oranges      I'd scatter right in the way,    So the children would find them the very first thing,      When they wake on Christmas day.    --EUGENE FIELD.          [Illustration: The church tower]    THE CHRISTMAS BELLS    I      Long, long ago, in a far away city, there was a large church. The tower  of this church was so high that it seamed to touch the clouds, and in  the high tower there were three wonderful bells. When they rang, they  made sweet music.    There was something strange about these bells. They were never heard to  ring except on Christmas eve, and no one knew who rang them. Some people  thought it was the wind blowing through the tower. Others thought the  angels rang them when a gift pleased the Christ Child.    Although the people did not know what rang the bells, they loved to hear  them. They would come from miles around to listen to the wonderful  music. When they had heard the bells, they would go out of the church,  silent but happy. Then all would go back to their homes feeling that  Christmas had come, indeed.    One Christmas eve the people in the church waited and waited, but the  bells did not ring. Silently and sadly they went home. Christmas after  Christmas came and went. Nearly one hundred years passed by, and in all  that time the bells did not ring.    People sometimes asked one another, \"Do you suppose the bells ever did  ring?\"    \"Yes,\" said one very old man. \"I have often heard my father tell how  beautifully they rang on Christmas eve. There was more love in the world  then.\"    Every Christmas eve the church was filled with people who waited and  listened. They hoped that the bells would ring again as they had rung  long ago. Though many gifts were laid on the altar, still the bells did  not ring.      II      Christmas was near at hand again, and every one was happy.    Not far from the city two little brothers lived on a farm--Pedro and  Little Brother.    Their father was poor and had no gift to lay on the altar. But Pedro had  saved all his earnings, and he had one shining silver piece. His father  had promised the little boys that they might go to the church on  Christmas eve and take the gift.    It was quite dark when the lads started on their way to the city. The  snow was falling fast, but they buttoned their little jackets close  about them and walked along briskly. They were not far from the church  when they heard a low whine of distress."]]]
