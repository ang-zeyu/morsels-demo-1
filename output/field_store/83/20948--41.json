Washington presented the rare  combination of a great soldier and a great statesman as well. He aimed  not only to win battles, but by his operations in the field to influence  the political situation and affect public opinion. The American  Revolution was going to pieces. Unless some decisive victory could be  won immediately, it would have come to an end in the winter of 1776-77.  This Washington knew, and it was this which nerved his arm. The results  justified his forethought. The victories of Trenton and Princeton  restored the failing spirits of the people, and, what was hardly  less important, produced a deep impression in Europe in favor of the  colonies. The country, which had lost heart, and become supine and  almost hostile, revived. The militia again took the field. Outlying  parties of the British were attacked and cut off, and recruits once more  began to come in to the Continental army. The Revolution was saved. That  the English colonies in North America would have broken away from the  mother country sooner or later cannot be doubted, but that particular  Revolution Of 1776 would have failed within a year, had it not been  for Washington. It is not, however, merely the fact that he was a great  soldier and statesman which we should remember. The most memorable thing  to us, and to all men, is the heroic spirit of the man, which rose in  those dreary December days to its greatest height, under conditions  so adverse that they had crushed the hope of every one else. Let it  be remembered, also, that it was not a spirit of desperation or of  ignorance, a reckless daring which did not count the cost. No one knew  better than Washington--no one, indeed, so well--the exact state of  affairs; for he, conspicuously among great men, always looked facts  fearlessly in the face, and never deceived himself. He was under no  illusions, and it was this high quality of mind as much as any other  which enabled him to win victories.    How he really felt we know from what he wrote to Congress on December  20, when he said: \"It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of  the line of my duty to adopt these measures or to advise thus freely.  A character to lose, an estate to forfeit, the inestimable blessing of  liberty at stake, and a life devoted, must be my excuse.\" These were the  thoughts in his mind when he was planning this masterly campaign. These  same thoughts, we may readily believe, were with him when his boat was  making its way through the ice of the Delaware on Christmas Eve. It was  a very solemn moment, and he was the only man in the darkness of that  night who fully understood what was at stake; but then, as always, he  was calm and serious, with a high courage which nothing could depress.    The familiar picture of a later day depicts Washington crossing the  Delaware at the head of his soldiers. He is standing up in the boat,  looking forward in the teeth of the storm. It matters little whether the  work of the painter is in exact accordance with the real scene or not.  The daring courage, the high resolve, the stern look forward and onward,  which the artist strove to show in the great leader, are all vitally  true. For we may be sure that the man who led that well-planned but  desperate assault, surrounded by darker conditions than the storms of  nature which gathered about his boat, and carrying with him the fortunes  of his country, was at that moment one of the most heroic figures in  history.          BENNINGTON         We are but warriors for the working-day;       Our gayness and our guilt are all besmirch'd       With rainy marching in the painful field;       There's not a piece of feather in our host       (Good argument, I hope, we shall not fly),       And time hath worn us into slovenry.       But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim,       And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night       They'll be in fresher robes.                            --Henry V.      The battle of Saratoga is included by Sir Edward Creasy among his  fifteen decisive battles which have, by their result, affected the  history of the world. It is true that the American Revolution was saved  by Washington in the remarkable Princeton and Trenton campaign, but  it is equally true that the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, in the  following autumn, turned the scale decisively in favor of the colonists  by the impression which it made in Europe. It was the destruction of  Burgoyne's army which determined France to aid the Americans against  England. Hence came the French alliance, the French troops, and, what  was of far more importance, a French fleet by which Washington was  finally able to get control of the sea, and in this way cut off  Cornwallis at Yorktown and bring the Revolution to a successful close.  That which led, however, more directly than anything else to the final  surrender at Saratoga was the fight at Bennington, by which Burgoyne's  army was severely crippled and weakened, and by which also, the hardy  militia of the North eastern States were led to turn out in large  numbers and join the army of Gates.    The English ministry had built great hopes upon Burgoyne's expedition,  and neither expense nor effort had been spared to make it successful. He  was amply furnished with money and supplies as well as with English and  German troops, the latter of whom were bought from their wretched little  princes by the payment of generous subsidies. With an admirably equipped  army of over seven thousand men, and accompanied by a large force of  Indian allies, Burgoyne had started in May, 1777, from Canada. His plan  was to make his way by the lakes to the head waters of the Hudson, and  thence southward along the river to New York, where he was to unite with  Sir William Howe and the main army; in this way cutting the colonies in  two, and separating New England from the rest of the country.    At first all went well. The Americans were pushed back from their posts  on the lakes, and by the end of July Burgoyne was at the head waters of  the Hudson. He had already sent out a force, under St. Leger, to take  possession of the valley of the Mohawk--an expedition which finally  resulted in the defeat of the British by Herkimer, and the capture  of Fort Stanwix. To aid St. Leger by a diversion, and also to capture  certain magazines which were reported to be at Bennington, Burgoyne sent  another expedition to the eastward. This force consisted of about five  hundred and fifty white troops, chiefly Hessians, and one hundred and  fifty Indians, all under the command of Colonel Baum. They were within  four miles of Bennington on August 13, 1777, and encamped on a hill just  within the boundaries of the State of New York. The news of the advance  of Burgoyne had already roused the people of New York and New Hampshire,  and the legislature of the latter State had ordered General Stark with  a brigade of militia to stop the progress of the enemy on the western  frontier. Stark raised his standard at Charlestown on the Connecticut  River, and the militia poured into his camp. Disregarding Schuyler's  orders to join the main American army, which was falling back before  Burgoyne, Stark, as soon as he heard of the expedition against  Bennington, marched at once to meet Baum. He was within a mile of the  British camp on August 14, and vainly endeavored to draw Baum into  action. On the 15th it rained heavily, and the British forces occupied  the time in intrenching themselves strongly upon the hill which they  held. Baum meantime had already sent to Burgoyne for reinforcements,  and Burgoyne had detached Colonel Breymann with over six hundred regular  troops to go to Baum's assistance. On the 16th the weather cleared, and  Stark, who had been reinforced by militia from western Massachusetts,  determined to attack.    Early in the day he sent men, under Nichols and Herrick, to get into the  rear of Baum's position. The German officer, ignorant of the country  and of the nature of the warfare in which he was engaged, noticed small  bodies of men in their shirtsleeves, and carrying guns without bayonets,  making their way to the rear of his intrenchments. With singular  stupidity he concluded that they were Tory inhabitants of the country  who were coming to his assistance, and made no attempt to stop them. In  this way Stark was enabled to mass about five hundred men in the rear  of the enemy's position. Distracting the attention of the British by a  feint, Stark also moved about two hundred men to the right, and having  thus brought his forces into position he ordered a general assault,  and the Americans proceeded to storm the British intrenchments on every  side. The fight was a very hot one, and lasted some two hours. The  Indians, at the beginning of the action, slipped away between the  American detachments, but the British and German regulars stubbornly  stood their ground. It is difficult to get at the exact numbers of the  American troops, but Stark seems to have had between fifteen hundred and  two thousand militia. He thus outnumbered his enemy nearly three to  one, but his men were merely country militia, farmers of the New England  States, very imperfectly disciplined, and armed only with muskets and  fowling-pieces, without bayonets or side-arms. On the other side Baum  had the most highly disciplined troops of England and Germany under  his command, well armed and equipped, and he was moreover strongly  intrenched with artillery well placed behind the breastworks. The  advantage in the fight should have been clearly with Baum and his  regulars, who merely had to hold an intrenched hill.    It was not a battle in which either military strategy or a scientific  management of troops was displayed. All that Stark did was to place his  men so that they could attack the enemy's position on every side, and  then the Americans went "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#6)"],[1,"its ordinary level, and so bringing about that annual  overflow which in Egypt takes the place of rain.    It is certain that the ancient Egyptians knew nothing as to the source  of their great water-supply,[4] their knowledge being limited to the  combined river which begins at Khartum, and for 1,750 miles flows  uninterruptedly, and, with the exception of the River Atbara, without  further tributaries until it reaches the sea; and it is curious to  think that for every one of these 1,750 miles the Nile is a _slowly  diminishing_ stream, water-wheels, steam-pumps, and huge arterial  canals distributing its water in all directions over the land. The  large number of dams and regulators constructed within recent years  still further aid this distribution of the Nile water, and it is a  remarkable and almost incredible fact that with the closing of the  latest barrage at Damietta, the Nile will be so completely controlled  that of all the flow of water which pours so magnificently through the  cataracts not a drop will reach the sea!    [Footnote 4: Many of the ancients believed the First Cataract to be  its source.]    One can easily understand the reverence with which the ancients  regarded their mysterious river, which, rising no one knew where, year  by year continued its majestic flow, and by its regular inundations  brought wealth to the country, and it is no wonder that the rising of  its waters should have been the signal for a series of religious and  festal ceremonies, and led the earlier inhabitants of Egypt to worship  the river as a god. Some of these festivals still continue, and it is  only a very few years since the annual sacrifice of a young girl to  the Nile in flood was prohibited by the Khedive.    Though regular in its period of inundation, which begins in June, its  height varies from year to year; 40 to 45 feet constitutes a good  Nile--anything less than this implies a shortage of water and more or  less scanty crops; while should the Nile rise _higher_ than 45 feet  the result is often disastrous, embankments being swept away, gardens  devastated, while numbers of houses and little hamlets built on the  river-banks are undermined and destroyed.    The whole river as known to the ancients was navigable, and formed the  great trade route by which gold from Sheba, ivory, gum, ebony, and  many other commodities were brought into the country. The armies of  Pharaoh were carried by it on many warlike expeditions, and by its  means the Roman legions penetrated to the limits of the then known  world.    Hippopotamus and crocodile were numerous, and afforded sport for the  nobles, and though steamboats and increased traffic have driven these  away, on many a temple wall are pictured incidents of the chase, as  well as records of their wars.    It is natural, therefore, that on the banks of their mighty waterway  the Egyptians should have erected their greatest monuments, and the  progress of the Roman armies may still be traced by the ruins of their  fortified towns and castles, which, from many a rocky islet or crag,  command the river.    In another chapter I will tell you more about the monuments; at  present I wish to describe the Nile as it appears to-day.    Our first view of the river is obtained as we cross the Kasr-en-Nil  bridge at Cairo to join one of the many steamers by which visitors  make the Nile trip, and one's first impression is one of great beauty,  especially in the early morning. On the East Bank the old houses of  Bulak rise from the water's edge, and continue in a series of old  houses and palaces to the southern end of Rhoda Island, whose tall  palms and cypress-trees rise above the silvery mist which still hangs  upon the water. On the west the high mud-banks are crowned with palms  and lebbek-trees as far as one can see. Below the bridge, their white  sails gleaming in the early sun, hundreds of Nile boats are waiting in  readiness for the time appointed for its opening. On both banks steady  streams of people pass to and fro to fill their water-skins or jars,  while children paddle in the stream or make mud-pies upon the bank as  they will do all the world over.    The water is very muddy and very smooth, and reflects every object to  perfection; for these early mornings are almost invariably still, and  the water is unruffled by the north wind, which, with curious  regularity, springs up before midday.    I have already spoken of the high lateen sail of the Nile boats, a  form of sail which, though beautiful, has not been devised for  _pictorial_ purposes. In every country and in every sea peculiarities  of build and rig are displayed in native vessels. This is not the  result of whim or chance, but has been evolved as the result of long  experience of local requirements and conditions, and in every case I  think it may be taken that the native boat is the one most suited to  the conditions under which it is employed. So on the Nile these lofty  sails are designed to overtop the high banks and buildings, and so  catch the breeze which would otherwise be intercepted. The build of  the boats also is peculiar; they are very wide and flat bottomed, and  the rudders are unusually large, so as to enable them to turn quickly  in the narrow channels, which are often tortuous. The bow rises in a  splendid curve high out of the water, and throws the spray clear of  its low body, for the Egyptian loads his boat very heavily, and I have  often seen them so deep in the water that a little wall of mud has  been added to the gunwale so as to keep out the waves.    These native boats are of several kinds, from the small \"felucca,\" or  open boat used for ferry or pleasure purposes, to the large \"giassa,\"  or cargo boat of the river. Some of these are very large, carrying two  or three enormous sails, while their cargoes of coal or goods of  various kinds are often as much as 150 tons; yet they sail fast, and  with a good breeze there are few steamers on the river which could  beat them.    The navigation of the Nile is often difficult, especially when the  river is falling, for each year it alters its course and new  sand-banks are formed, and it is not always easy to decide which is  the right channel to steer for. The watermen, however, are very  expert, and can usually determine their course by the nature of the  ripple on the water, which varies according to its depth. Frequently,  however, from accidents of light or other causes, it is not possible  to gauge the river in this way, so every boat is provided with long  sounding-poles called \"midra,\" by means of which men stationed at  either side of the bow feel their way through the difficult channels,  calling out the depths of water as they go. In spite of these  precautions, however, steamers and sailing boats alike often stick  fast upon some bank which has, perhaps, been formed in a few hours by  a sudden shift of the wind or slight diversion of the current, caused  by the tumbling in of a portion of the bank a little higher up-stream.  Many of these boats travel long distances, bringing cargoes of coal,  cement, machinery, cotton goods, and hardware from the coast for  distribution in the provinces of Upper Egypt, and on their return  voyage are laden with sugar-cane or corn, and many other articles of  produce and native manufacture. As night falls, they usually moor  alongside the bank, when fires are lit, and the crews prepare their  simple evening meal. The supply of food, it may be noticed, is usually  kept in a bag, which is slung from the rigging, or a short post where  all can see it and no one be able to take advantage of another by  feeding surreptitiously.    It is often a pretty sight when several of these boats are moored  together, when, their day's work over, their crews will gather round  the fires, and to the accompaniment of tambourine or drum sing songs  or recite stories until it is time to sleep. No sleeping accommodation  is provided, and all the hardy boatman does is to wrap his cloak about  his head and lie among whatever portion of the cargo is least hard  and offers most protection from the wind.    The Nile banks themselves are interesting. In colour and texture  rather like chocolate, they are cut into terraces by the different  levels of the water, while the lapping of the waves is perpetually  undermining them, so that huge slabs of the rich alluvial mud are  continually falling away into the river. Each of these terraces, as it  emerges from the receding water, is planted with beans or melons by  the thrifty farmer, while the sand-banks forming in the river will  presently also be under cultivation, the natives claiming them while  still covered with water, their claims being staked by Indian-corn  stalks or palm-branches.    Like the canal banks in the Delta, the Nile banks form the great  highway for Upper Egypt, and at all times of the day one may see the  people and their animals silhouetted against the sky as they pass to  and fro between their villages. In the neighbourhood of large towns,  or such villages as hold a weekly market, the banks are very animated,  and for many miles are thronged with people from the surrounding  district, some walking, others riding on camels, donkeys, or  buffaloes, pressing towards the market to enjoy the show, or sell the  many articles of produce with which they are laden.    At the water's edge herds of buffaloes wallow in the river, tended by  a little boy who stares stolidly at your steamer as it passes or, in  great excitement, chases your vessel and vainly cries for  \"backshish.\"[5] At frequent intervals are the water-wheels and  \"shadufs,\" which raise the water to the level of the fields, and  these are such important adjuncts of the farm that I must describe  them. The \"shaduf\" is one of the oldest and one of the simplest  methods of raising water in existence. A long pole is balanced on a  short beam supported by two columns of mud, about 4 "]]]
