[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],[0,"Andrew Marvell (#6)"],[1," the first day of the so-called trial (though it was no  greater a travesty of justice than many a real trial both before and  after) is one of the best-known stories in English history. There are  several versions of it. Having provided herself with a seat in a small  gallery in Westminster Hall, just above the heads of the judges, when  her husband's name was called out as one of the commissioners, the  intrepid lady (no Cavalier's dame, be it remembered, but a true blue  Presbyterian), a brave soldier's daughter, cried out, \"Lord Fairfax is  not here; he will never sit among you. You do wrong to name him as a  sitting Commissioner.\" This is Rushworth's version, and he was present.  Clarendon, who was not present, being abroad at the time, reports the  words as, \"He has more wit than to be here.\"    Later on in the day, when the President Bradshaw interrupted the king  and peremptorily bade him to answer the charges exhibited against him  \"in the name of the Commons of England assembled, and of the people of  England,\" Lady Fairfax again rose to her feet and exclaimed, \"It's a  lie! Not half the people. Where are they and their consents? Oliver  Cromwell is a traitor.\"    Lieutenant-Colonel Axtell, who during the trial was in command of a  regiment in Westminster and charged by his military superior, Lord  Fairfax himself, with the duty of maintaining order, hearing this  disturbance, went forward and told Lady Fairfax to hold her tongue,  sound advice which she appears to have taken. After the Restoration  Axtell was put to his trial as a \"regicide.\" His defence, which was,  that as a soldier he obeyed his orders, and was no more guilty than his  general, Lord Fairfax, was not listened to, and he was sentenced to  death, a fate which he met like the brave man he was.    Although Fairfax did not immediately resign his command after the king's  death, from that moment he lost heart in the cause. Lady Fairfax, whose  loyalty to Charles may have been quickened by her dislike of Oliver, had  great influence with him, and it may well be that his conscience pricked  him. The rupture came in June 1650, when Charles's son made his  appearance in Scotland and his peace with the Presbyterians, subscribing  with inward emotions it would be unkind to attempt to describe the  Solemn League and Covenant, and attending services and listening to  sermons the length of which, at least, he never forgot. War was plainly  imminent between the two countries. The question was, who should begin?  Cromwell, who had hurried home from Ireland, Lambert, and Harrison were  all keen to strike the first blow. Fairfax felt a scruple, and in those  days scruples counted. Was there, he asked, a just cause for an invasion  of Scotland? A committee was appointed, consisting of the three warriors  above-named with St. John and Whitelock, to confer with the Lord-General  and satisfy him of the lawfulness of the undertaking. The six met, and  having first prayed--Oliver praying first--they proceeded to a  discussion which may be read at length in Whitelock's _Memorials_, vol.  iii. p. 207. The substance of their talk was as follows: Fairfax's  scruple proved to be that both they and the Scots had joined in the  Solemn League and Covenant, and that, therefore, until Scotland assumed  the offensive, there was no cause for an invasion. Cromwell's retort,  after a preliminary quibble, was practical enough. \"War is inevitable.  Is it better to have it in the bowels of another's country or in one's  own? In one or other it must be.\" Fairfax's scruple, however, withstood  this battery, though it was strongly enforced by Harrison, who, in reply  to the Lord-General's question, \"What was the warrant for the assumption  that Scotland meant to fall upon England?\" inquired, if Scotland did not  mean to invade England, for whose benefit were levies being made and  soldiers enlisted.    Fairfax proved immovable. \"Every man,\" said he, \"must stand or fall by  his own conscience\"; and as he offered to lay down his command, there  was nothing for it but to accept the resignation and appoint his  successor. This was speedily done, and on the 28th of June 1650 \"Oliver  Cromwell, Esquire,\" was appointed Captain-General and Commander-in-chief  of all the forces. On 16th July Cromwell crossed the Tweed, and on the  3rd of September the Lord delivered Leslie into his hands at Dunbar.    It was in these circumstances that Lord Fairfax and his energetic lady  and only child went back to their Yorkshire home in the midsummer of  1650, taking Marvell with them to instruct the Lady Mary in the tongues.    Nunappleton House is in the Ainstey of York, a pleasant bit of country  bounded by the rivers Ouse, Wharfe, and Nidd. The modern traveller, as  his train rushes north, whilst shut up in his corridor-carriage with his  rug, his pipe, and his novel, passes at no great distance from the house  on the way between Selby and York. The old house, as it was in Marvell's  time, is thus described by Captain Markham, who had a print to help  him, in his delightful _Life of the Great Lord Fairfax_:--       \"It was a picturesque brick mansion with stone copings and a high     steep roof, and consisted of a centre and two wings at right angles,     forming three sides of a square, facing to the north. The great hall     or gallery occupied the centre between the two wings. It was fifty     yards long, and was adorned with thirty shields in wood, painted with     the arms of the family. In the three rooms there were chimney-pieces     of delicate marble of various colours, and many fine portraits on the     walls. The central part of the house was surrounded by a cupola, and     clustering chimneys rose in the two wings. A noble park with splendid     oak-trees, and containing 300 head of deer, stretched away to the     north, while on the south side were the ruins of the old Nunnery, the     flower-garden, and the low meadows called _ings_ extending to the     banks of the Wharfe. In this flower-garden the General took especial     delight. The flowers were planted in masses, tulips, pinks, and     roses, each in separate beds, which were cut into the shape of forts     with five bastions. General Lambert, whom Fairfax had reared as a     soldier, also loved his flowers, and excelled both in cultivating     them and in painting them from Nature. Lord Fairfax only went to     Denton, the favourite seat of his grandfather, when the floods were     out over the _ings_ at Nunappleton, and he also occasionally resorted     to his house at Bishop Hill in York.\"[31:1]    In this garden the muse of Andrew Marvell blossomed like the  cherry-tree.    Lord Fairfax, though furious in war, and badly wounded in many a fierce  engagement, was, when otherwise occupied, a man of quiet literary  tastes, and a good bit of a collector and _virtuoso_. Some of the rare  books and manuscripts he had around him at Nunappleton are now in the  Bodleian, the treasures of which he had protected in troubled times. He  loved to handle medals and coins, and knew the points of old  engravings. He wrote a history of the Christian Church down to our own  ill-conducted Reformation, and composed a complete metrical version of  the Psalms of David and of the Song of Solomon. These and many other  productions, which he characterised as \"The Employment of my Solitude,\"  still remain in his own handwriting. Amongst them, Yorkshire men will  hear with pleasure, is a \"Treatise on the breeding of the Horse.\"    Of the quality of his wife we have already had a touch. She was one of  the four daughters of Lord Vere of Tilbury, who came of a fine fighting  family, and whose daughters had a roughish bringing-up, chiefly in the  Netherlands. None of the daughters were reckoned beautiful, either in  face or figure, and it may well be that Lady Fairfax had something about  her of the old campaigner; but of her courage, sincerity, and goodness  there can be no question. Her loyalty was no sickly fruit of \"Church  Principles,\" for her strong intelligence rejected scornfully the slavish  doctrines, alien to our political constitution, of divine right and  passive obedience; but a loyalty, none the less, it was, of a very  valuable kind. She was fond of argument, and with Lady Fairfax at  Nunappleton there was never likely to be any dearth of sensible talk and  lively reminiscence. The tragedy of the 30th of January could never be  forgotten, and it is possible that Marvell's most famous verses, so  nobly descriptive of the demeanour of the king on that memorable  occasion, derived their inspiration from discourse at Nunappleton.    Of the Lady Mary, aged twelve, we have no direct testimony. When she  grew up and had her portrait painted she stands revealed as a stout  young woman with a plain good-natured face. The poor soul needed all  the good-nature heaven had bestowed upon her, for she had to bear the  misery and disgrace which were the inevitable marriage-portion of the  woman whose ill-luck it was to become the wife of George Villiers,  second Duke of Buckingham. Somebody seems to have taught her philosophy,  for she bore her misfortunes as best became a great lady, living as one  who had sorrow but no grievance. The duke died in 1688; she lived on  till 1704. She was ever a good friend to another ill-used solitary wife,  Catherine of Braganza. Marvell had every reason to be proud of his  pupil.    Beside the actual inmates of the great house, the whole countryside  swarmed with Fairfaxes. At the Rectory of Bolton Percy was the late  Lord-General's uncle, Henry Fairfax, and his two sons, Henry, who  succeeded to the title, and the better-known Brian, the biographer of  the Duke of Buckingham. At Stenton, four miles off, lived the widow of  the gallant Sir William Fairfax, who died, covered with wounds, in 1644  before Montgomery Castle. There were two sons and two daughters at  Stenton, whilst Charles Fairfax, another uncle, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#6)"],[1," of herself. Here was another locked door  added to the hundred in the strange house.    \"Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won't let no  one go inside. It was her garden. He locked th' door an' dug a hole and  buried th' key. There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must run.\"    After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in  the shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no one  had been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like and  whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passed  through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide  lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, and  flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large  pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds were  bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not the  garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You could  always walk into a garden.    She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she  was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.  She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming  upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.  She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the  ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently,  and she could go into it.    She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all  round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed  to open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealing  bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.  Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the  beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary  thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summer  when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.    Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the  door leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw  Mary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not  seem at all pleased to see her--but then she was displeased with his  garden and wore her \"quite contrary\" expression, and certainly did not  seem at all pleased to see him.    \"What is this place?\" she asked.    \"One o' th' kitchen-gardens,\" he answered.    \"What is that?\" said Mary, pointing through the other green door.    \"Another of 'em,\" shortly. \"There's another on t'other side o' th' wall  an' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that.\"    \"Can I go in them?\" asked Mary.    \"If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see.\"    Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the second  green door. There she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass  frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was  not open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten  years. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she  wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. She  hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had  found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she walked  through it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round  it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees  growing in the winter-browned grass--but there was no green door to be  seen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the  upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to  end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place  at the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and  when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on  the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter  song--almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.    She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly  little whistle gave her a pleased feeling--even a disagreeable little  girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big  bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the  world but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had been  used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though  she was \"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\" she was desolate, and the  bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face  which was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He was  not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should  ever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew  all about it.    Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought  so much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to  see what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If he  had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered if  she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not  like him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and  stare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to  ask him why he had done such a queer thing.    \"People never like me and I never like people,\" she thought. \"And I  never can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talking  and laughing and making noises.\"    She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at  her, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather  suddenly on the path.    \"I believe that tree was in the secret garden--I feel sure it was,\" she  said. \"There was a wall round the place and there was no door.\"    She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found  the old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watched  him a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her and  so at last she spoke to him.    \"I have been into the other gardens,\" she said.    \"There was nothin' to prevent thee,\" he answered crustily.    \"I went into the orchard.\"    \"There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,\" he answered.    \"There was no door there into the other garden,\" said Mary.    \"What garden?\" he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a  moment.    \"The one on the other side of the wall,\" answered Mistress Mary. \"There  are trees there--I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast was  sitting on one of them and he sang.\"    To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its  expression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite  different. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person  looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.    He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to  whistle--a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly  man could make such a coaxing sound.    Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a soft  little rushing flight through the air--and it was the bird with the red  breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth  quite near to the gardener's foot.    \"Here he is,\" chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if  he were speaking to a child.    \"Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?\" he said. \"I've not  seen thee before to-day. Has tha' begun tha' courtin' this early in th'  season? Tha'rt too forrad.\"    The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his  soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiar  and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly,  looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in  her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a  person. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender  delicate legs.    \"Will he always come when you call him?\" she asked almost in a whisper.    \"Aye, that he will. I've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. He  come out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he flew over  th' wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we got  friendly. When he went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was  gone an' he was lonely an' he come back to me.\"    \"What kind of a bird is he?\" Mary asked.    \"Doesn't tha' know? He's a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest,  curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs--if you know  how to get on with 'em. Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin' round  at us now an' again. He knows we're talkin' about him.\"    It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He looked  at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud  and fond of him.    \"He's a conceited one,\" he chuckled. \"He likes to hear folk talk about  him. An' curious--bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an'  meddlin'. He's always comin' to see what I'm plantin'. He knows all th'  things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out. He's th' head  gardener, he is.\"    The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped  and looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed  at her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out  all about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.    \"Where did the rest of the brood fly to?\" she asked.    \"There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make  'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it. This one was a knowin'  one an' he knew he was lonely.\"    Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very  hard.    \"I'm lonely,\" she said.    She had not known before that this was "]]]
