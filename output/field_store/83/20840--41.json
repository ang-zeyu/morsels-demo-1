There is very little mangrove, but another  enclosed piece of water to the south of this probably has more. The  language of the people here is Swaheli; they trade a little in  gum-copal and Orchilla weed. An agent of the Zanzibar custom-house  presides over the customs, which are very small, and a jemidar  acknowledging the Sultan is the chief authority; but the people are  little superior to the natives whom they have displaced. The jemidar  has been very civil to me, and gives me two guides to go on to Adonde,  but no carriers can be hired. Water is found in wells in the coral  rock which underlies the whole place.    _4th April, 1866._--When about to start from Pemba, at the entrance to  the other side of the bay one of our buffaloes gored a donkey so  badly that he had to be shot: we cut off the tips of the offender's  horns, on the principle of \"locking the stable-door when the steed is  stolen,\" and marched. We came to level spots devoid of vegetation, and  hard on the surface, but a deposit of water below allowed the camels  to sink up to their bodies through the crust. Hauling them out, we got  along to the jemidar's house, which is built of coral and lime. Hamesh  was profuse in his professions of desire to serve, but gave a shabby  hut which let in rain and wind. I slept one night in it, and it was  unbearable, so I asked the jemidar to allow me to sleep in his  court-room, where many of the sepoys were: he consented, but when I  went refused; then, being an excitable, nervous Arab, he took fright,  mustered all his men, amounting to about fifteen, with matchlocks; ran  off, saying he was going to kill a lion; came back, shook hands  nervously with me, vowing it was a man who would not obey him, \"it was  not you.\"    Our goods were all out in the street, bound on the pack-saddles, so at  night we took the ordinary precaution of setting a guard. This excited  our dignitary, and after dark all his men were again mustered with  matches lighted. I took no notice of him, and after he had spent a  good deal of talk, which we could hear, he called Musa and asked what  I meant. The explanations of Musa had the effect of sending him to  bed, and in the morning, when I learned how much I had most  unintentionally disturbed him, I told him that I was sorry, but it did  not occur to me to tell him about an ordinary precaution against  thieves. He thought he had given me a crushing reply when he said with  vehemence, \"But there are no thieves here.\" I did not know till  afterwards that he and others had done me an ill turn in saying that  no carriers could be hired from the independent tribes adjacent. They  are low-coast Arabs, three-quarters African, and, as usual, possess  the bad without the good qualities of both parents. Many of them came  and begged brandy, and laughed when they remarked that they could  drink it in secret but not openly; they have not, however, introduced  it as an article of trade, as we Christians have done on the West  Coast.    _6th April, 1866._--We made a short march round to the south-west side  of the Lake, and spent the night at a village in that direction. There  are six villages dotted round the inner harbour, and the population  may amount to 250 or 300 souls--coast Arabs and their slaves; the  southern portion of the harbour is deep, from ten to fourteen fathoms,  but the north-western part is shoal and rocky. Very little is done in  the way of trade; some sorghum, sem-sem seed, gum-copal, and orchilla  weed, constitute the commerce of the port: I saw two Banian traders  settled here.    _7th April, 1866._--Went about south from Kindany with a Somalie  guide, named Ben Ali or Bon Ali, a good-looking obliging man, who was  to get twenty dollars to take us up to Ngomano. Our path lay in a  valley, with well-wooded heights on each side, but the grass towered  over our heads, and gave the sensation of smothering, whilst the sun  beat down on our heads very fiercely, and there was not a breath of  air stirring. Not understanding camels, I had to trust to the sepoys  who overloaded them, and before we had accomplished our march of about  seven miles they were knocked up.    _8th April, 1866._--We spent the Sunday at a village called Nyangedi.  Here on the evening of the 7th April our buffaloes and camels were  first bitten by the tsetse fly.[5] We had passed through some pieces  of dense jungle which, though they offered no obstruction to  foot-passengers, but rather an agreeable shade, had to be cut for the  tall camels, and fortunately we found the Makonde of this village  glad to engage themselves by the day either as woodcutters or  carriers. We had left many things with the jemidar from an idea that  no carriers could be procured. I lightened the camels, and had a party  of woodcutters to heighten and widen the path in the dense jungle into  which we now penetrated. Every now and then we emerged on open spaces,  where the Makonde have cleared gardens for sorghum, maize, and  cassava. The people were very much more taken up with the camels and  buffaloes than with me. They are all independent of each other, and no  paramount chief exists. Their foreheads may be called compact, narrow,  and rather low; the _alae nasi_ expanded laterally; lips full, not  excessively thick; limbs and body well formed; hands and feet small;  colour dark and light-brown; height middle size, and bearing  independent.    _10th April, 1866._--We reached a village called Narri, lat. 10 deg. 23'  14\" S. Many of the men had touches of fever. I gave medicine to eleven  of them, and next morning all were better. Food is abundant and cheap.  Our course is nearly south, and in \"wadys,\" from which, following the  trade-road, we often ascend the heights, and then from the villages,  which are on the higher land, we descend to another on the same wady.  No running water is seen; the people depend on wells for a supply.    _11th April, 1866._--At Tandahara we were still ascending as we went  south; the soil is very fertile, with a good admixture of sand in it,  but no rocks are visible. Very heavy crops of maize and sorghum are  raised, and the cassava bushes are seven feet in height. The bamboos  are cleared off them, spread over the space to be cultivated and  burned to serve as manure. Iron is very scarce, for many of the men  appear with wooden spears; they find none here, but in some spots  where an ooze issued from the soil iron rust appeared. At each of the  villages where we spent a night we presented a fathom of calico, and  the headman always gave a fowl or two, and a basket of rice or maize.  The Makonde dialect is quite different from Swaheli, but from their  intercourse with the coast Arabs many of the people here have acquired  a knowledge of Swaheli.    [Illustration: A Thorn-climber.]    _12th April, 1866._--On starting we found the jungle so dense that the  people thought \"there was no cutting it:\" it continued upwards of  three miles. The trees are not large, but so closely planted together  that a great deal of labour was required to widen and heighten the  path: where bamboos prevail they have starved out the woody trees. The  reason why the trees are not large is because all the spaces we passed  over were formerly garden ground before the Makonde had been thinned  by the slave-trade. As soon as a garden is deserted, a thick crop of  trees of the same sorts as those formerly cut down springs up, and  here the process of woody trees starving out their fellows, and  occupying the land without dense scrub below, has not had time to work  itself out. Many are mere poles, and so intertwined with climbers as  to present the appearance of a ship's ropes and cables shaken in among  them, and many have woody stems as thick as an eleven-inch hawser. One  species may be likened to the scabbard of a dragoon's sword, but along  the middle of the flat side runs a ridge, from which springs up every  few inches a bunch of inch-long straight sharp thorns. It hangs  straight for a couple of yards, but as if it could not give its thorns  a fair chance of mischief, it suddenly bends on itself, and all its  cruel points are now at right angles to what they were before.  Darwin's observation shows a great deal of what looks like instinct in  these climbers. This species seems to be eager for mischief; its  tangled limbs hang out ready to inflict injury on all passers-by.  Another climber is so tough it is not to be broken by the fingers;  another appears at its root as a young tree, but it has the straggling  habits of its class, as may be seen by its cords stretched some fifty  or sixty feet off; it is often two inches in diameter; you cut it  through at one part and find it reappear forty yards off.    [Illustration: Tomahawk and Axe.]    Another climber is like the leaf of an aloe, but convoluted as  strangely as shavings from the plane of a carpenter. It is dark green  in colour, and when its bark is taken off it is beautifully striated  beneath, lighter and darker green, like the rings of growth on wood;  still another is a thin string with a succession of large knobs, and  another has its bark pinched up all round at intervals so as to  present a great many cutting edges. One sort need scarcely be  mentioned, in which all along its length are strong bent hooks, placed  in a way that will hold one if it can but grapple with him, for that  is very common and not like those mentioned, which the rather seem to  be stragglers from the carboniferous period of geologists, when  Pachydermata wriggled unscathed among tangled masses worse than these.  We employed about ten jolly young Makonde to deal with these  prehistoric plants in their own way, for they are accustomed to  clearing spaces for gardens, and went at the work with a will, using  tomahawks well adapted for the work. They whittled away right  manfully, taking an axe when any trees had to be cut. Their pay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#6)"],[1,"de Breaute was confirmed in  the custody of a compact group of six midland shires, besides the  earldom of Devon, and the \"county of the Isle of Wight,\"[1] which he  guarded in the interests of his wife and stepson. Savary de Mauleon, who  in despair of his old master's success had crossed over to Poitou before  John's death, was made warden of the castle of Bristol. Randolph of  Chester was consoled for the loss of the regency by the renewal of  John's recent grant of the Honour of Lancaster which was by this time  definitely recognised as a shire.[2]        [1] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie_, etc., p. 181.        [2] Tait, _Medieval Manchester and the Beginnings of      Lancashire_, p. 180.    The war assumed the character of a crusade. The royalist troops wore  white crosses on their garments, and were assured by the clergy of  certain salvation. The cruel and purposeless ravaging of the enemy's  country, which had occupied John's last months of life, became rare,  though partisans, such as Falkes de Breaute, still outvied the French  in plundering monasteries and churches. The real struggle became a war  of castles. Louis endeavoured to complete his conquest of the  south-east by the capture of the royal strongholds, which still limited  his power to the open country. At first the French prince had some  successes. In November he increased his hold on the Home counties by  capturing the Tower of London, by forcing Hertford to surrender, and by  pressing the siege of Berkhampsted. As Christmas approached the  royalists proposed a truce. Louis agreed on the condition that  Berkhampsted should be surrendered, and early in 1217 both parties held  councils, the royalists at Oxford and the barons at Cambridge. There  was vague talk of peace, but the war was renewed, and Louis captured  Hedingham and Orford in Essex, and besieged the castles of Colchester  and Norwich. Then another truce until April 26 was concluded, on the  condition that the royalists should surrender these two strongholds.    Both sides had need to pause. Louis, at the limit of his resources, was  anxious to obtain men and money from France. He was not getting on well  with his new subjects. The eastern counties grumbled at his taxes.  Dissensions arose between the English and French elements in his host.  The English lords resented the grants and appointments he gave to his  countrymen. The French nobles professed to despise the English as  traitors. When Hertford was taken, Robert FitzWalter demanded that its  custody should be restored to him. Louis roughly told him that  Englishmen, who had betrayed their natural lord, were not to be  entrusted with such charges. It was to little purpose that he promised  Robert that every man should have his rights when the war was over. The  prospects of ending the war grew more remote every day. The royalists  took advantage of the discouragement of their opponents. The regent was  lavish in promises. There should be no inquiry into bygones, and all  who submitted to the young king should be guaranteed all their existing  rights. The result was that a steady stream of converts began to flow  from the camp of Louis to the camp of the marshal. For the first time  signs of a national movement against Louis began to be manifest. It  became clear that his rule meant foreign conquest.    Louis wished to return to France, but despite the truce he could only  win his way to the coast by fighting. The Cinque Ports were changing  their allegiance. A popular revolt had broken out in the Weald, where a  warlike squire, William of Cassingham,[1] soon became a terror to the  French under his nickname of Wilkin of the Weald. As Louis traversed the  disaffected districts, Wilkin fell upon him near Lewes, and took  prisoners two nephews of the Count of Nevers. On his further march to  Winchelsea, the men of the Weald broke down the bridges behind him,  while on his approach the men of Winchelsea destroyed their mills, and  took to their ships as avowed partisans of King Henry. The French prince  entered the empty town, and had great difficulty in keeping his army  alive. \"Wheat found they there,\" says a chronicler; \"in great plenty,  but they knew not how to grind it. Long time were they in such a plight  that they had to crush by hand the corn of which they made their bread.  They could catch no fish. Great store of nuts found they in the town;  these were their finest food.\"[2] Louis was in fact besieged by the  insurgents, and was only released by a force of knights riding down from  London to help him. These troops dared not travel by the direct road  through the Weald, and made their way to Romney through Canterbury. Rye  was strongly held against them and the ships of the Cinque Ports  dominated the sea, so that Louis was still cut off from his friends at  Romney. A relieving fleet was despatched from Boulogne, but stress of  weather kept it for a fortnight at Dover, while Louis was starving at  Winchelsea. At last the French ships appeared off Winchelsea. Thereupon  the English withdrew, and Louis finding the way open to France returned  home.        [1] Mr. G.J. Turner has identified Cassingham with the modern      Kensham, between Rolvenden and Sandhurst, in Kent.        [2] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie_, etc., p. 183.    A crowd of waverers changed sides. At their head were William  Longsword, Earl of Salisbury, the bastard great-uncle of the little  king, and William, the young marshal, the eldest son of the Earl of  Pembroke. The regent wandered from town to town in Sussex, receiving  the submission of the peasantry, and venturing to approach as near  London as Dorking. The victorious Wilkin was made Warden of the Seven  Hundreds of the Weald. The greatest of the magnates of Sussex and  Surrey, William, Earl Warenne, followed the example of his tenantry,  and made his peace with the king. The royalists fell upon the few  castles held by the barons. While one corps captured Odiham, Farnham,  Chichester, and other southern strongholds, Falkes de Breaute overran  the Isle of Ely, and Randolph of Chester besieged the Leicestershire  fortress of Mount Sorrel. Enguerrand de Coucy, whom Louis had left in  command, remained helpless in London. His boldest act was to send a  force to Lincoln, which occupied the town, but failed to take the  castle. This stronghold, under its hereditary warden, the valiant old  lady, Nichola de Camville,[1] had already twice withstood a siege.        [1] On Nichola de Camville or de la Hay see M. Petit-Dutaillis      in _Melanges Julien Havet_, pp. 369-80.    Louis found no great encouragement in France, for Philip Augustus, too  prudent to offend the Church, gave but grudging support to his  excommunicated son. When, on the eve of the expiration of the truce,  Louis returned to England, his reinforcements comprised only 120  knights. Among them, however, were the Count of Brittany, Peter  Mauclerc, anxious to press in person his rights to the earldom of  Richmond, the Counts of Perche and Guines, and many lords of Picardy,  Artois and Ponthieu. Conscious that everything depended on the speedy  capture of the royal castles, Louis introduced for the first time into  England the _trebuchet_, a recently invented machine that cast great  missiles by means of heavy counterpoises. \"Great was the talk about  this, for at that time few of them had been seen in France.\"[1] On April  22, Louis reached Dover, where the castle was still feebly beset by the  French. On his nearing the shore, Wilkin of the Weald and Oliver, a  bastard of King John's, burnt the huts of the French engaged in watching  the castle. Afraid to land in their presence, Louis disembarked at  Sandwich. Next day he went by land to Dover, but discouraged by tidings  of his losses, he gladly concluded a short truce with Hubert de Burgh.  He abandoned the siege of Dover, and hurried off towards Winchester,  where the two castles were being severely pressed by the royalists. But  his progress was impeded by his siege train, and Farnham castle blocked  his way.        [1] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie, etc._, p. 188; cf.      _English Hist. Review_, xviii. (1903), 263-64.    Saer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, joined Louis outside the walls of  Farnham. Saer's motive was to persuade Louis to hasten to the relief of  his castle of Mount Sorrel. The French prince was not in a position to  resist pressure from a powerful supporter. He divided his army, and  while the Earl of Winchester, along with the Count of Perche and Robert  FitzWalter, made their way to Leicestershire, he completed his journey  to Winchester, threw a fresh force into the castles, and, leaving the  Count of Nevers in charge, hurried to London. There he learnt that  Hubert de Burgh at Dover had broken the truce, and he at once set off  to renew the siege of the stronghold which had so continually baulked  his plans. But little good came of his efforts, and the much-talked-of  _trebuchet_ proving powerless to effect a breach, Louis had to resign  himself to a weary blockade. While he was besieging Dover, Saer de  Quincy had relieved Mount Sorrel, whence he marched to the help of  Gilbert of Ghent, the only English baron whom Louis ventured to raise  to comital rank as Earl of Lincoln. Gilbert was still striving to  capture Lincoln Castle, but Nichola de Camville had resisted him from  February to May. With the help of the army from Mount Sorrel, the  castle and its _chatelaine_ were soon reduced to great straits.    The marshal saw that the time was come to take the offensive, and  resolved to raise the siege. Having no field army, he stripped his  castles of their garrisons, and gave rendezvous to his barons at  Newark. There the royalists rested three days, and received the  blessing of Gualo and the bishops. They then set out towards Lincoln,  commanded by the regent in person, the Earl of Chester, and the Bishop  of Winchester, whom the legate"]]]
