RENAUD CAVE    Four miles east of Edgar Springs, facing Little Piney, is Renaud  (R[)e]n'n[=o]) Cave, on the farm of Charles E. Widener. The entrance  is 50 feet wide and 10 feet high. Dry cave earth extends back for 65  feet, then comes fallen rock for 100 feet or more. A little stream  runs close to the north wall. Cave earth is 5 feet deep on the bedrock  at the entrance and rises toward the interior. There is much refuse  within and also on the slope in front of the entrance.      MARSH CAVES    A shelter cave on Henry Marsh's farm, facing Little Piney, 2 miles  south of Yancy Mills, has a front 35 feet wide, 15 feet high, and runs  back 60 feet. There is a wet-weather stream bed through the center.  Bedrock shows at the entrance, rising toward the rear for a few feet,  then becoming covered with cave earth, which probably has a maximum  thickness of 2 feet. There is considerable refuse scattered about, but  it is doubtful whether the shallow deposit would repay investigation.      WILD-HOG CAVE    A fourth of a mile from the above cave is one known as \"Wild-hog  Cave,\" because in pioneer days these animals gathered here for shelter  and protection. It is a small, tunnel-like affair, with a solid rock  floor, and extends farther into the hill than anyone has ever dared to  venture.      SHELTERS    Two small rock shelters near the Wild-hog Cave may have been resorted  to as temporary camping places.      PHELPS CAVE    A cave on the farm of James Phelps, 2 miles south of Yancy Mills, is  described as small, with a narrow entrance.      \"KEY ROCKS\"    Near Yancy Mills there is something known as \"the Key Rocks.\" It can  not be found by a stranger and no guide was available at the time the  place was sought. It is described as a small, deep, circular hole in  solid rock, in which were many stone covers or lids, one above  another, gradually diminishing in size and \"cut to fit down on each  other.\" It is probably due to stream erosion.      JONES CAVE    On Little Piney, half a mile south from Yancy Mills, is a large cave  on the Jones farm. It is said to have a large entrance and much earth  on the floor. As the owner uses it for a warehouse in which to store  fruits and vegetables and utilizes the stream flowing through it for  preserving milk and butter, no examination could be made.      YANCY MILLS CAVE    There is a small, shallow cave near the top of the bluff, half a mile  north of Yancy Mills. It contains no evidence of occupation, except  that walls and ceiling are blackened with smoke, due, probably, to  modern refugees or hunters.      LANE MOUND (7)    It was reported, too late to visit the site, that on George Lane's  farm, on Little Piney, a mile north of Yancy Mills, is a mound \"8 feet  high, built of earth,\" and surrounded with the usual evidences of a  village site, scattered over the level bottom on which it stands.      CAIRNS ON LOST HILL, AT MOUTH OF GOURD CREEK (8)    Gourd Creek flows into the east side of Little Piney River 12 miles  southwest of Rolla. It is less than 4 miles long, and but for three or  four large springs near its source, which keep its volume fairly  uniform, would be dry most of the year.    Parallel with it, a short distance to the southward, is a ravine  several miles in length, known as Coal Pit Hollow. This originally  discharged its drainage into Little Piney about half a mile above the  mouth of Gourd Creek. A ravine tributary to the latter, near its  mouth, has worked back until it has captured the flow of Coal Pit. The  lower end of the stream bed thus abandoned now forms a gap or  depression with a slight incline from the center in both directions.  The crest of the deserted portion is about 50 to 60 feet above the  present level of Little Piney. The hill inclosed by this quadrilateral  drainage is about a fourth of a mile in length along its top, has a  direction almost north and south, with a nearly uniform slope along  the summit, the southern point being somewhat higher than that at the  north, and terminates abruptly at each end. The sides descend at once  from the center line of the ridge, like a roof with a slightly rounded  comb.    On account of its isolated position the eminence is locally known as  \"Lost Hill.\" It is not to be confused, however, with several similar  formations in this region, to which the same term is applied and which  may owe their existence to a like cause, or may be due to cut-offs by  streams.    On the top of this particular Lost Hill are six cairns, five of them  near the northern end, the sixth just where the ridge breaks off to  the south. The margins are uncertain owing to the upper stones being  scattered by hunters as well as by credulous individuals who are  firmly fixed in the belief that all such \"rock piles\" contain gold  hidden by Indians.    So far as can now be determined the five at the northern end were 16  to 18 feet across as left by the builders, the southernmost one being  somewhat smaller. All are in uncleared land, and crevices between the  stones are filled with a tangled mass of roots from the trees and  bushes growing on and around them.    The relative positions are about thus, measurements being made on the  earth between the scattered stones: (1) 10 feet, (2) 10 feet, (3) 50  feet, (4) 10 feet, (5) 1,000 feet, (6). The distance from (5) to (6)  is estimated by stepping and may vary considerably either way from the  measure given.    Cairns (1), (2), and (3) were thoroughly excavated.      CAIRN (1)    This, the farthest north, was about 16 by 17 feet within the original  limits. When the outer loose rocks were removed there was disclosed a  wall of flat stones on the natural surface, so laid as to form an  inclosure apparently intended to be practically square. It measured,  across the center, from outside to outside, about 14 feet from north  to south by 12 feet from east to west. The north and south walls were  straight, the others outwardly curved. The approximate outline is  shown in figure 1. In most parts the wall was only one stone high; in  a few places there was another rock laid up. Over and within this wall  had been piled loose stones, ranging in size from small pebbles to  fragments of 150 pounds in weight, to form a heap whose original  height was about 2 feet.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Outline of Cairn (1), at Lost Hill, Phelps    County, Mo.]    When all these were cleared away the space within the wall was found  to measure 9 feet in each direction. Three feet from the middle of the  west wall was a fragment of a child's skull lying on the undisturbed  angular gravel which forms the natural surface on this ridge except  where a small amount of recently decayed humus may be held by rocks  and roots. Halfway between the center and the north wall was the top  of an adult skull, with three fragments of long bones. These, which  were much gnawed by rodents, were in black earth, evidently the former  home of some burrowing animal.    A foot north of the infant's skull were small remnants of an adult's  skull, probably belonging with the piece first found. There were also  some scraps of animal bones, much gnawed.      CAIRN (2)    This measured from 16 to 18 feet across to the outer edge of the loose  stones, and about 30 inches high. Under the top rocks was a rough wall  similar to that in Cairn (1), but all the sides were nearly straight.  The outline is given in figure 2. The outside measurements, across the  center, were 15 feet each way. There were more stones in this wall  than in the first; mostly there were two, and in some places three,  superposed.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Outline of Cairn (2), at Lost Hill, Phelps    County, Mo.]    Extending from north to south across the middle of the vault was a row  of large slabs standing on edge with their tops leaning toward the  east. Their inclination varied from nearly horizontal to nearly  vertical; so it would appear that they were not placed thus  intentionally but had settled irregularly. Probably they had formed  the covering of a pen or vault, of poles or timbers, in which a body  had been placed.    Close to these inclined slabs, near the north wall of the vault, was  the effigy pipe shown in figure 3. It is made of a fine-grained  sandstone and seems intended to represent a buzzard with an  exaggerated tail, though the beak is more like that of a crow. This  specimen lay between two flat rocks which were separated by a little  earth and gravel, but there were no traces of bone with it or near it.      [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Pipe from Cairn (2).]    At a slightly lower level than the pipe were several flat stones  standing at various angles. When these were removed there were found  fragmentary remains of at least three adults, lying in confusion, as  if only the folded dismembered skeletons had been placed here. They  lay on a floor of slabs which, in turn, rested upon undisturbed  gravel.    The facts observed are difficult to interpret, as the original order  was so broken up; but it would seem that as a preliminary to the  burial of bodies or skeletons, the superficial earth had been scraped  away and a rough stone floor laid, on which the bundled or folded  remains were placed and at least partially covered with earth and  gravel. Other flat rocks were then laid over them, either directly on  the earth or more probably supported by poles placed across, whose  decay had allowed them to fall into the confusion in which they were  found.    A small flint knife was among the remains.    The pipe, being at a little distance from these bones, would suggest  another interment; but as no trace of such remained it may have been  placed as an afterthought or a separate deposit.    From these skeletons row after row of the slanting rocks continued to  the inner side of the eastern wall.

Twelve of the children are  illegitimate. The husband of daughter No. 6 is also the father of one  each of the offspring of daughters Nos. 2 and 3. Most of the children  are delicate and poorly developed, and at least six of them are  definitely tubercular. The remainder are either neurotic or erratic in  their conduct and have given a great deal of trouble in their  upbringing. The total cost to the State for the maintenance of these  children may be quoted at L10,000, but of this amount L482 has been  recovered from the various men liable. It is difficult to assess the  State's total commitment. If some of the children have to be maintained  until they reach the age of twenty-one the additional cost will be  L3,000. There is the probability, too, that the offspring of these  children will become charges upon the State.                           _Case No. 4._          +--------------------+---------------------+          | Father:            | Mother:             |          |  Addicted to drink |  Drunkard and       |          |  and degenerate.   |  morally deficient. |          |                    |                     |    +------------------------------------+----------------+    |                                    |    Female,     |    |                                    |   born 1908.   |    |                                    +----------------+    |                                    |     Male,      |    |                                    |   born 1909.   |    |All these children are illegitimate |Admitted special|    |and are feeble-minded, requiring    | school, 1920.  |    |lifelong control.
