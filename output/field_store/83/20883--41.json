We must look, not to the royal studios, but to the workshops connected  with the necropolis, if we want to find statues of half life-size  displaying intelligent workmanship, all of which we might be tempted to  refer to the XVIIIth dynasty if the inscriptions upon them did not fix  their date some two or three centuries later. An example of them may be  seen at Turin in the kneeling scribe embracing a ram-headed altar:  the face is youthful, and has an expression at once so gentle and  intelligent that we are constrained to overlook the imperfections in the  bust and legs of the figure. Specimens of this kind are not numerous,  and their rarity is easily accounted for. The multitude of priests,  soldiers, workmen, and small middle-class people who made up the bulk of  the Theban population had aspirations for a luxury little commensurate  with their means, and the tombs of such people are, therefore, full  of objects which simulate a character they do not possess, and are  deceptive to the eye: such were the statuettes made of wood, substituted  from economical motives instead of the limestone or sandstone statues  usually provided as supporters for the \"double.\"    [Illustration: 041a.jpg YOUNG GIRL IN THE TURING MUSEUM]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.

Enamelled eyes, according to a common custom, were inserted       in the sockets, but have disappeared.    The funerary sculptors had acquired a perfect mastery of the kind of  art needed for people of small means, and we find among the medley of  commonplace objects which encumber the tomb they decorated, examples of  artistic works of undoubted excellence, such as the ladies Nai and Tui  now in the Louvre, the lady Nehai now at Berlin, and the naked child at  Turin. The lady Tui in her lifetime had been one of the singing-women of  Amon. She is clad in a tight-fitting robe, which accentuates the  contour of the breasts and hips without coarseness: her right arm falls  gracefully alongside her body, while her left, bent across her chest,  thrusts into her bosom a kind of magic whip, which was the sign of her  profession. The artist was not able to avoid a certain heaviness in the  treatment of her hair, and the careful execution of the whole work was  not without a degree of harshness, but by dint of scraping and polishing  the wood he succeeded in softening the outline, and removing from the  figure every sharp point. The lady Nehai is smarter and more graceful,  in her close-fitting garment and her mantle thrown over the left elbow;  and the artist has given her a more alert pose and resolute air than we  find in the stiff carriage of her contemporary Tui. The little girl in  the Turin Museum is a looser work, but where could one find a better  example of the lithe delicacy of the young Egyptian maiden of eight or  ten years old? We may see her counterpart to-day among the young Nubian  girls of the cataract, before they are obliged to wear clothes; there is  the same thin chest, the same undeveloped hips, the same meagre thighs,  and the same demeanour, at once innocent and audacious. Other statuettes  represent matrons, some in tight garments, and with their hair closely  confined, others without any garment whatever.

[Illustration: 043b.jpg STATUE IN THE TURIN MUSEUM]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Petrie.    The Turin example is that of a lady who seems proud of her large  ear-rings, and brings one of them into prominence, either to show it  off or to satisfy herself that the jewel becomes her: her head is  square-shaped, the shoulders narrow, the chest puny, the pose of the  arm stiff and awkward, but the eyes have such a joyful openness, and her  smile such a self-satisfied expression, that one readily over looks the  other defects of the statue. In this collection of miniature figures  examples of men are not wanting, and there are instances of old  soldiers, officials, guardians of temples, and priests proudly executing  their office in their distinctive panther skins. Three individuals in  the Gizeh were contemporaries, or almost so, of the young girl of the  Turin Museum. They are dressed in rich costumes, to which they have,  doubtless, a just claim; for one of them, Hori, surnamed Ra, rejoiced in  the favour of the Pharaoh, and must therefore have exercised some  court function. They seem to step forth with a measured pace and firm  demeanour, the body well thrown back and the head erect, their  faces displaying something of cruelty and cunning. An officer, whose  retirement from service is now spent in the Louvre, is dressed in a  semi-civil costume, with a light wig, a closely fitting smock-frock  with shirt-sleeves, and a loin-cloth tied tightly round the hips and  descending halfway down the thigh, to which is applied a piece of stuff  kilted lengthwise, projecting in front. A colleague of his, now in the  Berlin Museum, still maintains possession of his official baton, and is  arrayed in his striped petticoat, his bracelets and gorget of gold.  A priest in the Louvre holds before him, grasped by both hands, the  insignia of Amon-Ra--a ram's head, surmounted by the solar disk, and  inserted on the top of a thick handle; another, who has been relegated  to Turin, appears to be placed between two long staves, each surmounted  by an idol, and, to judge from his attitude, seems to have no small idea  of his own beauty and importance. The Egyptians were an observant  people and inclined to satire, and I have a shrewd suspicion that the  sculptors, in giving to such statuettes this character of childlike  vanity, yielded to the temptation to be merry at the expense of their  model.    The smelters and engravers in metal occupied in relation to the  sculptors a somewhat exalted position. Bronze had for a long time been  employed in funerary furniture, and _ushabtiu_ (respondents),* amulets,  and images of the gods, as well as of mortals, were cast in this metal.  Many of these tiny figures form charming examples of enamel-work, and  are distinguished not only by the gracefulness of the, modelling, but  also by the brilliance of the superimposed glaze; but the majority of  them were purely commercial articles, manufactured by the hundred from  the same models, and possibly cast, for centuries, from the same moulds  for the edification of the devout and of pilgrims.         * Bronze _respondents_ are somewhat rare, and most of those       which are to be found among the dealers are counterfeit. The       Gizeh Museum possesses two examples at least of indisputable       authenticity; both of these belong to the XXth dynasty.

We ought not, therefore, to be surprised if they are lacking in  originality; they are no more to be distinguished from each other than  the hundreds of coloured statuettes which one may find on the stalls of  modern dealers in religious statuary.    [Illustration: 046b.jpg The Lady Taksuhit]         From a bronze in the Museum at Athens    [Illustration: 046b.jpg-text]    Here and there among the multitude we may light upon examples showing  a marked individuality: the statuette of the lady Takushit, which now  forms one of the ornaments of the museum at Athens, is an instance. She  stands erect, one foot in advance, her right arm hanging at her side,  her left pressed against her bosom; she is arrayed in a short dress  embroidered over with religious scenes, and wears upon her ankles  and wrists rings of value. A wig with stiff-looking locks, regularly  arranged in rows, covers her head. The details of the drapery and the  ornaments are incised on the surface of the bronze, and heightened  with a thread of silver. The face is evidently a portrait, and is that  apparently of a woman of mature age, but the body, according to the  tradition of the Egyptian schools of art, is that of a young girl,  lithe, firm, and elastic. The alloy contains gold, and the warm and  softened lights reflected from it blend most happily and harmoniously  with the white lines of the designs. The joiners occupied, after the  workers in bronze, an important position in relation to the necropolis,  and the greater part of the furniture which they executed for the  mummies of persons of high rank was remarkable for its painting and  carpentry-work. Some articles of their manufacture were intended for  religious use--such as those shrines, mounted upon sledges, on which the  image of the god was placed, to whom prayers were made for the deceased;  others served for the household needs of the mummy, and, to distinguish  these, there are to be seen upon their sides religious and funereal  pictures, offerings to the two deceased parents, sacrifices to a god or  goddess, and incidents in the Osirian life. The funerary beds consisted,  like those intended for the living, of a rectangular framework, placed  upon four feet of equal height, although there are rare examples in  which the supports are so arranged as to give a gentle slope to the  structure. The fancy which actuated the joiner in making such beds  supposed that two benevolent lions had, of their own free will,  stretched out their bodies to form the two sides of the couch, the  muzzles constituting the pillow, while the tails were curled up under  the feet of the sleeper. Many of the heads given to the lions are so  noble and expressive, that they will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#6)"],[1,"the miserable state of the country twenty years previously.  Assyria then comprised two territories, one in the plains of the middle,  the other in the districts of the upper, Tigris, both of considerable  extent, but almost without regular intercommunication. Caravans or  isolated messengers might pass with tolerable safety from Assur and  Nineveh to Singar, or even to Nisibis; but beyond these places they  had to brave the narrow defiles and steep paths in the forests of the  Masios, through which it was rash to venture without keeping eye and  ear ever on the alert. The mountaineers and their chiefs recognized the  nominal suzerainty of Assyria, but refused to act upon this recognition  unless constrained by a strong hand; if this control were relaxed they  levied contributions on, or massacred, all who came within their reach,  and the king himself never travelled from his own city of Nineveh to his  own town of Amidi unless accompanied by an army. In less than the short  space of three years, Assur-nazir-pal had remedied this evil. By  the slaughter of some two hundred men in one place, three hundred in  another, two or three thousand in a third, by dint of impaling  and flaying refractory sheikhs, burning villages and dismantling  strongholds, he forced the marauders of Nairi and Kirkhi to respect his  frontiers and desist from pillaging his country. The two divisions  of his kingdom, strengthened by the military colonies in Nirbu, were  united, and became welded together into a compact whole from the banks  of the Lower Zab to the sources of the Khabur and the Supnat.    During the following season the course of events diverted the king's  efforts into quite an opposite direction (B.C. 882). Under the name of  Zamua there existed a number of small states scattered along the western  slope of the Iranian Plateau north of the Cossaeans.* Many of them--as,  for instance, the Lullume--had been civilized by the Chaldaeans almost  from time immemorial; the most southern among them were perpetually  oscillating between the respective areas of influence of Babylon and  Nineveh, according as one or other of these cities was in the ascendant,  but at this particular moment they acknowledged Assyrian sway. Were they  excited to rebellion against the latter power by the emissaries of  its rival, or did they merely think that Assur-nazir-pal was too  fully absorbed in the affairs of Nairi to be able to carry his arms  effectively elsewhere? At all events they coalesced under Nurramman,  the sheikh of Dagara, blocked the pass of Babiti which led to their  own territory, and there massed their contingents behind the shelter of  hastily erected ramparts.**         * According to Hommol and Tiele, Zamua would be the country       extending from the sources of the Radanu to the southern       shores of the lake of Urumiah; Schrader believes it to have       occupied a smaller area, and places it to the east and       south-west of the lesser Zab. Delattre has shown that a       distinction must be made between Zamua on Lake Van and the       well-known Zamua upon the Zab. Zamua, as described by Assur-       nazir-pal, answers approximately to the present sandjak of       Suleimaniyeh in the vilayet of Mossul.         ** Hommol believes that Assur-nazir-pal crossed the Zab near       Altin-keupru, and he is certainly correct: but it appears to       me from a passage in the _Annals_, that instead of taking       the road which leads to Bagdad by Ker-kuk and Tuz-Khurmati,       he marched along that which leads eastwards in the direction       of Suleimaniyeh. The pass of Babiti must have lain between       Gawardis and Biban, facing the Kisse tchai, which forms the       western branch of the Radanu. Dagara would thus be       represented by the district to the east of Kerkuk at the       foot of the Kara-dagh.    Assur-nazir-pal concentrated his army at Kakzi,* a little to the south  of Arbela, and promptly marched against them; he swept all obstacles  before him, killed fourteen hundred and sixty men at the first  onslaught, put Dagara to fire and sword, and soon defeated Nurramman,  but without effecting his capture.         * Kakzi, sometimes read Kalzi, must have been situated at       Shemamek of Shamamik, near Hazeh, to the south-west of       Erbil, the ancient Arbela, at the spot where Jones noticed       important Assyrian ruins excavated by Layard.    As the campaign threatened to be prolonged, he formed an entrenched  camp in a favourable position, and stationed in it some of his troops to  guard the booty, while he dispersed the rest to pillage the country on  all sides.    [Illustration: 033.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN ZAMUA]    One expedition led him to the mountain group of Nizir, at the end of the  chain known to the people of Lullume as the Kinipa.* He there reduced to  ruins seven towns whose inhabitants had barricaded themselves in urgent  haste, collected the few herds of cattle he could find, and driving  them back to the camp, set out afresh towards a part of Nizir as yet  unsubdued by any conqueror. The stronghold of Larbusa fell before the  battering-ram, to be followed shortly by the capture of Bara. Thereupon  the chiefs of Zamua, convinced of their helplessness, purchased the  king's departure by presents of horses, gold, silver, and corn.**  Nurramman alone remained impregnable in his retreat at Nishpi, and an  attempt to oust him resulted solely in the surrender of the fortress  of Birutu.*** The campaign, far from having been decisive, had to be  continued during the winter in another direction where revolts had taken  place,--in Khudun, in Kissirtu, and in the fief of Arashtua,**** all  three of which extended over the upper valleys of the lesser Zab, the  Radanu, the Turnat, and their affluents.         * Mount Kinipa is a part of Nizir, the Khalkhalan-dagh, if       we may-judge from the direction of the Assyrian campaign.         ** None of these places can be identified with certainty.       The gist of the account leads us to gather that Bara was       situated to the east of Dagara, and formed its frontier; we       shall not be far wrong in looking for all these districts in       the fastnesses of the Kara-dagh, in the caza of       Suleimaniyeh. Mount Nishpi is perhaps the Segirmc-dagh of       the present day.         *** The Assyrian compiler appears to have made use of two       slightly differing accounts of this campaign; he has twice       repeated the same facts without noticing his mistake.         **** The fief of Arashtua, situated beyond the Turnat, is       probably the district of Suleimaniyeh; it is, indeed, at       this place only that the upper course of the Turnat is       sufficiently near to that of the Radanu to make the marches       of Assur-nazir-pal in the direction indicated by the       Assyrian scribe possible. According to the account of the       _Annals_, it seems to me that we must seek for Khudun and       Kissirtu to the south of the fief of Arashtua, in the modern       cazas of Gulanbar or Shehrizor.    The king once more set out from Kakzi, crossed the Zab and the Eadanu,  through the gorges of Babiti, and halting on the ridges of Mount Simaki,  peremptorily demanded tribute from Dagara.* This was, however, merely  a ruse to deceive the enemy, for taking one evening the lightest of his  chariots and the best of his horsemen, he galloped all night without  drawing rein, crossed the Turnat at dawn, and pushing straight forward,  arrived in the afternoon of the same day before the walls of Ammali, in  the very heart of the fief of Arashtua.** The town vainly attempted a  defence; the whole population was reduced to slavery or dispersed in the  forests, the ramparts were demolished, and the houses reduced to  ashes. Khudun with twenty, and Kissirtu with ten of its villages, Bara,  Kirtiara, Dur-Lullume, and Bunisa, offered no further resistance, and  the invading host halted within sight of the defiles of Khashmar.***         * The _Annals of Assur-nazir-pal_ go on to mention that       Mount Simaki extended as far as the Turnat, and that it was       close to Mount Azira. This passage, when compared with that       in which the opening of the campaign is described, obliges       us to recognise in Mounts Simaki and Azira two parts of the       Shehrizor chain, parallel to the Seguirme-dagh. The fortress       of Mizu, mentioned in the first of these two texts, may       perhaps be the present Guran-kaleh.         ** Hommel thinks that Ammali is perhaps the present       Suleimaniyeh; it is, at all events, on this side that we       must look for its site.         *** I do not know whether we may trace the name of the       ancient Mount Khashmar-Khashmir in the present Azmir-dagh;       it is at its feet, probably in the valley of Suleimanabad,       that we ought to place the passes of Khashmar.    One kinglet, however, Amika of Zamru, showed no intention of  capitulating. Entrenched behind a screen of forests and frowning  mountain ridges, he fearlessly awaited the attack. The only access to  the remote villages over which he ruled, was by a few rough roads hemmed  in between steep cliffs and beds of torrents; difficult and dangerous  at ordinary times, they were blocked in war by temporary barricades, and  dominated at every turn by some fortress perched at a dizzy height above  them. After his return to the camp, where his soldiers were allowed  a short respite, Assur-nazir-pal set out against Zamru, though he was  careful not to approach it directly and attack it at its most formidable  points. Between two peaks of the Lara and Bidirgi ranges he discovered a  path which had been deemed impracticable for horses, or even for heavily  armed men. By this route, the king, unsuspected by the enemy, made his  way through the mountains, and descended so unexpectedly upon Zamru,  that Amika had barely time to make his escape,"]]]
