When they are taken young they will  become tame like our hens. The flamingos I have already described at  large. They have also many other sort of fowls, namely pigeons and  turtledoves; miniotas, a sort of land-fowls as big as crows, of a grey  colour, and good food; crusias, another sort of grey-coloured fowl almost  as big as a crow, which are only seen in the night (probably a sort of  owls) and are said to be good for consumptive people but eaten by none  else. Rabeks, a sort of large grey eatable fowls with long necks and  legs, not unlike herons; and many kinds of small birds.    Of land animals here are goats, as I said formerly, and asses good store.  When I was here before they were said to have had a great many bulls and  cows: but the pirates who have since miserably infested all these islands  have much lessened the number of those; not having spared the inhabitants  themselves: for at my being there this time the governor of Mayo was but  newly returned from being a prisoner among them, they having taken him  away, and carried him about with them for a year or two.    The sea is plentifully stocked with fish of divers sorts, namely  dolphins, bonetas, mullet, snapper, silver-fish, garfish, etc. And here  is a good bay to haul a seine or net in. I hauled mine several times, and  to good purpose; dragging ashore at one time 6 dozen of great fish, most  of them large mullet of a foot and a half or two foot long. Here are also  porpoises, and a small sort of whales that commonly visit this road every  day. I have already said that the months of May, June, July and August  (that is, the wet season) are the time when the green-turtle come hither  and go ashore to lay their eggs. I look upon it as a thing worth taking  notice of that the turtle should always, both in north and south  latitude, lay their eggs in the wet months. It might be thought,  considering what great rains there are then in some places where these  creatures lay, that their eggs should be spoiled by them. But the rain,  though violent, is soon soaked up by the sand wherein the eggs are  buried; and perhaps sinks not so deep into it as the eggs are laid: and  keeping down the heat may make the sand hotter below than it was before,  like a hot-bed. Whatever the reason may be why Providence determines  these creatures to this season of laying their eggs, rather than the dry,  in fact it is so, as I have constantly observed; and that not only with  the sea-turtle but with all other sorts of amphibious animals that lay  eggs; as crocodiles, alligators, iguanas etc. The inhabitants of this  island, even their governor and padres, are all negroes, wool-pated like  their African neighbours; from whom it is like they are descended;  though, being subjects to the Portuguese, they have their religion and  language. They are stout, lusty, well-limbed people, both men and women,  fat and fleshy; and they and their children as round and plump as little  porpoises; though the island appears so barren to a stranger as scarce to  have food for its inhabitants. I enquired how many people there might be  on the isle; and was told by one of the padres that here were 230 souls  in all. The negro governor has his patent from the Portuguese governor of  St. Jago. He is a very civil and sensible poor man; and they are  generally a good sort of people. He expects a small present from every  commander that lades salt here; and is glad to be invited aboard their  ships. He spends most of his time with the English in the salting season,  which is his harvest; and indeed, all the islanders are then fully  employed in getting somewhat; for they have no vessels of their own to  trade with, nor do any Portuguese vessels come hither: scarce any but  English, on whom they depend for trade: and though subjects of Portugal,  have a particular value for us. We don't pay them for their salt, but for  the labour of themselves and their beasts in lading it: for which we give  them victuals, some money, and old clothes, namely hats, shirts, and  other clothes: by which means many of them are indifferently well rigged;  but some of them go almost naked. When the turtle season comes in they  watch the sandy bays in the night to turn them; and having small huts at  particular places on the bays to keep them from the rain, and to sleep  in: and this is another harvest they have for food; for by report there  come a great many turtle to this and the rest of the Cape Verde Islands.  When the turtle season is over they have little to do but to hunt for  guinea-hens and manage their small plantations. But by these means they  have all the year some employment or other; whereby they get a  subsistence though but little else. When any of them are desirous to go  over to St. Jago they get a licence from the governor and desire passage  in any English ship that is going thither: and indeed all ships that lade  salt here will be obliged to touch at St. Jago for water, for here at the  bay is none, not so much as for drinking. It is true there is a small  well of brackish water not half a mile from the landing-place which the  asses that carry salt drink at; but it is very bad water. Asses  themselves are a commodity in some of these islands, several of our ships  coming hither purposely to freight with them and carry them to Barbados  and our other plantations. I stayed at Mayo 6 days and got 7 or 8 ton of  salt aboard for my voyage: in which time there came also into this road  several sail of merchants ships for salt; all bound with it for  Newfoundland.    THE AUTHOR'S ARRIVAL AT ST. JAGO; PRAYA AND ST. JAGO TOWN.    The 19th day of February, at about one o'clock in the morning, I weighed  from Mayo Road in order to water at St. Jago, which was about 5 or 6  leagues to the westward. We coasted along the island St. Jago and passed  by the port on the east of it I mentioned formerly which they call Praya;  where some English outward-bound East-Indiamen still touch, but not so  many of them as heretofore. We saw the fort upon the hill, the houses and  coconut-trees: but I would not go in to anchor here because I expected  better water on the south-west of the island at St. Jago Town. By eight  o'clock in the morning we saw the ships in that road, being within 3  leagues of it: but were forced to keep turning many hours to get in, the  flaws of wind coming so uncertain; as they do especially to the leeward  of islands that are high land. At length two Portuguese boats came off to  help tow us in; and about three o'clock in the afternoon we came to an  anchor and took the prospect of the town. We found here, besides two  Portuguese ships bound for Brazil whose boats had towed us in, an English  pink that had taken in asses at one of the Cape Verde Islands and was  bound to Barbados with them. Next morning I went ashore with my officers  to the governor, who treated us with sweetmeats: I told him the occasion  of my coming was chiefly for water; and that I desired also to take in  some refreshments of fowls, etc. He said I was welcome, and that he would  order the townsmen to bring their commodities to a certain house, where I  might purchase what I had occasion for: I told him I had not money but  would exchange some of the salt which I brought from Mayo for their  commodities. He replied that salt was indeed an acceptable commodity with  the poor people, but that if I designed to buy any cattle I must give  money for them. I contented myself with taking in dunghill-fowls: the  governor ordering a crier to go about the town and give notice to the  people that they might repair to such a place with fowls and maize for  feeding them where they might get salt in exchange for them: so I sent on  board for salt and ordered some of my men to truck the same for the fowls  and maize while the rest of them were busy in filling of water. This is  the effect of their keeping no boats of their own on the several islands,  that they are glad to by even their own salt of foreigners for want of  being able to transport it themselves from island to island.    St. Jago Town lies on the south-west part of the island in latitude about  15 degrees north, and is the seat of the general governor and of the  bishop of all the Cape Verde Islands. This town stands scattering against  the sides of two mountains, between which there is a deep valley, which  is about 200 yards wide against the sea; but within a quarter of a mile  it closes up so as not to be 40 yards wide. In the valley by the sea  there is a straggling street, houses on each side, and a run of water in  the bottom which empties itself into a fine small cove or sandy bay where  the sea is commonly very smooth; so that here is good watering and good  landing at any time; though the road be rocky and bad for ships. Just by  the landing-place there is a small fort, almost level with the sea, where  is always a court of guard kept. On the top of the hill, above the town,  there is another fort which, by the wall that is to be seen from the  road, seems to be a large place. They have cannon mounted there, but how  many know not: neither what use that fort can be of except it be for  salutes. The town may consist of 2 or 300 houses, all built of rough  stone; having also one convent, and one church.    OF THE INHABITANTS AND THEIR COMMODITIES.    The people in general are black, or at least of a mixed colour, except  only some few of the better sort, namely the governor, the bishop, some  gentlemen, and some of the padres; for some of these also are black. The  people about Praya are thievish; but these of St. Jago Town, living under  their governor's eye, are more orderly, though generally poor, having  little trade: yet besides chance ships of other nations there come hither  a Portuguese ship or two every year, in their way to Brazil.

Hereupon, all the old silver in the colony was handed over to Captain John  Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I suppose, and silver  buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons of worn-out coats, and  silver hilts of swords that had figured at court, all such curious old  articles were doubtless thrown into the melting-pot together. But by far  the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines of  South America, which the English buccaniers--(who were little better than  pirates)--had taken from the Spaniards, and brought to Massachusetts.    All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the result was  an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Each  had the date, 1652, on the one side, and the figure of a pine-tree on the  other. Hence they were called pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty  shillings that he coined, you will remember, Captain John Hull was  entitled to put one shilling into his own pocket.    The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master would have the  best of the bargain. They offered him a large sum of money, if he would  but give up that twentieth shilling, which he was continually dropping  into his own pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied  with the shilling. And well he might be; for so diligently did he labor,  that, in a few years, his pockets, his money bags, and his strong box,  were overflowing with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case when  he came into possession of Grandfather's chair; and, as he had worked so  hard at the mint, it was certainly proper that he should have a  comfortable chair to rest himself in.    When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, Samuel Sewell by  name, came a courting to his only daughter. His daughter,--whose name I do  not know, but we will call her Betsey,--was a fine hearty damsel, by no  means so slender as some young ladies of our own days. On the contrary,  having always fed heartily on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings,  and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as a pudding  herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey, did Samuel Sewell fall in  love. As he was a young man of good character, industrious in his  business, and a member of the church, the mint-master very readily gave  his consent.    \"Yes--you may take her,\" said he, in his rough way; \"and you'll find her a  heavy burden enough!\"    On the wedding day, we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself  in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree  shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat were sixpences; and the knees of  his smallclothes were buttoned with silver threepences. Thus attired, he  sat with great dignity in Grandfather's chair; and, being a portly old  gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite  side of the room, between her bride-maids, sat Miss Betsey. She was  blushing with all her might, and looked like a full blown paeony, or a  great red apple.    There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat, and gold  lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan laws and customs  would allow him to put on. His hair was cropped close to his head, because  Governor Endicott had forbidden any man to wear it below the ears. But he  was a very personable young man; and so thought the bride-maids and Miss  Betsey herself.    The mint-master also was pleased with his new son-in-law; especially as he  had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and had said nothing at all  about her portion. So when the marriage ceremony was over, Captain Hull  whispered a word to two of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and  soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as  wholesale merchants use, for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky  commodity was now to be weighed in them.    \"Daughter Betsey,\" said the mint-master, \"get into one side of these  scales.\"    Miss Betsey,--or Mrs. Sewell, as we must now call her,--did as she was bid,  like a dutiful child, without any question of the why and wherefore. But  what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay for her by the  pound, (in which case she would have been a dear bargain,) she had not the  least idea.    \"And now,\" said honest John Hull to the servants, \"bring that box hither.\"    The box, to which the mint-master pointed, was a huge, square, iron bound,  oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all four of you to play  at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged with might and main, but could  not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it  across the floor. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked  the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim  of bright pine-tree shillings, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewell  began to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money  in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master's honest  share of the coinage.    Then the servants, at Captain Hull's command, heaped double handfulls of  shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsey remained in the other.  Jingle, jingle, went the shillings, as handful after handful was thrown  in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young  lady from the floor.    \"There, son Sewell!\" cried the honest mint-master, resuming his seat in  Grandfather's chair. \"Take these shillings for my daughter's portion. Use  her kindly, and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that's worth  her weight in silver!\"        The children laughed heartily at this legend, and would hardly be  convinced but that Grandfather had made it out of his own head. He assured  them faithfully, however, that he had found it in the pages of a grave  historian, and had merely tried to tell it in a somewhat funnier style. As  for Samuel Sewell, he afterwards became Chief Justice of Massachusetts.    \"Well, Grandfather,\" remarked Clara, \"if wedding portions now-a-days were  paid as Miss Betsey's was, young ladies would not pride themselves upon an  airy figure as many of them do.\"          Chapter VII      When his little audience next assembled round the chair, Grandfather gave  them a doleful history of the Quaker persecution, which began in 1656, and  raged for about three years in Massachusetts.    He told them how, in the first place, twelve of the converts of George  Fox, the first Quaker in the world, had come over from England. They  seemed to be impelled by an earnest love for the souls of men, and a pure  desire to make known what they considered a revelation from Heaven. But  the rulers looked upon them as plotting the downfall of all government and  religion. They were banished from the colony. In a little while, however,  not only the first twelve had returned, but a multitude of other Quakers  had come to rebuke the rulers, and to preach against the priests and  steeple-houses.    Grandfather described the hatred and scorn with which these enthusiasts  were received. They were thrown into dungeons; they were beaten with many  stripes, women as well as men; they were driven forth into the wilderness,  and left to the tender mercies of wild beasts and Indians. The children  were amazed to hear, that, the more the Quakers were scourged, and  imprisoned, and banished, the more did the sect increase, both by the  influx of strangers, and by converts from among the Puritans. But  Grandfather told them, that God had put something into the soul of man,  which always turned the cruelties of the persecutor to nought.    He went on to relate, that, in 1659, two Quakers, named William Robinson  and Marmaduke Stephenson, were hanged at Boston. A woman had been  sentenced to die with them, but was reprieved, on condition of her leaving  the colony. Her name was Mary Dyer. In the year 1660 she returned to  Boston, although she knew death awaited her there; and, if Grandfather had  been correctly informed, an incident had then taken place, which connects  her with our story. This Mary Dyer had entered the mint-master's dwelling,  clothed in sackcloth and ashes, and seated herself in our great chair,  with a sort of dignity and state. Then she proceeded to deliver what she  called a message from Heaven; but in the midst of it, they dragged her to  prison.    \"And was she executed?\" asked Laurence.    \"She was,\" said Grandfather.    \"Grandfather,\" cried Charley, clenching his fist, \"I would have fought for  that poor Quaker woman!\"    \"Ah! but if a sword had been drawn for her,\" said Laurence, \"it would have  taken away all the beauty of her death.\"    It seemed as if hardly any of the preceding stories had thrown such an  interest around Grandfather's chair, as did the fact, that the poor,  persecuted, wandering Quaker woman had rested in it for a moment. The  children were so much excited, that Grandfather found it necessary to  bring his account of the persecution to a close.    \"In 1660, the same year in which Mary Dyer was executed,\" said he,  \"Charles the Second was restored to the throne of his fathers. This king  had many vices; but he would not permit blood to be shed, under pretence  of religion, in any part of his dominions. The Quakers in England told him  what had been done to their brethren in Massachusetts; and he sent orders  to Governor Endicott to forbear all such proceedings in future. And so  ended the Quaker persecution,--one of the most mournful passages in the  history of our forefathers.\"    Grandfather then told his auditors, that, shortly after the above  incident, the great chair had been given by the mint-master to the Rev.  Mr. John Eliot. He was the first minister of Roxbury. But besides  attending to his pastoral duties there,"]]]
