By a new ukase issued in 1830 the Jews were  expelled from the villages and hamlets of the government of Kiev. Thus  were human beings hurled about from village to town, from city to city,  from province to province, with no more concern than might be displayed  in the transportation of cattle.    This process of \"mobilization\" had reached its climax when the Polish  insurrection of 1830-1831 broke out, affecting the whole Western  region. [1] Fearing lest the persecuted Jews might be driven into the  arms of the Poles, the Government decided on a strategic retreat. In  February, 1831, in consequence of the representations of the local  military commander, who urged the Government \"to take into consideration  the present political circumstances, in which they (the Jews) may  occasionally prove useful,\" the final expulsion of the Jews from Kiev  was postponed for three years. At the end of the three years, the  governor of Kiev made similar representations to St. Petersburg,  emphasizing the desirability of allowing the Jews to remain in the city,  even though it might become necessary to segregate them in a special  quarter, \"this (i.e., their remaining in the city) being found useful  also in this respect that, on account of their temperate and simple  habits of life, they are in a position to sell their goods considerably  cheaper, whereas in the case of their expulsion many articles and  manufactures will rise in price.\" Nicholas I. rejected this plea, and  only agreed to postpone the expulsion until February, 1835, for the  reason that the new \"Statute Concerning the Jews,\" then in preparation,  which was to define the general legal status of Russian Jewry, was  expected to be ready by that time. Similar short reprieves were granted  to the Jews about to be exiled from Nicholayev, from the villages of the  government of Kiev, and from other places.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 16, n. 1.]      5. THE CODIFICATION OF JEWISH DISABILITIES    No sooner had the conscription ukase been issued than the bureaucrats of  St. Petersburg began to apply themselves in the hidden recesses of their  chancelleries to a new civil code for the Jews, which was to supersede  the antiquated Statute of 1804. The work passed through a number of  departments. The projected enactment was framed by the \"Jewish  Committee,\" which had been established in 1823 for the purpose of  bringing about \"a reduction of the number of Jews in the monarchy,\" and  consisted of cabinet ministers and the chiefs of departments. [1]  Originally the department chiefs had elaborated a draft covering 1230  clauses, a gigantic code of disabilities; evidently founded on the  principle that in the case of Jews everything is forbidden which, is not  permitted by special legislation. The dimensions of the draft were such  that even the Government was appalled and decided to turn it over to the  ministerial members of the Committee.    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 407 et seq.]    Modified in shape and reduced in size, the code was submitted in 1834 to  the Department of Laws forming part of the Council of State, and after  careful discussion by the Department of Laws was brought up at the  plenary sessions of the Council. The \"ministerial\" draft, though smaller  in bulk, was marked by such severity that the Department of Laws found  it necessary to tone it down. The ministers, with the exception of the  Minister of Finance, had proposed to transfer all Jews, within a period  of three years, from the villages to the towns and townlets. The  Department of Laws considered this measure too risky, pointing to the  White Russian expulsion of 1823, which had failed to produce the  expected results, and, \"while it has ruined the Jews, it does not in the  least seem to have improved the condition of the villagers.\" [1] The  plenum of the Council agreed with the Department of Laws that \"the  proposed expulsion of the Jews (from the villages), being extremely  difficult of execution and being of problematic benefit, should be  eliminated from the Statute and should be stopped even there where it  had been decreed but not carried into effect.\"    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 407.]    The report was laid before the Tzar, who attached to it the following  \"resolution\": [1] \"Where this measure (of expulsion) has been started, it  is inconvenient to repeal it; but it shall be postponed for the time  being in the governments in which no steps towards it have as yet been  made.\" For a number of years this \"resolution\" hung like the sword of  Damocles over the heads of rural Jewry.    [Footnote 1: See on the meaning of the term \"resolution\" Vol. I, p. 253,  n. 1.]    Less yielding was the Tzar's attitude on the question of the partial  enlargement of the Pale of Settlement. The Department of Laws had  suggested to grant the merchants of the first guild the right of  residence in the Russian interior in the interest of the exchequer and  big business. At the general meeting of the Council of State only a  minority (thirteen) voted for the proposal. The majority (twenty-two)  argued that they had no right to violate the time-honored tradition,  \"dating from the time of Peter the Great,\" which bars the Jews from the  Russian interior; that to admit them \"would produce a very unpleasant  impression upon our people, which, on account of its religious notions  and its general estimate of the moral peculiarities of the Jews, has  become accustomed to keep aloof from them and to despise them;\" that the  countries of Western Europe, which had accorded fall citizenship to the  Jews, \"cannot serve as an example for Russia, partly because of the  incomparably larger number of Jews living here, partly because our  Government and people, with all their well-known tolerance, are yet far  from that indifference with which certain other nations look upon  religious matters.\" After marking his approval of the last words by the  marginal exclamation \"Thank God!\", the Tzar disposed of the whole matter  in the following brief resolution: \"This question has been determined by  Peter the Great. I dare not change it; I completely share the opinion of  the twenty-two members.\"    While on this occasion the Tzar endorsed the opinion of the Council as  represented by its majority, in cases in which it proved favorable to  the Jews he did not hesitate to set it aside. Thus the Department of  Laws, as part of the Council of State, and, following in its wake, the  Council itself had timidly suggested to Nicholas to comply in part with  the plea of the Jews for a mitigation of the rigors of conscription, [1]  but the imperial verdict read: \"To be left as heretofore.\" Nicholas  remained equally firm on the question of the expulsions from Kiev. The  Department of Laws, guided by the previously-mentioned representations  of the local governor, favored the postponement of the expulsion, and  fourteen members of the plenary Council agreed with the suggestion of  the Department, and resolved to recommend it to the \"benevolent  consideration of his Majesty,\" in other words to request the Tzar to  revoke the baneful ukase. But fifteen, members rejected all such  propositions on the ground that, as far as that question was concerned,  the imperial will was unmistakable, the Tzar having decided the matter  in a sense unfavorable to the Jews. In a similar manner, numerous other  decisions of the Council of State were dictated not so much by inner  conviction as by fear of the clearly manifested imperial will, which no  one dared to cross.    [Footnote 1: The Kahal of Vilna, in a memorandum submitted in 1835,  pleaded for the abolition of the dreadful institution of cantonists, and  begged that the age limit of Jewish recruits be raised from 12-15 to  20-35.]    Under these circumstances, the entire draft of the statute passed  through the Council of State. In its session of March 28, 1835, the  Council voted to submit it to the emperor for his signature. On this  occasion a solitary and belated voice was raised in defence of the Jews,  without evoking an echo. A member of the Council, Admiral Greig, who was  brave enough to swim against the current, submitted a \"special opinion\"  on the proposed statute, in which he advocated a number of alleviations  in the intolerable legal status of the Jews. Greig put the whole issue  in a nut-shell: \"Are the Jews to be suffered in the country, or not?\"  If they are, then we must abandon the system \"of hampering them in their  actions and in their religious customs\" and grant them at least \"equal  liberty of commerce with the others,\" for in this case \"we may  anticipate more good from their gratitude than from their hatred.\"  Should, however, the conclusion be reached that the Jews ought not to be  tolerated in Russia, then the only thing to be done is \"to banish them  all without exception from the country into foreign lands.\" This might  be \"more useful than to allow this estate to remain in the country and  to keep it in a position which is bound to arouse in them continual  dissatisfaction and resentment.\" It need scarcely be added that the  voice of the \"queer\" admiral found no hearing.    Nor did the Jewish people manage to get a hearing. Stunned by the  uninterrupted succession of blows and moved by the spirit of martyrdom,  Russian Jewry kept its peace during those dismal years. Yet, when the  news of an impending general regulation of the Jewish legal status began  to leak out, a section of Russian Jewry became astir. For to anticipate  a blow is more excruciating than to receive one, and it was quite  natural that an attempt should be made to stay the hand which was lifted  to strike. Towards the end of 1833 the Council of State received, as  part of the material bearing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#6)"],[1,"themselves from being trampled to death.    Truly the Panther had spent well the few minutes allotted to him. He  fired new shots, some into the frightened herd. His tremendous voice  never ceased for an instant to encourage his charging troops, and to  roar out threats against the enemy. Urrea, to his credit, made an  attempt to organize his men, to stop the panic, and to see the nature of  the enemy, but he was borne away in the frantic mob of men and horses  which was now rushing for the open plain.    Ned and Obed led the fugitives to the place where the rifles and muskets  were stacked. Here they rapidly distributed the weapons and then broke  across the tree trunks all they could not use or carry. Another minute  and they reached their horses, where the Panther, panting from his huge  exertions, joined them. Ned helped the lame man upon one of the horses,  the weakest two who remained, including the boy, were put upon the  others, and led by the Panther they started northward, leaving the  chaparral.    It was a singular march, but for a long time nothing was said. The sound  of the Mexican stampede could yet be heard, moving to the south, but  they, rescuers and rescued, walked in silence save for the sound of  their feet in the mud of the wind-swept plain. Ned looked curiously at  the faces of those whom they had saved, but the night had not lightened,  and he could discern nothing. They went thus a full quarter of an hour.  The noise of the stampede sank away in the south, and then the Panther  laughed.    It was a deep, hearty, unctuous laugh that came from the very depths of  the man's chest. It was a laugh with no trace of merely superficial joy.  He who uttered it laughed because his heart and soul were in it. It was  a laugh of mirth, relief and triumph, all carried to the highest degree.  It was a long laugh, rising and falling, but when it ceased and the  Panther had drawn a deep breath he opened his mouth again and spoke the  words that were in his mind.    \"I shorely did some rippin' an' roarin' then,\" he said. \"It was the best  chance I ever had, an' I guess I used it. How things did work for us!  Them sleepy sentinels, an' then the stampede of the animals, carryin'  Urrea an' the rest right away with it.\"    \"Fortune certainly worked for us,\" said Ned.    \"And we can find no words in which to describe to you our gratitude,\"  said the crippled man on the horse. \"We were informed very clearly by  Urrea that we were rebels and, under the decree of Santa Anna, would be  executed. Even our young friend here, this boy, William Allen, would not  have been spared.\"    \"We ain't all the way out of the woods yet,\" said the Panther, not  wishing to have their hopes rise too high and then fall. \"Of course  Urrea an' his men have some arms left. They wouldn't stack 'em all under  the shed, an' they can get more from other Mexicans in these parts. When  they learn from their trailers how few we are they'll follow.\"    The rescued were silent, save one, evidently a veteran frontiersman, who  said:    \"Let 'em come. I was took by surprise, not thinkin' any Mexicans was  north of the Rio Grande. But now that I've got a rifle on one shoulder  an' a musket on the other I think I could thrash an acre-lot full of  'em.\"    \"That's the talk,\" said Obed White. \"We'll say to 'em: 'Come one, come  all, this rock from its firm base may fly, but we're the boys who'll  never say die.'\"    They relapsed once more into silence. The rain had lightened a little,  but the night was as dark as ever. The boy whom the man had called  William Allen drew up by the side of Ned. They were of about the same  height, and each was as tall and strong as a man.    \"Have you any friends here with you?\" asked Ned.    \"All of them are my friends, but I made them in captivity. I came to  Texas to find my fortune, and I found this.\"    The boy laughed, half in pity of himself, and half with genuine humor.    \"But I ought not to complain,\" he added, \"when we've been saved in the  most wonderful way. How did you ever happen to do it?\"    \"We've been following you all the way from the other side of the Rio  Grande, waiting a good chance. It came to-night with the darkness, the  rain, and the carelessness of the Mexicans. I heard the man call you  William Allen. My name is Fulton, Edward Fulton, Ned to my friends.\"    \"And mine's Will to my friends.\"    \"And you and I are going to be friends, that's sure.\"    \"Nothing can be surer.\"    The hands of the two boys met in a strong grasp, signifying a friendship  that was destined to endure.    The Panther and Obed now began to seek a place for a camp. They knew  that too much haste would mean a breakdown, and they meant that the  people whom they had rescued should have a rest. But it took a long time  to find the trees which would furnish wood and partial shelter. It was  Obed who made the happy discovery some time after midnight. Turning to  their left, they entered a grove of dwarf oaks, covering a half acre or  so, and with much labor and striving built a fire. They made it a big  fire, too, and fed it until the flames roared and danced. Ned noticed  that all the rescued prisoners crouched close to it, as if it were a  giver of strength and courage as well as warmth, and now the light  revealed their faces. He looked first at the crippled man, and the  surprise that he had felt at his first glimpse of him increased.    The stranger was of a type uncommon on the border. His large features  showed cultivation and the signs of habitual and deep thought. His thick  white hair surmounted a broad brow. His clothing, although torn by  thorns and briars, was of fine quality. Ned knew instinctively that it  was a powerful face, one that seldom showed the emotions behind it. The  rest, except the boy, were of the border, lean, sun-browned men,  dressed in tanned deerskin.    The Panther and Obed also gazed at the crippled man with great  curiosity. They knew the difference, and they were surprised to find  such a man in such a situation. He did not seem to notice them at first,  but from his seat on a log leaned over the fire warming his hands, which  Ned saw were large, white and smooth. His legs lay loosely against the  log, as if he were suffering from a species of paralysis. The others,  soaked by the rain, which, however, now ceased, were also hovering over  the fire which was giving new life to the blood in their veins. The man  with the white hands turned presently and, speaking to Ned, Obed and the  Panther, said:    \"My name is Roylston, John Roylston.\"    Ned started.    \"I see that you have heard of it,\" continued the stranger, but without  vanity. \"Yes, I am the merchant of New Orleans. I have lands and other  property in this region for which I have paid fairly. I hold the deeds  and they are also guaranteed to me by Santa Anna and the Mexican  Congress. I was seized by this guerilla leader, Urrea. He knew who I  was, and he sought to extract from me an order for a large sum of money  lying in a European bank in the City of Mexico. There are various ways  of procuring such orders, and he tried one of the most primitive  methods. That is why I cannot walk without help. No, I will not tell  what was done. It is not pleasant to hear. Let it pass. I shall walk  again as well as ever in a month.\"    \"Did he get the order?\" asked Obed curiously.    Roylston laughed deep in his throat.    \"He did not,\" he said. \"It was not because I valued it so much, but my  pride would not permit me to give way to such crude methods. I must  say, however, that you three came just in time, and you have done a most  marvelous piece of work.\"    Ned shuddered and walked a little space out on the plain to steady his  nerves. He had never deceived himself about the dangers that the Texans  were facing, but it seemed that they would have to fight every kind of  ferocity. When he returned, Obed and the Panther were building the fire  higher.    \"We must get everybody good and dry,\" said the Panther. \"Pursuit will  come, but not to-night, an' we needn't worry about the blaze. We've food  enough for all of you for a day, but we haven't the horses, an' for that  I'm sorry. If we had them we could git away without a doubt to the Texan  army.\"    \"But not having them,\" said Obed, \"we'll even do the best we can, if the  Mexicans, having run away, come back to fight another day.\"    \"So we will,\" said a stalwart Texan named Fields. \"That Urrea don't get  me again, and if I ain't mistook your friend here is Mr. Palmer, better  known in our parts as the Ring Tailed Panther, ain't he?\"    Ned saw the Panther's huge form swell. He still wore the great serape,  which shone in the firelight with a deep blood-red tinge.    \"I am the Ring Tailed Panther,\" he said proudly.    \"Then lemme shake your hand. You an' your pards have done a job to-night  that ain't had its like often, and me bein' one of them that's profited  by it makes it look all the bigger to me.\"    The Panther graciously extended an enormous palm, and the great palm of  Fields met it in a giant clasp. A smile lighted up the somber face of  Mr. Roylston as he looked at them.    \"Often we find powerful friends when we least expect them,\" he said.    \"As you are the worst hurt of the lot,\" said the Panther, \"we're going  to make you a bed right here by the fire. No, it ain't any use sayin'  you won't lay down on it. If you won't we'll jest have to put you down.\"    They spread a blanket, upon which the exhausted merchant lay, and they  covered him with a serape. Soon he fell asleep, and then Fields said to  Ned and his comrades:    \"You fellows have done all the work, an' you've piled up such a mountain  of debt against us that we can never wipe it out. Now you go to sleep  and four of us will watch. And, knowin' what would happen to us if we  were caught, we'll watch well. But nothing is to be expected to-night.\"    \"Suits us,\" said Obed. \"Some must watch while"]]]
