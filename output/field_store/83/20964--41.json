And so we ask for courage, strength, and pardon--  Especially, I think, we ask for pardon--    And that You'll stand beside us to the last.        _L.W. in London \"Spectator.\"_          We Are Seven                      --A simple Child,  That lightly draws its breath,  And feels its life in every limb,  What should it know of death?    I met a little cottage Girl:  She was eight years old, she said;  Her hair was thick with many a curl  That clustered round her head.    She had a rustic, woodland air,  And she was wildly clad:  Her eyes were fair, and very fair;  --Her beauty made me glad.    \"Sisters and brothers, little Maid,  How many may you be?\"  \"How many? Seven in all,\" she said,  And wondering looked at me.    \"And where are they? I pray you tell.\"  She answered, \"Seven are we;  And two of us at Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea.    \"Two of us in the church-yard lie,  My sister and my brother;  And, in the church-yard cottage, I  Dwell near them with my mother.\"    \"You say that two at Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea,  Yet ye are seven!--I pray you tell,  Sweet Maid, how this may be.\"    Then did the little Maid reply,  \"Seven boys and girls are we;  Two of us in the church-yard lie,  Beneath the church-yard tree.\"    \"You run about, my little Maid,  Your limbs they are alive;  If two are in the church-yard laid,  Then ye are only five.\"    \"Their graves are green, they may be seen,\"  The little Maid replied,  \"Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,  And they are side by side.    \"My stockings there I often knit,  My kerchief there I hem;  And there upon the ground I sit,  And sing a song to them.    \"And often after sunset, Sir,  When it is light and fair,  I take my little porringer,  And eat my supper there.    \"The first that died was sister Jane;  In bed she moaning lay,  Till God released her of her pain;  And then she went away.    \"So in the church-yard she was laid;  And, when the grass was dry,  Together round her grave we played,  My brother John and I.    \"And when the ground was white with snow,  And I could run and slide,  My brother John was forced to go,  And he lies by her side.\"    \"How many are you, then,\" said I,  \"If they two are in heaven?\"  Quick was the little Maid's reply,  \"O Master! we are seven.\"    \"But they are dead; those two are dead!  Their spirits are in heaven!\"  'T was throwing words away; for still  The little Maid would have her will,  And said, \"Nay, we are seven!\"        _William Wordsworth._          Echo      \"I asked of Echo, t'other day    (Whose words are often few and funny),  What to a novice she could say    Of courtship, love and matrimony.    Quoth Echo plainly,--'Matter-o'-money!'    \"Whom should I marry? Should it be    A dashing damsel, gay and pert,  A pattern of inconstancy;    Or selfish, mercenary flirt?    Quoth Echo, sharply,--'Nary flirt!'    \"What if, aweary of the strife    That long has lured the dear deceiver,  She promise to amend her life,    And sin no more; can I believe her?    Quoth Echo, very promptly,--'Leave her!'    \"But if some maiden with a heart    On me should venture to bestow it,  Pray should I act the wiser part    To take the treasure or forego it?    Quoth Echo, with decision,--'Go it!'    \"But what if, seemingly afraid    To bind her fate in Hymen's fetter,  She vow she means to die a maid,    In answer to my loving letter?    Quoth Echo, rather coolly,-'Let her!'    \"What if, in spite of her disdain,    I find my heart entwined about  With Cupid's dear, delicious chain    So closely that I can't get out?    Quoth Echo, laughingly,--'Get out!'    \"But if some maid with beauty blest,    As pure and fair as Heaven can make her,  Will share my labor and my rest    Till envious Death shall overtake her?    Quoth Echo (sotto voce),--'Take her!'\"        _John G. Saxe._          Engineers Making Love      It's noon when Thirty-five is due,  An' she comes on time like a flash of light,  An' you hear her whistle \"Too-tee-too!\"  Long 'fore the pilot swings in sight.  Bill Madden's drivin' her in to-day,  An' he's calling his sweetheart far away--  Gertrude Hurd lives down by the mill;  You might see her blushin'; she knows it's Bill.  \"Tudie, tudie! Toot-ee! Tudie, tudie! Tu!\"    Six-five, A.M. there's a local comes,  Makes up at Bristol, runnin' east;  An' the way her whistle sings and hums  Is a livin' caution to man and beast.  Every one knows who Jack White calls,--  Little Lou Woodbury, down by the falls;  Summer or Winter, always the same,  She hears her lover callin' her name--  \"Lou-ie! Lou-ie! Lou-iee!\"    But at one fifty-one, old Sixty-four--  Boston express, runs east, clear through--  Drowns her rattle and rumble and roar  With the softest whistle that ever blew.  An' away on the furthest edge of town  Sweet Sue Winthrop's eyes of brown  Shine like the starlight, bright and clear,  When she hears the whistle of Abel Gear,  \"You-oo! Su-u-u-u-u-e!\"    Along at midnight a freight comes in,  Leaves Berlin sometime--I don't know when;  But it rumbles along with a fearful din  Till it reaches the Y-switch there and then  The clearest notes of the softest bell  That out of a brazen goblet fell  Wake Nellie Minton out of her dreams;  To her like a wedding-bell it seems--  \"Nell, Nell, Nell! Nell, Nell, Nell!\"    Tom Willson rides on the right-hand side,  Givin' her steam at every stride;  An' he touches the whistle, low an' clear,  For Lulu Gray on the hill, to hear--  \"Lu-Lu! Loo-Loo! Loo-oo!\"    So it goes all day an' all night  Till the old folks have voted the thing a bore;  Old maids and bachelors say it ain't right  For folks to do courtin' with such a roar.  But the engineers their kisses will blow  From a whistle valve to the girls they know,  An' stokers the name of their sweethearts tell;  With the \"Too-too-too\" and the swinging bell.          _R.J. Burdette._          Guilty or Not Guilty      She stood at the bar of justice,    A creature wan and wild,  In form too small for a woman,    In features too old for a child;  For a look so worn and pathetic    Was stamped on her pale young face,  It seemed long years of suffering    Must have left that silent trace.    \"Your name?\" said the judge, as he eyed her    With kindly look yet keen,--  \"Is Mary McGuire, if you please, sir.\"    And your age?\"--\"I am turned fifteen.\"  \"Well, Mary,\" and then from a paper    He slowly and gravely read,  \"You are charged here--I'm sorry to say it--    With stealing three loaves of bread.    \"You look not like an offender,    And I hope that you can show  The charge to be false. Now, tell me,    Are you guilty of this, or no?\"  A passionate burst of weeping    Was at first her sole reply.  But she dried her eyes in a moment,    And looked in the judge's eye.    \"I will tell you just how it was, sir:    My father and mother are dead,  And my little brothers and sisters    Were hungry and asked me for bread.  At first I earned it for them    By working hard all day,  But somehow, times were bad, sir,    And the work all fell away.    \"I could get no more employment.    The weather was bitter cold,  The young ones cried and shivered--    (Little Johnny's but four years old)--  So what was I to do, sir?    I am guilty, but do not condemn.  I _took_--oh, was it _stealing?_--    The bread to give to them.\"    Every man in the court-room--    Gray-beard and thoughtless youth--  Knew, as he looked upon her,    That the prisoner spake the truth;  Out from their pockets came kerchiefs,    Out from their eyes sprung tears,  And out from their old faded wallets    Treasures hoarded for years.    The judge's face was a study,    The strangest you ever saw,  As he cleared his throat and murmured    _Something_ about the _law_;  For one so learned in such matters,    So wise in dealing with men,  He seemed, on a simple question,    Sorely puzzled, just then.    But no one blamed him or wondered,    When at last these words he heard,  \"The sentence of this young prisoner    Is, for the present, deferred.\"  And no one blamed him or wondered    When he went to her and smiled  And tenderly led from the court-room,    Himself, the \"guilty\" child.          The Baby      Where did you come from, baby dear?  _Out of the everywhere into the here._    Where did you get your eyes so blue?  _Out of the sky as I came through._    What makes the light in them sparkle and spin?  _Some of the starry spikes left in._    Where did you get that little tear?  _I found it waiting when I got here._    What makes your forehead so smooth and high?  _A soft hand stroked it as I went by._    What makes your cheek like a warm white rose?  _Something better than anyone knows._    Whence that three-cornered smile of bliss?  _Three angels gave me at once a kiss._    Where did you get that pearly ear?  _God spoke, and it came out to hear._    Where did you get those arms and hands?  _Love made itself into hooks and bands._    Feet, whence did you come, you darling things?  _From the same box as the cherubs' wings._    How did they all just come to be you?  _God thought about me, and so I grew._    But how did you come to us, you dear?  _God thought of you, and so I am here._        _George Macdonald._          Song of the Sea      The sea! the sea! the open sea!  The blue, the fresh, the ever free!  Without a mark, without a bound,  It runneth the earth's wide regions round;  It plays with the clouds; it mocks the skies,  Or like a cradled creature lies.    I'm on the sea! I'm on the sea!  I am where I would ever be;  With the blue above and the blue below,  And silence wheresoe'er I go.  If a storm should come and awake the deep  What matter? _I_ shall ride and sleep.    I love, oh, how I love to ride  On the fierce, foaming, bursting tide,  When every mad wave drowns the moon,  Or whistles aloud his tempest tune,  And tells how goeth the world below,  And why the southwest blasts do blow.

There was also a huge  train of French wounded being dressed on the other side of the station,  including lots of weird, gaily-bedecked Zouaves.    There was no real confusion about the whole day, owing to the good  organising of the No.-- Clearing Hospital people who run it. Every man  was fed, and dressed and sorted. They'll have a heavy time at the two  hospitals to-night with the cases sent up from the trains.    M. and I are now--9 P.M.--in charge of a train of 141 (with an M.O. and  two orderlies) for St Nazaire; we jump out at the stations and see to  them, and the orderlies and the people on the stations feed them: we  have the worst cases next to us. We may get there some time to-morrow  morning, and when they are taken off, we train back, arriving probably  on Wednesday at Le Mans. The lot on this train are the best leavings of  to-day's trains,--a marvellously cheery lot, munching bread and jam and  their small share of hot tea, and blankets have just been issued. We  ourselves have a rug, and a ration of bread, tea, and jam; we had dinner  on the station.    When I think of your Red Cross practices on boy scouts, and the grim  reality, it makes one wonder. And the biggest wonder of it all is the  grit there is in them, and the price they are individually and  unquestioningly paying for doing their bit in this War.      _Monday, September 21st._--In train on way back to Le Mans from St  Nazaire. We did the journey in twelve hours, and arrived at 9 this  morning, which was very good, considering the congestion on the line. In  the middle of the night we pulled up alongside an immense troop train,  taking a whole Brigade of D. of Cornwall's L.I. up to the front, such a  contrast to our load coming away from the front. Our lot will be a long  time getting to bed; the Medical Officers at St N. told us there were  already two trains in, and no beds left on hospitals or ships, and 1300  more expected to-day; four died in one of the trains; ours were pretty  well, after the indescribable filth and fug of the train all night; it  was not an ambulance train, but trucks and ordinary carriages. The men  say there are hardly any officers left in many regiments. There has  never been this kind of rush to be coped with anywhere, but the Germans  must be having worse. We had thirteen German prisoners tacked on to us  with a guard of the London Scottish, the first Territorials to come out,  bursting with health and pride and keenness. They are not in the  fighting line yet, but are used as escorts for the G.P. among other  jobs. One of the men on our train had had his shoulder laid open for six  inches by a shell, where he couldn't see the wound. He asked me if it  was a bullet wound! He himself thought it was too large for that, and  might be shrapnel! He hadn't mentioned it all night.    We had some dressings to be done again this morning, and then left them  in charge of the M.O. and two orderlies, and went to report ourselves to  the A.D.M.S. and get a warrant for the return journey. We shall get in  to Le Mans somewhere about midnight. I'm not a bit tired, strange to  say; we got a few rests in the night, but couldn't sleep.      _Tuesday, September 22nd._--Got back to Le Mans at 2  A.M.--motor-ambulanced up to the hospital, where an orderly made lovely  beds for us on stretchers, with brown blankets and pillows, in the  theatre, and labelled the door \"Operation,\" in case any one should  disturb us. At 6 we went to our respective diggings for a wash and  breakfast, and reported to Matron at 8. We have been two days and two  nights in our clothes; food where, when, and what one could get; one  wash only on a station platform at a tap which a sergeant kindly pressed  for me while I washed! one cleaning of teeth in the dark on the line  between trucks. They have no water on trains or at stations, except on  the engine, which makes tea in cans for you for the men when it stops.    We are to rest to-day, to be ready for another train to-night if  necessary. The line from the front to Rouen--where there are two General  Hospitals--is cut; hence this appalling over-crowding at our base. When  we got back this morning, nine of those we took off the trains on Sunday  afternoon had died here, and one before he reached the hospital--three  of tetanus. I haven't heard how many at the other hospital at the Jesuit  school--tetanus there too. Some of the amputations die of septic  absorption and shock, and you wouldn't wonder if you saw them. I went to  the 9 o'clock Choral High Mass this morning at that glorious and  beautiful Cathedral--all gorgeous old glass and white and grey stone,  slender Gothic and fat Norman. It was very fine and comforting.    The sick officers are frightfully pleased to see 'The Times,' no matter  how old; so are we. I've asked M. to collect their 1/2d. picture daily  papers once a week for the men.      _Wednesday, September 23rd._--Have been helping in the wards at  No.-- to-day. The Sisters and orderlies there have all about twice what  they can get through--the big dressings are so appalling and new cases  have been coming in--all stretcher cases. As soon as they begin to  recover at all they are sent down to the base to make room for worse  ones off the trains. To-morrow I am on station duty again--possibly for  another train.    There is a rumour that three British cruisers have been sunk by a  submarine--it can't be true.    I don't see why this battle along the French frontier should ever come  to an end, at any rate till both armies are exhausted, and decide to go  to bed. The men say we can't spot their guns--they are too well hidden  in these concrete entrenchments.    The weather is absolutely glorious all day, and the stars all night.  Orion, with his shining bodyguard, from Sirius to Capella, is blazing  every morning at 4.      _Thursday, September 24th_, 3 P.M.--Taking 480 sick and wounded down to  St Nazaire, with a junior staff nurse, one M.O., and two orderlies. Just  been feeding them all at Angers; it is a stupendous business. The train  is miles long--not corridor or ambulance; they have straw to lie on the  floors and stretchers. The M.O. has been two nights in the train already  on his way down from the front (four miles from the guns), and we joined  on to him with a lot of hospital cases sent down to the base. I've been  collecting the worst ones into carriages near ours all the way down  when we stop; but of course you miss a good many. Got my haversack lined  with jaconet and filled with cut-dressings, very convenient, as you have  both hands free. We continually stop at little stations, so you can get  to a good many of them, and we get quite expert at clawing along the  footboards; some of the men, with their eyes, noses, or jaws shattered,  are so extraordinarily good and uncomplaining. Got hold of a  spout-feeder and some tubing at Angers for a boy in the Grenadier  Guards, with a gaping hole through his mouth to his chin, who can't eat,  and cannot otherwise drink. The French people bring coffee, fruit, and  all sorts of things to them when we stop.    We shall have to wait at St Nazaire all day, and come back by night  to-morrow.    One swanky Ambulance Train carries four permanent Sisters to the front  to fetch cases to Le Mans and the Base. They go to Villeneuve. They say  the country is deserted, crops left to waste, houses empty, and when you  get there no one smiles or speaks, but listens to the guns. The men seem  to think the Germans have got our range, but we haven't found theirs.  The number of casualties must be nearly into five figures this last  battle alone; and when you think of the Russians, the Germans, the  French, the Austrians, and the Belgians all like that, the whole  convulsion seems more meaningless than ever for civilised nations.    This is in scraps, owing to the calls of duty. The beggars simply swarm  out of the train at every stop--if they can limp or pull up by one  arm--to get the fruit and things from the French.      _Friday, September 25th._--In train back to Le Mans, 9 P.M. We landed  our tired, stiff, painful convoy at St Nazaire at 8.45 yesterday  evening. The M.O.'s there told us our lot made 1800 that had come down  since early morning; one load of bad cases took eight hours to unload.  The officers all seemed depressed and overworked, and they were having a  very tight fit to get beds for them at the various hospitals at St  Nazaire. At about 10 P.M. the last were taken off by the motor  ambulances, and we got some dinner on the station with our Civil  Surgeon, who was looking forward to a night in a tent out of a train.    The R.T.O. found us an empty 1st class carriage in the station to sleep  in, and the sergeant found us a candle and matches and put us to bed,  after a sketchy wash provided by the buffet lady.    The din was continuous all night, so one didn't sleep much, but had a  decent rest (and a flea). The sergeant called us at 6.30, and we had  another sketchy wash, and coffee and rolls and jam at the buffet. Then  we found our way to the hospital ship _Carisbrook Castle_. The Army  Sister in charge was most awfully kind, showed us over, made the steward  turn on hot baths for us, provided notepaper, kept us to lunch--the  nicest meal we've seen for weeks! The ship had 500 cases on board, and  was taking 200 more--many wounded officers.    A captain of the ---- told me all his adventures from the moment he was  hit till now. His regiment had nine officers killed and twenty-seven  wounded. He said they knew things weren't going well in that retreat,  but they never knew how critical it was at the time.    After lunch, we took our grateful leave and went to the A.D.M.S.'s  office for our return warrants for the R.T.O. (I have just had to sign  it for fourteen, as senior officer of our two selves and twelve A.S.C.  men taking two trucks of stores, who have no officer with"]]]
