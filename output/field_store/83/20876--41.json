If he could but come now and stand at the entering  in of the gate, with helmet and shield and lances twain, as  mighty a man as when first I marked him in our house  drinking and making merry what time he came up out of  Ephyra from Ilus son of Mermerus! For even thither had  Odysseus gone on his swift ship to seek a deadly drug, that  he might have wherewithal to smear his bronze-shod arrows:  but Ilus would in nowise give it to him, for he had in awe  the everliving gods. But my father gave it him, for he bare  him wondrous love. O that Odysseus might in such strength  consort with the wooers: so should they all have swift fate  and bitter wedlock! Howbeit these things surely lie on the  knees of the gods, whether he shall return or not, and take  vengeance in his halls. But I charge thee to take counsel  how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall. Come  now, mark and take heed unto my words. On the morrow call  the Achaean lords to the assembly, and declare thy saying  to all, and take the gods to witness. As for the wooers bid  them scatter them each one to his own, and for thy mother,  if her heart is moved to marriage, let her go back to the  hall of that mighty man her father, and her kinsfolk will  furnish a wedding feast, and array the gifts of wooing  exceeding many, all that should go back with a daughter  dearly beloved. And to thyself I will give a word of wise  counsel, if perchance thou wilt hearken. Fit out a ship,  the best thou hast, with twenty oarsmen, and go to inquire  concerning thy father that is long afar, if perchance any  man shall tell thee aught, or if thou mayest hear the voice  from Zeus, which chiefly brings tidings to men. Get thee  first to Pylos and inquire of goodly Nestor, and from  thence to Sparta to Menelaus of the fair hair, for he came  home the last of the mail-coated Achaeans. If thou shalt  hear news of the life and the returning of thy father, then  verily thou mayest endure the wasting for yet a year. But  if thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone, return then to  thine own dear country and pile his mound, and over it pay  burial rites, full many as is due, and give thy mother to a  husband. But when thou hast done this and made an end,  thereafter take counsel in thy mind and heart, how thou  mayest slay the wooers in thy halls, whether by guile or  openly; for thou shouldest not carry childish thoughts,  being no longer of years thereto. Or hast thou not heard  what renown the goodly Orestes gat him among all men in  that he slew the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus,  who killed his famous sire? And thou, too, my friend, for I  see that thou art very comely and tall, be valiant, that  even men unborn may praise thee. But I will now go down to  the swift ship and to my men, who methinks chafe much at  tarrying for me; and do thou thyself take heed and give ear  unto my words.'    Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: 'Sir, verily  thou speakest these things out of a friendly heart, as a  father to his son, and never will I forget them. But now I  pray thee abide here, though eager to be gone, to the end  that after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart's desire,  thou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit, with a  costly gift and very goodly, to be an heirloom of my  giving, such as dear friends give to friends.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: 'Hold me  now no longer, that am eager for the way. But whatsoever  gift thine heart shall bid thee give me, when I am on my  way back let it be mine to carry home: bear from thy stores  a gift right goodly, and it shall bring thee the worth  thereof in return.'    So spake she and departed, the grey-eyed Athene, and like  an eagle of the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she  planted might and courage, and put him in mind of his  father yet more than heretofore. And he marked the thing  and was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god; and anon  he went among the wooers, a godlike man.    Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers, and  they sat listening in silence; and his song was of the  pitiful return of the Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on  them as they came forth from Troy. And from her upper  chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, caught the  glorious strain, and she went down the high stairs from her  chamber, not alone, for two of her handmaids bare her  company. Now when the fair lady had come unto the wooers,  she stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof holding up  her glistening tire before her face; and a faithful maiden  stood on either side her. Then she fell a weeping, and  spake unto the divine minstrel:    'Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals,  deeds of men and gods, which bards rehearse, some one of  these do thou sing as thou sittest by them, and let them  drink their wine in silence; but cease from this pitiful  strain, that ever wastes my heart within my breast, since  to me above all women hath come a sorrow comfortless. So  dear a head do I long for in constant memory, namely, that  man whose fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos.'    Then wise Telemachus answered her, and said: 'O my mother,  why then dost thou grudge the sweet minstrel to gladden us  as his spirit moves him? It is not minstrels who are in  fault, but Zeus, methinks, is in fault, who gives to men,  that live by bread, to each one as he will. As for him it  is no blame if he sings the ill-faring of the Danaans; for  men always prize that song the most, which rings newest in  their ears. But let thy heart and mind endure to listen,  for not Odysseus only lost in Troy the day of his  returning, but many another likewise perished. Howbeit go  to thy chamber and mind thine own housewiferies, the loom  and distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. But  speech shall be for men, for all, but for me in chief; for  mine is the lordship in the house.'    Then in amaze she went back to her chamber, for she laid up  the wise saying of her son in her heart. She ascended to  her upper chamber with the women her handmaids, and then  was bewailing Odysseus, her dear lord, till grey-eyed  Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.    Now the wooers clamoured throughout the shadowy halls, and  each one uttered a prayer to be her bedfellow. And wise  Telemachus first spake among them:    'Wooers of my mother, men despiteful out of measure, let us  feast now and make merry and let there be no brawling; for,  lo, it is a good thing to list to a minstrel such as him,  like to the gods in voice. But in the morning let us all go  to the assembly and sit us down, that I may declare my  saying outright, to wit that ye leave these halls: and busy  yourselves with other feasts, eating your own substance,  going in turn from house to house. But if ye deem this a  likelier and a better thing, that one man's goods should  perish without atonement, then waste ye as ye will; and I  will call upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus may  grant that acts of recompense be made: so should ye  hereafter perish within the halls without atonement.'    So spake he, and all that heard him bit their lips and  marvelled at Telemachus, in that he spake boldly.    Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: 'Telemachus,  in very truth the gods themselves instruct thee to be proud  of speech and boldly to harangue. Never may Cronion make  thee king in seagirt Ithaca, which thing is of inheritance  thy right!'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Antinous,  wilt thou indeed be wroth at the word that I shall say?  Yea, at the hand of Zeus would I be fain to take even this  thing upon me. Sayest thou that this is the worst hap that  can befal a man? Nay, verily, it is no ill thing to be a  king: the house of such an one quickly waxeth rich and  himself is held in greater honour. Howsoever there are many  other kings of the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca, kings young  and old; someone of them shall surely have this kingship  since goodly Odysseus is dead. But as for me, I will be  lord of our own house and thralls, that goodly Odysseus gat  me with his spear.'    Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying:  'Telemachus, on the knees of the gods it surely lies, what  man is to be king over the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca. But  mayest thou keep thine own possessions and be lord in thine  own house! Never may that man come, who shall wrest from  thee thy substance violently in thine own despite while  Ithaca yet stands. But I would ask thee, friend, concerning  the stranger--whence he is, and of what land he avows him  to be? Where are his kin and his native fields? Doth he  bear some tidings of thy father on his road, or cometh he  thus to speed some matter of his own? In such wise did he  start up, and lo, he was gone, nor tarried he that we  should know him;--and yet he seemed no mean man to look  upon.' {*}    {* The [Greek] explains the expression of surprise at the  sudden departure of the stranger.}    Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Eurymachus,  surely the day of my father's returning hath gone by.  Therefore no more do I put faith in tidings, whencesoever  they may come, neither have I regard unto any divination,  whereof my mother may inquire at the lips of a diviner,  when she hath bidden him to the hall. But as for that man,  he is a friend of my house from Taphos, and he avows him to  be Mentes, son of wise Anchialus, and he hath lordship  among the Taphians, lovers of the oar.'    So spake Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the deathless  goddess. Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the  delightsome song, and made merry, and waited till evening  should come on. And as they made merry, dusk evening came  upon them. Then they went each one to his own house to lie  down to rest.    But Telemachus, where his chamber was builded high up in  the fair court, in a place with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#6)"],[1,"dome, how many years ago one trembles to think.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us next proceed to the subject of palaeoliths. There is, at any  rate, no doubt about them. Yet, rather more than half a century ago,  when the Abbe Boucher de Perthes found palaeoliths in the gravels of  the Somme at Abbeville, and was the first to recognize them for what  they are, there was no small scandal. Now-a-days, however, the world  takes it as a matter of course that those lumpish, discoloured, and  much-rolled stones, shaped something like a pear, which come from the  high terraces deposited by the Ancient Thames, were once upon a time  the weapons or tools of somebody who had plenty of muscle in his arm.  Plenty of skill he had in his fingers, too; for to chip a flint-pebble  along both faces, till it takes a more or less symmetrical and standard  shape, is not so easy as it sounds. Hammer away yourself at such a  pebble, and see what a mess you make of it. To go back for one moment  to the subject of eoliths, we may fairly argue that experimental forms  still ruder than the much-trimmed palaeoliths of the early river-drift  must exist somewhere, whether Mr. Harrison's eoliths are to be classed  amongst them or not. Indeed, the Tasmanians of modern days carved their  simple tools so roughly, that any one ignorant of their history might  easily mistake the greater number for common pieces of stone. On the  other hand, as we move on from the earlier to the later types of  river-drift implements, we note how by degrees practice makes perfect.  The forms grow ever more regular and refined, up to the point of time  which has been chosen as the limit for the first of the three main  stages into which the vast palaeolithic epoch has to be broken up.  The man of the late St. Acheul period, as it is termed, was truly a  great artist in his way. If you stare vacantly at his handiwork in  a museum, you are likely to remain cold to its charm. But probe about  in a gravel-bed till you have the good fortune to light on a  masterpiece; tenderly smooth away with your fingers the dirt sticking  to its surface, and bring to view the tapering or oval outline, the  straight edge, the even and delicate chipping over both faces; then,  wrapping it carefully in your handkerchief, take it home to wash, and  feast till bedtime on the clean feel and shining mellow colour of what  is hardly more an implement than a gem. They took a pride in their  work, did the men of old; and, until you can learn to sympathize, you  are no anthropologist.    During the succeeding main stage of the palaeolithic epoch there was  a decided set-back in the culture, as judged by the quality of the  workmanship in flint. Those were the days of the Mousterians who dined  off woolly rhinoceros in Jersey. Their stone implements, worked only  on one face, are poor things by comparison with those of late St. Acheul  days, though for a time degenerated forms of the latter seem to have  remained in use. What had happened? We can only guess. Probably  something to do with the climate was at the bottom of this change for  the worse. Thus M. Rutot believes that during the ice-age each big  freeze was followed by an equally big flood, preceding each fresh  return of milder weather. One of these floods, he thinks, must have  drowned out the neat-fingered race of St. Acheul, and left the coast  clear for the Mousterians with their coarser type of culture. Perhaps  they were coarser in their physical type as well.[1]    [Footnote 1: Theirs was certainly the rather ape-like Neanderthal  build. If, however, the skull found at Galley Hill, near Northfleet  in Kent, amongst the gravels laid down by the Thames when it was about  ninety feet above its present level, is of early palaeolithic date,  as some good authorities believe, there was a kind of man away back  in the drift-period who had a fairly high forehead and moderate  brow-ridges, and in general was a less brutal specimen of humanity  than our Mousterian friend of the large grinders.]    To the credit of the Mousterians, however, must be set down the fact  that they are associated with the habit of living in caves, and perhaps  may even have started it; though some implements of the drift type  occur in Le Moustier itself, as well as in other caves, such as the  famous Kent's Cavern near Torquay. Climate, once more, has very  possibly to answer for having thus driven man underground. Anyway,  whether because they must, or because they liked it, the Mousterians  went on with their cave life during an immense space of time, making  little progress; unless it were to learn gradually how to sharpen bones  into implements. But caves and bones alike were to play a far more  striking part in the days immediately to follow.    The third and last main stage of the palaeolithic epoch developed by  degrees into a golden age of art. But I cannot dwell on all its glories.  I must pass by the beautiful work in flint; such as the thin blades  of laurel-leaf pattern, fairly common in France but rare in England,  belonging to the stage or type of culture known as the Solutrian (from  Solutre in the department of Saone-et-Loire). I must also pass by the  exquisite French examples of the carvings or engravings of bone and  ivory; a single engraving of a horse's head, from the cave at Creswell  Crags in Derbyshire, being all that England has to offer in this line.  Any good museum can show you specimens or models of these delightful  objects; whereas the things about which I am going to speak must remain  hidden away for ever where their makers left them--I mean the paintings  and engravings on the walls of the French and Spanish caves.    I invite you to accompany me in the spirit first of all to the cave  of Gargas near Aventiron, under the shadow of the Pic du Midi in the  High Pyrenees. Half-way up a hill, in the midst of a wilderness of  rocky fragments, the relics of the ice-age, is a smallish hole, down  which we clamber into a spacious but low-roofed grotto, stretching  back five hundred feet or so into infinite darkness. Hard by the mouth,  where the light of day freely enters, are the remains of a hearth,  with bone-refuse and discarded implements mingling with the ashes to  a considerable depth. A glance at these implements, for instance the  small flint scraper with narrow high back and perpendicular chipping  along the sides, is enough to show that the men who once warmed their  fingers here were of the so-called Aurignacian type (Aurignac in the  department of Haute Garonne, in southern France), that is to say, lived  somewhere about the dawn of the third stage of the palaeolithic epoch.  Directly after their disappearance nature would seem to have sealed  up the cave again until our time, so that we can study them here all  by themselves.    Now let us take our lamps and explore the secrets of the interior.  The icy torrents that hollowed it in the limestone have eaten away  rounded alcoves along the sides. On the white surface of these, glazed  over with a preserving film of stalactite, we at once notice the  outlines of many hands. Most of them left hands, showing that the  Aurignacians tended to be right-handed, like ourselves, and dusted  on the paint, black manganese or red ochre, between the outspread  fingers in just way that we, too, would find convenient. Curiously  enough, this practice of stencilling hands upon the walls of caves  is in vogue amongst the Australian natives; though unfortunately, they  keep the reason, if there is any deeper one than mere amusement,  strictly to themselves. Like the Australians, again, and other rude  peoples, these Aurignacians would appear to have been given to lopping  off an occasional finger--from some religious motive, we may guess--to  judge from the mutilated look of a good many of the handprints.    The use of paint is here limited to this class of wall-decoration.  But a sharp flint makes an excellent graving tool; and the Aurignacian  hunter is bent on reproducing by this means the forms of those  game-animals about which he doubtless dreams night and day. His efforts  in this direction, however, rather remind us of those of our  infant-schools. Look at this bison. His snout is drawn sideways, but  the horns branch out right and left as if in a full-face view. Again,  our friend scamps details such as the legs. Sheer want of skill, we  may suspect, leads him to construct what is more like the symbol of  something thought than the portrait of something seen. And so we wander  farther and farther into the gloomy depths, adding ever new specimens  to our pre-historic menagerie, including the rare find of a bird that  looks uncommonly like the penguin. Mind, by the way, that you do not  fall into that round hole in the floor. It is enormously deep; and  more than forty cave-bears have left their skeletons at the bottom,  amongst which your skeleton would be a little out of place.    Next day let us move off eastwards to the Little Pyrenees to see another  cave, Niaux, high up in a valley scarred nearly up to the top by former  glaciers. This cave is about a mile deep; and it will take you half  a mile of awkward groping amongst boulders and stalactites, not to  mention a choke in one part of the passage such as must puzzle a fat  man, before the cavern becomes spacious, and you find yourself in the  vast underground cathedral that pre-historic man has chosen for his  picture-gallery. This was a later stock, that had in the meantime  learnt how to draw to perfection. Consider the bold black and white  of that portrait of a wild pony, with flowing mane and tail, glossy  barrel, and jolly snub-nosed face. It is four or five feet across,  and not an inch of the work is out of scale. The same is true of nearly  every one of the other fifty or more figures of game-animals. These  artists could paint what they saw.    Yet they could paint up on the walls what"]]]
