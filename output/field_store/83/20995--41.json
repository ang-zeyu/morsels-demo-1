Small wonder  that They should have taken the pains to unroll before their eyes the  truths of Their respective Revelations, and should have expatiated on  Their woes and sufferings. Small wonder that They should have stressed the  preciousness of the opportunities which it was in the power of these  rulers and leaders to seize, and should have warned them in ominous tones  of the grave responsibilities which the rejection of God's Message would  entail, and should have predicted, when rebuffed and refused, the dire  consequences which such a rejection involved. Small wonder that He Who is  the King of kings and Vicegerent of God Himself should, when abandoned,  contemned and persecuted, have uttered this epigrammatic and momentous  prophecy: \"From two ranks amongst men power hath been seized: kings and  ecclesiastics.\"    As to the kings and emperors who not only symbolized in their persons the  majesty of earthly dominion but who, for the most part, actually held  unchallengeable sway over the multitudes of their subjects, their relation  to the Faith of Baha'u'llah constitutes one of the most illuminating  episodes in the history of the Heroic and Formative Ages of that Faith.  The Divine summons which embraced within its scope so large a number of  the crowned heads of both Europe and Asia; the theme and language of the  Messages that brought them into direct contact with the Source of God's  Revelation; the nature of their reaction to so stupendous an impact; and  the consequences which ensued and can still be witnessed today are the  salient features of a subject upon which I can but inadequately touch, and  which will be fully and befittingly treated by future Baha'i historians.    The Emperor of the French, the most powerful ruler of his day on the  European continent, Napoleon III; Pope Pius IX, the supreme head of the  highest church in Christendom, and wielder of the scepter of both temporal  and spiritual authority; the omnipotent Czar of the vast Russian Empire,  Alexander II; the renowned Queen Victoria, whose sovereignty extended over  the greatest political combination the world has witnessed; William I, the  conqueror of Napoleon III, King of Prussia and the newly acclaimed monarch  of a unified Germany; Francis Joseph, the autocratic king-emperor of the  Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the heir of the far-famed Holy Roman Empire;  the tyrannical 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, the embodiment of the concentrated power  vested in the Sultanate and the Caliphate; the notorious Nasiri'd-Din  _Sh_ah, the despotic ruler of Persia and the mightiest potentate of  _Sh_i'ih Islam--in a word, most of the preeminent embodiments of power and  of sovereignty in His day became, one by one, the object of Baha'u'llah's  special attention, and were made to sustain, in varying degrees, the  weight of the force communicated by His appeals and warnings.    It should be borne in mind, however, that Baha'u'llah has not restricted  the delivery of His Message to a few individual sovereigns, however potent  the scepters they severally wielded, and however vast the dominions which  they ruled. All the kings of the earth have been collectively addressed by  His Pen, appealed to, and warned, at a time when the star of His  Revelation was mounting its zenith, and whilst He lay a prisoner in the  hands, and in the vicinity of the court, of His royal enemy. In a  memorable Tablet, designated as the Suriy-i-Muluk (Surih of Kings) in  which the Sultan himself and his ministers, and the kings of Christendom,  and the French and Persian Ambassadors accredited to the Sublime Porte,  and the Muslim ecclesiastical leaders in Constantinople, and its wise men  and its inhabitants, and the people of Persia, and the philosophers of the  world have been specifically addressed and admonished, He thus directs His  words to the entire company of the monarchs of East and West:            TABLETS TO THE KINGS      \"O kings of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this  sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill,  upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: 'There is none other God but He,  the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.'... Fear God, O concourse of  kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime  grace. Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the  Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great. Set your hearts towards the Face of  God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow, and be  not of those who perish. Relate unto them, O servant, the story of 'Ali  [the Bab], when He came unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and  weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and  holy and blessed tokens from Him. Ye, however, O kings, have failed to  heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be guided by the lights  which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent Heaven. Ye  examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than  all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained  careless until the divines of Persia--those cruel ones--pronounced judgment  against Him, and unjustly slew Him. His spirit ascended unto God, and the  eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept  sore by reason of this cruelty. Beware that ye be not careless henceforth  as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto God, your Maker,  and be not of the heedless.... My face hath come forth from the veils, and  shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye  turned not towards Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, O  concourse of kings! Follow, therefore, that which I speak unto you, and  hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside.  For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather in your  nearness unto God and your observance of His command as sent down in His  holy and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole  earth, and over all that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands,  its mountains, and its plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these  would profit him not, could ye but know it.... Arise, then, and make  steadfast your feet, and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you,  and set then yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty  Ocean, so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath stored  up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you....  Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the  breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be  quickened....\"    \"Lay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth,\" He, in that same  Tablet has revealed, \"and beware that ye transgress not the bounds which  the Almighty hath fixed. Observe the injunctions laid upon you in His  Book, and take good heed not to overstep their limits. Be vigilant, that  ye may not do injustice to anyone, be it to the extent of a grain of  mustard seed. Tread ye the path of justice, for this, verily, is the  straight path. Compose your differences, and reduce your armaments, that  the burden of your expenditures may be lightened, and that your minds and  hearts may be tranquilized. Heal the dissensions that divide you, and ye  will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of  your cities and territories demandeth. Fear ye God, and take heed not to  outstrip the bounds of moderation, and be numbered among the extravagant.  We have learned that you are increasing your outlay every year, and are  laying the burden thereof on your subjects. This, verily, is more than  they can bear, and is a grievous injustice. Decide justly between men, and  be ye the emblems of justice amongst them. This, if ye judge fairly, is  the thing that behooveth you, and beseemeth your station.    \"Beware not to deal unjustly with anyone that appealeth to you, and  entereth beneath your shadow. Walk ye in the fear of God, and be ye of  them that lead a godly life. Rest not on your power, your armies, and  treasures. Put your whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created  you, and seek ye His help in all your affairs. Succor cometh from Him  alone. He succoreth whom He willeth with the hosts of the heavens and of  the earth.    \"Know ye that the poor are the trust of God in your midst. Watch that ye  betray not His trust, that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk  not in the ways of the treacherous. Ye will most certainly be called upon  to answer for His trust on the day when the Balance of Justice shall be  set, the day when unto everyone shall be rendered his due, when the doings  of all men, be they rich or poor, shall be weighed.    \"If ye pay no heed unto the counsels which, in peerless and unequivocal  language, We have revealed in this Tablet, Divine chastisement shall  assail you from every direction, and the sentence of His justice shall be  pronounced against you. On that day ye shall have no power to resist Him,  and shall recognize your own impotence. Have mercy on yourselves and on  those beneath you, and judge ye between them according to the precepts  prescribed by God in His most holy and exalted Tablet, a Tablet wherein He  hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure, in which He  hath given, with distinctness, an explanation of all things, and which is  in itself a monition unto them that believe in Him.    \"Examine Our Cause, inquire into the things that have befallen Us, and  decide justly between Us and Our enemies, and be ye of them that act  equitably towards their neighbors. If ye stay not the hand of the  oppressor, if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, what  right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men? What is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#6)"],[1,"religions of the world are at war among themselves.  For 1,300 years, Christians and Mussulmans have been quarrelling, when  with very little effort their differences and disputes could be overcome  and peace and harmony could exist between them and the world could be at  rest!    In the Qur'an we read that Muhammad spoke to his followers, saying:    'Why do you not believe in Christ, and in the Gospel? Why will you not  accept Moses and the Prophets, for surely the Bible is the Book of God? In  truth, Moses was a sublime Prophet, and Jesus was filled with the Holy  Spirit. He came to the world through the Power of God, born of the Holy  Spirit and of the blessed Virgin Mary. Mary, His mother, was a saint from  Heaven. She passed her days in the Temple at prayer and food was sent to  her from above. Her father, Zacharias, came to her and asked her from  whence the food came, and Mary made answer, \"From on high.\" Surely God  made Mary to be exalted above all other women.'    This is what Muhammad taught His people concerning Jesus and Moses, and He  reproached them for their lack of faith in these great Teachers, and  taught them the lessons of truth and tolerance. Muhammad was sent from God  to work among a people as savage and uncivilized as the wild beasts. They  were quite devoid of understanding, nor had they any feelings of love,  sympathy and pity. Women were so degraded and despised that a man could  bury his daughter alive, and he had as many wives to be his slaves as he  chose.    Among these half animal people Muhammad was sent with His divine Message.  He taught the people that idol worship was wrong, but that they should  reverence Christ, Moses and the Prophets. Under His influence they became  a more enlightened and civilized people and arose from the degraded state  in which He found them. Was not this a good work, and worthy of all  praise, respect and love?    Look at the Gospel of the Lord Christ and see how glorious it is! Yet even  today men fail to understand its priceless beauty, and misinterpret its  words of wisdom.    Christ forbade war! When the disciple Peter, thinking to defend his Lord,  cut off the ear of the servant of the High Priest, Christ said to him:  'Put up thy sword into the sheath'.(4) Yet, in spite of the direct command  of the Lord they profess to serve--men still dispute, make war, and kill  one another, and His counsels and teaching seem quite forgotten.    But do not therefore attribute to the Masters and Prophets the evil deeds  of their followers. If the priests, teachers and people, lead lives which  are contrary to the religion they profess to follow, is that the fault of  Christ or the other Teachers?    The people of Islam were taught to realize how Jesus came from God and was  born of the Spirit, and that He must be glorified of all men. Moses was a  prophet of God, and revealed in His day and for the people to whom He was  sent, the Book of God.    Muhammad recognized the sublime grandeur of Christ and the greatness of  Moses and the prophets. If only the whole world would acknowledge the  greatness of Muhammad and all the Heaven-sent Teachers, strife and discord  would soon vanish from the face of the earth, and God's Kingdom would come  among men.    The people of Islam who glorify Christ are not humiliated by so doing.    Christ was the Prophet of the Christians, Moses of the Jews--why should not  the followers of each prophet recognize and honour the other prophets  also? If men could only learn the lesson of mutual tolerance,  understanding, and brotherly love, the unity of the world would soon be an  established fact.    Baha'u'llah spent His life teaching this lesson of Love and Unity. Let us  then put away from us all prejudice and intolerance, and strive with all  our hearts and souls to bring about understanding and unity between  Christians and Mussulmans.          THE BENEFITS OF GOD TO MAN      4 Avenue de Camoeens,  October 27th    God alone ordereth all things and is all-powerful. Why then does He send  trials to His servants?    The trials of man are of two kinds. (a) The consequences of his own  actions. If a man eats too much, he ruins his digestion; if he takes  poison he becomes ill or dies. If a person gambles he will lose his money;  if he drinks too much he will lose his equilibrium. All these sufferings  are caused by the man himself, it is quite clear therefore that certain  sorrows are the result of our own deeds. (b) Other sufferings there are,  which come upon the Faithful of God. Consider the great sorrows endured by  Christ and by His apostles!    Those who suffer most, attain to the greatest perfection.    Those who declare a wish to suffer much for Christ's sake must prove their  sincerity; those who proclaim their longing to make great sacrifices can  only prove their truth by their deeds. Job proved the fidelity of his love  for God by being faithful through his great adversity, as well as during  the prosperity of his life. The apostles of Christ who steadfastly bore  all their trials and sufferings--did they not prove their faithfulness? Was  not their endurance the best proof?    These griefs are now ended.    Caiaphas lived a comfortable and happy life while Peter's life was full of  sorrow and trial; which of these two is the more enviable? Assuredly we  should choose the present state of Peter, for he possesses immortal life  whilst Caiaphas has won eternal shame. The trials of Peter tested his  fidelity. Tests are benefits from God, for which we should thank Him.  Grief and sorrow do not come to us by chance, they are sent to us by the  Divine Mercy for our own perfecting.    While a man is happy he may forget his God; but when grief comes and  sorrows overwhelm him, then will he remember his Father who is in Heaven,  and who is able to deliver him from his humiliations.    Men who suffer not, attain no perfection. The plant most pruned by the  gardeners is that one which, when the summer comes, will have the most  beautiful blossoms and the most abundant fruit.    The labourer cuts up the earth with his plough, and from that earth comes  the rich and plentiful harvest. The more a man is chastened, the greater  is the harvest of spiritual virtues shown forth by him. A soldier is no  good General until he has been in the front of the fiercest battle and has  received the deepest wounds.    The prayer of the prophets of God has always been, and still is: Oh God, I  long to lay down my life in the path to Thee! I desire to shed my blood  for Thee, and to make the supreme sacrifice.          BEAUTY AND HARMONY IN DIVERSITY      October 28th    The Creator of all is One God.    From this same God all creation sprang into existence, and He is the one  goal, towards which everything in nature yearns. This conception was  embodied in the words of Christ, when He said, 'I am the Alpha and the  Omega, the beginning and the end'. Man is the sum of Creation, and the  Perfect Man is the expression of the complete thought of the Creator--the  Word of God.    Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in  species, yet with one sole origin. All the differences that appear are  those of outward form and colour. This diversity of type is apparent  throughout the whole of nature.    Behold a beautiful garden full of flowers, shrubs, and trees. Each flower  has a different charm, a peculiar beauty, its own delicious perfume and  beautiful colour. The trees too, how varied are they in size, in growth,  in foliage--and what different fruits they bear! Yet all these flowers,  shrubs and trees spring from the self-same earth, the same sun shines upon  them and the same clouds give them rain.    So it is with humanity. It is made up of many races, and its peoples are  of different colour, white, black, yellow, brown and red--but they all come  from the same God, and all are servants to Him. This diversity among the  children of men has unhappily not the same effect as it has among the  vegetable creation, where the spirit shown is more harmonious. Among men  exists the diversity of animosity, and it is this that causes war and  hatred among the different nations of the world.    Differences which are only those of blood also cause them to destroy and  kill one another. Alas! that this should still be so. Let us look rather  at the beauty in diversity, the beauty of harmony, and learn a lesson from  the vegetable creation. If you beheld a garden in which all the plants  were the same as to form, colour and perfume, it would not seem beautiful  to you at all, but, rather, monotonous and dull. The garden which is  pleasing to the eye and which makes the heart glad, is the garden in which  are growing side by side flowers of every hue, form and perfume, and the  joyous contrast of colour is what makes for charm and beauty. So is it  with trees. An orchard full of fruit trees is a delight; so is a  plantation planted with many species of shrubs. It is just the diversity  and variety that constitutes its charm; each flower, each tree, each  fruit, beside being beautiful in itself, brings out by contrast the  qualities of the others, and shows to advantage the special loveliness of  each and all.    Thus should it be among the children of men! The diversity in the human  family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where  many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. If  you meet those of different race and colour from yourself, do not mistrust  them and withdraw yourself into your shell of conventionality, but rather  be glad and show them kindness. Think of them as different coloured roses  growing in the beautiful garden of humanity, and rejoice to be among them.    Likewise, when you meet those whose opinions differ from your own, do not  turn away your face from them. All are seeking truth, and there are many  roads leading thereto. Truth has many aspects, but it"]]]
