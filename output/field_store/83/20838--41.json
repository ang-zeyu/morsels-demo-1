Time shall teach him that the scholar loses no hour  which the man lives. Herein he unfolds the sacred germ of his  instinct, screened from influence. What is lost in seemliness is  gained in strength. Not out of those on whom systems of education have  exhausted their culture comes the helpful giant to destroy the old or  to build the new, but out of unhandselled[54] savage nature; out of  terrible Druids[55] and Berserkers[56] come at last Alfred[57] and  Shakespeare. I hear therefore with joy whatever is beginning to be  said of the dignity and necessity of labor to every citizen. There is  virtue yet in the hoe and the spade,[58] for learned as well as for  unlearned hands. And labor is everywhere welcome; always we are  invited to work; only be this limitation observed, that a man shall  not for the sake of wider activity sacrifice any opinion to the  popular judgments and modes of action.           *       *       *       *       *    I have now spoken of the education of the scholar by nature, by books,  and by action. It remains to say somewhat of his duties.    They are such as become Man Thinking. They may all be comprised in  self-trust. The office of the scholar is to cheer, to raise, and to  guide men by showing them facts amidst appearances. He plies the slow,  unhonored, and unpaid task of observation. Flamsteed[59] and  Herschel,[60] in their glazed observatories, may catalogue the stars  with the praise of all men, and, the results being splendid and  useful, honor is sure. But he, in his private observatory, cataloguing  obscure and nebulous[61] stars of the human mind, which as yet no man  has thought of as such,--watching days and months sometimes for a few  facts; correcting still his old records,--must relinquish display and  immediate fame. In the long period of his preparation he must betray  often an ignorance and shiftlessness in popular arts, incurring the  disdain of the able who shoulder him aside. Long he must stammer in  his speech; often forego the living for the dead. Worse yet, he must  accept--how often!--poverty and solitude. For the ease and pleasure of  treading the old road, accepting the fashions, the education, the  religion of society, he takes the cross of making his own, and, of  course, the self-accusation, the faint heart, the frequent uncertainty  and loss of time, which are the nettles and tangling vines in the way  of the self-relying and self-directed; and the state of virtual  hostility in which he seems to stand to society, and especially to  educated society. For all this loss and scorn, what offset? He is to  find consolation in exercising the highest functions of human nature.  He is one who raises himself from private considerations and breathes  and lives on public and illustrious thoughts. He is the world's eye.  He is the world's heart. He is to resist the vulgar prosperity that  retrogrades ever to barbarism, by preserving and communicating heroic  sentiments, noble biographies, melodious verse, and the conclusions of  history. Whatsoever oracles the human heart, in all emergencies, in  all solemn hours, has uttered as its commentary on the world of  actions,--these he shall receive and impart. And whatsoever new  verdict Reason from her inviolable seat pronounces on the passing men  and events of to-day,--this he shall hear and promulgate.    These being his functions, it becomes him to feel all confidence in  himself, and to defer never to the popular cry. He and he only knows  the world. The world of any moment is the merest appearance. Some  great decorum, some fetich[62] of a government, some ephemeral trade,  or war, or man, is cried up[63] by half mankind and cried down by the  other half, as if all depended on this particular up or down. The odds  are that the whole question is not worth the poorest thought which the  scholar has lost in listening to the controversy. Let him not quit his  belief that a popgun is a popgun, though the ancient and honorable[64]  of the earth affirm it to be the crack of doom. In silence, in  steadiness, in severe abstraction, let him hold by himself; add  observation to observation, patient of neglect, patient of reproach,  and bide his own time,--happy enough if he can satisfy himself alone  that this day he has seen something truly. Success treads on every  right step. For the instinct is sure that prompts him to tell his  brother what he thinks. He then learns that in going down into the  secrets of his own mind he has descended into the secrets of all  minds. He learns that he who has mastered any law in his private  thoughts is master to that extent of all men whose language he speaks,  and of all into whose language his own can be translated. The poet, in  utter solitude remembering his spontaneous thoughts and recording  them, is found to have recorded that which men in cities vast find  true for them also. The orator distrusts at first the fitness of his  frank confessions, his want of knowledge of the persons he addresses,  until he finds that he is the complement[65] of his hearers;--that  they drink his words because he fulfills for them their own nature;  the deeper he dives into his privatest, secretest presentiment, to his  wonder he finds this is the most acceptable, most public and  universally true. The people delight in it; the better part of every  man feels--This is my music; this is myself.    In self-trust all the virtues are comprehended. Free should the  scholar be,--free and brave. Free even to the definition of freedom,  \"without any hindrance that does not arise out of his own  constitution.\" Brave; for fear is a thing which a scholar by his very  function puts behind him. Fear always springs from ignorance. It is a  shame to him if his tranquility, amid dangerous times, arise from the  presumption that like children and women his is a protected class; or  if he seek a temporary peace by the diversion of his thoughts from  politics or vexed questions, hiding his head like an ostrich in the  flowering bushes, peeping into microscopes, and turning rhymes, as a  boy whistles to keep his courage up. So is the danger a danger still;  so is the fear worse. Manlike let him turn and face it. Let him look  into its eye and search its nature, inspect its origin,--see the  whelping of this lion,--which lies no great way back; he will then  find in himself a perfect comprehension of its nature and extent; he  will have made his hands meet on the other side, and can henceforth  defy it and pass on superior. The world is his who can see through its  pretension. What deafness, what stone-blind custom, what overgrown  error you behold is there only by sufferance,--by your sufferance. See  it to be a lie, and you have already dealt it its mortal blow.    Yes, we are the cowed,--we the trustless. It is a mischievous notion  that we are come late into nature; that the world was finished a long  time ago. As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of God, so  it is ever to so much of his attributes as we bring to it. To  ignorance and sin it is flint. They adapt themselves to it as they  may; but in proportion as a man has any thing in him divine, the  firmament flows before him and takes his signet[66] and form. Not he  is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state of mind.  They are the kings of the world who give the color of their present  thought to all nature and all art, and persuade men, by the cheerful  serenity of their carrying the matter, that this thing which they do  is the apple which the ages have desired to pluck, now at last ripe,  and inviting nations to the harvest. The great man makes the great  thing. Wherever Macdonald[67] sits, there is the head of the table.  Linnaeus[68] makes botany the most alluring of studies, and wins it  from the farmer and the herb-woman: Davy,[69] chemistry; and  Cuvier,[70] fossils. The day is always his who works in it with  serenity and great aims. The unstable estimates of men crowd to him  whose mind is filled with a truth, as the heaped waves of the Atlantic  follow the moon.[71]    For this self-trust, the reason is deeper than can be fathomed,--darker  than can be enlightened. I might not carry with me the feeling of my  audience in stating my own belief. But I have already shown the ground  of my hope, in adverting to the doctrine that man is one. I believe man  has been wronged; he has wronged himself. He has almost lost the light  that can lead him back to his prerogatives. Men are become of no  account. Men in history, men in the world of to-day, are bugs, are  spawn, and are called \"the mass\" and \"the herd.\" In a century, in a  millennium, one or two men;[72] that is to say, one or two  approximations to the right state of every man. All the rest behold in  the hero or the poet their own green and crude being,--ripened; yes, and  are content to be less, so _that_ may attain to its full stature. What a  testimony, full of grandeur, full of pity, is borne to the demands of  his own nature, by the poor clansman, the poor partisan, who rejoices in  the glory of his chief! The poor and the low find some amends to their  immense moral capacity, for their acquiescence in a political and social  inferiority.[73] They are content to be brushed like flies from the path  of a great person, so that justice shall be done by him to that common  nature which it is the dearest desire of all to see enlarged and  glorified. They sun themselves in the great man's light, and feel it to  be their own element. They cast the dignity of man from their downtrod  selves upon the shoulders of a hero, and will perish to add one drop of  blood to make that great heart beat, those giant sinews combat and  conquer.

One  theory connects them with the lank-haired and beardless Mongolians,  and it is asserted on the evidence afforded by early sculptural  reliefs that they were similarly oblique-eyed. As they also spoke an  agglutinative language, it is suggested that they were descended from  the same parent stock as the Chinese in an ancient Parthian homeland.  If, however, the oblique eye was not the result of faulty and  primitive art, it is evident that the Mongolian type, which is  invariably found to be remarkably persistent in racial blends, did not  survive in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys, for in the finer and more  exact sculpture work of the later Sumerian period the eyes of the  ruling classes are found to be similar to those of the Ancient  Egyptians and southern Europeans. Other facial characteristics suggest  that a Mongolian racial connection is highly improbable; the prominent  Sumerian nose, for instance, is quite unlike the Chinese, which is  diminutive. Nor can far-reaching conclusions be drawn from the scanty  linguistic evidence at our disposal. Although the languages of the  Sumerians and long-headed Chinese are of the agglutinative variety, so  are those also which are spoken by the broad-headed Turks and Magyars  of Hungary, the broad-headed and long-headed, dark and fair Finns, and  the brunet and short-statured Basques with pear-shaped faces, who are  regarded as a variation of the Mediterranean race with distinctive  characteristics developed in isolation. Languages afford no sure  indication of racial origins or affinities.    Another theory connects the Sumerians with the broad-headed peoples of  the Western Asian plains and plateaus, who are vaguely grouped as  Ural-Altaic stock and are represented by the present-day Turks and the  dark variety of Finns. It is assumed that they migrated southward in  remote times in consequence of tribal pressure caused by changing  climatic conditions, and abandoned a purely pastoral for an  agricultural life. The late Sumerian sculpture work again presents  difficulties in this connection, for the faces and bulging occiputs  suggest rather a long-headed than a broad-headed type, and the theory  no longer obtains that new habits of life alter skull forms which are  usually associated with other distinctive traits in the structure of  skeletons. These broad-headed nomadic peoples of the Steppes are  allied to Tatar stock, and distinguished from the pure Mongols by  their abundance of wavy hair and beard. The fact that the Sumerians  shaved their scalps and faces is highly suggestive in this connection.  From the earliest times it has been the habit of most peoples to  emphasize their racial characteristics so as to be able, one may  suggest, to distinguish readily a friend from a foeman. At any rate  this fact is generally recognized by ethnologists. The Basques, for  instance, shave their pointed chins and sometimes grow short side  whiskers to increase the distinctive pear-shape which is given to  their faces by their prominent temples. In contrast, their neighbours,  the Andalusians, grow chin whiskers to broaden their already rounded  chins, and to distinguish them markedly from the Basques.[12] Another  example of similar character is afforded in Asia Minor, where the  skulls of the children of long-headed Kurds are narrowed, and those of  the children of broad-headed Armenians made flatter behind as a result  of systematic pressure applied by using cradle boards. In this way  these rival peoples accentuate their contrasting head forms, which at  times may, no doubt, show a tendency towards variation as a result of  the crossment of types. When it is found, therefore, that the  Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, were in the habit of shaving,  their ethnic affinities should be looked for among a naturally  glabrous rather than a heavily-bearded people.    A Central Asiatic source for Sumerian culture has also been urged of  late with much circumstantial detail. It breaks quite fresh and  interesting ground. Recent scientific expeditions in Russian and  Chinese Turkestan have accumulated important archaeological data which  clearly establish that vast areas of desert country were at a remote  period most verdurous and fruitful, and thickly populated by organized  and apparently progressive communities. From these ancient centres of  civilization wholesale migrations must have been impelled from time to  time in consequence of the gradual encroachment of wind-distributed  sand and the increasing shortage of water. At Anau in Russian  Turkestan, where excavations were conducted by the Pumpelly  expedition, abundant traces were found of an archaic and forgotten  civilization reaching back to the Late Stone Age. The pottery is  decorated with geometric designs, and resembles somewhat other  Neolithic specimens found as far apart as Susa, the capital of ancient  Elam, on the borders of Babylonia, Boghaz Koei in Asia Minor, the seat  of Hittite administration, round the Black Sea to the north, and at  points in the southern regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is  suggested that these various finds are scattered evidences of early  racial drifts from the Central Asian areas which were gradually being  rendered uninhabitable. Among the Copper Age artifacts at Anau are  clay votive statuettes resembling those which were used in Sumeria for  religious purposes. These, however, cannot be held to prove a racial  connection, but they are important in so far as they afford evidence  of early trade relations in a hitherto unsuspected direction, and the  long distances over which cultural influence extended before the dawn  of history. Further we cannot go. No inscriptions have yet been  discovered to render articulate this mysterious Central Asian  civilization, or to suggest the original source of early Sumerian  picture writing. Nor is it possible to confirm Mr. Pumpelly's view  that from the Anau district the Sumerians and Egyptians first obtained  barley and wheat, and some of their domesticated animals. If, as  Professor Elliot Smith believes, copper was first used by the Ancient  Egyptians, it may be, on the other hand, that a knowledge of this  metal reached Anau through Sumeria, and that the elements of the  earlier culture were derived from the same quarter by an indirect  route. The evidence obtainable in Egypt is of interest in this  connection. Large quantities of food have been taken from the stomachs  and intestines of sun-dried bodies which have lain in their  pre-Dynastic graves for over sixty centuries. This material has been  carefully examined, and has yielded, among other things, husks of  barley and millet, and fragments of mammalian bones, including those,  no doubt, of the domesticated sheep and goats and cattle painted on  the pottery.[13] It is therefore apparent that at an extremely remote  period a knowledge of agriculture extended throughout Egypt, and we  have no reason for supposing that it was not shared by the  contemporary inhabitants of Sumer.    The various theories which have been propounded regarding the outside  source of Sumerian culture are based on the assumption that it  commenced abruptly and full grown. Its rude beginnings cannot be  traced on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, but although no  specimens of the earliest form of picture writing have been recovered  from the ruins of Sumerian and Akkadian cities, neither have any been  found elsewhere. The possibility remains, therefore, that early  Babylonian culture was indigenous. \"A great deal of ingenuity has been  displayed by many scholars\", says Professor Elliot Smith, \"with the  object of bringing these Sumerians from somewhere else as immigrants  into Sumer; but no reasons have been advanced to show that they had  not been settled at the head of the Persian Gulf for long generations  before they first appeared on the stage of history. The argument that  no early remains have been found is futile, not only because such a  country as Sumer is no more favourable to the preservation of such  evidence than is the Delta of the Nile, but also upon the more general  grounds that negative statements of this sort cannot be assigned a  positive evidence for an immigration.\"[14] This distinguished  ethnologist is frankly of opinion that the Sumerians were the  congeners of the pre-Dynastic Egyptians of the Mediterranean or Brown  race, the eastern branch of which reaches to India and the western to  the British Isles and Ireland. In the same ancient family are included  the Arabs, whose physical characteristics distinguish them from the  Semites of Jewish type.    Some light may be thrown on the Sumerian problem by giving  consideration to the present-day racial complexion of Western Asia.  The importance of evidence of this character has been emphasized  elsewhere. In Egypt, for instance, Dr. C.S. Myers has ascertained that  the modern peasants have skull forms which are identical with those of  their pre-Dynastic ancestors. Mr. Hawes has also demonstrated that the  ancient inhabitants of Crete are still represented on that famous  island. But even more remarkable is the fact that the distinctive  racial type which occupied the Palaeolithic caves of the Dordogne  valley in France continues to survive in their vicinity after an  interval of over twenty thousand years.[15] It is noteworthy,  therefore, to find that in south-western Asia at the present day one  particular racial type predominates over all others. Professor Ripley,  who summarizes a considerable mass of data in this connection, refers  to it as the \"Iranian\", and says: \"It includes the Persians and Kurds,  possibly the Ossetes in the Caucasus, and farther to the east a large  number of Asiatic tribes, from the Afghans to the Hindus. These  peoples are all primarily long-headed and dark brunets. They incline  to slenderness of habit, although varying in stature according to  circumstances."]]]
