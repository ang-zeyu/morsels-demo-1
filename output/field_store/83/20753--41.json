V. HYMN FOR THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMPS        Blest Lord, Creator of the glowing light,      At Whose behest the hours successive move,      The sun has set: black darkness broods above:    Christ! light Thy faithful through the coming night.      Thy courts are lit with stars unnumbered,      And in the cloudless vault the pale moon rides;      Yet Thou dost bid us seek the fire that hides    Till swift we strike it from its flinty bed.      So man may learn that in Christ's body came      The hidden hope of light to mortals given:      He is the Rock--'tis His own word--that riven    Sends forth to all our race the eternal flame.      From lamps that brim with rich and fragrant oil,      Or torches dry this heaven-sent fire we feed;      Or make us rushlights from the flowering reed    And wax, whereon the bees have spent their toil.      Bright glows the light, whether the resin thick      Of pine-brand flares, or waxen tapers burn      With melting radiance, or the hollow urn    Yields its stored sweetness to the thirsty wick.      Beneath the might of fire, in slow decay      The scented tears of glowing nectar fall;      Lower and lower droops the candle tall    And ever dwindling weeps itself away.      So by Thy gifts, great Father, hearth and hall      Are all ablaze with points of twinkling light      That vie with daylight spent; and vanquished Night    Rends, as she flies away, her sable pall.      Who knoweth not that from high Heaven first came      Our light, from God Himself the rushing fire?      For Moses erst, amid the prickly brier,    Saw God made manifest in lambent flame.      Ah, happy he! deemed worthy face to face      To see heaven's Lord within that sacred brake;      Bidden the sandals from his feet to take,    Nor with his shoon defile that holy place.      The mighty children of the chosen name,      Saved by the merits of their sires, and free      After long years of savage tyranny,    Through the drear desert followed still that flame.      Striking their camp beneath the silent night      Where'er they went, to lead their darkling way,      The cloud of glory lent its guiding ray    And shone more splendid than the noonday light.      But, mad with jealous fury, Egypt's king      Calls his great host to battle for their lord:      Swiftly the cohorts gather at his word,    And down the mail-clad lines the clarions ring.      Girding their trusty swords the warriors go      To fill the ranks; hoarse bugles rend the air;      These seize their massy javelins, these prepare    The death-winged arrow and the Cretan bow.      The footmen throng in close battalions pressed;      The chariots thunder; to the saddle spring      The riders of the Nile, as forth they fling    Egypt's proud banner with the serpent crest.      And now, forgetful of the bondage past,      Thy children, tortured by the desert heat,      Drag to the Red Sea's brink their weary feet,    And on its sandy margin rest at last.      See! with their forsworn king the savage foe      Draws nigh: the threatening squadrons nearer ride;      But ever onward urged the intrepid guide    And through the waves bade Israel fearless go.      Before that steadfast march the billows fall,      Then raise on either hand their crystal mass,      While through the sundered deep Thy people pass    And ocean guards them with a liquid wall.      But, mad with baffled rage, the dusky horde      Of Egypt, by their impious despot led,      Athirst the hated Hebrews' blood to shed    Pursued, all reckless of the o'er-arching flood.      Swift as the wind the royal squadrons ride,      But swifter yet the crystal barriers break,      The waves exultantly their bounds forsake    And roll together in a roaring tide.      'Mid steeds and chariots and drifting mail      The drowned lords of Egypt found a grave      With all their swart retainers 'neath the wave;    And in their haughty courts the mourners wail.      What tongue, O Christ, Thy glories can unfold?      Thine was the arm, outstretched in wrath, that made      The stricken land of Pharaoh, sore afraid,    Bow down before Thy minister of old.      Thy pathless deep did at the voice restrain      Its surging billows, till with Thee for guide      Thy host passed scathless, and the refluent tide    Swept down the wicked to the engulfing main.      At Thy command the desert, parched and dry,      Breaks into laughing rills, and water clear      Wells from the smitten rock Thy flock to cheer    And quench their thirst beneath that brazen sky.      Then Marah's bitterness grew passing sweet,      Touched by the mystic tree; so by the grace      Of Thine own Tree, O Christ, our sinful race    Regains its lost hopes at Thy pierced feet.      Faster than icy hail the manna falls,      Like snow down drifting from a wintry sky;      The feast is set: they heap the tables high    With that rich food from Thy celestial halls.      Fresh blow the breezes from the distant shore      And bear a fluttering cloud that hides the light,      Till the frail pinions, faltering in their flight,    Sink in the wilderness to rise no more.      How great the love of God's own Son, that shed      Such wondrous bounty on His chosen race!      And still to us He proffers in His grace    The mystic Feast, wherewith our souls are fed.      Through the world's raging sea He bids us come,      And 'twixt the sundered billows guides our path,      Till, spent and wearied with the ocean's wrath,    He calls His storm-tossed saints to Heaven and home.      There in His paradise red roses blow,      With golden daffodils and lilies pale      And gentle violets, and down the vale    The murmuring rivulets for ever flow.      Sweet balsams, welling from the slender tree,      And precious spices fill the fragrant air,      And, hiding by the stream, that blossom rare    Whose leaves the river hurries to the sea.      There the blest souls with one accord unite      To hymn in dulcet song their Saviour's praise,      And as the chanting quire their voices raise    They tread with shining feet the lilies bright.      Yea, e'en the spirits of the lost, that dwell      Where the black stream of sullen Acheron flows,      Rest on that holy night when Christ arose,    And for a while 'tis holiday in Hell.      No sun from ocean rising drives away      Their darkness, with his flaming shafts far-hurled,      But from the cross of Christ o'er that wan world    There streams the radiance of a new-born day.      The sulphurous floods with lessened fury glow,      The aching limbs find respite from their pain,      While, in glad freedom from the galling chain,    The tortured ghosts a short-lived solace know.      In holy gladness let this night be sped,      As here we gather, Lord, to watch and pray;      To Thee with one consent our vows we pay    And on Thy altar set the sacred Bread.      From pendent chains the lamps of crystal blaze;      By fragrant oil sustained the clear flame glows      With strength undimmed, and through the darkness throws    High o'er the fretted roof a golden haze,      As 'twere Heaven's starry floor our wondering eye      Beheld, wherein the Bears their light display,      Where Phosphor heralds the approach of day    And Hesper's radiance floods the evening sky.      Meet is the gift we offer here to Thee,      Father of all, as falls the dewy night;      Thine own most precious gift we bring--the light    Whereby mankind Thy other bounties see.      Thou art the Light indeed; on our dull eyes      And on our inmost souls Thy rays are poured;      To Thee we light our lamps: receive them, Lord,    Filled with the oil of peace and sacrifice.      O hear us, Father, through Thine only Son,      Our Lord and Saviour, by Whose love bequeathed      The Paraclete upon our hearts has breathed,    With Him and Thee through endless ages one.      Through Christ Thy Kingdom shall for ever be,      Thy grace, might, wisdom, glory ever shine,      As in the Triune majesty benign    He reigns for all eternity with Thee.

At qui coinquinatum"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#6)"],[1,"is opposed to the peeping mania and through which it is  eventually abolished is _shame_ (like the former loathing).    *Sadism and Masochism.*--The desire to cause pain to the sexual object  and its opposite, the most frequent and most significant of all  perversions, was designated in its two forms by v. Krafft-Ebing as  sadism or the active form, and masochism or the passive form. Other  authors prefer the narrower term algolagnia which emphasizes the  pleasure in pain and cruelty, whereas the terms selected by v.  Krafft-Ebing place the pleasure secured in all kinds of humility and  submission in the foreground.    The roots of active algolagnia, sadism, can be readily demonstrable in  the normal. The sexuality of most men shows a taint of _aggression_, it  is a propensity to subdue, the biological significance of which lies in  the necessity of overcoming the resistance of the sexual object by  actions other than mere _courting_. Sadism would then correspond to an  aggressive component of the sexual impulse which has become independent  and exaggerated and has been brought to the foreground by displacement.    The conception of sadism fluctuates in the usage of language from a mere  active or impetuous attitude towards the sexual object to the exclusive  attachment of the gratification to the subjection and maltreatment of  the object. Strictly speaking only the last extreme case has a claim to  the name of perversion.    Similarly, the designation of masochism comprises all passive attitude  to the sexual life and to the sexual object; in its most extreme form  the gratification is connected with suffering of physical or mental pain  at the hands of the sexual object. Masochism as a perversion seems to be  still more remote from the normal sexual life by forming a contrast to  it; it may be doubted whether it ever appears as a primary form or  whether it does not more regularly originate through transformation from  sadism. It can often be recognized that the masochism is nothing but a  continuation of the sadism turning against one's own person in which the  latter at first takes the place of the sexual object. Analysis of  extreme cases of masochistic perversions show that there is a  cooeperation of a large series of factors which exaggerate and fix the  original passive sexual attitude (castration complex, conscience).    The pain which is here overcome ranks with the loathing and shame which  were the resistances opposed to the libido.    Sadism and masochism occupy a special place among the perversions, for  the contrast of activity and passivity lying at their bases belong to  the common traits of the sexual life.    That cruelty and sexual impulse are most intimately connected is beyond  doubt taught by the history of civilization, but in the explanation of  this connection no one has gone beyond the accentuation of the  aggressive factors of the libido. The aggression which is mixed with the  sexual impulse is according to some authors a remnant of cannibalistic  lust, a participation on the part of the domination apparatus  (Bemaechtigungsapparatus), which served also for the gratification of the  great wants of the other, ontogenetically the older impulse.[21] It has  also been claimed that every pain contains in itself the possibility of  a pleasurable sensation. Let us be satisfied with the impression that  the explanation of this perversion is by no means satisfactory and that  it is possible that many psychic efforts unite themselves into one  effect.    The most striking peculiarity of this perversion lies in the fact that  its active and passive forms are regularly encountered together in the  same person. He who experiences pleasure by causing pain to others in  sexual relations is also able to experience the pain emanating from  sexual relations as pleasure. A sadist is simultaneously a masochist,  though either the active or the passive side of the perversion may be  more strongly developed and thus represent his preponderate sexual  activity.[22]    We thus see that certain perverted propensities regularly appear in  _contrasting pairs_, a thing which, in view of the material to be  produced later, must claim great theoretical value. It is furthermore  clear that the existence of the contrast, sadism and masochism, can not  readily be attributed to the mixture of aggression. On the other hand  one may be tempted to connect such simultaneously existing contrasts  with the united contrast of male and female in bisexuality, the  significance of which is reduced in psychoanalysis to the contrast of  activity and passivity.      3. GENERAL STATEMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL PERVERSIONS    *Variation and Disease.*--The physicians who at first studied the  _perversions_ in pronounced cases and under peculiar conditions were  naturally inclined to attribute to them the character of a morbid or  degenerative sign similar to the _inversions_. This view, however, is  easier to refute in this than in the former case. Everyday experience  has shown that most of these transgressions, at least the milder ones,  are seldom wanting as components in the sexual life of normals who look  upon them as upon other intimacies. Wherever the conditions are  favorable such a perversion may for a long time be substituted by a  normal person for the normal sexual aim or it may be placed near it. In  no normal person does the normal sexual aim lack some designable  perverse element, and this universality suffices in itself to prove the  inexpediency of an opprobrious application of the name perversion. In  the realm of the sexual life one is sure to meet with exceptional  difficulties which are at present really unsolvable, if one wishes to  draw a sharp line between the mere variations within physiological  limits and morbid symptoms.    Nevertheless, the quality of the new sexual aim in some of these  perversions is such as to require special notice. Some of the  perversions are in content so distant from the normal that we cannot  help calling them \"morbid,\" especially those in which the sexual  impulse, in overcoming the resistances (shame, loathing, fear, and pain)  has brought about surprising results (licking of feces and violation of  cadavers). Yet even in these cases one ought not to feel certain of  regularly finding among the perpetrators persons of pronounced  abnormalities or insane minds. We can not lose sight of the fact that  persons who otherwise behave normally are recorded as sick in the realm  of the sexual life where they are dominated by the most unbridled of all  impulses. On the other hand, a manifest abnormality in any other  relation in life generally shows an undercurrent of abnormal sexual  behavior.    In the majority of cases we are able to find the morbid character of the  perversion not in the content of the new sexual aim but in its relation  to the normal. It is morbid if the perversion does not appear beside the  normal (sexual aim and sexual object), where favorable circumstances  promote it and unfavorable impede the normal, or if it has under all  circumstances repressed and supplanted the normal; _the exclusiveness_  and _fixation_ of the perversion justifies us in considering it a morbid  symptom.    *The Psychic Participation in the Perversions.*--Perhaps it is precisely  in the most abominable perversions that we must recognize the most  prolific psychic participation for the transformation of the sexual  impulse. In these cases a piece of psychic work has been accomplished in  which, in spite of its gruesome success, the value of an idealization of  the impulse can not be disputed. The omnipotence of love nowhere perhaps  shows itself stronger than in this one of her aberrations. The highest  and the lowest everywhere in sexuality hang most intimately together.  (\"From heaven through the world to hell.\")    *Two Results.*--In the study of perversions we have gained an insight  into the fact that the sexual impulse has to struggle against certain  psychic forces, resistances, among which shame and loathing are most  prominent. We may presume that these forces are employed to confine the  impulse within the accepted normal limits, and if they have become  developed in the individual before the sexual impulse has attained its  full strength, it is really they which have directed it in the course of  development.[23]    We have furthermore remarked that some of the examined perversions can  be comprehended only by assuming the union of many motives. If they are  amenable to analysis--disintegration--they must be of a composite  nature. This may give us a hint that the sexual impulse itself may not  be something simple, that it may on the contrary be composed of many  components which detach themselves to form perversions. Our clinical  observation thus calls our attention to _fusions_ which have lost their  expression in the uniform normal behavior.      4. THE SEXUAL IMPULSE IN NEUROTICS    *Psychoanalysis.*--A proper contribution to the knowledge of the sexual  impulse in persons who are at least related to the normal can be gained  only from one source, and is accessible only by one definite path. There  is only one way to obtain a thorough and unerring solution of problems  in the sexual life of so-called psychoneurotics (hysteria, obsessions,  the wrongly-named neurasthenia, and surely also dementia praecox, and  paranoia), and that is by subjecting them to the psychoanalytic  investigations propounded by J. Breuer and myself in 1893, which we  called the \"cathartic\" treatment.    I must repeat what I have said in my published work, that these  psychoneuroses, as far as my experience goes, are based on sexual motive  powers. I do not mean that the energy of the sexual impulse merely  contributes to the forces supporting the morbid manifestations  (symptoms), but I wish distinctly to maintain that this supplies the  only constant and the most important source of"]]]
