Where the road for carts wound into the  gravel-pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside, and a  great bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and  smooth between the tall sides of the gravel-pit. And all the gleaming  heaps was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these countless  coins the mid-day sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed till  the quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the  fairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.    The children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word.    At last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the  edge of the heap by the cart-road, and looked at it. He looked on both  sides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own, \"It's  not sovereigns.\"    \"It's gold, anyway,\" said Cyril. And now they all began to talk at once.  They all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run  through their fingers like water, and the chink it made as it fell was  wonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of spending the  money, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two heaps of  the gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in sand  when you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with  his newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she  cried out, \"Oh stop, it's too heavy! It hurts!\"    Robert said \"Bosh!\" and went on.    \"Let me out, I tell you,\" cried Jane, and was taken out, very white, and  trembling a little.    \"You've no idea what it's like,\" said she; \"it's like stones on you--or  like chains.\"    \"Look here,\" Cyril said, \"if this is to do us any good, it's no good our  staying gasping at it like this. Let's fill our pockets and go and buy  things. Don't you forget, it won't last after sunset. I wish we'd asked  the Sammyadd why things don't turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I'll  tell you what, there's a pony and cart in the village.\"    \"Do you want to buy that?\" asked Jane.    \"No, silly,--we'll _hire_ it. And then we'll go to Rochester and buy  heaps and heaps of things. Look here, let's each take as much as we can  carry. But it's not sovereigns. They've got a man's head on one side and  a thing like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it,  I tell you, and come along. You can talk as we go--if you _must_ talk.\"    Cyril sat down and began to fill his pockets.    \"You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my suit,\"  said he, \"but now you see!\"    They did. For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his  handkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the  gold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and had to sit down  again in a hurry.    \"Throw out some of the cargo,\" said Robert. \"You'll sink the ship, old  chap. That comes of nine pockets.\"    And Cyril had to do so.    Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and  the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and  hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.    It was Jane who said, \"I don't see how we're to spend it all. There must  be thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I'm going to leave some of  mine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we get to the village  we'll buy some biscuits; I know it's long past dinner-time.\" She took  out a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old  hornbeam. \"How round and yellow they are,\" she said. \"Don't you wish  they were made of gingerbread and we were going to eat them?\"    \"Well, they're not, and we're not,\" said Cyril. \"Come on!\"    But they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village,  more than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden  treasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas  in their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked  quite ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have  more than a half-crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue  of the wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of  the village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench to which they  came. It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.    [Illustration: He staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry]    It was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for  ginger-beer, because, as Anthea said, \"It was not wrong for men to go  into beer-saloons, only for children. And Cyril is nearer being a man  than us, because he is the eldest.\" So he went. The others sat in the  sun and waited.    \"Oh, how hot it is!\" said Robert. \"Dogs put their tongues out when  they're hot; I wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?\"    \"We might try,\" Jane said; and they all put their tongues out as far as  ever they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats, but it  only seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying everyone  who went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril came  back with ginger-beer.    \"I had to pay for it out of my own money, though, that I was going to  buy rabbits with,\" he said. \"They wouldn't change the gold. And when I  pulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was card-counters.  And I got some sponge-cakes too, out of a glass jar on the bar-counter.  And some biscuits with caraways in.\"    The sponge-cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry too,  and yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the ginger-beer made  up for everything.    \"It's my turn now to try to buy something with the money,\" Anthea said;  \"I'm next eldest. Where is the pony-cart kept?\"    It was at The Chequers, and Anthea went in the back way to the yard,  because they all knew that little girls ought not to go into the bars of  beer-saloons. She came out, as she herself said, \"pleased but not  proud.\"    \"He'll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says,\" she remarked, \"and he's  to have one sovereign--or whatever it is--to drive us into Rochester and  back, besides waiting there till we've got everything we want. I think I  managed very well.\"    \"You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay,\" said Cyril moodily. \"How  did you do it?\"    \"I wasn't jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money out of my  pocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway,\" she retorted. \"I just found a  young man doing something to a horse's legs with a sponge and a pail.  And I held out one sovereign, and I said--'Do you know what this is?' He  said 'No,' and he'd call his father. And the old man came, and he said  it was a spade guinea; and he said was it my own to do as I liked with,  and I said 'Yes'; and I asked about the pony-cart, and I said he could  have the guinea if he'd drive us into Rochester. And his name is S.  Crispin. And he said, 'Right oh.'\"    It was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony-trap along pretty  country roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the case  with new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending  the money which each child made as they went along, silently of course  and quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the  old innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way in which they  were thinking. The old man put them down by the bridge at their request.    \"If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you go?\"  asked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something to say.    \"Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen's Head,\" said the old man promptly.  \"Though all forbid I should recommend any man where it's a question of  horses, no more than I'd take anybody else's recommending if I was  a-buying one. But if your pa's thinking of a rig of any sort, there  ain't a straighter man in Rochester, nor civiller spoken, than Billy,  though I says it.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Cyril. \"The Saracen's Head.\"    And now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside  down and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown-up person would  tell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy  money had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was  almost impossible. The trades-people of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a  trades-person, from the glittering fairy gold (\"furrin money\" they  called it, for the most part).    To begin with, Anthea, who had had the misfortune to sit on her hat  earlier in the day, wished to buy another. She chose a very beautiful  one, trimmed with pink roses and the blue breasts of peacocks. It was  marked in the window, \"Paris Model, three guineas.\"    \"I'm glad,\" she said, \"because it says guineas, and not sovereigns,  which we haven't got.\"    But when she took three of the spade guineas in her hand, which was by  this time rather dirty owing to her not having put on gloves before  going to the gravel-pit, the black-silk young lady in the shop looked  very hard at her, and went and whispered something to an older and  uglier lady, also in black silk, and then they gave her back the money  and said it was not current coin.    \"It's good money,\" said Anthea, \"and it's my own.\"    \"I daresay,\" said the lady, \"but it's not the kind of money that's  fashionable now, and we don't care about taking it.\"    \"I believe they think we've stolen it,\" said Anthea, rejoining the  others in the street; \"if we had gloves they wouldn't think we were so  dishonest. It's my hands being so dirty fills their minds with doubts.\"    So they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the  kind at a shilling, but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at  it through her spectacles and said she had no change; so the gloves had  to be paid for out of Cyril's money with which he meant to buy rabbits  and so had the green imitation crocodile-skin purse at nine-pence which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17321"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent (#6)"],[1,"  According to this view, the whole primitive Neolithic population of  North and South was Miotic, indigenous in origin, and akin to the  \"Mediterraneans \"of Prof. Sergi and the other ethnologists. It was not  this population, the stone-users whose necropoles have been found by  Messrs. de Morgan, Petrie, and Maclver, that entered the Nile valley by  the Wadi Hammamat. This was another race of different ethnic origin,  which came from the Red Sea toward the end of the Neolithic period,  and, being of higher civilization than the native Nilotes, assumed the  lordship over them, gave a great impetus to the development of their  culture, and started at once the institution of monarchy, the knowledge  of letters, and the use of metals. The chiefs of this superior tribe  founded the monarchy, conquered the North, unified the kingdom, and  began Egyptian history. From many indications it would seem probable  that these conquerors were of Babylonian origin, or that the culture  they brought with them (possibly from Arabia) was ultimately of  Babylonian origin. They themselves would seem to have been Semites,  or rather proto-Semites, who came from Arabia to Africa by way of  the straits of Bab el-Mandeb, and proceeded up the coast to about the  neighbourhood of Kuser, whence the Wadi Hammamat offered them an open  road to the valley of the Nile. By this route they may have entered  Egypt, bringing with them a civilization, which, like that of the other  Semites, had been profoundly influenced and modified by that of the  Sumerian inhabitants of Babylonia. This Semitic-Sumerian culture,  mingling with that of the Nilotes themselves, produced the civilization  of Ancient Egypt as we know it.    This is a very plausible hypothesis, and has a great deal of evidence in  its favour. It seems certain that in the early dynastic period two  races lived in Egypt, which differed considerably in type, and also,  apparently, in burial customs. The later Egyptians always buried the  dead lying on their backs, extended at full length. During the period of  the Middle Kingdom (XIth-XIIIth Dynasties) the head was usually turned  over on to the left side, in order that the dead man might look through  the two great eyes painted on that side of the coffin. Afterward the  rigidly extended position was always adopted. The Neolithic Egyptians,  however, buried the dead lying wholly on the left side and in a  contracted position, with the knees drawn up to the chin. The bodies  were not embalmed, and the extended position and mummification were  never used. Under the IVth Dynasty we find in the necropolis of Medum  (north of the Payyum) the two positions used simultaneously, and the  extended bodies are mummified. The contracted bodies are skeletons, as  in the case of most of the predynastic bodies. When these are found with  flesh, skin, and hair intact, their preservation is due to the dryness  of the soil and the preservative salts it contains, not to intentional  embalming, which was evidently introduced by those who employed the  extended position in burial. The contracted position is found as late as  the Vth Dynasty at Dashasha, south of the Eayyum, but after that date it  is no longer found.    The conclusion is obvious that the contracted position without  mummification, which the Neolithic people used, was supplanted in the  early dynastic period by the extended position with mummification, and  by the time of the VIth Dynasty it was entirely superseded. This points  to the supersession of the burial customs of the indigenous Neolithic  race by those of another race which conquered and dominated the  indigenes. And, since the extended burials of the IVth Dynasty are  evidently those of the higher nobles, while the contracted ones are  those of inferior people, it is probable that the customs of extended  burial and embalming were introduced by a foreign race which founded the  Egyptian monarchical state, with its hierarchy of nobles and officials,  and in fact started Egyptian civilization on its way. The conquerors of  the North were thus not the descendants of the Neolithic people of the  South, but their conquerors; in fact, they dominated the indigenes both  of North and South, who will then appear (since we find the custom of  contracted burial in the North at Dashasha and Medum) to have originally  belonged to the same race.    The conquering race is that which is supposed to have been of Semitic or  proto-Semitic origin, and to have brought elements of Sumerian culture  to savage Egypt. The reasons advanced for this supposition are the  following:--    (1) Just as the Egyptian race was evidently compounded of two elements,  of conquered \"Mediterraneans\" and conquering x, so the Egyptian language  is evidently compounded of two elements, the one Nilotic, perhaps  related in some degree to the Berber dialects of North Africa, the other  not x, but evidently Semitic.    (2) Certain elements of the early dynastic civilization, which do not  appear in that of the earlier pre-dynastic period, resemble well-known  elements of the civilization of Babylonia. We may instance the use of  the cylinder-seal, which died out in Egypt in the time of the XVIIIth  Dynasty, but was always used in Babylonia from the earliest to the  latest times. The early Egyptian mace-head is of exactly the same  type as the early Babylonian one. In the British Museum is an Egyptian  mace-head of red breccia, which is identical in shape and size with  one from Babylonia (also in the museum) bearing the name of  Shargani-shar-ali (i.e. Sargon, King of Agade), one of the earliest  Chaldaean monarchs, who must have lived about the same time as the  Egyptian kings of the IId-IIId Dynasties, to which period the Egyptian  mace-head may also be approximately assigned. The Egyptian art of the  earliest dynasties bears again a remarkable resemblance to that of early  Babylonia. It is not till the time of the IId Dynasty that Egyptian art  begins to take upon itself the regular form which we know so well, and  not till that of the IVth that this form was finally crystallized. Under  the 1st Dynasty we find the figure of man or, to take other instances,  that of a lion, or a hawk, or a snake, often treated in a style very  different from that in which we are accustomed to see a man, a lion, a  hawk, or a snake depicted in works of the later period. And the striking  thing is that these early representations, which differ so much from  what we find in later Egyptian art, curiously resemble the works of  early Babylonian art, of the time of the patesis of Shirpurla or the  Kings Shargani-shar-ali and Naram-Sin. One of the best known relics  of the early art of Babylonia is the famous \"Stele of Vultures\" now in  Paris. On this we see the enemies of Eannadu, one of the early rulers  of Shirpurla, cast out to be devoured by the vultures. On an Egyptian  relief of slate, evidently originally dedicated in a temple record of  some historical event, and dating from the beginning of the Ist Dynasty  (practically contemporary, according to our latest knowledge, with  Eannadu), we have an almost exactly similar scene of captives being cast  out into the desert, and devoured by lions and vultures. The two reliefs  are curiously alike in their clumsy, naive style of art. A further  point is that the official represented on the stele, who appears to be  thrusting one of the bound captives out to die, wears a long fringed  garment of Babylonish cut, quite different from the clothes of the later  Egyptians.    (3) There are evidently two distinct and different main strata in the  fabric of Egyptian religion. On the one hand we find a mass of myth and  religious belief of very primitive, almost savage, cast, combining  a worship of the actual dead in their tombs--which were supposed  to communicate and thus form a veritable \"underworld,\" or, rather,  \"under-Egypt\"--with veneration of magic animals, such as jackals, cats,  hawks, and crocodiles. On the other hand, we have a sun and sky worship  of a more elevated nature, which does not seem to have amalgamated with  the earlier fetishism and corpse-worship until a comparatively late  period. The main seats of the sun-worship were at Heliopolis in the  Delta and at Edfu in Upper Egypt. Heliopolis seems always to have been  a centre of light and leading in Egypt, and it is, as is well known,  the On of the Bible, at whose university the Jewish lawgiver Moses is  related to have been educated \"in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.\" The  philosophical theories of the priests of the Sun-gods, Ra-Harmachis and  Turn, at Heliopolis seem to have been the source from which sprang the  monotheistic heresy of the Disk-Worshippers (in the time of the XVIIIth  Dynasty), who, under the guidance of the reforming King Akhunaten,  worshipped only the disk of the sun as the source of all life, the door  in heaven, so to speak, through which the hidden One Deity poured  forth heat and light, the origin of life upon the earth. Very early  in Egyptian history the Heliopolitans gained the upper hand, and the  Ra-worship (under the Vth Dynasty, the apogee of the Old Kingdom) came  to the front, and for the first time the kings took the afterwards  time-honoured royal title of \"Son of the Sun.\" It appears then as a  more or less foreign importation into the Nile valley, and bears most  undoubtedly a Semitic impress. Its two chief seats were situated, the  one, Heliopolis, in the North on the eastern edge of the Delta,--just  where an early Semitic settlement from over the desert might be expected  to be found,--the other, Edfu, in the Upper Egyptian territory south  of the Thebaid, Koptos, and the Wadi Ham-mamat, and close to the chief  settlement of the earliest kings and the most ancient capital of Upper  Egypt.
