Of the Blue Licks in Kentucky, Mr. John Filson thus wrote, in 1784: \"The  amazing herds of buffaloes which resort thither, by their size and  number, fill the traveller with amazement and terror, especially when  he beholds the prodigious roads they have made from all quarters, as if  leading to some populous city; the vast space of land around these  springs desolated as if by a ravaging enemy, and hills reduced to  plains; for the land near these springs is chiefly hilly. * * * I have  heard a hunter assert he saw above one thousand buffaloes at the Blue  Licks at once; so numerous were they before the first settlers had  wantonly sported away their lives.\" Col. Daniel Boone declared of the  Red River region in Kentucky, \"The buffaloes were more frequent than I  have seen cattle in the settlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane,  or cropping the herbage of those extensive plains, fearless because  ignorant of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove,  and the numbers about the salt springs were amazing.\"    According to Ramsey, where Nashville now stands, in 1770 there were  \"immense numbers of buffalo and other wild game. The country was crowded  with them. Their bellowings sounded from the hills and forest.\" Daniel  Boone found vast herds of buffalo grazing in the valleys of East  Tennessee, between the spurs of the Cumberland mountains.    Marquette declared that the prairies along the Illinois River were  \"covered with buffaloes.\" Father Hennepin, in writing of northern  Illinois, between Chicago and the Illinois River, asserted that \"there  must be an innumerable quantity of wild bulls in that country, since the  earth is covered with their horns. * * * They follow one another, so  that you may see a drove of them for above a league together. * * *  Their ways are as beaten as our great roads, and no herb grows therein.\"    Judged by ordinary standards of comparison, the early pioneers of the  last century thought buffalo were abundant in the localities mentioned  above. But the herds which lived east of the Mississippi were  comparatively only mere stragglers from the innumerable mass which  covered the great western pasture region from the Mississippi to the  Rocky Mountains, and from the Rio Grande to Great Slave Lake. The town  of Kearney, in south central Nebraska, may fairly be considered the  geographical center of distribution of the species, as it originally  existed, but ever since 1800, and until a few years ago, the center of  population has been in the Black Hills of southwestern Dakota.    Between the Rocky Mountains and the States lying along the Mississippi  River on the west, from Minnesota to Louisiana, the whole country was  one vast buffalo range, inhabited by millions of buffaloes. One could  fill a volume with the records of plainsmen and pioneers who penetrated  or crossed that vast region between 1800 and 1870, and were in turn  surprised, astounded, and frequently dismayed by the tens of thousands  of buffaloes they observed, avoided, or escaped from. They lived and  moved as no other quadrupeds ever have, in great multitudes, like grand  armies in review, covering scores of square miles at once. They were so  numerous they frequently stopped boats in the rivers, threatened to  overwhelm travelers on the plains, and in later years derailed  locomotives and cars, until railway engineers learned by experience the  wisdom of stopping their trains whenever there were buffaloes crossing  the track. On this feature of the buffalo's life history a few detailed  observations may be of value.    Near the mouth of the White River, in southwestern Dakota, Lewis and  Clark saw (in 1806) a herd of buffalo which caused them to make the  following record in their journal:    \"These last animals [buffaloes] are now so numerous that from an  eminence we discovered more than we had ever seen before at one time;  and if it be not impossible to calculate the moving multitude, which  darkened the whole plains, we are convinced that twenty thousand would  be no exaggerated number.\"    When near the mouth of the Yellowstone, on their way down the Missouri,  a previous record had been made of a meeting with other herds:    \"The buffalo now appear in vast numbers. A herd happened to be on their  way across the river [the Missouri]. Such was the multitude of these  animals that although the river, including an island over which they  passed, was a mile in length, the herd stretched as thick as they could  swim completely from one side to the other, and the party was obliged to  stop for an hour. They consoled themselves for the delay by killing four  of the herd, and then proceeded till at the distance of 45 miles they  halted on an island, below which two other herds of buffalo, as numerous  as the first, soon after crossed the river.\"[22]    [Note 22: Lewis and Clark's Exped., II, p. 395.]    Perhaps the most vivid picture ever afforded of the former abundance of  buffalo is that given by Col. R. I. Dodge in his \"Plains of the Great  West,\" p. 120, _et seq._ It is well worth reproducing entire:    \"In May, 1871, I drove in a light wagon from Old Fort Zara to Fort  Larned, on the Arkansas, 34 miles. At least 25 miles of this distance  was through one immense herd, composed of countless smaller herds of  buffalo then on their journey north. The road ran along the broad level  'bottom,' or valley, of the river. * * *    \"The whole country appeared one great mass of buffalo, moving slowly to  the northward; and it was only when actually among them that it could be  ascertained that the apparently solid mass was an agglomeration of  innumerable small herds, of from fifty to two hundred animals, separated  from the surrounding herds by greater or less space, but still  separated. The herds in the valley sullenly got out of my way, and,  turning, stared stupidly at me, sometimes at only a few yards' distance.  When I had reached a point where the hills were no longer more than a  mile from the road, the buffalo on the hills, seeing an unusual object  in their rear, turned, stared an instant, then started at full speed  directly towards me, stampeding and bringing with them the numberless  herds through which they passed, and pouring down upon me all the herds,  no longer separated, but one immense compact mass of plunging animals,  mad with fright, and as irresistible as an avalanche.    \"The situation was by no means pleasant. Reining up my horse (which was  fortunately a quiet old beast that had been in at the death of many a  buffalo, so that their wildest, maddest rush only caused him to cock his  ears in wonder at their unnecessary excitement), I waited until the  front of the mass was within 50 yards, when a few well-directed shots  from my rifle split the herd, and sent it pouring off in two streams to  my right and left. When all had passed me they stopped, apparently  perfectly satisfied, though thousands were yet within reach of my rifle  and many within less than 100 yards. Disdaining to fire again, I sent my  servant to cut out the tongues of the fallen. This occurred so  frequently within the next 10 miles, that when I arrived at Fort Larned  I had twenty-six tongues in my wagon, representing the greatest number  of buffalo that my conscience can reproach me for having murdered on any  single day. I was not hunting, wanted no meat, and would not voluntarily  have fired at these herds. I killed only in self-preservation and fired  almost every shot from the wagon.\"    At my request Colonel Dodge has kindly furnished me a careful estimate  upon which to base a calculation of the number of buffaloes in that  great herd, and the result is very interesting. In a private letter,  dated September 21, 1887, he writes as follows:    \"The great herd on the Arkansas through which I passed could not have  averaged, _at rest_, over fifteen or twenty individuals to the acre, but  was, from my own observation, not less than 25 miles wide, and from  reports of hunters and others it was about five days in passing a given  point, or not less than 50 miles deep. From the top of Pawnee Rock I  could see from 6 to 10 miles in almost every direction. This whole vast  space was covered with buffalo, looking at a distance like one compact  mass, the visual angle not permitting the ground to be seen. I have seen  such a sight a great number of times, but never on so large a scale.    \"That was the last of the great herds.\"    With these figures before us, it is not difficult to make a calculation  that will be somewhere near the truth of the number of buffaloes  actually seen in one day by Colonel Dodge on the Arkansas River during  that memorable drive, and also of the number of head in the entire herd.    According to his recorded observation, the herd extended along the river  for a distance of 25 miles, which was in reality the width of the vast  procession that was moving north, and back from the road as far as the  eye could reach, on both sides. It is making a low estimate to consider  the extent of the visible ground at 1 mile on either side. This gives a  strip of country 2 miles wide by 25 long, or a total of 50 square miles  covered with buffalo, averaging from fifteen to twenty to the acre.[23]  Taking the lesser number, in order to be below the truth rather than  above it, we find that the number actually seen on that day by Colonel  Dodge was in the neighborhood of 480,000, not counting the additional  number taken in at the view from the top of Pawnee Rock, which, if  added, would easily bring the total up to a round half million!    [Note 23: On the plains of Dakota, the Rev. Mr. Belcourt (Schoolcraft's  N. A. Indians, IV, p. 108) once counted two hundred and twenty-eight  buffaloes, a part of a great herd, feeding on a single acre of ground.

The picture of the Brahmins, drawn by Apuleius in the second century,  shows how little they have changed in historical times. He says:--    \"The Indians are a populous nation of vast extent of territory, situated  far from us to the east, near the reflux of the ocean and the rising of  the sun, under the first beams of the stars, and at the extreme verge of  the earth, beyond the learned Egyptians and the superstitious Jews and  the mercantile Nabathaeans; and the flowing robed Aracidae, and the  Ityraeans, poor in crops, and the Arabians, rich in perfumes.    \"Now, I do not so much admire the heaps of ivory of the Indians, their  harvests of pepper, their bales of cinnamon, their tempered steel, their  mines of silver, and their golden streams, nor that among them, the  Ganges, the greatest of all rivers,      'Rolls like a monarch on his course, and pours    His eastern waters through a hundred streams,    Mingling with ocean by a hundred mouths,'    \"nor that these Indians, though situated at the dawn of day, are yet of  the colour of night, nor that among them, immense dragons fight with  enormous elephants, with parity of danger to their mutual destruction,  for they hold them enwrapped in their slippery folds, so that the  elephants cannot disengage their legs or in any way extricate themselves  from the scaly bonds of the tenacious dragons. They are forced to seek  revenge from the fall of their own bulk and to crush their captors by  the mass of their own bodies.    \"There are amongst them various kinds of inhabitants. I will rather  speak of the marvellous things of men than of those of nature.    \"There is among them a race who know nothing but to tend cattle, hence  they are called neatherds; there are races clever in trafficking with  merchandise, and others stout in fight, whether with arrows, or hand to  hand with swords.    \"There is also among them a pre-eminent race called Gymnosophists.    \"These I exceedingly admire, for they are men skilled not in propagating  the vine, nor in grafting trees, nor in tilling the ground. They know  not how to cultivate the fields, nor to wash gold, or to break horses,  or to shear or feed sheep or goats.    \"What is it, then, they know? One thing instead of all these. They  _cultivate wisdom_, both the aged professors and the young students.  Nothing do I so much admire in them as that they hate torpor of mind and  sloth.\"    This does not look as if the Indians had been unknown or unappreciated  in the second century A.D.    Apuleius is not alone in his respect for the Brahmins. Many of the Greek  writers speak of them under the names of Brahmins or Gymnosophists, but  always with great respect.    Strabo states, on the authority of Megasthenes (who it will be  remembered was Ambassador from Persia, and lived for some years at  Palibothra, about 307 B.C.), that \"there were two classes of  philosophers or priests, the Brachmanes and the Germanes, but the  Brachmanes are best esteemed.\" Towards the close of his account of the  \"Brachmanes\" he says:--    \"In many things they agree with the Greeks, for they affirm that the  world was produced, and is perishable, and that it is spherical; that  God, governing it as well as framing it, pervades the whole; that the  principles of all things are various, but water is the principle of the  construction of the world; that besides the four elements there is a  fifth, nature--whence heaven and the stars; that the earth is placed in  the centre of all.    \"Such, and many other things are affirmed of reproduction and of the  soul. Like Plato, they devise fables concerning the immortality of the  soul, and the judgment in the infernal regions, and other similar  notions. These things are said of the Brachmanes.\"    Clemens Alexandrinus, after saying that philosophy flourished in ancient  times amongst the barbarians, and afterwards was introduced amongst the  Greeks, instances the prophets of the Egyptians, the Chaldees of the  Assyrians, the Druids of the Gauls (Galatae), the Samauaeans of the  Bactrians, the philosophers of the Celts, the Magi of the Persians, and  the Gymnosophists of the Indians. The Greek authors distinctly speak of  the Brahmins as the chief of the castes or divisions of the Indian  people from the time of Megasthenes, who wrote of them in the fourth  century B.C.    Sir William Jones, in a paper on the philosophy of the Asiatics, pointed  out that \"the old philosophers of Europe had some idea of centripetal  force, and a principle of universal gravitation,\" and affirms that \"much  of the theology and philosophy of our immortal Newton may be found in  the Vedas.\"    \"That _most subtle spirit_ which he suspected to pervade natural bodies,  and lying concealed in them, to cause attraction and repulsion, the  emission, reflection and refraction of light, electricity, calefaction,  sensation, and muscular motion, is described by the Hindus as a _fifth  element_, endowed with these very powers; and the Vedas abound with  allusions to a force universally attractive, which they chiefly ascribe  to the sun, thence called 'Aditya, or the attractor,' a name designed by  the mythologists to mean the child of the goddess Aditi. But the most  wonderful passage on the theory of attractions occurs in the charming  allegorical poem of 'Shi'ri'n and Ferhai'd, or the Divine Spirit, and a  human soul disinterestedly pious,' a work which, from the first verse to  the last, is a blaze of religious and poetical fire.    \"The whole passage appears to me so curious that I make no apology for  giving you a faithful translation of it:--    \"_There is a strong propensity which dances through every atom, and  attracts the minutest particle to some peculiar object; search this  universe from its base to its summit, from fire to air, from water to  earth (the four elements!), from all below the moon to all above the  celestial spheres, and thou wilt not find a corpuscle destitute of that  natural attractability. The very point of the first thread in this  apparently tangled skein is no other than such a principle of  attraction, and all principles beside are void of a real basis: from  such a propensity arises every motion perceived in heavenly or in  terrestrial bodies; it is a disposition to be attracted which taught  hard steel to rush from its place and rivet itself on the magnet; it is  the same disposition which impels the light straw to attach itself  firmly on amber; it is this quality which gives every substance in  nature a tendency towards another, and an inclination forcibly directed  to a determinate point._\"    In Sir W. Ainslie's Materia Medica of India the opinion of an old Hindoo  author is given as to the qualifications required in a physician.    \"He must be a person of strict veracity, and of the greatest sobriety  and decorum: he ought to be skilled in all the commentaries on the  'Ayur-Veda,' and be otherwise a man of sense and benevolence: his heart  must be charitable, his temper calm, and his constant study how to do  good.    \"Such a man is properly called a good physician, and such a physician  ought still daily to improve his mind by an attentive perusal of  scientific books.       *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    \"Should death come upon us while under the care of a person of this  description, it can only be considered as inevitable fate, and not the  consequence of presumptuous ignorance.\"    The knowledge of the Hindoos may be all said to be contained in their  sacred books called the Vedas, which, although perfect as a whole, are  actually divided into four parts, each in itself constituting a separate  Veda under a special title. These are the Rig-Veda, the Yajur-Veda  (white and black), the Sama-Veda, and the Atharva-Veda, or Ayur-Veda.  Although the last is admitted to be as a whole not so ancient as the  other three, still there are portions of it that are probably as old as  any of the others. Even in the oldest epic poems of the Hindoos mention  is made of four Vedas as already in existence and as of great antiquity.  Sir William Jones estimates the date of its compilation as certainly not  after B.C. 1580.    These Vedas are considered by the Hindoos to contain the groundwork of  all their philosophy, as well as of their arts and sciences, and they  contain treatises on music, medicine, the art of war, and architecture.    Sir William Jones, in referring to the Ayur-Veda, says that, to his  astonishment, he found in it an entire Upanishad on the internal parts  of the human body, enumerating the nerves, veins, and arteries.    The Ayur-Veda was considered by the Brahmins to be the work of  Brahma--by him it was communicated to Dacsha, the Prajapati, and by him,  the two Aswins, or sons of Surya--the sun--were instructed in it, and  thus became the medical attendants of the gods. A legend that cannot but  recall to our mind the Greek myth of the two sons of AEsculapius and  their descent from Apollo.    In the case of immortal gods the practice was confined to surgery, in  treating the wounds received in the conflicts which were constantly  described as occurring amongst the gods themselves, or between the gods  and the demons. Of course they performed many miraculous cures, as would  be expected from their superhuman character.    Professor Wilson published in the _Oriental Magazine_, in 1823, some  notices on early Hindoo Medicine, and he points out that the tradition  is, that the above \"two Aswins instructed Indra in medical and surgical  art, that Indra instructed Dahnwantari; although others make Atreya,  Bharadwaja, and Charaka prior to the latter:--Charaka's work, which goes  by his name, is extant. Dahnwantari is also styled Kasi-rajah, or Prince  of Kasi, or Benares. His disciple was Susruta, his work also exists.\"    The Ayur-Veda, as the oldest medical writings of the Hindoos are  collectively called, was divided into"]]]
