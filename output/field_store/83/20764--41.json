The man fired as he advanced, and the noble Indian       again fell on his face: a few moments' struggle, and he lay a       stiffened corpse on the icy surface of the limpid waters.--The       woman for a moment seemed scarcely to notice the corpse; in a       few minutes, however, she showed a little emotion; but it was       not until obliged to leave the remains of her husband that she       gave way to grief, and vented her sorrow in the most       heart-breaking lamentations. While the scene which I have       described was acting, and which occurred in almost less space       than the description can be read, a number of Indians had       advanced within a shore distance, but seeing the untimely fate       of their chief, halted. Mr. ---- fired over their heads, and       they immediately fled. The banks of the lake, on the other       side, were at this time covered with men, women, and children,       at least several hundreds; but immediately being joined by       their companions all disappeared in the woods. We then had time       to think. For my own part I could scarcely credit my senses as       I beheld the remains of the noble fellow stretched on the ice,       crimsoned with his already frozen blood. One of the men then       went to the shore for some fir tree boughs to cover the body,       which measured as it lay, 6 feet 71/2 inches. The fellow who       first stabbed him wanted to strip off his cassock, (a garment       made of deer skin, lined with beaver and other skins, reaching       to the knees,) but met with so stern a rebuke from ----, that       he instantly desisted, and slunk abashed away.         After covering the body with boughs, we proceeded towards the       Indian houses--the woman often requiring force to take her       along. On examining them, we found no living creature, save a       bitch and her whelps about two months old. The houses of these       Indians are very different from those of the other tribes in       North America; they are built of straight pieces of fir about       twelve feet high, flattened at the sides, and driven in the       earth close to each other; the corners being much stronger than       the other parts.--The crevices are filled up with moss, and the       inside entirely lined with the same material; the roof is       raised so as to slant from all parts and meet in a point at the       centre, where a hole is left for the smoke to escape; the       remainder of the roof is covered with a treble coat of birch       bark, and between the first and second layer of bark is about       six inches of moss; about the chimney clay is substituted for       it. On entering one of the houses I was astonished at the       neatness which reigned within. The sides of the tenement were       covered with arms,--bows, arrows, clubs, axes of iron, (stolen       from the settlers) stone hatchets, arrow heads, in fact,       implements of war and for the chase, but all arranged in the       neatest order, and apparently every man's property carefully       put together. At one end was a small image, or rather a head,       carved rudely out of a block of wood; round the neck was hung       the case of a watch, and on a board close by, the works of the       watch, which had been carefully taken to pieces, and hung on       small pegs on the board; the whole were surrounded with the       main spring. In the other houses the remainder of the articles       stolen were found. Beams were placed across where the roof       began; over which smaller ones were laid: on these were piled a       considerable quantity of dried venison and salmon, together       with a little codfish. On ---- taking down the watch and works,       and bringing the image over the fire, the woman surveyed him       with anger, and in a few minutes made free with her tongue, her       manner showing us that she was not unused to scolding. When Mr.       ---- saw it displeased her, he, rather irreverently, threw the       log on one side: on this she rose in a rage, and would, had not       her hands been fastened, have inflicted summary vengeance for       the insult offered to the hideous idol. Wishing to pacify her,       he rose, and taking his _reverence_ carefully up, placed him       where he had taken him from. This pacified her. I must here do       the poor creature the justice to say, that I never afterwards       saw her out of temper. A watch was set outside; and having       partaken of the Indian's fare, we began to talk over the events       of the day. Both ---- and myself bitterly reproached the man       who first stabbed the unfortunate native; for though he acted       violently, still there was no necessity for the brutal       act--besides, the untaught Indian was only doing that which       every _man_ ought to do,--he came to rescue his wife from the       hands of her captors, and nobly lost his life in his attempt to       save her. ---- here declared that he would rather have       defeated the object of his Journey a hundred times than have       sacrificed the life of one Indian. The fellow merely replied,       \"it was only an Indian, and he wished he had shot a hundred       instead of one.\" The poor woman was now tied securely, we       having, on consideration, deemed it for the best to take her       with us, so that by kind treatment and civilization she might,       in the course of time, be returned to her tribe, and be the       means of effecting a lasting reconciliation between them and       the settlers.         After the men had laid themselves down around the fire, and the       watch was set outside, the door, Mr. ---- and myself remained       up; and, in a low voice, talked over the events of the day. We       then decided on remaining to rest three or four days; and, in       the meantime, to endeavour to find the Indians. I would I could       now describe how insensibly we glided from one subject to       another;--religion--politics--country--'home, _sweet, sweet_,       home'--alternately occupied our attention; and thus, in the       midst of a dreary waste, far away from the haunts of civilized       man, we sat contentedly smoking our pipes; and, Englishmen       like, settled the affairs of _nations_ over a glass of rum and       water--ever and anon drinking a health to each _friend_ and       _fair_, who rose uppermost in our thoughts. From this the       subject turned to \"specific gravity.\" Here an argument       commenced. When illustrating a position I had advanced, by the       ascension of the smoke from my pipe, we both turned up our eyes       to witness its progress upwards: on looking towards the       aperture in the roof what was our astonishment at beholding the       faces of _two Indians_, calmly surveying us in the quiet       occupation of _their_ abode. In an instant we shouted--\"The       Indians!\" and in a moment every one was on the alert, and each       taking his arms rushed to the door--not a creature was to be       seen; in vain we looked around;--no trace, save the marks of       footsteps on the snow, was to be discovered, but these seemed       almost innumerable. We fired about a dozen shots into the       woods, and then retired to our dwelling. ---- and I then       resolved to take alternate watch, and every half hour, at least       to walk round the house. During the night, however, we were not       again disturbed, save by the howling of wolves and barking of       foxes.                                                               E.S.      After the capture of Mary March, the next attempt, in order of time,  to discover the Red Indians was made by JAMES CORMACK, Esq., in 1822,  and for that purpose he crossed the whole interior of the  Island--starting from Random Bar on the Eastward on the 6th September,  and finding his way out at St. George's Bay, on the 2nd November  following. During this excursion he suffered great privation,--which  few men could have endured, and which few men indeed, would have  undertaken with only one companion. Mr. Cormack did not succeed in the  main object he had in view, yet was his trouble anything but  profitless. We now possess through his means a general knowledge of  the interior of our Island--together with a specific account of its  soil--its geological and mineralogical aspect--its varied natural  productions--of trees, shrubs, plants, flowers, &c., all named and  methodically described--the kind of animals met with, and a variety of  other useful information.    In the following year, 1823, and early in the spring of that year,  three females, a mother and two daughters, in Badger Bay, near  Exploits Bay, being in a starving condition, allowed themselves in  despair, to be quietly captured by some English furriers who  accidentally came upon them. Fortunately their miserable appearance,  when within gunshot, led to the unusual circumstance of their not  being fired at. The husband of the elder woman in attempting to avoid  the observation of the white men, tried to cross the creek upon the  ice, fell through and was drowned. About a month before this event,  and a few miles distant from the spot where this accident occurred,  the brother of this man and his daughter, belonging to the same  party, were shot by two English furriers. The man was first shot, and  the woman in despair remained calmly to be fired at, and incredible as  it may appear, this poor woman, far from her tribe--helpless--with her  back to her murderers,--excited in them no feeling of compassion--they  deliberately shot her,--the slugs passed through her body, and she  fell dead by the side of her father. The mind is slow to believe that  so brutal an act as this could have been committed, and is willing to  doubt the correctness of the report, but the proof of its accuracy is  the statement of one of the ruffians who perpetrated the foul act.
