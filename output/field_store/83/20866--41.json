But Jesus asks one  thing of us in return for all His kindness and care, and that one  thing is our love. Are we giving Him our love now? Are we asking Him  to lead us, and keep us safe from harm? May we seek to follow Him and  to know His voice.    [Illustration: THE SHEPHERD AND THE LAMBS.]          THE LOST PIECE OF MONEY.      Jesus had been preaching to a crowd of publicans and sinners. The  publicans of those days were the collectors of taxes for the Romans,  and it was a constant complaint against them that they exacted more  from the people than they had any right to do. So they were looked  upon as wicked men, although they were not all bad. Now the Scribes  and Pharisees, who made a great show of religion, so far as outward  forms went, were greatly shocked at seeing Christ sitting with  publicans, and said, \"This man receiveth sinners and eateth with  them.\"    Then Jesus asked them, \"What man of you, if he has a hundred sheep,  and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the  wilderness, and go after the lost one, until he has found it? And when  he has found it, he lays it upon his shoulders and takes it home,  rejoicing; and calls together his friends and neighbours, saying unto  them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'    \"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner  that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need  no repentance.    \"Again, what woman if she has ten pieces of money, and loses one, does  not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she  finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends  and neighbours, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece  of money which I had lost.'    \"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of God's  angels over one sinner that repenteth.\"    [Illustration: THE LOST PIECE OF MONEY.]          THE PRODIGAL SON.      A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his  father, \"Father, give me the portion of thy wealth that would fall to  me at thy death.\" He did so, and a few days after the younger son  gathered all his wealth together and journeyed into a far country.  There he met with evil companions, and wasted his money in riotous  living. When he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that  land, and he began to be in want of bread to eat. So he went and hired  himself to a man of that country, who sent him into the fields to feed  his pigs. And he was so hungry that he would have been glad to have  eaten the coarse food such as the swine eat; but no one gave it to  him.    His sufferings brought him to his senses, and he thought how foolish  he had been, for he remembered that his father's servants had food  enough and to spare, whilst his father's son was perishing with  hunger. He said, \"I will leave this land and go to my father and tell  him how I have sinned against heaven and him. I will tell him I am no  longer worthy to be called his son, and will implore him to make me  one of his hired servants.\" And he arose and went towards his father's  house, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him, and  was sorry for him, and ran and embraced him. Then he told his father  how he had sinned and had lost his title to be called the old man's  son, but the father was so glad to have his son come back repentant,  that he told his servants to bring the best clothing and a ring to put  on his son. And he made a great feast, and they were merry, for he  said, \"This is my son that was as one dead to me and is now alive  again; he was lost and is found.\"    [Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL.]    But the elder son was very angry, and would not go in to the feast,  but said to his father, \"Lo, these many years have I served thee, and  never offended or disobeyed thee, and thou hast never made a feast for  me and my friends; but now this thy other son has come back, that has  wasted thy wealth in riotous living, thou hast made a great feast for  him.\" And his father said, \"Son, thou art ever with me, and all I have  is thine. It is right that we should make merry and be glad, for this  thy brother was as one dead to us and is alive again; he was lost and  is found.\"           *       *       *       *       *          PETER'S WIFE'S MOTHER CURED.      After Jesus had left the Centurion He went to the house of his  disciple Peter, and there He saw Peter's wife's mother, laid on a bed,  sick with fever. And He took her by the hand and lifted her up. The  fever left her and she was cured. She rose up from her bed and  attended upon them.    That evening, when the sun was setting, they brought to Jesus all  those that were ill, and many that were possessed with devils. And He  cast out the devils by His word, and healed all those that were sick.           *       *       *       *       *        \"At even, ere the sun had set,      The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;      Oh, in what divers pains they met,      Oh, with what joy they went away!\"    [Illustration: PETER'S WIFE'S MOTHER.]          THE UNJUST STEWARD.          See where the steward, worldly wise,      With wicked cunning in his eyes,      Shows his lord's debtors how to cheat      His master of his oil and wheat.        \"A hundred measures dost thou owe      Of oil? My friend, 'tis scarcely so:      Here, take thy bill and quick indite      Fifty: that puts the matter right.\"        \"A hundred measures is _thy_ debt      Of corn? My friend, thou dost forget:      Here, take thy bill, and write fourscore;      Surely thou owest nothing more.\"        Thus wickedly he would provide      Houses in which he might abide,      When for his former acts unjust      He from his stewardship was thrust.        And when his master heard, he smiled,      Though of his goods he was beguiled:      Nor did he e'en forbear to praise      The crafty foresight of his ways.        The children of this world, alas!      The children of the light surpass,      In planning methods to provide      For ills from which they cannot hide.        And so our Master bids us take      The money which He gives, and make      Friends with our riches for the day      When earthly treasures flee away.        That when we leave our house below,      And into unknown regions go,      Through Jesus, we may find above      An everlasting home of love.        Do I my little store expend      For such a wise and prudent end;      Or only think of my own gain,      And not of others' want and pain?        Lord, by Thy Spirit, make me wise      Above my selfishness to rise,      And something daily give away      To find again in Thy great day!            RICHARD WILTON, M.A.    [Illustration: THE UNJUST STEWARD.]          THE RICH MAN AND THE BEGGAR.      There was a certain rich man who was clothed in rich silks and fine  linen, and feasted on costly food each day. There was also a poor  beggar, who was ragged and hungry, and covered with sores. His name  was Lazarus, and they laid him at the rich man's gate, for he desired  to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the well-supplied table. And  even the dogs had pity on him, for they came and licked his sores.    And it came to pass that the beggar died, and the angels carried him  away to heaven, where he was no longer clothed in rags, but in  glorious array. Neither was he hungry, for he sat with Abraham and  leaned upon his bosom.    The rich man also died, and was buried. He was not carried to heaven,  but went to a place of torment, where he lifted up his eyes, and in  the distance saw Abraham with Lazarus on his bosom. And he cried and  said, \"Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may  dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am  tormented in these flames.\" But Abraham said, \"Son, remember that thou  in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, whilst Lazarus had only  evil things; and now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. Beside  all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed.\"    Then said the rich man, \"I pray thee therefore, father, that thou  wouldest send him to my father's house; for I have five brethren. Let  him go to them and testify unto them, that they may repent, lest they  also come into this place of torment.\" Abraham said unto him, \"They  have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\" And he said, \"Nay,  father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will  repent.\" But Abraham said, \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets,  neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\"    [Illustration: THE RICH MAN AND THE BEGGAR.]          \"AVENGE ME OF MY ADVERSARY.\"      In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared  for man. And in the same city there was a widow that had an enemy, and  he had done her an injury. And she came to the judge and implored him,  saying, \"Give me justice; avenge me of my adversary.\" But he would  not. Then the widow came to him every day and cried, \"Give me  justice;\" but still he would not for a long while. At last he became  wearied of her constant cry, and he said within himself, \"Though I  fear not God nor care for man, yet, because this widow troubleth me  with her complaint, I will avenge her; lest by her continual coming  she weary me.\"    And Jesus said, \"Hear what the unjust judge saith. And if he, who was  an unjust judge and a wicked man, would grant the widow's petition,  because she asked so often, will not God, who is good and just, give  His children what is good and right for them?

The preliminary miseries of a great journey being at length over, I rose  early on the morning of the 30th of March and started from the Masheeah,  a kind of suburb of Tripoli, distant in the country, at six. Hope and  the spirit of adventure sustained my courage; but it is always sad to  part with those we love, even at the call of duty. However, I at length  mustered strength to bid adieu to my wife--the almost silent adieu of  affection. How many things that were thought were left unsaid on either  side! It will be pleasant to fill up all blanks when we talk of these  days after a safe return from this arduous undertaking.    It was a fresh, cheerful morning, succeeding several days of sultry  weather--an auspicious commencement of the journey. My chaouch, Mohammed  Souweea, preceded me on his great horse, murmuring some Arab ditty, and  I followed hard on my little donkey. The desert assails the walls of  Tripoli, and in half an hour we were in the Sahara sands, which here and  there rise in great mounds. I should have liked to have pushed on to  some considerable distance at once; but the habits of the country are  dilatory, and one must conform to them. In a couple of hours we came to  the chaouch's tent, where he had a wife, five children, and seven  brothers, one of whom was blind. He, too, was to go through the sad  ceremony of parting with his family; and he burst into tears when they  surrounded and embraced him. I am sorry to say, however, that before  this affecting scene was concluded, a quarrel had began between the  blind man and the chaouch's wife, about two Tunisian piastres which were  missing, she accusing him of theft and he indignantly repelling the  charge. These Easterns seem to have minds constructed on different  patterns from ours, and are apt to introduce such petty discussions at  the most solemn moments; but we must not, therefore, be hasty in  concluding that there is any sham in their sorrow, or affectation in  their pathetic bewailings.    They brought in a bowl of milk, and as the chaouch still continued to  caress his children, I left him to pass the night in his tent, and  pushed on to Wady Majeeneen, where my portion of the caravan had already  encamped. Mr. F. Warrington, with my German colleagues, were a little in  advance. The horses of the Pasha's cavalry were feeding around; for when  the first belt of sand is past, the country becomes an undulating  plain--a prairie, as they would call it in America--covered with patches  of corn herbage. Here and there are fields of barley; and a few Arab  tents, with flocks and herds near at hand, give a kind of animation to  the scene.    Next day (21st) it rained hard; but we went on a little to overtake Drs.  Barth and Overweg, whom we found in company with Mr. F. Warrington, Mr.  Vice-consul Reade, and Mr. Gaines the American consul. One of Mr.  Interpreter Moknee's wives had also come out here, to have some  settlement with her husband about support before she let him go. The  gentleman has two wives, both negresses; and had already made an  arrangement for the other, who has several children, of six mahboubs per  month. First come, first served. The second wife, who has two children,  only got three mahboubs a month. However, when matters were arranged,  the pair became rather more loving. These settlements are always hard  matters to manage, all the world over, and it is pleasant to get rid of  them. By the way, a son of the worthy Moknee, by a white woman now  dead--a lad of about twelve years of age--accompanies us, at least as  far as Mourzuk.    The most remarkable persons, however, whom I found at the encampment  were a couple of insane fellows, determined to follow us--perhaps to  show \"by one satiric touch\" what kind of madcap enterprise was ours. The  first was a Neapolitan, who had dogged me all the while I was at  Tripoli, pestering me to make a contract with him as servant. To humour  his madness, I never said I would not; and the poor fellow, taking my  silence for consent, had come out asking for his master. They tried to  send him away, but he would take orders from none but me. I gave him two  loaves of bread and a Tunisian piastre, and also made him a profound  bow, politely requesting him to go about his business. He did so in a  very dejected manner. During the time he was with the caravan he worked  as hard as any one else in his tattered clothes, and, perhaps, he would  have been of more use than many a sane person.    The other was a madman indeed, a Muslim, with an unpleasant habit of  threatening to cut everybody's throat. Hearing that we were going to  Soudan, he followed us, bringing with him a quantity of old metal,  principally copper, with which he proposed to trade. He gave himself out  as a shereef, or descendant of the Prophet. No sooner had he arrived  than he begun to quarrel on all sides, and, of course, talked very  freely of cutting throats, stabbing, shooting, and other humorous  things. Every one was afraid of him. He fawned, however, on us  Europeans, whilst he had a large knife concealed under his clothes ready  to strike. They were obliged at length to disarm him, and send him back  under a guard to Tripoli. We here took leave of Mr. Reade, who gave me  some last explanations about letters to the interior. It rained  furiously in the afternoon.    We were kept idle a whole day by the rain; but starting on the second,  turned off sharp in the afternoon towards the mountains, and encamped at  length in a pretty place fronting the great ascent of Gharian. The  appearance of the chain here differs in no important particular from  that of any other part of the Tripoline Atlas. The formation is  calcareous, but the colours vary to the eye by the admixture of  minerals. Groups of sandstone are not uncommon. Rounded, rugged heads,  vary the outline of the plateau; and here and there are deep, abrupt  valleys, cut down through the range, with groves of fig-trees, almonds,  aloes, pomegranates, and even grapes, nestling in their laps. Bright  water-courses, springing up in the depths of these ravines, sustain the  streaks of half-buried verdure.    We rose early to commence the ascent. It is not difficult unless the  camels are very heavily laden; but we did not reach the Castle of  Gharian until three in the afternoon. Our caravan dotted with groups of  various outline and colour the slopes of the spur, up the side of which  the track wound, in a very picturesque manner. Sometimes the foremost  camels stood still and complained; and then there was a half-halt  throughout the whole long line. The drivers plied the stick pretty  freely on the gaunt flanks of their beasts; the cry of \"_Isa! Isa!_\"  resounded in irregular chorus; pebbles and stones came leaping down at  the steep parts. As we rose over the brown slopes, the thin forests of  olive-trees partly covering the undulating plateau beyond, with fields  of barley and wheat here and there, gladdened our eyes, and contrasted  well with the hungry country we had left in the rear.    The castle, sufficiently picturesque in structure, is placed over a deep  ravine, but is commanded by the mountain behind. We turned back on  nearing it, and beheld the plain we had traversed appearing like the sea  enveloped in mist and cloud. In fine weather the minarets of Tripoli can  be seen, but now the northern horizon faded off in haze. On either hand  the steep declivities of the hills presented a wall-like surface, here  and there battered into breaches, from out of which burst little tufts  of green, revealing the presence of springs.    There are 200 troops stationed at the castle under Colonel Saleh, to  whom we paid an official visit; as also to the Kaid of Gharian. In both  cases we were hospitably treated to pipes, coffee, and lemonade. In this  canton are said to be the fanciful number of \"one hundred and one\" Arab  districts, inhabited by the Troglodytes. All the villages, indeed,  hereabouts, are underground: not a building is to be seen above, except  at wide intervals an old miserable, crumbling, Arab fort. The people are  easily kept in order by the summary Turkish method of proceeding; for  they are entirely disarmed, and matchlocks, powder and ball, are  contraband articles. The first word of an Oriental tax-gatherer is  \"Pay!\" and the second is \"Kill!\"    The outset of a journey in the East is usually employed in finding out  the vices of one's servants. Their virtues, I suppose, become manifest  afterwards. We were on the point of sending our chaouch back from  Gharian for dishonesty; but as we reflected that any substitute might be  still worse, we passed over the robbery of our barley, and merely  determined to keep a good look-out. This worthy, though useful in his  sphere, often, as I had anticipated, proved a sad annoyance to us. When  he seemed to refrain from cheating and stealing, he rendered our lives  troublesome by constant quarrellings and rows--he and his fellow  attached to my German companions--_Arcades ambo!_    Mr. Frederick Warrington and the American Consul "]]]
