The fan is so constructed  as to allow an uninterrupted passage through it, for the air, whilst  the fan is standing still; and the natural ventilation thus obtained  by means of the large chimney is found sufficient for clearing the  tunnel during the night and some portion of the day, without the fan  being worked at those times. This natural ventilation is aided by the  engine exhaust and the boiler discharging into the chimney. The fan  has now been in regular operation for three-quarters of a year, and  has been found completely successful.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPREGNATING WOOD WITH TAR OR OTHER PRESERVING MATERIAL.      The preservation of wood is a problem which is attracting increased  attention, as year by year diminishes the material supply of timber,  and consequently gradually increases its price. Among other methods  employed, the impregnation of wood by the vapors of tar, creosote,  petroleum, etc., has been tried, and one of the practical difficulties  met with has been the obtaining of suitable apparatus for the purpose.    [Illustration]    The engraving annexed is an invention intended to supply this want.  The wood is inclosed, in a tank kept hot by a steam jacket which  surrounds it, as shown. A boiler at one end is used to heat the  substance with which it is desired to impregnate the wood. An air pump  is also employed to remove the steam, generated in the heated timber,  and the air from the tank. The pores of the wood being thus rendered  vacuous, the hot liquid or vapors from the heating tank readily  penetrate the entire substance, and thoroughly impregnate it. This  apparatus is the invention of George Pustkuchen, of Hoboken, N. J.           *       *       *       *       *          BOARDMAN'S COMBINED TOOL.      This tool, of which our engraving is a good representation, comprises  a screw wrench, a pipe wrench, a hammer, a nail claw, a screw-driver,  and a bit handle, or socket wrench.    The bit handle is the entire tool, the square socket or opening being  made in the end of the handle, in which the shanks of bits may be  inserted.    The screw driver is formed on the end of the screw bar, attached to  the outer jaw of the wrench, and is taken out from the hollow of the  handle when required for use.    The use of the other parts of the tool will be apparent from the  engraving.    The tool is very compact, and has this advantage over the ordinary  screw wrench, that its leverage increases as it is opened to receive  nuts of larger size.    [Illustration]    This invention is protected by two patents, dated respectively, May  30, 1865, and July 10, 1866.    For further information address B.

[Illustration]    This instrument will be found of great service in bringing together  the ends of belts, the weight of which is so great that they cannot  be held together by the hand while lacing. A strap engages with holes  made in the belt, at the back of the holes punched for lacing, the  tightening strap being provided with claws or hooks, as shown. A winch  axle and ratchet, adjusted in a frame as shown, are then employed  to pull the ends of the belt together and hold them firmly till the  lacing is completed.    This is the invention of T. G. Stansberry, of Medora, Ill. Patented in  September, 1867.           *       *       *       *       *          SOME THINGS I DON'T WANT IN THE BUILDING TRADES.      I don't want my house put in repair, or rather out of repair, by a  master who employs \"Jacks of all Trades.\"    I don't want my foreman to tell me too much at one time about the  faults of the workmen under him, as I may forget asking him about  himself.    I don't want a builder or carpenter to give a coat of paint to any  joinery work he may be doing for me, until I have examined first the  material and workmanship.    I don't want any jobbing carpenter or joiner, whom I may employ, to  bring a lump of putty in his tool basket. I prefer leave the use of  putty to the painters.    I don't want jobbing plumbers to spend three days upon the roof,  soldering up a crack in the gutter, and, when done, leaving fresher  cracks behind them. The practice is something akin to \"cut and come  again.\"    I don't want a contractor to undertake a job at a price that he knows  will not pay, and then throw the fault of his bankruptcy on \"that  blackguard building.\"    I don't want any more hodmen to be carrying up the weight of  themselves in their hod, as well as their bricks; I would much prefer  seeing the poor human machines tempering the mortar or wheeling the  barrow, while the donkey engine, the hydraulic lift, or the old gray  horse, worked the pulley.    I don't want house doors to be made badly, hung badly, or composed of  green and unseasoned timber.    I don't want houses built first and designed afterwards, or, rather,  wedged into shape, and braced into form.    I don't want to be compelled to pay any workman a fair day's wages for  a half day's work.    I don't want an employer to act towards his workmen as if he thought  their sinews and thews were of iron, instead of flesh and blood.    I don't want any kind of old rubbish of brick and stone to be bundled  into walls and partitions, and then plastered over \"hurry-skurry.\"  Trade infamy, like murder, will out, sooner or later.    I don't want men to wear flesh and bone, and waste sweat and blood,  in forms of labor to which machinery can be applied, and by which  valuable human life and labor can be better and more profitably  utilized.           *       *       *       *       *          CORRESPONDENCE.    _The Editors are not responsible for the opinions expressed by their  Correspondents._             *       *       *       *       *      ACTION OF THE RECIPROCATING PARTS OF STEAM ENGINES.    MESSRS. EDITORS:--I have hesitated about the propriety of replying to  the criticisms of your correspondent, J. E. Hendricks, upon my paper,  on the action of the reciprocating parts of steam engines. It is not  to be expected that a truth so opposed to commonly received  notions--the reception of which requires so much to be unlearned--should  at once receive the assent of every one. Some odd fancies on the  subject are likely to be ventilated first.    But your correspondent touches the root of the matter, and perhaps the  fact questioned by him should be more clearly placed beyond dispute.    I will dismiss the introductory part of his letter, merely observing  that his \"logical inference\" is quite gratuitous and unwarranted. He  says himself that its absurdity is obvious, in which I quite agree  with him.    The real question is this: What is the figure representing the  acceleration of the motion of a piston, controlled by a crank which  revolves with a uniform velocity? I stated it to be a right-angled  triangle, and indicated, as I supposed, clearly enough, a simple  method by which this could be shown. Your correspondent claims that  the calculation, according to my own rule, gives a figure of a totally  different form, and one that shows the acceleration, as well as the  motion, to be reduced to zero at the commencement of the stroke. Let  us see. Let the straight line, AJ, in the following figure, represent  half the stroke of the piston, and let the distances, AB, AC, etc., on  this line, represent the versed sines of 10 deg., 20 deg., etc., up to 90 deg., or  the motion of the piston while the crank is moving through these arcs.  At the points A, B, C, etc., erect the perpendiculars, Aa, Bb, Cc,  etc., and let the length of each of these ordinates represent the  acceleration imparted in a given time at that point of the stroke.  Then will AJ be to Aa as IJ is to Ii, as HJ is to Hh, etc., showing  that the straight line, aJ, connects the extremities of all the  ordinates, and that the triangle, AJa, represents the acceleration of  the motion of the piston, from the commencement to the middle of the  stroke.    [Illustration]    The following table will enable any one to make the calculations  proving the truth of the above proposition:    Degrees.  Versed sine.     Motion for 10 deg.

The ordinary tables in the hand-books, going  only to five places of decimals, are of no use for these computations.    I would suggest a practical experiment. Let any one having an engine  running at a good speed, loosen the crank pin brasses a little, so  that, at starting, it will thump heavily. Let the engine be lightly  loaded, so that only a small portion of the boiler pressure will need  to be admitted to the cylinder. As its speed increases, the thump  will die away; and, if at its full speed, the pressure of the steam  admitted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19192"],[0,"What is Darwinism? (#6)"],[1,"process of natural  selection.\" (vol. i. p. 65)    The grand conclusion is, \"man (body, soul, and spirit) is descended from  a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably  arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World.\" (vol. ii.  p. 372) Mr. Darwin adds: \"He who denounces these views (as irreligious)  is bound to explain why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of  man as a distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the  laws of variation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of  the individual through the laws of ordinary reproduction.\" (vol. ii. p.  378)    FOOTNOTE:    [7] _Descent of Man_, etc. By Charles Darwin, M. A., F. R. S., etc. New  York, 1871, vol. i. p. 179.      _The Sense in which Mr. Darwin uses the Word \"Natural.\"_    We have not yet reached the heart of Mr. Darwin's theory. The main idea  of his system lies in the word \"natural.\" He uses that word in two  senses: first, as antithetical to the word artificial. Men can produce  very marked varieties as to structure and habits of animals. This is  exemplified in the production of the different breeds of horses, cattle,  sheep, and dogs; and specially, as Mr. Darwin seems to think, in the  case of pigeons. Of these, he says, \"The diversity of breeds is  something astonishing.\" Some have long, and some very short bills; some  have large feet, some small; some long necks, others long wings and  tails, while others have singularly short tails; some have thirty, and  even forty, tail-feathers, instead of the normal number of twelve or  fourteen. They differ as much in instinct as they do in form. Some are  carriers, some pouters, some tumblers, some trumpeters; and yet all are  descendants of the Rock Pigeon which is still extant. If, then, he  argues, man, in a comparatively short time, has by artificial selection  produced all these varieties, what might be accomplished on the  boundless scale of nature, during the measureless ages of the geologic  periods.    Secondly, he uses the word natural as antithetical to supernatural.  Natural selection is a selection made by natural laws, working without  intention and design. It is, therefore, opposed not only to artificial  selection, which is made by the wisdom and skill of man to accomplish a  given purpose, but also to supernatural selection, which means either a  selection originally intended by a power higher than nature; or which is  carried out by such power. In using the expression Natural Selection,  Mr. Darwin intends to exclude design, or final causes. All the changes  in structure, instinct, or intelligence, in the plants or animals,  including man, descended from the primordial germ, or animalcule, have  been brought about by unintelligent physical causes. On this point he  leaves us in no doubt. He defines nature to be \"the aggregate action and  product of natural laws; and laws are the sequence of events as  ascertained by us.\" It had been objected that he often uses teleological  language, speaking of purpose, intention, contrivance, adaptation, etc.  In answer to this objection, he says: \"It has been said, that I speak of  natural selection as a power or deity; but who objects to an author  speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the  planet?\" He admits that in the literal sense of the words, natural  selection is a false term; but \"who ever objected to chemists, speaking  of the elective affinities of various elements?--and yet an acid cannot  strictly be said to elect the base with which it in preference  combines.\" (p. 93) We have here an affirmation and a negation. It is  affirmed that natural selection is the operation of natural laws,  analogous to the action of gravitation and of chemical affinities. It is  denied that it is a process originally designed, or guided by  intelligence, such as the activity which foresees an end and consciously  selects and controls the means of its accomplishment. Artificial  selection, then, is an intelligent process; natural selection is not.    There are in the animal and vegetable worlds innumerable instances of at  least apparent contrivance, which have excited the admiration of men in  all ages. There are three ways of accounting for them. The first is the  Scriptural doctrine, namely, that God is a Spirit, a personal,  self-conscious, intelligent agent; that He is infinite, eternal, and  unchangeable in his being and perfections; that He is ever present; that  this presence is a presence of knowledge and power. In the external  world there is always and everywhere indisputable evidence of the  activity of two kinds of force: the one physical, the other mental. The  physical belongs to matter, and is due to the properties with which it  has been endowed; the other is the everywhere present and ever acting  mind of God. To the latter are to be referred all the manifestations of  design in nature, and the ordering of events in Providence. This  doctrine does not ignore the efficiency of second causes; it simply  asserts that God over-rules and controls them. Thus the Psalmist says,  \"I am fearfully and wonderfully made.... My substance was not hid from  thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought (or embroidered)  in the lower parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet  being imperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in  continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them.\" \"He  who fashioned the eye, shall not He see? He that formed the ear shall  not He hear?\" \"God makes the grass to grow, and herbs for the children  of men.\" He sends rain, frost, and snow. He controls the winds and the  waves. He determines the casting of the lot, the flight of an arrow, and  the falling of a sparrow. This universal and constant control of God is  not only one of the most patent and pervading doctrines of the Bible,  but it is one of the fundamental principles of even natural religion.    The second method of accounting for contrivances in nature admits that  they were foreseen and purposed by God, and that He endowed matter with  forces which He foresaw and intended should produce such results. But  here his agency stops. He never interferes to guide the operation of  physical causes. He does nothing to control the course of nature, or the  events of history. On this theory it may be said, (1.) That it is  utterly inconsistent with the Scriptures. (2.) It does not meet the  religious and moral necessities of our nature. It renders prayer  irrational and inoperative. It makes it vain for a man in any emergency  to look to God for help. (3.) It is inconsistent with obvious facts. We  see around us innumerable evidences of the constant activity of mind.  This evidence of mind and of its operations, according to Lord Brougham  and Dr. Whewell, is far more clear than that of the existence of matter  and of its forces. If one or the other is to be denied, it is the latter  rather than the former. Paley indeed says, that if the construction of a  watch be an undeniable evidence of design it would be a still more  wonderful manifestation of skill, if a watch could be made to produce  other watches; and, it may be added, not only other watches, but all  kinds of time-pieces in endless variety. So it has been asked, if man  can make a telescope, why cannot God make a telescope which produces  others like itself? This is simply asking, whether matter can be made to  do the work of mind? The idea involves a contradiction. For a telescope  to make a telescope, supposes it to select copper and zinc in due  proportions and fuse them into brass; to fashion that brass into  inter-entering tubes; to collect and combine the requisite materials for  the different kinds of glass needed; to melt them, grind, fashion, and  polish them; adjust their densities and focal distances, etc., etc. A  man who can believe that brass can do all this, might as well believe in  God. The most credulous men in the world are unbelievers. The great  Napoleon could not believe in Providence; but he believed in his star,  and in lucky and unlucky days.    This banishing God from the world is simply intolerable, and, blessed be  his name, impossible. An absent God who does nothing is, to us, no God.  Christ brings God constantly near to us. He said to his disciples,  \"Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; which have neither  store-house nor barn; and God feedeth them; how much better are ye than  the fowls. And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one  cubit? Consider the lilies how they grow; they toil not, neither do they  spin; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not  arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is  to-day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more  will He clothe you, O ye of little faith.\" \"And seek ye not what ye  shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. For  all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father  knoweth that ye have need of these things.\" It may be said that Christ  did not teach science. True, but He taught truth; and science, so  called, when it comes in conflict with truth, is what man is when he  comes in conflict with God.    The advocates of these extreme opinions protest against being considered  irreligious. Herbert Spencer says, that his doctrine of an inscrutable,  unintelligent, unknown force, as the cause of all things, is a much more  religious doctrine than that of a personal, intelligent, and voluntary  Being of infinite power and goodness. Matthew Arnold holds that an  unconscious \"power which makes for right,\" is a higher idea of God than  the Jehovah of the Bible. Christ says, God is a Spirit. Holbach thought  that he made a great advance on that definition, when he said, God is  motion.    The third method of accounting for the contrivances manifested"]]]
