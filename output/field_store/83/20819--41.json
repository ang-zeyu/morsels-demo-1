A French word, generally used in heraldry instead of the  English word abased. When the fess, or any other ordinary properly  placed above the fess point of the shield, is brought below it, that  ordinary is said to be _abaisse_.    ABATEMENT. Any figure added to coats of arms tending to lower  the dignity or station of the bearer. Thus, the baton, denoting  illegitimacy, is an abatement: so, also, are the differences in coats  of arms showing the degrees of consanguinity.    ADDORSED. Any animals set back to back. See LION.    ALLERION. An eagle displayed, without beak or feet.    [Illustration: Allerion]    Ex. Argent, an allerion gules.    ALTERNATE. Figures or tinctures that succeed each other by turns.    AMETHYST. A precious stone of a violet colour, the name of which was  formerly used instead of purpure, to denote the purple tincture when  emblazoning the arms of the English nobility.    ANNULET. A small circle borne as a charge in coats of arms.    [Illustration: Annulet]    Ex. Azure, an annulet argent. Annulets are added to arms for a  difference. See DIFFERENCES, p. 13. [CHAP. III.]    ANCIENT. A small flag or ensign. The bearer of the flag was called by  its name. _Iago_ was ancient to the troops commanded by _Othello_.      \"This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.    The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.\"   SHAKSPEARE.    ARCHBISHOPS. Church dignitaries of the first class. There are but two  in England--the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York.  The former is the first peer of England next to the royal family, and  has the title of _Grace_ given to him; and likewise _Most Reverend  Father in God_. He is styled Primate of all England, and Metropolitan.    The Archbishop of York has precedence of dukes and great officers of  state, except the lord chancellor. He is called _His Grace_ and  _Most Reverend Father in God_; and styled _Primate of England_ and  _Metropolitan_.    ARGENT. The French word for silver, of which metal all white fields or  charges are supposed to consist.    [Illustration: Argent]    ARMED. This word is used to express the horns, hoofs, beak, or talons  of any beast or bird of prey, when borne of a different tincture from  those of their bodies.    [Illustration: Armed]    Ex. Crest, a demi-griffin armed, gules.    ARMORIST. A person skilled in the bearings of coats of arms, and all  relating to their emblazonment.    ARMS. A word derived from the Latin _arma_, which signifies in  Heraldry a mark of honour, serving to distinguish states, cities,  families, &c.    ARROWS. Short darts feathered at the ends.    [Illustration: Arrows]    Ex. Argent, three arrows paleways, points in chief sable, feathered.    ASPECTANT. Animals placed face to face in a charge are said to be  aspectant. If they are about to attack each other, they are said to be  combatant.    ASSUMPTIVE. Arms assumed without being sanctioned by a grant from the  College of Heralds.    ASSURGENT. A man or beast rising out of the sea is said to be  assurgent.    ATCHIEVEMENT. The coat of arms fully emblazoned according to the rules  of Heraldry. The lozenge-shaped atchievements that are displayed on  the outside of the houses of persons deceased are commonly called  Hatchments.    ATTIRED. When the horns of a stag are of a different tincture to its  head, it is said to be attired.    [Illustration: Attired]    Ex. Argent, a stag lodged, proper, attired, or    AUGMENTATION. This word signifies in Heraldry a particular mark of  honour, granted by the sovereign in consideration of some noble  action, or by favour; and either quartered with the family arms, or on  an escutcheon or canton.    [Illustration: Augmentation]    Ex. Ermine, on a chevron azure, three foxes' heads erased, argent. The  augmentation is in a canton azure, a fleur-de-lis argent.    AZURE. The French word for _blue_: it is distinguished in heraldic  engraving by lines running parallel to each other in an horizontal  direction, as in the annexed example.    [Illustration: Azure]    BADGE. A distinctive mark worn by servants, retainers, and followers  of royalty or nobility, who, being beneath the rank of gentlemen, have  no right to armorial bearings. The rose and crown is the badge of the  servants, &c., of the Kings of England: they are displayed as in the  annexed example.    [Illustration: Badge (Rose and Crown)]    BANDED. Anything tied with a band.    [Illustration: Banded]    Ex. Argent. Three arrows proper, banded.    BANNER. The principal standard of a knight. The great banner borne at  the funeral of a nobleman contains all the quarterings of his arms: it  varies in size according to the rank of the deceased. The banner of  the sovereign is five feet square; that of a prince or duke, four feet  square; for all noblemen of inferior rank, three feet square.    BANNER ROLL is a small square flag containing a single escutcheon of  the deceased. Thus, if there are twelve quarterings in the banner,  the same number of banner rolls will be required to be borne in  the funeral procession. The annexed engraving shows the banner and  banner-roll.    [Illustration: Banner roll]    BAR. An honourable ordinary, occupying one-fifth of the shield. It may  be placed in any part of the field. It has two diminutives, the closet  and barrulet.    [Illustration: Bar]    Ex. Ermine, two bars gules.    BARBED. Bearded. It is also applied to roses.    [Illustration: Barbed]    Ex. Azure, a rose argent, barbed, and seeded proper.    BARON. The lowest title of the peerage of Great Britain.    BARON AND FEMME. Terms used in Heraldry to denote the arms of a man  and his wife, marshalled together. See p. 38. [CHAP. VI.]    BARRULET. The smallest diminutive of the bar. The closet is half the  bar; the barrulet half the closet.    [Illustration: Barrulet]    Ex. Gules, two barrulets argent.    BARRY. A field divided transversely into several equal parts, and  consisting of two different tinctures interchangeably disposed.    [Illustration: Barry]    Ex. Barry of eight pieces, azure and argent.    BATON. BATUNE. BASTON. It is generally used as an abatement in coats  of arms to denote illegitimacy.    [Illustration: Baton]    Ex. Or, a cross gules, over all a baton argent.    BATTERING RAM. An instrument used for battering down walls before  gunpowder was known in Europe: it is frequently borne as a charge in a  coat of arms.    [Illustration: Battering ram]    Ex. Argent, a battering ram proper.    BATTLE AXE. An ancient military weapon, frequently borne on arms as a  mark of prowess.    [Illustration: Battle axe]    Ex. Argent, three battle axes gules two over one.    BATTLEMENTS. Divisions or apertures on the top of castle walls or  towers.    [Illustration: Battlements]    Ex. Gules, three towers embattled argent.    BEAKED. The beak of a bird being of a different tint from the body is  said to be beaked.    [Illustration: Beaked]    Ex.

Laboratory work and shop work  engender a habit of observation, a knowledge of the difference between  accuracy and vagueness, and an insight into nature's complexity and into  the inadequacy of all abstract verbal accounts of real phenomena, which  once wrought into the mind, remain there as lifelong possessions. They  confer precision; because, if you are _doing_ a thing, you must do it  definitely right or definitely wrong. They give honesty; for, when you  express yourself by making things, and not by using words, it becomes  impossible to dissimulate your vagueness or ignorance by ambiguity.  They beget a habit of self-reliance; they keep the interest and  attention always cheerfully engaged, and reduce the teacher's  disciplinary functions to a minimum.    Of the various systems of manual training, so far as woodwork is  concerned, the Swedish Sloyd system, if I may have an opinion on such  matters, seems to me by far the best, psychologically considered. Manual  training methods, fortunately, are being slowly but surely introduced  into all our large cities. But there is still an immense distance to  traverse before they shall have gained the extension which they are  destined ultimately to possess.           *       *       *       *       *    No impression without expression, then,--that is the first pedagogic  fruit of our evolutionary conception of the mind as something  instrumental to adaptive behavior. But a word may be said in  continuation. The expression itself comes back to us, as I intimated a  moment ago, in the form of a still farther impression,--the impression,  namely, of what we have done. We thus receive sensible news of our  behavior and its results. We hear the words we have spoken, feel our own  blow as we give it, or read in the bystander's eyes the success or  failure of our conduct. Now this return wave of impression pertains to  the completeness of the whole experience, and a word about its  importance in the schoolroom may not be out of place.    It would seem only natural to say that, since after acting we normally  get some return impression of result, it must be well to let the pupil  get such a return impression in every possible case. Nevertheless, in  schools where examination marks and 'standing' and other returns of  result are concealed, the pupil is frustrated of this natural  termination of the cycle of his activities, and often suffers from the  sense of incompleteness and uncertainty; and there are persons who  defend this system as encouraging the pupil to work for the work's sake,  and not for extraneous reward. Of course, here as elsewhere, concrete  experience must prevail over psychological deduction. But, so far as our  psychological deduction goes, it would suggest that the pupil's  eagerness to know how well he does is in the line of his normal  completeness of function, and should never be balked except for very  definite reasons indeed.    Acquaint them, therefore, with their marks and standing and prospects,  unless in the individual case you have some special practical reason for  not so doing.          VI. NATIVE REACTIONS AND ACQUIRED REACTIONS      We are by this time fully launched upon the biological conception. Man  is an organism for reacting on impressions: his mind is there to help  determine his reactions, and the purpose of his education is to make  them numerous and perfect. _Our education means, in short, little more  than a mass of possibilities of reaction,_ acquired at home, at school,  or in the training of affairs. The teacher's task is that of supervising  the acquiring process.    This being the case, I will immediately state a principle which  underlies the whole process of acquisition and governs the entire  activity of the teacher. It is this:--    _Every acquired reaction is, as a rule, either a complication grafted on  a native reaction, or a substitute for a native reaction, which the same  object originally tended to provoke._    _The teacher's art consists in bringing about the substitution or  complication, and success in the art presupposes a sympathetic  acquaintance with the reactive tendencies natively there_.    Without an equipment of native reactions on the child's part, the  teacher would have no hold whatever upon the child's attention or  conduct. You may take a horse to the water, but you cannot make him  drink; and so you may take a child to the schoolroom, but you cannot  make him learn the new things you wish to impart, except by soliciting  him in the first instance by something which natively makes him react.  He must take the first step himself. He must _do_ something before you  can get your purchase on him. That something may be something good or  something bad. A bad reaction is better than no reaction at all; for, if  bad, you can couple it with consequences which awake him to its badness.  But imagine a child so lifeless as to react in _no_ way to the teacher's  first appeals, and how can you possibly take the first step in his  education?    To make this abstract conception more concrete, assume the case of a  young child's training in good manners. The child has a native tendency  to snatch with his hands at anything that attracts his curiosity; also  to draw back his hands when slapped, to cry under these latter  conditions, to smile when gently spoken to, and to imitate one's  gestures.    Suppose now you appear before the child with a new toy intended as a  present for him. No sooner does he see the toy than he seeks to snatch  it. You slap the hand; it is withdrawn, and the child cries. You then  hold up the toy, smiling and saying, \"Beg for it nicely,--so!\" The child  stops crying, imitates you, receives the toy, and crows with pleasure;  and that little cycle of training is complete. You have substituted the  new reaction of 'begging' for the native reaction of snatching, when  that kind of impression comes.    Now, if the child had no memory, the process would not be educative. No  matter how often you came in with a toy, the same series of reactions  would fatally occur, each called forth by its own impression: see,  snatch; slap, cry; hear, ask; receive, smile. But, with memory there,  the child, at the very instant of snatching, recalls the rest of the  earlier experience, thinks of the slap and the frustration, recollects  the begging and the reward, inhibits the snatching impulse, substitutes  the 'nice' reaction for it, and gets the toy immediately, by eliminating  all the intermediary steps. If a child's first snatching impulse be  excessive or his memory poor, many repetitions of the discipline may be  needed before the acquired reaction comes to be an ingrained habit; but  in an eminently educable child a single experience will suffice.    One can easily represent the whole process by a brain-diagram. Such a  diagram can be little more than a symbolic translation of the immediate  experience into spatial terms; yet it may be useful, so I subjoin it.    [Illustration: FIGURE 1. THE BRAIN-PROCESSES BEFORE EDUCATION.]    Figure 1 shows the paths of the four successive reflexes executed by the  lower or instinctive centres. The dotted lines that lead from them to  the higher centres and connect the latter together, represent the  processes of memory and association which the reactions impress upon the  higher centres as they take place.    [Illustration: FIGURE 2. THE BRAIN-PROCESS AFTER EDUCATION.]    In Figure 2 we have the final result. The impression _see_ awakens the  chain of memories, and the only reactions that take place are the _beg_  and _smile_. The thought of the _slap_, connected with the activity of  Centre 2, inhibits the _snatch_, and makes it abortive, so it is  represented only by a dotted line of discharge not reaching the  terminus. Ditto of the _cry_ reaction. These are, as it were,  short-circuited by the current sweeping through the higher centres from  _see_ to _smile_. _Beg_ and _smile_, thus substituted for the original  reaction _snatch_, become at last the immediate responses when the  child sees a snatchable object in some one's hands.    The first thing, then, for the teacher to understand is the native  reactive tendencies,--the impulses and instincts of childhood,--so as to  be able to substitute one for another, and turn them on to artificial  objects.           *       *       *       *       *    It is often said that man is distinguished from the lower animals by  having a much smaller assortment of native instincts and impulses than  they, but this is a great mistake. Man, of course, has not the  marvellous egg-laying instincts which some articulates have; but, if we  compare him with the mammalia, we are forced to confess that he is  appealed to by a much larger array of objects than any other mammal,  that his reactions on these objects are characteristic and determinate  in a very high degree. The monkeys, and especially the anthropoids, are  the only beings that approach him in their analytic curiosity and width  of imitativeness. His instinctive impulses, it is true, get overlaid by  the secondary reactions due to his superior reasoning power; but thus  man loses the _simply_ instinctive demeanor. But the life of instinct  is only disguised in him, not lost; and when the higher brain-functions  are in abeyance, as happens in imbecility or dementia, his instincts  sometimes show their presence in truly brutish ways.    I will therefore say a few words about those instinctive tendencies  which are the most important from the teacher's point of view.          VII. WHAT THE NATIVE REACTIONS ARE      First of all, _Fear_. Fear of punishment has always been the great  weapon of the teacher, and will always, of course, retain some place in  the conditions of the schoolroom. The subject is so familiar that  nothing more "]]]
