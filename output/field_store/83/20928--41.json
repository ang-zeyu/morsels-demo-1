If he can't find Reddy Fox, just as likely as not he'll point  it at somebody else just fo' fun. Ah hope he doan meet up with mah ol'  woman or any of mah li'l' pickaninnies. Ah'm plumb afraid of a boy with  a gun, Ah am. 'Pears like he doan have any sense. Ah reckon Ah better be  moving along right smart and tell mah family to stay right close in  the ol' hollow tree,\" muttered Unc' Billy Possum, slipping out from his  hiding place. Then Unc' Billy began to run as fast as he could toward  the Green Forest.          XVIII. The Hunt for Reddy Fox    \"Trouble, trouble, trouble, I feel it in the air; Trouble, trouble,  trouble, it's round me everywhere.\"    Old Granny Fox muttered this over and over, as she kept walking around  uneasily and sniffing the air.    \"I don't see any trouble and I don't feel any trouble in the air.  It's all in the sore places where I was shot,\" said Reddy Fox, who was  stretched out on the doorstep of their home.    \"That's because you haven't got any sense. When you do get some and  learn to look where you are going, you won't get shot from behind  old tree trunks and you will be able to feel trouble when it is near,  without waiting for it to show itself. Now I feel trouble. You go down  into the house and stay there!\" Granny Fox stopped to test the air with  her nose, just as she had been testing it for the last ten minutes.    \"I don't want to go in,\" whined Reddy Fox. \"It's nice and warm out here,  and I feel a lot better than when I am curled up way down there in the  dark.\"    Old Granny Fox turned, and her eyes blazed as she looked at Reddy Fox.  She didn't say a word. She didn't have to. Reddy just crawled into his  house, muttering to himself. Granny stuck her head in at the door.    \"Don't you come out until I come back,\" she ordered. Then she added:  \"Farmer Brown's boy is coming with his gun.\"    Reddy Fox shivered when he heard that. He didn't believe Granny Fox. He  thought she was saying that just to scare him and make him stay inside.  But he shivered just the same. You see, he knew now what it meant to  be shot, for he was still too stiff and sore to run, all because he had  gone too near Farmer Brown's boy and his gun.    But old Granny Fox had not been fooling when she told Reddy Fox that  Farmer Brown's boy was coming with a gun. It was true. He was coming  down the Lone Little Path, and ahead of him was trotting Bowser the  Hound. How did old Granny Fox know it? She just felt it! She didn't hear  them, she didn't see them, and she didn't smell them; she just felt that  they were coming. So as soon as she saw that Reddy Fox had obeyed her,  she was off like a little red flash.    \"It won't do to let them find our home,\" said Granny to herself, as she  disappeared in the Green Forest.    First she hurried to a little point on the hill where she could look  down the Lone Little Path. Just as she expected, she saw Farmer Brown's  boy, and ahead of him, sniffing at every bush and all along the Lone  Little Path, was Bowser the Hound. Old Granny Fox waited to see no more.  She ran as fast as she could in a big circle which brought her out on  the Lone Little Path below Farmer Brown's boy and Bowser the Hound, but  where they couldn't see her, because of a turn in the Lone Little Path.  She trotted down the Lone Little Path a very little way and then turned  into the woods and hurried back up the hill, where she sat down and  waited. In a few minutes she heard Bowser's great voice. He had smelled  her track in the Lone Little Path and was following it. Old Granny Fox  grinned. You see, she was planning to lead them far, far away from the  home where Reddy Fox was hiding, for it would not do to have them find  it.    And Farmer Brown's boy also grinned, as he heard the voice of Bowser the  Hound.    \"I'll hunt that fox until I get him,\" he said. You see, he didn't know  anything about old Granny Fox; he thought Bowser was following Reddy  Fox.          XIX Unc' Billy Possum Gives Warning    \"What's the matter with you, Unc' Billy? You look as if you had lost  your last friend.\" It was Jimmy Skunk who spoke.    Unc' Billy Possum stopped short. He had been hurrying so fast that he  hadn't seen Jimmy Skunk at all.    \"Matter enuff, Suh! Matter enuff!\" said Unc' Billy Possum, when he could  get his breath. \"Do you hear that noise?\"    \"Sure, I hear that noise. That's only Bowser the Hound chasing old  Granny Fox. When she gets tired she'll lose him,\" replied Jimmy Skunk.  \"What are you worrying about Bowser the Hound for?\"    \"Bowser the Hound will have to be smarter than he is now befo' he can  worry me, Ah reckon,\" said Unc' Billy Possum scornfully. \"It isn't  Bowser the Hound; it's Farmer Brown's boy and his gun!\" Then Unc'  Billy told Jimmy Skunk how he had been hiding in the woodpile at Farmer  Brown's and had heard Farmer Brown's boy say that he was going to hunt  over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest until he got Reddy  Fox.    \"What of it?\" asked Jimmy Skunk. \"If he gets Reddy Fox, so much the  better. Reddy always did make trouble for other people. I don't see what  you're worrying about Reddy Fox for. He's big enough to take care of  himself.\"    \"Yo' cert'nly are plumb slow in your wits this morning, Jimmy Skunk,  yo' cert'nly are plumb slow! Supposing yo' should meet up with Farmer  Brown's boy with that gun in his hands and supposing he had grown tired  of watching fo' Reddy Fox. That gun might go off, Jimmy Skunk; it might  go off when it was pointing right straight at yo'!\" said Unc' Billy  Possum.    Jimmy Skunk looked serious. \"That's so, Unc' Billy, that's so!\" he said.  \"Boys with guns do get dreadfully careless, dreadfully careless. They  don't seem to think anything about the feelings of those likely to get  hurt when the gun goes off. What was you thinking of doing, Unc' Billy?\"    \"Just passing the word along so everybody in the Green Meadows and  in the Green Forest will keep out of the way of Farmer Brown's boy,\"  replied Unc' Billy Possum.    \"Good idea, Unc' Billy! I'll help you,\" said Jimmy Skunk.    So Unc' Billy Possum went one way, and Jimmy Skunk went another way.  And everyone they told hurried to tell someone else. Happy Jack Squirrel  told Chatterer the Red Squirrel; Chatterer told Striped Chipmunk, and  Striped Chipmunk told Danny Meadow Mouse. Danny Meadow Mouse told Johnny  Chuck; Johnny Chuck told Peter Rabbit; Peter Rabbit told Jumper the  Hare; Jumper the Hare told Prickly Porky; Prickly Porky told Bobby Coon;  Bobby Coon told Billy Mink; Billy Mink told Little Joe Otter; Little Joe  Otter told Jerry Muskrat, and Jerry Muskrat told Grandfather Frog. And  everybody hastened to hide from Farmer Brown's boy and his terrible gun.    By and by Farmer Brown's boy noticed how still it was in the Green  Forest. Nowhere did he see or hear a bird. Nowhere could he catch a  glimpse of anybody who wore fur.    \"That fox must have scared away all the other animals and driven away  all the birds. I'll get him! See if I don't!\" muttered Farmer Brown's  boy, and never once guessed that they were hiding from him.          XX. Old Granny Fox Makes a Mistake    Old Granny Fox was running through the overgrown old pasture, way up  back of Farmer Brown's. She was cross and tired and hot, for it was a  very warm day. Behind her came Bowser the Hound, his nose in Granny's  tracks, and making a great noise with his big voice. Granny Fox was  cross because she was tired. She hadn't done much running lately. She  didn't mind running when the weather was cold, but now--\"Oh dear, it is  hot!\" sighed old Granny Fox, as she stopped a minute to rest.    Now old Granny Fox is very, very smart and very, very wise. She knows  all the tricks with which foxes fool those who try to catch them. She  knew that she could fool Bowser the Hound and puzzle him so that he  wouldn't be able to follow her track at all. But she wasn't ready to do  that yet. No, indeed! Old Granny Fox was taking great care to see that  her tracks were easy to follow. She wanted Bowser the Hound to follow  them, although it made her tired and hot and cross. Why did she? Well,  you see, she was trying to lead him, and with him Farmer Brown's boy,  far, far away from the home where Reddy Fox was nursing the wounds  that he had received when Farmer Brown's boy had shot at him a few days  before.    \"Bow, wow, wow!\" roared Bowser the Hound, following every twist and turn  which Granny Fox made, just as she wanted him to. Back and forth across  the old pasture and way up among the rocks on the edge of the mountain  Granny Fox led Bowser the Hound. It was a long, long, long way from the  Green Meadows and the Green Forest. Granny Fox had made it a long way  purposely. She was willing to be tired herself if she could also tire  Bowser the Hound and Farmer Brown's boy. She wanted to tire them so that  when she finally puzzled and fooled them and left them there, they would  be too tired to go back to the Green Meadows.    By and by Granny Fox came to a hole in the ground, an old house that  had once belonged to her grandfather. Now this old house had a back door  hidden close beside the hollow trunk of a fallen tree. Old Granny Fox  just ran through the house, out the back door, through the hollow tree,  and then jumped into a little brook where there was hardly more than  enough water to wet her feet. Walking in the water, she left no scent in  her tracks.    Bowser the Hound came roaring up to the front door of the old house.  Granny's tracks led right inside, and Bowser grew so excited that he  made a tremendous noise. At last he had found where Granny Fox lived; at  least he thought he had. He was sure that she was inside, for there  were her fresh tracks going inside and none coming out. Bowser the Hound  never once thought of looking for a back door. If he had, he wouldn't  have been any the wiser,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#6)"],[1," passions and selfish ends; for without question, under this side  heaven, there is nothing so sacred as the life of man; for the  preservation whereof all policies and forms of government, all laws  and magistrates are most especially ordained. Wherefore I presume that  this Discourse of mine, attempting to prove the vanity and  impossibility of witchcraft, is so far from any deserved censure and  blame, that it rather deserves commendation and praise, if I can in  the least measure contribute to the saving of the lives of men.\"    [Footnote 22: I have not seen his earlier work, \"Historical  Reflections on the Bishop of Rome, &c.\" Oxford, 1660, 4to. If it be  written with any portion of the power evinced in his \"Question of  Witchcraft Debated,\" the ridicule with which Wood says it was received  by the wits of the university, and the oblivion into which it  subsequently fell, were both equally undeserved.]    Wagstaffe was answered by Meric Casaubon in his treatise \"Of Credulity  and Incredulity in Things Divine and Spiritual,\" 1670, 12mo; and if  his reply be altogether inconclusive, it cannot be denied to be, as  indeed every thing of Meric Casaubon's writing was, learned,  discursive and entertaining. He observes of Wagstaffe:--    \"He doth make some show of a scholar and a man of some learning, but  whether he doth acquit himself as a gentleman (which I hear he is) in  it, I shall leave to others to judge.\" This is surely the first time  that a belief in witchcraft was ever made a test of gentlemanly  propriety.    Two years before the trial, which is the subject of the following  republication, took place, the hamlet of Thornton, in the parish of  Coxwold, in the adjoining county of York, gave birth to one who was  destined so utterly to demolish the unstable and already shaken and  tottering structure which Bodin, Delrio, and their followers had set  up, as not to leave one stone of that unhallowed edifice remaining  upon another. Of the various course of life of John Webster, the  author of \"The Displaying of supposed Witchcraft,\" his travels,  troubles, and persecutions; of the experience he had had in restless  youth and in unsettled manhood of religion under various forms,  amongst religionists of almost every denomination; and of those  profound and wide-ranging researches in every art and science in which  his vigorous intellect delighted, and by which it was in declining age  enlightened, sobered and composed; it is much to be regretted that we  have not his own narrative, written in the calm evening of his days,  when he walked the slopes of Pendle, from where,                \"Through shadow dimly seen      Rose Clid'row's castle grey;\"[23]    when, to use his own expressions, he lived a \"solitary and sedentary  life, _mihi et musis_, having more converse with the dead than the  living, that is, more with books than with men.\" The facts for his  biography are scanty and meagre, and are rather collected by inference  from his works, than from any other source. He was born at Thornton on  the 3rd of February, 1610. From a passing notice of A. a Wood, and an  incidental allusion in his own works, he may be presumed to have  passed some time at Cambridge, though with what views, or at what  period of his life, is uncertain. He was ordained Presbyter by Dr.  Morton, when Bishop of Durham, who was, it will be recollected, the  sagacious prelate by whom the frauds of the boy of Bilson were  detected. In the year 1634, Webster was curate of Kildwick in Craven,  and while in that cure the scene occurred which he has so vividly  sketched in the passage after quoted, and which supplied the hint, and  laid the foundation, for the work which has perpetuated his fame. How  long he continued in this cure we know not: but, if one authority may  be relied on, he was Master of the Free Grammar School at Clitheroe in  1643. To this foundation he may be considered as a great benefactor,  for, from information supplied from a manuscript source, I find that  he recovered for its use, with considerable trouble and no small  personal charge, an income of about L60. per annum, which had been  given to the school, but was illegally diverted and withheld. From  this period there is a blank in his biography for about ten years.  Most probably his life was rambling and desultory. He speaks of  himself as having been about that time a chaplain in the army. His  first two works, published in 1653 and 1654, \"The Saints' Guide,\" and  \"The Judgment Set and the Books Opened,\"[24] show that in the  interval he had deserted the Established Church, and, probably, after  some of those restless fluctuations of belief to which men of his  ardent temperament are subject, settled at last in a wilder sort of  Independency, which he eulogizes as \"unmanacling the simple and pure  light of the Gospel from the chains and fetters of cold and dead  formality, and of restrictive and compulsory power.\" His language in  these two works is more assimilated to that of the Seekers or Quakers,  which it resembles in the cloudy mysteriousness of its phraseology,  than that of the more rational and sober writers of the Independent  school. Amongst the dregs of fanaticism of which they consist, the  reader will look in vain for any germ or promise of future excellence  or distinction as an author. It would seem that he preached the  sermons contained in \"The Judgment Set and Books Opened\" at the church  of All-Hallows, Lombard-street, at which he must have been for some  time the officiating minister, and where the amusing incident, in  which Webster was concerned, narrated by Wood, which had many a  parallel in those times, no doubt occurred. \"On the 12th of Oct.,  1653,\" says the author of the _Athenae._,[25] \"he (_i.e._ William  Erbury) with John Webster, sometimes a Cambridge scholar, endeavoured  to knock down learning and the ministry both together, in a  disputation that they then had against two ministers in a church in  Lombard-street, in London. Erbury then declared that the wisest  ministers and purest churches were at that time befool'd, confounded,  and defil'd, by reason of learning. Another while he said, that the  ministry were monsters, beasts, asses, greedy dogs, false prophets;  and that they are the Beast with seven heads and ten horns. The same  person also spoke out and said that Babylon is the Church in her  ministers, and that the Great Whore is the Church in her worship, &c.;  so that with him there was an end of ministers and churches and  ordinations altogether. While these things were babbled to and fro,  the multitude being of various opinions, began to mutter, and many to  cry out, and immediately it came to a meeting or tumult, (call it  which you please,) _wherein the women bore away the Bell, but lost  some of them their kerchiefs_: and the dispute being hot, there was  more danger of pulling down the church than the ministry.\"[26]    [Footnote 23: \"Poems, by the Rev.
