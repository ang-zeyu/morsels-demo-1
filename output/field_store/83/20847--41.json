Sec.4. Then she set him afloat, and that very Night the Tide carried him  ashore on that Island we just now mention'd; it fortun'd that the Water  being high, carried the Ark a great way on shore, farther than it would  have done at another time, (for it rises so high but once a Year) and  cast the Ark into a little shady Grove, thick set with Trees, a pleasant  place, where he was secured both from Wind and Sun; when the Tide ebb'd,  the Ark was left there, and the Wind rising blew an heap of Sand  together between the Ark and the Sea, sufficient to secure him from any  future danger of such another Flood.    Sec. 5. The Violence of the Waves had loosned the Joints of the Ark; the  Boy was Hungry and Cry'd. It happen'd fortunately at that Juncture of  time, that a Roe wandring about the Island in search of her Fawn, which  straying was devoured by an Eagle, heard the Boy cry, and following the  voice (imagining it to have been her Fawn) came up to the Ark, which she  immediately attack'd, and what with her beating it with her hoofs  without, and the Boy's struggling within, at last between 'em both they  loosned a board: as soon as she saw him she shew'd the same natural  Affection to him as if he had been her own, Suckled him and took care of  him. This is the account which they give, who are not willing to believe  that a Man can be produced without Father or Mother.    Sec. 6. On the other hand, those who affirm that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ was  produced in that Island without Father and Mother[18], tell us, that in  that island, in a piece of Low ground, it chanc'd that a certain Mass of  Earth was so fermented in some period of Years, that the four qualities,  _viz. Hot, Cold, Dry, Moist_, were so equally mix'd, that none of 'em  prevail'd over the other; and that this Mass was of a very great Bulk,  in which, some parts were better and more equally Temper'd than  others,and consequently fitter for Generation; the middle part  especially, which came nearest to the Temper of Man's Body. This Matter  being in a fermentation, there arose some Bubbles by reason of its  viscousness, and it chanc'd that in the midst of it there was a viscous  Substance with a very little bubble in it, which was divided into two  with a thin partition, full of Spirituous and Aerial Substance, and of  the most exact Temperature imaginable. That the Matter being thus  dispos'd, there was, by the Command of God, a Spirit infus'd into it;  which was join'd so closely to it, that it can scarce be separated from  it even so much as in thought; which did as constantly influence this  Mass of matter as the Sun do's the World. Now there are some Bodies from  whence we perceive no Reflection of Light, as the thin Air: others from  which we do but imperfectly; such are thick Bodies which are not smooth  (but there is a difference in these, and the difference of their Colours  arises from the different manner of their Reception of the Rays); and  from others we receive the Reflection in the highest degree, as from  Bodies which are smooth and polish'd, as Looking-Glasses and the like;  so that those Glasses when ground after a particular manner will Collect  so much Light as to kindle a Fire. So that Spirit which comes by the  Command of God, do's at all times act upon all Creatures, in some of  which notwithstanding, there appears no Impression of it, but the reason  of that is, because of their Incapacity into whom it is infus'd; of  which kind are things inanimate which are fitly represented in this  similitude, by the thin Air. There are another sort again; in which  there does appear something of it, as Vegetables and the like, which are  represented by the thick Bodies we mention'd, which are not polish'd.  And then lastly, there are others, (represented by those Glasses, in our  last comparison) in which the impressions of this Spirit are visible,  and such we reckon all sorts of Animals. But then, as these smooth and  polish'd Bodies which are of the same figure with the Sun [i.e.  Spherical] do receive the Rays in a more plentiful manner than any other  whatsoever, so also do some Animals receive the Influence of that Spirit  more than others, because they are more like to that Spirit and are  form'd after his Image: such is Man particularly, which is hinted before  where 'tis said that _God made Man after his own Image_[19].    Sec. 7. Now, when this Form prevails to such a degree that all others are  nothing before it, but it remains alone, so as to consume, with the  glory of its Light, whatsoever stands; in it's way; then it is properly  compared to those Glasses, which reflect Light upon themselves, and burn  every thing else; But this is a degree which is peculiar to the  Prophets.    Sec. 8. But to return, and speak something more fully concerning the  Opinion of those who account for this kind of generation; They tell us,  that as soon as this Spirit was join'd to the Receptacle, all the other  powers immediately, by the Command of God, submitted themselves to it.  Now, opposite to this Receptacle, there arose another Bubble divided  into three Receptacles by thin membranes, with passages from one to the  other, which were fill'd with an aerial substance, not much unlike that  which was in the first Receptacle, only the first was something finer;  and in each of these three Ventricles,which were all taken out of one,  were plac'd some of those Faculties, which were subject to this  governing Spirit, and were appointed to take care of their respective  Stations, and to communicate every thing, both great and small, to that  Spirit, which we told you before was plac'd in the first Receptacle.  Right against this Receptacle, opposite to the second, there arose  another third Bubble, fill'd with an aerial substance, which was grosser  than that which was in the other two; this was made for the  Entertainment and preservation of some other of the inferior Faculties.    Sec. 9. Thus these three Receptacles were made in the same order which we  have describ'd, and these were the first part of that great Mass which  was form'd; now they stood in need of one another's assistance; the  first wanted the other two as Servants, and they again the assistance  and guidance of the first, as their Master and Director; but both these  Receptacles, tho' inferior to the first, were nevertheless superior to  all those Members which were form'd afterwards. The first Receptacle, by  the power of that Spirit which was joyn'd to it and its continual  flaming Heat, was form'd into a Conical figure, like that of Fire, and  by this means that thick Body, which was about it, became of the same  figure, being solid Flesh cover'd with a thick Membrane. This is what we  call the Heart. Now considering the great expence of Moisture, which  must needs be where there is so much Heat, 'twas absolutely necessary,  that there should be some part form'd, whose Office it should be  continually to supply this defect; Otherwise it would have been  impossible to have subsisted long. 'Twas also necessary that [this  forming Spirit] should have a Sense both of what was convenient for him,  and what was hurtful, and accordingly attract the one and repel the  other. For these Services there were two parts form'd, with their  respective Faculties, _viz_. the Brain and the Liver: the first of these  presided over all things relating to Sense, the latter over such things  as belong'd to Nutrition: both of these depended upon the Heart for a  supply of Heat, and the recruiting of their proper Faculties. To  establish a good Correspondence between all these, there were Ducts and  Passages interwoven, some bigger, some lesser, according as necessity  requir'd; and these are the Arteries and Veins.    Thus much for a Taste; they that tell the Story go on farther, and give  you a particular account of the Formation of all the parts, as the  Physicians do of the Formation of the _Foetus_ in the Womb, omitting  nothing till he was compleatly form'd, and just like an _Embryo_ ready  for the Birth. In this account they are forc'd to be beholding to this  vast Mass of Earth, which you are to suppose was of a most exact  mixture, and contain'd in it all manner of materials proper for the  making Man's Body, and those Skins, _&c._ which cover it; till at last,  when he was Compleat in all his parts, as if the Mass had been in  labour, those Coverings, which he was wrapp'd up in, burst asunder, and  the rest of the Dirt dry-d and crack'd in pieces. The Infant being thus  brought into the World, and finding his Nourishment fail him, cry'd for  want of Victuals, till the _Roe_ which had lost her Fawn heard him. Now,  both those who are of the other Opinion and those who are for this kind  of generation, agree in all the other particulars of his Education: and  what they tell us is this.    Sec. 10. They say that this _Roe_ liv'd in good Pasture so that she was  fat, and had, such plenty of Milk, that she was very well able to  maintain the Child; she took great care of him, and never left him, but  when hunger forc'd her: and he grew so well acquainted with her, that if  at any time she staid away from him a little longer than ordinary, he'd  cry pitifully, and she, as soon as she heard him, came running  instantly; besides all this, he enjoy'd this happiness, that there was  no Beast of prey in the whole Island.    Sec. 11. Thus he went on, Living only upon what he Suck'd till he was Two  Years Old, and then he began to step a little and Breed his Teeth. He  always followed the _Roe_ and she shew'd all the tenderness to him  imaginable; and us'd to carry him to places where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#6)"],[1," that the poor could  fill it with a gift of a few flowers, whereas the rich cast in myriads  of bushels and found there was still room for more. A few years later  Fa-Hsien heard a sermon in Ceylon[62] in which the preacher predicted  that the bowl would be taken in the course of centuries to Central  Asia, China, Ceylon and Central India whence it would ultimately  ascend to the Tusita heaven for the use of the future Buddha. Later  accounts to some extent record the fulfilment of these predictions  inasmuch as they relate how the bowl (or bowls) passed from land to  land but the story of its wandering may have little foundation since  it is combined with the idea that it is wafted from shrine to shrine  according as the faith is nourishing or decadent. Hsuan Chuang says  that it \"had gone on from Peshawar to several countries and was  now in Persia.\"[63] A Mohammedan legend relates that it is at Kandahar  and will contain any quantity of liquid without overflowing. Marco  Polo says Kublai Khan sent an embassy in 1284 to bring it from Ceylon  to China.[64]    The wanderings of the tooth, though almost as surprising as those of  the bowl, rest on better historical evidence, but there is probably  more continuity in the story than in the holy object of which it is  related, for the piece of bone which is credited with being the left  canine tooth of the Blessed One may have been changed on more than one  occasion. The Sinhalese chronicles,[65] as mentioned, say that it was  brought to Ceylon in the ninth year of Sirimeghavanna.[66] This  date may be approximately correct for about 413 or later Fa-Hsien  described the annual festival of the tooth, during which it was  exposed for veneration at the Abhayagiri monastery, without indicating  that the usage was recent.    The tooth did not, according to Sinhalese tradition, form part of the  relics distributed after the cremation of the Buddha. Seven bones,  including four teeth,[67] were excepted from that distribution and  the Sage Khema taking the left canine tooth direct from the funeral  pyre gave it to the king of Kalinga, who enshrined it in a gorgeous  temple at Dantapura[68] where it is supposed to have remained 800  years. At the end of that period a pious king named Guhasiva  became involved in disastrous wars on account of the relic, and, as  the best means of preserving it, bade his daughter fly with her  husband[69] and take it to Ceylon. This, after some miraculous  adventures, they were able to do. The tooth was received with great  ceremony and lodged in an edifice called the Dhammacakka from which it  was taken every year for a temporary sojourn[70] in the Abhayagiri  monastery.    The cultus of the tooth flourished exceedingly in the next few  centuries and it came to be regarded as the talisman of the king and  nation. Hence when the court moved from Anuradhapura to Pollunaruwa it  was installed in the new capital. In the troubled times which followed  it changed its residence some fifteen times. Early in the fourteenth  century it was carried off by the Tamils to southern India but was  recovered by Parakrama Bahu III and during the commotion created by  the invasions of the Tamils, Chinese and Portuguese it was hidden in  various cities. In 1560 Dom Constantino de Braganca, Portuguese  Viceroy of Goa, led a crusade against Jaffna to avenge the alleged  persecution of Christians, and when the town was sacked a relic,  described as the tooth of an ape mounted in gold, was found in a  temple and carried off to Goa. On this Bayin Naung, King of Pegu,  offered an enormous ransom to redeem it, which the secular government  wished to accept, but the clergy and inquisition put such pressure on  the Viceroy that he rejected the proposal. The archbishop of Goa  pounded the tooth in a mortar before the viceregal court, burned the  fragments and scattered the ashes over the sea.[71]    But the singular result of this bigotry was not to destroy one sacred  tooth but to create two. The king of Pegu, who wished to marry a  Sinhalese princess, sent an embassy to Ceylon to arrange the match.  They were received by the king of Cotta, who bore the curiously  combined name of Don Juan Dharmapala. He had no daughter of his own  but palmed off the daughter of a chamberlain. At the same time he  informed the king of Pegu that the tooth destroyed at Goa was not  the real relic and that this still remained in his possession. Bayin  Naung was induced to marry the lady and received the tooth with  appropriate ceremonies. But when the king of Kandy heard of these  doings, he apprized the king of Pegu of the double trick that had been  played on him. He offered him his own daughter, a veritable princess,  in marriage and as her dowry the true tooth which, he said, was  neither that destroyed at Goa nor yet that sent to Pegu, but one in  his own possession. Bayin Naung received the Kandyan embassy politely  but rejected its proposals, thinking no doubt that it would be awkward  to declare the first tooth spurious after it had been solemnly  installed as a sacred relic. The second tooth therefore remained in  Kandy and appears to be that now venerated there. When Vimala Dharma  re-established the original line of kings, about 1592, it was accepted  as authentic.    As to its authenticity, it appears to be beyond doubt that it is a  piece of discoloured bone about two inches long, which could never  have been the tooth of an ordinary human being, so that even the  faithful can only contend that the Buddha was of superhuman stature.  Whether it is the relic which was venerated in Ceylon before the  arrival of the Portuguese is a more difficult question, for it may be  argued with equal plausibility that the Sinhalese had good reasons for  hiding the real tooth and good reasons for duplicating it. The  strongest argument against the authenticity of the relic destroyed by  the Portuguese is that it was found in Jaffna, which had long been a  Tamil town, whereas there is no reason to believe that the real tooth  was at this time in Tamil custody. But, although the native  literature always speaks of it as unique, the Sinhalese appear to have  produced replicas more than once, for we hear of such being sent to  Burma and China.[72] Again, the offer to ransom the tooth came not  from Ceylon but from the king of Pegu, who, as the sequel shows, was  gullible in such matters: the Portuguese clearly thought that they had  acquired a relic of primary importance; on any hypothesis one of the  kings of Ceylon must have deceived the king of Pegu, and finally  Vimala Dharma had the strongest political reasons for accepting as  genuine the relic kept at Kandy, since the possession of the true  tooth went far to substantiate a Sinhalese monarch's right to the  throne.    The tooth is now preserved in a temple at Kandy. The visitor looking  through a screen of bars can see on a silver table a large jewelled  case shaped like a bell. Flowers scattered on the floor or piled on  other tables fill the chamber with their heavy perfume. Inside the  bell are six other bells of diminishing size, the innermost of which  covers a golden lotus containing the sacred tooth. But it is only on  rare occasions that the outer caskets are removed. Worshippers as a  rule have to content themselves with offering flowers[73] and bowing  but I was informed that the priests celebrate _puja_ daily before the  relic. The ceremony comprises the consecration and distribution of  rice and is interesting as connecting the veneration of the tooth with  the ritual observed in Hindu temples. But we must return to the  general history of Buddhism in Ceylon.    3      The kings who ruled in the fifth century were devout Buddhists and  builders of viharas but the most important event of this period, not  merely for the island but for the whole Buddhist church in the south,  was the literary activity of Buddhaghosa who is said to have resided  in Ceylon during the reign of Mahanama. The chief authorities for his  life are a passage in the continuation of the Mahavamsa[74] and the  Buddhaghosuppatti, a late Burmese text of about 1550, which, while  adding many anecdotes, appears not to come from an independent  source.[75] The gist of their account is that he was born in a Brahman  family near Gaya and early obtained renown as a disputant. He was  converted to Buddhism by a monk named Revata and began to write  theological treatises.[76] Revata observing his intention to  compose a commentary on the Pitakas, told him that only the text  (palimattam) of the scriptures was to be found in India, not the  ancient commentaries, but that the Sinhalese commentaries were  genuine, having been composed in that language by Mahinda. He  therefore bade Buddhaghosa repair to Ceylon and translate these  Sinhalese works into the idiom of Magadha, by which Pali must be  meant. Buddhaghosa took this advice and there is no reason to distrust  the statement of the Mahavamsa that he arrived in the reign of  Mahanama, who ruled according to Geiger from 458 to 480, though the  usual reckoning places him about fifty years earlier. The fact that  Fa-Hsien, who visited Ceylon about 412, does not mention Buddhaghosa  is in favour of Geiger's chronology.[77]    He first studied in the Mahavihara and eventually requested permission  to translate the Sinhalese commentaries. To prove his competence for  the task he composed the celebrated Visuddhi-magga, and, this being  considered satisfactory, he took up his residence in the Ganthakara  Vihara and proceeded to the work of translation. When it was finished  he returned to India or according to the Talaing tradition to Thaton.  The Buddhaghosuppatti adds two stories of which the truth and meaning  are equally doubtful. They are that Buddhaghosa burnt the works  written by Mahinda and that his knowledge of Sanskrit was called in  question but triumphantly proved. Can there be here any allusion to a"]]]
