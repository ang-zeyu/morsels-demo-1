He carried a light-coloured  umbrella to protect his head.    \"He'll want something more than that, though!\" Jones laughed quietly to  himself when he saw him enter.    The pistol was safely in his hip pocket, every one of its six chambers  loaded.    The Manager saw the smile on his face, and gave him a long steady look  as he sat down to his desk in the corner. A few minutes later he touched  the bell for the head cashier--a single ring--and then asked Jones to  fetch some papers from another safe in the room upstairs.    A deep inner trembling seized the secretary as he noticed these  precautions, for he saw that the hostile forces were at work against  him, and yet he felt he could delay no longer and must act that very  morning, interference or no interference. However, he went obediently up  in the lift to the next floor, and while fumbling with the combination  of the safe, known only to himself, the cashier, and the Manager, he  again heard Thorpe's horrid whisper just behind him:    \"You must do it to-day! You must do it to-day!\"    He came down again with the papers, and found the Manager alone. The  room was like a furnace, and a wave of dead heated air met him in the  face as he went in. The moment he passed the doorway he realised that he  had been the subject of conversation between the head cashier and his  enemy. They had been discussing him. Perhaps an inkling of his secret  had somehow got into their minds. They had been watching him for days  past. They had become suspicious.    Clearly, he must act now, or let the opportunity slip by perhaps for  ever. He heard Thorpe's voice in his ear, but this time it was no mere  whisper, but a plain human voice, speaking out loud.    \"Now!\" it said. \"Do it now!\"    The room was empty. Only the Manager and himself were in it.    Jones turned from his desk where he had been standing, and locked the  door leading into the main office. He saw the army of clerks scribbling  in their shirt-sleeves, for the upper half of the door was of glass. He  had perfect control of himself, and his heart was beating steadily.    The Manager, hearing the key turn in the lock, looked up sharply.    \"What's that you're doing?\" he asked quickly.    \"Only locking the door, sir,\" replied the secretary in a quite even  voice.    \"Why? Who told you to--?\"    \"The voice of Justice, sir,\" replied Jones, looking steadily into the  hated face.    The Manager looked black for a moment, and stared angrily across the  room at him. Then suddenly his expression changed as he stared, and he  tried to smile. It was meant to be a kind smile evidently, but it only  succeeded in being frightened.    \"That _is_ a good idea in this weather,\" he said lightly, \"but it would  be much better to lock it on the _outside_, wouldn't it, Mr. Jones?\"    \"I think not, sir. You might escape me then. Now you can't.\"    Jones took his pistol out and pointed it at the other's face. Down the  barrel he saw the features of the tall dark man, evil and sinister. Then  the outline trembled a little and the face of the Manager slipped back  into its place. It was white as death, and shining with perspiration.    \"You tortured me to death four hundred years ago,\" said the clerk in the  same steady voice, \"and now the dispensers of justice have chosen me to  punish you.\"    The Manager's face turned to flame, and then back to chalk again. He  made a quick movement towards the telephone bell, stretching out a hand  to reach it, but at the same moment Jones pulled the trigger and the  wrist was shattered, splashing the wall behind with blood.    \"That's _one_ place where the chains burnt,\" he said quietly to himself.  His hand was absolutely steady, and he felt that he was a hero.    The Manager was on his feet, with a scream of pain, supporting himself  with his right hand on the desk in front of him, but Jones pressed the  trigger again, and a bullet flew into the other wrist, so that the big  man, deprived of support, fell forward with a crash on to the desk.    \"You damned madman!\" shrieked the Manager. \"Drop that pistol!\"    \"That's _another_ place,\" was all Jones said, still taking careful aim  for another shot.    The big man, screaming and blundering, scrambled beneath the desk,  making frantic efforts to hide, but the secretary took a step forward  and fired two shots in quick succession into his projecting legs,  hitting first one ankle and then the other, and smashing them horribly.    \"Two more places where the chains burnt,\" he said, going a little  nearer.    The Manager, still shrieking, tried desperately to squeeze his bulk  behind the shelter of the opening beneath the desk, but he was far too  large, and his bald head protruded through on the other side. Jones  caught him by the scruff of his great neck and dragged him yelping out  on to the carpet. He was covered with blood, and flopped helplessly upon  his broken wrists.    \"Be quick now!\" cried the voice of Thorpe.    There was a tremendous commotion and banging at the door, and Jones  gripped his pistol tightly. Something seemed to crash through his brain,  clearing it for a second, so that he thought he saw beside him a great  veiled figure, with drawn sword and flaming eyes, and sternly approving  attitude.    \"Remember the eyes! Remember the eyes!\" hissed Thorpe in the air above  him.    Jones felt like a god, with a god's power. Vengeance disappeared from  his mind. He was acting impersonally as an instrument in the hands of  the Invisibles who dispense justice and balance accounts. He bent down  and put the barrel close into the other's face, smiling a little as he  saw the childish efforts of the arms to cover his head. Then he pulled  the trigger, and a bullet went straight into the right eye, blackening  the skin. Moving the pistol two inches the other way, he sent another  bullet crashing into the left eye. Then he stood upright over his victim  with a deep sigh of satisfaction.    The Manager wriggled convulsively for the space of a single second, and  then lay still in death.    There was not a moment to lose, for the door was already broken in and  violent hands were at his neck. Jones put the pistol to his temple and  once more pressed the trigger with his finger.    But this time there was no report. Only a little dead click answered the  pressure, for the secretary had forgotten that the pistol had only six  chambers, and that he had used them all. He threw the useless weapon  on to the floor, laughing a little out loud, and turned, without a  struggle, to give himself up.    \"I _had_ to do it,\" he said quietly, while they tied him. \"It was simply  my duty! And now I am ready to face the consequences, and Thorpe will be  proud of me. For justice has been done and the gods are satisfied.\"    He made not the slightest resistance, and when the two policemen marched  him off through the crowd of shuddering little clerks in the office, he  again saw the veiled figure moving majestically in front of him, making  slow sweeping circles with the flaming sword, to keep back the host of  faces that were thronging in upon him from the Other Region.             *       *       *       *       *          _The Man Who Found Out_    (A Nightmare)    1      Professor Mark Ebor, the scientist, led a double life, and the only  persons who knew it were his assistant, Dr. Laidlaw, and his publishers.  But a double life need not always be a bad one, and, as Dr. Laidlaw and  the gratified publishers well knew, the parallel lives of this  particular man were equally good, and indefinitely produced would  certainly have ended in a heaven somewhere that can suitably contain  such strangely opposite characteristics as his remarkable personality  combined.    For Mark Ebor, F.R.S., etc., etc., was that unique combination hardly  ever met with in actual life, a man of science and a mystic.    As the first, his name stood in the gallery of the great, and as the  second--but there came the mystery! For under the pseudonym of \"Pilgrim\"  (the author of that brilliant series of books that appealed to so many),  his identity was as well concealed as that of the anonymous writer of  the weather reports in a daily newspaper. Thousands read the sanguine,  optimistic, stimulating little books that issued annually from the pen  of \"Pilgrim,\" and thousands bore their daily burdens better for having  read; while the Press generally agreed that the author, besides being an  incorrigible enthusiast and optimist, was also--a woman; but no one ever  succeeded in penetrating the veil of anonymity and discovering that  \"Pilgrim\" and the biologist were one and the same person.    Mark Ebor, as Dr. Laidlaw knew him in his laboratory, was one man; but  Mark Ebor, as he sometimes saw him after work was over, with rapt eyes  and ecstatic face, discussing the possibilities of \"union with God\" and  the future of the human race, was quite another.    \"I have always held, as you know,\" he was saying one evening as he  sat in the little study beyond the laboratory with his assistant and  intimate, \"that Vision should play a large part in the life of the  awakened man--not to be regarded as infallible, of course, but to be  observed and made use of as a guide-post to possibilities--\"    \"I am aware of your peculiar views, sir,\" the young doctor put in  deferentially, yet with a certain impatience.    \"For Visions come from a region of the consciousness where observation  and experiment are out of the question,\" pursued the other with  enthusiasm, not noticing the interruption, \"and, while they should be  checked by reason afterwards, they should not be laughed at or ignored.  All inspiration, I hold, is of the nature of interior Vision, and all  our best knowledge has come--such is my confirmed belief--as a sudden  revelation to the brain prepared to receive it--\"    \"Prepared by hard work first, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#6)"],[1,"arts.      Is it a plant?    No, it is an insect. The form of the Cochineal is oval; it is about  the size of a small pea, and has six legs armed with claws, and a  trunk by which it sucks its nourishment.      What is its habitation?    It breeds in a fruit resembling a pear; the plant which bears it is  about five or six feet high; at the top of the fruit grows a red  flower, which when full blown, falls upon it; the fruit then appears  full of little red insects, having very small wings. These are the  Cochineals.      How are they caught?    By spreading a cloth under the plant, and shaking it with poles, till  the insects quit it and fly about, which they cannot do many minutes,  but soon tumble down dead into the cloth; where they are left till  quite dry.      Does the insect change its color when it is dead?    When the insect flies, it is red; when it is fallen, black; and when  first dried, it is greyish; it afterwards changes to a purplish grey,  powdered over with a kind of white dust.      From what countries is the Cochineal brought?    From the West Indies, Jamaica, Mexico, and other parts of America.      What are Cloves?    The dried flower-buds of the Clove Tree, anciently a native of the  Moluccas; but afterwards transplanted by the Dutch (who traded in  them,) to other islands, particularly that of Ternate. It is now found  in most of the East Indian Islands.      Describe the Clove Tree.    It is a large handsome tree of the myrtle kind; its leaves resemble  those of the laurel. Though the Clove Tree is cultivated to a great  extent, yet, so easily does the fruit on falling take root, that it  thus multiplies itself, in many instances, without the trouble of  culture. The clove when it first begins to appear is white, then  green, and at last hard and red; when dried, it turns yellow, and then  dark brown.      What are its qualities?    The Clove is the hottest, and most acrid of aromatic substances; one  of our most wholesome spices, and of great use in medicine; it also  yields an abundance of oil, which is much used by perfumers, and in  medicine.         _Acrid_, of a hot, biting taste.         _Aromatic_, fragrant, having an agreeable odor.      What is Cinnamon?    An agreeable, aromatic spice, the bark of a tree of the laurel kind;  the Cinnamon tree grows in the Southern parts of India; but most  abundantly in the island of Ceylon, where it is extensively  cultivated; its flowers are white, resembling those of the lilac in  form, and are very fragrant; they are borne in large clusters. The  tree sends up numerous shoots the third or fourth year after it has  been planted; these shoots are planted out, when nearly an inch in  thickness.      How is the bark procured?    By stripping it off from these shoots, after they have been cut down;  the trees planted for the purpose of obtaining cinnamon, throw out a  great number of branches, apparently from the same root, and are not  allowed to rise higher than ten feet; but in its native uncultivated  state, the cinnamon tree usually rises to the height of twenty or  thirty feet.      How is the Cinnamon Tree cultivated?    By seed, sown during the rains; from shoots cut from large trees; and  by transplanting old stumps. The cinnamon tree, in its wild state, is  said to be propagated by means of a kind of pigeons, that feed on its  fruit; in carrying which to their nests, the seeds fall out, and,  dropping in various places, take root, spring up, and become trees.         _Propagated_, spread, extended, multiplied.      What else is obtained from this tree?    The bark, besides being used as a spice, yields an oil highly  esteemed, both as a medicine and as a perfume; the fruit by boiling  also produces an oil, used by the natives for burning in lamps; as  soon as it hardens, it becomes a solid substance like wax, and is  formed into candles. Camphor is extracted from the root. Cassia is  cinnamon of an inferior kind.          CHAPTER V.    BOMBAZINE, CRAPE, CAMLET, CAMBRIC, LACE, SILK, VELVET, AND  MOHAIR.      What is Bombazine?    A stuff composed of silk and wool woven together in a loom. It was  first made at Milan, and thence sent abroad; great quantities are now  made in England and other countries.      Where is Milan situated?    In Italy, and is noted for its cathedral.      For what is Bombazine used?    For dresses. Black bombazine is worn entirely for mourning. The  original bombazine has, however, become much less used than formerly,  on account of the numerous newly-invented fabrics of finer or coarser  qualities, composed of the same materials mixed in various degrees, as  Mousselines de laine, Challis, &c.      What is Crape?    A light, transparent stuff, resembling gauze, made of raw silk very  loosely woven, or of wool; by raw silk is meant, silk in the state in  which it is taken from the silk worm.      Where was Crape first made?    At Bologna, a city of Italy.      What city of France was long celebrated for its manufacture?    Lyons, the second city of France, where there are large silk  manufactories. Great quantities are also made in England, principally  in the city of Norwich, which has long been distinguished for the  beauty of its crapes.      What is Camlet?    A stuff made sometimes of wool, sometimes of silk and hair, especially  that of goats. The oriental camlet is made of the pure hair of a sort  of goat, a native of Angora, a city of Natolia, in Turkey. The  European camlets are made of a mixture of woollen thread and hair.      What countries are most noted for them?    England, France, Holland, and Flanders; the city of Brussels, in  Belgium, exceeds them all in the beauty and quality of its camlets;  those of England are the next.      What is Cambric?    A species of linen made of flax; it is very fine and white.      From whence did it take its name?    From Cambray, a large and celebrated city of French Flanders, where it  was first made; it is now made at other places in France; and also in  England, Scotland, Ireland, the United States, &c.      What is Lace?    A work composed of many threads of fine linen or silk, interwoven one  with another according to some particular pattern. Belgium, France,  and England are the principal countries in which this manufacture is  carried on; vast quantities of the finest laces were formerly made in  Flanders.      From what is Silk produced?    From the silk-worm, an insect not more remarkable for the precious  matter it furnishes, than for the many forms it assumes before and  after it envelopes itself in the beautiful ball, the silken threads of  which form the elegant texture which is so much worn.         _Texture_, a web or substance woven.      What are the habits of this insect, and on what does it feed?    After bursting from the egg, it becomes a large worm or caterpillar of  a yellowish white color, (which is its first state;) this caterpillar  feeds on the leaves of the mulberry tree, till, arriving at maturity,  it winds itself up in a silken bag or case, called a cocoon, about the  size and shape of a pigeon's egg, and becomes a chrysalis; in which  state it lies without signs of life; in about ten days it eats its way  out of its case, a perfect butterfly, which lays a number of eggs and  then dies. In the warmth of the summer weather, these eggs are  hatched, and become worms, as their parents did at first.         _Maturity_, ripeness, perfection      How much silk is each ball said to contain?    Each ball consists of a very fine, soft, bright, delicate thread,  which being wound off, extends in length six miles.      What is meant by Chrysalis?    The second state into which the insect passes before it comes to be a  butterfly. The maggot or worm having ceased to eat, fixes itself in  some place till its skin separates, and discovers a horny, oblong  body, which is the chrysalis.      Where was Silk first made?    The culture and manufacture of silk was originally confined to China.  The Greeks, under Alexander the Great, brought home, among other  Eastern luxuries, wrought silks from Persia, about 323, B.C.  It was not long unknown to the Romans, although it was so rare, that  it was even sold weight for weight with gold. The Emperor Aurelian,  who died in 275, B.C. refused the Empress, his wife, a suit  of silk which she solicited with much earnestness, merely on account  of its dearness. Heliogabalus, the Emperor, who died half a century  before Aurelian, was the first who wore a _holosericum_ or garment all  of silk.      Who introduced the Silk Worm itself into Europe?    Two monks, engaged as missionaries in China, obtained a quantity of  silk worms' eggs, which they concealed in a hollow cane, and conveyed  in safety to Constantinople in 552; the eggs were hatched in the  proper season by the warmth of manure, and the worms fed with the  leaves of the wild mulberry tree. These worms in due time spun their  silk, and propagated under the care of the monks, who also instructed  the Romans in the whole process of manufacturing their production.  From the insects thus produced, proceeded all the silk worms which  have since been reared in Europe, and the western parts of Asia. The  mulberry tree was then eagerly planted, and on this, their natural  food, they were successfully reared in Greece; and the manufacture was  established at Thebes, Athens, and Corinth, in particular. The  Venetians, soon after this time commencing a trade with the Greeks,  supplied all the Western parts of Europe with silks for many  centuries.      Where were the cities of Thebes and Athens situated?    Thebes was an ancient city of Beotia, in Greece, founded by Cadmus, a  Phenician, though of Egyptian parentage. Sailing from the coast of  Phenicia, he arrived in Beotia, and built the city, calling it Thebes,  from the city of that name in Egypt. To this prince is ascribed the  invention of sixteen letters of the Greek Alphabet. Athens was the"]]]
