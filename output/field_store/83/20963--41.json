It developed slower than sculpture perhaps; but were there  anything of importance left to judge from, we should probably find  that it developed in much the same manner as sculpture. Down to 500  B.C. there was little more than outline filled in with flat  monochromatic paint and with a decorative effect similar, perhaps, to  that of the vase paintings. After that date come the more important  names of artists mentioned by the ancient writers. It is difficult to  assign these artists to certain periods or schools, owing to the  insufficient knowledge we have about them. The following  classifications and assignments may, therefore, in some instances, be  questioned.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--MUSE OF CORTONA, CORTONA MUSEUM.]    OLDER ATTIC SCHOOL: The first painter of rank was Polygnotus (fl.  475-455 B.C.), sometimes called the founder of Greek painting, because  perhaps he was one of the first important painters in Greece proper.  He seems to have been a good outline draughtsman, producing figures in  profile, with little attempt at relief, perspective, or  light-and-shade. His colors were local tones, but probably more like  nature and more varied than anything in Egyptian painting. Landscapes,  buildings, and the like, were given in a symbolic manner. Portraiture  was a generalization, and in figure compositions the names of the  principal characters were written near them for purposes of  identification. The most important works of Polygnotus were the wall  paintings for the Assembly Room of the Knidians at Delphi. The  subjects related to the Trojan War and the adventures of Ulysses.    Opposed to this flat, unrelieved style was the work of a follower,  Agatharchos of Samos (fl. end of fifth century B.C.). He was a  scene-painter, and by the necessities of his craft was led toward  nature. Stage effect required a study of perspective, variation of  light, and a knowledge of the laws of optics. The slight outline  drawing of his predecessor was probably superseded by effective masses  to create illusion. This was a distinct advance toward nature.  Apollodorus (fl. end of fifth century B.C.) applied the principles of  Agatharchos to figures. According to Plutarch, he was the first to  discover variation in the shade of colors, and, according to Pliny,  the first master to paint objects as they appeared in nature. He had  the title of _skiagraphos_ (shadow-painter), and possibly gave a  semi-natural background with perspective. This was an improvement, but  not a perfection. It is not likely that the backgrounds were other  than conventional settings for the figure. Even these were not at once  accepted by the painters of the period, but were turned to profit in  the hands of the followers.    After the Peloponnesian Wars the art of painting seems to have  flourished elsewhere than in Athens, owing to the Athenian loss of  supremacy. Other schools sprang up in various districts, and one to  call for considerable mention by the ancient writers was the    IONIAN SCHOOL, which in reality had existed from the sixth century.  The painters of this school advanced upon the work of Apollodorus as  regards realistic effect. Zeuxis, whose fame was at its height during  the Peloponnesian Wars, seems to have regarded art as a matter of  illusion, if one may judge by the stories told of his work. The tale  of his painting a bunch of grapes so like reality that the birds came  to peck at them proves either that the painter's motive was deception,  or that the narrator of the tale picked out the deceptive part of his  picture for admiration. He painted many subjects, like Helen,  Penelope, and many _genre_ pieces on panel. Quintilian says he  originated light-and-shade, an achievement credited by Plutarch to  Apollodorus. It is probable that he advanced light-and-shade.    In illusion he seems to have been outdone by a rival, Parrhasios of  Ephesus. Zeuxis deceived the birds with painted grapes, but Parrhasios  deceived Zeuxis with a painted curtain. There must have been knowledge  of color, modelling, and relief to have produced such an illusion, but  the aim was petty and unworthy of the skill. There was evidently an  advance technically, but some decline in the true spirit of art.  Parrhasios finally suffered defeat at the hands of Timanthes of  Kythnos, by a Contest between Ajax and Ulysses for the Arms of  Achilles. Timanthes's famous work was the Sacrifice of Iphigenia, of  which there is a supposed Pompeian copy.    SIKYONIAN SCHOOL: This school seems to have sprung up after the  Peloponnesian Wars, and was perhaps founded by Eupompos, a  contemporary of Parrhasios. His pupil Pamphilos brought the school to  maturity. He apparently reacted from the deception motive of Zeuxis  and Parrhasios, and taught academic methods of drawing, composing, and  painting. He was also credited with bringing into use the encaustic  method of painting, though it was probably known before his time. His  pupil, Pausias, possessed some freedom of creation in _genre_ and  still-life subjects. Pliny says he had great technical skill, as shown  in the foreshortening of a black ox by variations of the black tones,  and he obtained some fame by a figure of Methe (Intoxication) drinking  from a glass, the face being seen through the glass. Again the  motives seem trifling, but again advancing technical power is shown.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--ODYSSEY LANDSCAPE, VATICAN. (FROM WOLTMANN AND  WOERMANN.)]    THEBAN-ATTIC SCHOOL: This was the fourth school of Greek painting.  Nikomachus (fl. about 360 B.C.), a facile painter, was at its head.  His pupil, Aristides, painted pathetic scenes, and was perhaps as  remarkable for teaching art to the celebrated Euphranor (fl. 360 B.C.)  as for his own productions. Euphranor had great versatility in the  arts, and in painting was renowned for his pictures of the Olympian  gods at Athens. His successor, Nikias (fl. 340-300 B.C.), was a  contemporary of Praxiteles, the sculptor, and was possibly influenced  by him in the painting of female figures. He was a technician of  ability in composition, light-and-shade, and relief, and was praised  for the roundness of his figures. He also did some tinting of  sculpture, and is said to have tinted some of the works of  Praxiteles.    LATE PAINTERS: Contemporary with and following these last-named  artists were some celebrated painters who really belong to the  beginning of the Hellenistic Period (323 B.C.). At their head was  Apelles, the painter of Philip and Alexander, and the climax of Greek  painting. He painted many gods, heroes, and allegories, with much  \"gracefulness,\" as Pliny puts it. The Italian Botticelli, seventeen  hundred years after him, tried to reproduce his celebrated Calumny,  from Lucian's description of it. His chief works were his Aphrodite  Anadyomene, carried to Rome by Augustus, and the portrait of Alexander  with the Thunder-bolt. He was undoubtedly a superior man technically.  Protogenes rivalled him, if we are to believe Petronius, by the foam  on a dog's mouth and the wonder in the eye of a startled pheasant.  Aetion, the painter of Alexander's Marriage to Roxana, was not able to  turn the aim of painting from this deceptive illusion. After  Alexander, painting passed still further into the imitative and the  theatrical, and when not grandiloquent was infinitely little over  cobbler-shops and huckster-stalls. Landscape for purposes of  decorative composition, and floor painting, done in mosaic, came in  during the time of the Diadochi. There were no great names in the  latter days, and such painters as still flourished passed on to Rome,  there to produce copies of the works of their predecessors.    It is hard to reconcile the unworthy motive attributed to Greek  painting by the ancient writers with the high aim of Greek sculpture.  It is easier to think (and it is more probable) that the writers knew  very little about art, and that they missed the spirit of Greek  painting in admiring its insignificant details. That painting  technically was at a high point of perfection as regards the figure,  even the imitative Roman works indicate, and it can hardly be doubted  that in spirit it was at one time equally strong.         EXTANT REMAINS: There are few wall or panel pictures of       Greek times in existence. Four slabs of stone in the Naples       Museum, with red outline drawings of Theseus, Silenos, and       some figures with masks, are probably Greek work from which       the color has scaled. A number of Roman copies of Greek       frescos and mosaics are in the Vatican, Capitoline, and       Naples Museums. All these pieces show an imitation of late       Hellenistic art--not the best period of Greek development.         THE VASES: The history of Greek painting in its remains is       traced with some accuracy in the decorative figures upon the       vases. The first ware--dating before the seventh century       B.C.--seems free from oriental influences in its designs.       The vase is reddish, the decoration is in tiers, bands, or       zig-zags, usually in black or brown, without the human       figure. The second kind of ware dates from about the middle       of the seventh century. It shows meander, wave, and other       designs, and is called the \"geometrical\" style. Later on       animals, rosettes, and vegetation appear that show Assyrian       influence. The decoration is profuse and the rude human       figure subordinate to it. The design is in black or       dark-brown, on a cream-colored slip. The third kind of ware       is the archaic or \"strong\" style. It dates from 500 B.C. to       the Peloponnesian Wars, and is marked by black figures upon       a yellow or red ground. White and purple are also used to       define flesh, hair, and white objects. The figure is stiff,       the action awkward, the composition is freer than before,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#6)"],[1,"     *       *        CHRISTMAS SONG        EDMUND HAMILTON SEARS        Calm on the listening ear of night        Come heaven's melodious strains,      Where wild Judea stretches far        Her silver-mantled plains;      Celestial choirs from courts above        Shed sacred glories there;      And angels with their sparkling lyres        Make music on the air.        The answering hills of Palestine        Send back the glad reply,      And greet from all their holy heights        The day-spring from on high:      O'er the blue depths of Galilee        There comes a holier calm,      And Sharon waves, in solemn praise,        Her silent groves of palm.        \"Glory to God!\" The lofty strain        The realm of ether fills:      How sweeps the song of solemn joy        O'er Judah's sacred hills!      \"Glory to God!\" The sounding skies        Loud with their anthems ring;      \"Peace on the earth; good-will to men,        From heaven's eternal King!\"        Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!

The Son of God, th' eternal king,      That did us all salvation bring,        And freed the soul from danger;      He whom the whole world could not take,      The Word, which heaven and earth did make,        Was now laid in a manger.        The Father's wisdom willed it so,      The Son's obedience knew no No,        Both wills were in one stature;      And as that wisdom had decreed,      The Word was now made flesh indeed,        And took on him our nature.

Tunes can we hear, but not the singers see,      The tunes divine, and so the singers be.            Lo, how the firmament            Within an azure fold          The flock of stars hath pent,            That we might them behold,      Yet from their beams proceedeth not this light,        Nor can their crystals such reflection give.

For each mount and vale and plain        Felt the touch of holier feet.      Then the gleaners of the grain        Heard, in voices full and sweet,      \"Peace on earth, good will to men,\"        Ring from angel lips afar,      While, o'er every glade and glen,        Broke the light of Bethlehem's star.        Star of hope to souls in night,        Star of peace above our strife,      Guiding, where the gates of death      Ope to fields of endless life.      Wanderer from the nightly throng        Which the eastern heavens gem;      Guided, by an angel's song,        To the Babe of Bethlehem.        Not Judea's hills alone        Have earth's weary gleaners trod,      Not to heirs of David's throne      Is it given to \"reign with God.\"      But where'er on His green earth        Heavenly faith and longing are,      Heavenly hope and life have birth,        'Neath the smile of Bethlehem's star.        In each lowly heart or home,        By each love-watched cradle-bed,      Where we rest, or where we roam,        Still its changeless light is shed.      In its beams each quickened heart,        Howe'er saddened or denied,      Keeps one little place apart        For the Hebrew mother's Child.        And that inner temple fair        May be holier ground than this,      Hallowed by the pilgrim's prayer,        Warmed by many a pilgrim's kiss.      In its shadow still and dim,        Where our holiest longings are,      Rings forever Bethlehem's hymn,        Shines forever Bethlehem's star.           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS DAY        CHARLES WESLEY        Hark! the herald angels sing      Glory to the new-born King!

Mary was that mother mild,      Jesus Christ that little child.        He came down to earth from Heaven,        Who is God and Lord of all.      And his shelter was a stable,        And his cradle was a stall.      With the poor and mean and lowly,      Lived on earth our Saviour Holy.
