BREAD GRIDDLE CAKES    Try these cakes some morning when the folks are tired of the usual  breakfast dishes. Place in a pitcher overnight      Two cups of buttermilk or sour milk,    One cup of water,    Two cups of bread crumbs.    Let stand in the kitchen in a cool place. Do not put in the icebox. In  the morning add      One teaspoonful baking soda    dissolved in      Three tablespoonfuls of water.    Beat to thoroughly mix and then add      Two tablespoonfuls syrup,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening,    One teaspoonful salt,    One and one-half cups flour,    Two teaspoonfuls baking powder.    Beat hard to mix and then bake on a hot griddle.      CORNMEAL GRIDDLE CAKES    Scald one cup of cornmeal with two cups of boiling water, and then let  cool. Now add      One and one-half cupfuls water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,    Three tablespoonfuls of syrup,    One teaspoonful of salt,    One-quarter yeast cake,    Two cupfuls flour,    One-quarter teaspoonful baking soda.    Beat hard and then let rise overnight; then prepare as for buckwheat  cakes.    Modern methods have eliminated the yeast and substituted baking  powder, thus making a quicker mix. To prepare buckwheat cakes with  baking powder, prepare a blend of flour as follows:      Two pounds of buckwheat,    One pound of wheat flour,    One cupful cornmeal,    One ounce of salt,    Three ounces of baking powder,    One-quarter ounce baking soda.    Sift three times to mix and then place in a dry container and use as  required.      HOW TO BAKE THE PANCAKE    Use a frying-pan that is perfectly flat; the iron ones are best, as  they hold the heat longer and can be regulated so that the cake will  not burn.      PANCAKES FOR TWO      Yolk of one egg,    Two tablespoonfuls sugar or syrup,    One cupful milk,    One tablespoonful shortening,    One teaspoonful salt,    One teaspoonful vanilla or nutmeg,    One and one-quarter cupfuls flour,    Two level teaspoonfuls baking powder.    Place in a bowl. Beat with a Dover egg-beater to thoroughly mix and  then fold in the stiffly beaten white of egg. Pour the mixture into  a pitcher and then place two tablespoonfuls of shortening in a frying  pan. When smoking hot pour in just sufficient batter to cover the  bottom of the pan. When it begins to bubble turn the cake over and  bake on the other side. Lift and spread lightly with jelly or roll, or  use the following mixture:      Three tablespoonfuls butter,    One-half cupful of XXXX sugar,    Cream well, and then add      One tablespoonful lemon juice,    One tablespoon boiling water.    Beat to blend.      PLAIN PANCAKES    Place in a bowl one quart of milk and then add      Two eggs,    One-half teaspoonful nutmeg,    Five cupfuls sifted flour,    Four tablespoonfuls syrup,    Five level teaspoonfuls baking powder.    Beat to mix and then bake. To insure sufficient cakes use two pans for  cooking or bake on a griddle.      PANCAKES AU FAIT      One cupful milk,    Two eggs,    One and one-half cupfuls flour,    Two teaspoonfuls baking powder,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening,    One-half teaspoonful nutmeg.    Beat to mix. Now prepare      One-half cupful of nuts, chopped very fine,    One dozen maraschino cherries, well-drained and chopped fine.    Mix well and then pour pancake in hot pan and sprinkle with the above  mixture.    Let bake and then lift. Spread with honey and dust with pulverized  sugar. Roll and garnish with maraschino cherry.      FRENCH PANCAKE      One egg,    One-quarter cupful milk.    Beat to mix and then add      One-half cupful flour,    One-half teaspoonful salt,    One teaspoonful baking powder.    Beat well to thoroughly mix and then pour in a hot pan containing  three tablespoonfuls of shortening: pour just enough to barely cover  the bottom of the pan. Cover the pan with a hot lid. Let the cake  bake. When ready to turn slip the cake on the hot lid and invert,  returning the cake to the pan. Spread with sugar and cinnamon. Bar le  duc or currant jelly may be used to spread on the cakes. Fold like an  omelet and place a spoonful of jelly on top. Serve. This will make two  large pancakes.      IRISH PANCAKES      One cupful mashed potatoes,    Two cupfuls flour,    One teaspoonful salt,    Three teaspoonfuls baking powder,    Two eggs,    One cupful milk,    Four tablespoonfuls syrup,    One and one-half teaspoonfuls nutmeg.    Beat to thoroughly mix and then bake on a griddle. Spread with butter  and sugar.      BELGIUM PANCAKES      Two cupfuls of unsweetened thin applesauce,    One well-beaten egg,    Three tablespoonfuls syrup,    Two and one-half cupfuls flour,    Three teaspoonfuls baking powder,    One tablespoonful shortening,    One-half teaspoonful cinnamon.    Beat to mix and then bake in the usual manner. Serve with butter and  syrup.      WAFFLES    Waffles are made from a thin batter and are baked in a well-heated  waffle iron. Many failures to make good waffles are due to the fact  that the iron is not sufficiently hot. The iron must be thoroughly  cleaned after each baking. Place the iron on the range to heat,  turning it several times.    Try this method in greasing the iron. Purchase a large-sized sewing  machine oil-can, wash well in plenty of hot water and soap, then rinse  thoroughly and dry. Now fill with a good salad oil and when the  iron is heated, oil it on both sides. Now you are ready to bake the  waffles. Reverse the iron, having the hot side on top, and pour in the  batter and then bake about three minutes, reversing the iron once.    When the waffles are baked remove from the iron and then oil and  reverse it again, putting the side that was next to the fire on top  and then pour in the batter, close and bake as before.      QUICK BREADS    Quick breads include griddle cakes, waffles, muffins, Sally Lunns,  shortcakes and biscuits. These doughs are made light or leavened  by the use of eggs, baking soda, baking powder and steam created  in baking and by air beaten into the mixture. Their entire success  depends upon the careful measurement of ingredients, the mixing and  the baking. Using all water in place of milk or equal parts of milk  and water will give splendid results.      GRIDDLE CAKES    Place the griddle on the range to heat slowly, while mixing the  batter.    Place in a bowl or a flat, wide-mouthed pitcher      One cupful milk,    One cupful water,    One teaspoonful salt,    One tablespoonful syrup,    Two and one-half cups of flour,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening,    Four level teaspoonfuls baking powder.    Beat to mix to a smooth batter. This amount of batter will make  hotcakes for four persons. For larger amounts, multiply. One egg may  be used for every two cupfuls of flour.    Test the griddle by dropping a few drops of water on it; if the water  boils, the griddle is sufficiently hot to bake with. Aluminum griddles  do not require any grease. Rub with a clean cloth dipped in salt.  Grease iron griddles slightly. Pour on the batter; just as soon as the  cakes begin to form air bubbles slip a cake-turner under the cakes and  turn them.    Now, if large bubbles rise at once to the top of the cakes, the  griddle is too hot and the heat should be reduced; while, if the cake  stiffens before the underside is brown the griddle is not hot enough.  Never turn a griddle cake twice--this makes them heavy. Serve them as  soon as baked, piling not more than five or six together. Sour milk  may be used in place of sweet milk. Discard the baking powder and use  one level teaspoonful of baking soda for each cup of sour milk. One  egg and two cupfuls of water may be used in place of two cupfuls of  milk.      WAFFLE BATTER      One cup of milk,    One cup of water,    One egg,    One teaspoonful of salt,    Two and one-quarter cupfuls flour,    Three teaspoonfuls baking powder,    One tablespoonful syrup,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening.    Beat to a smooth batter in a wide-mouthed pitcher. One-half of this  amount for two people.    Cold boiled rice, hominy, oatmeal and stale bread that has been soaked  in cold water and then pressed dry and rubbed through a sieve may be  added to the griddle cakes and waffle batters.      MUFFINS    Muffins are made from a drop batter and may be baked in rings, on a  griddle, in muffin pans or in custard cups. To bake the muffins in  rings on a griddle upon the top of the stove--grease the griddle well,  and also have the rings well greased. Put the griddle on to heat when  starting to mix the drop batter and keep the rings cool until ready to  bake.    Place in a bowl or pitcher      One and one-half cupfuls of milk or equal parts of milk and    water,    One egg,    One teaspoonful salt,    Two tablespoonfuls syrup,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening,    Two and three-quarters cupfuls flour,    Five level teaspoonfuls baking powder.    Beat this mixture smooth and then place the rings on a hot griddle and  half fill with the drop batter. When well risen and nearly dry, turn  over, using the griddle-cake turner to turn the muffins and rings.  Bake on the other side. It will require about eighteen minutes to bake  these muffins. Tear them apart, butter and serve them at once.    To bake muffins in pans or custard cups, grease the pans or cups well  and half fill with the drop batter and then bake in a hot oven for  fifteen minutes.      OATMEAL MUFFINS    Put two cups of oatmeal through the food chopper into the mixing bowl  and then add      One and one-half cups of sour milk,    One teaspoonful baking soda dissolved in one tablespoon of cold            water,    One-half teaspoon salt,    Four tablespoonfuls syrup,    Two tablespoonfuls shortening.    One cup of sifted flour.    Beat to mix and then pour into well-greased muffin pans and bake in a  hot oven for twenty minutes.
