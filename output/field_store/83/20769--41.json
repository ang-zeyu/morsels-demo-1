And at this giving up of the accounts, as the Doctors are to  declare what they think worthie to bee added to the common stock of  Learning, each in their Facultie; so I would have them see what the  Charges and Pains are whereat the Librarie-Keeper hath been, that for  his encouragement, the extraordinarie expences in correspondencies and  transcriptions for the publick good, may bee allowed him out of som  Revenues, which should bee set a part to that effect, and disposed of  according to their joint-content and judgment in that matter. Here then  hee should bee bound to shew them the Lists of his correspondents, the  Letters from them in Answer to his, and the reckoning of his  extraordinarie expence should bee allowed him in that which hee is  indebted, or hath freely laid out to procure Rarities into the stock of  Learning. And becaus I understand that all the Book-Printers or  Stationars of the Common-wealth are bound of everie Book which is  Printed, to send a Copie into the Universitie Librarie; and it is  impossible for one man to read all the Books in all Faculties, to judg  of them what worth there is in them; nor hath everie one Abilitie to  judg of all kinde of Sciences what everie Autor doth handle, and how  sufficiently; therefore I would have at this time of giving accounts,  the Librarie-keeper also bound to produce the Catalogue of all the Books  sent unto the Universitie's Librarie by the Stationars that Printed  them; to the end that everie one of the Doctors in their own Faculties  should declare, whether or no they should bee added, and where they  should bee placed in the Catalogue of Additionals; For I do not think  that all Books and Treaties which in this age are Printed in all kindes,  should bee inserted into the Catalogue, and added to the stock of the  Librarie, discretion must bee used and confusion avoided, and a cours  taken to distinguish that which is profitable, from that which is  useless; and according to the verdict of that Societie, the usefulness  of Books for the publick is to bee determined; yet becaus there is  seldom anie Books wherein there is not somthing useful, and Books freely  given are not to bee cast away, but may bee kept, therefore I would have  a peculiar place appointed for such Books as shall bee laid aside to  keep them in, and a Catalogue of their Titles made Alphabetically in  reference to the Autor's name, with a note of distinction to shew the  Science to which they are to bee referred. These thoughts com thus  suddenly into my head, which in due time may bee more fully described,  if need bee, chiefly if, upon the ground of this account, som  competencie should bee found out and allowed to maintein such charges as  will bee requisite, towards the advancement of the Publick good of  Learning after this manner.      The second Letter.    _Sir!_    In my last I gave you som incident thoughts, concerning the improvement  of an Honorarie Librarie-keeper's place, to shew the true end and use  thereof, and how the keepers thereof should bee regulated in the Trade,  which hee is to drive for the Advancement of Learning, and encouraged by  a competent maintenance, and supported in extraordinarie expences for  the same. Now I wish that som men of publick Spirits and lovers of  Learning, might bee made acquainted with the Action, upon such grounds  as were then briefly suggested; who know's but that in time somthing  might bee offered to the Trustees of the Nation, with better conceptions  then these I have suggested.    For, if it bee considered that amongst manie Eminencies of this Nation,  the Librarie of Oxford is one of the most considerable for the  advancement of Learning, if rightly improved and Traded withal for the  good of Scholars at home and abroad; If this (I saie) bee rightly  considered and represented to the publick Reformers of this age, that  by this means this Nation as in other things, so especially for Pietie  and Learning, and by the advancement of both, may now bee made more  glorious then anie other in the world; No doubt such as in the Parlament  know the worth of Learning will not bee avers from further overtures,  which may bee made towards this purpose. What a great stir hath been  heretofore, about the Eminencie of the Librarie of Heidelberg, but what  use was made of it? It was ingrossed into the hands of a few, till it  became a Prey unto the Enemies of the Truth. If the Librarie-keeper had  been a man, that would have traded with it for the increas of true  Learning, it might have been preserved unto this daie in all the  rarities thereof, not so much by the shuttings up of the multitude of  Books, and the rareness thereof for antiquitie, as by the understandings  of men and their proficiencie to improv and dilate knowledg upon the  grounds which hee might have suggested unto others of parts, and so the  Librarie-rarities would not onely have been preserved in the spirits of  men, but have fructified abundantly therein unto this daie, whereas they  are now lost, becaus they were but a Talent digged in the ground; And  as they that had the keeping of that Librarie made it an Idol, to bee  respected and worshipped for a raritie by an implicite faith, without  anie benefit to those who did esteem of it a far off: so it was just  with God that it should fall into the hands of those that in all things  follow an Idolatrous waie, to blinde men with shewes without all  realitie of substantial virtue, which is onely eminent in this, that it  becometh profitable unto all, by dilating the light of knowledg, and the  love of grace and goodness in the hearts of all men, that are fit to  receiv the one and the other; And where this Aim is not in those that  are intrusted with publick places; there they in the end will bee found  unprofitable servants; for the trust which God hath put into their hands  to profit withal, they discharge not for the account which everie one is  to give unto him of his Stewardship, is not how careful hee hath kept  things of use unto himself, to pride himself in the possession of that  which others have not, (as the custom of men is, that know not what true  glorie is) but how faithfully and diligently hee hath distributed the  same to such as were worthie thereof for their good, that they might bee  stirred up both to glorifie God for his goodness; and to imitate him in  the Communication of all good things unto others for his sake freely.  This was Christ's Work on Earth to receiv us, unto the Glorie of God;  this was that which hee taught by this practice, that it is _more  blessed to give, then to receiv_. This is that which this envious World  cannot rellish, and what stop's the current of true love in the hearts  of men? Nothing so much as the self-seeking of men in the waies of  Learning, by which they covetously obstruct the fountains of life and  comfort, which might overflow and water abundantly the barren and  thirstie Souls of those that perish for want of address unto wisdom;  which in all the waies of humane and divine Learning might bee mainly  advanced, by the industrie of one man in such a place, whose Trade  should bee such as I formerly described, to deal with the spirits of all  men of parts, to set them a working one by and towards another, upon the  subjects which hee should bee intrusted withal to keep in the stock of  Learning. It is the Glorie and Riches of Nations and of great Cities, to  make themselvs the Center of Trade for all their Neighbors; and if they  can finde waies of politie, to oblige their Neighbors to receiv from  their Magazines the Commodities whereof they stand in need, it is  everie waie a great benefit unto the State, so it may bee in matters of  Learning, and by the Trade of Sciences this Church may oblige all the  Neighbor Churches, and that Universitie all Forreiners that Trade in  knowledg to receiv pretious Commodities, whereof they stand in need,  from our Magazines and Storehouses; if a painful Steward and dispenser  thereof, bee imploied and mainteined to use industrie for so blessed a  work, from whence much Glorie to God in the Gospel, and honor will  redound to the Nation. For although the waies of humane Learning are  almost infinite and wonderfully various, and have their peculiar uses in  the outward life of man, for which most men affect them, yet in one that  is to minde the universal good of all, the whole varietie and diversitie  of matters useful unto this present life, as they com within the sphere  of Learning must bee reduced, and may bee subordinate unto the  advancement of the Gospel of Christ, wherein the Glorie of the Nation,  at this and all times should bee thought to stand: And truly that is the  thing which take's most with mee, for which I would have that Librarie  thus improved by a faithful keeper, that when his Trade is set on foot,  with all those that are of eminent parts in their several faculties,  wee knowing who they are and wherein their eminencies do lie, may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#6)"],[1," for the measurements  of the terrestrial arc effected in Peru from 1735 to 1739 by Bouguer,  La Condamine, and Godin. At that time, according to the comparisons  made between this new _toise_ and the _Toise du Nord_, which had also  been used for the measurement of an arc of the meridian, an error of  the tenth part of a millimetre in measuring lengths of the order of a  metre was considered quite unimportant. At the end of the eighteenth  century, Delambre, in his work _Sur la Base du Systeme metrique  decimal_, clearly gives us to understand that magnitudes of the order  of the hundredth of a millimetre appear to him incapable of  observation, even in scientific researches of the highest precision.  At the present date the International Bureau of Weights and Measures  guarantees, in the determination of a standard of length compared with  the metre, an approximation of two or three ten-thousandths of a  millimetre, and even a little more under certain circumstances.    This very remarkable progress is due to the improvements in the method  of comparison on the one hand, and in the manufacture of the standard  on the other. M. Benoit rightly points out that a kind of competition  has been set up between the standard destined to represent the unit  with its subdivisions and multiples and the instrument charged with  observing it, comparable, up to a certain point, with that which in  another order of ideas goes on between the gun and the armour-plate.    The measuring instrument of to-day is an instrument of comparison  constructed with meticulous care, which enables us to do away with  causes of error formerly ignored, to eliminate the action of external  phenomena, and to withdraw the experiment from the influence of even  the personality of the observer. This standard is no longer, as  formerly, a flat rule, weak and fragile, but a rigid bar, incapable of  deformation, in which the material is utilised in the best conditions  of resistance. For a standard with ends has been substituted a  standard with marks, which permits much more precise definition and  can be employed in optical processes of observation alone; that is, in  processes which can produce in it no deformation and no alteration.  Moreover, the marks are traced on the plane of the neutral fibres[2]  exposed, and the invariability of their distance apart is thus  assured, even when a change is made in the way the rule is supported.    [Footnote 2: The author seems to refer to the fact that in the  standard metre, the measurement is taken from the central one of three  marks at each end of the bar. The transverse section of the bar is an  X, and the reading is made by a microscope.--ED.]    Thanks to studies thus systematically pursued, we have succeeded in  the course of a hundred years in increasing the precision of measures  in the proportion of a thousand to one, and we may ask ourselves  whether such an increase will continue in the future. No doubt  progress will not be stayed; but if we keep to the definition of  length by a material standard, it would seem that its precision cannot  be considerably increased. We have nearly reached the limit imposed by  the necessity of making strokes of such a thickness as to be  observable under the microscope.    It may happen, however, that we shall be brought one of these days to  a new conception of the measure of length, and that very different  processes of determination will be thought of. If we took as unit, for  instance, the distance covered by a given radiation during a  vibration, the optical processes would at once admit of much greater  precision.    Thus Fizeau, the first to have this idea, says: \"A ray of light, with  its series of undulations of extreme tenuity but perfect regularity,  may be considered as a micrometer of the greatest perfection, and  particularly suitable for determining length.\" But in the present  state of things, since the legal and customary definition of the unit  remains a material standard, it is not enough to measure length in  terms of wave-lengths, and we must also know the value of these  wave-lengths in terms of the standard prototype of the metre.    This was determined in 1894 by M. Michelson and M. Benoit in an  experiment which will remain classic. The two physicists measured a  standard length of about ten centimetres, first in terms of the  wave-lengths of the red, green, and blue radiations of cadmium, and  then in terms of the standard metre. The great difficulty of the  experiment proceeds from the vast difference which exists between the  lengths to be compared, the wave-lengths barely amounting to half a  micron;[3] the process employed consisted in noting, instead of this  length, a length easily made about a thousand times greater, namely,  the distance between the fringes of interference.    [Footnote 3: I.e. 1/2000 of a millimetre.--ED.]    In all measurement, that is to say in every determination of the  relation of a magnitude to the unit, there has to be determined on the  one hand the whole, and on the other the fractional part of this  ratio, and naturally the most delicate determination is generally that  of this fractional part. In optical processes the difficulty is  reversed. The fractional part is easily known, while it is the high  figure of the number representing the whole which becomes a very  serious obstacle. It is this obstacle which MM. Michelson and Benoit  overcame with admirable ingenuity. By making use of a somewhat similar  idea, M. Mace de Lepinay and MM. Perot and Fabry, have lately effected  by optical methods, measurements of the greatest precision, and no  doubt further progress may still be made. A day may perhaps come when  a material standard will be given up, and it may perhaps even be  recognised that such a standard in time changes its length by  molecular strain, and by wear and tear: and it will be further noted  that, in accordance with certain theories which will be noticed later  on, it is not invariable when its orientation is changed.    For the moment, however, the need of any change in the definition of  the unit is in no way felt; we must, on the contrary, hope that the  use of the unit adopted by the physicists of the whole world will  spread more and more. It is right to remark that a few errors still  occur with regard to this unit, and that these errors have been  facilitated by incoherent legislation. France herself, though she was  the admirable initiator of the metrical system, has for too long  allowed a very regrettable confusion to exist; and it cannot be noted  without a certain sadness that it was not until the _11th July 1903_  that a law was promulgated re-establishing the agreement between the  legal and the scientific definition of the metre.    Perhaps it may not be useless to briefly indicate here the reasons of  the disagreement which had taken place. Two definitions of the metre  can be, and in fact were given. One had for its basis the dimensions  of the earth, the other the length of the material standard. In the  minds of the founders of the metrical system, the first of these was  the true definition of the unit of length, the second merely a simple  representation. It was admitted, however, that this representation had  been constructed in a manner perfect enough for it to be nearly  impossible to perceive any difference between the unit and its  representation, and for the practical identity of the two definitions  to be thus assured. The creators of the metrical system were persuaded  that the measurements of the meridian effected in their day could  never be surpassed in precision; and on the other hand, by borrowing  from nature a definite basis, they thought to take from the definition  of the unit some of its arbitrary character, and to ensure the means  of again finding the same unit if by any accident the standard became  altered. Their confidence in the value of the processes they had seen  employed was exaggerated, and their mistrust of the future  unjustified. This example shows how imprudent it is to endeavour to  fix limits to progress. It is an error to think the march of science  can be stayed; and in reality it is now known that the ten-millionth  part of the quarter of the terrestrial meridian is longer than the  metre by 0.187 millimetres. But contemporary physicists do not fall  into the same error as their forerunners, and they regard the present  result as merely provisional. They guess, in fact, that new  improvements will be effected in the art of measurement; they know  that geodesical processes, though much improved in our days, have  still much to do to attain the precision displayed in the construction  and determination of standards of the first order; and consequently  they do not propose to keep the ancient definition, which would lead  to having for unit a magnitude possessing the grave defect from a  practical point of view of being constantly variable.    We may even consider that, looked at theoretically, its permanence  would not be assured. Nothing, in fact, proves that sensible  variations may not in time be produced in the value of an arc of the  meridian, and serious difficulties may arise regarding the probable  inequality of the various meridians.    For all these reasons, the idea of finding a natural unit has been  gradually abandoned, and we have become resigned to accepting as a  fundamental unit an arbitrary and conventional length having a  material representation recognised by universal consent; and it was  this unit which was consecrated by the following law of the 11th July  1903:--    \"The standard prototype of the metrical system is the international  metre, which has been sanctioned by the General Conference on Weights  and Measures.\"      Sec. 3. THE MEASURE OF MASS    On the subject of measures of mass, similar remarks to those on  measures of length might be made. The confusion here was perhaps still  greater,"]]]
