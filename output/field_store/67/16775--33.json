[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#3)"],[1,"meaning of folk-tales in general  is to decide which of them are really antique, and worthy, therefore,  of being submitted to critical analysis. Nor is it less difficult,  when dealing with the stories of any one country in particular, to  settle which may be looked upon as its own property, and which ought  to be considered as borrowed and adapted. Everyone knows that the  existence of the greater part of the stories current among the various  European peoples is accounted for on two different hypotheses--the one  supposing that most of them \"were common in germ at least to the Aryan  tribes before their migration,\" and that, therefore, \"these traditions  are as much a portion of the common inheritance of our ancestors as  their language unquestionably is:\"[11] the other regarding at least a  great part of them as foreign importations, Oriental fancies which  were originally introduced into Europe, through a series of  translations, by the pilgrims and merchants who were always linking  the East and the West together, or by the emissaries of some of the  heretical sects, or in the train of such warlike transferrers as the  Crusaders, or the Arabs who ruled in Spain, or the Tartars who so long  held the Russia of old times in their grasp. According to the former  supposition, \"these very stories, these _Maehrchen_, which nurses still  tell, with almost the same words, in the Thuringian forest and in the  Norwegian villages, and to which crowds of children listen under the  pippal trees of India,\"[12] belong \"to the common heirloom of the  Indo-European race;\" according to the latter, the majority of European  popular tales are merely naturalized aliens in Europe, being as little  the inheritance of its present inhabitants as were the stories and  fables which, by a circuitous route, were transmitted from India to  Boccaccio or La Fontaine.    On the questions to which these two conflicting hypotheses give rise  we will not now dwell. For the present, we will deal with the Russian  folk-tale as we find it, attempting to become acquainted with its  principal characteristics to see in what respects it chiefly differs  from the stories of the same class which are current among ourselves,  or in those foreign lands with which we are more familiar than we are  with Russia, rather than to explore its birthplace or to divine its  original meaning.    We often hear it said, that from the songs and stories of a country we  may learn much about the inner life of its people, inasmuch as popular  utterances of this kind always bear the stamp of the national  character, offer a reflex of the national mind. So far as folk-songs  are concerned, this statement appears to be well founded, but it can  be applied to the folk-tales of Europe only within very narrow limits.  Each country possesses certain stories which have special reference to  its own manners and customs, and by collecting such tales as these,  something approximating to a picture of its national life may be  laboriously pieced together. But the stories of this class are often  nothing more than comparatively modern adaptations of old and foreign  themes; nor are they sufficiently numerous, so far as we can judge  from existing collections, to render by any means complete the  national portrait for which they are expected to supply the materials.  In order to fill up the gaps they leave, it is necessary to bring  together a number of fragments taken from stories which evidently  refer to another clime--fragments which may be looked upon as  excrescences or developments due to the novel influences to which the  foreign slip, or seedling, or even full-grown plant, has been  subjected since its transportation.    The great bulk of the Russian folk-tales, and, indeed, of those of  all the Indo-European nations, is devoted to the adventures of such  fairy princes and princesses, such snakes and giants and demons, as  are quite out of keeping with ordinary men and women--at all events  with the inhabitants of modern Europe since the termination of those  internecine struggles between aboriginals and invaders, which some  commentators see typified in the combats between the heroes of our  popular tales and the whole race of giants, trolls, ogres, snakes,  dragons, and other monsters. The air we breathe in them is that of  Fairy-land; the conditions of existence, the relations between the  human race and the spiritual world on the one hand, the material world  on the other, are totally inconsistent with those to which we are now  restricted. There is boundless freedom of intercourse between mortals  and immortals, between mankind and the brute creation, and, although  there are certain conventional rules which must always be observed,  they are not those which are enforced by any people known to  anthropologists. The stories which are common to all Europe differ, no  doubt, in different countries, but their variations, so far as their  matter is concerned, seem to be due less to the moral character than  to the geographical distribution of their reciters. The manner in  which these tales are told, however, may often be taken as a test of  the intellectual capacity of their tellers. For in style the folk-tale  changes greatly as it travels. A story which we find narrated in one  country with terseness and precision may be rendered almost  unintelligible in another by vagueness or verbiage; by one race it may  be elevated into poetic life, by another it may be degraded into the  most prosaic dulness.    Now, so far as style is concerned, the Skazkas or Russian folk-tales,  may justly be said to be characteristic of the Russian people. There  are numerous points on which the \"lower classes\" of all the Aryan  peoples in Europe closely resemble each other, but the Russian peasant  has--in common with all his Slavonic brethren--a genuine talent for  narrative which distinguishes him from some of his more distant  cousins. And the stories which are current among the Russian peasantry  are for the most part exceedingly well narrated. Their language is  simple and pleasantly quaint, their humor is natural and unobtrusive,  and their descriptions, whether of persons or of events, are often  excellent.[13] A taste for acting is widely spread in Russia, and the  Russian folk-tales are full of dramatic positions which offer a wide  scope for a display of their reciter's mimetic talents. Every here and  there, indeed, a tag of genuine comedy has evidently been attached by  the story-teller to a narrative which in its original form was  probably devoid of the comic element.    And thus from the Russian tales may be derived some idea of the  mental characteristics of the Russian peasantry--one which is very  incomplete, but, within its narrow limits, sufficiently accurate. And  a similar statement may be made with respect to the pictures of  Russian peasant life contained in these tales. So far as they go they  are true to nature, and the notion which they convey to a stranger of  the manners and customs of Russian villagers is not likely to prove  erroneous, but they do not go very far. On some of the questions which  are likely to be of the greatest interest to a foreigner they never  touch. There is very little information to be gleaned from them, for  instance, with regard to the religious views of the people, none with  respect to the relations which, during the times of serfdom, existed  between the lord and the thrall. But from the casual references to  actual scenes and ordinary occupations which every here and there  occur in the descriptions of fairy-land and the narratives of heroic  adventure--from the realistic vignettes which are sometimes inserted  between the idealized portraits of invincible princes and irresistible  princesses--some idea may be obtained of the usual aspect of a Russian  village, and of the ordinary behavior of its inhabitants. Turning from  one to another of these accidental illustrations, we by degrees create  a mental picture which is not without its peculiar charm. We see the  wide sweep of the level corn-land, the gloom of the interminable  forest, the gleam of the slowly winding river. We pass along the  single street of the village, and glance at its wooden barn-like  huts,[14] so different from the ideal English cottage with its windows  set deep in ivy and its porch smiling with roses. We see the land  around a Slough of Despond in the spring, an unbroken sea of green in  the early summer, a blaze of gold at harvest-time, in the winter one  vast sheet of all but untrodden snow. On Sundays and holidays we  accompany the villagers to their white-walled, green-domed church, and  afterwards listen to the songs which the girls sing in the summer  choral dances, or take part in the merriment of the social gatherings,  which enliven the long nights of winter. Sometimes the quaint lyric  drama of a peasant wedding is performed before our eyes, sometimes we  follow a funeral party to one of those dismal and desolate nooks in  which the Russian villagers deposit their dead. On working days we see  the peasants driving afield in the early morn with their long lines of  carts, to till the soil, or ply the scythe or sickle or axe, till the  day is done and their rude carts come creaking back. We hear the songs  and laughter of the girls beside the stream or pool which ripples  pleasantly against its banks in the summer time, but in the winter  shows no sign of life, except at the spot, much frequented by the  wives and daughters of the village, where an \"ice-hole\" has been cut  in its massive pall. And at night we see the homely dwellings of the  villagers assume a picturesque aspect to which they are strangers by  the tell-tale light of day, their rough lines softened by the mellow  splendor of a summer moon, or their unshapely forms looming forth  mysteriously against the starlit snow of winter. Above all we become  familiar with those cottage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22379"],[0,"Masters of Water-Colour Painting (#3)"],[1,"Prout were subsequently elected  Associates, and afterwards became full members.    Amongst the founders the name of John Varley stands out beyond the  others. He was born at Hackney (see Plate XIV) in 1778. Receiving but  little instruction in art besides the assistance given to him by Dr.  Monro, he became a teacher of considerable reputation. Amongst his  pupils were many who afterwards became famous. To mention only a few,  there were William Mulready, who married his sister, Copley Fielding,  who espoused his wife's sister, W. Turner (of Oxford), David Cox,  William H. Hunt, Oliver Finch and John Linnell. Varley was a prolific  worker, and contributed more than seven hundred drawings to the \"Old\"  Society, averaging about forty works annually. His style was broad and  simple, with tints beautifully laid, without resort to stippling. He  wrote some works on drawing and perspective. He also was an enthusiast  in astrology, and compiled a \"Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy.\" John  Glover was a landscape painter and produced works, both in oil and in  water colours, into which he frequently introduced cattle. His father  having been a small farmer may account for this partiality for animals.  In water-colour painting he followed the methods of William Payne, the  inventor of a grey tint known as Payne's grey, in producing foliage by  splitting the hairs of his brush in order to give a feeling of  lightness, and he was partial to sunlight effects (see Plate XV). He was  President of the \"Old\" Society on two occasions, but he resigned his  membership, so as to become eligible for election to the Royal Academy.  He failed in his object and joined the Society of British Artists.  Glover suddenly left England in 1831, and went to the Swan River  Settlement in Australia. Afterwards he removed to Tasmania, where he  died.    Peter De Wint, a descendant of an old merchant family of Amsterdam, like  Glover, painted in oils and water colours, but his work was far  superior. He selected broad and open country for his scenes, which were  executed in a rich tone with a tendency to heavy uniform green. The  neighbourhood of Lincoln, where his wife, a sister of W. Hilton, R.A.,  was born, had special attractions to him. _St. Albans_ (Plate XVI) shows  the abbey in the ruinous state it had become from the time of the  Reformation. Its restoration was not commenced until 1856, under the  direction of Sir Gilbert Scott, and completed later by Lord Grimthorpe.  Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding belonged to an artistic family. His  father was a painter and three of his brothers all practised art with  success. He was one of the most fashionable drawing-masters of his day,  and a strong supporter of the \"Old\" Society. After being treasurer and  next secretary, he was appointed president in 1831, which post he  retained during his life. He was a most prolific worker and contributed  about seventeen hundred drawings to the Society's exhibitions, besides  showing at the Royal Academy and Royal Institution. At first his  favourite subjects were lake and mountain scenery (see Plate XVII).  After he took up his residence at Brighton he turned his attention to  marine painting and depicted many storms at sea. It has been  exaggeratedly said that Copley Fielding was \"perhaps the greatest artist  after Turner for representations of breadth and atmosphere.\" Ruskin also  praised his work. Owing, however, to his very rapid method of execution  there was a considerable sameness in his work.    The drawings by David Cox, although executed in an apparently careless  manner, give a greater rendering of atmospheric qualities and of  irradiation of light with a feeling of more movement than can be found  in the works of Fielding. Cox's early drawings were executed in a  somewhat stiff and restrained manner, with a delicate finish, but  afterwards his style became broad and he produced those breezy effects  which are almost unrivalled. _Boys Fishing_ (Plate XVIII) is an  excellent example of his later work. When Cox returned to his native  town, Birmingham, he devoted his attention to working in oils, and the  City Art Gallery possesses a superb collection of his paintings in this  medium. He was for the greater part of his life a teacher of drawing,  and he published a \"Treatise on Landscape Painting and Effect in Water  Colours,\" in which his views are clearly stated.*      [Footnote *: The \"Treatise\" has recently been republished as the    Special Autumn Number of _The Studio_.]    Samuel Prout, one of the numerous Devonshire painters, also derived a  great part of his income by giving instruction in drawing and painting.  Numerous drawing copies for students were produced by him by means of  soft-ground etching. He was at first employed by John Britton, the  author of \"The Beauties of England and Wales,\" in making topographical  drawings for this work. In 1819 he went to Normandy for the benefit of  his health. There he turned his attention to producing those paintings  of cathedrals and picturesque buildings for which he is noted. Later he  travelled through Germany and Switzerland to Italy, and visited Rome and  Venice (see Plate XIX). Afterwards he published facsimiles of many of  the drawings executed during these tours on the Continent. They were  produced in lithography by himself on the stone, an art in which he  greatly excelled. The architectural drawings by Prout are remarkable for  their picturesque treatment, rather than for correctness of  construction. Details are sparsely indicated by the use of a reed pen.  Bright effects of light and shade are, however, given, and the  introduction of groups of figures add brilliancy to these paintings.    James Duffield Harding, like Prout, from whom he received some lessons,  also excelled in lithography. Many of his paintings were reproduced by  him in a publication entitled \"Sketches at Home and Abroad.\" He visited  Italy on two occasions. _Vico, in the Bay of Naples_, between  Castellamare and Sorrento (Plate XX), is an example of his free manner  of painting. An engraving of it appeared in the \"Landscape Annual\" in  1832. He was a member of the \"Old\" Society, and also painted in oils.  William Henry Hunt, familiarly called \"Old\" or \"Billy\" Hunt in his  latter years by his fellow artists, to distinguish him from William  Holman Hunt, was an artist with a style peculiar to himself. He painted  figures, especially young rustics, with a sense of humour, but he is  chiefly noted for his exquisite fruit and flower pieces, which were  executed with great delicacy and with a remarkable power of rendering  the effects of light and shade on the surface of the objects. To obtain  these he would roughly pencil out, say, a group of plums, and thickly  coat each one with Chinese white, which would be left to harden. On this  ground he afterwards painted his colours with a sure hand. By this means  he would obtain a brilliant effect. Further, to enhance it, he would  make free use of the knife on the various surroundings to give a  contrast, and at the same time to produce a feeling of texture on the  various surfaces, so as not to have a monotonous and flat appearance.  This method of scraping up portions of the surface of the paper is  clearly shown in _Plucking the Fowl_ (Plate XXI).    James Holland commenced his artistic career by painting flowers on  pottery at the factory of James Davenport at Burslem. He came to London  and continued to paint flowers. After a visit to Paris he devoted  himself to landscapes. Subsequently he visited Venice, and produced, in  both oils and water colours, some excellent paintings remarkable for  their brilliant colouring (see Plate XXII).    James Baker Pyne, born at Bristol, was a self-taught artist. He also is  noted for his brilliant colouring, but there is a want of solidity in  his painting. He visited the Continent and travelled as far as Italy  (see Plate XXIII). His landscapes were chiefly river and lake subjects.  He published \"The English Lake District\" and \"The Lake Scenery of  England,\" illustrated with lithographs of his works. He was a member of  the Society of British Artists, and became a vice-president. Like  Girtin, the illustrious young painter Richard Parkes Bonington was cut  off in life at the early age of twenty-seven. He was born at Arnold,  near Nottingham. Whilst still a boy he was taken by his parents to  Calais, where he received some instruction in water colours from  Francia. Later the family settled in Paris. Here Bonington resided the  greater part of his life. He made a few visits to England, and on the  last occasion he was taken ill and died of consumption. He practised at  the Louvre and the _Institut_, and also received instruction from Baron  Gros. His paintings, in oil and water colours, were almost entirely  executed in France; he, however, made one visit to Italy. In Paris his  works were chiefly architectural with street scenes, admirably executed,  whilst his landscapes with fine atmospheric effects (see Plate XXIV)  display great freedom in execution. It is somewhat remarkable that after  Cotman and Bonington had, in the first part of the nineteenth century,  developed a style so greatly appreciated at the present time, so many of  the landscape painters in water colours in the early Victorian era  should still have adhered to the old restricted methods. Constable  exercised considerable influence on the French landscape painting in  oil, whilst Bonington showed the French artists the capabilities of  water colours, which they did not fail to appreciate.
