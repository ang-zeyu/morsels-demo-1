As this innovating creature  sought for agents of power in the wilderness about him, he blindly laid  hands upon such of the fellow tenants of the wilds as might serve his  immediate needs. This species, both animals and plants, endowed with the  capacity for variation, the plasticity which is in general a  characteristic of all organic forms, were early led by their new master,  as of old they had been guided by the old organic laws. They changed  according to his choice, abandoning their ancient ways for the novel  paths of civilization. With this association of the higher forms of the  earth under the leadership of man, there began an entirely new and  unprecedented condition of the world's affairs. In place of the ancient  law of nature there came the control of our species which had been, in a  way, chosen to be the overlord of life.    At first, the number of species of animals and plants which man brought  under his control was very limited; it was indeed confined to those  which might readily be subjugated to meet immediate needs. Gradually,  however, the list has been extended until it included thousands of  forms, which, while they meet no need such as the savage recognizes, are  gratifying to the taste or the ambitions of civilized peoples. These  aesthetic devices, or those of necessity, are advancing so rapidly that  each generation sees hundreds of new animal and plant species added to  our living collections, so that our plant and animal gardens now contain  a large share of the more attractive forms which are to be found in the  various geographical realms. Our tilled fields yield perhaps a hundred  times as many varieties of plants as they did in the earliest historic  agriculture. The advance in the process of domestication is not so rapid  as regards the animal kingdom as it is with the realm of plants, and  this mainly for the reason that animals have a will of their own which  has to be bent or broken to that of man. Still it goes on apace. We of  to-day have at our command many times the number of sentient species  contributive to our pleasure or profit that had been made captive at the  beginning of our era. Naturally, in the early days of domestication, men  brought under their control the greater number of the animals which gave  promise of utility. As no new species of any economic importance have  been created within the last geologic period, the field for the  extension of economic domestication has of late been very limited. But  the realm of sympathetic appreciation, unlike the economic, knows no  definite bounds, and promises in time to bring all the more important  organic forms under the care of the sympathetic and masterful being who  has been chosen as the ruler of terrestrial life.    We thus see that the matter of domesticated animals is but a part of the  larger problem which includes all that relates to man's destined mastery  of the earth--a mastery which he is rapidly winning. It means that, in  time, a large part of the life of this sphere is to be committed to his  care, to survive or perish as he wills, to change at his bidding, to  give, as other subjugated kinds have done, whatever of profit or  pleasure they may contribute to his endless advancement. From this point  of view our domesticated creatures should be presented to our people,  with the purpose in mind of bringing them to see that the process of  domestication has a far-reaching aspect, a dignity, we may fairly say a  grandeur, that few human actions possess. If we can impress this view,  it will be certain to awaken men to a larger sense of their  responsibility for, and their duty by, the creatures which we have taken  from their olden natural state into the social order. It will, at the  same time, enlarge our conceptions of our own place in the order of this  world.    In the following pages little effort has been made to present those  facts concerning domesticated animals which would commonly be reckoned  as scientific. The several essays which, in larger part, were separately  printed in Scribner's Magazine, are intended for those persons who,  while they may not care to approach the matter in the manner of the  professional inquirer, are glad to have the results which naturalists  have attained, so far as they may serve to extend knowledge of things  which lie in the field of familiar experiences. To the text as it at  first appeared, numerous additions have been made, and the concluding  chapters, on the Rights of Animals, and on the Problem of Domestication,  are new. In them an effort is made to direct attention to the importance  of the problem of man's relation to the lower life which is about him,  and which in the future far more than in the past is to be helped or  hindered by his rule. Our life is made up of large problems; but there  seem few that are greater than this, which concerns our duty by the  creatures that share with us the blessings of existence, and over which  we have come to rule.

It is an interesting fact that the first creature which man won to  domesticity was made captive and friend for the sake of companionship  rather than for any grosser profit. The dog was, the world over, the  first living possession of man beyond the limits of his own kindred. He  has been so long separated from the primitive species whence he sprang  that we cannot trace with any certainty his kinship with the creatures  of the wilderness. Like his master he has become so artificialized that  it is hard to conjecture what his original state may have been.    Naturalists are much divided in opinion in all that relates to the  origin of our ancient and common domesticated animals; and this for the  reason that the longer a creature has been subjected to the  change-bringing conditions of our fields and households, the further it  has departed from the parent stock. This difficulty is naturally the  greatest in the case of the dogs, for the reason that they have been  longer and more completely under the control of man than any other of  the lower animals. Some students of the problem have inclined to the  opinion that the dog is a descendant of the wolf; the whelps of this  species, it is supposed, were captured by primitive men and brought  under domestication. Savages, like children, are much given to bringing  the young of wild animals to their homes; if the conditions are  favorable they will care for these captives, even if the charge upon  their resources is tolerably heavy. With most primitive people, however,  life is so vagarious and starvation so recurrent that they are not apt  to retain their pets long enough to establish domesticated forms. Thus,  among our American Indians, though they show fondness for wild creatures  as much as any other people, no species save the dog ever became  permanently associated with their tribe. It is, however, possible, that  in some sedentary group of savages the work of domesticating the  ancestors of the dog, even if they were wolf-like, was accomplished.    The difficulty of this view is that even with the high measure of care  which the conditions of civilization permit us to devote to the  effort, it has been found impossible to educate captive wolves to the  point where they show any affection for their masters, or are in the  least degree useful in the arts of the household or the occupations of  the chase. They are, in fact, indomitably fierce and utterly  self-regarding. It seems unreasonable to believe that any savage would  have found either pleasure or profit from an effort to tame any of the  known species of wolves. Moreover, the fact that dogs show little or  no tendency to revert to the form and habits of their brutal kindred,  or to interbreed with them, is clearly against the supposition that  there is any close relation between the creatures.    [Illustration: Greyhound after \"the Kill\"]    Yet other speculative inquirers have sought the origin of the dog  through the admixture of the blood of several different species, the  wolf and the jackal being, perhaps, the principal or the only components  of the hybrid stock. Here, too, the evidence of nature is against the  supposition. No one has ever succeeded in hybridizing the wolf and the  jackal, nor do our dogs show any more tendency to revert to the jackal  than to the wolf. They meet their tropical relative with as much  animosity as is proper, or at least customary, in the intercourse of  allied yet distinct species. In fact, all the indices by which we are  able to carry back the history of other domesticated animals to their  primitive or even extinct ancestry, fail in the case of the dog. When  the stock is allowed to go as nearly wild as they can be induced to  become, we do not find that they thereby approach to any known wild  form. It therefore seems reasonable to betake ourselves to another  basis for the natural history of the dog, which has not yet been made a  matter of much inquiry, but which promises to afford us more substantial  truth than the conjectures which we have just considered.    We should, in the first place, note the fact that the ancestors of our  more important domesticated animals, those which have been longest in  subjugation, have commonly disappeared from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2557"],[0,"Old Mother West Wind (#3)"],[1,"the broken shells about her.    Reddy Fox, Peter Rabbit, Johnny Chuck, Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter,  Jerry Muskrat, Hooty the Owl, Bobby Coon, Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow,  Grandfather Frog, Mr. Toad, Spotty the Turtle, the Merry Little Breezes,  all were there. Last of all came Jimmy Skunk. Very handsome he looked in  his shining black coat and very sorry he appeared that such a dreadful  thing should have happened. He told Mrs. Grouse how badly he felt, and  he loudly demanded that the culprit should be found out and severely  punished.    Old Dame Nature has the most smiling face in the world, but this time it  was very, very grave indeed. First she asked little Mrs. Grouse to tell  her story all over again that all might hear. Then each in turn was  asked to tell where he had been the night before. Johnny Chuck, Happy  Jack Squirrel, Striped Chipmunk, Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow had gone  to bed when Mr. Sun went down behind the Purple Hills. Jerry Muskrat,  Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle had  not left the Smiling Pool. Bobby Coon had been down in Farmer Brown's  cornfield. Hooty the Owl had been hunting in the lower end of the Green  Meadows. Peter Rabbit had been down in the berry patch. Mr. Toad had  been under the piece of bark which he called a house. Old Dame Nature  called on Jimmy Skunk last of all. Jimmy protested that he had been  very, very tired and had gone to bed very early indeed and had slept the  whole night through.    Then Old Dame Nature asked Peter Rabbit what he had found among the egg  shells that morning.    Peter Rabbit hopped out and laid three long black hairs before Old  Dame Nature. \"These,\" said Peter Rabbit \"are what I found among the egg  shells.\"    Then Old Dame Nature called Johnny Chuck. \"Tell us, Johnny Chuck,\" said  she, \"what you saw when you called at Jimmy Skunk's house this morning.\"    \"I saw Jimmy Skunk,\" said Johnny Chuck, \"and Jimmy seemed very, very  sleepy. It seemed to me that his whiskers were yellow.\"    \"That will do,\" said Old Dame Nature, and then she called Old Mother  West Wind.    \"What time did you come down on the Green Meadows this morning?\"    \"Just at the break of day,\" said Old Mother West Wind, \"as Mr. Sun was  coming up from behind the Purple Hills.\"    \"And whom did you see so early in the morning?\" asked Old Dame Nature.    \"I saw Bobby Coon going home from old Farmer Brown's cornfield,\" said  Old Mother West Wind. \"I saw Hooty the Owl coming back from the lower  end of the Green Meadows. I saw Peter Rabbit down in the berry patch.  Last of all I saw something like a black shadow coming down the Lone  Little Path toward the house of Jimmy Skunk.\"    Every one was looking very hard at Jimmy Skunk. Jimmy began to look very  unhappy and very uneasy.    \"Who wears a black coat?\" asked Dame Nature.    \"Jimmy Skunk!\" shouted all the little meadow folks.    \"What MIGHT make whiskers yellow?\" asked Old Dame Nature.    No one seemed to know at first. Then Peter Rabbit spoke up. \"It MIGHT be  the yolk of an egg,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Who are likely to be sleepy on a bright sunny morning?\" asked Old Dame  Nature.    \"People who have been out all night,\" said Johnny Chuck, who himself  always goes to bed with the sun.    \"Jimmy Skunk,\" said Old Dame Nature, and her voice was very stern, very  stern indeed, and her face was very grave. \"Jimmy Skunk, I accuse you  of having broken and eaten the eggs of Mrs. Grouse. What have you to say  for yourself?\"    Jimmy Skunk hung his head. He hadn't a word to say. He just wanted to  sneak away by himself.    \"Jimmy Skunk,\" said Old Dame Nature, \"because your handsome black coat  of which you are so proud has made it possible for you to move about  in the night without being seen, and because we can no longer trust  you upon your honor, henceforth you and your descendants shall wear a  striped coat, which is the sign that you cannot be trusted. Your coat  hereafter shall be black and white, that when you move about in the  night you will always be visible.\"    And this is why that to this day Jimmy Skunk wears a striped suit of  black and white.        CHAPTER V THE WILFUL LITTLE BREEZE    Old Mother West Wind was tired--tired and just a wee bit cross--cross  because she was tired. She had had a very busy day. Ever since early  morning she had been puffing out the white sales of the ships on the big  ocean so that they could go faster; she had kept all the big and little  wind mills whirling and whirling to pump water for thirsty folks and  grind corn for hungry folks; she had blown away all the smoke from tall  chimneys and engines and steamboats. Yes, indeed, Old Mother West Wind  had been very, very busy.    Now she was coming across the Green Meadows on her way to her home  behind the Purple Hills, and as she came she opened the big bag she  carried and called to her children, the Merry Little Breezes, who had  been playing hard on the Green Meadows all the long day. One by one they  crept into the big bag, for they were tired, too, and ready to go to  their home behind the Purple Hills.    Pretty soon all were in the bag but one, a willful little Breeze, who  was not quite ready to go home; he wanted to play just a little longer.  He danced ahead of Old Mother West Wind. He kissed the sleepy daisies.  He shook the nodding buttercups. He set all the little poplar leaves a  dancing, too, and he wouldn't come into the big bag. So Old Mother West  Wind closed the big bag and slung it over her shoulder. Then she started  on towards her home behind the Purple Hills.    When she had gone, the willful little Breeze left behind suddenly felt  very lonely--very lonely indeed! The sleepy daisies didn't want to play.  The nodding buttercups were cross. Great round bright Mr. Sun, who had  been shining and shining all day long, went to bed and put on his night  cap of golden clouds. Black shadows came creeping, creeping out into the  Green Meadows.    The willful little Breeze began to wish that he was safe in Old Mother  West Wind's big bag with all the other Merry Little Breezes.    So he started across the Green Meadows to find the Purple Hills. But  all the hills were black now and he could not tell which he should look  behind to find his home with Old Mother West Wind and the Merry Little  Breezes. How he did wish that he had minded Old Mother West Wind.    By and by he curled up under a bayberry bush and tried to go to sleep,  but he was lonely, oh, so lonely! And he couldn't go to sleep. Old  Mother Moon came up and flooded all the Green Meadows with light, but it  wasn't like the bright light of jolly round Mr. Sun, for it was cold and  white and it made many black shadows.    Pretty soon the willful little Breeze heard Hooty the Owl out hunting  for a meadow mouse for his dinner. Then down the Lone Little Path which  ran close to the bayberry bush trotted Reddy Fox. He was trotting very  softly and every minute or so he turned his head and looked behind him  to see if he was followed. It was plain to see that Reddy Fox was bent  on mischief.    When he reached the bayberry bush Reddy Fox sat down and barked twice.  Hooty the Owl answered him at once and flew over to join him. They  didn't see the willful little Breeze curled up under the bayberry bush,  so intent were these two rogues in plotting mischief. They were planning  to steal down across the Green Meadows to the edge of the Brown Pasture  where Mr. Bob White and pretty Mrs. Bob White and a dozen little Bob  Whites had their home.    \"When they run along the ground I'll catch 'em, and when they fly up in  the air you'll catch 'em, and we'll gobble 'em all up,\" said Reddy Fox  to Hooty the Owl. Then he licked his chops and Hooty the Owl snapped his  bill, just as if they were tasting tender little Bob Whites that very  minute. It made the willful little Breeze shiver to see them. Pretty  soon they started on towards the Brown Pasture.    When they were out of sight the willful little Breeze jumped up and  shook himself. Then away he sped across the Green Meadows to the Brown  Pasture. And because he could go faster and because he went a shorter  way he got there first. He had to hunt and hunt to find Mrs. and Mr. Bob  White and all the little Bob Whites, but finally he did find them, all  with their heads tucked under their wings fast asleep.    The willful little Breeze shook Mr. Bob White very gently. In an instant  he was wide awake.    \"Sh-h-h,\" said the willful little Breeze. \"Reddy Fox and Hooty the Owl  are coming to the Brown Pasture to gobble up you and Mrs. Bob White and  all the little Bob Whites.\"    \"Thank you, little Breeze,\" said Mr. Bob White, \"I think I'll move my  family.\"    Then he woke Mrs. Bob White and all the little Bob Whites. With Mr.  Bob White in the lead away they all flew to the far side of the Brown  Pasture where they were soon safely hidden under a juniper tree.    The willful little Breeze saw them safely there, and when they were  nicely hidden hurried back to the place where the Bob Whites had been  sleeping. Reddy Fox was stealing up through the grass very, very softly.  Hooty the Owl was flying as silently as a shadow. When Reddy Fox thought  he was near enough he drew himself together, made a quick spring and  landed right in Mr. Bob White's empty bed. Reddy Fox and Hooty the Owl  looked so surprised and foolish when they found the Bob Whites were not  there that the willful little Breeze nearly laughed out loud.    Then Reddy Fox and Hooty the Owl hunted here and hunted there, all over  the Brown Pasture, but they couldn't find the Bob Whites.    And the willful little Breeze went back to the juniper tree and curled  himself beside Mr. Bob White to sleep, for he was lonely no longer.
