This gigantic system, which oppressed all                     Europe, could not fail to raise the entire                     continent against Napoleon and France, and thus to                     bring on the ruin of both. \"Rome,\" as it is said by                     Montesquieu, \"extended her empire because her wars                     only followed in succession. Each nation, such was                     her inconceivable good fortune, waited till another                     had been conquered, before beginning the attack.\"                     Rome fell as soon as all the nations assailed and                     penetrated on every side.]    Hostilities ended with the abdication of Napoleon. The people of  Paris, who had scarcely recovered from the panic with which they were  struck by the marauding hordes of Russia, displayed the most  extravagant gladness when they thought that they were delivered from  the visitation, which again threatened them in the presence of the  allies and the imperial army.    The neighbouring departments, which the enemy prepared to invade,  rejoiced on being relieved from impending pillage and devastation.    The departments which had been occupied by the enemy were intoxicated  with joy, when they anticipated the termination of their sufferings.    Thus almost all the people of France turned away from their discarded  sovereign. And they abandoned themselves to joy when they thought that  they were delivered from the scourge of war, and that they could hope  to enjoy the blessings of peace.    It was in the midst of this pouring out of the spirit of selfishness,  that the senate raised the brother of Louis XVI. to the throne. His  election was not in conformity to the expectations of the people, and  it disappointed the wishes which had been uttered in favour of the  Empress and her son; yet the choice of the senate was but slightly  opposed, because the recall of Louis seemed to be necessarily the  pledge of peace. And peace was more the object of the public wish than  any other thing. Besides which, the Bourbons followed the wise  counsels which had been given to them. They lost no time in issuing  their proclamations, couched in fair language, in order to calm the  fears and diminish the antipathies excited by their recall.    \"We will guarantee,\" said they, \"the rank, the honours, and the  rewards of the military.    \"The magistracy and all public functionaries shall retain their  offices and their pre-eminence.    \"To the people we promise a total oblivion of their political conduct;  and we will maintain them in the full enjoyment of their civil rights,  their property, and their social institutions.\"    The French nation, whose confidence is so easily abused, considered  these promises as sacred and inviolable, and they delighted in  repeating the happy reply of the Count of Artois[3], \"Il n'y aura rien  de change en France, il n'y aura que quelques Francais de plus.\"  They, the men, who had banished the imperial dynasty, laboured to  foster the growing confidence of the nation. The press was brought  into full play, and the country teemed with publications in which they  represented the sovereign whom they had brought in, as invested with  those attributes which were calculated to conciliate the nation. The  public were carefully informed, that the king \"opened and read all the  dispatches himself. It is he who dictates every answer. Where it  becomes necessary to meet the ministers of foreign powers, he  transacts business with them; he receives the reports of their  missions, which he answers either by word of mouth, or in writing. In  short, he alone directs all the concerns of the government, both at  home and abroad. If his virtues and goodness are such as to cause the  French to know that they will now find a kind and affectionate father  in their King, they may also look with confidence to the future fate  of the nation, relying on his brilliant information, his strength of  character, and his aptitude for business[4].\"                       [Footnote 3: He arrived at Paris before his august                     brother, and by these pleasing expressions he                     replied to the addresses of congratulation                     presented to him by the municipality of Paris.]                       [Footnote 4: Extracted from the Journal des Debats.                     The principal proprietor and editor of this paper                     was Monsieur Laborie, one of Talleyrand's                     creatures, and private secretary to the provisional                     government.]    Thus the people congratulated themselves, when they were assured that  their Chief Magistrate was an enlightened sovereign, a kind sovereign,  an equitable sovereign, and one who was determined not to allow the  guiding reins of the state to slip from his paternal hands into those  of his ministers. Our lively imagination gave us a present enjoyment  of the blessings, which, as we anticipated, would hereafter be  diffused over the kingdom by his goodness, his prudence, and his  acquirements. If this glowing vision of hope and loyalty was slightly  dimmed by a few secret doubts, such misgivings were checked and  repelled by the name of our native country; nay, by the name of the  Emperor himself. For when Napoleon bade farewell to his trusty  soldiers, it was in these words: \"Be faithful to the new sovereign of  France; do not rend asunder our beloved and long-suffering land.\"    These circumstances (nor must the charm of novelty be excluded) united  in favour of the king, and won every head and every heart. He  appeared--he was received with acclamations of love and gladness,  which resounded until he entered the palace of his forefathers.    No counter revolution ever effected the change of a royal dynasty,  under such favourable auspices.    The French nation felt jaded by civil dissensions, by misfortune--even  their victories had weaned them. They longed for the happiness of  repose. Memorable were the words of the king's brother; \"let us forget  the past, let us look only towards the future, let us all unite in the  good work of labouring to heal the wounds of our common country;\" and  these honoured precepts had become implanted in every mind. They  formed the canon of all our feelings and all our duties.    As long as the machinery of the new government did not begin to work,  this loyal harmony subsisted, and no longer. For when it became  necessary to settle the organization of the army, the ministry, and  the magistracy, then self-love gained an easy victory over patriotism,  and the bad passions, pride, ambition, and party-hatred, roused  themselves from their slumber.    During a quarter of a century, our emigrants had sojourned in a  strange country. Useless and troublesome guests to the strangers by  whom they were fed, their lives had been droned away in shameless and  cowardly idleness. They could not cheat themselves into a belief that  they possessed the talents and experience of the sons of the  revolution. But they imagined that nobility, as in the old time, might  pass for worth; and that their patents and pedigrees still gave them  a right to monopolize all power and all honour.    The citizens, the soldiers, the nation, relied on the lawfulness of  their rights no less than on the promises of the king. The members of  the old privileged caste, instead of exciting suspicion, were only the  objects of harmless mirth. The people laughed at the grotesque  appearance of some, and at the decrepit sottishness of others. They  never dreamed that these pretended warriors, whose bloodless swords  had rusted in their scabbards, would attempt to snatch the staff of  command from the veteran generals of France; and that nobles who had  grown old in sloth and ignorance would aspire to the direction of  public affairs.    But though merit and valour were denied to them, they stood upon a  vantage ground, which gave them a direful and incalculable  preponderance in the state. They surrounded the throne. Soon did their  insolence announce that they had craftily availed themselves of the  advantages which they possessed; and we foresaw with affliction that  inveterate prejudice, malignant prepossessions, and old habits of  familiarity, would, sooner or later, crush the principles of justice  and equity, however solemnly proclaimed.    The emigrants, rendered arrogant by the prospects which opened upon  them, now treated their rivals with contemptuous disdain. They dared  not insult the defenders of our country face to face, because the  scars of the warriors scared them. But they were spitefully active in  disparaging their birth, their services, and their glory, and these  noble retainers of royalty took care to impress the soldiers of  Napoleon with a due sense of the width of the gulf which was  henceforth to separate a gentleman of good family, from an upstart  soldier of the revolution.    The women of the _ancien regime_ did not share in the timidity which,  to a certain degree, still restrained their husbands. They threw off  all decency and all reserve, and indulged in all the fury of their  spite and pride. Without attempting to disguise their sentiments, they  openly insulted the titled dames belonging to the new nobility, and  such of the latter as were compelled to go to court on account of the  situations held by their husbands, never entered the saloon without  dread, and never quitted it without being bathed in tears.    Uneasy, harassed, and discontented, the people implored the fulfilment  of the king's promises: they prayed with confidence; but the  government heard them not, and repulsed them harshly. The Doge of  Genoa, speaking of Louis XIV, said, \"his majesty steals our hearts by  his amiability, but his ministers give them back again to us.\" The  apophthegm of the Doge might have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#3)"],[1,"a basement high, the upper floor being an attic.  A heavy railing runs from in front of the basement up the broad front  steps to the doorway. Inside, the rooms are large and comfortably  arranged, and there was, in those days, quite a nice garden in the rear.    [Illustration: THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S BIRTHPLACE. 28 E. 20TH STREET, NEW  YORK CITY.]    It can truthfully be said that Theodore Roosevelt comes from a race of  soldiers and statesmen, and that Dutch, Scotch, French, and Irish blood  flows in his veins. This being so, it is no wonder that, when the  Spanish-American War broke out, he closed his desk as Assistant  Secretary of the Navy, saying, \"My duty here is done; my place is in the  field,\" and went forth to win glory on the battle-field of San Juan  Hill.    Five generations of Roosevelts lived in or near New York previous to the  birth of Theodore Roosevelt, the father of the President, in 1831.  Nearly all were well-to-do, and many served the city and the state as  aldermen and members of the legislature. During the Revolution they  followed under Washington's banner, and their purses were wide open to  further the cause of independence.    Theodore Roosevelt the elder was a merchant and banker; a man broad in  his views and filled with the spirit of genuine philanthropy. He founded  one of the hospitals of the city and was at one time chairman of the  State Board of Charities. A story is told of him which is probably true.  One day Charles Loring Brace came to him for financial assistance in  establishing homes for the little waifs of the city.    \"I will see what I can do,\" said Mr. Roosevelt. \"But you know that just  at present I am busy with other charitable works.\"    \"I know that,\" said Mr. Brace. \"But what I ask for is very much needed.  The waifs and poor, homeless newsboys have no shelter.\"    The next day, when returning from the establishment in which he was a  partner, Mr. Roosevelt came upon a newsboy sitting on a doorstep, crying  bitterly.    \"What is the matter, my little man?\" he asked.    \"I lost me money; it dropped down into de sewer hole!\" sobbed the ragged  urchin. \"Every cent of it is gone.\"    Mr. Roosevelt questioned the lad and found out that the boy had no home  and that his only relative was a longshoreman who was hardly ever sober.  He gave the lad some money to replace the amount lost, and the next day  sent word to Mr. Brace that he would do all he possibly could toward  establishing the waifs' shelters that were so much needed. The Newsboys'  Lodging House of New York City is one of the results of Mr. Roosevelt's  practical charities. He also did much to give criminals a helping hand  when they came from prison, stating that that was the one time in their  lives when they most needed help, for fear they might slip back into  their previous bad habits.    In 1853 Theodore Roosevelt the elder married Miss Martha Bullock, of  Roswell, Cobb County, Georgia. Miss Bullock was the daughter of Major  James S. Bullock and a direct descendant of Archibald Bullock, the first  governor of Georgia. It will thus be seen that the future President had  both Northern and Southern blood in his make-up, and it may be added  here that during the terrible Civil War his relatives were to be found  both in the Union and the Confederate ranks. Mrs. Roosevelt was a strong  Southern sympathizer, and when a certain gathering, during the Civil  War, was in progress at the Roosevelt city home, she insisted upon  displaying a Confederate flag at one of the windows.    \"I am afraid it will make trouble,\" said Mr. Roosevelt; and he was  right. Soon a mob began to gather in the street, clamoring that the flag  be taken down.    \"I shall not take it down,\" said Mrs. Roosevelt, bravely. \"The room is  mine, and the flag is mine. I love it, and nobody shall touch it.  Explain to the crowd that I am a Southern woman and that I love my  country.\"    There being no help for it, Mr. Roosevelt went to the front door and  explained matters as best he could. A few in the crowd grumbled, but  when Mrs. Roosevelt came to the window and looked down on the gathering,  one after another the men went away, and she and her flag remained  unmolested.    Theodore Roosevelt, the future President, was one of a family of four.  He had a brother Elliott and two sisters. His brother was several years  younger than himself, but much more robust, and would probably have  lived many years and have distinguished himself, had he not met death in  a railroad accident while still a young man.    In the years when Theodore Roosevelt was a boy, New York City was not  what it is to-day. The neighborhood in which he lived was, as I have  already mentioned, a fashionable one, and the same may be said of many  other spots near to Union Square, where tall business blocks were yet  unknown. The boys and girls loved to play in the little park and on the  avenue, and here it was that the rather delicate schoolboy grew to know  Edith Carew, who lived in Fourteenth Street and who was his school  companion. Little did they dream in those days, as they played together,  that one day he would be President and she his loving wife, the mistress  of the White House.    Mr. Roosevelt was a firm believer in public institutions, and he did not  hesitate to send his children to the public schools, especially his  boys, that they might come in direct personal contact with the great  outside world. So to a near-by institution of learning Theodore and  Elliott trudged day after day, with their school-books under their arms,  just as thousands of other schoolboys are doing to-day. But in those  days there were few experiments being tried in the schools, and manual  training and the like were unknown. The boys were well grounded in  reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as spelling, history, and  geography, and there was great excitement when a \"spelling-bee\" was in  progress, to see who could spell the rest of the class or the gathering  down.    It is said upon good authority that Theodore Roosevelt was a model  scholar from the start. He loved to read Cooper's \"Leatherstocking  Tales,\" and works of travel, and preferred books above anything else.  But when he found that constant studying was ruining his constitution,  he determined to build himself up physically as well as mentally.    In the summer time the family often went to the old Roosevelt \"out of  town\" mansion on Long Island. This was called \"Tranquillity,\" a fine  large place near Oyster Bay, set in a grove of beautiful trees. The  journey to \"Tranquillity\" was in those days a tedious one, but the  Roosevelt children did not mind it, and once at the old place they were  certain of a good time so long as their vacation lasted. Here it was  that Theodore Roosevelt learned to ride on horseback and how to handle a  gun. And here, too, the boys would go boating, fishing, and bathing, to  their hearts' content.    Mr. Theodore Roosevelt the elder was a member of the Dutch Reformed  Church, and the religious teaching of his children was not neglected. At  an early age the future President became a member of that denomination  and has remained a member ever since. The church was on the East Side,  and had high-backed pews, and here were delivered sermons that were as  long as they were full of strength and wisdom. That these sermons had  their full effect upon the future President is shown by his addresses  delivered before the Young Men's Christian Association of New York City  and a church community of the West, years later. In addressing the  Young Men's Christian Association Mr. Roosevelt, who was then governor  of the State, said:--    \"The vice of envy is not only dangerous, but also a mean vice, for it is  always a confession of inferiority. It may provoke conduct which will be  fruitful of wrong to others; and it must cause misery to the man who  feels it. It will not be any the less fruitful of wrong and misery if,  as is often the case with evil motives, it adopts some high-sounding  alias. The truth is, gentlemen, that each one of us has in him certain  passions and instincts which, if they gain the upper hand in his soul,  would mean that the wild beast had come uppermost in him. Envy, malice,  and hatred are such passions, and they are just as bad if directed  against a class or group of men as if directed against an individual.\"    Golden words, well worth remembering. A person who believes in them with  all his heart cannot go far wrong in his actions, no matter what his  station in life.          CHAPTER II    NICKNAMED TEDDY--GOES TO HARVARD COLLEGE--MEMBER OF MANY CLUBS--DEATH OF  MR. ROOSEVELT--ANECDOTES OF COLLEGE LIFE      The instincts of the hunter must have been born in Theodore Roosevelt.  His first gun was given to him when he was ten years of age, and for the  time being his books and his studies were forgotten, and he devoted his  whole time and attention to shooting at a target set up in the garden of  the country home and in going out with the older folks after such small  game as were to be found in that vicinity.    The horses on the place were his pets, and he knew the peculiarities of  each as well as did the man who cared for them. Riding and driving came  to him as naturally as breathing, and the fact that a steed was  mettlesome did not daunt him.    \"My father often drove four-in-hand,\" he has said. \"I liked very much to  go with him, and I liked to drive, too.\"    Theodore Roosevelt's schoolboy days were not far out of the ordinary. He  studied hard, and if he failed in a lesson he did his best to make it up  the next time. It is well said that there is no royal road to learning,  and even a future President must study just as hard as his classmates if  he wants to keep up with them. Sometimes he was absent from school on  account of sickness, and then it was a sharp struggle to keep from  dropping behind.    \"In those days nobody expected Teddy Roosevelt "]]]
