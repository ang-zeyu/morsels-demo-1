This little opera, composed by Weber in his early youth and first  represented at Dresden under the composer's own direction, for a time  fell into utter oblivion, but has lately been reproduced.    Though short and unpretending it really deserves to be heard, the music  is so full of sweetness, so fresh and pretty.    The text is taken from a tale of the Arabian Thousand and One Nights,  and though full of nonsense, it amuses by its lightheartedness and  gaiety of spirit.    Abu Hassan, favorite of the Calif of Bagdad, has lived above his means,  and is now regaled with bread and water by his wife Fatima, whose only  fault is, that she sings better than she cooks.  In order to better his  fortunes Abu Hassan hits upon a strange plan.  He sends his wife to the  Calif's wife, Zobeide, to announce his (Hassan's) death, for which she  will obtain 50 gold pieces and a piece of brocade.  Fatima departs and  in the meantime enter Abu Hassan's creditors with the appeal for money.  Unable to satisfy them the debtor {2} approaches the eldest and richest  among them, and so pacifies him with sweet words which he is given to  understand Fatima has sent him, that old Omar consents to pay all the  creditors.    When they are gone, Fatima returns with Zobeide's presents, and Abu  Hassan prepares to go in his turn to the Calif, in order to repeat a  similar death-story about his wife and get a like sum.  While he is  away Omar reappears.  He has bought all Hassan's accounts from his  numerous creditors and offers them to Fatima for a kiss.  At this  moment the husband returns.  Omar is shut into the adjoining cabinet,  and the wife secretly points out the caged bird to her spouse who  begins to storm at finding the door of the next room closed, greatly to  the anguish of the old sinner Omar,--anguish, which is enjoyed by his  tormentors to the full."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2465"],[0,"Carmen (#3)"],[1,"to the _venta_.  Don Jose was still sound asleep, making up, no doubt, for the fatigue  and sleeplessness of several days of adventure. I had to shake him  roughly before I could wake him up. Never shall I forget his fierce  look, and the spring he made to get hold of his blunderbuss, which, as a  precautionary measure, I had removed to some distance from his couch.    \"Senor,\" I said, \"I beg your pardon for disturbing you. But I have a  silly question to ask you. Would you be glad to see half a dozen lancers  walk in here?\"    He bounded to his feet, and in an awful voice he demanded:    \"Who told you?\"    \"It's little matter whence the warning comes, so long as it be good.\"    \"Your guide has betrayed me--but he shall pay for it! Where is he?\"    \"I don't know. In the stable, I fancy. But somebody told me--\"    \"Who told you? It can't be the old hag--\"    \"Some one I don't know. Without more parleying, tell me, yes or no, have  you any reason for not waiting till the soldiers come? If you have  any, lose no time! If not, good-night to you, and forgive me for having  disturbed your slumbers!\"    \"Ah, your guide! Your guide! I had my doubts of him at first--but--I'll  settle with him! Farewell, senor. May God reward you for the service  I owe you! I am not quite so wicked as you think me. Yes, I still have  something in me that an honest man may pity. Farewell, senor! I have  only one regret--that I can not pay my debt to you!\"    \"As a reward for the service I have done you, Don Jose, promise me  you'll suspect nobody--nor seek for vengeance. Here are some cigars for  your journey. Good luck to you.\" And I held out my hand to him.    He squeezed it, without a word, took up his wallet and blunderbuss, and  after saying a few words to the old woman in a lingo that I could not  understand, he ran out to the shed. A few minutes later, I heard him  galloping out into the country.    As for me, I lay down again on my bench, but I did not go to sleep  again. I queried in my own mind whether I had done right to save a  robber, and possibly a murderer, from the gallows, simply and solely  because I had eaten ham and rice in his company. Had I not betrayed my  guide, who was supporting the cause of law and order? Had I not  exposed him to a ruffian's vengeance? But then, what about the laws of  hospitality?    \"A mere savage prejudice,\" said I to myself. \"I shall have to answer for  all the crimes this brigand may commit in future.\" Yet is that instinct  of the conscience which resists every argument really a prejudice? It  may be I could not have escaped from the delicate position in which I  found myself without remorse of some kind. I was still tossed to and  fro, in the greatest uncertainty as to the morality of my behaviour,  when I saw half a dozen horsemen ride up, with Antonio prudently lagging  behind them. I went to meet them, and told them the brigand had fled  over two hours previously. The old woman, when she was questioned by the  sergeant, admitted that she knew Navarro, but said that living alone,  as she did, she would never have dared to risk her life by informing  against him. She added that when he came to her house, he habitually  went away in the middle of the night. I, for my part, was made to ride  to a place some leagues away, where I showed my passport, and signed a  declaration before the _Alcalde_. This done, I was allowed to recommence  my archaeological investigations. Antonio was sulky with me; suspecting  it was I who had prevented his earning those two hundred ducats.  Nevertheless, we parted good friends at Cordova, where I gave him as  large a gratuity as the state of my finances would permit.        CHAPTER II    I spent several days at Cordova. I had been told of a certain manuscript  in the library of the Dominican convent which was likely to furnish me  with very interesting details about the ancient Munda. The good fathers  gave me the most kindly welcome. I spent the daylight hours within their  convent, and at night I walked about the town. At Cordova a great many  idlers collect, toward sunset, in the quay that runs along the right  bank of the Guadalquivir. Promenaders on the spot have to breathe the  odour of a tan yard which still keeps up the ancient fame of the country  in connection with the curing of leather. But to atone for this, they  enjoy a sight which has a charm of its own. A few minutes before the  Angelus bell rings, a great company of women gathers beside the river,  just below the quay, which is rather a high one. Not a man would dare  to join its ranks. The moment the Angelus rings, darkness is supposed to  have fallen. As the last stroke sounds, all the women disrobe and step  into the water. Then there is laughing and screaming and a wonderful  clatter. The men on the upper quay watch the bathers, straining  their eyes, and seeing very little. Yet the white uncertain outlines  perceptible against the dark-blue waters of the stream stir the poetic  mind, and the possessor of a little fancy finds it not difficult to  imagine that Diana and her nymphs are bathing below, while he himself  runs no risk of ending like Acteon.    I have been told that one day a party of good-for-nothing fellows banded  themselves together, and bribed the bell-ringer at the cathedral to ring  the Angelus some twenty minutes before the proper hour. Though it was  still broad daylight, the nymphs of the Guadalquivir never hesitated,  and putting far more trust in the Angelus bell than in the sun, they  proceeded to their bathing toilette--always of the simplest--with an  easy conscience. I was not present on that occasion. In my day, the  bell-ringer was incorruptible, the twilight was very dim, and nobody but  a cat could have distinguished the difference between the oldest orange  woman, and the prettiest shop-girl, in Cordova.    One evening, after it had grown quite dusk, I was leaning over the  parapet of the quay, smoking, when a woman came up the steps leading  from the river, and sat down near me. In her hair she wore a great  bunch of jasmine--a flower which, at night, exhales a most intoxicating  perfume. She was dressed simply, almost poorly, in black, as most  work-girls are dressed in the evening. Women of the richer class only  wear black in the daytime, at night they dress _a la francesa_. When she  drew near me, the woman let the mantilla which had covered her head  drop on her shoulders, and \"by the dim light falling from the stars\" I  perceived her to be young, short in stature, well-proportioned, and with  very large eyes. I threw my cigar away at once. She appreciated this  mark of courtesy, essentially French, and hastened to inform me that she  was very fond of the smell of tobacco, and that she even smoked herself,  when she could get very mild _papelitos_. I fortunately happened to have  some such in my case, and at once offered them to her. She condescended  to take one, and lighted it at a burning string which a child brought  us, receiving a copper for its pains. We mingled our smoke, and talked  so long, the fair lady and I, that we ended by being almost alone on  the quay. I thought I might venture, without impropriety, to suggest our  going to eat an ice at the _neveria_.* After a moment of modest demur,  she agreed. But before finally accepting, she desired to know what  o'clock it was. I struck my repeater, and this seemed to astound her  greatly.         * A _cafe_ to which a depot of ice, or rather of snow, is       attached. There is hardly a village in Spain without its       _neveria_.    \"What clever inventions you foreigners do have! What country do you  belong to, sir? You're an Englishman, no doubt!\"*         * Every traveller in Spain who does not carry about samples       of calicoes and silks is taken for an Englishman       (_inglesito_). It is the same thing in the East.    \"I'm a Frenchman, and your devoted servant. And you, senora, or  senorita, you probably belong to Cordova?\"    \"No.\"    \"At all events, you are an Andalusian? Your soft way of speaking makes  me think so.\"    \"If you notice people's accent so closely, you must be able to guess  what I am.\"    \"I think you are from the country of Jesus, two paces out of Paradise.\"    I had learned the metaphor, which stands for Andalusia, from my friend  Francisco Sevilla, a well-known _picador_.    \"Pshaw! The people here say there is no place in Paradise for us!\"    \"Then perhaps you are of Moorish blood--or----\" I stopped, not venturing  to add \"a Jewess.\"    \"Oh come! You must see I'm a gipsy! Wouldn't you like me to tell you _la  baji_?* Did you never hear tell of Carmencita? That's who I am!\"    * Your fortune.    I was such a miscreant in those days--now fifteen years ago--that the  close proximity of a sorceress did not make me recoil in horror. \"So be  it!\" I thought. \"Last week I ate my supper with a highway robber. To-day  I'll go and eat ices with a servant of the devil. A traveller should see  everything.\" I had yet another motive for prosecuting her acquaintance.  When I left college--I acknowledge it with shame--I had wasted a certain  amount of time in studying occult science, and had even attempted, more  than once, to exorcise the powers of darkness. Though I had been cured,  long since, of my passion for such investigations, I still felt a  certain attraction and curiosity with regard to all superstitions, and I  was delighted to have this opportunity of discovering how far the magic  art had developed among the gipsies.    Talking as we went, we had reached the _neveria_, and seated ourselves  at a little table, lighted by a taper protected by a glass globe. I then  had time to take a leisurely view of my _gitana_, while several  worthy individuals, who were eating their ices, stared open-mouthed at  beholding me in such gay company.    I very much doubt whether Senorita Carmen was a pure-blooded gipsy. At  all events, she was infinitely prettier than any other"]]]
