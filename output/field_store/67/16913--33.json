Urania, be it noted, is feminine, and never would the poetry  of the ancients have imagined a masculine symbol to personify the  pageant of the heavens. Not Uranus, nor Saturn, nor Jupiter can compare  with the ideal beauty of Urania.    Moreover, I have before me two delightful books, in breviary binding,  dated the one from the year 1686, the other from a century later, 1786.  The first was written by Fontenelle for a Marquise, and is entitled  Entretiens sur la Pluralite des Mondes. In this, banter is pleasantly  married with science, the author declaring that he only demands from his  fair readers the amount of application they would concede to a novel.  The second is written by Lalande, and is called Astronomie des Dames. In  addressing myself to both sexes, I am in honorable company with these  two sponsors and esteem myself the better for it.          CHAPTER I    THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HEAVENS      The crimson disk of the Sun has plunged beneath the Ocean. The sea has  decked itself with the burning colors of the orb, reflected from the  Heavens in a mirror of turquoise and emerald. The rolling waves are gold  and silver, and break noisily on a shore already darkened by the  disappearance of the celestial luminary.    We gaze regretfully after the star of day, that poured its cheerful rays  anon so generously over many who were intoxicated with gaiety and  happiness. We dream, contemplating the magnificent spectacle, and in  dreaming forget the moments that are rapidly flying by. Yet the darkness  gradually increases, and twilight gives way to night.    The most indifferent spectator of the setting Sun as it descends beneath  the waves at the far horizon, could hardly be unmoved by the pageant of  Nature at such an impressive moment.    The light of the Crescent Moon, like some fairy boat suspended in the  sky, is bright enough to cast changing and dancing sparkles of silver  upon the ocean. The Evening Star declines slowly in its turn toward the  western horizon. Our gaze is held by a shining world that dominates the  whole of the occidental heavens. This is the \"Shepherd's Star,\" Venus of  rays translucent.    Little by little, one by one, the more brilliant stars shine out. Here  are the white Vega of the Lyre, the burning Arcturus, the seven stars of  the Great Bear, a whole sidereal population catching fire, like  innumerable eyes that open on the Infinite. It is a new life that is  revealed to our imagination, inviting us to soar into these mysterious  regions.    O Night, diapered with fires innumerable! hast thou not written in  flaming letters on these Constellations the syllables of the great  enigma of Eternity? The contemplation of thee is a wonder and a charm.  How rapidly canst thou efface the regrets we suffered on the departure  of our beloved Sun! What wealth, what beauty hast thou not reserved for  our enraptured souls! Where is the man that can remain blind to such a  pageant and deaf to its language!    To whatever quarter of the Heavens we look, the splendors of the night  are revealed to our astonished gaze. These celestial eyes seem in their  turn to gaze at, and to question us. Thus indeed have they questioned  every thinking soul, so long as Humanity has existed on our Earth. Homer  saw and sung these self-same stars. They shone upon the slow succession  of civilizations that have disappeared, from Egypt of the period of the  Pyramids, Greece at the time of the Trojan War, Rome and Carthage,  Constantine and Charlemagne, down to the Twentieth Century. The  generations are buried with the dust of their ancient temples. The Stars  are still there, symbols of Eternity.    The silence of the vast and starry Heavens may terrify us; its immensity  may seem to overwhelm us. But our inquiring thought flies curiously on  the wings of dream, toward the remotest regions of the visible. It rests  on one star and another, like the butterfly on the flower. It seeks what  will best respond to its aspirations: and thus a kind of communication  is established, and, as it were, protected by all Nature in these silent  appeals. Our sense of solitude has disappeared. We feel that, if only as  infinitesimal atoms, we form part of that immense universe, and this  dumb language of the starry night is more eloquent than any speech. Each  star becomes a friend, a discreet confidant, often indeed a precious  counsellor, for all the thoughts it suggests to us are pure and holy.    Is any poem finer than the book written in letters of fire upon the  tablets of the firmament? Nothing could be more ideal. And yet, the  poetic sentiment that the beauty of Heaven awakens in our soul ought  not to veil its reality from us. That is no less marvelous than the  mystery by which we were enchanted.    And here we may ask ourselves how many there are, even among thinking  human beings, who ever raise their eyes to the starry heavens? How many  men and women are sincerely, and with unfeigned curiosity, interested in  these shining specks, and inaccessible luminaries, and really desirous  of a better acquaintance with them?    Seek, talk, ask in the intercourse of daily life. You, who read these  pages, who already love the Heavens, and comprehend them, who desire to  account for our existence in this world, who seek to know what the Earth  is, and what Heaven--you shall witness that the number of those  inquiring after truth is so limited that no one dares to speak of it, so  disgraceful is it to the so-called intelligence of our race. And yet!  the great Book of the Heavens is open to all eyes. What pleasures await  us in the study of the Universe! Nothing could speak more eloquently to  our heart and intellect!    Astronomy is the science _par excellence_. It is the most beautiful and  most ancient of all, inasmuch as it dates back to the indeterminate  times of highest antiquity. Its mission is not only to make us  acquainted with the innumerable orbs by which our nights are  illuminated, but it is, moreover, thanks to it that we know where and  what we are. Without it we should live as the blind, in eternal  ignorance of the very conditions of our terrestrial existence. Without  it we should still be penetrated with the naive error that reduced the  entire Universe to our minute globule, making our Humanity the goal of  the Creation, and should have no exact notion of the immense reality.    To-day, thanks to the intellectual labor of so many centuries, thanks  also to the immortal genius of the men of science who have devoted their  lives to searching after Truth--men such as Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler,  Newton--the veil of ignorance has been rent, and glimpses of the marvels  of creation are perceptible in their splendid truth to the dazzled eye  of the thinker.    The study of Astronomy is not, as many suppose, the sacrifice of oneself  in a cerebral torture that obliterates all the beauty, the fascination,  and the grandeur of the pageant of Nature. Figures, and naught but  figures, would not be entertaining, even to those most desirous of  instruction. Let the reader take courage! We do not propose that he  shall decipher the hieroglyphics of algebra and geometry. Perish the  thought! For the rest, figures are but the scaffolding, the method, and  do not exist in Nature.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--The great Book of the Heavens is open to all  eyes.]    We simply beg of you to open your eyes, to see where you are, so that  you may not stray from the path of truth, which is also the path of  happiness. Once you have entered upon it, no persuasion will be needed  to make you persevere. And you will have the profound satisfaction of  knowing that you are thinking correctly, and that it is infinitely  better to be educated than to be ignorant. The reality is far beyond all  dreams, beyond the most fantastic imagination. The most fairy-like  transformations of our theaters, the most resplendent pageants of our  military reviews, the most sumptuous marvels on which the human race can  pride itself--all that we admire, all that we envy on the Earth--is as  nothing compared with the unheard-of wonders scattered through  Infinitude. There are so many that one does not know how to see them.  The fascinated eye would fain grasp all at once.    If you will yield yourselves to the pleasure of gazing upon the  sparkling fires of Space, you will never regret the moments passed all  too rapidly in the contemplation of the Heavens.    Diamonds, turquoises, rubies, emeralds, all the precious stones with  which women love to deck themselves, are to be found in greater  perfection, more beautiful, and more splendid, set in the immensity of  Heaven! In the telescopic field, we may watch the progress of armies of  majestic and powerful suns, from whose attacks there is naught to fear.  And these vagabond comets and shooting stars and stellar nebulae, do they  not make up a prodigious panorama? What are our romances in comparison  with the History of Nature? Soaring toward the Infinite, we purify our  souls from all the baseness of this world, we strive to become better  and more intelligent.           *       *       *       *       *    But in the first place, you ask, what are the Heavens? This vault  oppresses us. We can not venture to investigate it.    Heaven, we reply, is no vault, it is a limitless immensity,  inconceivable, unfathomable, that surrounds us on all sides, and in the  midst of which our globe is floating.

I inquired if she were the mother  of those pretty children. \"Yes,\" she said; and, giving the eldest a  piece of bread, she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with  a mother's tenderness. \"I left my child in Philip's care,\" she said,  \"whilst I went into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheaten  bread, some sugar, and an earthen pot.\" I saw the various articles in  the basket, from which the cover had fallen. \"I shall make some broth  to-night for my little Hans (which was the name of the youngest):  that wild fellow, the big one, broke my pot yesterday, whilst he was  scrambling with Philip for what remained of the contents.\" I inquired  for the eldest; and she had scarcely time to tell me that he was driving  a couple of geese home from the meadow, when he ran up, and handed  Philip an osier-twig. I talked a little longer with the woman, and found  that she was the daughter of the schoolmaster, and that her husband was  gone on a journey into Switzerland for some money a relation had left  him. \"They wanted to cheat him,\" she said, \"and would not answer  his letters; so he is gone there himself. I hope he has met with no  accident, as I have heard nothing of him since his departure.\" I left  the woman, with regret, giving each of the children a kreutzer, with an  additional one for the youngest, to buy some wheaten bread for his broth  when she went to town next; and so we parted. I assure you, my dear  friend, when my thoughts are all in tumult, the sight of such a  creature as this tranquillises my disturbed mind. She moves in a  happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her existence; she  supplies her wants from day to day; and, when she sees the leaves fall,  they raise no other idea in her mind than that winter is approaching.  Since that time I have gone out there frequently. The children have  become quite familiar with me; and each gets a lump of sugar when I  drink my coffee, and they share my milk and bread and butter in the  evening. They always receive their kreutzer on Sundays, for the good  woman has orders to give it to them when I do not go there after evening  service. They are quite at home with me, tell me everything; and I am  particularly amused with observing their tempers, and the simplicity of  their behaviour, when some of the other village children are assembled  with them.    It has given me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of the mother,  lest (as she says) \"they should inconvenience the gentleman.\"    MAY 30.    What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect to  poetry. It is only necessary for us to know what is really excellent,  and venture to give it expression; and that is saying much in few words.  To-day I have had a scene, which, if literally related, would, make the  most beautiful idyl in the world. But why should I talk of poetry and  scenes and idyls? Can we never take pleasure in nature without having  recourse to art?    If you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction,  you will be sadly mistaken. It relates merely to a peasant-lad, who  has excited in me the warmest interest. As usual, I shall tell my story  badly; and you, as usual, will think me extravagant. It is Walheim once  more--always Walheim--which produces these wonderful phenomena.    A party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees, to drink  coffee. The company did not exactly please me; and, under one pretext or  another, I lingered behind.    A peasant came from an adjoining house, and set to work arranging some  part of the same plough which I had lately sketched. His appearance  pleased me; and I spoke to him, inquired about his circumstances, made  his acquaintance, and, as is my wont with persons of that class, was  soon admitted into his confidence. He said he was in the service of  a young widow, who set great store by him. He spoke so much of his  mistress, and praised her so extravagantly, that I could soon see he was  desperately in love with her. \"She is no longer young,\" he said: \"and  she was treated so badly by her former husband that she does not mean  to marry again.\" From his account it was so evident what incomparable  charms she possessed for him, and how ardently he wished she would  select him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband's  misconduct, that I should have to repeat his own words in order to  describe the depth of the poor fellow's attachment, truth, and devotion.  It would, in fact, require the gifts of a great poet to convey the  expression of his features, the harmony of his voice, and the heavenly  fire of his eye. No words can portray the tenderness of his every  movement and of every feature: no effort of mine could do justice to the  scene. His alarm lest I should misconceive his position with regard  to his mistress, or question the propriety of her conduct, touched me  particularly. The charming manner with which he described her form and  person, which, without possessing the graces of youth, won and attached  him to her, is inexpressible, and must be left to the imagination. I  have never in my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility  of such intense devotion, such ardent affections, united with so much  purity. Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of this innocence  and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul; that this picture of  fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere; and that my own heart, as  though enkindled by the flame, glows and burns within me.    I mean now to try and see her as soon as I can: or perhaps, on second  thoughts, I had better not; it is better I should behold her through the  eyes of her lover. To my sight, perhaps, she would not appear as she now  stands before me; and why should I destroy so sweet a picture?    JUNE 16.    \"Why do I not write to you?\" You lay claim to learning, and ask such a  question. You should have guessed that I am well--that is to say--in a  word, I have made an acquaintance who has won my heart: I have--I know  not.    To give you a regular account of the manner in which I have become  acquainted with the most amiable of women would be a difficult task. I  am a happy and contented mortal, but a poor historian.    An angel! Nonsense! Everybody so describes his mistress; and yet I find  it impossible to tell you how perfect she is, or why she is so perfect:  suffice it to say she has captivated all my senses.    So much simplicity with so much understanding--so mild, and yet so  resolute--a mind so placid, and a life so active.    But all this is ugly balderdash, which expresses not a single character  nor feature. Some other time--but no, not some other time, now, this  very instant, will I tell you all about it. Now or never. Well, between  ourselves, since I commenced my letter, I have been three times on the  point of throwing down my pen, of ordering my horse, and riding out.  And yet I vowed this morning that I would not ride to-day, and yet every  moment I am rushing to the window to see how high the sun is.    I could not restrain myself--go to her I must. I have just returned,  Wilhelm; and whilst I am taking supper I will write to you. What  a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midst of her dear,  beautiful children,--eight brothers and sisters!    But, if I proceed thus, you will be no wiser at the end of my letter  than you were at the beginning. Attend, then, and I will compel myself  to give you the details.    I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with S--,  the district judge, and that he had invited me to go and visit him in  his retirement, or rather in his little kingdom. But I neglected going,  and perhaps should never have gone, if chance had not discovered to me  the treasure which lay concealed in that retired spot. Some of our young  people had proposed giving a ball in the country, at which I consented  to be present. I offered my hand for the evening to a pretty and  agreeable, but rather commonplace, sort of girl from the immediate  neighbourhood; and it was agreed that I should engage a carriage, and  call upon Charlotte, with my partner and her aunt, to convey them to the  ball. My companion informed me, as we drove along through the park  to the hunting-lodge, that I should make the acquaintance of a very  charming young lady. \"Take care,\" added the aunt, \"that you do not lose  your heart.\" \"Why?\" said I. \"Because she is already engaged to a very  worthy man,\" she replied, \"who is gone to settle his affairs upon  the death of his father, and will succeed to a very considerable  inheritance.\" This information possessed no interest for me. When  we arrived at the gate, the sun was setting behind the tops of the  mountains. The atmosphere was heavy; and the ladies expressed their  fears of an approaching storm, as masses of low black clouds were  gathering in the horizon. I relieved their anxieties by pretending to be  weather-wise, although I myself had some apprehensions lest our pleasure  should be interrupted.    I alighted; and a maid came to the door, and requested us to wait a  moment for her mistress. I walked across the court to a well-built  house, and, ascending the flight of steps in front, opened the door,  and saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed. Six  children, from eleven to two years old, were running about the hall, and  surrounding a lady of middle height, with a lovely figure, dressed in a  robe of simple white, trimmed with pink ribbons. She was holding a rye  loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for the little ones all around,  in proportion to their age and appetite. She performed her task in a  graceful and affectionate manner; each claimant awaiting his turn with  outstretched hands, and boisterously shouting his thanks. Some of them  ran away at once, to"]]]
