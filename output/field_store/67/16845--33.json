It set me wondering if perhaps his language wasn't like the  primitive speech of some earth people--you know, Captain, like the  Negritoes, for instance, who haven't any generic words. No word for food  or water or man--words for good food and bad food, or rain water and sea  water, or strong man and weak man--but no names for general classes.  They're too primitive to understand that rain water and sea water are  just different aspects of the same thing. But that wasn't the case with  Tweel; it was just that we were somehow mysteriously different--our  minds were alien to each other. And yet--we _liked_ each other!\"    \"Looney, that's all,\" remarked Harrison. \"That's why you two were so  fond of each other.\"    \"Well, I like _you_!\" countered Jarvis wickedly. \"Anyway,\" he resumed,  \"don't get the idea that there was anything screwy about Tweel. In fact,  I'm not so sure but that he couldn't teach our highly praised human  intelligence a trick or two. Oh, he wasn't an intellectual superman, I  guess; but don't overlook the point that he managed to understand a  little of my mental workings, and I never even got a glimmering of his.\"    \"Because he didn't have any!\" suggested the captain, while Putz and  Leroy blinked attentively.    \"You can judge of that when I'm through,\" said Jarvis. \"Well, we plugged  along across the Mare Chronium all that day, and all the next. Mare  Chronium--Sea of Time! Say, I was willing to agree with Schiaparelli's  name by the end of that march! Just that grey, endless plain of weird  plants, and never a sign of any other life. It was so monotonous that I  was even glad to see the desert of Xanthus toward the evening of the  second day.    \"I was fair worn out, but Tweel seemed as fresh as ever, for all I never  saw him drink or eat. I think he could have crossed the Mare Chronium in  a couple of hours with those block-long nose dives of his, but he stuck  along with me. I offered him some water once or twice; he took the cup  from me and sucked the liquid into his beak, and then carefully squirted  it all back into the cup and gravely returned it.    \"Just as we sighted Xanthus, or the cliffs that bounded it, one of those  nasty sand clouds blew along, not as bad as the one we had here, but  mean to travel against. I pulled the transparent flap of my thermo-skin  bag across my face and managed pretty well, and I noticed that Tweel  used some feathery appendages growing like a mustache at the base of his  beak to cover his nostrils, and some similar fuzz to shield his eyes.\"    \"He is a desert creature!\" ejaculated the little biologist, Leroy.    \"Huh? Why?\"    \"He drink no water--he is adapt' for sand storm--\"    \"Proves nothing! There's not enough water to waste any where on this  desiccated pill called Mars. We'd call all of it desert on earth, you  know.\" He paused. \"Anyway, after the sand storm blew over, a little wind  kept blowing in our faces, not strong enough to stir the sand. But  suddenly things came drifting along from the Xanthus cliffs--small,  transparent spheres, for all the world like glass tennis balls! But  light--they were almost light enough to float even in this thin  air--empty, too; at least, I cracked open a couple and nothing came out  but a bad smell. I asked Tweel about them, but all he said was 'No, no,  no,' which I took to mean that he knew nothing about them. So they went  bouncing by like tumbleweeds, or like soap bubbles, and we plugged on  toward Xanthus. Tweel pointed at one of the crystal balls once and said  'rock,' but I was too tired to argue with him. Later I discovered what  he meant.    \"We came to the bottom of the Xanthus cliffs finally, when there wasn't  much daylight left. I decided to sleep on the plateau if possible;  anything dangerous, I reasoned, would be more likely to prowl through  the vegetation of the Mare Chronium than the sand of Xanthus. Not that  I'd seen a single sign of menace, except the rope-armed black thing that  had trapped Tweel, and apparently that didn't prowl at all, but lured  its victims within reach. It couldn't lure me while I slept, especially  as Tweel didn't seem to sleep at all, but simply sat patiently around  all night. I wondered how the creature had managed to trap Tweel, but  there wasn't any way of asking him. I found that out too, later; it's  devilish!    \"However, we were ambling around the base of the Xanthus barrier looking  for an easy spot to climb. At least, I was. Tweel could have leaped it  easily, for the cliffs were lower than Thyle--perhaps sixty feet. I  found a place and started up, swearing at the water tank strapped to my  back--it didn't bother me except when climbing--and suddenly I heard a  sound that I thought I recognized!    \"You know how deceptive sounds are in this thin air. A shot sounds like  the pop of a cork. But this sound was the drone of a rocket, and sure  enough, there went our second auxiliary about ten miles to westward,  between me and the sunset!\"    \"Vas me!\" said Putz. \"I hunt for you.\"    \"Yeah; I knew that, but what good did it do me? I hung on to the cliff  and yelled and waved with one hand. Tweel saw it too, and set up a  trilling and twittering, leaping to the top of the barrier and then high  into the air. And while I watched, the machine droned on into the  shadows to the south.    \"I scrambled to the top of the cliff. Tweel was still pointing and  trilling excitedly, shooting up toward the sky and coming down head-on  to stick upside down on his beak in the sand. I pointed toward the south  and at myself, and he said, 'Yes--Yes--Yes'; but somehow I gathered that  he thought the flying thing was a relative of mine, probably a parent.  Perhaps I did his intellect an injustice; I think now that I did.    \"I was bitterly disappointed by the failure to attract attention. I  pulled out my thermo-skin bag and crawled into it, as the night chill  was already apparent. Tweel stuck his beak into the sand and drew up his  legs and arms and looked for all the world like one of those leafless  shrubs out there. I think he stayed that way all night.\"    \"Protective mimicry!\" ejaculated Leroy. \"See? He is desert creature!\"    \"In the morning,\" resumed Jarvis, \"we started off again. We hadn't gone  a hundred yards into Xanthus when I saw something queer! This is one  thing Putz didn't photograph, I'll wager!    \"There was a line of little pyramids--tiny ones, not more than six  inches high, stretching across Xanthus as far as I could see! Little  buildings made of pygmy bricks, they were, hollow inside and truncated,  or at least broken at the top and empty. I pointed at them and said  'What?' to Tweel, but he gave some negative twitters to indicate, I  suppose, that he didn't know. So off we went, following the row of  pyramids because they ran north, and I was going north.    \"Man, we trailed that line for hours! After a while, I noticed another  queer thing: they were getting larger. Same number of bricks in each  one, but the bricks were larger.    \"By noon they were shoulder high. I looked into a couple--all just the  same, broken at the top and empty. I examined a brick or two as well;  they were silica, and old as creation itself!\"    \"How you know?\" asked Leroy.    \"They were weathered--edges rounded. Silica doesn't weather easily even  on earth, and in this climate--!\"    \"How old you think?\"    \"Fifty thousand--a hundred thousand years. How can I tell? The little  ones we saw in the morning were older--perhaps ten times as old.  Crumbling. How old would that make _them_? Half a million years? Who  knows?\" Jarvis paused a moment. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"we followed the  line. Tweel pointed at them and said 'rock' once or twice, but he'd done  that many times before. Besides, he was more or less right about these.    \"I tried questioning him. I pointed at a pyramid and asked 'People?' and  indicated the two of us. He set up a negative sort of clucking and said,  'No, no, no. No one-one-two. No two-two-four,' meanwhile rubbing his  stomach. I just stared at him and he went through the business again.  'No one-one-two. No two-two-four.' I just gaped at him.\"    \"That proves it!\" exclaimed Harrison. \"Nuts!\"    \"You think so?\" queried Jarvis sardonically. \"Well, I figured it out  different! 'No one-one-two!' You don't get it, of course, do you?\"    \"Nope--nor do you!\"    \"I think I do! Tweel was using the few English words he knew to put over  a very complex idea. What, let me ask, does mathematics make you think  of?\"    \"Why--of astronomy. Or--or logic!\"    \"That's it! 'No one-one-two!' Tweel was telling me that the builders of  the pyramids weren't people--or that they weren't intelligent, that they  weren't reasoning creatures! Get it?\"    \"Huh! I'll be damned!\"    \"You probably will.\"    \"Why,\" put in Leroy, \"he rub his belly?\"    \"Why? Because, my dear biologist, that's where his brains are! Not in  his tiny head--in his middle!\"    \"_C'est_ impossible!\"    \"Not on Mars, it isn't! This flora and fauna aren't earthly; your  biopods prove that!\" Jarvis grinned and took up his narrative. \"Anyway,  we plugged along across Xanthus and in about the middle of the  afternoon, something else queer happened. The pyramids ended.\"    \"Ended!\"    \"Yeah; the queer part was that the last one--and now they were  ten-footers--was capped! See? Whatever built it was still inside; we'd  trailed 'em from their half-million-year-old origin to the present.    \"Tweel and I noticed it about the same time. I yanked out my automatic  (I had a clip of Boland explosive bullets in it) and Tweel, quick as a  sleight-of-hand trick, snapped a queer little glass revolver out of his  bag. It was much like our weapons, except that the grip was larger to  accommodate his four-taloned hand.

Republican opponents, Madison among them, were brought around by the  plea that war had proved a national bank a necessary and hence a  constitutional helper of the Government in its appointed work.    In the management of this second bank there were disorder and  dishonesty, which greatly limited its usefulness. This, notwithstanding,  was considerable. The credit of the nation was restored and its treasury  resumed specie payments. But confidence in the institution was shaken.  We shall see how it met with President Jackson's opposition on every  possible occasion. In 1832 he vetoed a bill for the renewal of its  charter, to expire in 1836, and in 1833 caused all the Government's  deposits in it, amounting to ten million dollars, to be removed. These  blows were fatal to the bank, though it secured a charter from  Pennsylvania and existed, languishing, till 1839.    III. The Tariff.    Until the War of 1812 the main purpose of our tariff policy had been  revenue, with protection only as an incident. During the war  manufacturing became largely developed, partly through our own embargo,  partly through the armed hostilities. Manufacture had grown to be an  extensive interest, comparing in importance with agriculture and  commerce. Therefore, in the new tariff of 1816, the old relation was  reversed, protection being made the main aim and revenue the incident.  It is curious to note that this first protective tariff was championed  and passed by the Republicans and bitterly opposed by the Federalists  and incipient Whigs. Webster argued and inveighed vehemently against it,  appealing to the curse of commercial restriction and of governmental  interference with trade, and to the low character of manufacturing  populations.    But very soon the tables were turned: the Whigs became the high-tariff  party, the Democrats more and more opposing this policy in favor of a  low or a revenue tariff. It should be marked that even now the idea of  protection in its modern form was not the only one which went to make a  high tariff popular. There were, besides, the wish to be prepared for  war by the home production of war material, and also the spirit of  commercial retortion, paying back in her own coin England's burdensome  tax upon our exports to her shores.    IV. Land.    What may not improperly be styled the whig land policy sprung from the  whig sentiment for large customs duties. Cheap public lands, offering  each poor man a home for the taking, constantly tended to neutralize the  effect of duties, by raising wages in the manufacturing sections, people  needing a goodly bribe to enter mills in the East when an abundant  living was theirs without money and without price on removing west. As a  rule, therefore, though this question did not divide the two parties so  crisply as the others, the Whigs opposed the free sale of government  land, while the Democrats favored that policy. In spite of this,  however, eastern people who moved westward--and they constituted the  West's main population--quite commonly retained their whig politics even  upon the tariff question itself.    V. Internal Improvements.    It has always been admitted that Congress may lay taxes to build and  improve light-houses, public docks, and all such properties whereof the  United States is to hold the title. The general improvement of harbors,  on the other hand, the Constitution meant to leave to the States,  allowing each to cover the expense by levying tonnage duties. The  practice for years corresponded with this. The inland commonwealths,  however, as they were admitted, justly regarded this unfair unless  offset by Government's aid to them in the construction of roads, canals,  and river ways.      [Illustration: Large sprawling residence.]  Webster's Home at Marshfield. Mass.      The War of 1812 revealed the need of better means for direct  communication with the remote sections of the Union. Transportation to  Detroit had cost fifty cents per pound of ammunition, sixty dollars per  barrel of flour. All admitted that improved internal routes were  necessary. The question was whether the general Government had a right  to construct them without amendment to the Constitution.    The Whigs, like the old Federalists, affirmed such right, appealing to  Congress's power to establish post-roads, wage war, supervise  inter-state trade, and conserve the common defence and general welfare.  As a rule, the Democrats, being strict constructionists, denied such  right. Some of them justified outlay upon national rivers and commercial  harbors under the congressional power of raising revenue and regulating  commerce. Others conceded the rightfulness of subsidies to States even  for bettering inland routes. Treasury surplus at times, and the many  appropriations which, by common consent, had been made under Monroe and  later for the old National Road, encouraged the whig contention; but the  whig policy had never met general approval down to the time when the  whole question was taken out of politics by the rise of the railroad  system after 1832. The National Road, meantime, extending across Ohio  and Indiana on its way to St. Louis, was made over in 1830 to the States  through which it passed.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Daniel Webster. From a picture by Healy at the State Department,  Washington.      The Whig Party deserves great praise as the especial repository, through  several decades, of the spirit of nationality in our country. It  cherished this, and with the utmost boldness proclaimed doctrines  springing from it, at a time when the Democracy, for no other reason  than that it had begun as a state rights party, foolishly combated  these. Yet Whiggism was mightier in theories than in deeds, in political  cunning than in statesmanship. It was far too fearful, on the whole,  lest the country should not be sufficiently governed. To secure power it  allied itself now with the Anti-Masons, strong after 1826 in New  England, New York, and Pennsylvania; and again with the Nullifiers of  South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, led by Calhoun, Troup, and  White. It did the latter by making Tyler, an out-and-out Nullifier, its  Vice-President in 1840.    A leading Whig during nearly all his political career was John Quincy  Adams, one of the ablest, most patriotic, and most successful presidents  this country has ever had. He possessed a thorough education, mainly  acquired abroad, where, sojourning with his distinguished father, he had  enjoyed while still a youth better opportunities for diplomatic training  than many of our diplomatists have known in a lifetime. He went to the  United States Senate in 1803 as a Federalist. Disgusted with that party,  he turned Republican, losing his place. From 1806 to 1809 he was  professor in Harvard College. In the latter year Madison sent him  Minister to St. Petersburg. He was commissioner at Ghent, then Minister  to England, then Monroe's Secretary of State, then President.    [Illustration: Small house.]  The House in which Henry Clay was Born.      But Mr. Adams's best work was done in the House of Representatives after  he was elected to that body in 1830. He sat in the House until his  death, in 1848--its acknowledged leader in ability, in activity, and in  debate. Friend and foe hailed him as the \"Old Man Eloquent,\" nor were  any there anxious to be pitted against him. He spoke upon almost every  great national question, each time displaying general knowledge; legal  lore, and keenness of analysis surpassed by no American of his or any  age.    Webster was, however, the great orator of the party. Reared upon a farm  and educated at Dartmouth College, he went to Congress from New  Hampshire as a Federalist in 1813. Removing to Boston, he soon entered  Congress from Massachusetts, first as representative, then as senator,  and from 1827 was in the Senate almost continuously till 1850. He was  Secretary of State under Harrison and Tyler, and again in the  Taylor-Fillmore cabinet from 1850.      [Illustration: One room log building.]  The School-house of the Slashes.      As an orator Webster had no peer in his time, nor have the years since  evoked his peer. He was an influential party leader, and repeatedly  thought of for President, though too prominent ever to be nominated. On  two momentous questions, the tariff and slavery, he vacillated, his  dubious action concerning the latter costing him his popularity in New  England.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Henry Clay. From a photograph by Rockwood of an old daguerreotype.      Yet in many respects the most interesting figure in the party was Henry  Clay. He was born amid the swamps of Hanover County, Va., and had grown  up in most adverse surroundings. His father, a Baptist clergyman, died  while he was an infant, leaving him destitute. In \"The Slashes,\" as the  neighborhood where Clay passed his childhood was called, he might often  have been seen astride a sorry horse with a rope bridle and no saddle,  carrying his bag of grain to the mill. He had attended only district  schools. After obtaining the rudiments of a legal education in Richmond  by service as a lawyer's clerk, he removed to Kentucky. He was soon  famous as a criminal lawyer, and a little later as a politician. The  rest of his life was spent in Congress or cabinet.    Clay's speeches read ill, but were powerful in their delivery. He spoke  directly to the heart. As he proceeded, his tall and awkward form swayed  with passion. His voice was sweet and winsome. Once Tom Marshall was to  face him in joint debate over a salary grab for which Clay had voted.  Clay had the first word, and as he warmed to his work Marshall slunk  away through the crowd in despair. \"Come back,\" said Clay's haters to  him; \"you can answer every point.\" \"Of course,\" replied Marshall, \"but I  can't get up there and do it now.\" The common"]]]
