The view from the spacious terrace on the verge of the cliffs of  Quebec, the ancient capital of Canada, cannot fail to impress the  imagination of the statesman or student versed in the history of the  American continent, as well as delight the eye of the lover of the  picturesque.  Below the heights, to whose rocks and buildings cling so  many memories of the past, flows the St. Lawrence, the great river of  Canada, bearing to the Atlantic the waters of the numerous lakes and  streams of the valley which was first discovered and explored by  France, and in which her statesmen saw the elements of empire.  We see  the tinned roofs, spires and crosses of quaint churches, hospitals and  convents, narrow streets winding among the rocks, black-robed priests  and {2} sombre nuns, _habitans_ in homespun from the neighbouring  villages, modest gambrel-roofed houses of the past crowded almost out  of sight by obtrusive lofty structures of the present, the massive  buildings of the famous seminary and university which bear the name of  Laval, the first great bishop of that Church which has always dominated  French Canada.  Not far from the edge of the terrace stands a monument  on which are inscribed the names of Montcalm and Wolfe, enemies in life  but united in death and fame.  Directly below is the market which  recalls the name of Champlain, the founder of Quebec, and his first  Canadian home at the margin of the river.  On the same historic ground  we see the high-peaked roof and antique spire of the curious old  church, Notre-Dame des Victoires, which was first built to commemorate  the repulse of an English fleet two centuries ago.  Away beyond, to the  left, we catch a glimpse of the meadows and cottages of the beautiful  Isle of Orleans, and directly across the river are the rocky hills  covered with the buildings of the town, which recalls the services of  Levis, whose fame as a soldier is hardly overshadowed by that of  Montcalm.  The Union-jack floats on the tall staff of the citadel which  crowns the summit of Cape Diamond, but English voices are lost amid  those of a people who still speak the language of France.    As we recall the story of these heights, we can see passing before us a  picturesque procession: Sailors from the home of maritime enterprise on  the Breton and Biscayan coasts, Indian warriors in their paint and  savage finery, gentlemen-adventurers and pioneers, {3} rovers of the  forest and river, statesmen and soldiers of high ambition, gentle and  cultured women who gave up their lives to alleviate suffering and teach  the young, missionaries devoted to a faith for which many have died.  In the famous old castle of Saint Louis,[1] long since levelled to the  ground--whose foundations are beneath a part of this very  terrace--statesmen feasted and dreamt of a French Empire in North  America.  Then the French dominion passed away with the fall of Quebec,  and the old English colonies were at last relieved from that pressure  which had confined them so long to the Atlantic coast, and enabled to  become free commonwealths with great possibilities of development  before them.  Yet, while England lost so much in America by the War of  Independence, there still remained to her a vast northern territory,  stretching far to the east and west from Quebec, and containing all the  rudiments of national life--      \"The raw materials of a State,      Its muscle and its mind.\"      A century later than that Treaty of Paris which was signed in the  palace of Versailles, and ceded Canada finally to England, the  statesmen of the provinces of this northern territory, which was still  a British possession,--statesmen of French as well as English  Canada--assembled in an old building of this same city, so rich in  memories of old France, {4} and took the first steps towards the  establishment of that Dominion, which, since then, has reached the  Pacific shores.    It is the story of this Canadian Dominion, of its founders, explorers,  missionaries, soldiers, and statesmen, that I shall attempt to relate  briefly in the following pages, from the day the Breton sailor ascended  the St. Lawrence to Hochelaga until the formation of the confederation,  which united the people of two distinct nationalities and extends over  so wide a region--so far beyond the Acadia and Canada which France once  called her own.  But that the story may be more intelligible from the  beginning, it is necessary to give a bird's-eye view of the country,  whose history is contemporaneous with that of the United States, and  whose territorial area from Cape Breton to Vancouver--the sentinel  islands of the Atlantic and Pacific approaches--is hardly inferior to  that of the federal republic.    Although the population of Canada at present does not exceed nine  millions of souls, the country has, within a few years, made great  strides in the path of national development, and fairly takes a place  of considerable importance among those nations whose stories have been  already told; whose history goes back to centuries when the Laurentian  Hills, those rocks of primeval times, looked down on an unbroken  wilderness of forest and stretches of silent river.  If we treat the  subject from a strictly historical point of view, the confederation of  provinces and territories comprised within the Dominion may be most  conveniently grouped into {5} several distinct divisions.  Geographers  divide the whole country lying between the two oceans into three  well-defined regions: 1. The Eastern, extending from the Atlantic to  the head of Lake Superior.  2. The Central, stretching across the  prairies and plains to the base of the Rocky Mountains.  3. The  Western, comprising that sea of mountains which at last unites with the  waters of the Pacific.  For the purposes of this narrative, however,  the Eastern and largest division--also the oldest historically--must be  separated into two distinct divisions, known as Acadia and Canada in  the early annals of America.    The first division of the Eastern region now comprises the provinces of  Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, which, formerly,  with a large portion of the State of Maine, were best known as  Acadie,[2] a memorial of the Indian occupation before the French  regime.  These provinces are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#3)"],[1,"the six suns. Here and there were  groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled  so brightly.    \"I'm sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"We are  falling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land, and  this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"    \"We'll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan.    \"Oh, I'm not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"But don't let us worry  over such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you know, and  I've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.\"    The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon  both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out  below them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big  city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointed  spires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled  upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.    Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight  up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. But  no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stop  at last.    When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs  trembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out  of the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kicked  over Dorothy's birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that the  bottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, sat  down upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes.    \"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"There's Eureka.\"    \"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.    \"Eureka isn't pink; she's white. It's this queer light that gives her  that color.\"    \"Where's my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.  \"I'm 'most starved to death.\"    \"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"    \"Talk! Am I talking? Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn't it funny?\"  asked the kitten.    \"It's all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. But  even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.\"    \"I can't see that it's wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"At  least, it isn't as wrong as some other things. What's going to become of  us now?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously.    The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent  that one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.  Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used  for rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queer  forms huddled into the corners of these rooms.    The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of  glass were lying scattered in every direction. A near by steeple had  been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Other  buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;  but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had  happened to mar their perfection. The rainbow tints from the colored  suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many  delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.    But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had  arrived, except that of their own voices. They began to wonder if there  were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world.    Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they  were on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, but  was well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face of  a fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously  colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams  touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.    The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed  the presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. There was  no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he  must have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had rested  upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to  the furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder to  gaze at the strange animal.    \"Look out!\" cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not  look where he was going; \"be careful, or you'll fall off!\"    But he paid no attention to her warning. He reached the edge of the tall  roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly  as if he were on firm ground.    The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, and  saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon he  reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of  the glass buildings.    \"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.    \"Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it _is_ strange,\" remarked the small  voice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the  air a foot or so away from the edge of the roof.    \"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you'll certainly be  killed.\"    \"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked around  in a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can't lose even one  of them by falling in this country, because I really couldn't manage to  fall if I wanted to.\"    \"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl.    \"Of course; can't you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the air  and back to the edge of the roof.    \"It's wonderful!\" said Dorothy.    \"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help  us,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these  strange happenings.    \"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl.    Zeb drew back with a shiver.    \"I wouldn't dare try,\" he said.    \"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse.    \"And may be he won't!\" answered Jim. \"I've tumbled through the air long  enough to make me contented on this roof.\"    \"But we didn't tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time we  reached here we were floating very slowly, and I'm almost sure we could  float down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the air  all right.\"    \"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in a  scornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton.\"    \"You don't weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,  shaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You're dreadfully  skinny.\"    \"Oh, well; I'm old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"and  I've had lots of trouble in my day, little one. For a good many years I  drew a public cab in Chicago, and that's enough to make anyone skinny.\"    \"He eats enough to get fat, I'm sure,\" said the boy, gravely.    \"Do I? Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?\" growled Jim,  as if he resented Zeb's speech.    \"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of danger  like this it's foolish to talk about eating.\"    \"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,  with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present no  one can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. If  there are, they are liable to be glass oats!\"    [Illustration: \"COME ON, JIM! IT'S ALL RIGHT.\"]    \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I can see plenty of nice gardens and  fields down below us, at the edge of this city. But I wish we could find  a way to get to the ground.\"    \"Why don't you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I'm as hungry as the horse is,  and I want my milk.\"    \"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion.    Zeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadful  adventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. But he did not  wish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to the  edge of the roof.    Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it  rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. It seemed firm  enough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot.  Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both  walking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.    \"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It's all right.\"    Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensible  horse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go where  the others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short  tail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating  downward to the street. His great weight made him fall faster than the  children walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came to  the glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even  jarred.    \"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strange  country this is.\"    People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,  and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. There were men and women,  but no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed and  attractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was not  an ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleased  by the appearance of these people because their features had no more  expression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did they  frown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness.  They simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim and  Eureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the  children bore an outward resemblance to themselves.    Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the  dark"]]]
