The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout  the entry:         acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).         acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.         aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,  smoke, or fog.         afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by  planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on  areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire.         asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly  used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic  in particulate form.         biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.         bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.         biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given  area or volume.         carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon  (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.         catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.         DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.         defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.         deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.         desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.         dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.         drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is  generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often  results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-  commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the  ocean clean\".         ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.         effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial  waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting  it.         endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.         freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.         greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the  lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.         groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth  often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the  source for wells and natural springs.         Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27675"],[0,"The 1996 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1,";    Albanian majority in Kosovo seeks independence from Serbian    Republic; Albanians in Macedonia claim discrimination in education,    access to public-sector jobs and representation in government;    Albania is involved in negotiations with Greece over border    demarcation, the treatment of Albania's ethnic Greek minority, and    migrant Albanian workers in Greece    Climate: mild temperate; cool, cloudy, wet winters; hot, clear,    dry summers; interior is cooler and wetter    Terrain: mostly mountains and hills; small plains along coast    lowest point: Adriatic Sea 0 m    highest point: Maja e Korabit 2,753 m    Natural resources: petroleum, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper,    timber, nickel    Land use:    arable land: 21%    permanent crops: 4%    meadows and pastures: 15%    forest and woodland: 38%    other: 22%    Irrigated land: 4,230 sq km (1989)    Environment:    current issues: deforestation; soil erosion; water pollution from    industrial and domestic effluents    natural hazards: destructive earthquakes; tsunami occur along    southwestern coast    international agreements: party to - Biodiversity, Climate Change    Geographic note: strategic location along Strait of Otranto (links    Adriatic Sea to Ionian Sea and Mediterranean Sea)        People  ------      Population: 3,249,136 (July 1996 est.)    note: the IMF, working with Albanian government figures, estimates    that the population was 3,120,000 in 1993 and that it has fallen    since 1990    Age structure:    0-14 years: 34% (male 570,978; female 529,147)    15-64 years: 60% (male 910,873; female 1,049,662)    65 years and over: 6% (male 77,799; female 110,677) (July 1996 est.)

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe    depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally    planned system in 1990 and 1991. Stabilization policies - including    a strict monetary policy, public sector layoffs, and reduced social    services - have improved the government's fiscal situation and    reduced inflation. The recovery has been spurred by the remittances    of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly in Greece    and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the    large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid    also supported the recovery. Most agricultural land was privatized    in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. Albania's    industrial sector ended its five-year, 78% decline in 1995,    recording roughly 6% growth. A sharp fall in chromium prices has    reduced hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large    segments of the population, especially those living in urban areas,    continue to depend on humanitarian aid to meet basic food    requirements. Unemployment remains a severe problem accounting for    approximately one-fifth of the work force. Now that sanctions on    Serbia have been suspended, the falloff in hard currency earnings    from smuggling will aggravate unemployment problems. Growth is    expected to continue in 1996, but could falter if workers'    remittances from Greece are reduced or foreign assistance declines.
