Why therefore do  they leave at home [desert] their own parish [their called  ministers, their parishes], the Word of God, wives, children,  etc., who are ordained and [attention to whom is necessary and  has been] commanded, and run after these unnecessary,  uncertain, pernicious will-o'-the-wisps of the devil [and  errors]? Unless the devil was riding [made insane] the Pope,  causing him to praise and establish these practices, whereby  the people again and again revolted from Christ to their own  works, and became idolaters, which is worst of all; moreover,  it is neither necessary nor commanded, but is senseless and  doubtful, and besides harmful. Hence here, too, there can be  no yielding or surrendering [to yield or concede anything here  is not lawful], etc. And let this be preached, that such  pilgrimages are not necessary, but dangerous; and then see  what will become of them. [For thus they will perish of their  own accord.]    Fourthly. Fraternities [or societies], in which cloisters,  chapters, vicars have assigned and communicated (by a legal  contract and sale) all masses and good works, etc., both for  the living and the dead. This is not only altogether a human  bauble, without the Word of God, entirely unnecessary and not  commanded, but also contrary to the chief article, Of  Redemption. Therefore it is in no way to be tolerated.    Fifthly. The relics, in which there are found so many  falsehoods and tomfooleries concerning the bones of dogs and  horses, that even the devil has laughed at such rascalities,  ought long ago to have been condemned, even though there were  some good in them; and so much the more because they are  without the Word of God; being neither commanded nor  counseled, they are an entirely unnecessary and useless thing.  But the worst is that [they have imagined that] these relics  had to work indulgence and the forgiveness of sins [and have  revered them] as a good work and service of God, like the  Mass, etc.    Sixthly. Here belong the precious indulgences granted (but  only for money) both to the living and the dead, by which the  miserable [sacrilegious and accursed] Judas, or Pope, has sold  the merit of Christ, together with the superfluous merits of  all saints and of the entire Church, etc. All these things  [and every single one of them] are not to be borne, and are  not only without the Word of God, without necessity, not  commanded, but are against the chief article. For the merit of  Christ is [apprehended and] obtained not by our works or  pence, but from grace through faith, without money and merit;  and is offered [and presented] not through the power of the  Pope, but through the preaching of God's Word.      Of the Invocation of Saints.    The invocation of saints is also one of the abuses of  Antichrist conflicting with the chief article, and destroys  the knowledge of Christ. Neither is it commanded nor  counseled, nor has it any example [or testimony] in Scripture,  and even though it were a precious thing, as it is not [while,  on the contrary, it is a most harmful thing], in Christ we  have everything a thousandfold better [and surer, so that we  are not in need of calling upon the saints].    And although the angels in heaven pray for us (as Christ  Himself also does), as also do the saints on earth, and  perhaps also in heaven, yet it does not follow thence that we  should invoke and adore the angels and saints, and fast, hold  festivals, celebrate Mass in their honor, make offerings, and  establish churches, altars, divine worship, and in still other  ways serve them, and regard them as helpers in need [as  patrons and intercessors], and divide among them all kinds of  help, and ascribe to each one a particular form of assistance,  as the Papists teach and do. For this is idolatry, and such  honor belongs alone to God. For as a Christian and saint upon  earth you can pray for me, not only in one, but in many  necessities. But for this reason I am not obliged to adore and  invoke you, and celebrate festivals, fast, make oblations,  hold masses for your honor [and worship], and put my faith in  you for my salvation. I can in other ways indeed honor, love,  and thank you in Christ. If now such idolatrous honor were  withdrawn from angels and departed saints, the remaining honor  would be without harm and would quickly be forgotten. For when  advantage and assistance, both bodily and spiritual, are no  more to be expected, the saints will not be troubled [the  worship of the saints will soon vanish], neither in their  graves nor in heaven. For without a reward or out of pure love  no one will much remember, or esteem, or honor them [bestow on  them divine honor].    In short, the Mass itself and anything that proceeds from it,  and anything that is attached to it, we cannot tolerate, but  must condemn, in order that we may retain the holy Sacrament  pure and certain, according to the institution of Christ,  employed and received through faith.          Article III: Of Chapters and Cloisters.    That chapters and cloisters [colleges of canons and  communistic dwellings], which were formerly founded with the  good intention [of our forefathers] to educate learned men and  chaste [and modest] women, ought again to be turned to such  use, in order that pastors, preachers, and other ministers of  the churches may be had, and likewise other necessary persons  [fitted] for [the political administration of] the secular  government [or for the commonwealth] in cities and countries,  and well-educated, maidens for mothers and housekeepers, etc.    If they will not serve this purpose, it is better that they be  abandoned or razed, rather than [continued and], with their  blasphemous services invented by men, regarded as something  better than the ordinary Christian life and the offices and  callings ordained by God. For all this also is contrary to the  first chief article concerning the redemption made through  Jesus Christ. Add to this that (like all other human  inventions) these have neither been commanded; they are  needless and useless, and, besides, afford occasion for  dangerous and vain labor [dangerous annoyances and fruitless  worship], such services as the prophets call Aven, i.e., pain  and labor.          Article IV: Of the Papacy.    That the Pope is not, according to divine law or according to  the Word of God the head of all Christendom (for this [name]  belongs to One only, whose name is Jesus Christ), but is only  the bishop and pastor of the Church at Rome, and of those who  voluntarily or through a human creature (that is, a political  magistrate) have attached themselves to him, to be Christians,  not under him as a lord, but with him as brethren [colleagues]  and comrades, as the ancient councils and the age of St.  Cyprian show.    But to-day none of the bishops dare to address the Pope as  brother as was done at that time [in the age of Cyprian]; but  they must call him most gracious lord, even though they be  kings or emperors. This [Such arrogance] we will not, cannot,  must not take upon our conscience [with a good conscience  approve]. Let him, however, who will do it, do so without us  [at his own risk].    Hence it follows that all things which the Pope, from a power  so false, mischievous, blasphemous, and arrogant, has done and  undertaken, have been and still are purely diabolical affairs  and transactions (with the exception of such things as pertain  to the secular government, where God often permits much good  to be effected for a people, even through a tyrant and  [faithless] scoundrel) for the ruin of the entire holy  [catholic or] Christian Church (so far as it is in his power)  and for the destruction of the first and chief article  concerning the redemption made through Jesus Christ.    For all his bulls and books are extant, in which he roars like  a lion (as the angel in Rev. 12 depicts him), [crying out] that  no Christian can be saved unless he obeys him and is subject  to him in all things that he wishes, that he says, and that he  does. All of which amounts to nothing less than saying:  Although you believe in Christ, and have in Him [alone]  everything that is necessary to salvation, yet it is nothing  and all in vain unless you regard [have and worship] me as  your god, and be subject and obedient to me. And yet it is  manifest that the holy Church has been without the Pope for at  least more than five hundred years, and that even to the  present day the churches of the Greeks and of many other  languages neither have been nor are yet under the Pope.  Besides, as often remarked, it is a human figment which is not  commanded, and is unnecessary and useless; for the holy  Christian [or catholic] Church can exist very well without  such a head, and it would certainly have remained better  [purer, and its career would have been more prosperous] if  such a head had not been raised up by the devil. And the  Papacy is also of no use in the Church, because it exercises  no Christian office; and therefore it is necessary for the  Church to continue and to exist without the Pope.    And supposing that the Pope would yield this point, so as not  to be supreme by divine right or from Gods command, but that  we must have [there must be elected] a [certain] head, to whom  all the rest adhere [as their support] in order that the  [concord and] unity of Christians may be preserved against  sects and heretics, and that such a head were chosen by men,  and that it were placed within the choice and power of men to  change or remove this head, just as the Council of Constance  adopted nearly this course with reference to the Popes,  deposing three and electing a fourth; supposing, I say, that  the Pope and See at Rome would yield and accept this (which,  nevertheless, is impossible; for thus he would have to suffer  his entire realm and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27341"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 4, June 1906 (#3)"],[1," safest characterization of him. The accounts of expenditures speak  louder of a man's true nature than his diary.\" How well these words  apply to the richest of the rich and to their methods of disposing of  their capital!    Take philanthropy, for instance, with its loud and common display. How  it humiliates those that receive, and how it overestimates the  importance of those that give.    Philanthropy that steals in large quantities and returns of its bounty  in medicine drops, that snatches the last bite from the mouth of the  people and graciously gives them a few crumbs or a gnawed bone!    Again, philanthropy as a money mania--in one instance it feeds the  clergy on fat salaries, so that they might proclaim the virtue of  self-denial, sobriety and prudence; in another instance it builds Sunday  schools for young numbskulls and political aspirants who pretend to  listen to the commonplace discourse about our Father in Heaven who gives  every true Christian an opportunity to make money; rather would these  milk-sops appreciate the advice of the young nabob as to how to turn a  hundred-dollar bill into a thousand.    Philanthropy, establishing scientific societies for the investigation of  the mode of life of fleas, or philanthropy excremating libraries,  maintaining missionaries in China or fostering the research of breeding  sea horses.    Mrs. Vanderbilt has the heels of her shoes set in diamonds, while  another great philanthropist has established a pension for aged parrots.  Indeed, the stupidity and sad lack of imagination of our philanthropists  are pitiful. However, when one realizes that they are responsible for  the distress, the poverty, and despair of the great masses of humanity,  pity turns into anger and disgust with a society that will endure it  all.    [Illustration]    The Chicago papers report a blood-curdling story, which has affected the  Philistines like red affects a turkey. Knowing the keen sense of humor  of our readers, we herewith reprint the story:    \"Treason and blasphemy as an outburst of Anarchism all but broke up a  meeting held last night in the Masonic Temple under the auspices of the  Spencer-Whitman Center, at which the subject of \"Crime in Chicago\" was  discussed by various speakers. The Rev. John Roach Straton, pastor of  the Second Baptist Church, was in the midst of the discourse detailing  his theories with reference to the subject in hand when a voice from the  doorway shouted out a blasphemous expression.    The cry was greeted by hisses, but it was only a moment later that the  same voice called:    \"Down with America! Up with Anarchy!\"    There was a rush for the door. A tall young man was the first to reach  the offender, who is said to have been Carl Havel, associate editor of a  German newspaper. There was a blow and the blasphemer reeled and fell  against the wall. At the same moment a man, said to be Terence Carlin, a  member of a prominent Chicago family, struck Havel's assailant. He in  turn was seized by Parker H. Sercombe, chairman of the meeting, and a  man who gave the name of Ben Bansig.    The party struggled back and forth in the doorway, and the disturbers  were forced back to an ante-room. Blows were struck in a lusty fashion  and cries of \"Police!\" \"They're murdering them!\" \"Help!\" rang out.    Finally the two disturbers made as if to get out, and the arrival of a  watchman in uniform quieted them and their pursuers. It was, however,  with ill grace that the disturbers of the meeting were allowed to leave,  and as they passed through a door, cursing the law, the country, and  God, a girl, still in her teens, broke through the crowd and turning to  Havel, said:    \"That's all right, father.\"    Ben Bansig saved Chicago,--there can be no dispute about that. As to  Sercombe, the editor of _To-Morrow_, he deserves recognition. I suggest  that he be awarded a tooth brush at the expense of City Hall.    Our three friends, Terence Carlin, Havel, Mary Latter--who, as I can  authentically prove, is not the daughter of Hyppolite Havel--can console  themselves with the fact that their protest has done the names of  Whitman and Spencer more honor than the gas of the Baptist preacher.    [Illustration]    That the suspiciously-red noses of the newspaper men should have smelt  the \"immoral conduct\" of Maxim Gorky, was really very fortunate for the  latter. He is now relieved from the impertinence of interviewers and  prominent personages. He must feel as if he had recovered from some  loathsome disease. Immorality has after all many desirable qualities.  What if chickens gaggle, pharisaic goats piously turn up their eyes, and  the dear little piggies grunt!    [Illustration]    Well-meaning people are horrified that justice is making use of such  creatures as Orchard and McParland against Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone.  There is nothing unusual in that. The record of the American government  in its persecution against Socialists and Anarchists is by no means so  clean that one need be astonished that it employs spies and perjurers as  its helpmates.

Dear Editor:--I hope you have not been trying to relieve your feelings  by using language dangerous to your soul's salvation. I can sympathize  with you, though. However, it was impossible for me to send the promised  article for \"M. E.\" Who, indeed, could expect a bride of two weeks to  waste time upon magazine articles?! I hope you have read the reports of  my marriage, though your silence would indicate that you have either  neglected to read the important news, or that your usual lack of faith  in the truth and honesty of the press has not permitted you to credit  the story.    It is high time, dear friend, that you get rid of your German  skepticism; you know, I esteem your judgment, but when it comes to  doubting anything the newspapers say, I draw the line. What reporters do  not know about Anarchists, and especially about your publisher, is not  worth knowing. According to their great wisdom I not only incited men to  remove the crowned heads of various countries, but I have done worse--I  have incited them to marry me, and when they proved unwilling to love,  honor and obey the order of our secret societies to blow up all sacred  institutions, I sent them about their business.    Much as I realize the importance of my articles for MOTHER EARTH, you  cannot expect me to sacrifice my wifely duty to my lord and master for  Earth's sake.    I have always held to the opinion that there must be absolute confidence  between publisher and editor on all matters except the receipts;  therefore I have to confess that my newly-wedded husband, who has just  graduated from the University of the Western Penitentiary--the  curriculum of which is lots of liberty, leisure and enjoyment--objects  to the drudgery of an agitator and publisher. In justice to him, I dare  not do more than write letters all day, address meetings every evening,  and enjoy the love and kindness of the comrades till early morning  hours. Where, then, shall I find time to write articles for MOTHER  EARTH?    But to be in keeping with the serious and dignified tone of our valuable  magazine, and especially with you dear Editor, I want to say that my  meetings were very successful, and that MOTHER EARTH is being received  with great favor in every city. Nearly 500 copies were sold here.    After reading the brilliant reports in the Chicago papers and seeing the  handsome, refined policemen at the various meetings, I am not surprised  that our magazine is being appreciated. Apropos of the Chicago police,  just fancy, I have actually forced them out of their uniforms. I hope  this will not conjure up the horrible picture of Chicago's finest  parading the city in Adam's costume. Not that! Only, Chief of Police  Collins was so outraged over my gentle criticism of his dear little boys  at one of the woodworkers' meetings, that he gave strict orders, \"No  officer should again appear at a public meeting in uniform where that  awful Emma Goldman is humiliating and degrading the emblem of authority  and law.\"    After this, I hope you will never again doubt the importance of public  meetings and the great and far-reaching influence of my speaking.    I shall soon be with you, if I survive my tour, the police, and the  press. I shall then try to make up for my sins, in the July number of  MOTHER EARTH, provided you will let me recuperate in your editorial care  and affection.    EMMA GOLDMAN.    [Illustration]          LIBERTARIAN INSTRUCTION.    By EMILE JANVION.      AMONG the important duties of Anarchists libertarian instruction should  occupy the first place. As revolutionary propaganda it is the most  effective. Tolstoi in Yasnaia-Poliana, Reclus at Bruxelles, Paul Robin  at Cempius, the group of the Free School at Paris have inaugurated  attempts during the period of daring we have witnessed of late years.    Far from mixing education with instruction, the former should be  considered as the natural consequence of the latter.    Our ideas should never be imposed by an education too specialized,  narrow or sectarian, but by means of full and all-round instruction  which opens the mind to criticism and makes it accessible to the power  of truth which is our strength and which will complete the forming of  the character.    Our instruction should be _integral_, _rational_, and _mixed_.    _Integral_--Because it will tend to develop the whole being and make a  complete, free _ensemble_, equally progressive in all knowledge,  intellectual, physical, manual and professional, and this from the  earliest age.    _Rational_--Because it will be based on reason and in conformity with  actual science and not on faith; on the development of personal Freedom  and"]]]
