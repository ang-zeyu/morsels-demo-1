Soon after it  returned, leading by the ear another rat, which it left at a small  distance from the hole which they entered. A third rat joined this kind  conductor; they then foraged about, and picked up all the small scraps of  biscuit; these they carried to the second rat, which seemed blind, and  remained in the spot where they had left it, nibbling such fare as its  dutiful providers, whom the narrator supposes were its offspring, brought  to it from the more remote parts of the floor.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XV.    The Dinner Bell.      It is customary in large boarding-houses to announce the dinner-hour by  the sound of a bell. A cat belonging to one of these houses always  hastened to the hall on hearing the bell, to get its accustomed meal; but  it happened one day that she was shut up in a chamber, and it was in vain  for her that the bell had sounded. Some hours after, having been released  from her confinement, she hastened to the hall, but found nothing left for  her. The cat thus disappointed got to the bell, and sounding it,  endeavoured to summon the family to a second dinner, in which she doubted  not to participate.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XVI.    A Singular Interposition.      A lady had a tame bird which she was in the habit of letting out of its  cage every day. One morning as it was picking crumbs of bread off the  carpet, her cat, who always before showed great kindness for the bird,  seized it on a sudden, and jumped with it in her mouth upon a table. The  lady was much alarmed for the fate of her favourite, but on turning about  instantly discerned the cause. The door had been left open, and a strange  cat had just come into the room! After turning it out, her own cat came  down from her place of safety, and dropped the bird without having done it  the smallest injury.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XVII.    Odd Fraternity.      A gentleman travelling through Mecklenburg was witness to the following  curious circumstance in an inn at which he was staying. After dinner, the  landlord placed on the floor a large dish of soup, and gave a loud  whistle. Immediately there came into the room a mastiff, a fine Angora  cat, an old raven, and a remarkably large rat with a bell about its neck.  These four animals went to the dish, and without disturbing each other,  fed together; after which the dog, cat, and rat lay before the fire, while  the raven hopped about the room.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XVIII.    Canine Smugglers.      In the Netherlands, they use dogs of a very large and strong breed, for  the purpose of draught. They are harnessed like horses, and chiefly  employed in drawing little carts with fish, vegetables, &c., to market.  Previous to the year 1795, such dogs were also employed in smuggling;  which was the more easy, as they are exceedingly docile. The dogs were  trained to go backwards and forwards between two places on the frontiers,  without any person to attend them. Being loaded with little parcels of  goods, lace, &c., like mules, they set out at midnight, and only went when  it was perfectly dark. An excellent quick-scented dog always went some  paces before the others, stretched out his nose towards all quarters, and  when he scented custom-house officers, turned back, which was the signal  for immediate flight. Concealed behind bushes, or in ditches, the dogs  waited till all was safe, then proceeded on their journey, and reached at  last beyond the frontier the dwelling-house of the receiver of the goods,  who was in the secret. But here, also, the leading dog only at first  showed himself; on a certain whistle, which was a signal that all was  right, they all hastened up. They were then unloaded, taken to a  convenient stable, where there was a good layer of hay, and well fed.  There they rested until midnight, and then returned in the same manner  back, over the frontiers.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XIX.    A Canine Sheep-Stealer.      A shepherd, who was hanged for sheep-stealing, used to commit his  depredations by means of his dog. When he intended to steal any sheep, he  detached the dog to perform the business. With this view, under pretence  of looking at the sheep, with an intention to purchase them, he went  through the flock with the dog at his foot, to whom he secretly gave a  signal, so as to let him know the particular sheep he wanted, perhaps to  the number of ten or twelve, out of a flock of some hundreds; he then went  away, and from a distance of several miles, sent back the dog by himself  in the night time, who picked out the individual sheep that had been  pointed out to him, separated them from the flock, and drove them before  him, frequently a distance of ten or twelve miles, till he came up with  his master, to whom he delivered up his charge.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XX.    The Dog and Goose.      A goose was once observed to attach itself in the strongest and most  affectionate manner to the house dog, but never presumed to go into the  kennel except in rainy weather; whenever the dog barked, the goose would  cackle, and run at the person she supposed the dog barked at, and try to  bite him by the heels. Sometimes she would attempt to feed with the dog;  but this the dog, who treated his faithful companion with indifference,  would not suffer. This bird would not go to roost with the others at  night, unless driven by main force; and when in the morning they were  turned into the field, she would never stir from the yard gate, but sit  there the whole day in sight of the dog. At length orders were given that  she should no longer be molested; being thus left to herself, she ran  about the yard with him all night, and what is particularly remarkable,  whenever the dog went out of the yard and ran into the village, the goose  always accompanied him, contriving to keep up with him by the assistance  of her wings, and in this way of running and flying, followed him all over  the parish. This extraordinary affection of the goose towards the dog,  which continued till his death, two years after it was first observed, is  supposed to have originated in his having saved her from a fox, in the  very moment of distress.    While the dog was ill, the goose never quitted him, day or night, not even  to feed; and it was apprehended that she would have been starved to death  had not a pan of corn been set every day close to the kennel. At this time  the goose generally sat in the kennel, and would not suffer any one to  approach it, except the person who brought the dog's, or her own food. The  end of this faithful bird was melancholy; for when the dog died, she would  still keep possession of the kennel, and a new house dog being introduced,  which in size and colour resembled that lately lost, the poor goose was  unhappily deceived, and going into the kennel as usual, the new inhabitant  seized her by the throat and killed her.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXI.    Sabinus and his Dog.      After the execution of Sabinus, the Roman general, who suffered death for  his attachment to the family of Germanicus, his body was exposed to the  public upon the precipice of the Gemoniae, as a warning to all who should  dare to befriend the house of Germanicus: no friend had courage to  approach the body; one only remained true--his faithful dog. For three  days the animal continued to watch the body; his pathetic howlings  awakened the sympathy of every heart. Food was brought him, which he was  kindly encouraged to eat; but on taking the bread, instead of obeying the  impulse of hunger, he fondly laid it on his master's mouth, and renewed  his lamentations; days thus passed, nor did he for a moment quit the body.    The body was at length thrown into the Tiber, and the generous creature,  still unwilling that it should perish, leaped into the water after it, and  clasping the corpse between its paws, vainly endeavoured to preserve it  from sinking.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXII.    Wrens Learning to Sing.      A wren built her nest in a box, so situated that a family had an  opportunity of observing the mother bird instructing the young ones in the  art of singing peculiar to the species. She fixed herself on one side of  the opening in the box, directly before her young, and began by singing  over her whole song very distinctly. One of the young then attempted to  imitate her. After proceeding through a few notes, its voice broke, and it  lost the tune. The mother immediately recommenced where the young one had  failed, and went very distinctly through the remainder. The young bird  made a second attempt, commencing where it had ceased before, and  continuing the song as long as it was able; and when the note was again  lost, the mother began anew where it stopped, and completed it. Then the  young one resumed the tune and finished it. This done, the mother sang  over the whole series of notes a second time with great precision; and a  second of the young attempted to follow her. The wren pursued the same  course with this as with the first; and so with the third and fourth. It  sometimes happened that the young one would lose the tune three, four, or  more times in the same attempt; in which case the mother uniformly began  where they ceased, and sung the remaining notes; and when each had  completed the trial, she repeated the whole strain. Sometimes two of the  young commenced together. The mother observed the same conduct towards  them as when one sang alone. This was repeated day after day, and several  times in a day.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXIII.    The Dog of Montargis.      A Frenchman of family and fortune, travelling alone through a forest, was  murdered and buried under a tree. His dog, an English bloodhound, would  not quit his master's grave, till at length, compelled by hunger, he  proceeded to the house of a friend of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2434"],[0,"New Atlantis (#3)"],[1,"ad,) sat down with  him, And when we were set, he began thus: \"We of this island of  Bensalem,\" (for so they call it in their language,) \"have this; that by  means of our solitary situation; and of the laws of secrecy, which we  have for our travellers, and our rare admission of strangers; we know  well most part of the habitable world, and are ourselves unknown.  Therefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions, it  is more reason, for the entertainment of the time, that ye ask me  questions, than that I ask you.\"    We answered; \"That we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave so  to do: and that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there  was no worldly thing on earth, more worthy to be known than the state  of that happy land.  But above all,\" (we said,) \"since that we were met  from the several ends of the world, and hoped assuredly that we should  meet one day in the kingdom of Heaven, (for that we were both parts  Christians,) we desired to know, (in respect that land was so remote,  and so divided by vast and unknown seas, from the land where our  Saviour walked on earth,) who was the apostle of that nation, and how  it was converted to the faith?\"  It appeared in his face that he took  great contentment in this our question: he said; \"Ye knit my heart to  you, by asking this question in the first place; for it sheweth that  you first seek the kingdom of heaven; and I shall gladly, and briefly,  satisfy your demand.    \"About twenty years after the ascension of our Saviour, it came to  pass, that there was seen by the people of Renfusa, (a city upon the  eastern coast of our island,) within night, (the night was cloudy, and  calm,) as it might be some mile into the sea, a great pillar of light;  not sharp, but in form of a column, or cylinder, rising from the sea a  great way up towards heaven; and on the top of it was seen a large  cross of light, more bright and resplendent than the body of the  pillar.  Upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city  gathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put  themselves into a number of small boats, to go nearer to this  marvellous sight.  But when the boats were come within (about) sixty  yards of the pillar, they found themselves all bound, and could go no  further; yet so as they might move to go about, but might not approach  nearer: so as the boats stood all as in a theatre, beholding this light  as an heavenly sign.  It so fell out, that there was in one of the  boats one of the wise men, of the society of Salomon's House; which  house, or college (my good brethren) is the very eye of this kingdom;  who having awhile attentively and devoutly viewed and contemplated this  pillar and cross, fell down upon his face; and then raised himself upon  his knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, made his prayers in this  manner.    \"'LORD God of heaven and earth, thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to  those of our order, to know thy works of Creation, and the secrets of  them: and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men)  between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures  and illusions of all sorts.  I do here acknowledge and testify before  this people, that the thing which we now see before our eyes is thy  Finger and a true Miracle.  And forasmuch as we learn in our books that  thou never workest miracles, but to divine and excellent end, (for the  laws of nature are thine own laws, and thou exceedest them not but upon  great cause,) we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign,  and to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy; which thou  dost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us.'    \"When he had made his prayer, he presently found the boat he was in,  moveable and unbound; whereas all the rest remained still fast; and  taking that for an assurance of leave to approach, he caused the boat  to be softly and with silence rowed towards the pillar.  But ere he  came near it, the pillar and cross of light brake up, and cast itself  abroad, as it were, into a firmament of many stars; which also vanished  soon after, and there was nothing left to be seen, but a small ark, or  chest of cedar, dry, and not wet at all with water, though it swam.  And in the fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small green  branch of palm; and when the wise man had taken it, with all reverence,  into his boat, it opened of itself, and there were found in it a Book  and a Letter; both written in fine parchment, and wrapped in sindons of  linen.  The Book contained all the canonical books of the Old and New  Testament, according as you have them; (for we know well what the  churches with you receive); and the Apocalypse itself, and some other  books of the New Testament, which were not at that time written, were  nevertheless in the Book.  And for the Letter, it was in these words:    \"'I, Bartholomew, a servant of the Highest, and Apostle of Jesus  Christ, was warned by an angel that appeareth to me, in a vision of  glory, that I should commit this ark to the floods of the sea.  Therefore I do testify and declare unto that people where God shall  ordain this ark to come to land, that in the same day is come unto them  salvation and peace and good-will, from the Father, and from the Lord  Jesus.'    \"There was also in both these writings, as well the Book, as the  Letter, wrought a great miracle, conform to that of the Apostles, in  the original Gift of Tongues.  For there being at that time in this  land Hebrews, Persians, and Indians, besides the natives, every one  read upon the Book, and Letter, as if they had been written in his own  language.  And thus was this land saved from infidelity (as the  remainder of the old world was from water) by an ark, through the  apostolical and miraculous evangelism of Saint Bartholomew.\"  And here  he paused, and a messenger came, and called him from us.  So this was  all that passed in that conference.    The next day, the same governor came again to us, immediately after  dinner, and excused himself, saying; \"That the day before he was called  from us, somewhat abruptly, but now he would make us amends, and spend  time with us if we held his company and conference agreeable.\" We  answered, \"That we held it so agreeable and pleasing to us, as we  forgot both dangers past and fears to come, for the time we hear him  speak; and that we thought an hour spent with him, was worth years of  our former life.\"  He bowed himself a little to us, and after we were  set again, he said; \"Well, the questions are on your part.\"    One of our number said, after a little pause; that there was a matter,  we were no less desirous to know, than fearful to ask, lest we might  presume too far.  But encouraged by his rare humanity towards us, (that  could scarce think ourselves strangers, being his vowed and professed  servants,) we would take the hardiness to propound it: humbly  beseeching him, if he thought it not fit to be answered, that he would  pardon it, though he rejected it.  We said; \"We well observed those his  words, which he formerly spake, that this happy island, where we now  stood, was known to few, and yet knew most of the nations of the world;  which we found to be true, considering they had the languages of  Europe, and knew much of our state and business; and yet we in Europe,  (notwithstanding all the remote discoveries and navigations of this  last age), never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island.  This we found wonderful strange; for that all nations have  inter-knowledge one of another, either by voyage into foreign parts, or  by strangers that come to them: and though the traveller into a foreign  country, doth commonly know more by the eye, than he that stayeth at  home can by relation of the traveller; yet both ways suffice to make a  mutual knowledge, in some degree, on both parts.  But for this island,  we never heard tell of any ship of theirs that had been seen to arrive  upon any shore of Europe; nor of either the East or West Indies; nor  yet of any ship of any other part of the world, that had made return  from them.  And yet the marvel rested not in this.  For the situation  of it (as his lordship said) in the secret conclave' of such a vast sea  might cause it.  But then, that they should have knowledge of the  languages, books, affairs, of those that lie such a distance from them,  it was a thing we could not tell what to make of; for that it seemed to  us a conditioner and propriety of divine powers and beings, to be  hidden and unseen to others, and yet to have others open and as in a  light to them.\"    At this speech the Governor gave a gracious smile, and said; \"That we  did well to ask pardon for this question we now asked: for that it  imported, as if we thought this land, a land of magicians, that sent  forth spirits of the air into all parts, to bring them news and  intelligence of other countries.\"  It was answered by us all, in all  possible humbleness, but yet with a countenance taking knowledge, that  we knew that he spake it but merrily, \"That we were apt enough to think  there was somewhat supernatural in this island; but yet rather as  angelical than magical.  But to let his lordship know truly what it was  that made us tender and doubtful to ask this question, it was not any  such conceit, but because we remembered, he had given a touch in his  former speech, that this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers.\"  To this he said; \"You remember it aright and therefore in that I shall  say to you, I must reserve some particulars, which it is not lawful for  me to reveal; but there will be enough left, to give you satisfaction.\"    \"You shall understand (that which perhaps you will scarce think  credible) that about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, the  navigation of the world, (especially for remote voyages,) was greater  than at this"]]]
