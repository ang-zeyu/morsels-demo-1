The girl's fancy's caught and she'll go her own gait to  ruin. Ruin, I tell ye. If she marries that handsome ne'er-do-well,  she'll be a wretched woman all her days and none to pity her.\"    The two moved away then, and Paul lay motionless, face downward on the  sand, his lips pressed against Joan's sweet, crushed rose. He felt no  anger over Byron Lyall's unsparing condemnation. He knew it was true,  every word of it. He _was_ a worthless scamp and always would be. He  knew that perfectly well. It was in his blood. None of his race had  ever been respectable and he was worse than them all. He had no  intention of trying to reform because he could not and because he did  not even want to. He was not fit to touch Joan's hand. Yet he had  meant to marry her!    But to spoil her life! Would it do that? Yes, it surely would. And if  he were out of the way, taking his baleful charm out of her life,  Connor Mitchell might and doubtless would win her yet and give her all  he could not.    The man suddenly felt his eyes wet with tears. He had never shed a  tear in his daredevil life before, but they came hot and stinging now.  Something he had never known or thought of before entered into his  passion and purified it. He loved Joan. Did he love her well enough to  stand aside and let another take the sweetness and grace that was now  his own? Did he love her well enough to save her from the  poverty-stricken, shamed life she must lead with him? Did he love her  better than himself?    \"I ain't fit to think of her,\" he groaned. \"I never did a decent thing  in my life, as they say. But how can I give her up--God, how can I?\"    He lay still a long time after that, until the moonlight crept around  the boat and drove away the shadow. Then he got up and went slowly  down to the water's edge with Joan's rose, all wet with his  unaccustomed tears, in his hands. Slowly and reverently he plucked off  the petals and scattered them on the ripples, where they drifted  lightly off like fairy shallops on moonshine. When the last one had  fluttered from his fingers, he went back to the house and hunted up  Captain Alec Matheson, who was smoking his pipe in a corner of the  verandah and watching the young folks dancing through the open door.  The two men talked together for some time.    When the dance broke up and the guests straggled homeward, Paul sought  Joan. Rob Shelley had his own girl to see home and relinquished the  guardianship of his sister with a scowl. Paul strode out of the  kitchen and down the steps at the side of Joan, smiling with his usual  daredeviltry. He whistled noisily all the way up the lane.    \"Great little dance,\" he said. \"My last in Prospect for a spell, I  guess.\"    \"Why?\" asked Joan wonderingly.    \"Oh, I'm going to take a run down to South America in Matheson's  schooner. Lord knows when I'll come back. This old place has got too  deadly dull to suit me. I'm going to look for something livelier.\"    Joan's lips turned ashen under the fringes of her white fascinator.  She trembled violently and put one of her small brown hands up to her  throat. \"You--you are not coming back?\" she said faintly.    \"Not likely. I'm pretty well tired of Prospect and I haven't got  anything to hold me here. Things'll be livelier down south.\"    Joan said nothing more. They walked along the spruce-fringed roads  where the moonbeams laughed down through the thick, softly swaying  boughs. Paul whistled one rollicking tune after another. The girl bit  her lips and clenched her hands. He cared nothing for her--he had been  making a mock of her as of others. Hurt pride and wounded love fought  each other in her soul. Pride conquered. She would not let him, or  anyone, see that she cared. She would _not_ care!    At her gate Paul held out his hand.    \"Well, good-bye, Joan. I'm sailing tomorrow so I won't see you  again--not for years likely. You will be some sober old married woman  when I come back to Prospect, if I ever do.\"    \"Good-bye,\" said Joan steadily. She gave him her cold hand and looked  calmly into his face without quailing. She had loved him with all her  heart, but now a fatal scorn of him was already mingling with her  love. He was what they said he was, a scamp without principle or  honour.    Paul whistled himself out of the Shelley lane and over the hill. Then  he flung himself down under the spruces, crushed his face into the  spicy frosted ferns, and had his black hour alone.    But when Captain Alec's schooner sailed out of the harbour the next  day, Paul King was on board of her, the wildest and most hilarious of  a wild and hilarious crew. Prospect people nodded their satisfaction.    \"Good riddance,\" they said. \"Paul King is black to the core. He never  did a decent thing in his life.\"          A Soul That Was Not at Home      There was a very fine sunset on the night Paul and Miss Trevor first  met, and she had lingered on the headland beyond Noel's Cove to  delight in it. The west was splendid in daffodil and rose; away to the  north there was a mackerel sky of little fiery golden clouds; and  across the water straight from Miss Trevor's feet ran a sparkling path  of light to the sun, whose rim had just touched the throbbing edge of  the purple sea. Off to the left were softly swelling violet hills and  beyond the sandshore, where little waves were crisping and silvering,  there was a harbour where scores of slender masts were nodding against  the gracious horizon.    Miss Trevor sighed with sheer happiness in all the wonderful,  fleeting, elusive loveliness of sky and sea. Then she turned to look  back at Noel's Cove, dim and shadowy in the gloom of the tall  headlands, and she saw Paul.    It did not occur to her that he could be a shore boy--she knew the  shore type too well. She thought his coming mysterious, for she was  sure he had not come along the sand, and the tide was too high for him  to have come past the other headland. Yet there he was, sitting on a  red sandstone boulder, with his bare, bronzed, shapely little legs  crossed in front of him and his hands clasped around his knee. He was  not looking at Miss Trevor but at the sunset--or, rather, it seemed as  if he were looking through the sunset to still grander and more  radiant splendours beyond, of which the things seen were only the pale  reflections, not worthy of attention from those who had the gift of  further sight.    Miss Trevor looked him over carefully with eyes that had seen a good  many people in many parts of the world for more years than she found  it altogether pleasant to acknowledge, and she concluded that he was  quite the handsomest lad she had ever seen. He had a lithe, supple  body, with sloping shoulders and a brown, satin throat. His hair was  thick and wavy, of a fine reddish chestnut; his brows were very  straight and much darker than his hair; and his eyes were large and  grey and meditative. The modelling of chin and jaw was perfect and his  mouth was delicious, being full without pouting, the crimson lips just  softly touching, and curving into finely finished little corners that  narrowly escaped being dimpled.    His attire was a blue cotton shirt and a pair of scanty corduroy  knickerbockers, but he wore it with such an unconscious air of purple  and fine linen that Miss Trevor was tricked into believing him much  better dressed than he really was.    Presently he smiled dreamily, and the smile completed her subjugation.  It was not merely an affair of lip and eye, as are most smiles; it  seemed an illumination of his whole body, as if some lamp had  suddenly burst into flame inside of him, irradiating him from his  chestnut crown to the tips of his unspoiled toes. Best of all, it was  involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but simply the  outflashing of some wild, delicious thought that was as untrammelled  and freakish as the wind of the sea.    Miss Trevor made up her mind that she must find out all about him, and  she stepped out from the shadows of the rocks into the vivid, eerie  light that was glowing all along the shore. The boy turned his head  and looked at her, first with surprise, then with inquiry, then with  admiration. Miss Trevor, in a white dress with a lace scarf on her  dark, stately head, was well worth admiring. She smiled at him and  Paul smiled back. It was not quite up to his first smile, having more  of the effect of being put on from the outside, but at least it  conveyed the subtly flattering impression that it had been put on  solely for her, and they were as good friends from that moment as if  they had known each other for a hundred years. Miss Trevor had enough  discrimination to realize this and know that she need not waste time  in becoming acquainted.    \"I want to know your name and where you live and what you were looking  at beyond the sunset,\" she said.    \"My name is Paul Hubert. I live over there. And I can't tell just what  I saw in the sunset, but when I go home I'm going to write it all in  my foolscap book.\"    In her surprise over the second clause of his answer, Miss Trevor  forgot, at first, to appreciate the last. \"Over there,\" according to  his gesture, was up at the head of Noel's Cove, where there was a  little grey house perched on the rocks and looking like a large  seashell cast up by the tide. The house had a stovepipe coming out of  its roof in lieu of a chimney, and two of its window panes were  replaced by shingles. Could this boy, who looked as young princes  should--and seldom do--live there? Then he was a shore boy after all.    \"Who lives there with you?\" she asked. \"You see\"--plaintively--\"I must  ask questions about you. I know we like each other, and that is all  that really matters. But there are some tiresome items which it would  be convenient to know. For example, have you a father--a mother? Are  there any more of you? How long have you been yourself?\"    Paul did not reply"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24884"],[0,"Commercial Geography (#3)"],[1,"feudal estate, therefore, became a sort of industrial centre by  itself, producing its own food-stuffs and much of the coarser  manufactures. It was not a very high condition of enlightenment, but it  was much better than the one which preceded it, for at least it offered  protection. It encouraged a certain amount of trade and commerce,  because the feudal lord had many wants, and he was usually willing to  protect the merchant who supplied them.    =The Crusades and Commerce.=--The Crusades, or wars by which the  Christians sought to recover the Holy Land from the Turk, resulted in a  trade between Europe and India that grew to wonderful proportions. Silk  fabrics, cotton cloth, precious stones, ostrich plumes, ivory, spices,  and drugs--all of which were practically unknown in Europe--were eagerly  sought by the nobility and their dependencies. In return, linen and  woollen fabrics, leather goods, glassware, blacklead, and steel  implements were carried to the far East.    Milan, Florence, Venice and Genoa, Constantinople and a number of less  important towns along the Mediterranean basin became important trade  centres, but Venice and Genoa grew to be world powers in commerce. Not  only were they great receiving and distributing depots of trade, but  they were great manufacturing centres as well.    The routes over which this enormous commerce was carried were few in  number. For the greater part, the Venetian trade went to Alexandria, and  thence by the Red Sea to India. Genoese merchants sent their goods to  Constantinople and Trebizond, thence down the Tigris River to the  Persian Gulf and to India. There was also another route that had been  used by the Phoenicians. It extended from Tyre through Damascus and  Palmyra[2] to the head of the Persian Gulf; this gradually fell into  disuse after the founding of Alexandria.    The general effects of this trade were very far-reaching. To the greater  number of the people of Europe, the countries of India, China, and Japan  were mythical. According to tradition they were infested with dragons  and gryphons, and peopled by dog-headed folk or by one-eyed Arimaspians.  About the first real information of them to be spread over Europe was  brought by Marco Polo, whose father and uncle had travelled all through  these countries during the latter part of the thirteenth century.[3]  Marco Polo's writings were very widely read, and influenced a great many  people who could not be reached through the ordinary channels of  commerce. So between the wars of the Crusades on the one hand, and the  growth of commerce on the other, a new and a better civilization began  to spread over Europe.    =The Turkish Invasions.=--But the magnificent trade that had thus grown up  was checked for a time by an unforeseen factor. The half-savage  Turkomans living southeast of Russia had become converted to the  religion of Islam, and in their zeal for the new belief, determined to  destroy the commerce which seemed to be connected with Christianity. So  they moved in upon the borderland between Europe and Asia, and one after  another the trade routes were tightly closed. Then they captured  Constantinople, and the routes between Genoa and the Orient were  hermetically sealed. Moslem power also spread over Syria and Egypt, and  so, little by little, the trade of Venice was throttled.    [Illustration: ROUTES TO INDIA--THE TURK CHANGES THE COMMERCE OF THE  WORLD]    Now a commerce that involved not only many millions of dollars, but the  employment of thousands of people as well, is not likely to be given up  without a struggle. So the energy that had been devoted to this great  trade was turned in a new direction, and there began a search for a new  route to India--one that the Turks could not blockade.    =The Search for an All-Water Route to India.=--Overland routes were out of  the question; there were none that could be made available, and so the  search was made for a sea-route. Rather singularly the Venetians and  Genoese, who had hitherto controlled this trade, took no part in the  search; it was conducted by the Spanish and the Portuguese.    The Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile, fitted out an  expedition under Christopher Columbus, a master-mariner and  cartographer, the funds being provided by Isabella, who pledged her  private property as security for the cost of the expedition. This  expedition resulted in the discovery, October 10-21, 1492, of the West  India Islands. In a subsequent voyage, Columbus discovered the mainland  of South America.    Even before the voyage of Columbus, the Portuguese had been trying to  find a way around Africa to India, and Pope Eugenius IV. had conferred  on Portugal \"all heathen lands from Cape Bojador eastward even to the  Indies.\" Little by little, therefore, Portuguese navigators were pushing  southward until, in 1487, Bartholomew Dias sighted the Cape of Good  Hope, and got about as far as Algoa Bay. Then he unwillingly turned back  because of the threats of his crew. It was a most remarkable voyage, and  one of the shipmates of Dias was Bartholomew Columbus, a brother of the  discoverer of the New World.    Ten years later, or five years after the voyage of Columbus, Vasco da  Gama sailed from Lisbon for the Cape of Good Hope. As he passed the Cape  he was terribly storm-tossed, but the storms carried him in a fortunate  direction. And when at last he got his reckonings, he was off the coast  of India; he therefore kept along the coast until in sight of a port.  The port was the well-known city of Calicut. Two years later he returned  to Europe by the same route, his ships laden with spices, precious  stones, beautiful tapestries and brocades, ivory and bronzes. The  long-sought sea-route to India had been discovered.    [Illustration: A HANSE CITY--HAMBURG, ALONG THE WATER-FRONT]    =Commerce in Western Europe.=--After the discovery of the new route,  Venice and Genoa were scarcely heard of in relation to commerce; they  lost everything and gained nothing. The great commerce with the Orient  was to have a new western terminus, and the latter was to be on the  shores of the North and Baltic Seas.    The commerce between Europe and India stimulated trade in western Europe  as well. As early as the twelfth century the manufacture of linen and  woollen cloth had grown to be a very important industry that had  resulted in the rapid growth of population. The older cities grew  rapidly, and new ones sprang up wherever the commodities of trade were  gathered, manufactured, or distributed.    These centres of trade had two hostile elements against them. The feudal  lords used to pillage them legally by extorting heavy taxes and forced  loans whenever their treasuries were empty. The portionless brothers and  relatives of the feudal lords, to whom no employments save war,  adventure, and piracy were open, pillaged them illegally. Along the  coasts especially, piracy was considered not only a legitimate, but a  genteel, profession. So in order to protect themselves, the cities began  to join themselves into leagues.    =The Hanse League.=--About the beginning of the thirteenth century[4]  Hamburg and Luebeck formed an alliance afterward called a _hansa_; at the  beginning of the fourteenth century it embraced seventy cities, having  the capital at Luebeck. At the time of its greatest power the League  embraced all the principal cities of western Europe nearly as far south  as the Danube. Large agencies, called \"factories,\" were established in  London, Bruges, Novgorod, Bergen, and Wisby. The influence of the League  practically controlled western Europe.    The Hanse League performed a wonderful work. It stopped piracy on the  seas and robbery on the land. Industrially, it encouraged  self-government and obedience to constitutional authority. Shipbuilding  and navigation so greatly improved that the ocean traffic resulting from  the discovery of the cape route to India quickly fell into the hands of  Hanse sailors and master-mariners. The League not only encouraged and  protected all sorts of manufactures, but its schools trained thousands  of operatives. The mines were worked and the idle land cultivated. It  was the greatest industrial movement that ever occurred.    [Illustration: HANSE ROUTES--THE HANSE LEAGUE REORGANIZES THE TRADE OF  THE WORLD]    Socially, the Hanse League brought the wealth that gave those comforts  and conveniences before unknown. The standards of social life,  education, art, and science were raised from a condition scarcely  better than barbarism to a high plane of civilization. Indeed, the  civilization of western Europe was the most important result of it.    It forced the rights of individual freedom, as well as municipal  independence, from more than one monarch, and punished severely the  kings who sought to betray it. It crushed the power of those who opposed  it,[5] and rewarded those who were faithful to it. Its most important  mission, however, was the overthrow of feudalism and the gradual  substitution of popular government in its place.    Having accomplished the regeneration of Europe, the Hanse League died  partly by its own hand, because of its arrogance, but mainly from the  fact that, having educated western Europe to self-government and  commercial independence, there was no longer need for its existence.  Independent cities grew rapidly into importance, and these got along  very well without the protection of the League. The great industrial  progress was at times temporarily checked by wars, but it never took a  backward step. Indeed the progress of commerce has always been a contest  between brains and brute force, and in such a struggle there is never  any doubt about the final outcome.
