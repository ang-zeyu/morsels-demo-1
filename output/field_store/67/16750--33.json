In the corresponding slokas of Manu, ten Palas are said to be  equivalent to one Dharana.

Let the monarch,[43] free from anger or thought of gain, in  conjunction with learned brahmans, adjudicate law-suits, according  to the Dharma Sastras.    2. He shall appoint judges perfect in the Vedas and in science,[44]  versed in the Dharma Sastras, such as speak truth and bear  themselves alike to friend and foe.    3. If the monarch, from press of other business, cannot adjudicate, he  shall appoint a brahman versed in the whole law, [to preside] with  the judges.[45]    4. Should the judges, from partiality, from love of gain, or from  fear, act in anywise contrary to law or usage;[46] each one [so  acting] shall be amerced in double the value of the suit.    5. When one who is aggrieved by others, in any way contrary to law or  usage, makes a representation to the monarch; this is matter for a  law-suit.    6. The representation, as made by the plaintiff, is to be put in  writing, in presence of the defendant; the year, month, half-month,  day, names, cast, &c.,[47] being given.    7. The answer [of the defendant] to what he has heard [read] is then  to be put in writing, in presence of him who made the first  representation: and then the latter shall, at once, furnish a  statement in writing of the proof to support what he has asserted.    8. This being established, he succeeds in his suit; otherwise, the  reverse. Thus it appears, the procedure in law-suits has four steps.    9. Let not a counter-complaint be preferred until the [original]  complaint is disposed of, nor let a third person [sue] him against  whom a complaint is pending.[48] The statement of the cause of suit is  not to be varied.[49]    10. [The defendant] may bring a counter-plaint for abusive  language,[50] or personal trespass,[50] or for acts of atrocious  violence.[51] On behalf of each party, a surety, competent to meet the  result of the suit, shall be bound.    11. One against whom, after [a plea of] denial, judgment is given,  shall pay the amount [adjudged to the plaintiff] together with an  equal sum to the monarch.[52] One who has made a false complaint,  shall forfeit double the amount of his claim.    12. In a case of atrocious violence, of theft, of reviling or personal  trespass,[53] where a cow is the subject, or a [malicious] charge of  crime,[54] or an offence destructive of life or property[54] where a  female [of the household] is the subject--[in each of these cases] the  Court shall compel the parties to go to trial forthwith. In other  cases, a day may be appointed at pleasure.    13. One who moves from place to place,[55] who licks the corners of  his mouth, whose forehead sweats, and whose countenance changes  colour.    14. who with words from a dry throat, stammering, says much that is  contradictory, who makes no response to word or look, who contracts  the lips--    15. whosoever [in this wise] changes his natural manner, in the action  of his mind, of his speech, and of his person, is to be set down as  false in his complaint, or [if a witness] in his testimony.[56]    16. One who enforces by his own arbitrary act a claim which is denied,  who absconds, or who does not respond when called--[each of these] is  considered to have failed, and is amenable to punishment.[57]    17. Where there are [rival claims, and] witnesses on both sides, the  witnesses of him who asserts the elder title, are to be [first]  examined: if that title be admitted,[58] then the witnesses of him  who claims by subsequent title [shall be examined].[59]    18. Should the suit be accompanied by a wager, [the Court] shall  compel the losing party to pay the fine [prescribed],[60] as well as  his wager and his debt to the creditor.    19. Let the monarch, rejecting subtleties, conduct the trial of suits  upon the merits: even merits, in the absence of proof, must fail of  success in the suit.    20. If one plead a denial to a representation including several  matters,[61] and one part be proved against him, the monarch shall  compel him to pay the whole amount claimed: but what has not been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],[0,"Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#3)"],[1,"end, is a little tube  through which the food passes. It is in the head above this tube where  the tiny brain is, and from which two little threads run down around  the tube and join to form another little knot of nerve cells like that  of the brain. Then, from this second one there runs a series of little  knots united by fine threads the entire length of the body, one in each  ring of the body. Do you understand that?\"    \"Yes,\" piped up Betty, \"mother told us an insect is made up of rings,  and--and--\" she stammered, surprised at her own boldness, \"the word  means cut up into parts.\"    \"Good! Why, that's a real bright girl. Well, from each one of these  knots nerves go to the muscles of the body.\"    \"It's just like a lot of beads on a string,\" said Hope Stanton.    \"So it is, child. So, you see, if we handle an insect roughly, squeezing  it too hard, or breaking a leg or a wing, a message is sent to one of  these little beads or knots or nerve cells, and the poor, helpless  creature suffers pain.\"    \"But I didn't mean to hurt that butterfly!\"    \"No, of course you didn't. The only way to do,\" said the old man, \"is to  catch them in a net. Make it of bobinet with a rounded bottom, sewing it  to a wire ring and fastening it to a handle that is the right weight and  length for your arm.\"    \"But then, after you caught it, how could you keep it, sir?\" asked  Betty.    \"There are two merciful ways,\" said the old man, \"of killing insects,  but neither way is safe for children to try. Put a few drops of  chloroform on a piece of cotton under a tumbler turned upside down. Put  the insect inside. It will soon fall asleep without pain. The other is a  cyanide bottle. I have one down at the cabin. It must be kept tightly  corked and never smelled. The cyanide in the bottle is hard and dry.  Several insects may be put into the bottle at the same time. Once there  they die very quickly. After large insects are killed the wings should  be folded over the back, and they should be placed in a little case like  this. See, I'm folding a piece of paper to form a three-cornered case.  Then I bend down one edge to keep the little case closed.\"    At this moment out flew Lizzie with a curtain which she was going to  shake.    \"Here, here!\" shouted the old man, \"don't shake that; catch that  caterpillar on it. I want it.\"    Lizzie made a good-natured grab at the caterpillar, and then there was a  cry of pain. \"Oh, begorra, begorra, I'm stung by a wasp, I am! Ow!\" But  she still kept tight hold of the caterpillar as she danced about.    \"No,\" said the guide, \"you're not stung by any wasp. Bring me that!  There, open your hand. You see, the caterpillar stung you.\"    \"Oh my, what a beauty!\" exclaimed the children. \"But caterpillars don't  sting.\"    \"Oh yes, they do,\" continued Ben Gile, with a twinkle in his eye; \"ask  Lizzie.\" Lizzie was looking at the palm of her hand, which showed how  badly it had been stung.    \"Now, you see, we'll need something to pick up these little creatures  with--a pair of forceps or something of that kind. At least, you must be  very careful.\"    \"And what else do we need?\" asked the children.    \"A little hand lens will magnify the small parts of an insect a great  deal. It will show you all the tiny hairs on the body, and the little  rings and the feelers and the facets of the eyes, and many another  wonderful thing.\"    \"What are we going to put the bugs in?\" inquired Jimmie.    \"Lizzie will get you a small wooden box,\" said Mrs. Reece.    Lizzie went off grumbling something about guides and bites and insects,  but soon she came back with a nice box, and in a minute all the  children's heads were clustered about Ben Gile as he showed them how to  line the box with a layer of cork, how to steam the insects a little if  they were dry, and then how to put the long, slender pins through the  chest of the insect and stick it into the cork.          III    THE LITTLE ARMY      Ben Gile shook his head. As his hair was long and white, and his hands  moved with his head, just as if he were a lot of dried branches moving  in the wind, it was enough to frighten little Betty. \"Plagues of Egypt!  Plagues of Egypt!\" he kept muttering. Now, Betty had been to school a  long time--I think it must have been as much as two whole years, which  is a very _long_ time for school and a very _short_ time for climbing  trees--now, Betty had been to school and knew better. She crept behind a  big beech-tree, but she stuck her little head out and said, in a  trembling voice:    \"It was locusts, sir, wasn't it--and wild honey?\"    Betty wasn't at all certain that any kind of honey could be a plague.    \"It was locusts, child--yes, you're right,\" answered the old man.  \"Locusts it was; but you eat wild honey.\"    Betty came out from behind the tree and whispered, \"You eat them  _both_?\"    \"So men did in the Bible,\" said Ben Gile, and washing his sugar-pails,  and putting his maple sugar camp--a very sweet place for a little girl  to be when there are still piles of maple sugar packed away on the  shelves--in order for the summer.    In all her short life Betty had never known another old man like him. In  the winter he taught school; in spring he made maple sugar; in summer he  was guiding about the ponds or looking up into the trees most of the  time; and in the fall he cut wood before he went back to teaching; but  what was oddest of all to Betty was that he knew the squirrels and deer  and rabbits as well as he seemed to know little girls or little boys.  There was a story told in those woods about his taming even a trout so  that one morning it hopped out of the water and followed him everywhere  he went--hop, hop, flop behind him. And in the evening, as Ben Gile and  his tame trout were passing by the pond again, the trout fell in and was  drowned. But, dear me, that is a fish story, and you mustn't believe any  fish stories whatever except those your father tells! Still, if your  grandpa is fond of fishing, you may believe his fish stories, too.    [Illustration:  _A._ A locust.  _B._ Cast-off skin of a young locust.]    Betty came out farther from behind the tree. \"Please, sir, do _you_ eat  grasshoppers?\"    \"Not yet, my dear.\" The old man's eyes twinkled. \"I knew a little boy  once\"--Betty was wondering whether this old man had ever been a little  boy himself--\"I knew a little boy once who wasn't afraid to swallow even  a caterpillar, but I think that little boy never thought of eating a  grasshopper.\" The old man shook his head gravely. \"No, not a  grasshopper.\"    \"Please, sir,\" said Betty, coming right up to the bucket he was washing  in the brook--\"please, sir, do you know any stories about grasshoppers?\"    Ben Gile laid his finger along his nose and thought. Betty was sure he  knew a hundred million stories, and that he could tell her something  about anything she might ask for in all the world.    \"Well, once upon a time,\" the old man began, \"there was another old man  who was a great deal wiser than I am, and a great deal richer, my dear,  for he owned a whole kingdom and lived in a palace, and his name was--\"    \"Solomon!\" called out Betty, dancing up and down, out of pride in her  own wisdom.    \"Right! And this other old man said:         \"There are four things which are little upon the earth, but       they are exceedingly wise:         \"The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their       meat in the summer;         \"The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses       in the rocks;         \"The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by       bands;         \"The spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings'       palaces.\"    \"But that's not a story.\"    The guide shook his head. \"You don't know a story, child, when you hear  one. It began, 'Once upon a time,' didn't it?\"    \"Yes, sir; but please tell me another.\"    \"Well, there are others in the Bible, my dear, about locusts and  grasshoppers.\"    \"But, please, sir,\" said Betty, who was almost ready to cry, she was so  teased--\"please tell me one of your _own_ stories.\"    Ben Gile began to swash his bucket up and down, up and down, in the  stream until the water fairly rocked. Then he pulled the bucket out of  the water, set it beside him, and reached out after a locust.    \"Here he is.\" There was a long pause. Betty thought he would never go  on. \"Well, once upon a time there was a little army and all its uniforms  were brown and green, and from the meanest soldier in the ranks to the  lieutenant-commander this little army was made up of insects who  belonged to the same tribe. Let me see--there were the grasshoppers and  the locusts and the katydids and the crickets.\"    \"Please, sir, were they cousins?\"    \"I think they were, my dear. Yes, first cousins, and, unlike even my  first cousins, they all have wings, and straight wings like this.\"    The guide gently spread out one of the wings.    \"Just where the back of your chest is these wings grow--two pairs of  wings, my dear, and two pairs of wings mean a good deal more than two  pairs of new shoes. This first pair is straight and narrow and hard,  because it is meant to cover the gauzy wings underneath. Puff!\"    Away flew the locust.    \"You see, he doesn't use his first pair, but holds them out straight  from his body while he spreads out the gauzy ones like a--like a--\"    \"Fan!\" shouted Betty, quite forgetting the tiny squirrel who had come up  near her, and, at her shout, nearly jumped out of his little red  jacket.    \"A yellow fan,\" said the old man. \"And some have a red fan. Well, I  think,\" said he, reaching for his pail, \"there isn't going to be any  more of this story.\"    \"Not any more? But there must be more, sir; I've seen hundreds and  hundreds of them on a dusty road, and, please, they're just the color of  the dirt.\"    The guide shook his head. \"Not to-day.\"    By this time Betty was so eager to have him go on that she had"]]]
