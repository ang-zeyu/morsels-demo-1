This means go ten or  twenty feet from the door of his den, for all the grass is eaten off  near home.    [Illustration]    Among the herbage he sits up high to take a final look around, then  burying his nose in the fodder, he begins his meal. This is the chance  that the waiting, watching, she-Coyote counted on. There is a flash of  gray fur from behind that little grease bush; in three hops she is upon  him. He takes alarm at the first sound and tries to reach the haven  hole, but she snaps him up. With a shake she ends his troubles. He  hardly knows the pain of death, then she bounds away on her back track  to the home den on the distant hillside. She does not come near it  openly and rashly. There is always the possibility of such an approach  betraying the family to some strong enemy on watch. She circles around a  little, scrutinizes the landscape, studies the tracks and the wind, then  comes to the door by more or less devious hidden ways. The sound of a  foot outside is enough to make the little ones cower in absolute  silence, but mother reassures them with a whining call much like that of  a dog mother. They rush out, tumbling over each other in their glee, six  or seven in number usually, but sometimes as high as ten or twelve.  Eagerly they come, and that fat Prairie-dog lasts perhaps three minutes,  at the end of which time nothing is left but the larger bones with a  little Coyote busy polishing each of them. Strewn about the door of the  den are many other kindred souvenirs, the bones of Ground-squirrels,  Chipmunks, Rabbits, Grouse, Sheep, and Fawns, with many kinds of  feathers, fur, and hair, to show the great diversity of Coyote diet.    [Illustration]      THE COYOTE'S SENSE OF HUMOUR    To understand the Coyote fully one must remember that he is simply a  wild dog, getting his living by his wits, and saving his life by the  tireless serviceability of his legs; so has developed both these gifts  to an admirable pitch of perfection. He is blessed further with a gift  of music and a sense of humour.    When I lived at Yancey's, on the Yellowstone, in 1897, I had a good  example of the latter, and had it daily for a time. The dog attached to  the camp on the inner circle was a conceited, irrepressible little puppy  named Chink. He was so full of energy, enthusiasm, and courage that  there was no room left in him for dog-sense. But it came after a vast  number of humiliating experiences.    [Illustration]    A Coyote also had attached himself to the camp, but on the outer circle.  At first he came out by night to feed on the garbage pile, but realizing  the peace of the Park he became bolder and called occasionally by day.  Later he was there every day, and was often seen sitting on a ridge a  couple of hundred yards away.    [Illustration: II. Chink's adventures with the Coyote and the Picket-pin  _Sketches by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: IV. (a) The Whistler watching me from the rocks.  _Photo by E. T. Seton_  (b) A young Whistler  _Photo by G. G. Seton_]    One day he was sitting much nearer and grinning in Coyote fashion, when  one of the campers in a spirit of mischief said to the dog, \"Chink, you  see that Coyote out there grinning at you. Go and chase him out of  that.\"    Burning to distinguish himself, that pup set off at full speed, and  every time he struck the ground he let off a war-whoop. Away went the  Coyote and it looked like a good race to us, and to the Picket-pin  Ground-squirrels that sat up high on their mounds to rejoice in the  spectacle of these, their enemies, warring against each other.    The Coyote has a way of slouching along, his tail dangling and tangling  with his legs, and his legs loose-jointed, mixing with his tail. He  doesn't seem to work hard but oh! how he does cover the prairie! And  very soon it was clear that in spite of his magnificent bounds and  whoops of glory, Chink was losing ground. A little later the Coyote  obviously had to slack up to keep from running away altogether. It had  seemed a good race for a quarter of a mile, but it was nothing to the  race which began when the Coyote turned on Chink. Uttering a gurgling  growl, a bark, and a couple of screeches, he closed in with all the  combined fury of conscious might and right, pitted against unfair  unprovoked attack.    And Chink had a rude awakening; his war-whoops gave place to yelps of  dire distress, as he wheeled and made for home. But the Coyote could run  all around him, and nipped him, here and there, and when he would, and  seemed to be cracking a series of good jokes at Chink's expense, nor  ever stopped till the ambitious one of boundless indiscretion was hidden  under his master's bed.    This seemed very funny at the time, and I am afraid Chink did not get  the sympathy he was entitled to, for after all he was merely carrying  out orders. But he made up his mind that from that time on, orders or no  orders, he would let Coyotes very much alone. They were not so easy as  they looked.    [Illustration]    The Coyote, however, had discovered a new amusement. From that day he  simply \"laid\" for that little dog, and if he found him a hundred yards  or so from camp, would chase and race him back in terror to some  shelter. At last things got so bad that if we went for a ride even, and  Chink followed us, the Coyote would come along, too, and continue his  usual amusement.    At first it was funny, and then it became tedious, and at last it was  deeply resented by Chink's master. A man feels for his dog; he wasn't  going to stand still and see his dog abused. He began to grumble vaguely  about \"If something didn't happen pretty soon, something else would.\"  Just what he meant I didn't ask, but I know that the Coyote disappeared  one day, and never was seen or heard of again. I'm not supposed to know  any thing about it, but I have my suspicions, although in those days the  Coyote was a protected animal.      HIS DISTINGUISHING GIFT    The scientific name of the Coyote (_Canis latrans_), literally \"Barking  Dog,\" is given for the wonderful yapping chorus with which they seldom  fail to announce their presence in the evening, as they gather at a safe  distance from the campfire. Those not accustomed to the sound are very  ready to think that they are surrounded by a great pack of ravening  Wolves, and get a sufficiently satisfactory thrill of mingled emotions  at the sound. But the guide will reassure you by saying that that great  pack of howling Wolves is nothing more than a harmless little Coyote,  perhaps two, singing their customary vesper song, demonstrating their  wonderful vocal powers. Their usual music begins with a few growling,  gurgling yaps which are rapidly increased in volume and heightened in  pitch, until they rise into a long squall or scream, which again, as it  dies away, breaks up into a succession of yaps and gurgles. Usually one  Coyote begins it, and the others join in with something like agreement  on the scream.    I believe I never yet camped in the West without hearing this from the  near hills when night time had come. Last September I even heard it back  of the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, and I must say I have learned to love  it. It is a wild, thrilling, beautiful song. Our first camp was at  Yancey's last summer and just after we had all turned in, the Coyote  chorus began, a couple of hundred yards from the camp. My wife sat up  and exclaimed, \"Isn't it glorious? now I know we are truly back in the  West.\"    The Park authorities are making great efforts to reduce the number of  Coyotes because of their destructiveness to the young game, but an  animal that is endowed with extraordinary wits, phenomenal speed,  unexcelled hardihood, and marvellous fecundity, is not easily downed. I  must confess that if by any means they should succeed in exterminating  the Coyote in the West, I should feel that I had lost something of very  great value. I never fail to get that joyful thrill when the \"Medicine  Dogs\" sing their \"Medicine Song\" in the dusk, or the equally weird and  thrilling chorus with which they greet the dawn; for they have a large  repertoire and a remarkable register. The Coyote is indeed the Patti of  the Plains.      THE COYOTE'S SONG[A]        I am the Coyote that sings each night at dark;        It was by gobbling prairie-dogs that I got such a bark.      At least a thousand prairie-dogs I fattened on, you see,        And every bark they had in them is reproduced in me.        _Refrain_:        I can sing to thrill your soul or pierce it like a lance,      And all I ask of you to do is give me half a chance.      With a yap--yap--yap for the morning      And a yoop--yoop--yoop for the night      And a yow--wow--wow for the rising moon      And a yah-h-h-h for the campfire light.          Yap--yoop--yow--yahhh!        I gathered from the howling winds, the frogs and crickets too,        And so from each availing fount, my inspiration drew.      I warbled till the little birds would quit their native bush.        And squat around me on the ground in reverential hush.        _Refrain_:        I'm a baritone, soprano, and a bass and tenor, too.        I can thrill and slur and frill and whirr and shake you through          and through.      I'm a Jews' harp--I'm an organ--I'm a fiddle and a flute.        Every kind of touching sound is found in the coyoot.        _Refrain_:        I'm a whooping howling wilderness, a sort of Malibran.        With Lind, Labache and Melba mixed and all combined in one.      I'm a grand cathedral organ and a calliope sharp,        I'm a gushing, trembling nightingale, a vast AEolian harp.        _Refrain_:        I can raise the dead or paint the town, or pierce you like a lance        And all I ask of you to do is to give me half a chance.

Two rabbis, Chiya bar Abba, a Halachist, and  Abbahu, a Haggadist, happened to be lecturing in the same town. Abbahu,  the Haggadist, was always listened to by great crowds, while Chiya, with  his Halacha, stood practically deserted. The Haggadist comforted the  disappointed teacher with a parable. \"Let us suppose two merchants,\" he  said, \"to come to town, and offer wares for sale. The one has pearls and  precious gems to display, the other, cheap finery, gilt chains, rings,  and gaudy ribbons. About whose booth, think you, does the crowd  press?--Formerly, when the struggle for existence was not fierce and  inevitable, men had leisure and desire for the profound teachings of the  Law; now they need the cheering words of consolation and hope.\"    For more than a thousand years this nameless spirit of national poesy  was abroad, and produced manifold works, which, in the course of time,  were gathered together into comprehensive collections, variously named  Midrash Rabba, Pesikta, Tanchuma, etc. Their compilation was begun in  about 700 C. E., that is, soon after the close of the Talmud, in the  transition period from the third epoch of Jewish literature to the  fourth, the golden age, which lasted from the ninth to the fifteenth  century, and, according to the law of human products, shows a season of  growth, blossom, and decay.    The scene of action during this period was western Asia, northern  Africa, sometimes Italy and France, but chiefly Spain, where Arabic  culture, destined to influence Jewish thought to an incalculable degree,  was at that time at its zenith. \"A second time the Jews were drawn into  the vortex of a foreign civilization, and two hundred years after  Mohammed, Jews in Kairwan and Bagdad were speaking the same language,  Arabic. A language once again became the mediatrix between Jewish and  general literature, and the best minds of the two races, by means of the  language, reciprocally influenced each other. Jews, as they once had  written Greek for their brethren, now wrote Arabic; and, as in  Hellenistic times, the civilization of the dominant race, both in its  original features and in its adaptations from foreign sources, was  reflected in that of the Jews.\" It would be interesting to analyze this  important process of assimilation, but we can concern ourselves only  with the works of the Jewish intellect. Again we meet, at the threshold  of the period, a characteristic figure, the thinker Sa'adia, ranking  high as author and religious philosopher, known also as a grammarian and  a poet. He is followed by Sherira, to whom we owe the beginnings of a  history of Talmudic literature, and his son Hai Gaon, a strictly  orthodox teacher of the Law. In their wake come troops of physicians,  theologians, lexicographers, Talmudists, and grammarians. Great is the  circle of our national literature: it embraces theology, philosophy,  exegesis, grammar, poetry, and jurisprudence, yea, even astronomy and  chronology, mathematics and medicine. But these widely varying subjects  constitute only one class, inasmuch as they all are infused with the  spirit of Judaism, and subordinate themselves to its demands. A mention  of the prominent actors would turn this whole essay into a dry list of  names. Therefore it is better for us merely to sketch the period in  outline, dwelling only on its greatest poets and philosophers, the  moulders of its character.    The opinion is current that the Semitic race lacks the philosophic  faculty. Yet it cannot be denied that Jews were the first to carry Greek  philosophy to Europe, teaching and developing it there before its  dissemination by celebrated Arabs. In their zeal to harmonize philosophy  with their religion, and in the lesser endeavor to defend traditional  Judaism against the polemic attacks of a new sect, the Karaites, they  invested the Aristotelian system with peculiar features, making it, as  it were, their national philosophy. At all events, it must be  universally accepted that the Jews share with the Arabs the merit \"of  having cherished the study of philosophy during centuries of barbarism,  and of having for a long time exerted a civilizing influence upon  Europe.\"    The meagre achievements of the Jews in the departments of history and  history of literature do not justify the conclusion that they are  wanting in historic perception. The lack of writings on these subjects  is traceable to the sufferings and persecutions that have marked their  pathway. Before their chroniclers had time to record past afflictions,  new sorrows and troubles broke in upon them. In the middle ages, the  history of Jewish literature is the entire history of the Jewish people,  its course outlined by blood and watered by rivers of tears, at whose  source the genius of Jewish poetry sits lamenting. \"The Orient dwells an  exile in the Occident,\" Franz Delitzsch, the first alien to give loving  study to this literature, poetically says, \"and its tears of longing for  home are the fountain-head of Jewish poetry.\"[6]    That poetry reached its perfection in the works of the celebrated trio,  Solomon Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, and Moses ben Ezra. Their dazzling  triumphs had been heralded by the more modest achievements of Abitur,  writing Hebrew, and Adia and the poetess Xemona (Kasmune) using Arabic,  to sing the praise of God and lament the woes of Israel.    The predominant, but not exclusive, characteristic of Jewish poetry is  its religious strain. Great thinkers, men equipped with philosophic  training, and at the same time endowed with poetic gifts, have  contributed to the huge volume of synagogue poetry, whose subjects are  praise of the Lord and regret for Zion. The sorrow for our lost  fatherland has never taken on more glowing colors, never been expressed  in fuller tones than in this poetry. As ancient Hebrew poetry flowed in  the two streams of prophecy and psalmody, so the Jewish poetry of the  middle ages was divided into _Piut_ and _Selicha_. Songs of hope and  despair, cries of revenge, exhortations to peace among men, elegies on  every single persecution, and laments for Zion, follow each other in  kaleidoscopic succession. Unfortunately, there never was lack of  historic matter for this poetry to elaborate. To furnish that was the  well-accomplished task of rulers and priests in the middle ages, alike  \"in the realm of the Islamic king of kings and in that of the apostolic  servant of servants.\" So fate made this poetry classical and eminently  national. Those characteristics which, in general literature, earn for a  work the description \"Homeric,\" in Jewish literature make a liturgical  poem \"Kaliric,\" so called from the poet Eliezer Kalir, the subject of  many mythical tales, and the first of a long line of poets, Spanish,  French, and German, extending to the sixteenth or seventeenth century.  The literary history of this epoch has been written by Leopold Zunz with  warmth of feeling and stupendous learning. He closes his work with the  hope that mankind, at some future day, will adopt Israel's religious  poetry as its own, transforming the elegiac _Selicha_ into a joyous  psalm of universal peace and good-will.    Side by side with religious flourishes secular poetry, clothing itself  in rhyme and metre, adopting every current form of poesy, and treating  of every appropriate subject. Its first votary was Solomon Gabirol, that        \"Human nightingale that warbled      Forth her songs of tender love,      In the darkness of the sombre,      Gothic mediaeval night.        She, that nightingale, sang only,      Sobbing forth her adoration,      To her Lord, her God, in heaven,      Whom her songs of praise extolled.\"[7]    Solomon Gabirol may be said to have been the first poet thrilled by  _Weltschmerz_. \"He produced hymns and songs, penitential prayers,  psalms, and threnodies, filled with hope and longing for a blessed  future. They are marked throughout by austere earnestness, brushing  away, in its rigor, the color and bloom of life; but side by side with  it, surging forth from the deepest recesses of a human soul, is humble  adoration of God.\"    Gabirol was a distinguished philosopher besides. In 1150, his chief  work, \"The Fount of Life,\" was translated into Latin by Archdeacon  Dominicus Gundisalvi, with the help of Johannes Avendeath, an apostate  Jew, the author's name being corrupted into Avencebrol, later becoming  Avicebron. The work was made a text-book of scholastic philosophy, but  neither Scotists nor Thomists, neither adherents nor detractors,  suspected that a heretical Jew was slumbering under the name Avicebron.  It remained for an inquirer of our own day, Solomon Munk, to reveal the  face of Gabirol under the mask of a garbled name. Amazed, we behold that  the pessimistic philosopher of to-day can as little as the schoolmen of  the middle ages shake himself free from the despised Jew. Schopenhauer  may object as he will, it is certain that Gabirol was his predecessor by  more than eight hundred years!    Charisi, whom we shall presently meet, has expressed the verdict on his  poetry which still holds good: \"Solomon Gabirol pleases to call himself  the small--yet before him all the great must dwindle and"]]]
