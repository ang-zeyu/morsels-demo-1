Built up of #Micrometer Slide#  M301 and #Microscope# M101, #with support# M310 #Fitted with Stage#. The  stage is 150 mm. long and provided with clips for holding objects, such as  spectrum photographs, scales, etc., and is fitted with illuminating mirror.  Price                                                              #$45.00#    #A1201. Small Comparator.# The instrument is intended for measuring spectra  photographs, gratings, divided scales, or such objects which can be focused  by the microscope and will allow rapid measurements of the highest possible  accuracy. The measurement depends on the accuracy of the micrometer screw,  which is cut and corrected with great care. The screw has a pitch of .5 mm.  and diameter of 15 mm. The index head attached to the screw is of  considerable diameter so as to allow the direct reading of .001 mm. The  head is divided on solid silver in 500 parts, and carries two rows of  figures indicating the first and second half of the mm. The full mm. are  read by means of a scale in front of the instrument. The bed plate is  heavy, of cast iron, and the guides are carefully scraped true within 0.001  mm. The carriage has a movement of 80 mm., is made of gun metal and fitted  exactly to the guides; it is also provided with a second or top carriage  with 40 mm. motion. The top carriage can be moved by hand and accurately  set by means of a micrometer screw. The microscope is of variable  magnifying power, focused by rack and pinion. Illumination for transparent  objects is given from below by means of a plane mirror. The instrument is  mounted on heavy supports, under an angle to make it convenient for the  observer. The instrument is finished in first-class manner, and the iron  bed plate heavily copper and nickel plated.    The design of this machine was suggested by Prof. Edwin Frost of the Yerkes  Observatory, where a number of these machines have been in constant use  during the last five years. Careful tests have shown the screw accurate  within .0003 of a mm. throughout the full length. Price           #$175.00#    #Note.#--The micrometer on microscope as shown in cut is not furnished with  instrument.    A tangent screw for revolving the eye piece with the spider thread can be  attached at a cost of $5.00.    [Illustration: A 1201]    [Illustration: A 1202]    #A1202. Comparator for Measuring Spectra Photographs, Scales, Etc.# Range  50 cm. The microscope travels on carefully straightened ways, and is moved  by a screw of 1 mm. pitch. The screw head is faced with a silver band and  is divided in 1000 parts. The handle for turning the screw is placed on the  left side of the instrument so as to have the right hand free for recording  readings.    A set of change gears can easily be engaged to give a fast motion to the  carriage. The stage will hold plates from 3 to 8 cm. in width and of 60 cm.  in length. It can be shifted lengthwise for a distance of 25 cm. and is  provided with adjustment for aligning the plates. The whole stage can be  easily removed from the instrument.    The microscope is fitted with variable magnifying power and is of standard  size. Price                                                       #$450.00#    #Note.#--The design of this comparator was suggested by Prof. Humphries,  Director Laboratory of the U. S. Weather Bureau, for whom the first one was  built.    [Illustration: A 1203]    #A1203. Comparator for Star Photographs#, measures in one direction 80 mm.  and under right angle 60 mm. The lower part is constructed similar to our  Comparator A1201. The top slide carries a divided circle for measuring  position angles. The circle is arranged similar to a position micrometer.  It is fitted with quick gear motion and tangent screw and the two verniers  read to 1-100 degree. The microscope has variable magnifying power and is  provided with reversing eye piece. This machine has been furnished for and  is in use at Yerkes, Lick and Kirkwood Observatories. Price       #$365.00#    [Illustration: A 1204]    #A1204. Comparator.# For Plates 8x10 inches. This machine was constructed  in accordance with suggestions given by Dr. Frank Schlesinger, Director of  Allegheny Observatory. The ways are carefully straightened to within 0.002  millimeter. The carriage is moved by two racks and pinions and has a large  handle on each side. Two concentric circles are fitted to the carriage, the  inner circle carries the plate with the film in a fixed plane, no matter  what the thickness of the glass may be. Both circles are provided with  clamps and tangent screws, so that each one may be clamped and adjusted  independently. The outside circle carries four index points 90 degrees  apart. One of these marks is made adjustable. These four marks serve to  turn the plate exactly 90 degrees so as to measure rectangular  coordinates. The guide carrying the measuring microscope is adjusted  exactly at right angles to the ways of the bed plate. The carriage  supporting the microscope is moved by rack and pinion. The microscope is  arranged to tilt, so as to view either the plate or the scale above. The  eye piece is provided with a reversing prism. Measurements are made on the  scale divided in millimeters. The smaller measurements, to 1-4000 of a mm.,  are made by the micrometer. The micrometer is fitted with sliding eye piece  and counter for full revolutions. The scale is not marked in the usual way  with single lines, but each millimeter is marked with a double line. This  double line allows the use of one single spider thread, which is preferable  to use for bisecting the star, and the double line on the scale allows a  clear setting with the single spider thread. The stage is fitted with an  adaptor for holding plates 4x5 inches. Price                      #$450.00#    This machine has been in use during the last years at the Yerkes  Observatory and has been found very convenient and satisfactory in every  way.    A graduated circle can be provided if desirable. Such division on solid  silver, with verniers reading to 1-100 of a degree will increase the cost  $50.00.    #A1205. Comparator#, for plates 4x5 in. of the same design as A1204.  Price                                                             #$300.00#    [Illustration: A 1206]    #A1206. Comparator.# A larger machine of the same design as A1204 with  scale of 45 cm. length, divided in double lines to 0.25 mm., and with two  carriages, one for spectrum plates of 18 in. length and the other with  divided circles for star photographs 12\"x14\". This instrument was  constructed for the Solar Observatory of the Carnegie Institution at Mount  Wilson, California.    [Illustration: COELOSTAT.

If I had a fire, I would not give you so much trouble,  but I do not care to light one at this hour. You know I am always afraid  of accidents, and they so easily happen!\"    \"Very well, then,\" replied Madame Legrand; \"go back to your room, and my  servant will bring it to you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Derues, bowing,--\"many thanks.\"    As he turned to depart, Madame Legrand spoke again.    \"This day week, Derues, you have to pay me half the twelve hundred  livres due for the purchase of my business.\"    \"So soon as that?\"    \"Certainly, and I want the money. Have you forgotten the date, then?\"    \"Oh dear, I have never looked at the agreement since it was drawn up. I  did not think the time was so near, it is the fault of my bad memory;  but I will contrive to pay you, although trade is very bad, and in three  days I shall have to pay more than fifteen thousand livres to different  people.\"    He bowed again and departed, apparently exhausted by the effort of  sustaining so long a conversation.    As soon as they were alone, the abbe exclaimed--    \"That man is assuredly an utter rascal! May God forgive him his  hypocrisy! How is it possible we could allow him to deceive us for so  long?\"    \"But, my father,\" interposed one of the visitors, \"are you really sure  of what you have just said?\"    \"I am not now speaking of the seventy-nine Louis d'or which have been  stolen from me, although I never mentioned to anyone but you, and he was  then present, that I possessed such a sum, and although that very day he  made a false excuse for coming to my rooms when I was out. Theft is  indeed infamous, but slander is not less so, and he has slandered you  disgracefully. Yes, he has spread a report that you, Madame Legrand,  you, his former mistress and benefactress, have put temptation in his  way, and desired to commit carnal sin with him. This is now whispered  the neighbourhood all round us, it will soon be said aloud, and we have  been so completely his dupes, we have helped him so much to acquire a  reputation for uprightness, that it would now be impossible to destroy  our own work; if I were to accuse him of theft, and you charged him with  lying, probably neither of us would be believed. Beware, these odious  tales have not been spread without a reason. Now that your eyes are  open, beware of him.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Madame Legrand, \"my brother-in-law warned me three years  ago. One day Derues said to my sister-in-law,--I remember the words  perfectly,--'I should like to be a druggist, because one would always be  able to punish an enemy; and if one has a quarrel with anyone it would  be easy to get rid of him by means of a poisoned draught.' I neglected  these warnings. I surmounted the feeling of repugnance I first felt at  the sight of him; I have responded to his advances, and I greatly fear I  may have cause to repent it. But you know him as well as I do, who would  not have thought his piety sincere?--who would not still think so? And  notwithstanding all you have said, I still hesitate to feel serious  alarm; I am unwilling to believe in such utter depravity.\"    The conversation continued in this strain for some time, and then, as it  was getting late, the party separated.    Next morning early, a large and noisy crowd was assembled in the rue  Saint-Victor before Derues' shop of drugs and groceries. There was a  confusion of cross questions, of inquiries which obtained no answer, of  answers not addressed to the inquiry, a medley of sound, a pell-mell of  unconnected words, of affirmations, contradictions, and interrupted  narrations. Here, a group listened to an orator who held forth in his  shirt sleeves, a little farther there were disputes, quarrels,  exclamations of \"Poor man!\" \"Such a good fellow!\" \"My poor gossip  Derues!\" \"Good heavens! what will he do now?\" \"Alas! he is quite done  for; it is to be hoped his creditors will give him time!\" Above all this  uproar was heard a voice, sharp and piercing like a cat's, lamenting,  and relating with sobs the terrible misfortune of last night. At about  three in the morning the inhabitants of the rue St. Victor had been  startled out of their sleep by the cry of \"Fire, fire!\" A conflagration  had burst forth in Derues' cellar, and though its progress had been  arrested and the house saved from destruction, all the goods stored  therein had perished. It apparently meant a considerable loss in barrels  of oil, casks of brandy, boxes of soap, etc., which Derues estimated at  not less than nine thousand livres.    By what unlucky chance the fire had been caused he had no idea. He  recounted his visit to Madame Legrand, and pale, trembling, hardly able  to sustain himself, he cried--    \"I shall die of grief! A poor man as ill as I am! I am lost! I am  ruined!\"    A harsh voice interrupted his lamentations, and drew the attention of  the crowd to a woman carrying printed broadsides, and who forced a  passage through the crowd up to the shop door. She unfolded one of her  sheets, and cried as loudly and distinctly as her husky voice  permitted--    \"Sentence pronounced by the Parliament of Paris against John Robert  Cassel, accused and convicted of Fraudulent Bankruptcy!\"    Derues looked up and saw a street-hawker who used to come to his shop  for a drink, and with whom he had had a violent quarrel about a month  previously, she having detected him in a piece of knavery, and abused  him roundly in her own style, which was not lacking in energy. He had  not seen her since. The crowd generally, and all the gossips of the  quarter, who held Derues in great veneration, thought that the woman's  cry was intended as an indirect insult, and threatened to punish her for  this irreverence. But, placing one hand on her hip, and with the other  warning off the most pressing by a significant gesture--    \"Are you still befooled by his tricks, fools that you are? Yes, no doubt  there was a fire in the cellar last night, no doubt his creditors will  be geese enough to let him off paying his debts! But what you don't know  is, that he didn't really lose by it at all!\"    \"He lost all his goods!\" the crowd cried on all sides. \"More than nine  thousand livres! Oil and brandy, do you think those won't burn? The old  witch, she drinks enough to know! If one put a candle near her she would  take fire, fast enough!\"    \"Perhaps,\" replied the woman, with renewed gesticulations, \"perhaps; but  I don't advise any of you to try. Anyhow, this fellow here is a rogue;  he has been emptying his cellar for the last three nights; there were  only old empty casks in it and empty packing-cases! Oh yes! I have  swallowed his daily lies like everybody else, but I know the truth by  now. He got his liquor taken away by Michael Lambourne's son, the  cobbler in the rue de la Parcheminerie. How do I know? Why, because the  young man came and told me!\"    \"I turned that woman out of my shop a month ago, for stealing,\" said  Derues.    Notwithstanding this retaliatory accusation, the woman's bold assertion  might have changed the attitude of the crowd and chilled the enthusiasm,  but at that moment a stout man pressed forward, and seizing the hawker  by the arm, said--    \"Go, and hold your tongue, backbiting woman!\"    To this man, the honour of Derues was an article of faith; he had not  yet ceased to wonder at the probity of this sainted person, and to doubt  it in the least was as good as suspecting his own.    \"My dear friend,\" he said, \"we all know what to think of you. I know you  well. Send to me tomorrow, and you shall have what goods you want, on  credit, for as long as is necessary. Now, evil tongue, what do you say  to that?\"    \"I say that you are as great a fool as the rest. Adieu, friend Derues;  go on as you have begun, and I shall be selling your 'sentence' some  day\"; and dispersing the crowd with a few twirls of her right arm, she  passed on, crying--    \"Sentence pronounced by the Parliament of Paris against John Robert  Cassel, accused and convicted of Fraudulent Bankruptcy!\"    This accusation emanated from too insignificant a quarter to have any  effect on Derues' reputation. However resentful he may have been at the  time, he got over it in consequence of the reiterated marks of interest  shown by his neighbours and all the quarter on account of his supposed  ruin, and the hawker's attack passed out of his mind, or probably she  might have paid for her boldness with her life.    But this drunken woman had none the less uttered a prophetic word; it  was the grain of sand on which, later, he was to be shipwrecked.    \"All passions,\" says La Bruyere,--\"all passions are deceitful; they  disguise themselves as much as possible from the public eye; they hide  from themselves. There is no vice which has not a counterfeit  resemblance to some virtue, and which does not profit by it.\"    The whole life of Derues bears testimony to the truth of this  observation. An avaricious poisoner, he attracted his victims by the  pretence of fervent and devoted piety, and drew them into the snare  where he silently destroyed them. His terrible celebrity only began in  1777, caused by the double murder of Madame de Lamotte and her son, and  his name, unlike those of some other great criminals, does not at first  recall a long series of crimes, but when one examines this low, crooked,  and obscure life, one finds a fresh stain at every step, and perhaps no  one has ever surpassed him in dissimulation, in profound hypocrisy, in  indefatigable depravity. Derues was executed at thirty-two, and his  whole life was steeped in vice; though happily so short, it is full of  horror, and is only a tissue of criminal thoughts and deeds, a very  essence of evil. He had no hesitation, no remorse, no repose, no  relaxation; he seemed compelled"]]]
