In London, he was the lion of the day: he was introduced to the  first circles, and saw whatever in a great city could elevate his ideas:  his manners acquired the polish of society. Grenville Sharpe (he who  secured the decision that the soil of Britain gives freedom to the slave  that touches it) endeavoured to improve his moral sentiments. He pointed  out the practical injustice of polygamy. Omai replied, \"one wife,  good--two wife, very good--three wife, very very good;\" but he had not  misunderstood the argument. Taking three knives, he put two of them side  by side, and the other at a distance, and referring to a nobleman who  had left his wife for a mistress, said--\"there Lord A., and there  Miss ----; and there Lady A. lie down and cry.\" (Life of G. Sharpe.)    But the moment he landed, he resumed all the customs of his countrymen,  and employed his knowledge of arms to destroy them. This was the only  trace of his civilisation which survived the voyage: he had seen regal  grandeur and mercantile power, but he retained his preference for the  habits of his then heathen race.]    [Footnote 2: \"But these good savages took hold of our arms, and  supported us.\"]        SECTION II.    The party dispatched from Sydney, to take possession of the island, and  who landed in August, on their arrival at Risdon saw nothing of the  natives. A solitary savage, armed with a spear, afterwards entered the  camp, and was cordially greeted. He accepted the trinkets which they  offered, but he looked on the novelties scattered about without  betraying surprise. By his gestures they inferred that he discharged  them from their trespass. He then turned towards the woods, and when  they attempted to follow, he placed himself in the attitude of menace,  and poised his spear.    On the 3rd of May, 1804, during the absence of Lieutenant Bowen, the  officer in command, the first severe collision occurred. Five hundred  blacks, supposed to belong to the Oyster Bay tribe, gathered on the  hills which overlooked the camp: their presence occasioned alarm, and  the convicts and soldiers were drawn up to oppose them. A discharge of  fire-arms threw them into momentary panic, but they soon re-united. A  second, of ball cartridge, brought down many; the rest fled in terror,  and were pursued: it is conjectured that fifty fell.    The accounts of this affair differ greatly. By one party they are said  to have assailed a man and woman living in advance of the camp, and to  have burned their hut. William White, who saw them earliest, and gave  notice of their approach, declared they then exhibited no hostility, and  were not near the hut before the collision. They came down in a  semicircle, carrying waddies but not spears; a flock of kangaroo hemmed  in between them. The women and children attended them. They came  singing, and bearing branches of trees.    This curvilinear mode of marching was noticed by Labillardiere: they  probably assembled for a corrobory. \"They looked at me,\" said the  witness, \"with all their eye;\" but they did not attempt to molest him.    For the British, it may be alleged that customs, afterwards understood,  were then less known. They were ignorant of the language and temper of  the blacks, and the preservation of the settlement was the first  military duty of Lieutenant Moore, who directed the fire. The action was  sudden, and perhaps no statement is exact. The natives were provoked, by  the occupation of their common place of resort, and it is no discredit  to their character, if even they attempted to expel the intruders.    A current report, respecting a conflict on the site of the hospital at  Hobart Town, received a curious exposition from the Rev. Mr. Knopwood.  It was a tradition, that a party of blacks assembled there, were  dispersed by a volley of grape shot, and that several fell. Human bones  and grape shot were found; but the reverend gentleman stated that the  bones were the remains of persons who came from India, and who were  buried there; and that the shot were accidentally dropped when the  stores, once kept there, were removed.    The consequences of these events were lamentable. The losses of the  natives, in their ordinary warfare, rarely extended beyond two or three;  but the havock of their new enemy awakened irremediable distrust. The  sorrows of a savage are transient: not so, his resentment. Every wrong  is new, until it is revenged; and there is no reason to suppose these  terrible sacrifices were ever forgotten.    In these collisions, no British subject had fallen; but in the  succeeding year (1805) a prisoner of the crown was speared, while  following a kangaroo; and two years after (1807) another, named Mundy,  met with a similar fate. The black had received presents from his hands,  and approaching him in pretended amity, trailed between his toes the  fatal spear. These facts are given to illustrate the cruelty of the  natives; and it may be presumed that, from the slaughter of Risdon, not  many could be added to the number. These were, however, the acts of  individuals, and without concert or much premeditation. It is  conjectured that the first European who perished was Mange, the surgeon  of the _Geographe_, in 1802. The attack was unprovoked, and it is said  unavenged.    The scarcity of food compelled the British to adopt a mode of life  somewhat resembling that of the aborigines. Germain, a marine, was  employed, from 1805 to 1810, in procuring kangaroo, which he hunted  with dogs: he but rarely carried a gun, slept on the ground in the  summer, and in the winter on the branches of trees. During his  wanderings, he often encountered the natives, but they offered no  violence; and he stated, as the result of his experience, that until  bushrangers excited them by cruelties, \"there was no harm in them.\" The  daughter of a settler of 1804, was left sometimes in their care; their  kindness was among the recollections of her childhood.    The prisoners were dispersed. The government, unable to supply the  common necessaries of life, gave them license to forage: labor could not  be exacted, nor discipline enforced; and when circumstances altered, it  was difficult to recall the wanderers, or to recover authority so long  relaxed. In their intercourse with the natives, licentious and cruel  outlaws committed every species of atrocity which could be suffered by  the weak in contact with the wicked.    Lord Hobart, under whose auspices the colony was planted, directed the  Lieutenant-Governor to conciliate the natives: to preserve them from  oppression, and to encourage them to resort for protection to his  authority. Their natural rights were recognised, but unhappily no  provision was made to define their interest in the soil of their  country. Their migratory habits were unfavorable to official  supervision, and the success of humane suggestions depended on the  doubtful concurrence of ignorant cotters and wandering shepherds.    In 1810, an order was issued by Governor Collins, forcibly describing  the wrongs of the natives, and the revenge to which they were prompted.  They had pursued an officer, residing at Herdsman's Cove, and failing to  capture him they fired his premises. Two persons, George Getley and  William Russell, had disappeared: it was supposed, the victims of  resentment, awakened by the \"abominable cruelties and murders\" (such is  the language of Collins) perpetrated by the white people. This Russell  was himself notorious for skill in their torture--the subject of his  boast. The government declared that persons who wantonly fired on the  natives, or murdered them \"in cold blood,\" should suffer the last  penalties of the law.[3]    The official treatment of the aborigines was not always judicious, or  calculated to impress the whites with the notion of civil equality. A  native, whom it was deemed desirable to detain, was fettered by Colonel  Collins. Notwithstanding, he escaped, and was seen long after with the  iron on his leg; nor can the punishments inflicted for crimes committed  against the blacks, unusual as those punishments were, be given in proof  that both races were valued alike. It is not, however, true, that  cruelty was always unpunished. A man was severely flogged for exposing  the ears of a boy he had mutilated; and another for cutting off the  little finger of a native, and using it as a tobacco stopper.[4]    The natives continued to shun the settlement for many years, but their  confidence was easily renewed by gentle treatment; it was, however,  capricious, or more probably it was soon shaken by insult, unknown to  all but themselves. It was desired by Colonel Davey to establish a  friendly intercourse, and he instructed the men to invite the tribes  they might encounter. A servant of this governor, employed at South Arm,  suddenly came on a tribe of thirty-six persons. A native woman, living  with a white, willingly went forth to communicate the wishes of the  Governor. They consented to visit Hobart Town, to which they were  transferred by water. Davey endeavoured to win their confidence, and  they remained about town for weeks. Having received some offence from  worthless Europeans, they retreated to their woods, and never returned.  This party attempted to reach Brune Island, and all were drowned, except  one woman.    Mr. Knopwood remembered that, in 1813 and 1814, the natives were fed at  his door. A number of children were forcibly taken from them, and they  disappeared from the camp.    Colonel Davey bears witness to the continuance of cruelty, which he  censured in the strongest language of indignation. Certain settlers  established a species of juvenile slavery: they followed up the mother,  retarded by the encumbrance of her children, until she was compelled in  her terror to leave them. Well might the Governor declare, that crime so  enormous had fixed a lasting stigma on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#3)"],[1,"that Hindu religion will reach for many  centuries. Not only is he described as supreme controller of the order  of nature--that is an attribute which these priestly poets ascribe  with generous inconsistency to many others of their deities--but he is  likewise the omniscient guardian of the moral law and the rule of  religion, sternly punishing sin and falsehood with his dreaded noose,  but showing mercy to the penitent and graciously communing with the  sage who has found favour in his eyes.    But Mitra and Varuna will not enjoy this exalted rank for long. Soon  the priests will declare that Mitra rules over the day and Varuna over  the night (TS. II. i. 7, 4; VI. iv. 8, 3), and then Varuna will begin  to sink in honour. The \"noose of Varuna\" will come to mean merely the  disease of dropsy. His connection with the darkness of the night will  cause men to think of him with fear; and in their dread they will  forget his ancient attributes of universal righteousness, justice, and  mercy, and remember him chiefly as an avenger of guilt. They will  banish him to the distant seas, whose rivers he now guides over the  earth in his gracious government of nature; and there he will dwell in  exile for ever, remembered only to be feared. And Mitra will become  merely another name for the sun.    What is the origin of this singular couple? And why are they destined  to this fall? Neither of these questions can be answered by anything  but conjectures. There is no evidence either from Indian or from  Iranian religion that Mitra or his double Varuna grew out of the  worship of the sun or the sky, although in their worship they were  sometimes connected with the sun and the sky. However far backwards we  look, we still find them essentially spirits of natural order and  moral law, gods in the higher sense of the word. But their character,  and especially the character of Varuna, it seems to me, is rather too  high to survive the competition of rival cults, such as that of the  popular hero Indra and the priests' darling Agni, which tend to  engross the interest of worshippers lay and cleric, and to blunt their  relish for more spiritual ideals. So Mitra and Varuna become stunted  in their growth; and at last comes the fatal time when they are  identified with the sky by day and night. This is the final blow. No  deity that is plainly limited to any one phase or form of nature in  India can be or become a great god; and speedily all their real  divinity fades away from Mitra and Varuna, and they shrivel into  insignificance.    Next we turn to a spirit of a very different sort, the Fire-god, Agni.  The word _agni_ is identical with the Latin _ignis_; it means \"fire,\"  and nothing else but fire, and this fact is quite sufficient to  prevent Agni from becoming a great god. The priests indeed do their  best, by fertile fancy and endless repetition of his praises, to lift  him to that rank; but even they cannot do it. From the days of the  earliest generations of men Fire was a spirit; and the household fire,  which cooks the food of the family and receives its simple oblations  of clarified butter, is a kindly genius of the home. But with all his  usefulness and elfish mystery Fire simply remains fire, and there's an  end of it, for the ordinary man. But the priests will not have it so.  The chief concern of their lives is with sacrifice, and their deepest  interest is in the spirit of the sacrificial fire. All the riches of  their imagination and their vocabulary are lavished upon him, his  forms and his activities. They have devoted to him about 200 hymns and  many occasional verses, in which they dwell with constant delight and  ingenious metaphor upon his splendour, his power, his birth from  wood, from the two firesticks, from trees of the forest, from stones,  or as lightning from the clouds, his kinship with the sun, his  dwelling in three abodes (viz. as a rule on earth, in the clouds as  lightning, and in the upper heavens as the sun), his place in the  homes of men as a holy guest, a friend and a kinsman, his protection  of worshippers against evil spirits and malignant sorcerers, and  especially his function of conveying the oblation poured into his  flames up to the gods. Thus they are led to represent him as the  divine Priest, the ideal hierophant, in whom are united the functions  of the three chief classes of Rigvedic sacrificial priests, the  _hota_, _adhvaryu_, and _brahman_, and hence as an all-knowing sage  and seer. If infinite zeal and ingenuity in singing Agni's praises and  glorifying his activities can avail to raise him to the rank of a  great god, we may expect to find him very near the top. But it is not  to be. The priests cannot convince the plain man of Agni's  super-godhead, and soon they will fail to convince even themselves.  The time will shortly come when they will regard all these gods as  little more than puppets whose strings are pulled by the mysterious  spirit of the sacrifice.    The priests have another pet deity, Soma. For the sacred rites include  the pressing and drinking of the fermented yellow juice of the  soma-plant, an acid draught with intoxicating powers, which when mixed  with milk and drunk in the priestly rites inspires religious ecstasy.  This drinking of the soma-juice is already an ancient and important  feature in the worship of our Aryans, as it is also among their  kinsmen in Iran; so it is no wonder that the spirit of the sacred  plant has been made by the priests into an important deity and  celebrated with endless abundance of praise and prayer. As with Agni,  Soma's appearance and properties are described with inexhaustible  wealth of epithets and metaphors. The poets love to dwell on the  mystic powers of this wonderful potion, which can heal sickness of  soul and body and inspire gods and men to mighty deeds and holy  ecstasy. Most often they tell how the god Indra drank huge potions of  it to strengthen himself for his great fight with the dragon Vritra.  Most of this worship is of priestly invention; voluminous as its  rhetoric is, it makes no great impression on the laity, nor perhaps on  the clergy either. Some of the more ingenious of the priests are  already beginning to trace an affinity between Soma and the moon. The  yellow soma-stalks swell in the water of the pressing-vat, as the  yellow moon waxes in the sky; the _soma_ has a magical power of  stimulation, and the moon sends forth a mystic liquid influence over  the vegetation of the earth, and especially over magic plants; the  soma is an ambrosia drunk by gods and heroes to inspire them to mighty  deeds, and the moon is a bowl of ambrosia which is periodically drunk  by the gods and therefore wanes month by month. The next step will  soon be taken, and the priests will say that Soma _is_ the moon; and  literature will then obediently accept this statement, and, gradually  forgetting nearly everything that Soma meant to the Rigvedic priests,  will use the name Soma merely as a secondary name for Chandra, the  moon and its god. A very illuminating process, which shows how a god  may utterly change his nature. Now we turn to the hero-gods.    Indra and the Asvina at the beginning came to be worshipped because  they were heroes, men who were supposed to have wrought marvellously  noble and valiant deeds in dim far-off days, saviours of the  afflicted, champions of the right, and who for this reason were  worshipped after death, perhaps even before death, as divine beings,  and gradually became associated in their legends and the forms of  their worship with all kinds of other gods. Times change, gods grow  old and fade away, but the remembrance of great deeds lives on in  strange wild legends, which, however much they may borrow from other  worships and however much they may be obscured by the phantom lights  of false fancy, still throw a glimmer of true light back through the  darkness of the ages into an immeasurably distant past.    Indra is a mighty giant, tawny of hair and beard and tawny of aspect.  The poets tell us that he bears up or stretches out earth and sky,  even that he has created heaven and earth. He is a monarch supreme  among the gods, the lord of all beings, immeasurable and irresistible  of power. He rides in a golden chariot drawn by two tawny horses, or  many horses, even as many as eleven hundred, and he bears as his chief  weapon the _vajra_, or thunderbolt, sometimes also a bow with arrows,  a hook, or a net. Of all drinkers of soma he is the lustiest; he  swills many lakes of it, and he eats mightily of the flesh of bulls  and buffaloes. To his worshippers he gives abundance of wealth and  happiness, and he leads them to victory over hostile tribes of Aryans  and the still more dreaded hordes of dark-skins, the Dasas and Dasyus.  He guided the princes Yadu and Turvasa across the rivers, he aided  Divodasa Atithigva to discomfit the dark-skinned Sambara, he gave to  Divodasa's son Sudas the victory over the armies of the ten allied  kings beside the river Parushni. Many are the names of the devils and  demons that have fallen before him; but most glorious of all his deeds  is the conquest of Vritra, the dragon dwelling in a mountain fastness  amidst the waters, where Indra, accompanied by the troop of Maruts, or  storm-gods, slew the monster with his bolt and set free the waters, or  recovered the hidden kine. Our poets sing endless variations on this  theme, and sometimes speak of Indra repeating the exploit for the  benefit of his worshippers, which is as much as to say that they, or  at least some of them, think it an allegory.    In all this maze of savage fancy and priestly invention and wild  exaggeration there are some points that stand out clearly. Indra is a  god of the people, particularly of the fighting man, a glorified type  of the fair-haired, hard-fighting, hard-drinking forefathers of the  Indian Aryans and their distant cousins the Hellenes; and"]]]
