In  order to make the magnitudes of the stars comparable with each other it  is convenient to reduce them to their value at a certain unit of  distance. As such we choose one siriometer. The corresponding magnitude  will be called the _absolute_ magnitude and is denoted by _M_.[4] We  easily find from the table given in the preceding paragraph that the  absolute magnitude of the sun, according to ZOeLLNER's value of _m_,  amounts to +3.4, of the moon to +31.2. For Jupiter we find _M_ = +24.6,  for Venus _M_ = +25.3. The other planets have approximately _M_ = +30.    For the absolute magnitudes of those stars for which it has hitherto  been possible to carry out a determination, we find a value of _M_  between -8 and +13. We shall give in the third chapter short tables of  the absolutely brightest and faintest stars now known.      8. _Photographic magnitudes._ The magnitudes which have been mentioned  in the preceding paragraphs all refer to observations taken with the  eye, and are called _visual_ magnitudes. The total intensity of a star  is, however, essentially dependent on the instrument used in measuring  the intensity. Besides the eye, the astronomers use a photographic  plate, bolometer, a photo-electric cell, and other instruments. The  difference in the results obtained with these instruments is due to the  circumstance that different parts of the radiation are taken into  account.    The usual photographic plates, which have their principal sensibility in  the violet parts of the spectrum, give us the _photographic_ magnitudes  of the stars. It is, however, to be remarked that these magnitudes may  vary from one plate to another, according to the distributive function  of the plate (compare L. M. 67). This variation, which has not yet been  sufficiently studied, seems however to be rather inconsiderable, and  must be neglected in the following.    The photographic magnitude of a star will in these lectures be denoted  by _m'_, corresponding to a visual magnitude _m_.    In practical astronomy use is also made of plates which, as the result  of a certain preparation (in colour baths or in other ways), have  acquired a distributive function nearly corresponding to that of the  eye, and especially have a maximum point at the same wave-lengths. Such  magnitudes are called _photo-visual_ (compare the memoir of PARKHURST in  A. J. 36 [1912]).    The photographic magnitude of a star is generally determined from  measurements of the diameter of the star on the plate. A simple  mathematical relation then permits us to determine _m'_. The diameter of  a star image increases with the time of exposure. This increase is due  in part to the diffraction of the telescope, to imperfect achromatism or  spherical aberration of the objective, to irregular grinding of the  glass, and especially to variations in the refraction of the air, which  produce an oscillation of the image around a mean position.    The _zero-point_ of the photographic magnitudes is so determined that  this magnitude coincides with the visual magnitude for such stars as  belong to the spectral type A0 and have _m_ = 6.0, according to the  proposal of the international solar conference at Bonn, 1911.    Determinations of the photographic or photo-visual magnitudes may now be  carried out with great accuracy. The methods for this are many and are  well summarised in the Report of the Council of the R. A. S. of the year  1913. The most effective and far-reaching method seems to be that  proposed by SCHWARZSCHILD, called the half-grating method, by which two  exposures are taken of the same part of the sky, while at one of the  exposures a certain grating is used that reduces the magnitudes by a  constant degree.      9. _Colour of the stars._ The radiation of a star is different for  different wave-lengths ([lambda]). As regarding other mass phenomena we  may therefore mention:--(1) the _total radiation_ or intensity (_I_),  (2) the _mean wave-length_ ([lambda]_0), (3) the _dispersion of the  wave-length_ ([sigma]). In the preceding paragraphs we have treated of  the total radiation of the stars as this is expressed through their  magnitudes. The mean wave-length is pretty closely defined by the  _colour_, whereas the dispersion of the wave-length is found from the  _spectrum_ of the stars.    There are blue (B), white (W), yellow (Y) and red (R) stars, and  intermediate colours. The exact method is to define the colour through  the mean wave-length (and not conversely) or the _effective_ wave-length  as it is most usually called, or from the _colour-index_. We shall  revert later to this question. There are, however, a great many direct  eye-estimates of the colour of the stars.    _Colour corresponding to a given spectrum._        _Sp._    _Colour_       _Number_       B3        YW-            161       A0        YW-            788       A5        YW             115       F5        YW, WY-        295       G5        WY             216       K5        WY+, Y-        552       M         Y, Y+           95       -----------------------------                       Sum ... 2222    _Spectrum corresponding to a given colour._        _Colour_       _Sp._       _Number_       W, W+          A0           281       YW-            A0           356       YW             A5           482       YW+, YW-       F3           211       WY             G4           264       WY+, Y-        K1           289       Y, Y+          K4           254       RY-, RY        K5            85       --------------------------------                          Sum ... 2222    The signs + and - indicate intermediate shades of colour.    The preceding table drawn up by Dr. MALMQUIST from the colour  observations of MUeLLER and KEMPF in Potsdam, shows the connection  between the colours of the stars and their spectra.    The Potsdam observations contain all stars north of the celestial  equator having an apparent magnitude brighter than 7m.5.    We find from these tables that there is a well-pronounced _regression_  in the correlation between the spectra and the colours of the stars.  Taking together all white stars we find the corresponding mean spectral  type to be A0, but to A0 corresponds, upon an average, the colour  yellow-white. The yellow stars belong in the mean to the K-type, but the  K-stars have upon an average a shade of white in the yellow colour. The  coefficient of correlation (_r_) is not easy to compute in this case,  because one of the attributes, the colour, is not strictly graduated  (_i.e._ it is not expressed in numbers defining the colour).[5] Using  the coefficient of contingency of PEARSON, it is, however, possible to  find a fairly reliable value of the coefficient of correlation, and  MALMQUIST has in this way found _r_ = +0.85, a rather high value.    In order to facilitate the discussion of the relation between colour and  spectrum it is convenient to deal here with the question of the spectra  of the stars.      10. _Spectra of the stars._ In order to introduce the discussion I first  give a list of the wave-lengths of the FRAUENHOFER lines in the  spectrum, and the corresponding chemical elements.        _FRAUENHOFER line_    _Element_       [lambda]         A                                   759.4         B                                   686.8         C([alpha])         H (hydrogen)     656.3         D_1                Na (sodium)      589.6         D_3                He               587.6         E                  Fe (iron)        527.0         F([beta])          H                486.2          ([gamma])         H                434.1         G                  Ca (calcium)     430.8         h([delta])         H                410.2         H([epsilon])       Ca(H)            396.9         K                  Ca               393.4    The first column gives the FRAUENHOFER denomination of each line.  Moreover the hydrogen lines [alpha], [beta], [gamma], [delta], [epsilon]  are denoted. The second column gives the name of the corresponding  element, to which each line is to be attributed. The third column gives  the wave-length expressed in millionths of a millimeter as unit  ([mu][mu]).    On plate III, where the classification of the stellar spectra according  to the Harvard system is reproduced, will be found also the wave-lengths  of the principal H and He lines.    By the visual spectrum is usually understood the part of the radiation  between the FRAUENHOFER lines A to H ([lambda] = 760 to 400 [mu][mu]),  whereas the photographic spectrum generally lies between F and K  ([lambda] = 500 to 400 [mu][mu]).    In the earliest days of spectroscopy the spectra of the stars were  classified according to their visual spectra. This classification was  introduced by SECCHI and was later more precisely defined by VOGEL. The  three classes I, II, III of VOGEL correspond approximately to the colour  classification into white, yellow, and red stars. Photography has now  almost entirely taken the place of visual observations of spectra, so  that SECCHI's and VOGEL's definitions of the stellar spectra are no  longer applicable. The terminology now used was introduced by PICKERING  and Miss CANNON and embraces a great many types, of which we here  describe the principal forms as they are defined in Part. II of Vol.  XXVIII of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory. It may be remarked that  PICKERING first arranged the types in alphabetical order A, B, C, &c.,  supposing that order to correspond to the temperature of the stars.  Later this was found to be partly wrong, and in particular it was found  that the B-stars may be hotter than those of type A. The following is  the temperature-order of the spectra according to the opinion of the  Harvard astronomers.    _Type O_ (WOLF-RAYET stars). The spectra of these stars consist mainly  of bright lines.

Other questions quickly followed, and Dick  told how he had started to get the tin box and gone down so  unexpectedly.    \"You want to be careful,\" he cautioned. \"This mountainside is full of  holes and pitfalls. I came down one hole and then shot right into  another.\"    \"And we did the same thing!\" cried Tom. \"Thank heaven none of us have  broken bones!\"    \"Didn't you hear us call to you?\" asked the youngest Rover.    \"I thought I heard something--but I was not sure. I called back.\"    \"We didn't hear you,\" answered Tom.    Dick had been trying to get out of the hole into which he had tumbled,  but without success. Now the sides were growing slippery from the rain,  so the ascent became more difficult than ever.    \"We're in a pickle,\" sighed Sam.    \"Oh, we've got to get out somehow,\" answered his big brother. \"We can't  stay here forever.\"    The opening was almost square, with three sides of rough rock. In trying  to climb up some of the rocks Tom gave one a shove and it slid from  sight, revealing an opening beyond.    \"Hullo! another hole!\" cried the youth, leaping back in consternation.  \"Why, the old mountain is fairly honeycombed with them.\"    \"I was never on this side of the mountain before,\" said Dick. \"They used  to tell some queer stories about this side.\"    \"Didn't they say some parts were haunted?\" asked Sam.    \"Yes, and it was said that, years ago, many travelers coming this way  disappeared.\"    \"Well, why shouldn't they, with so many holes around?\" came from Tom.  \"If we get out alive we'll be lucky.\"    With great care they got down on their hands and knees and examined the  opening beyond the rocks.    \"I believe it's a big cave,\" announced Dick a few minutes later. \"And if  it is, I'm rather inclined to look around inside. Perhaps it will lead  to some opening on the mountainside where we can get out.\"          CHAPTER III    A MYSTERIOUS CAVE      At first Sam and Tom demurred to entering the cave--which looked dark  and forbidding. But Dick insisted that he was going ahead, and rather  than be left behind they went along.    \"We'll light some kind of a torch,\" said the eldest Rover. \"Got some  matches?\"    \"Yes, I brought along a pocketful,\" answered Sam. \"Didn't know but what  we'd want to build a campfire this noon.\"    \"We'll want one now--to dry our clothing by,\" said Tom. \"Let us pick up  the driest of the sticks.\"    This they did, and having entered the cave, they made a good-sized  blaze. This sent a ruddy glow around the cavern, and as the boys moved  about fantastic shadows went dancing on the rocky walls, adding to the  weirdness of the scene.    From the fire each of the youths provided himself with a torch, and thus  equipped they moved around the cave with care, taking precautions not to  fall into any more holes. They soon found the opening on the  mountainside long and narrow and running downward.    \"We don't want to get lost,\" cautioned Sam.    \"Oh, we can always go back to the fire,\" answered Dick.    \"Unless it goes out on us.\"    \"It won't burn itself out for an hour--I saw to that before we left it.\"    As the boys advanced into the cave they came across a heap of bones.  Dick examined them carefully.    \"Skeletons?\" queried Sam, and his voice trembled slightly.    \"Yes--of lambs and pigs,\" was the dry answer. \"Somebody has been making  this a rendezvous and living on the fat of the land.\"    \"Maybe that accounts for Jerry Burden's losses,\" suggested Tom. \"He said  he lost a lamb last spring, and two pigs.\"    \"Yes, and old Richard Feltham lost a pig and some chickens,\" added Dick.  \"Maybe this has been a hangout for tramps.\"    \"Do you think they are here still?\" questioned Sam. \"We don't want to  have any trouble.\"    \"I am sure I don't know, Sam. But this proves one thing.\"    \"That we can get out of the cave?\"    \"Exactly. See, here is an old coat and a pair of old shoes. Somebody has  been in the habit of coming here--and he wasn't in the habit of getting  in the way we got in.\"    They moved on, and soon reached a larger opening. Here they found a bit  of old harness and, further on, where the ground was soft, the tracks of  wagon wheels.    \"Somebody has been in the habit of driving right in here!\" exclaimed  Tom. \"We are sure to get out!\" and his face showed his relief.    \"Hark! what's that?\" cried Sam, and shrank back as a strange rumbling  was heard. \"Is it an earthquake, or a landslide?\"    \"It's thunder, that's all,\" said Dick, a minute later, as they listened.    \"To be sure--the storm was on us when we fell into the first hole,\"  answered the youngest Rover.    \"Perhaps we can be glad we are under shelter--if the storm is going to  be a bad one,\" came from Tom. \"But, come on, I want to see daylight  again.\"    He moved on and then gave a cry of astonishment.    \"Look!\"    His brothers did so. On one side of the cave were piled thirty or forty  packing cases. The majority of them were empty, but three, directed to  one Jackson Dwight, Carwell, were full and nailed up.    \"Well, I never!\" murmured Sam. \"Dick----\"    \"The freight thieves!\" ejaculated the eldest Rover. \"Don't you remember  what was in the paper before we went south, and what was in again only  yesterday? They have been missing freight from Carwell and Boxton and  half a dozen other stations for over a year. The thieves must have  brought their stuff here and then taken some of it from the packing  cases and carted it away again.\"    \"It certainly looks like it,\" answered Tom. \"Only three full cases left.  I wonder when these were taken?\"    \"Most likely only a short time ago,\" said Dick. \"The cases look new.\"    \"Do you suppose any of the freight thieves are around? If they are we  want to keep out of their way--if they are desperate characters.\"    They moved on, and then Dick called a sudden halt.    \"I can see daylight ahead,\" he said. \"And somebody is moving around. Let  us put out the torches.\"    His suggestion was speedily followed, and the three Rover boys advanced  with caution. At its outer end the cave became broader while the roof  was only about ten feet high.    \"Hullo, here's another surprise,\" whispered Dick, as they came closer to  the opening. \"Look at that!\"    He pointed to one side of the cave and there the others saw an  automobile runabout standing and on the seat two men dressed for a tour.  They were talking to a third man, who was lounging against a front  wheel, smoking a brier-root pipe.    \"Maybe they are the freight thieves,\" whispered Tom. \"Let us get out of  sight and listen to what they have to say.\"    It was an easy matter to keep out of sight, for the walls of the cave  were very uneven at this point. They got behind a projection, and by  crawling up a rocky ledge managed to reach a point above and to one side  of the runabout and not over a dozen feet from it.    \"Then you weren't going to stop here, Merrick?\" asked the man leaning  against the wheel.    \"Not now, Dangler,\" was the reply of the man with the pipe. \"The storm  drove us in here.\"    \"When do you expect to meet this Randolph Rover?\"    \"Very soon.\"    \"He ought to be easy--he is so simple minded.\"    \"Oh, I think we can work him right enough,\" put in the third man, who  was tall and thin-cheeked.    \"Well, if you do, don't forget that I get my share, Pike,\" said the man  called Dangler.    \"Haven't you always gotten your share?\" demanded Pike.    \"I suppose I have.\"    \"And haven't we given you the information whenever any valuable freight  was coming this way?\" put in the man called Merrick.    \"Yes, and got your full share of the proceeds, while I ran the risk,\"  growled Dangler. \"It's getting dangerous--I'm going to quit--after the  next big haul,\" went on the man with the pipe.    \"All right--as you wish,\" answered Merrick. \"I wish this storm would let  up. The road will be something fierce for our runabout.\"    \"And bad for my wagon,\" growled Dangler in return.    The boys listened to the conversation with deep interest. The reference  to their uncle amazed them, and they wondered what the two men in the  runabout had in mind to do. By their talk it was evident they meant to  accomplish something unlawful.    \"They are going to play Uncle Randolph some trick,\" whispered Sam. \"We  must get home and warn him.\"    \"What we ought to do is to have the whole crowd arrested,\" answered Tom.  \"They are all implicated in the theft of freight.\"    \"That's the talk,\" said Dick. \"The question is, How can we do it? We are  no match for those three men, and more than likely they are armed.\"    After this the three men conversed in such a low tone the boys could not  hear a quarter of what was said. But they learned enough to know that  Merrick and Pike were going to meet their uncle and play him false in  some way, and they heard the words \"traction bonds\" and \"coupons\"  several times.    \"Uncle Randolph had ten thousand dollars' worth of traction company  bonds,\" said Dick. \"He bought them only a short while ago. They pay five  and a half per cent. interest and he thought them a first-class  investment.\"    \"Oh, we'll have to warn him,\" said Sam. \"He is so open-hearted he would  trust most anybody.\"    Merrick had descended from the runabout and gone out of the cave. Now he  came back, said something to the others, and started up the auto. In  another moment he had the machine turned around. Then it spun out of the  cave and down a fairly good road in the direction of Carwell. The man  named Dangler followed the runabout to the road and watched it disappear  around a turn bordered by trees. The storm was now rolling away to the  westward and the rain had ceased.    \"They have gone!\" cried Tom. \"Where to?\"    \"Perhaps to our farm--to see Uncle Randolph,\" answered Sam. \"We ought to  follow them as quickly as we can.\"    \"I think we had better capture the fellow left behind,\" said Dick. \"We  ought to be able to do it.\"    \"That's the talk,\""]]]
