PREAMBLE           Student and Apprentice, their Aims and Conditions of       Work--Necessity for some Equality between       Theory and Practise--The Student's Opportunity       lies on the Side of Design.      The study of some form of handicraft has of late years become an  important element in the training of an art student. It is with the  object of assisting such with practical directions, as well as  suggesting to more practised carvers considerations of design and  treatment, that the present volume has been written. The art of  wood-carving, however, lends itself to literary demonstration only in a  very limited way, more especially in the condensed form of a text-book,  which must be looked upon merely as a temporary guide, of use only until  such time as practise and study shall have strengthened the judgment of  the student, and enabled him to assimilate the many and involved  principles which underlie the development of his craft.    If the beginner has mastered to some extent the initial difficulties of  the draftsman, and has a fair general knowledge of the laws of design,  but no acquaintance with their application to the art of wood-carving,  then the two factors which will most immediately affect his progress  (apart from natural aptitude) are his opportunities for practise, and  his knowledge of past and present conditions of work. No one can become  a good carver without considerable practise--constant, if the best  results are to be looked for. Just as truly, without some knowledge of  past and existing conditions of practise, none may hope to escape the  danger of becoming, on the one hand, dull imitators of the superficial  qualities of old work; or on the other, followers of the first  will-o'-the-wisp novelty which presents itself to their fancy.    If use of the tools and knowledge of materials were the only subjects of  which a carver need become master, there would be no way equal to the  old-fashioned one of apprenticeship to some good craftsman. Daily  practise with the tools insures a manual dexterity with which no amateur  need hope to compete. Many traditional expedients are handed down in  this way that can be acquired in no other. There is, however, another  side of the question to be considered, of quite as much importance as  the practical one of handicraft skill. The art of wood-carving has also  to fulfil its intellectual function, as an interpreter of the dreams and  fancies of imagination. In this respect there is little encouragement to  be looked for in the dull routine of a modern workshop.    There are, therefore, two widely separated standpoints from which the  art may be viewed. It may be looked at from the position of a regular  craftsman, who regards it primarily as his means of livelihood; or it  may be dealt with as a subject of intellectual interest, based upon its  relation to the laws of art in general. As, in the first instance, the  use of the tools can not be learned without _some_ accompanying  knowledge of the laws of art, however slight that acquaintance may be,  the method of apprenticeship has the advantage of being the more  practical of the two; but it must be accepted with all the conditions  imposed upon it by the pressure of commercial interest and its usages:  conditions, which, it may easily be imagined, are far more favorable to  the performance of dull task-work, than to the adventurous spirit of  curiosity which should prompt the enterprise of an energetic student.    On the other hand, although an independent study of the art offers a  wider range of interest, the student is, for that very reason, exposed  to the risk of involving himself in a labyrinth of confusing and  ineffectual theories. The fact is, that neither method can at the  present time be exclusively depended upon as a means of development;  neither can be pronounced complete in itself nor independent of the  other. The only sure safeguard against the vagueness of theory is  constant practise with the tools; while, to the craftsman in the full  enjoyment of every means for exercising and increasing his technical  skill, a general study and intelligent conception of the wide  possibilities of his art is just as essential, if it were only as an  antidote to the influence of an otherwise mechanical employment. The  more closely these contradictory views are made to approximate, the  more certain will become the carver's aims, and the clearer will be his  understanding of the difficulties which surround his path, enabling him  to choose that which is practicable and intrinsically valuable, both as  regards the theory and practise of his art.    If the student, through lack of opportunities for practise, is debarred  from all chance of acquiring that expertness which accompanies great  technical skill, he may at least find encouragement in the fact that he  can never exhaust the interest afforded by his art in its infinite  suggestion to the imagination and fancy; and also that by the exercise  of diligence, and a determination to succeed, he may reasonably hope to  gain such a degree of proficiency with the tools as will enable him to  execute with his hands every idea which has a definite existence in his  mind. Generally speaking, it will be found that his manual powers are  always a little in advance of his perceptions.    Thus the student may gradually work out for himself a natural and  reliable manner of expressing his thoughts, and in a way, too, that is  likely to compensate for his technical shortcomings, by exciting a more  lively interest in the resources of the art itself. The measure of his  success will be determined partly by his innate capacity for the work,  and partly by the amount of time which he is enabled to give to its  practise. The resources of his art offer an infinite scope for the  exercise of his powers of design, and as this is the side which lies  nearest to his opportunities it should be the one which receives his  most earnest attention, not merely as experiments on paper, but as  exercises carried out to the best of his ability with the tools. Such  technical difficulties as he may encounter in the process will gradually  disappear with practise. There is also encouragement in the thought that  wood-carving is an art which makes no immediate calls upon that  mysterious combination of extraordinary gifts labeled \"genius,\" but is  rather one which demands tribute from the bright and happy inspirations  of a normally healthy mind. There is, in this direction, quite a life's  work for any enthusiast who aims at finding the bearings of his own  small but precious gift, and in making it intelligible to others; while,  at the same time, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22108"],[0,"The Untroubled Mind (#3)"],[1,"WORK          I wish I had a trade!--It would animate my arms and tranquilize      my brain.                  SENANCOUR.        \"Doe ye nexte thynge.\"--_Old English Proverb_.    Since our minds are so constantly filled with anxiety, there would seem  to be at least one sure way to be rid of it--to stop thinking.    A great many people believe that the mind will become less effective,  that life will become dull and purposeless, unless they are constantly  thinking and planning and arranging their affairs. I believe that the  mind may easily and wisely be free from conscious thought a good deal of  the time, and that the greatest progress and development in mind often  comes when the thinker is virtually at rest, when his mind is to all  intents and purposes blank. The busy, unconscious mind does its best  work in the serenity of an atmosphere which does not interfere and  confuse.    It is true that the greatest conceptions do not come to the untrained  and undisciplined mind. But do we want great conceptions all the time?  There is a technical training for the mind which is, of course,  necessary for special accomplishments, but this is quite another matter.  Even this kind of thought must not obtrude too much, lest we become  conscious of our mental processes and so end in confusion.    One of the greatest benefits of work with the hands, or of objective and  constructive work with the mind, is that it saves us from unending hours  of thinking. Work should, of course, find its fullest justification as  an expression of faith. If we have ever so dim a vision of a greater  significance in life, of its close relationship to infinite things, we  become thereby conscious of the need of service, of the need of work. It  is the easy, natural expression of our faith, the inevitable result of  a spiritual contact with the great working forces of the world. It is  work above all else that saves us from the disasters of conflicting  thought.    A few years ago a young man came to me, suffering from too much  thinking. He had just been graduated from college and his head was full  of confused ideas and emotions. He was also very tired, having  overworked in his preparation for examinations, and because he had not  taken the best care of his body. The symptoms he complained of were  sleeplessness and worry, together with the inevitable indigestion and  headache. Of course, as a physician, I went over the bodily functions  carefully, and studied, as far as I might, into the organic conditions.  I could find no evidence of physical disease. I did not say, \"There is  nothing the matter with you\"; for the man was sick. I told him that he  was tired, that he had thought too much, that he was too much concerned  about himself, and that as a result of all this his bodily functions  were temporarily upset. He thought he ought to worry about himself,  because otherwise he would not be trying to get well. I explained to him  that this mistaken obligation was the common reason for worry, and that  in this case, at least, it was quite unnecessary and even harmful for  him to go on thinking about himself. That helped a little, but not  nearly enough, because when a man has overworked, when he has begun to  worry, and when his various bodily functions show results of worry, no  reasoning, no explanations, can wholly relieve him. I said to this young  man, \"In spite of your discomforts, in spite of your depression and  concern in regard to yourself, you will get well if you will stop  thinking about the matter altogether. You must be first convinced that  it is best for you to stop thinking, that no harm or violence can  result, and then you must be helped in this direction by going to work  with your hands--that will be life and progress, it will lead you to  health.\"    Fortunately I had had some experience with nervous illness, and I knew  that unless I managed for this man the character and extent of his work,  he would not only fail in it, but of its object, and so become more  confused and discouraged. I knew the troubled mind, in this instance,  might find its solace and its relief in work, but that I must choose the  work carefully to suit the individual, and I must see that the nervously  fatigued body was not pushed too hard.    In the town where I live is a blacksmith shop, presided over by a genial  old man who has been a blacksmith since he was a boy, and in whose hands  iron is like clay. I took my patient down to the smithy and said, \"Here  is a young man whom I want to put to work. He will pay for the chance. I  want you first to teach him to make hand-wrought nails.\" This was a  good deal of a joke to the smith and to the patient, but they saw that I  was in earnest and agreed to go ahead. We got together the proper tools  and proceeded to make nails, a job which is really not very difficult.  After an hour's work, I called off my patient, much to his disgust, for  he was just beginning to be interested. But I knew that if he were to  keep on until fatigue should come, the whole matter would end in  trouble. So the next day, with some new overalls and a leather apron  added to the equipment, we proceeded to another hour's work. We went on  this way for three or four days, before the time was increased.    The interest of the patient was always fresh, he was eager for more, and  he did not taste the dregs of fatigue. Yet he did get the wholesome  exercise, and he did get the strong turning of the mind from its worry  and concern. Of course, the rest of the day was taken care of in one  way or another, but the work was the central feature. In a week, we were  at it two hours a day, in three weeks, four hours, and in a month, five  hours. He had made a handsome display of hand-wrought nails, a superior  line of pokers and shovels for fireplaces, together with a number of  very respectable andirons. On each of these larger pieces of handiwork  my patient had stamped his initials with a little steel die that was  made for him. Each piece was his own, each piece was the product of his  own versatility and his own strength. His pride and pleasure in this  work were very great, and well they might be, for it is a fine thing to  have learned to handle so intractable a material as iron. But in  handling the iron patiently and consistently until he could do it  without too much conscious thinking, and so without effort, he had also  learned to handle himself naturally, more simply and easily.    As a matter of fact, the illness which had brought this boy to me was  pretty nearly cured by his blacksmithing, because it was an illness of  the mind and of the nerves, and not of the body, although the body had  suffered in its turn. That young man, instead of becoming a nervous  invalid as he might have done, is now working steadily in partnership  with his father, in business in the city. I had found him a very  interesting patient, full of originality and not at all the tedious and  boresome person he might have been had I listened day after day, week  after week to the recital of his ills. I was willing to listen,--I did  listen,--but I also gave him a new trend of life, which pretty soon made  his complaints sound hollow and then disappear.    Of course, the problem is not always so simple as this, and we must  often deal with complexities of body and mind requiring prolonged  investigation and treatment. I cite this case because it shows clearly  that relief from some forms of nervous illness can come when we stop  thinking, when we stop analyzing, and then back up our position with  prescribed work.    There may be some nervous invalids who read these lines who will say,  \"But I have tried so many times to work and have failed.\" Unfortunately,  such failure must often occur unless we can proceed with care and with  understanding. But the principle remains true, although it must be  modified in an infinite variety to meet the changing conditions of  individuals.    I see a great many people who are conscientiously trying to get well  from nervous exhaustion. They almost inevitably try too hard. They think  and worry too much about it, and so exhaust themselves the more. This is  the greater pity because it is the honest and the conscientious people  who make the greatest effort. It is very hard for them to realize that  they must stop thinking, stop trying, and if possible get to work  before they can accomplish their end. We shall have to repeat to them  over and over again that they must stop thinking the matter out, because  the thing they are attempting to overcome is too subtle to be met in  that way. So, if they are fortunate, they may rid themselves of the  vagueness and uncertainty of life, until all the multitude of details  which go to make up life lose their desultoriness and their lack of  meaning, and they may find themselves no longer the subjects of physical  or nervous exhaustion.

Extreme busyness, whether at school or college, kirk or market,      is a symptom of deficient vitality; and a faculty for idleness      implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal      identity.                  STEVENSON.    It is an unfortunate fact that very few people are able to be idle  successfully. I think it is not so much because we misuse idleness as  because we misinterpret it that the long days become increasingly  demoralizing. I would ask no one to accept a forced idleness without  objection or regret. Such an acceptance would imply a lack of spirit, to  say the least. But idleness and rest are not incompatible; neither are  idleness and service, nor idleness and contentment. If we can look upon  rest as a preparation for service, if we can make it serve us in the  opportunity it gives for quiet growth and legitimate enjoyment, then it  is fully"]]]
