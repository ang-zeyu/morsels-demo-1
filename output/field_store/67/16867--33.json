His store  of nuts may or may not be all consumed; it is certain that he is no  sluggard, to sleep away these first bright warm days.    Before the first crocus is out of the ground, you may look for the first  chipmunk. When I hear the little downy woodpecker begin his spring  drumming, then I know the chipmunk is due. He cannot sleep after that  challenge of the woodpecker reaches his ear.    Apparently the first thing he does on coming forth, as soon as he is  sure of himself, is to go courting. So far as I have observed, the  love-making of the chipmunk occurs in March. A single female will  attract all the males in the vicinity. One early March day I was at work  for several hours near a stone fence, where a female had apparently  taken up her quarters. What a train of suitors she had that day! how  they hurried up and down, often giving each other a spiteful slap or  bite as they passed. The young are born in May, four or five at a birth.    The chipmunk is quite a solitary creature; I have never known more than  one to occupy the same den. Apparently no two can agree to live  together. What a clean, pert, dapper, nervous little fellow he is! How  fast his heart beats, as he stands up on the wall by the roadside, and,  with hands spread out upon his breast, regards you intently! A movement  of your arm, and he darts into the wall with a saucy _chip-r-r_, which  has the effect of slamming the door behind him.    On some still day in autumn, one of the nutty days, the woods will  often be pervaded by an undertone of sound, produced by their  multitudinous clucking, as they sit near their dens. It is one of the  characteristic sounds of fall.    I was much amused one October in watching a chipmunk carry nuts and  other food into his den. He had made a well-defined path from his door  out through the weeds and dry leaves into the territory where his  feeding-ground lay. The path was a crooked one; it dipped under weeds,  under some large, loosely piled stones, under a pile of chestnut posts,  and then followed the remains of an old wall. Going and coming, his  motions were like clock-work. He always went by spurts and sudden  sallies. He was never for one moment off his guard. He would appear at  the mouth of his den, look quickly about, take a few leaps to a tussock  of grass, pause a breath with one foot raised, slip quickly a few yards  over some dry leaves, pause again by a stump beside a path, rush across  the path to the pile of loose stones, go under the first and over the  second, gain the pile of posts, make his way through that, survey his  course a half moment from the other side of it, and then dart on to some  other cover, and presently beyond my range, where I think he gathered  acorns, as there were no other nut-bearing trees than oaks near. In four  or five minutes I would see him coming back, always keeping rigidly to  the course he took going out, pausing at the same spots, darting over or  under the same objects, clearing at a bound the same pile of leaves.  There was no variation in his manner of proceeding all the time I  observed him.    He was alert, cautious, and exceedingly methodical. He had found safety  in a certain course, and he did not at any time deviate a hair's breadth  from it. Something seemed to say to him all the time, \"Beware, beware!\"  The nervous, impetuous ways of these creatures are no doubt the result  of the life of fear which they lead.    My chipmunk had no companion. He lived all by himself in true hermit  fashion, as is usually the case with this squirrel. Provident creature  that he is, one would think that he would long ago have discovered that  heat, and therefore food, is economized by two or three nesting  together.    [Illustration: CHIPMUNK]    One day in early spring, a chipmunk that lived near me met with a  terrible adventure, the memory of which will probably be handed down  through many generations of its family. I was sitting in the  summer-house with Nig the cat upon my knee, when the chipmunk came out  of its den a few feet away, and ran quickly to a pile of chestnut posts  about twenty yards from where I sat. Nig saw it, and was off my lap upon  the floor in an instant. I spoke sharply to the cat, when she sat down  and folded her paws under her, and regarded the squirrel, as I thought,  with only a dreamy kind of interest. I fancied she thought it a hopeless  case there amid that pile of posts. \"That is not your game, Nig,\" I  said, \"so spare yourself any anxiety.\" Just then I was called to the  house, where I was detained about five minutes. As I returned I met Nig  coming to the house with the chipmunk in her mouth. She had the air of  one who had won a wager. She carried the chipmunk by the throat, and its  body hung limp from her mouth. I quickly took the squirrel from her, and  reproved her sharply. It lay in my hand as if dead, though I saw no  marks of the cat's teeth upon it. Presently it gasped for its breath,  then again and again. I saw that the cat had simply choked it. Quickly  the film passed off its eyes, its heart began visibly to beat, and  slowly the breathing became regular. I carried it back, and laid it down  in the door of its den. In a moment it crawled or kicked itself in. In  the afternoon I placed a handful of corn there, to express my sympathy,  and as far as possible make amends for Nig's cruel treatment.    Not till four or five days had passed did my little neighbor emerge  again from its den, and then only for a moment. That terrible black  monster with the large green-yellow eyes,--it might be still lurking  near. How the black monster had captured the alert and restless squirrel  so quickly, under the circumstances, was a great mystery to me. Was not  its eye as sharp as the cat's, and its movements as quick? Yet cats do  have the secret of catching squirrels, and birds, and mice, but I have  never yet had the luck to see it done.    It was not very long before the chipmunk was going to and from her den  as usual, though the dread of the black monster seemed ever before her,  and gave speed and extra alertness to all her movements. In early summer  four young chipmunks emerged from the den, and ran freely about. There  was nothing to disturb them, for, alas! Nig herself was now dead.    One summer day I watched a cat for nearly a half hour trying her arts  upon a chipmunk that sat upon a pile of stone. Evidently her game was to  stalk him. She had cleared half the distance, or about twelve feet, that  separated the chipmunk from a dense Norway spruce, when I chanced to  become a spectator of the little drama. There sat the cat crouched low  on the grass, her big, yellow eyes fixed upon the chipmunk, and there  sat the chipmunk at the mouth of his den, motionless, with his eyes  fixed upon the cat. For a long time neither moved. \"Will the cat bind  him with her fatal spell?\" I thought. Sometimes her head slowly lowered  and her eyes seemed to dilate, and I fancied she was about to spring.  But she did not. The distance was too great to be successfully cleared  in one bound. Then the squirrel moved nervously, but kept his eye upon  the enemy. Then the cat evidently grew tired and relaxed a little and  looked behind her. Then she crouched again and riveted her gaze upon the  squirrel. But the latter would not be hypnotized; he shifted his  position a few times and finally quickly entered his den, when the cat  soon slunk away.    In digging his hole it is evident that the chipmunk carries away the  loose soil. Never a grain of it is seen in front of his door. Those  pockets of his probably stand him in good stead on such occasions. Only  in one instance have I seen a pile of earth before the entrance to a  chipmunk's den, and that was where the builder had begun his house late  in November, and was probably too much hurried to remove this ugly mark  from before his door. I used to pass his place every morning in my walk,  and my eye always fell upon that little pile of red, freshly-dug soil.  A little later I used frequently to surprise the squirrel furnishing his  house, carrying in dry leaves of the maple and plane tree. He would  seize a large leaf and with both hands stuff it into his cheek pockets,  and then carry it into his den. I saw him on several different days  occupied in this way. I trust he had secured his winter stores, though I  am a little doubtful. He was hurriedly making himself a new home, and  the cold of December was upon us while he was yet at work. It may be  that he had moved the stores from his old quarters, wherever they were,  and again it may be that he had been dispossessed of both his house and  provender by some other chipmunk.    I have been told by a man who says he has seen what he avers, that the  reason why we do not find a pile of fresh earth beside the hole of the  chipmunk is this: In making his den the workman continues his course  through the soil a foot or more under the surface for several yards,  carrying out the earth in his cheek pouches and dumping it near the  entrance. Then he comes to the surface and makes a new hole from  beneath, which is, of course, many feet from the first hole. This latter  is now closed up, and henceforth the new one alone is used. I have no  doubt this is the true explanation.    When nuts or grain are not to be had, these thrifty little creatures  will find some substitute to help them over the winter. Two chipmunks  near my study were occupied many days in carrying in cherry pits which  they gathered beneath a large cherry-tree that stood ten or twelve rods  away. As Nig was no longer about to molest them, they grew very  fearless, and used to spin up and down the garden path to and from their  source of supplies in a way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],[0,"Blue-Bird Weather (#3)"],[1,"him.    The bitter chill smote him. Cursing the simple life, he crawled gingerly  out of bed, suffered acutely while hunting for a match, lighted the  kerosene lamp with stiffened fingers, and looked about him, shivering.  Then, with a suppressed anathema, he stepped into his folding tub and  emptied the arctic contents of the water pitcher over himself.    Half an hour later he appeared at the breakfast table, hungrier than he  had been in years. There was nobody there to wait on him, but the dishes  and coffee pot were piping hot, and he madly ate eggs and razor-back,  and drank quantities of coffee, and finally set fire to a cigarette,  feeling younger and happier than he had felt for ages.    Of one thing he was excitedly conscious: that dreadful and persistent  dragging feeling at the nape of his neck had vanished. It didn't seem  possible that it could have disappeared overnight, but it had, for the  present, at least.    He went into the sitting room. Nobody was there, either, so he broke his  sealed shell boxes, filled his case with sixes and fives and double B's,  drew his expensive ducking gun from its case and took a look at it,  buckled the straps of his hip boots to his belt, felt in the various  pockets of his shooting coat to see whether matches, pipe, tobacco,  vaseline, oil, shell extractor, knife, handkerchief, gloves, were in  their proper places; found them so, and, lighting another cigarette,  strolled contentedly around the small and almost bare room, bestowing a  contented and patronizing glance upon each humble article and decoration  as he passed.    Evidently this photograph, in an oval frame of old-time water gilt, was  a portrait of Miss Herold's mother. What a charming face, with its  delicate, high-bred nose and lips! The boy, Jim, had her mouth and nose,  and his sister her eyes, slightly tilted to a slant at the outer  corners--beautifully shaped eyes, he remembered.    He lingered a moment, then strolled on, viewing with tolerant  indifference the few poor ornaments on the mantel, the chromos of wild  ducks and shore birds, and found himself again by the lamp-lit table  from which he had started his explorations.    On it were Jim's Latin book, a Bible, and several last year's magazines.    Idly he turned the flyleaf of the schoolbook. Written there was the  boy's name--\"Jim, from Daddy.\"    As he was closing the cover a sudden instinct arrested his hand, and,  not knowing exactly why, he reopened the book and read the inscription  again. He read it again, too, with a vague sensation of familiarity with  it, or with the book, or something somehow connected with it, he could  not tell exactly what; but a slightly uncomfortable feeling remained as  he laid aside the book and stood with brows knitted and eyes absently  bent on the stove.    The next moment Jim came in, wearing a faded overcoat which he had  outgrown.    \"Hello!\" said Marche, looking up. \"Are you ready for me, Jim?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What sort of a chance have I?\"    \"I'm afraid it is blue-bird weather,\" said the boy diffidently.    Marche scowled, then smiled. \"Your sister said it would probably be that  kind of weather. Well, we all have to take a sporting chance with things  in general, don't we, Jim?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Marche picked up his gun case and cartridge box. The boy offered to take  them, but the young man shook his head.    \"Lead on, old sport!\" he said cheerily. \"I'm a beast of more burdens  than you know anything about. How's your father, by the way?\"    \"I think father is about the same.\"    \"Doesn't he need a doctor?\"    \"No, sir, I think not.\"    \"What is it, Jim? Fever?\"    \"I don't know,\" said the boy, in a low voice. He led the way, and Marche  followed him out of doors.    A gray light made plain the desolation of the scene, although the sun  had not yet risen. To the south and west the sombre pine woods stretched  away; eastward, a few last year's cornstalks stood, withered in the  clearing, through which a rutted road ran down to the water.    \"It isn't the finest farming land in the world, is it, Jim?\" he said  humorously.    \"I haven't seen any other land,\" said the boy quietly.    \"Don't you remember the Northern country at all?\"    \"No, sir--except Central Park.\"    \"Oh, you were New-Yorkers?\"    \"Yes, sir. Father----\" and he fell abruptly silent.    They were walking together down the rutted road, and Marche glanced  around at him.    \"What were you going to say about your father, Jim?\"    \"Nothing.\" Then truth jogged his arm. \"I mean I was only going to say  that father and mother and all of us lived there.\"    \"In New York?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Is your--your mother living?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"I think I saw her picture in the sitting room,\" he said gently. \"She  must have been everything a mother should be.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Was it long ago, Jim?\"    \"When she died?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Yes, very long ago. Six years ago.\"    \"Before you came here, then?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    After they had walked in silence for a little while, Marche said, \"I  suppose you have arranged for somebody to take me out?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    They emerged from the lane to the shore at the same moment, and Marche  glanced about for the expected bayman.    \"Oh, there he is!\" he said, as a figure came from behind a dory and  waded leisurely shoreward through the shallows--a slight figure in hip  boots and wool shooting hood and coat, who came lightly across the sands  to meet him. And, astonished, he looked into the gray eyes of Molly  Herold.    \"Father could not take you,\" she said, without embarrassment, \"and Jim  isn't quite big enough to manage the swans and geese. Do you mind my  acting as your bayman?\"    \"Mind?\" he repeated. \"No, of course not. Only--it seems rather rough on  you. Couldn't you have hired a bayman for me?\"    \"I will, if you wish,\" she said, her cheeks reddening. \"But, really, if  you'll let me, I am perfectly accustomed to bayman's work.\"    \"Do you _want_ to do it?\"    She said, without self-consciousness, \"If it is the same to you, Mr.  Marche, I had rather that the bayman's wages came to us.\"    \"Certainly--of course,\" he said hurriedly. Then, smiling: \"You look the  part. I took you for a young man, at first. Now, tell me how I can help  you.\"    \"Jim can do that. Still, if you don't mind handling the decoys----\"    \"Not at all,\" he said, going up to the fenced inclosures which ran from  a rod or two inland down into the shallow water, making three separate  yards for geese, swans, and ducks.    Jim was already in the duck pen, hustling the several dozen mallard and  black ducks into an inland corral. The indignant birds, quacking a  concerted protest, waddled up from the shore, and, one by one, the boy  seized the suitable ones, and passed them over the fence to Marche. He  handed them to Molly Herold, who waded out to the dory, a duck tucked  under either arm, and slipped them deftly into the decoy-crates forward  and aft.    The geese were harder to manage--great, sleek, pastel-tinted birds whose  wing blows had the force of a man's fist--and they flapped and  struggled and buffeted Jim till his blonde head spun; but at last Marche  and Molly had them crated in the dory.    Then the wild swans' turn came--great, white creatures with black beaks  and feet; and Molly and Marche were laughing as they struggled to catch  them and carry them aboard.    But at last every decoy was squatting in the crates; the mast had been  stepped, guns laid aboard, luncheon stowed away. Marche set his shoulder  to the stern; the girl sprang aboard, and he followed; the triangular  sail filled, and the boat glided out into the sound, straight into the  glittering lens of the rising sun.    A great winter gull flapped across their bows; in the lee of Starfish  Island, long strings of wild ducks rose like shredded clouds, and,  swarming in the sky, swinging, drifting, sheered eastward, out toward  the unseen Atlantic.    \"Bluebills and sprigs,\" said the girl, resting her elbow on the tiller.  \"There are geese on the shoal, yonder. They've come out from Currituck.  Oh, I'm afraid it's to be blue-bird weather, Mr. Marche.\"    \"I'm afraid it is,\" he assented, smiling. \"What do you do in that case,  Miss Herold?\"    \"Go to sleep in the blind,\" she admitted, with a faint smile, the first  delicate approach to anything resembling the careless confidence of  camaraderie that had yet come from her.    \"See the ducks!\" she said, as bunch after bunch parted from the water,  distantly, yet all around them, and, gathering like clouds of dusky  bees, whirled away through the sky until they seemed like bands of smoke  high drifting. Presently she turned and looked back, signaling adieu to  the shore, where her brother lifted his arm in response, then turned  away inland.    \"That's a nice boy,\" said Marche briefly, and glanced up to see in his  sister's face the swift and exquisite transformation that requires no  words as answer.    \"You seem to like him,\" said he, laughing.    Molly Herold's gray eyes softened; pride, that had made the love in  them brilliant, faded until they grew almost sombre. Silent, her aloof  gaze remained fixed on the horizon; her lips rested on each other in  sensitive curves. There was no sound save the curling of foam under the  bows.    Marche looked elsewhere; then looked at her again. She sat motionless,  gray eyes remote, one little, wind-roughened hand on the tiller. The  steady breeze filled the sail; the dory stood straight away toward the  blinding glory of the sunrise.    Through the unreal golden light, raft after raft of wild ducks rose and  whirled into the east; blue herons flopped across the water; a  silver-headed eagle, low over the waves, winged his way heavily toward  some goal, doggedly intent upon his own business.    Outside Starfish Shoal the girl eased the sheet as the wind freshened.  Far away on Golden Bar thousands of wild geese, which had been tipping  their sterns"]]]
