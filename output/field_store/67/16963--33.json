Mr. Cave's statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely  circumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional quality  that taints hallucinatory impressions. But it must be remembered that  all the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint  opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would.  The difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men  was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr.  Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.    The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive  plain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable  height, as if from a tower or a mast. To the east and to the west the  plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which  reminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what the picture  was Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain. These cliffs passed north and  south--he could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were  visible of a night--receding in an almost illimitable perspective and  fading into the mists of the distance before they met. He was nearer the  eastern set of cliffs, on the occasion of his first vision the sun was  rising over them, and black against the sunlight and pale against their  shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as  birds. A vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed to be  looking down upon them; and, as they approached the blurred and  refracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct. There were also  trees curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep mossy green and an  exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal. And something great and  brilliantly coloured flew across the picture. But the first time Mr.  Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his hands shook, his  head moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and indistinct. And  at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again  once the direction of it was lost.    His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the  interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful  experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. The view  was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent  observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding this strange  world from exactly the same spot, although he was looking in a different  direction. The long facade of the great building, whose roof he had  looked down upon before, was now receding in perspective. He recognised  the roof. In the front of the facade was a terrace of massive  proportions and extraordinary length, and down the middle of the  terrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very graceful masts,  bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun. The import  of these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave until some time after,  as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace. The terrace overhung a  thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation, and beyond this  was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures, in form like  beetles but enormously larger, reposed. Beyond this again was a richly  decorated causeway of pinkish stone; and beyond that, and lined with  dense _red_ weeds, and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the  distant cliffs, was a broad and mirror-like expanse of water. The air  seemed full of squadrons of great birds, man{oe}uvring in stately  curves; and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings,  richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets, among a  forest of moss-like and lichenous trees. And suddenly something flapped  repeatedly across the vision, like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or  the beating of a wing, and a face, or rather the upper part of a face  with very large eyes, came as it were close to his own and as if on the  other side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was so startled and so impressed by  the absolute reality of these eyes, that he drew his head back from the  crystal to look behind it. He had become so absorbed in watching that he  was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little  shop, with its familiar odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay. And, as  he blinked about him, the glowing crystal faded, and went out.    Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story is  curiously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the valley  first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely  affected, and, as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he  saw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion. He went about his  business listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he  should be able to return to his watching. And then a few weeks after his  first sight of the valley came the two customers, the stress and  excitement of their offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal from  sale, as I have already told.    Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave's secret, it remained a mere wonder, a  thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a  forbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator,  a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind. Directly the crystal  and its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the  phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain  evidence for Mr. Cave's statements, he proceeded to develop the matter  systematically. Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes  on this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from half-past eight  until half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace's absence, during the  day. On Sunday afternoons, also, he came. From the outset Mr. Wace made  copious notes, and it was due to his scientific method that the relation  between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal  and the orientation of the picture were proved. And, by covering the  crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the  exciting ray, and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he  greatly improved the conditions of the observations; so that in a little  while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired.    So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary  world within the crystal. The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave,  and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal  and report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had  learnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his  report. When the crystal faded, it was put into its box in the proper  position and the electric light turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and  suggested observations to clear up difficult points. Nothing, indeed,  could have been less visionary and more matter-of-fact.    The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like  creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier  visions. His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for  a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat. Then he  thought, grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs. Their heads  were round, and curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them that  had so startled him on his second observation. They had broad, silvery  wings, not feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed  fish and with the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not  built on the plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported  by curved ribs radiating from the body. (A sort of butterfly wing with  curved ribs seems best to express their appearance.) The body was small,  but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs, like long tentacles,  immediately under the mouth. Incredible as it appeared to Mr. Wace, the  persuasion at last became irresistible, that it was these creatures  which owned the great quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden  that made the broad valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave perceived that the  buildings, with other peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great  circular windows, which opened freely, gave the creatures egress and  entrance. They would alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a  smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior. But among them was  a multitude of smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and  moths and flying beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured  gigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the  causeways and terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater  winged flies, but wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their  hand-like tangle of tentacles.    Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that  stood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned upon Mr. Cave,  after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly  vivid day, that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like  that into which he peered. And a still more careful scrutiny convinced  him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object.    Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one,  and, folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the  mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,--sometimes for as  long as fifteen minutes. And a series of observations, made at the  suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this  visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered  actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace, and  that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other  world had looked into Mr. Cave's face while he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#3)"],[1,"something detached from all other bodies, and  poised without visible support in space. When this discovery was first  announced it must have appeared a very startling truth. It was so  difficult to realise that the solid earth on which we stand reposed on  nothing! What was to keep it from falling? How could it be sustained  without tangible support, like the legendary coffin of Mahomet? But  difficult as it may have been to receive this doctrine, yet its  necessary truth in due time commanded assent, and the science of  Astronomy began to exist. The changes of the seasons and the recurrence  of seed-time and harvest must, from the earliest times, have been  associated with certain changes in the position of the sun. In the  summer at mid-day the sun rises high in the heavens, in the winter it is  always low. Our luminary, therefore, performs an annual movement up and  down in the heavens, as well as a diurnal movement of rising and  setting. But there is a third species of change in the sun's position,  which is not quite so obvious, though it is still capable of being  detected by a few careful observations, if combined with a philosophical  habit of reflection. The very earliest observers of the stars can hardly  have failed to notice that the constellations visible at night varied  with the season of the year. For instance, the brilliant figure of  Orion, though so well seen on winter nights, is absent from the summer  skies, and the place it occupied is then taken by quite different groups  of stars. The same may be said of other constellations. Each season of  the year can thus be characterised by the sidereal objects that are  conspicuous by night. Indeed, in ancient days, the time for commencing  the cycle of agricultural occupations was sometimes indicated by the  position of the constellations in the evening.    By reflecting on these facts the early astronomers were enabled to  demonstrate the apparent annual movement of the sun. There could be no  rational explanation of the changes in the constellations with the  seasons, except by supposing that the place of the sun was altering, so  as to make a complete circuit of the heavens in the course of the year.  This movement of the sun is otherwise confirmed by looking at the west  after sunset, and watching the stars. As the season progresses, it may  be noticed each evening that the constellations seem to sink lower and  lower towards the west, until at length they become invisible from the  brightness of the sky. The disappearance is explained by the supposition  that the sun appears to be continually ascending from the west to meet  the stars. This motion is, of course, not to be confounded with the  ordinary diurnal rising and setting, in which all the heavenly bodies  participate. It is to be understood that besides being affected by the  common motion our luminary has a slow independent movement in the  opposite direction; so that though the sun and a star may set at the  same time to-day, yet since by to-morrow the sun will have moved a  little towards the east, it follows that the star must then set a few  minutes before the sun.[1]    The patient observations of the early astronomers enabled the sun's  track through the heavens to be ascertained, and it was found that in  its circuit amid the stars and constellations our luminary invariably  followed the same path. This is called the _ecliptic_, and the  constellations through which it passes form a belt around the heavens  known as the _zodiac_. It was anciently divided into twelve equal  portions or \"signs,\" so that the stages on the sun's great journey could  be conveniently indicated. The duration of the year, or the period  required by the sun to run its course around the heavens, seems to have  been first ascertained by astronomers whose names are unknown. The skill  of the early Oriental geometers was further evidenced by their  determination of the position of the ecliptic with regard to the  celestial equator, and by their success in the measurement of the angle  between these two important circles on the heavens.    The principal features of the motion of the moon have also been noticed  with intelligence at an antiquity more remote than history. The  attentive observer perceives the important truth that the moon does not  occupy a fixed position in the heavens. During the course of a single  night the fact that the moon has moved from west to east across the  heavens can be perceived by noting its position relatively to adjacent  stars. It is indeed probable that the motion of the moon was a discovery  prior to that of the annual motion of the sun, inasmuch as it is the  immediate consequence of a simple observation, and involves but little  exercise of any intellectual power. In prehistoric times also, the time  of revolution of the moon had been ascertained, and the phases of our  satellite had been correctly attributed to the varying aspect under  which the sun-illuminated side is turned towards the earth.    But we are far from having exhausted the list of great discoveries which  have come down from unknown antiquity. Correct explanations had been  given of the striking phenomenon of a lunar eclipse, in which the  brilliant surface is plunged temporarily into darkness, and also of the  still more imposing spectacle of a solar eclipse, in which the sun  itself undergoes a partial or even a total obscuration. Then, too, the  acuteness of the early astronomers had detected the five wandering stars  or planets: they had traced the movements of Mercury and Venus, Mars,  Jupiter, and Saturn. They had observed with awe the various  configurations of these planets: and just as the sun, and in a lesser  degree the moon, were intimately associated with the affairs of daily  life, so in the imagination of these early investigators the movements  of the planets were thought to be pregnant with human weal or human woe.  At length a certain order was perceived to govern the apparently  capricious movements of the planets. It was found that they obeyed  certain laws. The cultivation of the science of geometry went hand in  hand with the study of astronomy: and as we emerge from the dim  prehistoric ages into the historical period, we find that the theory of  the phenomena of the heavens possessed already some degree of coherence.    Ptolemy, following Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, acknowledged that  the earth's figure was globular, and he demonstrated it by the same  arguments that we employ at the present day. He also discerned how this  mighty globe was isolated in space. He admitted that the diurnal  movement of the heavens could be accounted for by the revolution of the  earth upon its axis, but unfortunately he assigned reasons for the  deliberate rejection of this view. The earth, according to him, was a  fixed body; it possessed neither rotation round an axis nor translation  through space, but remained constantly at rest in what he supposed to be  the centre of the universe. According to Ptolemy's theory the sun and  the moon moved in circular orbits around the earth in the centre. The  explanation of the movements of the planets he found to be more  complicated, because it was necessary to account for the fact that a  planet sometimes advanced and that it sometimes retrograded. The ancient  geometers refused to believe that any movement, except revolution in a  circle, was possible for a celestial body: accordingly a contrivance was  devised by which each planet was supposed to revolve in a circle, of  which the centre described another circle around the earth.    Although the Ptolemaic doctrine is now known to be framed on quite an  extravagant estimate of the importance of the earth in the scheme of the  heavens, yet it must be admitted that the apparent movements of the  celestial bodies can be thus accounted for with considerable accuracy.  This theory is described in the great work known as the \"Almagest,\"  which was written in the second century of our era, and was regarded for  fourteen centuries as the final authority on all questions of astronomy.    Such was the system of Astronomy which prevailed during the Middle Ages,  and was only discredited at an epoch nearly simultaneous with that of  the discovery of the New World by Columbus. The true arrangement of the  solar system was then expounded by Copernicus in the great work to which  he devoted his life. The first principle established by these labours  showed the diurnal movement of the heavens to be due to the rotation of  the earth on its axis. Copernicus pointed out the fundamental difference  between real motions and apparent motions; he proved that the  appearances presented in the daily rising and setting of the sun and the  stars could be accounted for by the supposition that the earth rotated,  just as satisfactorily as by the more cumbrous supposition of Ptolemy.  He showed, moreover, that the latter supposition must attribute an  almost infinite velocity to the stars, so that the rotation of the  entire universe around the earth was clearly a preposterous supposition.  The second great principle, which has conferred immortal glory on  Copernicus, assigned to the earth its true position in the universe.  Copernicus transferred the centre, about which all the planets revolve,  from the earth to the sun; and he established the somewhat humiliating  truth, that our earth is merely a planet pursuing a track between the  paths of Venus and of Mars, and subordinated like all the other planets  to the supreme sway of the Sun.    This great revolution swept from astronomy those distorted views of the  earth's importance which arose, perhaps not unnaturally, from the fact  that we happen to be domiciled on that particular planet. The  achievements of Copernicus were soon to be followed by the invention of  the telescope, that wonderful instrument by which the modern science of  astronomy has been created. To "]]]
