THE FAIRIES DANCING          I heard along the early hills,      Ere yet the lark was risen up,      Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills      The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--      I heard the fairies in a ring      Sing as they tripped a lilting round      Soft as the moon on wavering wing.      The starlight shook as if with sound,      As if with echoing, and the stars      Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;      While red with war the gusty Mars      Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.      He shone alone, adown the West,      While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,      Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed      The fires of the morning flush.      Till, as a mist, their beauty died,      Their singing shrill and fainter grew;      And daylight tremulous and wide      Flooded the moorland through and through;      Till Urdon's copper weathercock      Was reared in golden flame afar,      And dim from moonlit dreams awoke      The towers and groves of Arroar.              REVERIE          When slim Sophia mounts her horse         And paces down the avenue,      It seems an inward melody           She paces to.        Each narrow hoof is lifted high        Beneath the dark enclust'ring pines,      A silver ray within his bit          And bridle shines.        His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,        And streams upon the shadowy air,      The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,          His mistress' hair.        Her habit flows in darkness down,        Upon the stirrup rests her foot,      Her brow is lifted, as if earth          She heeded not.        'Tis silent in the avenue,        The sombre pines are mute of song,      The blue is dark, there moves no breeze          The boughs among.        When slim Sophia mounts her horse        And paces down the avenue,      It seems an inward melody          She paces to.              THE THREE BEGGARS          'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,        While past St Ann's grey tower they shuffled,      Three beggars spied a fairy-child          In crimson mantle muffled.        The daybreak lighted up her face        All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;      She looked on them a little space,          And shrill as hautboy cried:--        'O three tall footsore men of rags        Which walking this gold morn I see,      What will ye give me from your bags          For fairy kisses three?'        The first, that was a reddish man,        Out of his bundle takes a crust:      'La, by the tombstones of St Ann,          There's fee, if fee ye must!'        The second, that was a chesnut man,        Out of his bundle draws a bone:      'La, by the belfry of St Ann,          And all my breakfast gone!'        The third, that was a yellow man,        Out of his bundle picks a groat,      'La, by the Angel of St Ann,          And I must go without.'        That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,        Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!      Beneath her finger taper-tipped          The magic all ran through.        Instead of crust a peacock pie,        Instead of bone sweet venison,      Instead of groat a white lilie          With seven blooms thereon.        And each fair cup was deep with wine:        Such was the changeling's charity,      The sweet feast was enough for nine,          But not too much for three.        O toothsome meat in jelly froze!        O tender haunch of elfin stag!      O rich the odour that arose!          O plump with scraps each bag!        There, in the daybreak gold and wild,        Each merry-hearted beggar man      Drank deep unto the fairy child,          And blessed the good St Ann.              THE DWARF          'Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,          That lives in Barberry Wood,      And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--        He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,          He hates little girls that are rude.'        Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,          And the dwarf looked over the wall,      He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could        To keep from laughing at all, at all,          To keep from laughing at all.        His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,          And when he opened the door,      He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could        To keep from laughing the more, the more,          To keep from laughing the more.        As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,          Pricked out to double its size,      He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could        To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,          To keep the tears out of her eyes.        He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,          But while in the porch she bides,      He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could        To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,          To keep from cracking her sides.        He threw a pumpkin over the wall,          And melons and apples beside,      So thick in the air, that to see 'em all fall,        She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried,          Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.        Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,          And red as a rose she grew;--      'Kah! kah!' said the dwarf, 'is it crying you're at?        It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,          It's the very worst thing you could do.'        He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,          He shook her down cherries like rain;      'See now,' says he, cheeping, 'a blackbird I be,        Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again-gain-gain,          Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again.'        Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet          From a house i' the deeps of a wood!      Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet        A-laughing as loud as they could-could-could,          A-laughing as loud as they could.        Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,          There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,      Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;        La! who can draw tears from a well-well-well,          Who ever drew tears from a well!              ALULVAN          The sun is clear of bird and cloud,      The grass shines windless, grey, and still,      In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,      The cuckoo echoes on the hill;        Yet soft along Alulvan's walks          The ghost at noonday stalks.        His eyes in shadow of his hat      Stare on the ruins of his house;      His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,      Of faded velvet grey as mouse,        Brushes the roses as he goes:          Yet wavers not one rose.        The wild birds in a cloud fly up      From their sweet feeding in the fruit;      The droning of the bees and flies      Rises gradual as a lute;        Is it for fear the birds are flown,          And shrills the insect-drone?        Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,      And crisp with summer-heat its turf;      Far, far across its empty pastures      Alulvan's sands are white with surf:        And he himself is grey as sea,          Watching beneath an elder-tree.        All night the fretful, shrill Banshee      Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,      Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,      Through magpie changing of the moons:        'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,          The doom of lone Alulvan!'              THE PEDLAR          There came a Pedlar to an evening house;      Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,      Wondered what man he was, so curious      His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:      Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--      'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,      And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,      Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,      To keep in water for to make night sweet:      All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'        Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her      The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--      'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer      Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys      And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;      Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,      Confuse his magic who is all mockery:      His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long      But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,      And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!        'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,      'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,      One lock of hair is gold enough for me,      For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'      But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,      'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'      And many another woodland tongue beside      Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'      Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,      'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'        A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,      As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;      Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--      'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?      Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,      Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,      A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,      A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:      Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,      'I pass not often such a lonely place.'        'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,      'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,      Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:      Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'      There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;      'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;      And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food      All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--      And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--      'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'        O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!      Now only night is where the Pedlar was;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23569"],[0,"Christmas Holidays at Merryvale (#3)"],[1," proved to be a little fellow,  deep in a snow drift. His hands were blue with the cold and as Father  Brown picked him up in his arms he tried to speak, but couldn't.    \"I know who he is,\" volunteered Herbie. \"He's Patsy O'Reilly, and he  lives over there,\" pointing to a small house up the road. \"His brother  Mike goes to school with me,\" he continued.    \"I'll carry him home,\" said Father, \"as you boys are able to handle  things all right now,\" saying which, he started off to the little house  with Patsy in his arms.    Chuck, to whom Father Brown had handed the reins now started to drive  the horse toward home.    When the boys arrived at the church and had carried in the greens, the  ladies were delighted, and one of them even tried to kiss Reddy, but he  hurried away just in time.          CHAPTER VI    TOAD'S UNSELFISHNESS      When they reached home Chuck drove the sleigh up to the side door, where  the boys quickly unloaded the greens. They then lifted the tree to the  piazza and when this had been done Chuck drove the horse to the stable.    \"Let's go in and get our hands warm before we take in the greens,\"  suggested Toad, and soon they were all laughing and talking before the  great fire in the library.    Fat had just asked the others if they remembered the day Mr. Brown had  told them about the Indians that used to live in the woods where they  found the tree, when a man's voice was heard from the hall.    \"It's going to be a sad Christmas for them, I'm afraid, for both parents  are ill and the three helpless children are waiting for Santa Claus to  come,\" the boys heard Father Brown say.    \"How sad,\" was Mrs. Brown's answer, as they both went into the kitchen  and the boys could hear no more.    \"They must be talking about the O'Reillys,\" commented Fat. \"Mike's a  friend of mine and I'm sorry he isn't going to have any Christmas.\"    \"So am I,\" echoed Herbie, after a short silence.    Chuck said he'd hate to awaken Christmas morning and not find any  presents.    \"Guess I've been mighty selfish wanting so many things,\" he thought.    Toad and Reddy, who had moved away from the other boys, were talking  together in low, excited whispers. Then, when the others went to the  window to look at the green outside, they slipped from the room and  hurried down the hall to the kitchen.    \"Mother,\" called Toad from the doorway, \"may we speak to you for a  minute?\"    Mother Brown handed the bowl in which she had been stirring something  to the cook and crossed the room toward the boys, saying as she did so:    \"I can only spare a few minutes to-day, Thomas, for I am very busy.\"    \"But, Mother,\" exclaimed Toad, \"we have a great idea!\"    \"It's a Christmas surprise party,\" chimed in Reddy, \"for the O'Reillys,\"  and together the two boys went on to tell Mrs. Brown of their plans.    \"If we could just have the horse and sleigh to get around in,\" ventured  Toad. \"Do you think Father would allow us to hitch old Meg to the big  sleigh?\"    \"It's a wonderful idea,\" agreed Mother Brown. \"Suppose you ask him. But  how about presents for the three children? Have you thought of that?\"    \"If it were only after Christmas we could give away some of our new  things,\" sighed Toad.    \"But would you give them away?\" asked his mother. \"Supposing you were  going to get a sled,--the kind you have been wanting,\" and she paused to  hear Toad's answer.    He thought very hard for a moment, then answered:    \"Yes, because I always get a lot of things and it might be the only  present Mike would get.\"    \"Well,\" remarked his mother, \"I have bought you a sled, and you may give  it to him.\"    Reddy looked at Toad, as Mother Brown turned toward the kitchen.    \"Are you sorry now that you said 'yes'?\" he asked.    \"No, I'm not,\" returned Toad.    \"Well, I'll ask Mother to let me give them something new of mine, too,\"  declared Reddy consolingly, putting his arm about Toad's shoulder.          CHAPTER VII    THE BOYS PLAN A SURPRISE      At two o'clock the sleigh was ready, for Father Brown had willingly  given the boys permission to use it that afternoon. It was planned to  have Chuck drive, for Toad, Reddy, Fat and Herbie expected to be too  busy calling at the different houses to gather the presents which they  hoped to collect for the O'Reillys.    \"Let's stop at Bailey's first,\" suggested Fat, \"as we're sure to get  something there.\"    \"Who'll go to the door?\" questioned Herbie.    \"All go,\" answered Chuck. \"That's the best way.\" So in a group they rang  the bell and waited, Chuck remaining in the sleigh.    No one came in answer to their ring.    \"All out,\" sighed Fat; but Toad gave the bell another pull.    \"Bet they're all in the kitchen baking things and didn't hear it,\" he  remarked.    \"There's someone coming now,\" whispered Reddy, and as the door opened:    \"Good afternoon,\" said all the boys in chorus.    \"Mercy upon us, where did you all come from?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bailey,  and, as Toad held forth a card that Father Brown had printed for them,  she asked:    \"Am I to read this?\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Bailey, that explains everything,\" Reddy told her.    She read:--            \"In one little home there may be no Christmas          cheer; the father and mother are both ill.          There are three children; a boy of nine years,          another of five, and a girl of seven. They need          coal, clothing, food and toys. _What will you          give?_\"    \"So you're all playing at being Santa Claus,\" remarked Mrs. Bailey with  a smile. \"Well, I believe I can find something that will please you, so  just stop in on your way back and I'll have it all ready for you.\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" cried all the boys, together, as they started for the  sleigh, happy over the success of their first call.    \"Have any luck?\" asked Chuck. \"But I can see you did, because you're all  grinning,\" he added, as they told him what Mrs. Bailey had promised.    After several more visits, with the promise of something from each place  if they would call later, Herbie proposed that they stop at Mrs. Lee's  home, as Mary Lee had a great many dolls and might give them one of them  for the little O'Reilly girl.    \"That's a good idea,\" they all agreed, and the idea was carried out.    When Mrs. Lee had read the card she asked the boys if there was anything  they needed that had not been promised.    \"We wondered,\" replied Herbie, \"if Mary would give us a doll for that  little girl?\"    Mrs. Lee smiled and said:    \"I think I can promise you that she will. If you will call later it will  give me a chance to get her.\"    \"We'll be glad to,\" promised the boys, \"and thank you.\"    At five o'clock a sleigh piled high with bundles and boys was seen  turning into the Brown's driveway.    \"What'll we do now?\" asked Toad of the others.    [Illustration: Framed in the doorway stood a boy gazing at a heap of  bundles.]    \"Let's drive into the barn and leave the things in the sleigh,\"  suggested Chuck; \"then we can meet here early tonight and take the  things to the O'Reillys.\"    \"All right,\" assented the others. \"What time shall we meet?\"    \"At seven o'clock,\" said Toad.          CHAPTER VIII    WHAT MIKE FOUND      After dinner that night Chuck and Toad spent a little time helping to  trim the big tree that had been put in place in the library during their  absence of the afternoon. Chuck was on the top of a stepladder, tying  shiny colored balls to the upper branches, when Toad, who had been busy  with candy canes and popcorn balls, suddenly stopped and looked at the  clock on the mantel.    \"It's seven o'clock, Chuck,\" he cried, \"and the others will be  wondering why we don't come out,\" and at this he ran into the hall to  get into his coat and cap.    Chuck took but a second to follow Toad out into the yard to meet the  boys.    Mother Brown had sent her bundle and Toad's new sled to the barn by  John, the stableman, who put them into the sleigh with the other things  while the boys were at dinner.    \"Hello, boys! Everybody here?\" inquired Toad as he joined the group of  boys in front of the barn.    \"All but Fat,\" laughed Reddy, \"and he'll be along in a minute. He said I  walked too fast for him.\"    \"Is everything in the sleigh?\" asked Herbie, as John was hitching up.    \"Everything's in all right,\" Toad assured him.    When about to start they found that the sleigh was so full of bundles  that some of the boys had to stand on the runners. Just as they reached  the street, Fat was seen coming toward them.    \"Hurry up, lazy bones,\" called Reddy, \"or you'll get left,\" but John  good-naturedly stopped the horse until Fat had climbed aboard.    There was a full moon and the sky was bright with stars. The snow was  hard beneath the horse's feet, which made the going easy, so they  traveled along at a brisk pace.    \"Where shall I stop?\" asked John as they drew near the O'Reilly's  cottage.    \"Just a little this side of the house,\" directed Toad, \"so they won't  hear us.\"    \"All off, now,\" ordered Reddy, as John pulled up the horse, \"and help  unload. Don't let's make any more noise than we can help.\"    \"We can pile everything on the front steps,\" whispered Herbie, as the  boys, each heavily laden with packages of all sizes and shapes, walked  very quietly up the path toward the house.    Each carefully placed his bundles or boxes where Herbie had suggested  and just as silently they now returned to the sleigh.    \"Suppose someone comes along and takes all the things before they get up  in the morning?\" argued Fat. \"I don't think it's safe to leave them  there all night, do you?\"    \"Well, maybe we'd better throw some snowballs at the door,\" proposed  Chuck, \"to bring them out now.\"    This was accepted as a good plan, and \"Bang, bang, bang!\" went the balls  against the door.    The sleigh, in which the boys took refuge, was well hidden behind a pine  tree, so they could not be seen from the house.    \"There's a light!\" said Reddy in a low voice. \"Someone"]]]
