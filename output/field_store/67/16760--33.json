Chop a small onion or shalot fine, and boil it in a pint of milk for  five minutes; then add about ten ounces of crumb of bread, a bit of  butter, pepper and salt to season; stir the whole on the fire for ten  minutes, and eat this bread sauce with roast fowl or turkey.      No. 19. EGG SAUCE FOR ROAST FOWLS, ETC.    Boil two or three eggs for about eight minutes; remove the shells, cut  up each egg into about ten pieces of equal size, and put them into some  butter-sauce made as follows:--viz., Knead two ounces of flour with one  ounce and-a-half of butter; add half-a-pint of water, pepper and salt to  season, and stir the sauce on the fire until it begins to boil; then mix  in the pieces of chopped hard-boiled eggs.      No. 20. PORK CHOPS, GRILLED OR BROILED.    Score the rind of each chop by cutting through the rind at distances of  half-an-inch apart; season the chops with pepper and salt, and place  them on a clean gridiron over a clear fire to broil; the chops must be  turned over every two minutes until they are done; this will take about  fifteen minutes. The chops are then to be eaten plain, or, if  convenient, with brown gravy, made as shown in No. 17.      No. 21. SHARP SAUCE FOR BROILED MEATS.    Chop fine an onion and a pennyworth of mixed pickles; put these into a  saucepan with half-a-gill of vinegar, a tea-spoonful of mustard, a small  bit of butter, a large table-spoonful of bread-raspings, and pepper and  salt to season; boil all together on the fire for at least six minutes;  then add a gill of water, and allow the sauce to boil again for ten  minutes longer. This sauce will give an appetizing relish to the  coarsest meats or fish when broiled or fried, and also when you are  intending to make any cold meat into a hash or stew. In the latter case,  the quantity of water and raspings must be doubled.      No. 22. ROAST VEAL, STUFFED.    A piece of the shoulder, breast, or chump-end of the loin of veal, is  the cheapest part for you, and whichever of these pieces you may happen  to buy, should be seasoned with the following stuffing:--To eight ounces  of bruised crumb of bread add four ounces of chopped suet, shalot,  thyme, marjoram, and winter savory, all chopped fine; two eggs, pepper  and salt to season; mix all these ingredients into a firm compact kind  of paste, and use this stuffing to fill a hole or pocket which you will  have cut with a knife in some part of the piece of veal, taking care to  fasten it in with a skewer. If you intend roasting the veal, and should  not possess what is called a bottle-jack, nor even a Dutch oven, in that  case the veal should be suspended by, and fastened to, the end of a  twisted skein of worsted, made fast at the upper end by tying it to a  large nail driven into the centre of the mantelpiece for that purpose.  This contrivance will enable you to roast the veal by dangling it before  your fire; the exact time for cooking it must depend upon its weight. A  piece of veal weighing four pounds would require rather more than an  hour to cook it thoroughly before your small fire.      No. 23. VEAL CUTLETS AND BACON.    You may sometimes have a chance to purchase a few trimmings or cuttings  of veal, or a small piece from the chump end of the loin, which you can  cut up in thin slices, and after seasoning them with pepper and salt,  and rolling them in flour, they are to be fried in the fat that remains  from some slices of bacon which you shall have previously fried; and,  after placing the fried veal and bacon in its dish, shake a  table-spoonful of flour in the frying-pan; add a few drops of ketchup or  vinegar and a gill of water; stir all together on the fire to boil for  five minutes, and pour this sauce over the cutlets. A dish of cutlets of  any kind of meat may be prepared as above.      No. 24. A PUDDING MADE OF SMALL BIRDS.    Industrious and intelligent boys who live in the country, are mostly  well up in the cunning art of catching small birds at odd times during  the winter months. So, my young friends, when you have been so fortunate  as to succeed in making a good catch of a couple of dozen of birds, you  must first pluck them free from feathers, cut off their heads and claws,  and pick out their gizzards from their sides with the point of a small  knife, and then hand the birds over to your mother, who, by following  these instructions, will prepare a famous pudding for your dinner or  supper. First, fry the birds whole with a little butter, shalot,  parsley, thyme, and winter savory, all chopped small, pepper and salt to  season; and when the birds are half done, shake in a small handful of  flour, add rather better than a gill of water, stir the whole on the  fire while boiling for ten minutes, and when the stew of birds is nearly  cold, pour it all into a good-sized pudding basin, which has been  ready-lined with either a suet and flour crust, or else a  dripping-crust, cover the pudding in with a piece of the paste, and  either bake or boil it for about an hour and-a-half.      No. 25. BAKED PIG'S HEAD.    Split the pig's head into halves, sprinkle them with pepper and salt,  and lay them with the rind part uppermost upon a bed of sliced onions in  a baking dish. Next bruise eight ounces of stale bread-crumb, and mix it  with four ounces of chopped suet, twelve sage leaves chopped fine,  pepper and salt to season, and sprinkle this seasoning all over the  surface of the pig's head; add one ounce of butter and a gill of vinegar  to the onions, and bake the whole for about an hour and-a-half, basting  the pig's head occasionally with the liquor.      No. 26. BAKED GOOSE.    Pluck and pick out all the stubble feathers thoroughly clean, draw the  goose, cut off the head and neck, and also the feet and wings, which  must be scalded to enable you to remove the pinion feathers from the  wings and the rough skin from the feet; split and scrape the inside of  the gizzard, and carefully cut out the gall from the liver. These  giblets well stewed, as shown in No. 62, will serve to make a pie for  another day's dinner. Next stuff the goose in manner following,  viz.:--First put six potatoes to bake in the oven, or even in a Dutch  oven; and, while they are being baked, chop six onions with four apples  and twelve sage leaves, and fry these in a saucepan with two ounces of  butter, pepper and salt; when the whole is slightly fried, mix it with  the pulp of the six baked potatoes, and use this very nice stuffing to  fill the inside of the goose. The goose being stuffed, place it upon an  iron trivet in a baking dish containing peeled potatoes and a few  apples; add half-a-pint of water, pepper and salt, shake some flour over  the goose, and bake it for about an hour and a-half.      No. 27. BAKED SUCKING PIG.    Let the pig be stuffed in the same manner as directed for a goose, as  shown in the preceding Number; score it all over crosswise, rub some  grease or butter upon it, place it upon a trivet in a dish containing  peeled potatoes and a few sliced onions, season with pepper and salt;  add half-a-pint of water, and bake the pig for about two hours, basting  it frequently with its own dripping, or, a bit of butter tied up in a  piece of muslin.      No. 28. BAKED OR ROAST DUCKS.    These are to be dressed in the same way as directed for dressing geese.      No. 29. HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF A PIG, AFTER IT IS KILLED.    Cottagers sometimes feed a pig for their own consumption, and,  therefore, in the hope that many of you may have it in your power to do  so, I will give you proper instructions as to the best way to make the  most of it. First, when the pig is killed, should the hair or bristles  be wet, wipe them dry with a wisp of hay or straw, and having laid it on  the ground upon a narrow bed of dry straw three inches in thickness, and  laid some loose straw all over it, set fire to it, and as the upper  straw burns out, lay on another covering of loose straw, and, by the  time this has burnt out, all the hairs of the upper part of the pig will  probably be singed off, if not, burn a little more straw upon the  remaining parts; and, on turning the pig over, should it be found that  any of the hairs yet remain, let them be singed off with a lighted wisp  of straw. Throw a pail of water over the pig, and scrape it clean and  dry with an old knife. The next thing to be done, is to insert a stout  stick, pointed at the ends, into the hocks of the hind legs; fasten a  strong cord to the stick, and hoist up the pig so as to enable you to  stand up and finish your work with ease to yourself. With a sharp knife  rip up the belly, and stretch out the flaps with two sticks to enable  you to throw in some water to cleanse the pig's inside, having first  removed the guts, etc.; hang up the pluck to cool, and also the  chitterlings, and loose fat; and, after thoroughly wiping the pig, let  it hang in the draught to become quite cold. You then split the pig in  halves, commencing between the hind quarters; and, when this is done,  first cut off the hocks, then the hams, and the head; next cleverly  remove, slicing away, what is called the spare-rib--that is, the lean  meat about the ribs--reaching up about four inches toward the breast  part, and lay the spare-ribs aside to be sold or reserved for your own  use. The head may be baked as shown in No. 25. The spare-rib may be  dressed as in No. 27.      No. 30. HOW TO CURE HAMS.    To six pounds of common salt, add four ounces of saltpetre, eight ounces  of treacle, two ounces of salprunella, winter savory, bay-leaves, thyme,  marjoram, and a good table-spoonful of allspice, bruise all these things  well together, and thoroughly rub them over and into the hams, _with  very clean hands_. The rubbing-in must be repeated four or five  successive mornings, and the hams must remain in this pickle for ten  days longer.      No. 31. HOW TO"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#3)"],[1,"raciously, and putting on a modest air  replied: \"_Palatinski niet, paruski_ (I do not speak Latin, I speak only  Russian),\" and the more I repeated \"palatinski,\" putting the inflection  now on one syllable, then on the other, to make him understand, the more  flattered the man seemed to be, and modestly gave the same answer.    This was incomprehensible to me, until my polyglot fellow-passenger came  to my assistance.    \"Do you know what you are asking the guard?\" he said in convulsions of  laughter.    \"Yes, I am asking for a 'palatinski'--a towel.\"    \"No, you are not!\" and he positively went into hysterics. \"Palatinski  means 'Do you speak Latin?' How can you expect a Russian railway-guard to  speak Latin? Look how incensed the poor man is at being mistaken for a  Latin scholar! Ask him for a _palatiensi_, and he will run for a towel.\"    The man did run on the magic word being pronounced, and duly returned  with a nice clean _palatiensi_, which, however, was little use to me for  I had by this time nearly got dry by the natural processes of dripping  and evaporation.    One or two other similar incidents, and the extreme civility one meets  from every one while travelling in Russia, passed the time away  pleasantly until Kiev, one of the oldest cities of Russia, was reached.          CHAPTER II         Kiev--Its protecting Saint--Intellectuality and trade--Priests       and education--Wherein lies the strength of Russia--Industries--A       famous Monastery--The Catacombs of St. Theodosius and St.       Anthony--Pilgrims--Veneration of Saints--The Dnieper       river--Churches--A luminous cross--Kharkoff--Agriculture--Horse       fairs--Rostoff--Votka drunkenness--Strong fortifications--Cheap       and good travelling--Baku.      Tradition tells us that Kiev was founded before the Christian era, and  its vicissitudes have since been many and varied. It has at all times  been considered one of the most important ecclesiastical centres of  Russia,--if not indeed the most important--but particularly since St.  Vladimir, the protecting saint of the city, preached Christianity there  in 988, this being the first time that the religion of Christ had been  expounded in Russia. A century and a half before that time (in 822) Kiev  was the capital city of the state and remained such till 1169. In 1240 it  was captured by Mongols who held it for 81 years. The Lithuanians came  next, and remained in possession for 249 years, until 1569; then Poland  possessed it until the year 1654, when it became part of the Russian  Empire.    Kiev has the name of being a very intellectual city. Somehow or other,  intellectuality and trade do not seem to go together, and although the  place boasts of a military school and arsenal, theological colleges, a  university, a school of sacred picture painters, and a great many  scientific and learned societies, we find that none of these are locally  put to any marked practical use, except the sacred-picture painting; the  images being disposed of very rapidly, and for comparatively high prices  all over the country. Hardly any religious resorts are great commercial  centres, the people of these places being generally conservative and  bigoted and the ruling priestly classes devoting too much attention to  idealism to embark in commercial enterprise, which leaves little time for  praying. Agriculture and horticulture are encouraged and give good  results.    The priests make money--plenty of it--by their religion, and they  probably know that there is nothing more disastrous to religion in laymen  than rapid money-making by trade or otherwise. With money comes  education, and with education, too powerful a light thrown upon  superstition and idolatry. It is nevertheless possible, even probable,  that in the ignorance of the masses, in the fervent and unshaken  confidence which they possess in God, the Czar and their leaders, may yet  lie the greatest strength of Russia. It must not be forgotten that  half-educated, or half uneducated, masses are probably the weakness  to-day of most other civilised nations.    Some business on a small scale, however, is transacted at the various  fairs held in Kiev, such as the great fair at the beginning of the  Russian year. There are many beet-root sugar refineries, the staple  industry of the country, and next come leather tanneries, worked leather,  machinery, spirits, grain and tobacco. Wax candles are manufactured in  huge quantities, and in the monastery there is a very ancient  printing-press for religious books.    Peter the Great erected a fortress here in a most commanding spot. It is  said to contain up-to-date guns. A special pass has to be obtained from  the military authorities to be allowed to enter it, not so much because  it is used as an arsenal, but because from the high tower a most  excellent panoramic view is obtained of the city, the neighbourhood, and  the course of the river down below.    But Kiev is famous above all for its monastery, the Kievo-Petcherskaya,  near which the two catacombs of St. Theodosius and St. Antony attract  over three hundred thousand pilgrims every year. The first catacomb  contains forty-five bodies of saints, the other eighty and the revered  remains are stored in plain wood or silver-mounted coffins, duly labelled  with adequate inscriptions. The huge monastery itself bears the  appearance of great wealth, and has special accommodation for pilgrims.  As many as 200,000 pilgrims are said to receive board and lodging yearly  in the monastery. These are naturally pilgrims of the lower classes.    Enormous riches in solid gold, silver and jewellery are stored in the  monastery and are daily increased by devout gifts.    But let us visit the catacombs.    The spare-looking, long-haired and bearded priests at the entrance of the  catacomb present to each pilgrim, as a memento, a useful and much valued  wax candle, which one lights and carries in one's hand down the steep and  slippery steps of the subterranean passages. All along, the procession  halts before mummified and most unattractive bodies, a buzzing of prayers  being raised by the pilgrims when the identity of each saint is explained  by the priest conducting the party. The more devout people stoop over the  bodies and kiss them fervently all over, voluntarily and gladly  disbursing in return for the privilege all such small cash as may lie  idle in their pockets.    Down and down the crowd goes through the long winding, cold, damp,  rancid-smelling passages, devoid of the remotest gleam of ventilation,  and where one breathes air so thick and foul that it sticks to one's  clothes and furs one's tongue, throat and lungs for several hours after  one has emerged from the catacombs into fresh air again. Yet there are  hermit monks who spend their lives underground without ever coming up to  the light, and in doing so become bony, discoloured, ghastly creatures,  with staring, inspired eyes and hollow cheeks, half demented to all  appearance, but much revered and respected by the crowds for their  self-sacrifice.    Further on the pilgrims drink holy water out of a small cup made in the  shape of a cross, with which the liquid is served out from a larger  vessel. The expression of beatitude on their faces as they sip of the  holy water, and their amazing reverence for all they see and are told to  do, are quite extraordinary to watch, and are quite refreshing in these  dying days of idealism supplanted by fast-growing and less poetic  atheistic notions. The scowl I received from the priest when my turn came  and he lifted the tin cross to my lips, is still well impressed upon my  mind. I drew back and politely declined to drink. There was a murmur of  strong disapproval from all the people present, and the priest grumbled  something; but really, what with the fetid smell of tallow-candle smoke,  the used-up air, and the high scent of pilgrims--and religious people  ever have a pungent odour peculiar to themselves--water, whether holy or  otherwise, was about the very beverage that would have finished me up at  that particular moment.    Glad I was to be out in the open air again, driving through the pretty  gardens of Kiev, and to enjoy the extensive view from the high cliffs  overlooking the winding Dnieper River. A handsome suspension bridge joins  the two banks. The river is navigable and during the spring floods the  water has been known to rise as much as twenty feet.    The city of Kiev is situated on high undulating ground some 350 feet  above the river, and up to 1837 consisted of the old town, Podol and  Petchersk, to which forty-two years later were added Shulyavka,  Solomenka, Kurenevka and Lukyanovka, the city being divided into eight  districts. The more modern part of the town is very handsome, with wide  streets and fine stone houses of good architecture, whereas the poorer  abodes are mostly constructed of wood.    As in all the other cities of Russia there are in Kiev a great many  churches, over seventy in all, the oldest of which is the Cathedral of  St. Sophia in the centre of the town, built as early as 1037 on the spot  where the Petchenegs were defeated the previous year by Yarosloff. It is  renowned for its superb altar, its valuable mosaics and the tombs of  Russian grand-dukes. Next in importance is the Church of the Assumption,  containing the bodies of seven saints conveyed here from Constantinople.  At night the cross borne by the statue of Vladimir, erected on a high  point overlooking the Dnieper, is lighted up by electricity. This  luminous cross can be seen for miles and miles all over the country, and  the effect is most impressive and weird.    From Kiev I had to strike across country, and the trains were naturally  not quite so luxurious as the express trains on the main line, but still  the carriages were of the same type, extremely comfortable and spacious,  and all the trains corridor trains.
