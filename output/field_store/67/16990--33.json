Quackenbos, A.M., M.D., formerly of  Columbia University, essays the following definition of magnetism in his  excellent _Hypnotic Therapeutics_:         \"Magnetism is nothing more than earnestness and sincerity,       coupled with insight, sympathy, patience and tact. These       essentials cannot be bought and cannot be taught. They are       'born by nature,' they are dyed with 'the red ripe of the       heart.'\"    But Dr. Quackenbos is a physician and a philosopher. Had he been a  lexicographer he would have found the term magnetism far more inclusive.  He would at least have admitted the phenomenon which we have witnessed  so often when one possessed with volcanic vitality overwhelms a great  audience.    The old idea that magnetism is a kind of invisible form of intellectual  or psychic electricity has gone down the grotesque phrenological  vagaries of Gall as well as some of the pseudoscientific theories of  that very unusual man, Mesmer. We all possess what is known as  magnetism. Some have it in an unusual degree, as did Edwin Booth, Franz  Liszt, Phillips Brooks and Bismarck. It was surely neither the art nor  the ability of Daniel Webster that made his audiences accept some of his  fatuous platitudes as great utterances, nor was it the histrionic talent  alone of Richard Mansfield that enabled him to wring success from such  an obvious theatrical contraption as _Prince Karl_. Both Webster, with  his fathomless eyes and his ponderous voice, and Mansfield, with his  compelling personality, were exceptional examples of magnetism.      A NOTABLE EXAMPLE    Among virtuosos Paderewski is peculiarly forceful in the personal spell  he casts over his audience. Someone has said that it cost one hundred  thousand dollars to exploit his hair before he made his first American  tour. But it was by no means curiosity to see his hair which kept on  filling auditorium after auditorium. I attended his first concert in New  York, and was amazed to see a comparatively small gathering of musical  zealots. His command of the audience was at once imperial. The critics,  some of whom would have found Paderewski's hirsute crown a delightful  rack upon which to hang their ridicule, went into ecstasies instead. His  art and his striking personality, entirely apart from his appearance,  soon made him the greatest concert attraction in the musical world.  Anyone who has conversed with him for more than a few moments realizes  what the meaning of the word magnetism is. His entire bearing--his lofty  attitude of mind, his personal dignity all contribute to the  inexplicable attraction that the arch hypnotist Mesmer first described  as animal magnetism.    That magnetism of the pianist must be considered wholly apart from  personal beauty and great physical strength is obvious to anyone who has  given the subject a moment's thought. Many of the artists already  mentioned (in this book) who possess magnetism similar to that of  Paderewski could surely never make claim for personal beauty. Neither is  magnetism akin to that attraction we all experience when we see a  powerful, well-groomed horse, a sleek hound, a handsome tiger--that is,  it is not mere admiration for a beautiful animal. Whether it has any  similarity to the mysterious charm which makes the doomed bird lose  control of its wings upon the approach of a snake is difficult to  estimate. Certainly, in the paraphernalia of the modern recital with its  lowered lights and its solitary figure playing away at a polished  instrument one may find something of the physical apparatus employed by  the professional hypnotist to insure concentration--but even this can  not account for the pianist's real attractiveness. If Mr. Frohman's  \"vitality\" means the \"vital spark,\" the \"life element,\" it comes very  close to a true definition of magnetism, for success without this  precious Promethean force is inconceivable. It may be only a smouldering  ember in the soul of a dying Chopin, but if it is there it is  irresistible until it becomes extinct. Facial beauty and physical  prowess all made way for the kind of magnetism that Socrates, George  Sand, Julius Caesar, Henry VIII, Paganini, Emerson, Dean Swift or Richard  Wagner possessed.    More wonderful still is the fact that magnetism is by no means confined  to those who have finely trained intellects or who have achieved great  reputations. Some vaudeville buffoon or some gypsy fiddler may have  more attractive power than the virtuoso who had spent years in  developing his mind and his technic. The average virtuoso thinks far  more of his \"geist,\" his \"talent\" (or as Emerson would have it, \"the  shadow of the soul--the otherwise\") than he does of his technic, or his  cadenzas. By what mystic means magnetism may be developed, the writer  does not pretend to know. Possibly by placing one's deeper self (shall  we say \"subconscious self\") in closer communion with the great throbbing  problems of the invisible though perpetually evident forces of nature  which surround us we may become more alive, more sensitively vivified.  What would it mean to the young virtuoso if he could go to some occult  master, some seer of a higher thought, and acquire that lode-stone*  which has drawn fame and fortune to the blessed few? Hundreds have spent  fortunes upon charlatans in the attempt.    All artists know the part that the audience itself plays in falling  under the magnetic spell of the performer. Its connection with the  phenomena of autosuggestion is very clear. Dr. Wundt, the famous German  psychologist, showed a class of students how superstitions unconsciously  acquired in early life affect sensible adults who have long since passed  the stage at which they might put any credence in omens. At a concert  given by a famous player, the audience has been well schooled in  anticipation. The artist always appears under a halo his reputation has  made for him. This very reputation makes his conquest far easier than  that of the novice who has to prove his ability before he can win the  sympathy of the audience. He is far more likely to find the audience _en  rapport_ than indifferent. Sometime, at the play in a theater, watch how  the audience will unconsciously mirror the facial expressions of the  forceful actor. In some similar manner, the virtuoso on the concert  platform sensitizes the minds and emotions of the sympathetic audience.  If the effect is deep and lasting, the artist is said to possess that  Kohinoor of virtuosodom--magnetism.    Some widely read critics have made the very natural error of confounding  magnetism with personality. These words have quite different  connotations--personality comprehending the more subtle force of  magnetism. An artist's individual worth is very closely allied with his  personality--that is, his whole extrinsic attitude toward the thought  and action of the world about him. How important personality is may be  judged by the widely advertised efforts of the manufacturers of  piano-playing machines to convince the public that their products, often  astonishingly fine, do actually reproduce the individual effects which  come from the playing of the living artist. Piano-playing machines have  their place, and it is an important one. However, wonderful as they may  be, they can never be anything but machines. They bring unquestioned joy  to thousands, and they act as missionaries for both music and the  music-teacher by taking the art into countless homes where it might  otherwise never have penetrated, thus creating the foundation for a  strong desire for a thorough study of music. The piano-playing machine  may easily boast of a mechanism as wonderful as that of a Liszt, a  d'Albert or a Bachaus, but it can no more claim personality than the  typewriter upon which this article is being written can claim to  reproduce the individuality which characterizes the handwriting of  myriads of different persons. Personality, then, is the virtuoso's one  great unassailable stronghold. It is personality that makes us want to  hear a half dozen different renderings of a single Beethoven sonata by a  half dozen different pianists. Each has the charm and flavor of the  interpreter.    But personality in its relation to art has been so exquisitely defined  by the inimitable British essayist, A. C. Benson, that we can do no  better than to quote his words:    \"I have lately come to perceive that the one thing which gives value to  any piece of art, whether it be book, or picture, or music, is that  subtle and evasive thing which is called personality. No amount of  labor, of zest, even of accomplishment, can make up for the absence of  this quality. It must be an almost instinctive thing, I believe. Of  course, the mere presence of personality in a work of art is not  sufficient, because the personality revealed may be lacking in charm;  and charm, again, is an instinctive thing. No artist can set out to  capture charm; he will toil all the night and take nothing; but what  every artist can and must aim at is to have a perfectly sincere point of  view. He must take his chance as to whether his point of view is an  attractive one; but sincerity is the one indispensable thing. It is  useless to take opinions on trust, to retail them, to adopt them; they  must be formed, created, felt. The work of a sincere artist is almost  certain to have some value; the work of an insincere artist is of its  very nature worthless.\"    Mr. Benson's \"charm\" is what the virtuoso feels as magnetism. It puts  something into the artist's playing that he cannot define. For a moment  the vital spark flares into a bewildering flame, and all his world is  peopled with moths hovering around the \"divine fire.\"      THE GREATEST THING OF ALL    If we have dwelt too long upon magnetism, those who know its importance  in the artist's life will readily perceive the reason. But do not let us  be led away into thinking that magnetism can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#3)"],[1," raise money for soldier's  families, for tableaux, readings, theatricals, anything but  conventions to discuss principles and to circulate petitions for  emancipation. They could not see that the best service they could  render the army was to suppress the rebellion, and that the most  effective way to accomplish that was to transform the slaves into  soldiers. This Woman's Loyal League voiced the solemn lessons of the  war: liberty to all; national protection for every citizen under our  flag; universal suffrage, and universal amnesty.    As no national recognition has been accorded the grand women who did  faithful service in the late war; no national honors nor profitable  offices bestowed on them, the noble deeds of a few representative  women should be recorded. The military services of Anna Ella Carroll  in planning the campaign on the Tennessee; the labors of Clara Barton  on the battle-field; of Dorothea Dix in the hospital; of Dr. Elizabeth  Blackwell in the Sanitary; of Josephine S. Griffing in the Freedman's  Bureau; and the political triumphs of Anna Dickinson in the  Presidential campaign, reflecting as they do all honor on their sex in  general, should ever be proudly remembered by their countrywomen.      ANNA ELLA CARROLL.    THE TENNESSEE CAMPAIGN.    Anna Ella Carroll, the daughter of Thomas King Carroll formerly  Governor of Maryland, belongs to one of the oldest and most patriotic  families of that State. Her ancestors founded the city of Baltimore;  Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, one of the signers of the Declaration  of Independence, was of the same family.    At the breaking out of the civil war, Maryland was claimed by the  rebellious States, and for a long time her position seemed uncertain.  Miss Carroll, an intimate friend of Gov. Hicks, and at that time a  member of his family, favored the national cause, and by her powerful  arguments induced the Governor to remain firm in his opposition to the  scheme of secession. Thus, despite the siren wooing of the South, in  its plaint of      \"Maryland, my Maryland.\"    Miss Carroll was the means of preserving her native State to the  Union. Although a slave-owner, and a member of that class which so  largely proved disloyal, Miss Carroll freed her slaves, and devoted  herself throughout the war to the cause of liberty. She replied to the  secession speech of Senator Breckenridge, made during the July session  of Congress 1861, with such lucid and convincing arguments, that the  War Department not only circulated a large edition, but the Government  requested her to prepare other papers upon unsettled points. In  response she wrote a pamphlet entitled \"The War Powers of the  Government,\" published in December, 1861. By the especial request of  President Lincoln she also prepared a paper entitled \"The Relation of  Revolted Citizens to the National Government,\" which was approved by  him, and formed the basis of his subsequent action. In September,  1861, she also prepared a paper on the Constitutional power of the  President to make arrests, and to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_;  a subject upon which a great conflict of opinion then existed, even  among persons of unquestioned loyalty.    Early in the fall of 1861, Miss Carroll took a trip to St. Louis to  inspect the progress of the war in the West. A gun-boat fleet, under  the special authorization of the President, was then in preparation  for a descent of the Mississippi. An examination of this plan by Miss  Carroll showed its weakness, and the inevitable disaster it would  bring to the National arms. Her astute military genius led her to the  substitution of another plan, upon which she based great hopes of  success, and its results show it to have been one of the profoundest  strategic movements of the ages. Strategy and generalship are two  entirely distinct forms of the art of war. Many a general, good at  following out a plan, is entirely incapable of forming a successful  one. Napoleon stands in the foremost ranks as a strategist, and is  held as the greatest warrior of modern times, yet he led no forces  into battle. So entirely was he convinced that strategy was the whole  art of war, that he was accustomed to speak of himself as the only  general of his army, thus subordinating the mere command and movement  of forces to the art of strategy. Judged by this standard, which is  acknowledged by all military men, Anna Ella Carroll, of Maryland,  holds foremost rank as a military genius. On the 12th of November,  1861, while still in St. Louis, Miss Carroll wrote to Hon. Edward  Bates at Washington (the member of the Cabinet who first suggested the  expedition down the Mississippi), that from information gained by her  she believed this plan would fail, and urged him, instead, to have the  expedition directed up the Tennessee River, as the true line of  attack. She also dispatched a similar letter to Hon. Thomas A. Scott,  at that time Assistant Secretary of War. On the 30th of this month  (November, 1861), Miss Carroll laid the following plan, accompanied by  explanatory maps, before the War Department:         The civil and military authorities seem to me to be laboring       under a great mistake in regard to the true key of the war in the       South-west. It is not the Mississippi, but the Tennessee River.       Now, all the military preparations made in the West indicate that       the Mississippi River is the point to which the authorities are       directing their attention. On that river many battles must be       fought and heavy risks incurred, before any impression can be       made on the enemy, all of which could be avoided by using the       Tennessee River. This river is navigable for medium-class boats       to the foot of Muscle Shoals in Alabama, and is open to       navigation all the year, while the distance is but two hundred       and fifty miles by the river from Paducah on the Ohio. The       Tennessee offers many advantages over the Mississippi. We should       avoid the almost impregnable batteries of the enemy, which can       not be taken without great danger and great risk of life to our       forces, from the fact that our forces, if crippled, would fall a       prey to the enemy by being swept by the current to him, and away       from the relief of our friends. But even should we succeed, still       we have only begun the war, for we shall then have to fight the       country from whence the enemy derives his supplies.         Now an advance up the Tennessee River would avoid this danger;       for, if our boats were crippled, they would drop back with the       current and escape capture. But a still greater advantage would       be its tendency to _cut the enemy's lines in two_, by reaching       the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, threatening Memphis, which       lies one hundred miles due west, and no defensible point between;       also Nashville, only ninety miles north-east, and Florence and       Tuscumbia in North Alabama, forty miles east. A movement in this       direction would do more to relieve our friends in Kentucky, and       inspire the loyal hearts in East Tennessee, than the possession       of the whole of the Mississippi River. If well executed, it would       cause the evacuation of all those formidable fortifications on       which the rebels ground their hopes for success; and in the event       of our fleet attacking Mobile, the presence of our troops in the       northern part of Alabama, would be material aid to the fleet.         Again, the aid our forces would receive from the loyal men in       Tennessee would enable them soon to crush the last traitor in       that region, and the _separation of the two extremes_ would do       more than one hundred battles for the Union cause. The Tennessee       River is crossed by the Memphis and Louisville Railroad, and the       Memphis and Nashville Railroad. At Hamburg the river makes the       big bend on the east, touching the north-east corner of       Mississippi, entering the north-west corner of Alabama, forming       an arc to the south, entering the State of Tennessee at the       north-east corner of Alabama, and if it does not touch the       north-west corner of Georgia, comes very near it. It is but eight       miles from Hamburg to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, which       goes through Tuscumbia, only two miles from the river, which it       crosses at Decatur thirty miles above, intersecting with the       Nashville and Chattanooga road at Stephenson. The Tennessee never       has less than three feet to Hamburg on the \"shoalest\" bar, and       during the fall, winter, and spring months, there is always water       for the largest boats that are used on the Mississippi River. It       follows, from the above facts, that in making the Mississippi the       key to the war in the West, or rather in overlooking the       Tennessee River, the subject is not understood by the superiors       in command.    The War Department looked over these papers, and Col. Scott, the  Assistant Secretary, possessing a knowledge of the railroad facilities  and connections of the South, unequaled perhaps by any other man in  the country at that time, at once saw the vital importance of Miss  Carroll's plan. He declared it to be the first clear solution of the  difficult problem, and was soon sent West to assist in carrying it out  in detail. The Mississippi expedition was abandoned, and the Tennessee  made the point of attack. Both land and naval forces were ordered to  mass themselves at this point, and the country soon began to feel the  wisdom of this movement. The capture of Fort Henry, an important  Confederate post on the Tennessee River serving to defend the railroad  communication between Memphis and Bowling Green, was the first result  of Miss Carroll's plan. It fell Feb. 6, 1862, and was rapidly followed  by the capture of Fort Donelson, which, after a gallant "]]]
