Nam  Tempora & Spatia sunt sui ipsorum & rerum omnium quasi loca. In Tempore  quoad ordinem successionis; in Spatio quoad ordinem situs locantur  universa. De illorum Essentia est ut sint loca, & loca primaria moveri  absurdum est. Hæc sunt igitur absoluta loca, & solæ translationes de his  locis sunt absoluti motus.    Verum quoniam hæ spatii partes videri nequeunt, & ab invicem per sensus  nostros distingui, earum vice adhibemus mensuras sensibiles. Ex  positionibus enim & distantiis rerum a corpore aliquo, quod spectamus ut  immobile, definimus loca universa; deinde etiam & omnes motus æstimamus cum  respectu ad prædicta loca, quatenus corpora ab iisdem transferri  concipimus. Sic vice locorum & motuum absolutorum relativis utimur, nec  incommode in rebus humanis: in Philosophicis autem abstrahendum est a  sensibus. Fieri etenim potest ut nullum revera quiescat corpus, ad quod  loca motusq; referantur.    Distinguuntur autem Quies & Motus absoluti & relativi ab invicem per eorum  proprietates, causas & effectus. Quietis proprietas est, quod corpora vere  quiescentia quiescunt inter se. Ideoq; cum possibile sit ut corpus aliquod  in regionibus fixarum, aut longe ultra, quiescat absolute; sciri autem non  possit ex situ corporum ad invicem in regionibus nostris, utrum horum  aliquod ad longinquum illud datam positionem servet, quies vera ex horum  situ inter se definiri nequit.    Motus proprietas est, quod partes quæ datas servant positiones ad tota,  participant motus eorundem totorum. Nam gyrantium partes omnes conantur  recedere de axe motus, et progredientium impetus oritur ex conjuncto impetu  partium singularum. Igitur motis corporibus ambientibus, moventur quæ in  ambientibus relative quiescunt. Et propterea motus verus et absolutus  definiri nequit per translationem e vicinia corporum, quæ tanquam  quiescentia spectantur. Debent corpora externa non solum tanquam  quiescentia spectari, sed etiam vere quiescere. Alioquin inclusa omnia,  præter translationem e vicinia ambientium, participabunt etiam ambientium  motus veros, et sublata illa translatione non vere quiescent, sed tanquam  quiescentia solummodo spectabuntur; sunt enim ambientia ad inclusa ut  totius pars exterior ad partem interiorem, vel ut cortex ad nucleum. Moto  autem cortice, nucleus etiam, absq; translatione de vicinia corticis, ceu  pars totius, movetur.    Præcedenti proprietati affinis est, quod moto loco movetur una locatum,  adeoq; corpus, quod de loco moto movetur, participat etiam loci sui motum.  Igitur motus omnes, qui de locis motis fiunt, sunt partes solummodo motuum  integrorum et absolutorum, et motus omnis integer componitur ex motu  corporis de loco suo primo, et motu loci hujus de loco suo, et sic  deinceps, usq; dum perveniatur ad locum immotum, ut in exemplo Nautæ supra  memorato. Unde motus integri et absoluti non nisi per loca immota definiri  possunt, et propterea hos ad loca immota, relativos ad mobilia supra  retuli: Loca autem immota non sunt, nisi quæ omnia ab infinito in infinitum  datas servant positiones ad invicem, atq; adeo semper manent immota,  spatiumq; constituunt quod immobile appello.    Causæ, quibus motus veri et relativi distinguuntur ab invicem, sunt vires  in corpora impressæ ad motum generandum. Motus verus nec generatur nec  mutatur nisi per vires in ipsum corpus motum impressas: at motus relativus  generari et mutari potest absq; viribus impressis in hoc corpus. Sufficit  enim ut imprimantur in alia solum corpora ad quæ fit relatio, ut ijs  cedentibus mutetur relatio illa in qua hujus quies vel motus relativus  consistit. Rursus motus verus a viribus in corpus motum impressis semper  mutatur, at motus relativus ab his viribus non mutatur necessario. Nam si  eædem vires in alia etiam corpora, ad quæ fit relatio, sic imprimantur ut  situs relativus conservetur, conservabitur relatio in qua motus relativus  consistit. Mutari igitur potest motus omnis relativus ubi verus  conservatur, et conservari ubi verus mutatur; et propterea motus verus in  ejusmodi relationibus minime consistit.    Effectus quibus motus absoluti et relativi distinguuntur ab invicem, sunt  vires recedendi ab axe motus circularis. Nam in motu circulari nude  relativo hæ vires nullæ sunt, in vero autem et absoluto majores vel minores  pro quantitate motus. Si pendeat situla a filo prælongo, agaturq; perpetuo  in orbem donec filum a contorsione admodum rigescat, dein impleatur aqua,  et una cum aqua quiescat; tum vi aliqua subitanea agatur motu contrario in  orbem, et filo se relaxante, diutius perseveret in hoc motu: superficies  aquæ sub initio plana erit, quemadmodum ante motum vasis, at postquam, vi  in aquam paulatim impressa, effecit vas, ut hæc quoq; sensibiliter revolvi  incipiat, recedet ipsa paulatim e medio, ascendetq; ad latera vasis,  figuram concavam induens, (ut ipse expertus sum) et incitatiore semper motu  ascendet magis & magis, donec revolutiones in æqualibus cum vase temporibus  peragendo, quiescat in eodem relative. Indicat hic ascensus conatum  recedendi ab axe motus, & per talem conatum & innotescit & mensuratur motus  aquæ circularis verus & absolutus, motuiq; relativo hic omnino contrarius.  Initio ubi maximus erat aquæ motus relativus in vase, motus ille nullum  excitabat conatum recedendi ab axe: Aqua non petebat circumferentiam  ascendendo ad latera vasis, sed plana manebat, & propterea motus illius  circularis verus nondum inceperat. Postea vero ut aquæ motus relativus  decrevit, ascensus ejus ad latera vasis indicabat conatum recedendi ab axe,  atq; hic conatus monstrabat motum illius circularem verum perpetuo  crescentem, ac tandem maximum factum ubi aqua quiescebat in vase relative.  Igitur conatus iste non pendet a translatione aquæ respectu corporum  ambientium, & propterea motus circularis verus per tales translationes  definiri nequit. Unicus est corporis cujusq; revolventis motus vere  circularis, conatui unico tanquam proprio & adæquato effectui respondens;  motus autem relativi pro varijs relationibus ad externa innumeri sunt, &  relationum instar, effectibus veris omnino destituuntur, nisi quatenus de  vero illo & unico motu participant. Unde & in Systemate eorum qui Cælos  nostros infra Cælos fixarum in orbem revolvi volunt, & Planetas secum  deferre; Planetæ & singulæ Cælorum partes, qui relative quidem in Cælis  suis proximis quiescunt, moventur vere. Mutant enim positiones suas ad  invicem (secus quam fit in vere quiescentibus) unaq; cum cælis delati  participant eorum motus, & ut partes revolventium totorum, ab eorum axibus  recedere conantur.    Igitur quantitates relativæ non sunt eæ ipsæ quantitates quarum nomina præ  se ferunt, sed earum mensuræ illæ sensibiles (veræ an errantes) quibus  vulgus loco mensuratarum utitur. At si ex usu definiendæ sunt verborum  significationes; per nomina illa Temporis, Spatij, Loci & Motus proprie  intelligendæ erunt hæ mensuræ; & sermo erit insolens & pure Mathematicus si  quantitates mensuratæ hic subintelligantur. Proinde vim inferunt Sacris  literis qui voces hasce de quantitatibus mensuratis ibi interpretantur.  Neq; minus contaminant Mathesin & Philosophiam qui quantitates veras cum  ipsarum relationibus & vulgaribus mensuris confundunt.    Motus quidem veros corporum singulorum cognoscere, & ab apparentibus actu  discriminare, difficillimum est; propterea quod partes spatij illius  immobilis in quo corpora vere moventur, non incurrunt in sensus. Causa  tamen non est prorsus desperata. Nam suppetunt argumenta partim ex motibus  apparentibus, qui sunt motuum verorum differentiæ, partim ex viribus quæ  sunt motuum verorum causæ & effectus. Ut si globi duo ad datam ab invicem  distantiam filo intercedente connexi, revolverentur circa commune  gravitatis centrum; innotesceret ex tensione fili conatus globorum  recedendi ab axe motus, & inde quantitas motus circularis computari posset.  Deinde si vires quælibet æquales in alternas globorum facies ad motum  circularem augendum vel minuendum simul imprimerentur, innotesceret ex  aucta vel diminuta fili tensione augmentum vel decrementum motus; & inde  tandem inveniri possent facies globorum in quas vires imprimi deberent, ut  motus maxime augeretur, id est facies posticæ, sive quæ in motu circulari  sequuntur. Cognitis autem faciebus quæ sequuntur & faciebus oppositis quæ  præcedunt, cognosceretur determinatio motus. In hunc modum inveniri posset  & quantitas & determinatio motus hujus circularis in vacuo quovis immenso,  ubi nihil extaret externum & sensibile, quocum globi conferri possent. Si  jam constituerentur in spatio illo corpora aliqua longinqua datam inter se  positionem servantia, qualia sunt stellæ fixæ in regionibus nostris: sciri  quidem non posset ex relativa globorum translatione inter corpora, utrum  his an illis tribuendus esset motus. At si attenderetur ad filum &  inveniretur tensionem ejus illam ipsam esse quam motus globorum requireret;  concludere liceret motum esse globorum, & tum demum ex translatione  globorum inter corpora, determinationem hujus motus colligere. Motus autem  veros ex eorum causis, effectibus & apparentibus differentijs colligere, &  contra, ex motibus seu veris seu apparentibus, eorum causas & effectus,  docebitur fusius in sequentibus.

First in order of time came the art of  observing the returns, and measuring the places, of the heavenly bodies.  This was the sole astronomy of the Chinese and Chaldeans; but to it the  vigorous Greek mind added a highly complex geometrical plan of their  movements, for which Copernicus substituted a more harmonious system,  without as yet any idea of a compelling cause. The planets revolved in  circles because it was their nature to do so, just as laudanum sets to  sleep because it possesses a _virtus dormitiva_. This first and oldest  branch is known as \"observational,\" or \"practical astronomy.\" Its  business is to note facts as accurately as possible; and it is  essentially unconcerned with schemes for connecting those facts in a  manner satisfactory to the reason.    The second kind of astronomy was founded by Newton. Its nature is best  indicated by the term \"gravitational\"; but it is also called  \"theoretical astronomy.\"[1] It is based on the idea of cause; and the  whole of its elaborate structure is reared according to the dictates of  a single law, simple in itself, but the tangled web of whose  consequences can be unravelled only by the subtle agency of an elaborate  calculus.    The third and last division of celestial science may properly be termed  \"physical and descriptive astronomy.\" It seeks to know what the heavenly  bodies are in themselves, leaving the How? and the Wherefore? of their  movements to be otherwise answered. Now, such inquiries became possible  only through the invention of the telescope, so that Galileo was, in  point of fact, their originator. But Herschel first gave them a  prominence which the whole progress of science during the nineteenth  century served to confirm and render more exclusive. Inquisitions begun  with the telescope have been extended and made effective in unhoped-for  directions by the aid of the spectroscope and photographic camera; and a  large part of our attention in the present volume will be occupied with  the brilliant results thus achieved.    The unexpected development of this new physical-celestial science is the  leading fact in recent astronomical history. It was out of the regular  course of events. In the degree in which it has actually occurred it  could certainly not have been foreseen. It was a seizing of the prize by  a competitor who had hardly been thought qualified to enter the lists.  Orthodox astronomers of the old school looked with a certain contempt  upon observers who spent their nights in scrutinising the faces of the  moon and planets rather than in timing their transits, or devoted  daylight energies, not to reductions and computations, but to counting  and measuring spots on the sun. They were regarded as irregular  practitioners, to be tolerated perhaps, but certainly not encouraged.    The advance of astronomy in the eighteenth century ran in general an  even and logical course. The age succeeding Newton's had for its special  task to demonstrate the universal validity, and trace the complex  results, of the law of gravitation. The accomplishment of that task  occupied just one hundred years. It was virtually brought to a close  when Laplace explained to the French Academy, November 19, 1787, the  cause of the moon's accelerated motion. As a mere machine, the solar  system, so far as it was then known, was found to be complete and  intelligible in all its parts; and in the _Mecanique Celeste_ its  mechanical perfections were displayed under a form of majestic unity  which fitly commemorated the successive triumphs of analytical genius  over problems amongst the most arduous ever dealt with by the mind of  man.    Theory, however, demands a practical test. All its data are derived from  observation; and their insecurity becomes less tolerable as it advances  nearer to perfection. Observation, on the other hand, is the pitiless  critic of theory; it detects weak points, and provokes reforms which may  be the beginnings of discovery. Thus, theory and observation mutually  act and react, each alternately taking the lead in the endless race of  improvement.    Now, while in France Lagrange and Laplace were bringing the  gravitational theory of the solar system to completion, work of a very  different kind, yet not less indispensable to the future welfare of  astronomy, was being done in England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich  is one of the few useful institutions which date their origin from the  reign of Charles II. The leading position which it still occupies in the  science of celestial observation was, for near a century and a half  after its foundation, an exclusive one. Delambre remarked that, had all  other materials of the kind been destroyed, the Greenwich records alone  would suffice for the restoration of astronomy. The establishment was  indeed absolutely without a rival.[2] Systematic observations of sun,  moon, stars, and planets were during the whole of the eighteenth century  made only at Greenwich. Here materials were accumulated for the secure  correction of theory, and here refinements were introduced by which the  exquisite accuracy of modern practice in astronomy was eventually  attained.    The chief promoter of these improvements was James Bradley. Few men have  possessed in an equal degree with him the power of seeing accurately,  and reasoning on what they see. He let nothing pass. The slightest  inconsistency between what appeared and what was to be expected roused  his keenest attention; and he never relaxed his mental grip of a subject  until it had yielded to his persistent inquisition. It was to these  qualities that he owed his discoveries of the aberration of light and  the nutation of the earth's axis. The first was announced in 1729. What  is meant by it is that, owing to the circumstance of light not being  instantaneously transmitted, the heavenly bodies appear shifted from  their true places by an amount depending upon the ratio which the  velocity of light bears to the speed of the earth in its orbit. Because  light travels with enormous rapidity, the shifting is very slight; and  each star returns to its original position at the end of a year.    Bradley's second great discovery was finally ascertained in 1748.  Nutation is a real \"nodding\" of the terrestrial axis produced by the  dragging of the moon at the terrestrial equatorial protuberance. From it  results an _apparent_ displacement of the stars, each of them describing  a little ellipse about its true or \"mean\" position, in a period of  nearly nineteen years.    Now, an acquaintance with the fact and the laws of each of these minute  irregularities is vital to the progress of observational astronomy; for  without it the places of the heavenly bodies could never be accurately  known or compared. So that Bradley, by their detection, at once raised  the science to a higher grade of precision. Nor was this the whole of  his work. Appointed Astronomer-Royal in 1742, he executed during the  years 1750-62 a series of observations which formed the real beginning  of exact astronomy. Part of their superiority must, indeed, be  attributed to the co-operation of John Bird, who provided Bradley in  1750 with a measuring instrument of till then unequalled excellence. For  not only was the art of observing in the eighteenth century a peculiarly  English art, but the means of observing were furnished almost  exclusively by British artists. John Dollond, the son of a Spitalfields  weaver, invented the achromatic lens in 1758, removing thereby the chief  obstacle to the development of the powers of refracting telescopes;  James Short, of Edinburgh, was without a rival in the construction of  reflectors; the sectors, quadrants, and circles of Graham, Bird,  Ramsden, and Cary were inimitable by Continental workmanship.    Thus practical and theoretical astronomy advanced on parallel lines in  England and France respectively, the improvement of"]]]
