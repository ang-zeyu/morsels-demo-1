He was too successful to escape the poisoned arrows of envy, or the  misrepresentations of the disappointed. Certain persons exclaimed  against his want of consistency, and gave as a reason that at one  period he commanded the spirit of liberty with which the French  Revolution commenced, and after a time turned away in horror and disgust  from a people who made murder a pastime, and converted Paris into a  shambles for human flesh.    But nothing could permanently obscure the fame of the eloquent Irishman,  he continued to act with such worthiness, that, despite his schism with  Charles James Fox, \"the people\" did him the justice to believe, that in  his public conduct, he had no one view but the public good.    He outlived calumny, uniting unto genius diligence, and unto diligence  patience, and unto patience enthusiasm, and to these, deep-hearted  enthusiasm, with a knowledge, not only, it would seem, of all things,  but of such ready application, that in illustration or argument his  resources were boundless; the wisdom of the Ancients was as familiar to  him as the improved state of modern politics, science, and laws; the  metaphysics and logic of the Schools were to him as household words, and  his memory was gemmed with whatever was most valuable in poetry,  history, and the arts.    [Illustration: GREGORIES.]    After much toil, and the lapse of some time, he purchased a domain in  Buckinghamshire, called \"Gregories;\" there, whenever his public duties  gave him leisure, he enjoyed the repose so necessary to an overtaxed  brain; and from Gregories some of his most interesting letters are  dated.[3] Those addressed to the painter Barry, _whom his liberality  sent to and supported in Rome_, are, as we have said, replete with art  and wisdom; and the delicacy of both him and his excellent brother  Richard, while entreating the rough-hewn genius to prosecute his studies  and give them pleasure by his improvement, are additional proofs of the  beautiful union of the brothers, and of their _oneness_ of purpose and  determination that Barry should never be cramped by want of means.[4]    After the purchase of Gregories[5] Mr. Burke had no settled town-house,  merely occupying one for the season. In one of his letters to Barry, he  tells him to direct to Charles-street, St. James's Square; he writes  also from Fludyer-street, Westminster, and from Gerrard-street, Soho;  but traces of his \"whereabouts\" are next to impossible to find. Barry  was not the only artist who profited by Edmund Burke's liberality.  Barret, the landscape-painter, had fallen into difficulties, and the  fact coming to the orator's ears during his short tenure in power, he  bestowed upon him a place in Chelsea Hospital, which he enjoyed during  the remainder of his life.    Indeed, this great man's noble love of Art was part and parcel of  himself; it was no affectation, and it led to genuine sympathy with, not  only the artist's triumphs, but his difficulties. He found time, amid  all his occupations, to write letters to the irritable Barry, and if the  painter had followed their counsel, he would have secured his peace and  prosperity; but it was far otherwise: his conduct, both in Rome and  after his return to England, gave his friend just cause of offence;  though, like all others who offended the magnanimous Burke, he was soon  forgiven.    He never forgot his Irish friends, or the necessities of those who lived  on the family estate; the expansive generosity of his nature did not  prevent his attending to the minor comforts of his dependants, and his  letters \"home\" frequently breathe a most loving and careful spirit, that  the sorrows of the poor might be ameliorated, and their wants relieved.    We ought to have mentioned before that Mr. and Mrs. Burke's marriage was  only blessed by two sons; one died in childhood, the eldest grew up a  young man of the warmest affections, and blessed with a considerable  share of talent; to his parents he was every thing they could desire;  towards his mother he exhibited the tenderness and devotion of a  daughter, and his demeanor to his father was that of an obedient son,  and most faithful friend; at intervals he enjoyed with them the pleasure  they experienced in receiving guests of the highest consideration;  amongst them the eccentric Madame de Genlis, who put their politeness to  the test by the exercise of her peculiarities, and horrified the meek  and amiable Sir Joshua Reynolds by the assumption of talents she did not  possess.    The publication of his reflections on the French Revolution, which,  perhaps, never would have seen the light but for the rupture with Mr.  Sheridan, which caused his opinions to be misunderstood, brought down  the applause of Europe on a head then wearying of public life.    But, perhaps, a tribute Burke valued more than any, remembering the  adage--an adage which, unhappily, especially applies to Ireland--\"no man  is a prophet in his own country,\" was, that on a motion of the provost  of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1790, the honorary degree of LL.D. was  conferred upon him in full convocation, and an address afterwards  presented in a gold box, to express the University's sense of his  services. When he replied to this distinguished compliment, his town  residence was in \"Duke-street, St. James.\"    His term of life--over-tasked as it was--might have been extended to a  much longer period, but that his deeply affectionate nature, as time  passed on, experienced several of those shocks inseparable from even  moderate length of days; many of his friends died; among others, his  sister and his brother; but still the wife of his bosom and his son were  with him--that son whose talents he rated as superior to his own, whom  he had consulted for some years on almost every subject, whether of a  public or a private nature, that occurred, and very frequently preferred  his judgment to his own. This beloved son had attained the age of  thirty-four, when he was seized with rapid consumption. When the malady  was recognized and acknowledged, his father took him to Brompton, then,  as now, considered the best air for those affected with this cruel  malady. \"Cromwell House,\" chosen as their temporary residence, is  standing still, though there is little doubt the rage for extending  London through this once sequestered and rural suburb, will soon raze it  to the ground, as it has done others of equal interest.    [Illustration: CROMWELL HOUSE.]    We have always regarded \"Cromwell House,\" as it is called, with  veneration. In our earliest acquaintance with a neighborhood, in which  we lived so long and still love so well, this giant dwelling, staring  with its whited walls and balconied roof over the tangled gardens which  seemed to cut it off from all communication with the world, was  associated with our \"Hero Worship\" of Oliver Cromwell. We were told he  had lived there (what neighborhood has not its \"Cromwell House?\")--that  the ghastly old place had private staircases and subterranean  passages--some underground communication with Kensington--that there  were doors in the walls, and out of the walls; and, that if not careful  you might be precipitated through trap-doors into some unfathomable  abyss, and encounter the ghost of old Oliver himself. These tales  operated upon our imagination in the usual way; and many and many a  moonlight evening, while wandering in those green lanes--now obliterated  by Onslow and Thurloe Squares--and listening to the nightingales, have  we watched the huge shadows cast by that solitary and melancholy-looking  house, and, as we have said, associated it with the stern and grand  Protector of England. Upon closer investigation, how grieved we have  often been to discover the truth, for it destroyed not only our castles  in the air, but their inhabitants; we found that Oliver never resided  there, but that his son, Richard, had, and was a rate payer to the  parish of Kensington for some time. To this lonely sombre house Mr. and  Mrs. Burke and their son removed, in the hope that the soft mild air of  this salubrious neighborhood might restore his failing strength; the  consciousness of his being in danger was something too terrible for them  to think of. He had just received a new appointment--an appointment  suited to his tastes and expectations; he must take possession of it in  a little time. He was their child, their friend, their treasure, their  all! Surely God would spare him to close their eyes. How could death and  he meet together? They entreated him of God, by prayer, and  supplication, and tears that flowed until their eyes were dry and their  eyelids parched--but all in vain. The man, in his prime of manhood, was  stricken down; we transcribe, from an article in the _Quarterly Review_,  on \"Fontenelle's Signs of Death,\" the brief account of his last moments:    \"Burke's son, upon whom his father has conferred something of his own  celebrity, heard his parents sobbing in another room at the prospect of  an event they knew to be inevitable. He rose from his bed, joined his  illustrious father, and endeavored to engage him in a cheerful  conversation. Burke continued silent, choked with grief. His son again  made an effort to console him. 'I am under no terror,' he said; 'I feel  myself better and in spirits, and yet my heart flutters, I know not why.  Pray, talk to me, sir! talk of religion; talk of morality; talk, if you  will, of indifferent subjects.' Here a noise attracted his notice, and  he exclaimed, 'Does it rain?--No; it is the rustling of the wind through  the trees.' The whistling of the wind and the waving of the trees  brought Milton's majestic lines to his mind, and he repeated them with  uncommon grace and effect:        'His praise, ye winds, that from four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/227"],[0,"Aeneidos (#3)"],[1,"ne quis eos, neu quis contingere posset,    molirive moram, aut veniendi poscere causas.

Iamque ascendebant collem, qui plurimus urbi    imminet, adversasque adspectat desuper arces.    Miratur molem Aeneas, magalia quondam,    miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum.    Instant ardentes Tyrii pars ducere muros,    molirique arcem et manibus subvolvere saxa,    pars optare locum tecto et concludere sulco.    [Iura magistratusque legunt sanctumque senatum;]    hic portus alii effodiunt; hic alta theatris    fundamenta locant alii, immanisque columnas    rupibus excidunt, scaenis decora alta futuris.    Qualis apes aestate nova per florea rura    exercet sub sole labor, cum gentis adultos    educunt fetus, aut cum liquentia mella    stipant et dulci distendunt nectare cellas,    aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto    ignavom fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent:    fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.    'O fortunati, quorum iam moenia surgunt!'    Aeneas ait, et fastigia suspicit urbis.    Infert se saeptus nebula, mirabile dictu,    per medios, miscetque viris, neque cernitur ulli.      Lucus in urbe fuit media, laetissimus umbra,    quo primum iactati undis et turbine Poeni    effodere loco signum, quod regia Iuno    monstrarat, caput acris equi; sic nam fore bello    egregiam et facilem victu per saecula gentem.    Hic templum Iunoni ingens Sidonia Dido    condebat, donis opulentum et numine divae,    aerea cui gradibus surgebant limina, nexaeque    aere trabes, foribus cardo stridebat aenis.    Hoc primum in luco nova res oblata timorem    leniit, hic primum Aeneas sperare salutem    ausus, et adflictis melius confidere rebus.    Namque sub ingenti lustrat dum singula templo,    reginam opperiens, dum, quae fortuna sit urbi,    artificumque manus inter se operumque laborem    miratur, videt Iliacas ex ordine pugnas,    bellaque iam fama totum volgata per orbem,    Atridas, Priamumque, et saevum ambobus Achillem.    Constitit, et lacrimans, 'Quis iam locus' inquit 'Achate,    quae regio in terris nostri non plena laboris?    En Priamus! Sunt hic etiam sua praemia laudi;    sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt.    Solve metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem.'    Sic ait, atque animum pictura pascit inani,    multa gemens, largoque umectat flumine voltum.      Namque videbat, uti bellantes Pergama circum    hac fugerent Graii, premeret Troiana iuventus,    hac Phryges, instaret curru cristatus Achilles.    Nec procul hinc Rhesi niveis tentoria velis    adgnoscit lacrimans, primo quae prodita somno    Tydides multa vastabat caede cruentus,    ardentisque avertit equos in castra, prius quam    pabula gustassent Troiae Xanthumque bibissent.    Parte alia fugiens amissis Troilus armis,    infelix puer atque impar congressus Achilli,    fertur equis, curruque haeret resupinus inani,    lora tenens tamen; huic cervixque comaeque trahuntur    per terram, et versa pulvis inscribitur hasta.    Interea ad templum non aequae Palladis ibant    crinibus Iliades passis peplumque ferebant,    suppliciter tristes et tunsae pectora palmis;    diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat.    Ter circum Iliacos raptaverat Hectora muros,    exanimumque auro corpus vendebat Achilles.    Tum vero ingentem gemitum dat pectore ab imo,    ut spolia, ut currus, utque ipsum corpus amici,    tendentemque manus Priamum conspexit inermis.    Se quoque principibus permixtum adgnovit Achivis,    Eoasque acies et nigri Memnonis arma.    Ducit Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis    Penthesilea furens, mediisque in milibus ardet,    aurea subnectens exsertae cingula mammae,    bellatrix, audetque viris concurrere virgo.      Haec dum Dardanio Aeneae miranda videntur,    dum stupet, obtutuque haeret defixus in uno,    regina ad templum, forma pulcherrima Dido,    incessit magna iuvenum stipante caterva.    Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per iuga Cynthi    exercet Diana choros, quam mille secutae    hinc atque hinc glomerantur oreades; illa pharetram    fert umero, gradiensque deas supereminet omnis:    Latonae tacitum pertemptant gaudia pectus:    talis erat Dido, talem se laeta ferebat    per medios, instans operi regnisque futuris.    Tum foribus divae, media testudine templi,    saepta armis, solioque alte subnixa resedit.    Iura dabat legesque viris, operumque laborem    partibus aequabat iustis, aut sorte trahebat:    cum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno    Anthea Sergestumque videt fortemque Cloanthum,    Teucrorumque alios, ater quos aequore turbo    dispulerat penitusque alias avexerat oras.    Obstipuit simul ipse simul perculsus Achates    laetitiaque metuque; avidi coniungere dextras    ardebant; sed res animos incognita turbat.    Dissimulant, et nube cava speculantur amicti,    quae fortuna viris, classem quo litore linquant,    quid veniant; cunctis nam lecti navibus ibant,    orantes veniam, et templum clamore petebant.      Postquam introgressi et coram data copia fandi,    axumus Ilioneus placido sic pectore coepit:    'O Regina, novam cui condere Iuppiter urbem    iustitiaque dedit gentis frenare superbas,    Troes te miseri, ventis maria omnia vecti,    oramus, prohibe infandos a navibus ignis,    parce pio generi, et propius res aspice nostras.    Non nos aut ferro Libycos populare Penatis    venimus, aut raptas ad litora vertere praedas;    non ea vis animo, nec tanta superbia victis.    Est locus, Hesperiam Grai cognomine dicunt,    terra antiqua, potens armis atque ubere glaebae;    Oenotri coluere viri; nunc fama minores    Italiam dixisse ducis de nomine gentem.    Hic cursus fuit:    cum subito adsurgens fluctu nimbosus Orion    in vada caeca tulit, penitusque procacibus austris    perque undas, superante salo, perque invia saxa    dispulit; huc pauci vestris adnavimus oris.    Quod genus hoc hominum?  Quaeve hunc tam barbara morem    permittit patria?  Hospitio prohibemur harenae;    bella cient, primaque vetant consistere terra.    Si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma    at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi.      'Rex erat Aeneas nobis, quo iustior alter,    nec pietate fuit, nec bello maior et armis.    Quem si fata virum servant, si vescitur aura    aetheria, neque adhuc crudelibus occubat umbris,    non metus; officio nec te certasse priorem    poeniteat.  Sunt et Siculis regionibus urbes    arvaque, Troianoque a sanguine clarus Acestes.    Quassatam ventis liceat subducere classem,    et silvis aptare trabes et stringere remos:    si datur Italiam, sociis et rege recepto,    tendere, ut Italiam laeti Latiumque petamus;    sin absumpta salus, et te, pater optume Teucrum,    pontus habet Lybiae, nec spes iam restat Iuli,    at freta Sicaniae saltem sedesque paratas,    unde huc advecti, regemque petamus Acesten.'      Talibus Ilioneus; cuncti simul ore fremebant    Dardanidae.      Tum breviter Dido, voltum demissa, profatur:    'Solvite corde metum, Teucri, secludite curas.    Res dura et regni novitas me talia cogunt    moliri, et late finis custode tueri.    Quis genus Aeneadum, quis Troiae nesciat urbem,    virtutesque virosque, aut tanti incendia belli?    Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni,    nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol iungit ab urbe.    Seu vos Hesperiam magnam Saturniaque arva,    sive Erycis finis regemque optatis Acesten,    auxilio tutos dimittam, opibusque iuvabo.    Voltis et his mecum pariter considere regnis;    urbem quam statuo vestra est, subducite navis;    Tros Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur.    Atque utinam rex ipse Noto compulsus eodem    adforet Aeneas! Equidem per litora certos    dimittam et Libyae lustrare extrema iubebo,    si quibus eiectus silvis aut urbibus errat.'      His animum arrecti dictis et fortis Achates    et pater Aeneas iamdudum erumpere nubem    ardebant.  Prior Aenean compellat Achates:    'Nate dea, quae nunc animo sententia surgit?    omnia tuta vides, classem sociosque receptos.    Unus abest, medio in fluctu quem vidimus ipsi    submersum; dictis respondent cetera matris.'      Vix ea fatus erat, cum circumfusa repente    scindit se nubes et in aethera purgat apertum.    Restitit Aeneas claraque in luce refulsit,    os umerosque deo similis; namque ipsa decoram    caesariem nato genetrix lumenque iuventae    purpureum et laetos oculis adflarat honores:    quale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flavo    argentum Pariusve lapis circumdatur auro.      Tum sic reginam adloquitur, cunctisque repente    improvisus ait:  'Coram, quem quaeritis, adsum,    Troius Aeneas, Lybicis ereptus ab undis.    O sola infandos Troiae miserata labores,    quae nos, reliquias Danaum, terraeque marisque    omnibus exhaustos iam casibus, omnium egenos,    urbe, domo, socias, grates persolvere dignas    non opis est nostrae, Dido, nec quicquid ubique est    gentis Dardaniae, magnum quae sparsa per orbem.    Di tibi, si qua pios respectant numina, si quid    usquam iustitia est et mens sibi conscia recti,    praemia digna ferant.  Quae te tam laeta tulerunt    saecula?  Qui tanti talem genuere parentes?    In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae    lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet,    semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt,    quae me cumque vocant terrae.'  Sic fatus, amicum    Ilionea petit dextra, laevaque Serestum,    post alios, fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum.      Obstipuit primo aspectu Sidonia Dido,    casu deinde viri tanto, et sic ore locuta est:    'Quis te, nate dea, per tanta pericula casus    insequitur?  Quae vis immanibus applicat oris?    Tune ille Aeneas, quem Dardanio Anchisae    alma Venus Phrygii genuit Simoentis ad undam?    Atque equidem Teucrum memini Sidona venire    finibus expulsum patriis, nova regna petentem    auxilio Beli; genitor tum Belus opimam    vastabat"]]]
