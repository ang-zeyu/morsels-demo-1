Do we attribute all the mercies of physical life to a  supreme intelligence? Has that intelligence created us and left us  endowed with \"Inexhaustible hope,\" to be disappointed forever, and the  only result, the \"imaginary\" creation of the Christian's happy heaven.  But Volney makes another grand concession in the quotation which I have  given, and that is the nature of the Christian's future world in its  relations to wrongs as well as tyrants, neither are to exist there. That  the Christian's religion, with its beautiful world, does fill up the  soul's demands is a fact unintentionally conceded by Volney, and known  throughout the land in the contentment and bliss and heroism of the  dying Christian. In this hope alone man's spiritual wants are met. This,  with all that pertains to it, is in the revelation that God has made to  our race. How could this be made? I answer, it was made by the spirit of  God. \"Holy men of old spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit.\"  This is what we call _inspiration_. This word is a translation of  \"_Theopneustos_,\" which is from \"Theos,\" _God_, \"pneuma,\" _spirit_,  _Spirit of God_. Is it reasonable to allow that this revelation could be  given by the spirit of God through holy men? I will let an infidel  answer this question. Bolingbroke said, \"It is just as easy to  comprehend the operation of the spirit of God upon the mind of a prophet  in order to give his will to us as it is to comprehend the operations of  our own spirits upon our physical nature in order to an expression of  our own thoughts.\" Has such a revelation been made? From all we know of  man, his wants, and the adaptation of means in nature to those wants, we  are driven to the conclusion that it has, presenting the means adapted  to our spiritual wants so perfectly as to enable us to realize fully  what Volney declares our very nature, as creatures of hope, impelled us  to create \"in our imaginations for ourselves.\" There is no consistent  ground that any man can occupy between Christianity and Atheism. And if  there is no God, \"nature,\" or the \"forces,\" or whatever lies behind  them, to which they belong, as the manifest energies of the same, call  it what you may, has made a very unreasonable, bungling mistake in  giving in the very nature of man's mind an empty vessel that is to be  filled only by the false whims of the imagination of an ever restless  and dissatisfied spirit, which, in that case, is to be eternally  disappointed and plunged deeper down by the realization of the fact that  all its anxieties and hopes were only so many misleading demons.    In order to a perfect revelation of God to man it was necessary that the  entire page, the \"background\" as well as the \"foreground,\" or the human  as well as the divine, should be truth, and in every case, all the truth  that was necessary to enable man to realize and understand the whys and  wherefores of the divine procedure; and also to call out in word or  action the Divine Being in all his relations to the conduct of the  children of men. Such a record is found in the Bible, given to us by men  who were impelled and borne by the Holy Spirit when they wrote and  spoke. But it was not necessary that anything upon the dark human  \"background\" of this picture should have its origin with God; it was  only necessary that, having originated with man, men or demons, it  should be put to record just as it was in all its heinousness and  wickedness in order that we might see the true character of God in his  relations to it. If a wise physician should undertake to make himself  known to the world he would not give us a history of all he did with  every patient, and at the same time fail to give us just so much of the  true history of each patient as would be necessary to enable us to  understand him in all that he did, for both stand or fall together. So  it is in the Bible revelation of God to man. Take away the \"background\"  of the picture, and the picture itself is destroyed. That which skeptics  in their ignorance are always trying to ridicule is just as essential to  a revelation of God in his justice, purity, love and power as the word  of God himself. That is to say, the revelation has an objective as well  as a subjective side. The subjective is God in his attributes, and the  objective is man in his works. It was the objective that drew out the  subjective, because all was done for the objective. Take either side  away and the revelation ceases to exist. On the subjective side all is  of God in its origin, is charged up to him, being spoken by him, and in  his name, or done by him, or by his authority. The indices to this great  truth are in these or similar phrases, \"Hear, O, Israel, thus saith the  Lord, thy God,\" \"Thus saith the Lord,\" \"And the Lord said,\" \"The Lord  spake, saying,\" \"The Lord said unto me,\" \"The word of the Lord came unto  me,\" \"The Lord commanded,\" \"The burthen of the word of the Lord to,\"  \"The Lord answered, saying.\" We are not authorized to charge, as many  through their ignorance or wickedness have done, all that we read about  in the Bible to God as the author. The words and doings of wicked men  and demons are truthfully recorded there, and they are often licentious  and blasphemous. The words and doings of good men and angels are there,  and the words and doings of God are there. We are authorized to charge  to God's account that only which is spoken in his name, or by his  instructions, along with that which was done by him, or by his  authority, or approved by him. When we get outside of these  common-sense thoughts in our interpretations of Bible history we are  acting upon our own responsibility, and are liable to be found doing  violence to the divine will. If we contradict the record we call in  question the veracity of the spirit which controlled the writer, whether  the statement relates to God, man or demons. But this statement does not  apply to mistranslations, for it is one thing to contradict an  uninspired translator, and another altogether to contradict the  statement of one controlled by the spirit of God. We fearlessly assert  that the Bible is just the book that common-sense and reason demands  that it should be in order to contain a revelation of God to man. We  would as soon attempt to destroy the divine and lovely side, as change  its character, so far as to take from its pages its record of  wickedness, misery and woe, for it amounts to the same thing. One more  question of importance bearing on this subject demands our attention,  and that is the question of miracles. Men have, without any authority  from the Bible, treated all miracles as violations of natural law. But  it would be well for us to determine the extent of our knowledge of  natural laws before we thus dogmatize. That which we call miracle may be  in perfect harmony with law that lies just beyond our knowledge.  Omniscience seems to be a necessary qualification for such theorizing as  asserts that miracles are violations of the laws of nature. Omnipotence  is an essential attribute of the Ruler of the universe. But in order to  its existence, the Infinite one must be above the laws which he has  established, able to take hold of those laws and handle them as he sees  proper, otherwise he is not all-powerful. On the simple plane of nature  we get lost. Who can account for \"Partheno Genesis,\" or generation  without any known sexual organs, which obtains in the animal kingdom.  \"The spirit of God moved upon,\" \"brooded over\" the face of the great  deep and life filled the waters. \"The Holy Spirit overshadowed the  Virgin\" and the Nazarene was begotten. The original expresses the same  idea in both cases. Scientists who are radical materialists admit this  wonderful feat in the animal kingdom as a natural affair, and yet,  without any authority from the Bible, speak of the birth of Christ as  the result of \"Miraculous conception,\" in the sense of a violation of  natural law. What natural law is violated in \"Partheno Genesis?\" With me  it is allowable that a thousand more just such beings might be, and if  necessary to the accomplishment of the great purposes of God, would be  produced under the same circumstances and by the same instrumentalities.  The feature of the question of miracles which bears on the subject of a  divine revelation must now be considered. It is this, would a book  containing such a record as that which we have in the Bible, except the  record of miracles, reveal God in his attributes to our world? We lay it  down as a correct proposition that we must have creative and life-giving  power manifested in order to a revelation of God.    If the Bible contained no record of the exercise of powers above the  human it would reveal only a human God, which would be no God; and  common sense would declare, \"It is a book treating of, and presenting  man in his attributes.\" Those facts upon its pages which are in the  power of God alone confirm, that is, make sure, the revelation of God to  man. Without this feature of the book common sense would have at least  one good excuse for rejecting its claims. The Master recognizes this  fact in the saying, \"If I do not the works of my Father believe me not,  but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may  know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.\" Here we have  the fact of \"God revealed in the flesh,\" evinced by the works which the  Savior performed. The foundation of faith, or the obligation to believe,  is identified with those works. They were a greater evidence of his  divinity than the words of any prophet, although those words were the  words of the Divine Spirit. Jesus said, \"I have greater witness than  that of John, for the works"]]]
