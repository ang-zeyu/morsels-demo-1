I would at once suggest  some brandy or whisky, perhaps of a luxurious sort, from a flask in the  pocket of Mr Glass. We have thus something like a picture of the man, or  at least of the type: tall, elderly, fashionable, but somewhat frayed,  certainly fond of play and strong waters, perhaps rather too fond of  them. Mr Glass is a gentleman not unknown on the fringes of society.\"    \"Look here,\" cried the young woman, \"if you don't let me pass to untie  him I'll run outside and scream for the police.\"    \"I should not advise you, Miss MacNab,\" said Dr Hood gravely, \"to be  in any hurry to fetch the police. Father Brown, I seriously ask you to  compose your flock, for their sakes, not for mine. Well, we have seen  something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass; what are the chief  facts known of Mr Todhunter? They are substantially three: that he is  economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that he has a secret.  Now, surely it is obvious that there are the three chief marks of the  kind of man who is blackmailed. And surely it is equally obvious that  the faded finery, the profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr  Glass are the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him.  We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money: on the one  hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other, the West-end  vulture with a scent for a mystery. These two men have met here today  and have quarrelled, using blows and a bare weapon.\"    \"Are you going to take those ropes off?\" asked the girl stubbornly.    Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table, and went  across to the captive. He studied him intently, even moving him a little  and half-turning him round by the shoulders, but he only answered:    \"No; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police  bring the handcuffs.\"    Father Brown, who had been looking dully at the carpet, lifted his round  face and said: \"What do you mean?\"    The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword from the  carpet and was examining it intently as he answered:    \"Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up,\" he said, \"you all jump to the  conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up; and then, I suppose, escaped.  There are four objections to this: First, why should a gentleman so  dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left of his  own free will? Second,\" he continued, moving towards the window, \"this  is the only exit, and it is locked on the inside. Third, this blade  here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is no wound on Mr  Todhunter. Mr Glass took that wound away with him, dead or alive. Add  to all this primary probability. It is much more likely that the  blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus, rather than that the  blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg. There,  I think, we have a pretty complete story.\"    \"But the ropes?\" inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained open with  a rather vacant admiration.    \"Ah, the ropes,\" said the expert with a singular intonation. \"Miss  MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from  his ropes. Well, I will tell her. I did not do it because Mr Todhunter  can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses.\"    \"What?\" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment.    \"I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter,\" reiterated Hood  quietly. \"I happen to know something about knots; they are quite a  branch of criminal science. Every one of those knots he has made himself  and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made by an  enemy really trying to pinion him. The whole of this affair of the  ropes is a clever fake, to make us think him the victim of the struggle  instead of the wretched Glass, whose corpse may be hidden in the garden  or stuffed up the chimney.\"    There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darkening, the  sea-blighted boughs of the garden trees looked leaner and blacker than  ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window. One could  almost fancy they were sea-monsters like krakens or cuttlefish, writhing  polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy,  even as he, the villain and victim of it, the terrible man in the tall  hat, had once crawled up from the sea. For the whole air was dense with  the morbidity of blackmail, which is the most morbid of human things,  because it is a crime concealing a crime; a black plaster on a blacker  wound.    The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent  and even comic, had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown. It  was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence. It was rather that  creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea.  \"Say it again, please,\" he said in a simple, bothered manner; \"do you  mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all  alone?\"    \"That is what I mean,\" said the doctor.    \"Jerusalem!\" ejaculated Brown suddenly, \"I wonder if it could possibly  be that!\"    He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit, and peered with quite  a new impulsiveness into the partially-covered face of the captive. Then  he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company. \"Yes, that's it!\"  he cried in a certain excitement. \"Can't you see it in the man's face?  Why, look at his eyes!\"    Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance.  And though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half of  Todhunter's visage, they did grow conscious of something struggling and  intense about the upper part of it.    \"His eyes do look queer,\" cried the young woman, strongly moved. \"You  brutes; I believe it's hurting him!\"    \"Not that, I think,\" said Dr Hood; \"the eyes have certainly a singular  expression. But I should interpret those transverse wrinkles as  expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality--\"    \"Oh, bosh!\" cried Father Brown: \"can't you see he's laughing?\"    \"Laughing!\" repeated the doctor, with a start; \"but what on earth can he  be laughing at?\"    \"Well,\" replied the Reverend Brown apologetically, \"not to put too fine  a point on it, I think he is laughing at you. And indeed, I'm a little  inclined to laugh at myself, now I know about it.\"    \"Now you know about what?\" asked Hood, in some exasperation.    \"Now I know,\" replied the priest, \"the profession of Mr Todhunter.\"    He shuffled about the room, looking at one object after another with  what seemed to be a vacant stare, and then invariably bursting into an  equally vacant laugh, a highly irritating process for those who had to  watch it. He laughed very much over the hat, still more uproariously  over the broken glass, but the blood on the sword point sent him  into mortal convulsions of amusement. Then he turned to the fuming  specialist.    \"Dr Hood,\" he cried enthusiastically, \"you are a great poet! You have  called an uncreated being out of the void. How much more godlike that is  than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts! Indeed, the mere facts  are rather commonplace and comic by comparison.\"    \"I have no notion what you are talking about,\" said Dr Hood rather  haughtily; \"my facts are all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete.  A place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps (or poetry if you prefer  the term), but only because the corresponding details cannot as yet be  ascertained. In the absence of Mr Glass--\"    \"That's it, that's it,\" said the little priest, nodding quite eagerly,  \"that's the first idea to get fixed; the absence of Mr Glass. He is so  extremely absent. I suppose,\" he added reflectively, \"that there was  never anybody so absent as Mr Glass.\"    \"Do you mean he is absent from the town?\" demanded the doctor.    \"I mean he is absent from everywhere,\" answered Father Brown; \"he is  absent from the Nature of Things, so to speak.\"    \"Do you seriously mean,\" said the specialist with a smile, \"that there  is no such person?\"    The priest made a sign of assent. \"It does seem a pity,\" he said.    Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh. \"Well,\" he said, \"before  we go on to the hundred and one other evidences, let us take the first  proof we found; the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room.  If there is no Mr Glass, whose hat is this?\"    \"It is Mr Todhunter's,\" replied Father Brown.    \"But it doesn't fit him,\" cried Hood impatiently. \"He couldn't possibly  wear it!\"    Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness. \"I never said he  could wear it,\" he answered. \"I said it was his hat. Or, if you insist  on a shade of difference, a hat that is his.\"    \"And what is the shade of difference?\" asked the criminologist with a  slight sneer.    \"My good sir,\" cried the mild little man, with his first movement akin  to impatience, \"if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatter's  shop, you will see that there is, in common speech, a difference between  a man's hat and the hats that are his.\"    \"But a hatter,\" protested Hood, \"can get money out of his stock of new  hats. What could Todhunter get out of this one old hat?\"    \"Rabbits,\" replied Father Brown promptly.    \"What?\" cried Dr Hood.    \"Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, goldfish, rolls of coloured paper,\" said  the reverend gentleman with rapidity. \"Didn't you see it all when  you found out the faked ropes? It's just the same with the sword.  Mr Todhunter hasn't got a scratch on him, as you say; but he's got a  scratch in him, if you follow me.\"    \"Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes?\" inquired Mrs MacNab  sternly.    \"I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes,\" said Father Brown. \"I  mean inside Mr Todhunter.\"    \"Well, what in the name of Bedlam do you mean?\"    \"Mr Todhunter,\" explained Father Brown placidly, \"is learning to be a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States.

At her helm stood  John Gallop, a sturdy colonist, and a skilful seaman, who earned his  bread by trading with the Indians that at that time thronged the  shores of the Sound, and eagerly seized any opportunity to traffic  with the white men from the colonies of Plymouth or New Amsterdam. The  colonists sent out beads, knives, bright clothes, and sometimes,  unfortunately, rum and other strong drinks. The Indians in exchange  offered skins and peltries of all kinds; and, as their simple natures  had not been schooled to nice calculations of values, the traffic was  one of great profit to the more shrewd whites. But the trade was not  without its perils. Though the Indians were simple, and little likely  to drive hard bargains, yet they were savages, and little accustomed  to nice distinctions between their own property and that of others.  Their desires once aroused for some gaudy bit of cloth or shining  glass, they were ready enough to steal it, often making their booty  secure by the murder of the luckless trader. It so happened, that,  just before John Gallop set out with his sloop on the spring trading  cruise, the people of the colony were excitedly discussing the  probable fate of one Oldham, who some weeks before had set out on a  like errand, in a pinnace, with a crew of two white boys and two  Indians, and had never returned. So when, on this May morning, Gallop,  being forced to hug the shore by stormy weather, saw a small vessel  lying at anchor in a cove, he immediately ran down nearer, to  investigate. The crew of the sloop numbered two men and two boys,  beside the skipper, Gallop. Some heavy duck-guns on board were no mean  ordnance; and the New Englander determined to probe the mystery of  Oldham's disappearance, though it might require some fighting. As the  sloop bore down upon the anchored pinnace, Gallop found no lack of  signs to arouse his suspicion. The rigging of the strange craft was  loose, and seemed to have been cut. No lookout was visible, and she  seemed to have been deserted; but a nearer view showed, lying on the  deck of the pinnace, fourteen stalwart Indians, one of whom, catching  sight of the approaching sloop, cut the anchor cable, and called to  his companions to awake.    This action on the part of the Indians left Gallop no doubt as to  their character. Evidently they had captured the pinnace, and had  either murdered Oldham, or even then had him a prisoner in their  midst. The daring sailor wasted no time in debate as to the proper  course to pursue, but clapping all sail on his craft, soon brought her  alongside the pinnace. As the sloop came up, the Indians opened the  fight with fire-arms and spears; but Gallop's crew responded with  their duck-guns with such vigor that the Indians deserted the decks,  and fled below for shelter. Gallop was then in a quandary. The odds  against him were too great for him to dare to board, and the pinnace  was rapidly drifting ashore. After some deliberation he put up his  helm, and beat to windward of the pinnace; then, coming about, came  scudding down upon her before the wind. The two vessels met with a  tremendous shock. The bow of the sloop struck the pinnace fairly  amidships, forcing her over on her beam-ends, until the water poured  into the open hatchway. The affrighted Indians, unused to warfare on  the water, rushed upon deck. Six leaped into the sea, and were  drowned; the rest retreated again into the cabin. Gallop then prepared  to repeat his ramming manoeuvre. This time, to make the blow more  effective, he lashed his anchor to the bow, so that the sharp flukes  protruded; thus extemporizing an iron-clad ram more than two hundred  years before naval men thought of using one. Thus provided, the second  blow of the sloop was more terrible than the first. The sharp fluke of  the anchor crashed through the side of the pinnace, and the two  vessels hung tightly together. Gallop then began to double-load his  duck-guns, and fire through the sides of the pinnace; but, finding  that the enemy was not to be dislodged in this way, he broke his  vessel loose, and again made for the windward, preparatory to a third  blow. As the sloop drew off, four or five more Indians rushed from the  cabin of the pinnace, and leaped overboard but shared the fate of  their predecessors, being far from land. Gallop then came about, and  for the third time bore down upon his adversary. As he drew near, an  Indian appeared on the deck of the pinnace, and with humble gestures  offered to submit. Gallop ran alongside, and taking the man on board,  bound him hand and foot, and placed him in the hold. A second redskin  then begged for quarter; but Gallop, fearing to allow the two wily  savages to be together, cast the second into the sea, where he was  drowned. Gallop then boarded the pinnace. Two Indians were left, who  retreated into a small compartment of the hold, and were left  unmolested. In the cabin was found the mangled body of Mr. Oldham. A  tomahawk had been sunk deep into his skull, and his body was covered  with wounds. The floor of the cabin was littered with portions of the  cargo, which the murderous savages had plundered. Taking all that  remained of value upon his own craft, Gallop cut loose the pinnace;  and she drifted away, to go to pieces on a reef in Narragansett Bay.    This combat is the earliest action upon American waters of which we  have any trustworthy records. The only naval event antedating this was  the expedition from Virginia, under Capt. Samuel Argal, against the  little French settlement of San Sauveur. Indeed, had it not been for  the pirates and the neighboring French settlements, there would be  little in the early history of the American Colonies to attract the  lover of naval history. But about 1645 the buccaneers began to commit  depredations on the high seas, and it became necessary for the  Colonies to take steps for the protection of their commerce. In this  year an eighteen-gun ship from Cambridge, Mass., fell in with a  Barbary pirate of twenty guns, and was hard put to it to escape. And,  as the seventeenth century drew near its close, these pests of the sea  so increased, that evil was sure to befall the peaceful merchantman  that put to sea without due preparation for a fight or two with the  sea robbers.    It was in the low-lying islands of the Gulf of Mexico, that these  predatory gentry--buccaneers, marooners, or pirates--made their  headquarters, and lay in wait for the richly freighted merchantmen in  the West India trade. Men of all nationalities sailed under the \"Jolly  Roger,\"--as the dread black flag with skull and cross-bones was  called,--but chiefly were they"]]]
