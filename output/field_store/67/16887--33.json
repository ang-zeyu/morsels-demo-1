With the aid of heavy crushers and a certain  amount of water the logs are soon reduced to pulp, which then floats  away into sifters, to be eventually rolled out into flat sheets.    An immense amount of this pulp is exported to England in sacks,  and is used for many other purposes besides paper-making.    Another thing which we get from Norway is ice. Most of those huge  blocks of ice which you see in the fishmongers' shops in the summer  have come across the North Sea, and ice-cutting is a very important  business in the winter months. The ice is obtained principally from the  mountain lakes, and in the vicinity of Christiania long wooden chutes  are erected from the mountain-tops to the edge of the fjord. Down  these the huge cubes travel, direct from their homes to the deck of  the boat, and thus save the cost of overland transport. They are sawn  most carefully, the dimensions being about two feet each way; rope  handles are then frozen into the blocks for facility of movement,  and the cubes are stored in ice-houses until the summer, by which  time they have lost almost half their original weight.    Next to timber, the chief export from the country is fish (including  cod-liver oil). The great fisheries are round the Lofoedden Islands  on the North-West Coast, well within the Arctic Circle, and it  is estimated that some 30,000 men and 6,000 boats are engaged in  capturing the cod from January to April each year. The fishermen  assemble from far and wide, and take up their residence for the  season in temporary huts, clustered together on the shores of the  islands. The work is arduous as well as dangerous, for storms and  heavy seas are of frequent occurrence, and tides and currents among  the islands most treacherous. And here, close to the fisheries,  is situated the dreaded whirlpool, the Maelstrom of renown.    But it is the people's living, and in a favourable season they make  immense hauls. An ordinary catch for an ordinary day is 500 cod per  boat, and a good day will double that number, though in such a case  the boat has to make a second trip to bring the fish ashore. A simple  calculation will show that millions of cod are landed on the islands  every day. Imagine the sight and imagine the smell!    The fish are split open and, after the roe and the liver have  been removed, hung up on hurdles to dry. Some are sold to the  fishing-smacks, which come to the islands to buy the fresh fish, and  then salt it down in barrels, or take it away to dry elsewhere. Scores  of bundles of dried cod, looking like slips of leather, may be seen  for the remainder of the year on every wharf in Norway. Who eats it  all is a mystery; but it goes to England and Spain in large quantities,  and most of us have eaten it on Ash Wednesdays.    Cod's roe and liver are probably of more value than the fish from  which they are extracted, and there are large factories for making  cod-liver oil, not only at the Lofoeddens, but also at other places  on the coast. At Hammerfest, which boasts of being the northernmost  town in the world, the whole air is laden with the nauseous fumes  issuing from the steaming caldrons of boiling cod-liver oil.    The fish trade of Norway is not, however, confined to cod and the  Lofoedden Isles, for in many other parts fishing is the chief industry  of the people, and hundreds of thousands of barrels of salted herrings  and sprats leave the country every year, while sardines and anchovies  are tinned or potted in the factories at Stavanger and other large  seaports. The salmon, also, for which the Norwegian rivers are famous,  are brought over to England packed in ice, and well repay the owners  of the rivers.    Even in the depth of winter a good deal of sea fishing goes on through  the ice of the frozen fjords. The fisherman erects a shelter of some  kind to protect him from the biting wind, and within view of this he  breaks two or three holes in the thick ice. In each hole his baited  hooks are dropped down, the other end of the line being fastened  to a simple contrivance of pieces of stick, which begin to waggle  when a fish is hooked. On the Christiania Fjord numbers of these  sporting fishermen are to be seen at work all through the winter,  and judging by the frequency of their visits to their different holes,  they must take a quantity of fish. It is cold work, however, sitting  and watching for the signal to come from the hole, and one cannot  help admiring the men's energy and keenness.    It is only natural that, living in a country where fish is so  plentiful, the people themselves should be great fish-eaters, and  the daily fish-markets at Bergen and other places on the coast are  most interesting sights. As a rule the fish are brought to market  alive in half-sunken canoes, towed astern of the fishing-boats,  and at Bergen all the bargaining is done between the buyers on the  quayside and the sellers in their boats.    In proportion to the population the variety of occupations in Norway is  certainly great, and there are other industries besides those already  mentioned. There is, for example, a considerable trade in skins  and furs, in condensed milk, butter, and margarine, and in certain  minerals and chemicals. Employment is found also for many men on the  railways--in road-making, in boat and shipbuilding, in timber-dressing,  in mechanical engineering, in slate-quarrying, in stone-cutting,  and in mining (principally in the silver mines at Koengsberg).    It would seem, therefore, as if there were plenty of work for the  Norwegians to do, and they are willing workers. Abject poverty, as  we know the term, has no place in Norway at present, for the country  can support its people, thanks, perhaps, to the fact that the desire  to emigrate to America and Canada is strong.            CHAPTER IV    ON THE FARM      Norway is not like England, where nearly every bit of ground is  cultivated, for nothing will grow on bare rocks, and a good deal of  Norway is barren land. In fact, except in the low country down in the  south, the only land worth cultivating lies, as a rule, in the valleys  near the fjords. There are situated all the farms, sometimes with small  orchards of apples and cherries, but more often with potato plots,  a little corn, and a great amount of grassland. As the mountains  are always so close at hand, the fields are generally strewn with  rocks and boulders, and are very uneven, so haymaking is not easy,  and such a thing as a mowing-machine would be quite useless.    Every blade of grass that can be gathered has to be made into hay,  otherwise the ponies and cows would starve in the winter, as they  are often snowed up for weeks at a time. Haymaking is, therefore, a  great business, and the amount of grass which the Norwegians contrive  to scrape off their land is marvellous. At the best of times it only  grows to a height of about six inches, but scythes and reaping-hooks  find their way into every nook and corner, and grass that no English  farmer would trouble to cut is all raked in with the greatest  care. Parties go up the mountain-sides to ledges of the cliffs, and  on to the tops of the mountains, to make sure that nothing is wasted,  the grass being brought down to the farms to be dried.    Long wires may be seen stretching from the valleys away up, thousands  of feet, to the tops of the mountains, and on these the bundles of  grass are tied, to come swirling down to the farmstead. There is no  time in the short Northern summer to make the hay as we make it, and  there is usually so much rain that the grass would never dry at all  if left lying on the ground; so long hurdles are put up in positions  where they will catch the sun and the wind, and on them the grass  is hung up to dry, there remaining until it has made itself into  hay. Afterwards it is stored in covered barns ready for winter use.    The corn, also, is dried in a peculiar manner. As it is cut it is made  up into small sheaves, a number of these being tied, ears downwards,  to a pole planted upright in the ground. This makes drying rapid,  and, if wet weather sets in, the rain runs off freely. A field of  these wheat-stacks has a very odd appearance at a little distance,  and near the woods one sees similar, though somewhat larger, stacks  of branches and leaves, on which the goats are fed in the winter.    Directly the snow has melted off the mountains the flocks and herds  are sent up to the highland pastures (saeters), usually in charge of the  younger women and girls of the farm, and there, throughout the summer,  the dairy work is carried on. As in all mountainous countries, rich  and sweet herbage follows the melting of the snow, and the cows and  goats give an abundance of good milk, which is turned into butter and  cheese, to be sold or consumed in the winter. Life at the saeter-hut,  or mountain farm, is healthy and delightful, though much hard work  has to be got through each day.    Children seldom go to the saeters until old enough to be able to do  real work, but one often sees a girl of fourteen or so looking after  a flock of goats. She will be out with them all day as they feed  on the mountain-sides, and will do all the milking. When seen for  the first time this is rather an amusing operation, and decidedly a  practical one. The milkmaid seizes a goat, straddles her, with face  towards the goat's tail, and, stooping down, proceeds to milk. From  a little distance all you see is the goat's hind-legs emerging from  beneath a blue petticoat, which looks most peculiar.    But the children who are too young to spend the summer at the saeters  find plenty to do at home, and they learn almost as soon as they  can toddle that there is work for everyone. Quite small boys and  girls manage to do a good day's haymaking, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24681"],[0,"Opportunities in Engineering (#3)"],[1,"istaken. Rough, rugged, gray-eyed; with frames close-knit and  usually squat; generous with money, and unconcerned as to the future;  living each day regardless of the next, and _living_ it--steel-workers  are as distinct from the clerical type--slender, tall, a bit  self-conscious, fearful of themselves and of the future--I say, the  steel-worker is as different from the clerical worker as the  circus-driver is from the cleric. Their work marks them for its own, if  a man lack it upon entering the work, just as the school-room marks the  teacher in time for its own. The thing is not to be mistaken.    The successful engineer must be possessed of a certain fondness for  figures. The subject of mathematics must interest him. He must like to  figure, to use a colloquialism, and his fondness for it must be  genuine, almost an absorption. It must reveal itself to him at an early  age, too, as early as his grammar-school days, for then it will be known  as genuinely a part of him, and the outcropping of seeds correctly sown  by his ancestors. Having this fondness for mathematics, which may be  termed otherwise as a curiosity to make concrete ends meet--the working  out of puzzles is one evidence of the gift--the young man is well armed  for a successful career in the profession. He will like mathematics for  its own sake, and when, later, in college, and later still, in the  active pursuit of his chosen work, he is confronted with a difficult  problem covering strains or stress in a beam or lever or connecting-rod,  he will attack it eagerly, instead of--as I have seen such problems  attacked more than once--irritably and with marked mental effort.    The successful engineer must be a man who likes to shape things with his  hands. He need not always do it, and probably will not after he has  attained to recognition, save only as he supervises or makes the  mechanical drawings--the picture--of the thing. But the itch must be  present in the man. And, like the desire within him to figure, it must  make itself manifest within him early in life. If a young man be of  those who early like to crawl in under the family buzz-wagon; tinker  there for half a day at a time; emerge in a thick coating of grease and  dust and with joy in his eye--such a young man has the necessary  qualifications for a successful engineer. He may never do this--as I  say--in all his engineering career. But the yearning must be as much a  part of him as his love for mathematics--so much so that all his  engineering days he will feel something akin to envy for the machinist  who works over a machine of the engineer's own devising--and it must be  vitally a part of him. To illustrate:    When only twelve years old the author, in company with several  playmates, decided one November day to build an ice-boat. From the  numerous building operations going on in the neighborhood, in the light  of the moon, he secured the necessary timbers, and from a neighbor's  back yard--also in the light of the moon--he got a young sapling which  served delightfully as a mainmast. With the needed materials all  gathered, it suddenly struck him that a plan of some kind ought to be  made of the proposed ice-boat, in order to guard against grave errors  in construction. To think was to act with this bright youngster. He got  him his mother's bread-board and a pencil and an ordinary school ruler,  and with these made a drawing of the ice-boat as he thought the boat  should be. Knowing nothing of mechanical drawing, and but very little of  construction of any kind, he nevertheless devised a pretty fair-looking  boat and not a bad working drawing. One of his playmates, whose father  was something or other in a manufacturing-plant, showed the drawing to  the family circle; with the result that the kid's father, laying a rule  upon the drawing, pronounced it an accurate mechanical drawing, drawn to  scale--which was one inch to the foot--and sent for the youthful  designer, meaning me.    \"What do you know about mechanical drawings?\" he asked the bashful  youngster, pointing to the drawing under discussion.    \"I don't know nothing about it,\" replied the kid--meaning me again. \"I  just made it with a ruler.\"    \"But how come you made it to scale? That drawing is a complete plan and  elevation of an ice-boat, drawn accurately to scale.\" He looked  thoughtful. \"I don't understand it. You ought to take up with drafting,  my boy, when you get a little older. I never knew of a case like it.  What does your father do?\" he suddenly asked.    \"He's an ice-dealer,\"[1] replied the discomfited boy. \"I just made  it--that's all. We need it, too, to go ahead.\" Turning to his playmate,  \"Come on out, Jack; the gang is waiting.\"    Which terminated the interview.    Yet the thing was the beginning of a career for the boy. The boat in  time somehow got itself built and out upon the little river; but owing  to the fact that its materials were stolen, the river failed to freeze  over that winter, and for three winters following--not till the boat  itself had fallen apart from disuse and lack of care--which points its  own moral, as hinted at above. If you must build ice-boats, and you are  a kid with mechanical yearnings, pay for the material that goes into the  making of your product. But the thing--as I say--was the beginning of a  career for the lad. In time, through the kindly office of his playmate's  father, he became apprenticed in a drafting-room of a large  manufacturing-plant--and the rest was easy. In his first year, on paper,  he devised a steam-engine with novel arrangement of slide-valves, and  thereafter for years designed engines and machinery about the country,  always quite successfully.    The successful engineer, while possessed of certain spiritual  characteristics, must also--if I may be so bold as to say so--be  possessed of certain physical characteristics. One of these is large,  and what is known as capable, hands. Short, spatulate fingers, with a  broad palm, appear to be a feature of the successful engineer. Of  course, there are exceptions, as there are exceptions to every rule, but  in the majority of cases which have come under the writer's observation  the successful engineer has had hands of this shaping. He likewise has  had wrists and arms to match with such hands, and--in the practical  engineer--that is, the engineer whose particular gift is coping with  ordinary problems of construction, as against the genius who blazes new  trails, like Watt and Westinghouse and Edison and Marconi and the Wright  brothers--a head whose contour was along the \"well-shaped\" lines. The  so-called genius usually has an odd-shaped head, I've noticed, but for  purposes of this book we shall confine ourselves to the average  successful man in engineering.    Thus you have, roughly, the engineering type. I have sketched only the  major characteristics. The minor characteristics embrace many features.  There is patience, for one--patience to labor long with difficulties;  concentration, for another; application, for a third; certain student  qualities, for yet a fourth. Many graduate engineers have gone off into  other work immediately after leaving college because of a clearly  defined dislike for detail in construction. The average successful  engineer will be a man interested in the shaping of the details of his  machine or bridge or plant. To many, details are irksome. If the young  man who is reading this book knows that he dislikes a detail of any  character whatsoever, unless he be possessed of the creative genius of a  Westinghouse or an Edison, he would better take up with some other  profession. For engineering, in the last analysis, is the manipulating  of detailed parts into a perfect whole--whether it be a bridge or a  machine or a plant.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] The boy's father always wanted to be a carpenter.          IV    THE FOUR MAJOR BRANCHES      The four major branches of engineering are civil, mechanical,  electrical, and mining. I give them in the order of their acceptance  among engineers. Each is separate from each of the others, and each is a  profession in itself, and as distinctive from each of the others as is  the allopathic from the homeopathic among men of medicine, though not  with quite the same distinction. Whereas the several groups of  physicians seek to relieve pain and correct disorder by way of  diversified channels, the several groups of engineers each work in a  field of endeavor actively apart from each of the other groups.  Sometimes one group will lap over upon another group, in certain kinds  of construction work, but even then the branches will hold sharply each  to its own.    Civil engineering embraces, roughly, all work in the soil. The surveyor  is a civil engineer. He constructs dams, builds viaducts, lays out  railroads, and in the war, where he was known as a pioneer, he was  responsible for all tunneling and trench projects, besides keeping the  highways clear and the wire entanglements intact. Civil engineering is a  profession which keeps its followers pretty well out in the open. A  civil engineer will go long distances, and frequently must, in order to  get to his work, and, having reached the scene of his labors, enters  upon a rugged outdoor life in camp where he remains until the job is  completed. The Panama Canal was a civil-engineering job--probably the  largest of its kind ever undertaken--and its success, after failure on  the part of another government, is a high tribute to the genius of our  own civil engineers.    Mechanical engineering is a profession whose medium of endeavor lies in  the metals. Mechanical engineers shape things out of iron or steel or  brass or other metal compositions, and put these things into engines or  machines for service. All machinery, whether it be printing-presses or  automobiles or steam-engines, is the work of mechanical engineers,  though in the matter of automobiles this has"]]]
