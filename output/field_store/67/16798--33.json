A Lion and a Bull, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#3)"],[1," worthy  descendant of Titans--said in later years, \"Timeo Danaos et dona  ferentes,\"--\"I fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts.\" And  Prometheus, the greatly-daring, knowing that he merited the anger of  the gods, saw treachery in a gift outwardly so perfect. Not only would  he not accept this exquisite creature for his own, but he hastened to  caution his brother also to refuse her.    But well were they named Prometheus (Forethought) and Epimethus  (Afterthought). For Epimethus it was enough to look at this peerless  woman, sent from the gods, for him to love her and to believe in her  utterly. She was the fairest thing on earth, worthy indeed of the  deathless gods who had created her. Perfect, too, was the happiness  that she brought with her to Epimethus. Before her coming, as he well  knew now, the fair world had been incomplete. Since she came the  fragrant flowers had grown more sweet for him, the song of the birds  more full of melody. He found new life in Pandora and marvelled how  his brother could ever have fancied that she could bring to the world  aught but peace and joyousness.    Now when the gods had entrusted to the Titan brothers the endowment of  all living things upon the earth, they had been careful to withhold  everything that might bring into the world pain, sickness, anxiety,  bitterness of heart, remorse, or soul-crushing sorrow. All these  hurtful things were imprisoned in a coffer which was given into the  care of the trusty Epimethus.    To Pandora the world into which she came was all fresh, all new, quite  full of unexpected joys and delightful surprises. It was a world of  mystery, but mystery of which her great, adoring, simple Titan held  the golden key. When she saw the coffer which never was opened, what  then more natural than that she should ask Epimethus what it  contained? But the contents were known only to the gods. Epimethus was  unable to answer. Day by day, the curiosity of Pandora increased. To  her the gods had never given anything but good. Surely there must be  here gifts more precious still. What if the Olympians had destined her  to be the one to open the casket, and had sent her to earth in order  that she might bestow on this dear world, on the men who lived on it,  and on her own magnificent Titan, happiness and blessings which only  the minds of gods could have conceived? Thus did there come a day when  Pandora, unconscious instrument in the hands of a vengeful Olympian,  in all faith, and with the courage that is born of faith and of love,  opened the lid of the prison-house of evil. And as from coffers in the  old Egyptian tombs, the live plague can still rush forth and slay, the  long-imprisoned evils rushed forth upon the fair earth and on the  human beings who lived on it--malignant, ruthless, fierce,  treacherous, and cruel--poisoning, slaying, devouring. Plague and  pestilence and murder, envy and malice and revenge and all  viciousness--an ugly wolf-pack indeed was that one let loose by  Pandora. Terror, doubt, misery, had all rushed straightway to attack  her heart, while the evils of which she had never dreamed stung mind  and soul into dismay and horror, when, by hastily shutting the lid of  the coffer, she tried to undo the evil she had done.    And lo, she found that the gods had imprisoned one good gift only in  this Inferno of horrors and of ugliness. In the world there had never  been any need of Hope. What work was there for Hope to do where all  was perfect, and where each creature possessed the desire of body and  of heart? Therefore Hope was thrust into the chest that held the  evils, a star in a black night, a lily growing on a dung-heap. And as  Pandora, white-lipped and trembling, looked into the otherwise empty  box, courage came back to her heart, and Epimethus let fall to his  side the arm that would have slain the woman of his love because there  came to him, like a draught of wine to a warrior spent in battle, an  imperial vision of the sons of men through all the aeons to come,  combatting all evils of body and of soul, going on conquering and to  conquer. Thus, saved by Hope, the Titan and the woman faced the  future, and for them the vengeance of the gods was stayed.                              \"Yet I argue not      Against Heav'n's hand or will, nor bate a jot      Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer      Right onward.\"    So spoke Milton, the blind Titan of the seventeenth century; and  Shakespeare says:        \"True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings;      Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.\"    Upon the earth, and on the children of men who were as gods in their  knowledge and mastery of the force of fire, Jupiter had had his  revenge. For Prometheus he reserved another punishment. He, the  greatly-daring, once the dear friend and companion of Zeus himself,  was chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus by the vindictive deity.  There, on a dizzy height, his body thrust against the sun-baked rock,  Prometheus had to endure the torment of having a foul-beaked vulture  tear out his liver, as though he were a piece of carrion lying on the  mountain side. All day, while the sun mercilessly smote him and the  blue sky turned from red to black before his pain-racked eyes, the  torture went on. Each night, when the filthy bird of prey that worked  the will of the gods spread its dark wings and flew back to its eyrie,  the Titan endured the cruel mercy of having his body grow whole once  more. But with daybreak there came again the silent shadow, the smell  of the unclean thing, and again with fierce beak and talons the  vulture greedily began its work.    Thirty thousand years was the time of his sentence, and yet Prometheus  knew that at any moment he could have brought his torment to an end. A  secret was his--a mighty secret, the revelation of which would have  brought him the mercy of Zeus and have reinstated him in the favour of  the all-powerful god. Yet did he prefer to endure his agonies rather  than to free himself by bowing to the desires of a tyrant who had  caused Man to be made, yet denied to Man those gifts that made him  nobler than the beasts and raised him almost to the heights of the  Olympians. Thus for him the weary centuries dragged by--in suffering  that knew no respite--in endurance that the gods might have ended.  Prometheus had brought an imperial gift to the men that he had made,  and imperially he paid the penalty.        \"Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,      And moments aye divided by keen pangs      Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,      Scorn and despair,--these are mine empire.      More glorious far than that which thou surveyest      From thine unenvied throne, O, Mighty God!      Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame      Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here      Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,      Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,      Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.      Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!\"            Shelley.        \"Titan! to whose immortal eyes      The sufferings of mortality      Seen in their sad reality,      Were not as things that gods despise;      What was thy pity's recompense?      A silent suffering, and intense;      The rock, the vulture, and the chain,      All that the proud can feel of pain,      The agony they do not show,      The suffocating sense of woe,      Which speaks but in its loneliness,      And then is jealous lest the sky      Should have a listener, nor will sigh      Until its voice is echoless.\"            Byron.        \"Yet, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown      By years of solitude,--that holds apart      The past and future, giving the soul room      To search into itself,--and long commune      With this eternal silence;--more a god,      In my long-suffering and strength to meet      With equal front the direst shafts of fate,      Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism ...      Therefore, great heart, bear up! thou art but type      Of what all lofty spirits endure that fain      Would win men back to strength and peace through love:      Each hath his lonely peak, and on each heart      Envy, or scorn or hatred tears lifelong      With vulture beak; yet the high soul is left;      And faith, which is but hope grown wise, and love      And patience, which at last shall overcome.\"            Lowell.          PYGMALION      In days when the world was young and when the gods walked on the  earth, there reigned over the island of Cyprus a sculptor-king, and  king of sculptors, named Pygmalion.
