It was, indeed,  the custom among all classes, not only in England but on the Continent,  throughout the Middle Ages. The eminent French antiquary, Paul Lacroix,  speaks of wakes, or evening parties, where fairy tales and other  superstitions were propagated, as having a very ancient origin. He  states that they are still (as we have already seen in Brittany and  Gascony) the custom in most of the French provinces, and that they  formed important events in the private lives of the peasants.[4]    It is difficult to sever the occasion and mode of the tale-telling from  the character of the teller; nor would it be wise to do so. And in this  connection it is interesting to pause for a moment on Dr. Pitre's  description of Agatuzza Messia, the old woman from whom he derived so  large a number of the stories in his magnificent collection, and whom he  regarded as a model story-teller. I am tempted to quote his account at  length. \"Anything but beautiful,\" he says, \"she has facile speech,  efficacious phrases, an attractive manner of telling, whence you divine  her extraordinary memory and the sallies of her natural wit. Messia  already reckons her seventy years, and is a mother, grandmother, and  great grandmother. As a child, she was told by her grandmother an  infinity of tales which she had learned from her mother, and _she_ in  turn from her grandfather; she had a good memory and never forgot them.  There are women who have heard hundreds of tales and remember none; and  there are others who, though they remember them, have not the grace of  narration. Among her companions of the Borgo, a quarter of Palermo,  Messia enjoyed the reputation of a fine story-teller; and the more one  heard her, the more one desired to hear. Almost half a century ago she  was obliged to go with her husband to Messina, and lived there some  time: a circumstance, this, worthy of note, since our countrywomen never  go away from their own district save from the gravest necessity.  Returning to her native home, she spoke of things of which the gossips  of the neighbourhood could not speak: she spoke of the Citadel, a  fortress which no one could take, not even the Turks themselves; she  spoke of the Pharos of Messina, which was beautiful, but dangerous for  sailors; she spoke of Reggio in Calabria, which, facing the walls of  Messina, seemed to wish to touch hands with them; and she remembered and  mimicked the pronunciation of the Milazzesi, who spoke, Messia said, so  curiously as to make one laugh. All these reminiscences have remained  most vivid in her memory. She cannot read, but she knows so many things  that no one else knows, and repeats them with a propriety of tongue that  is a pleasure to hear. This is a characteristic to which I call my  readers' attention. If the tale turns upon a vessel which has to make a  voyage, she utters, without remarking it, or without seeming to do so,  sailors' phrases, and words which only seamen and those who have to do  with seamen are acquainted with. If the heroine arrives, poor and  desolate, at a baker's and takes a place there, Messia's language is so  completely that of the trade that you would believe that the baking of  bread had been her business, whereas at Palermo this occupation, an  ordinary one in the families of the large and small communes of the  island, is that of professional bakers alone.... As a young woman Messia  was a tailoress; when through toil her sight became weakened, she turned  to sewing winter quilts. But in the midst of this work, whereby she  earns her living, she finds time for the fulfilment of her religious  duties; every day, winter and summer, in rain or snow, in the gloaming  she goes to her prayers. Whatever feast is celebrated in the church, she  is solicitous to attend: Monday, she is at the Ponte dell' Ammiraglio  praying for the Souls of the Beheaded; Wednesday, you find her at San  Giuseppe keeping the festival of the Madonna della Providenza; every  Friday she goes to San Francesco di Paola, reciting by the way her  accustomed beads; and if one Saturday pass when she ought to go to the  Madonna dei Cappuccini, another does not; and there she prays with a  devotion which none can understand who has not experienced it. Messia  witnessed my birth and held me in her arms: hence I have been able to  collect from her mouth the many and beautiful traditions to which her  name is appended. She has repeated to the grown man the tales she had  told to the child thirty years before; nor has her narration lost a  shade of the old sincerity, vivacity, and grace. The reader will only  find the cold and naked words; but Messia's narration consists, more  than in words, in the restless movement of the eyes, in the waving of  the arms, in the gestures of the whole person, which rises, walks around  the room, bends, and is again uplifted, making her voice now soft, now  excited, now fearful, now sweet, now hoarse, as it portrays the voices  of the various personages, and the action which these are  performing.\"[5]    Such a woman as is here described is a born story-teller; and her art,  as exhibited in the tales attributed to her in Dr. Pitre's collection,  reaches perhaps the highest point possible in tradition. Women are  usually the best narrators of nursery tales. Most of the modern  collections, from that of the brothers Grimm downwards, owe their  choicest treasures to women. In the Panjab, however, Captain Temple  ascribes to children marvellous power of telling tales, which he states  they are not slow to exercise after sunset, when the scanty evening meal  is done and they huddle together in their little beds beneath the  twinkling stars, while the hot air cools, the mosquito sings, and the  village dogs bark at imaginary foes. The Rev. Hinton Knowles' collection  was gathered in Cashmere apparently from men and boys only; but all  classes contributed, from the governor and the pandit down to the barber  and the day-labourer, the only qualification being that they should be  entirely free from European influence.[6]    But nursery tales told simply for amusement are far from being the only  kind of traditional narrative. Savage and barbarous races, to whom the  art of writing is unknown, are dependent upon memory for such records as  they have of their past; and sometimes a professional class arises to  preserve and repeat the stories believed to embody these records. Among  the Maories and their Polynesian kinsmen the priests are the great  depositaries of tradition. It is principally from them that Mr. White  and the Rev. W. W. Gill have obtained their collections. But the orators  and chiefs are also fully conversant with the narratives; and their  speeches are filled with allusions to them, and with quotations from  ancient poems relating the deeds of their forefathers. The difficulty of  following such allusions, and consequently of understanding the meaning  of the chiefs when addressing him on behalf of their fellow-countrymen,  first induced, or compelled, Sir George Grey, when Governor of New  Zealand, to make the inquiries whose results are embodied in his work on  Polynesian Mythology. The Eskimo of Greenland, at the other end of the  world, divide their tales into two classes: the ancient and the modern.  The former may be considered, Dr. Rink says, as more or less the  property of the whole nation, while the latter are limited to certain  parts of the country, or even to certain people who claim to be akin to  one another. The art of telling these tales is \"practised by certain  persons specially gifted in this respect; and among a hundred people  there may generally be found one or two particularly favoured with the  art of the _raconteur_, besides several tolerable narrators.\" It is the  narrators of the ancient tales \"who compose the more recent stories by  picking up the occurrences and adventures of their latest ancestors,  handed down occasionally by some old members of the family, and  connecting and embellishing them by a large addition of the  supernatural, for which purpose resort is always had to the same  traditional and mystic elements of the ancient folklore.\"[7]    But the art of story-telling has not everywhere given rise to a  professional class. When the Malagasy receive friends at their houses,  they themselves recount the deeds of their ancestors, which are handed  down from father to son, and form the principal topic of conversation.  So, too, the savage Ahts of Vancouver Island sit round their fires  singing and chatting; \"and the older men, we are told, lying and  bragging after the manner of story-tellers, recount their feats in war,  or the chase, to a listening group.\" Mr. Im Thurn has drawn an  interesting picture of the habits at night of the Indian tribes of  Guiana. The men, if at home, spend the greater part of the day in their  hammocks, smoking, \"and leisurely fashioning arrowheads, or some such  articles of use or of ornament.... When the day has at last come to an  end, and the women have gathered together enough wood for the fires  during the night, they, too, throw themselves into their hammocks; and  all talk together. Till far into the night the men tell endless stories,  sometimes droning them out in a sort of monotonous chant, sometimes  delivering them with a startling amount of emphasis and gesticulation.  The boys and younger men add to the noise by marching round the houses,  blowing horns and playing on flutes. There is but little rest to be  obtained in an Indian settlement by night. These people sleep, as dogs  do, without difficulty, for brief periods, but frequently and  indifferently by day or night as may be convenient. The men, having  slept at intervals during the day, do not need night-rest; the women are  not considered in the matter. At last, in the very middle of their  stories, the party drops off to sleep; and all is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24616"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Southwark Cathedral (#3)"],[1,"ions, to be  followed three years later by the \"voluntary surrender\" of their  property by the larger monasteries, thus making a clean sweep of the  whole. The last Prior, Linstede, has been blamed for so far  acquiescing in the measure as to accept a pension from the royal  bounty; but with the fate of the last Abbot of Glastonbury before him,  who had been hanged for his resistance, he probably thought that his  own opposition would only have led to a useless martyrdom without  averting the fall of his priory. It may be mentioned, as having some  bearing on our history, that part of the wealth released by the Act  was applied to the foundation of six new bishoprics, thus by a strange  coincidence bringing up the English dioceses to the number of  twenty-four, originally fixed upon by Pope Gregory the Great, while  his successor was set at defiance by the measures through which they  were created.    St. Mary Overy now enters on a new phase of existence. We have seen  that it had become a double church, by union with the church, or  chapel, of St. Mary Magdalene, the one a conventual, the other a  public, place of worship. In the immediate neighbourhood there was a  third church, dedicated to St. Margaret, which had been founded by  Bishop Giffard in 1107, and granted to the fraternity at St. Mary's by  charter of Henry I. By an Act of 1540, the year of Linstede's  surrender, the whole were united into a single parish, under the title  of St. Saviour's, thenceforward the official designation of the  Collegiate Church and surrounding district. The new dedication was  suggested by, and intended to perpetuate the memory of, the convent of  that name in Bermondsey (founded by Alwin Child, a London citizen, in  1082), which shared the fate of its companions at the Dissolution.    Soon after the amalgamation, St. Margaret's Church was secularized,  and divided into three portions for use respectively as a Sessions'  Court, a Court of Admiralty, and a prison. It stood on the ground  where the old Southwark Town Hall was afterwards built, itself a  perpetuation of the secular uses to which the deconsecrated church was  put before it was destroyed. A relic of St. Margaret's survives in the  shape of a monumental slab to Aleyn Ferthing, five times Member for  Southwark, about the middle of the fourteenth century. The stone was  discovered in 1833 during some excavations on the site of the old  church, and transferred to St. Saviour's, where it is imbedded in the  pavement of the retro-choir. From 1540 the Priory Church and Rectory  were leased to the parishioners by the Crown, at a rental of about L50  per annum, till 1614, when the church was purchased right out from  James I for the sum of L800.    The Corporation into whose hands the newly constituted parish of St.  Saviour's passed in 1540 consisted of thirty vestrymen, of whom six  were churchwardens.[5]    The latter, as representatives of the ancient _Seniores  Ecclesiastici_, were charged with the protection of the edifice and  church furniture, but the records show that they had no special  veneration for either. The Act of 1540, appointing them to St.  Saviour's, had formed them into a Corporation in continuation of the  _Perpetual Guild or Fraternity of the Assumption_, incorporated in  1449. This Guild was afterwards merged in the Churchwardens of St.  Margaret's, whence the existing officers were transferred to St.  Saviour's on the amalgamation of the parishes, and others added to  their number. With the help of their fellow vestrymen they soon set to  work to render the Collegiate Church more convenient. To secure an  easy communication between that church and the adjacent chapel of St.  Mary Magdalene, they cut through the south wall of the choir, and  constructed four clumsy arches in it, thus opening the way from one  building to the other. From that time forward the smaller of the two  was used as a vestibule, and the other chapels and chantries  pertaining to the larger church were doomed to destruction, as being  no longer required under the altered conditions. The proceedings which  strike us as most sacrilegious occurred in the Lady Chapel. Perhaps  they cannot be better described than in Stow's graphic words:        The chapel was leased and let out, and the House of God made a      bakehouse. Two very fair doors ... were lathed, daubed, and      dammed up, the fair pillars were ordinary posts, against which      they piled billets and bavens. In this place they had their      ovens, in that a bolting place, in that their kneading trough,      in another (I have heard) a hog's trough, for the words that      were given me were these: \"This place have I known a hog-stie,      in another a storehouse to store up their hoarded meal, and in      all of it something of this sordid kind and condition.\"    That the description is not exaggerated is proved by the parish  registers, which also show that the state of things went on for some  years and did not improve with time. On 15th May, 1576, for instance,  a vestry order is recorded in which the lessee of the chapel is called  upon to repair certain broken windows and remove nuisances. In the  following December, a further entry states that fourteen members of  the vestry went in a body to the chapel to see whether their orders  had been attended to, having allowed the lessee more than six months  to act on the notice. They found the place turned into a stable \"with  hogs, a dung-heap and other filth\" about, and were thereupon empowered  to take legal proceedings to keep the tenant up to his contract.[6]    In the reign of Edward VI the Prayer-book and its vernacular services  were introduced. The people had hardly got used to them before the  accession of Queen Mary, and the consequent papal reaction, restored  the Latin mass, around which most of the religious controversies of  the time were furiously raging. During that brief reign the  retro-choir was turned to more respectable use as a Spiritual Court,  though the memories attaching to it in that character constitute a  gloomy chapter in its history which we would gladly eliminate.    On Monday, 28th January, 1555, and the two following days, a  commission, appointed by the Cardinal Legate, sat there for the trial  of certain preachers and heretics. It was presided over by Bishops  Gardiner, of Winchester, and Bonner, of London, and included eleven  other Bishops, besides several eminent laymen. On the first day the  proceedings were open to the public, but as the crowd was  inconvenient, and the example or logic of the accused thought likely  to be contagious, the doors were closed on the Tuesday and Wednesday,  except to a few privileged spectators. The trials ended in the  condemnation of six clergymen of high standing, viz.:    1. The Rev. Lawrence Saunders, Rector of Allhallows', Bread Street.    2. The Rev. John Bradford, Prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral.    3. The Rev. John Rogers, Prebendary of St. Paul's, and Vicar of St.  Sepulchre's, Newgate Street.    4. The Rev. Rowland Taylor, Rector of Hadleigh, Suffolk.    5. The Right Rev. Robert Ferrar, Bishop of St. David's, and    6. The Right Rev. John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, all of whom were  afterwards burnt. They are commemorated in the windows of the chapel,  which include the Ven. John Philpot, Archdeacon of Winchester, who  suffered at the same time, though his examination was held elsewhere.  The odium of this melancholy transaction of course rests on the  presiding Bishops, neither of whom was afterwards anxious to take the  undivided responsibility. Bishop Gardiner did not long survive it. He  died on the 13th November, in the same year, at Whitehall, whence his  body was conveyed, _via_ Southwark, to Winchester for interment. The  funeral procession went by water from Westminster to St. Mary Overy,  where his obsequies were performed, and his intestines buried before  the high altar, in order that the honour of holding his remains might  be shared by the two principal churches in his diocese.[7]    Immediately on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, steps were taken to  reconcile the conflicting elements within the Church of England, whose  extreme representatives had been brought into violent collision in the  previous reign. A compromise was offered to them in a new Prayer-book,  which aimed at combining the principles of the first and second books  of Edward VI, in order to comprehend within the pale of the Church  those who had been excluded from it by a rigid interpretation of the  rubrics on either hand. On one side the rubrics of Edward's second  book were modified so as to allow greater liberty in the use of  ornaments and vestments, while on the other, the sentences employed at  the distribution of the elements in Holy Communion, which had been  held to support two opposite theories of the Sacrament in the previous  books, were united in the new one, as involving no real contradiction.    Notwithstanding the rubric which was inserted in Elizabeth's book for  the retention of the ornaments in use under Edward VI, an order was  issued in the first year of her reign (18th September, 1559), for the  sale of certain \"Popish ornaments\" at St. Saviour's, to meet the  expenses of repairing the church, and in consideration of the purchase  of the new lease. A list of the ornaments so disposed of may be  interesting:        Two small basons of silver, parcel gilt, weighing 22 ounces,      with a salver, double gilt, and a paten, parcel gilt.        Two altar-cloths, and a vestment of black velvet and crimson      satin, embroidered in gold and silver.        A cope and vestment (deacon and sub-deacon) of green velvet,      with flowers of gold.        Three copper cases, 43 pieces of stuff, and 4 \"aules.\"        The whole of which were sold for L14 5_s._ 8_d._    Other articles sold included:        A painted cloth from before the rood, realizing 7_s._        Two altar-cloths "]]]
