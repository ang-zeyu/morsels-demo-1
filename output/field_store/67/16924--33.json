Its walls were thick and they  kept out the wind; and, besides, was it not handy by the suet?    In the spring he liked it for another reason, too--the best reason in  the world. It gave great happiness to Mrs. Chick. \"Fee-bee?\" he had  asked her as he called her attention to it; and \"Fee-bee,\" she had  replied on looking it over. So he said, \"Chick, D.D.\" in delight, and  then perched near by, while he warbled cosily a brief song jumbled full  of joy.    Chick and his mate had indeed chosen well, for it is a poor wall that  will not work both ways. If the sides of the hollow post had been thick  enough to keep out the coldest of the winter cold, they were also thick  enough to keep out the hottest of the summer heat. If they kept out the  wet of the driving storm, they held enough of the old-wood moisture  within so that the room did not get too dry. Of course, it needed a  little repair. But, then, what greater fun than putting improvements  into a home? Especially when it can be done by the family, without  expense!    So Mr. and Mrs. Chick fell to work right cheerily, and dug the hole  deeper with their beaks. They didn't leave the chips on the ground  before their doorway, either. They took them off to some distance, and  had no heap near by, as a sign to say, \"A bird lives here.\" For,  sociable as they were all winter, they wanted quiet and seclusion within  the walls of their own home.    And such a home it was! After it had been hollowed to a suitable depth,  Chick had brought in a tuft of white hair that a rabbit had left among  the brambles. Mrs. Chick had found some last year's thistle-down and  some this year's poplar cotton, and a horse-hair from the lane. Then  Chick had picked up a gay feather that had floated down from a scarlet  bird that sang in the tree-tops, and tore off silk from a cocoon. So,  bit by bit, they gathered their treasures, until many a woodland and  meadow creature and plant had had a share in the softness of a nest  worthy of eight dear white eggs with reddish-brown spots upon them. It  was such a soft nest, in fact, with such dear eggs in it, that Chick  brooded there cosily himself part of the time, and was happy to bring  food to his mate when she took her turn.    In eleven or twelve days from the time the eggs were laid, there were  ten birds in that home instead of two. The fortnight that followed was  too busy for song. Chick and his mate looked the orchard over even more  thoroughly than the Farmer Boy did; and before those eight hungry babies  of theirs were ready to leave the nest, it began to seem as if Chick had  eaten too many insect eggs in the spring, there were so few caterpillars  hatching out. But the fewer there were, the harder they hunted; and the  harder they hunted, the scarcer became the caterpillars. So when Dee,  Chee, Fee, Wee, Lee, Bee, Mee, and Zee were two weeks old, and came out  of the hollow post to seek their own living, the whole family had to  take to the birches until a new crop of insect eggs had been laid in the  orchard. This was no hardship. It only added the zest of travel and  adventure to the pleasure of the days. Besides, it isn't just orchards  that Chick, D.D. and his kind take care of. It is forests and  shade-trees, too.    Hither and yon they hopped and flitted, picking the weevils out of the  dead tips of the growing pine trees, serving the beech trees such a good  turn that the beechnut crop was the heavier for their visit, doing a bit  for the maple-sugar trees, and so on through the woodland.    Not only did they mount midget guard over the mighty trees, but they  acted as pilots to hungry birds less skillful than themselves in finding  the best feeding-places. \"Chick, D.D.D.D.D.,\" they called in  thanksgiving, as they found great plenty; and warblers and kinglets and  creepers and many a bird beside knew the sound, and gathered there to  share the bountiful feast that Chick, D.D. had discovered.    The gorgeous autumn came, the brighter, by the way, for the leaves that  Chick had saved. The Bob-o-links, in traveling suits, had already left  for the prairies of Brazil and Paraguay, by way of Florida and Jamaica.  The strange honk of geese floated down from V-shaped flocks, as if they  were calling, \"Southward Ho!\" The red-winged blackbirds gave a wonderful  farewell chorus. Flock by flock and kind by kind, the migrating birds  departed.    _WHY?_    Well, never ask Chick, D.D. The north with its snows is good enough for  him. Warblers may go and nuthatches may come. 'Tis all one to Chick. He  is not a bird to follow fashions others set.    This bird-of-the-happy-heart has courage to meet the coldest day with a  joyous note of welcome. The winter is cheerier for his song. And, as you  have guessed, it is not by word alone that he renders service. The trees  of the north are the healthier for his presence. Because of him, the  purse of man is fatter, and his larder better stocked. He has done no  harm as harm is counted in the world he lives in. It is written in books  that, in all the years, not one crime, not even one bad habit, is known  of any bird who has called himself \"Chick, D.D.\"    Because the world is always better for his living in it; and because no  one can watch the black-capped sprite without catching, for a moment at  least, a message of cheer and courage and service, does he not name  himself rightly a minister?    Yes, surely, the little parson who dwells in the heart of Christmas-tree  Land has a right to his \"D.D.,\" even though he did not earn it in a  college of men.          II    THE FIVE WORLDS OF LARIE      Larie was all alone in a little world. He had lived there many days, and  had spent the time, minute by minute and hour by hour, doing nothing at  all but growing. That one thing he had done well. There is no doubt  about that; for he had grown from a one-celled little beginning of life  into a creature so big that he filled the whole of his world crammed  full. It was smooth, and it was hard, and its sides were curved around  and about him so tightly that he could not even stretch his legs. There  was no door. Larie was a prisoner. The prison-walls of his world held  him so fast that he could not budge. That is, he could not budge  anything but his head. He could move that a little.    Now, that is what we might call being in a fairly tight place. But you  don't know Larie if you think he could not get out of it. There are few  places so tight that we can't get out of them if we go about it the  right way, and make the best of what power we have. That is just what  Larie did. He had power to move his head enough to tap, with his beak,  against the wall of his world that had become his prison. So he kept  tapping with his beak. On the end of it was a queer little knob. With  this he knocked against the hard smooth wall.    \"Tap! tip tip!\" went Larie's knob. Then he would rest, for it is not  easy work hammering and pounding, all squeezed in so tight. But he kept  at it again and again and again. And then at last he cracked his  prison-wall; and lo, it was not a very thick wall after all! No thicker  than an eggshell!    That is the way with many difficulties. They seem so very hard at first,  and so very hopeless, and then end by being only a way to something  very, very pleasant.    So here was Larie in his second world. Its thin, soft floor and its  thick, soft sides were made of fine bright-green grass, which had turned  yellowish in drying. It had no roof. The sun shone in at the top. The  wind blew over. There had been no sun or wind in his eggshell world. It  was comfortable to have them now. They dried his down and made it  fluffy. There was plenty of room for its fluffiness. He could stretch  his legs, too, and could wiggle his wings against his sides. This felt  good. And he could move his head all he cared to. But he did not begin  thumping the sides of his new world with it. He tucked it down between  two warm little things close by, and went to sleep. The two warm little  things were his sister and brother, for Larie was not alone in his  nest-world.    The sun went down and the wind blew cold and the rain beat hard from the  east; but Larie knew nothing of all this. A roof had settled down over  his world while he napped. It was white as sea foam, and soft and dry  and, oh, so very cosy, as it spread over him. The roof to Larie's second  world was his mother's breast.    The storm and the night passed, and the sun and the fresh spring breeze  again came in at the top of the nest. Then something very big stood near  and made a shadow, and Larie heard a strange sound. The something very  big was his mother, and the strange sound was her first call to  breakfast. When Larie heard that, he opened his mouth. But nothing went  into it. His brother and sister were being fed. He had never had any  food in his mouth in all the days of his life. To be sure, his egg-world  was filled with nourishment that he had taken into his body and had used  in growing; but he had never done anything with his beak except to knock  with the knob at the end of it against the shell when he pipped his way  out. What a handy little knob that had been--just right for tapping.  But, now that there was no hard wall about him to break, what should he  use it for? Well, nothing at all; for the joke of it is, there was no  knob there. It had dropped off, and he could never have another.    Never mind: he could open his beak just as well without it; and  by-and-by his mother came again with a second call for breakfast, and  that time Larie got his share. After that, there were calls for luncheon  and for dinner, and luncheon again between that and supper; and part of  the calls were from Mother and part from Father Gull.    Larie's second world, it seems, was a place where he and his brother and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25609"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#3)"],[1,"smiled and stuck to play.        And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,      And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.        My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair      And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.        I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,      No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.        But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,      And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.          ESCAPE AT BEDTIME          The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out        Through the blinds and the windows and bars;      And high overhead and all moving about,        There were thousands of millions of stars.      There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,        Nor of people in church or the Park,      As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,        And that glittered and winked in the dark.        The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,        And the star of the sailor, and Mars,      These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall        Would be half full of water and stars.        They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,        And they soon had me packed into bed;      But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,        And the stars going round in my head.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          MARCHING SONG          Bring the comb and play upon it!        Marching, here we come!      Willie cocks his highland bonnet,        Johnnie beats the drum.        Mary Jane commands the party,        Peter leads the rear;      Feet in time, alert and hearty,        Each a Grenadier!        All in the most martial manner        Marching double-quick;      While the napkin, like a banner,        Waves upon the stick!        Here's enough of fame and pillage,        Great commander Jane!      Now that we've been round the village,        Let's go home again.    [Illustration]          THE COW          The friendly cow all red and white,        I love with all my heart:      She gives me cream with all her might,        To eat with apple-tart.        She wanders lowing here and there,        And yet she cannot stray,      All in the pleasant open air,        The pleasant light of day;        And blown by all the winds that pass        And wet with all the showers,      She walks among the meadow grass        And eats the meadow flowers.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          HAPPY THOUGHT          The world is so full of a number of things,      I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.          THE WIND          I saw you toss the kites on high      And blow the birds about the sky;      And all around I heard you pass,      Like ladies' skirts across the grass--        O wind, a-blowing all day long,        O wind, that sings so loud a song!        I saw the different things you did,      But always you yourself you hid.      I felt you push, I heard you call,      I could not see yourself at all--        O wind, a-blowing all day long,        O wind, that sings so loud a song!        O you that are so strong and cold,      O blower, are you young or old?      Are you a beast of field and tree,      Or just a stronger child than me?        O wind, a-blowing all day long,        O wind, that sings so loud a song!    [Illustration]          KEEPSAKE MILL          Over the borders, a sin without pardon,        Breaking the branches and crawling below,      Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,        Down by the banks of the river, we go.        Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,        Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,      Here is the sluice with the race running under--        Marvellous places, though handy to home!        Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,        Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;      Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,        Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.        Years may go by, and the wheel in the river        Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,      Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever        Long after all of the boys are away.        Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,        Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;      Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,        Turning and churning that river to foam.        You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,        I with your marble of Saturday last,      Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled,        Here we shall meet and remember the past.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN          Children, you are very little,      And your bones are very brittle;      If you would grow great and stately,      You must try to walk sedately.        You must still be bright and quiet,      And content with simple diet;      And remain, through all bewild'ring,      Innocent and honest children.        Happy hearts and happy faces,      Happy play in grassy places--      That was how, in ancient ages,      Children grew to kings and sages.        But the unkind and the unruly,      And the sort who eat unduly,      They must never hope for glory--      Theirs is quite a different story!        Cruel children, crying babies,      All grew up as geese and gabies,      Hated, as their age increases,      By their nephews and their nieces.    [Illustration]          FOREIGN CHILDREN          Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,      Little frosty Eskimo,      Little Turk or Japanee,      Oh! don't you wish that you were me?        You have seen the scarlet trees      And the lions over seas;      You have eaten ostrich eggs,      And turned the turtles off their legs.        Such a life is very fine,      But it's not so nice as mine:      You must often, as you trod,      Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.        You have curious things to eat,      I am fed on proper meat;      You must dwell beyond the foam,      But I am safe and live at home.        Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,        Little frosty Eskimo,        Little Turk or Japanee,      Oh! don't you wish that you were me?    [Illustration: FOREIGN CHILDREN]    [Illustration]          THE SUN TRAVELS          The sun is not a-bed, when I      At night upon my pillow lie;      Still round the earth his way he takes,      And morning after morning makes.        While here at home, in shining day,      We round the sunny garden play,      Each little Indian sleepy-head      Is being kissed and put to bed.        And when at eve I rise from tea,      Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;      And all the children in the West      Are getting up and being dressed.          THE LAMPLIGHTER          My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.      It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;      For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,      With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.        Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,      And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;      But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,      O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!        For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,      And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;      And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light;      O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him tonight!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          MY BED IS A BOAT          My bed is like a little boat;        Nurse helps me in when I embark;      She girds me in my sailor's coat        And starts me in the dark.        At night, I go on board and say        Good-night to all my friends on shore;      I shut my eyes and sail away        And see and hear no more.        And sometimes things to bed I take,        As prudent sailors have to do;      Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,        Perhaps a toy or two.        All night across the dark we steer;        But when the day returns at last,      Safe in my room, beside the pier,        I find my vessel fast.    [Illustration]          THE MOON          The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;      She shines on thieves on the garden wall,      On streets and field and harbour quays,      And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.        The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,      The howling dog by the door of the house,      The bat that lies in bed at noon,      All love to be out by the light of the moon.        But all of the things that belong to the day      Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;      And flowers and children close their eyes      Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE SWING          How do you like to go up in a swing,        Up in the air so blue?      Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing        Ever a child can do!        Up in the air and over the wall,        Till I can see so wide,      Rivers and trees and cattle and all        Over the countryside--        Till I look down on the garden green,        Down on the roof so brown--      Up in the air I go flying again,        Up in the air and down!    [Illustration]          TIME TO RISE          A birdie with a yellow bill      Hopped upon the window sill,      Cocked his shining eye and said:      \"Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head!\"    [Illustration]          LOOKING-GLASS RIVER          Smooth it glides upon its travel,        Here a wimple, there a gleam--          O the clean gravel!          O the smooth stream!        Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,        Paven pools as clear as air--          How a child wishes          To live down there!        We can see our coloured faces        Floating on the shaken pool          Down in cool places,          Dim and very cool;        Till a wind or water wrinkle,        Dipping marten, plumping trout,    "]]]
