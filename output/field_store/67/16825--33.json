CHAPTER I.    _THE DRAWING BOARD._      A Drawing Board should be of soft pine and free from knots, so that it  will easily receive the pins or tacks used to fasten down the paper. Its  surface should be flat and level, or a little rounding, so that the  paper shall lie close to its surface, which is one of the first  requisites in making a good drawing. Its edges should be straight and at  a right angle one to the other, and the ends of the battens B B in  Figure 1 should fall a little short of the edge A of the board, so that  if the latter shrinks they will not protrude. The size of the board of  course depends upon the size of the paper, hence it is best to obtain a  board as small as will answer for the size of paper it is intended to  use. The student will find it most convenient as well as cheapest to  learn on small drawings rather than large ones, since they take less  time to make, and cost less for paper; and although they require more  skill to make, yet are preferable for the beginner, because he does not  require to reach so far over the board, and furthermore, they teach him  more quickly and effectively. He who can make a fair drawing having  short lines and small curves can make a better one if it has large  curves, etc., because it is easier to draw a large than a very small  circle or curve. It is unnecessary to enter into a description of the  various kinds of drawing boards in use, because if the student purchases  one he will be duly informed of the kinds and their special features,  while if he intends to make one the sketch in Figure 1 will give him all  the information he requires, save that, as before noted, the wood must  be soft pine, well seasoned and free from knots, while the battens B  should be dovetailed in and the face of the board trued after they are  glued and driven in. To true the edges square, it is best to make the  two longest edges parallel and straight, and then the ends may be  squared from those long edges.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    THE $T$ SQUARE.    Drawing squares or T squares, as they are termed, are made of wood, of  hard rubber and of steel.    There are several kinds of T squares; in one the blade is solid, as it  is shown in Figure 5 on page 20; in another the back of the square is  pivoted, so that the blade can be set to draw lines at an angle as well  as across the board, which is often very convenient, although this  double back prevents the triangles, when used in some positions, from  coming close enough to the left hand side of the board. In an improved  form of steel square, with pivoted blade, shown in Figure 2, the back is  provided with a half circle divided into the degrees of a circle, so  that the blade can be set to any required degree of angle at once.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]      THE TRIANGLES.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    Two triangles are all that are absolutely necessary for a beginner. The  first is that shown in Figure 3, which is called a triangle of 45  degrees, because its edge A is at that angle to edges B and C. That in  Figure 4 is called a triangle of 60 degrees, its edge A being at 60  degrees to B, and at 30 degrees to C. The edges P and C are at a right  angle or an angle of 90 degrees in both figures; hence they are in this  respect alike. By means of these triangles alone, a great many straight  line drawings may be made with ease without the use of a drawing square;  but it is better for the beginner to use the square at first. The manner  of using these triangles with the square is shown in Figure 5, in which  the triangle, Figure 3, is shown in three positions marked D E F, and  that shown in Figure 4 is shown in three positions, marked respectively  G H and I. It is obvious, however, that by turning I over, end for end,  another position is attained. The usefulness in these particular  triangles is because in the various positions shown they are capable of  use for drawing a very large proportion of the lines that occur in  mechanical drawing. The principal requirement in their use is to hold  them firmly to the square-blade without moving it, and without  permitting them to move upon it. The learner will find that this is best  attained by so regulating the height of the square-blade that the line  to be drawn does not come down too near the bottom of the triangle or  edge of the square-blade, nor too high on the triangle; that is to say,  too near its uppermost point. It is the left-hand edge of the triangle  that is used, whenever it can be done, to produce the required line.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]      CURVES.    To draw curves that are not formed of arcs or parts of circles,  templates called curves are provided, examples of these forms being  given in Figure 6. They are made in wood and in hard rubber, the latter  being most durable; their uses are so obvious as to require no  explanation. It may be remarked, however, that the use of curves gives  excellent practice, because they must be adjusted very accurately to  produce good results, and the drawing pen must be held in the same  vertical plane, or the curve drawn will not be true in its outline.      DRAWING INSTRUMENTS.    It is not intended or necessary to enter into an elaborate discussion of  the various kinds of drawing instruments, since the purchaser can obtain  a good set of drawing instruments from a reputable dealer by paying a  proportionate price, and must _per force_ learn to use such as his means  enable him to purchase. It is recommended that the beginner purchase as  good a set of instruments as his means will permit, and that if his  means are limited he purchase less than a full set of instruments,  having the same of good quality.    All the instruments that need be used in the examples of this book are  as follows:    A small spring bow-pen for circles, a lining pen or pen for straight  lines, a small spring bow-pencil for circles, a large bow-pen with a  removable leg to replace by a divider leg or a pencil leg, and having an  extension piece to increase its capacity.    The spring bow-pen should have a stiff spring, and should be opened out  to its full capacity to see that the spring acts well when so opened  out, keeping the legs stiff when opened for the larger diameters. The  purchaser should see that the joint for opening and closing the legs is  an easy but not a loose fit on the screw, and that the legs will not  move sideways. To test this latter, which is of great importance in the  spring bow-pencil as well as in the pen, it is well to close the legs  nearly together and taking one leg in one hand and the other leg in the  other hand (between the forefinger and thumb), pushing and pulling them  sideways, any motion in that direction being sufficient to condemn the  instrument. It is safest and best to have the two legs of the bow-pen  and pencil made from one piece of metal, and not of two separate pieces  screwed together at the top, as the screw will rarely hold them firmly  together. The points should be long and fine, and as round as possible.  In very small instruments separate points that are fastened with a screw  are objectionable, because, in very small circles, they hide the point  and make it difficult to apply the instrument to the exact proper point  or spot on the drawing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23344"],[0,"The Magic Fishbone (#3)"],[1,"requested at church in half an hour precisely.\" So she and the Princess  Alicia got into the carriage, and Mr Pickles's boy handed in the Duchess  who sat by herself on the opposite seat, and then Mr Pickles's boy put up  the steps and got up behind, and the Peacocks flew away with their tails  spread.    [Illustration: She appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little Bride]    Prince Certainpersonio was sitting by himself, eating barley-sugar  and waiting to be ninety. When he saw the Peacocks followed by the  carriage, coming in at the window, it immediately occurred to him that  something uncommon was going to happen.    \"Prince,\" said Grandmarina, \"I bring you your Bride.\"    The moment the Fairy said those words, Prince Certainpersonio's face left  off being stickey, and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach-bloom  velvet, and his hair curled, and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and  settled on his head. He got into the carriage by the Fairy's invitation,  and there he renewed his acquaintance with the Duchess, whom he had seen  before.    In the church were the Prince's relations and friends, and the Princess  Alicia's relations and friends, and the seventeen Princes and Princesses,  and the baby, and a crowd of the neighbours. The marriage was beautiful  beyond expression. The Duchess was bridesmaid, and beheld the ceremony  from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk.    Grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards, in which there  was everything and more to eat, and everything and more to drink. The  wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons, frosted  silver and white lilies, and was forty-two yards round.    When Grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple, and Prince  Certainpersonio had made a speech, and everybody had cried Hip hip hip  hurrah! Grandmarina announced to the King and Queen that in future there  would be eight quarter days in every year, except in leap year, when there  would be ten. She then turned to Certainpersonio and Alicia, and said, \"My  dears, you will have thirty-five children, and they will all be good and  beautiful. Seventeen of your children will be boys, and eighteen will be  girls. The hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally. They  will never have the measles, and will have recovered from the  whooping-cough before being born.\"    On hearing such good news, everybody cried out \"Hip hip hip hurrah!\"  again.    \"It only remains,\" said Grandmarina in conclusion, \"to make an end of the  fish-bone.\"    So she took it from the hand of the Princess Alicia, and it instantly flew  down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door and  choked him, and he expired in convulsions.
