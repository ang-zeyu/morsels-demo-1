CONVERSATION I.    ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHEMISTRY.      MRS. B.    As you have now acquired some elementary notions of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY,  I am going to propose to you another branch of science, to which I am  particularly anxious that you should devote a share of your attention.  This is CHEMISTRY, which is so closely connected with Natural  Philosophy, that the study of the one must be incomplete without some  knowledge of the other; for, it is obvious that we can derive but a very  imperfect idea of bodies from the study of the general laws by which  they are governed, if we remain totally ignorant of their intimate  nature.    CAROLINE.    To confess the truth, Mrs. B., I am not disposed to form a very  favourable idea of chemistry, nor do I expect to derive much  entertainment from it. I prefer the sciences which exhibit nature on a  grand scale, to those that are confined to the minutiae of petty details.  Can the studies which we have lately pursued, the general properties of  matter, or the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, be compared to the  mixing up of a few insignificant drugs? I grant, however, there may be  entertaining experiments in chemistry, and should not dislike to try  some of them: the distilling, for instance, of lavender, or rose  water . . . . . .    MRS. B.    I rather imagine, my dear Caroline, that your want of taste for  chemistry proceeds from the very limited idea you entertain of its  object. You confine the chemist's laboratory to the narrow precincts of  the apothecary's and perfumer's shops, whilst it is subservient to an  immense variety of other useful purposes. Besides, my dear, chemistry is  by no means confined to works of art. Nature also has her laboratory,  which is the universe, and there she is incessantly employed in chemical  operations. You are surprised, Caroline, but I assure you that the most  wonderful and the most interesting phenomena of nature are almost all of  them produced by chemical powers. What Bergman, in the introduction to  his history of chemistry, has said of this science, will give you a more  just and enlarged idea of it. The knowledge of nature may be divided, he  observes, into three periods. The first was that in which the attention  of men was occupied in learning the external forms and characters of  objects, and this is called _Natural History_. In the second, they  considered the effects of bodies acting on each other by their  mechanical power, as their weight and motion, and this constitutes the  science of _Natural Philosophy_. The third period is that in which the  properties and mutual action of the elementary parts of bodies was  investigated. This last is the science of CHEMISTRY, and I have no doubt  you will soon agree with me in thinking it the most interesting.    You may easily conceive, therefore, that without entering into the  minute details of practical chemistry, a woman may obtain such a  knowledge of the science as will not only throw an interest on the  common occurrences of life, but will enlarge the sphere of her ideas,  and render the contemplation of nature a source of delightful  instruction.    CAROLINE.    If this is the case, I have certainly been much mistaken in the notion I  had formed of chemistry. I own that I thought it was chiefly confined to  the knowledge and preparation of medicines.    MRS. B.    That is only a branch of chemistry which is called Pharmacy; and, though  the study of it is certainly of great importance to the world at large,  it belongs exclusively to professional men, and is therefore the last  that I should advise you to pursue.    EMILY.    But, did not the chemists formerly employ themselves in search of the  philosopher's stone, or the secret of making gold?    MRS. B.    These were a particular set of misguided philosophers, who dignified  themselves with the name of Alchemists, to distinguish their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],[0,"Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#3)"],[1,"ren)    We agree with this recommendation, and we understand that the necessary  provision has already been written into a new Child Welfare Bill which  is in course of preparation.          _Paragraph (d), page 62_ (notification of fact of expulsion of a      child from school)    This proposal has already been given effect to by administrative  direction. We feel that legislation on this point will not be  necessary.          _Paragraph (e), page 63_ (notification to be given to principal of      a school where child found to be delinquent)    In normal practice the Child Welfare Officer does take a head teacher  into his confidence when placing a child in his school district and  actively seeks his co-operation. There are odd cases, however, where it  may be thought that an individual head teacher should not be given, in  the words of the report, all \"the circumstances which led to the  delinquency\". This would be a very rare occurrence, but the statutory  obligation to tell everything he knew on every occasion might prevent  the Child Welfare Officer's taking steps he believed to be in the best  interests of all concerned. The best results, we feel, will come from  wise administrative action and from a general improvement in the mutual  understanding between teachers and Child Welfare Officers.    The Committee felt that when information of this nature was passed on  to a Headmaster it should be treated as confidential. We feel strongly  that any child should always have a full opportunity of repentance and  of re-establishing his character, and where a child showed that  definite improvement had been made by him his chances of rehabilitation  should not be prejudiced by the fact of his earlier breach.          _Paragraph (f), page 63_ (recommendation that Child Welfare Act be      completely redrafted, etc.)    A complete redraft of the Act is now in course of preparation.    Further comments on paragraph (_f_) above were made by Dr Beeby. They  are as follow:        \"We think that the right of appeal from the decisions of the      Children's Courts might be usefully made explicit in the Child      Welfare Act. We agree also that it might be well to provide for the      right of appeal against the Superintendent in certain      circumstances. If the system is to be workable and not brought to a      standstill by a mass of frivolous appeals, it will be necessary to      restrict the right of appeal. If an appeal were to lie every time      the Superintendent shifted a ward of State, the proceedings would      be endless. The only appeal, we think, should be one to have a      child discharged from the care of the Superintendent. Serious      complaints of ill treatment could be aired in this way. We are not      able to suggest, off-hand, exactly what the restrictions should be,      and very full discussions between Child Welfare authorities and      legal authorities would be necessary as a preliminary to effective      legislation on the point.\"    Little, if anything, appeared in the Mazengarb Committee's report to  justify us in thinking that a right of appeal of the kind suggested  should be provided. The Committee express the hope that a step of this  kind should not be taken unless sound reasons were advanced for taking  it.      Summary of Proposals for Administrative Action    In its report at pages 67 and 68 the Mazengarb Committee set out a  number of proposals which in its view could be met by appropriate  action on the part of the Departments mentioned by the Committee. The  suggestions made have been considered by the Departments, and we give  below a statement of the extent to which the suggestions have been  carried into effect.    (_a_) Police Department    It was suggested that the training of policewomen should be considered  with a view to deciding the best method of dealing with girls involved  in sexual offences.    For the information of Parliament we set out below a few excerpts from  a report prepared in the Police Department and sent to us by the  Minister of Police. The excerpts are to the following effect:        \"A. _Selection and Training_        \"The minimum educational qualities required are secondary school      (Form 2).        \"Policewomen are not required for clerical or administrative      duties, therefore importance is not attached to ability to perform      office work, typing, or shorthand writing.        \"Recruits chosen with due regard to the foregoing are required to      undergo a course extending over five weeks in the Police School at      Lyttelton. They are coached in subjects relating to statutes,      general police duties, powers and responsibilities of the police,      methods of dealing with various contingencies with which they may      be faced when on duty, relations with and bearing towards the      general public, first-aid, and self-defence. In short, this course      is similar in character to that undergone by male recruits to the      Force.        \"Women recruits are instructed by a pathologist in matters      pertaining to pregnancy, abortion, and the identification of      abortion instruments and drugs. They receive instruction in      maternity hospitals, with special reference to the unmarried      mother. Children's homes, orphanages, and also homes for the aged      are visited and studied with a view to creating a solid background      for the policewomen's work.        \"With the co-operation of the Justice Department women trainees      visit prisons and borstal institutions. They also attend and study      procedure at Magistrates' and Supreme Courts. The workings of the      probation service and Child Welfare Department are also the subject      of visits and study.        \"The training course of five weeks is shorter than that for men,      but women recruits appear to absorb instruction more quickly and      less time is devoted to physical training.        \"B. _Suggestions Relative to Training_        \"It is felt the present training syllabus coupled with the      practical experience which rapidly follows is adequate and that      each policewoman is capable of dealing with the problem of the girl      who has been involved in sexual offences.        \"C. _Further Comments_        \"The Police Department appreciates that if increased numerically      and used more generally policewomen may be a great factor in the      prevention of juvenile delinquency, provided that through their      frequent association with children, both in the company of their      parents and at all grades of school, they become accepted by these      young persons from infancy. The help and guidance of women police      could be sought on grounds similar to those of the school dental      nurse who in her particular sphere is banishing the fear of dental      treatment. It is felt a similar approach to the child's moral      welfare is worthy of consideration.\"    It is a fact that within recent weeks steps have been taken by the  Government to establish and operate an improved system of training for  recruits for the Police Force. We had no information before us as to  the nature of the course or the length of the training period: nor do  we know whether a specific course of training will be prescribed for  women recruits. We feel, however, that it is a fair assumption that a  sounder, more thorough, and more systematic system is about to be put  into operation. We feel, too, that with the increased emphasis about to  be laid upon training, it can safely be taken for granted that every  effort has been, and will continue to be, made to give effect to the  suggestions of the Mazengarb Committee.      (_b_) Department of Internal Affairs    It was a recommendation of the Mazengarb Committee that steps should be  taken to gazette the outstanding regulations authorized under the  relevant film censorship Acts of 1934 and 1953.    A report received from the Department of Internal Affairs contains the  information set out below:        \"It could be assumed from the terms of the recommendation that no      regulations are at present in force governing the censorship of      films and film posters. This, however, is not the case, as      appropriate regulations have been in operation for many years. What      is now contemplated is a revision of the existing regulations to      take account of later legislation and to modernise them in the      light of new developments and policies relating to this aspect of      the film industry.        \"In particular, the Cinematograph Films Amendment Act 1953 made      fairly extensive amendments to existing law relating to censorship,      and this in turn has led to the necessity for a completely new      approach to certain policy and machinery aspects of the existing      regulations. For these reasons, and as the film industry is a      licensed and controlled industry, the Committee will understand      that it has not been possible, or even perhaps desirable, to      progress as speedily as would be the case with other regulations      of a more normal character.        \"For the information of your Committee the general position now is      that the regulations are in a final stage of preparation and will      be submitted for Government approval as soon as practicable.\"    We have been advised that quite recently a final draft of the  regulations was forwarded to the Film Industry Board for consideration.  We were told, too, that conferences are being held between officers of  the Department of Internal Affairs on the one hand and members of the  Film Industry Board on the other. It is expected that at the conclusion  of such conferences an agreed draft will be sent forward to the  Government.      (_c_) Broadcasting Service    Two recommendations were before us for our consideration:        (1) \"That the Service ensure that the concept 'Crime must never      pay' is more prominently featured in crime serials;"]]]
