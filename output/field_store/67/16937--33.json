[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#3)"],[1,"to geographic isolation has probably  hindered gene flow, thus allowing rapid local adaptation, recognizable  in variation at the infraspecific level. Miller (_loc. cit._) listed  other birds that have expanded their ecologic scope; his work should be  referred to for further details.    The following birds are associated with this province: Black Vulture,  Scaled Quail (_C. s. pallida_), Turkey, Elf Owl, Green Kingfisher,  Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. icastus_), Ladder-backed Woodpecker (_D. s.  cactophilus_), Wied's Crested Flycatcher, Buff-breasted Flycatcher,  Vermilion Flycatcher (_P. r. flammeus_), Black-crested Titmouse (_P. a.  dysleptus_), Cactus Wren (_C. b. couesi_), Curve-billed Thrasher (_T.  c. celsum_), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (_P. c. amoenissima_), Hutton's  Vireo (_V. h. carolinae_), Summer Tanager (_P. r. cooperi_), and  Black-throated Sparrow (_A. b. opuntia_). Several kinds of birds, such  as the Band-tailed Pigeon, occur in the \"pine islands\" in this province  rather than on the desert floor.    There remain several kinds of birds that are not especially associated  with any one or two of the above-named provinces. These birds are  widely distributed and vary geographically without corresponding to the  Biotic Provinces. Examples of these species are: Black Phoebe (_S. n.  semiatra_ in northern Coahuila; _S. n. nigricans_ in southern Coahuila),  Violet-green Swallow (_T. t. lepida_ in northwestern Coahuila; _T. t.  thalassina_ in southeastern Coahuila), Black-eared Bushtit (_P. m.  lloydi_ in northern Coahuila; _P. m. iulus_ in southeastern Coahuila),  White-breasted Nuthatch (_S. c. nelsoni_ in northern Coahuila; _S. c.  mexicana_ in southern Coahuila), Brown-throated Wren (_T. b. cahooni_  in northern Coahuila; _T. b. compositus_ in southern Coahuila), Crissal  Thrasher (_T. d. dorsale_ in northern Coahuila; _T. d. dumosum_ in  southern Coahuila), and Rufous-crowned Sparrow (_A. r. tenuirostris_ in  northern Coahuila; _A. r. boucardi_ in southern Coahuila).    Some representatives of the avifauna of the central and southern  sections of the Central Plateau reach southwestern Coahuila. The  subspecies _squamata_ of the Scaled Quail and _eurhyncha_ of the Blue  Grosbeak are examples. Each in Coahuila seems to be at the northern  limit of its range.    In summary, there are three associations of vegetation in Coahuila and  each has characteristic birds. Gross climate and topography, through  their influence on vegetation, are the prime factors in the distribution   and kinds of birds in the State. Some birds of central and southern   Mexico reach southeastern and southwestern Coahuila. Representatives   of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon as well as   migrants of the eastern flyway occur in northeastern Coahuila. Most of   the species that occur in Coahuila seem to be associated with western   North America. The aridity of western Coahuila restricts, to a large   extent, the diversity of the breeding populations of its avifauna.   Xeric conditions surrounding some of the higher mountains are barriers   to movement of some species.      ORIGIN OF BREEDING BIRDS OF COAHUILA    Probably beginning in the late Pliocene and ending in the Ice Age  (Griscom, 1950:379) the refrigeration of climate in the Northern  Hemisphere initiated a period of southward withdrawal of birds from the  northern part of North America. Some members of the avifauna of  Coahuila probably reached the State in this time. When the continental  deserts were formed, or reformed, many tropical and subtropical Middle  American species were forced to leave Coahuila. Species associated with  arid conditions found their way there. Many representatives of the Old  World element also seem to have found their way to the State during the  refrigeration of climate in the Northern Hemisphere. The separation of  North and South America in the greater part of the Tertiary (Mayr,  1946:9) that deterred mammals from intercontinental colonization  seemingly did not hinder birds. Some South American species moved  northward into Mexico, all the way north to Coahuila.    The avifauna of Coahuila today is a mixture of the several mentioned  elements. Of the breeding populations, 43 per cent breed in the western  rather than the eastern United States, 6 per cent breed in the eastern  rather than the western United States, 30 per cent breed in both the  eastern and western United States, 20 per cent are restricted to the  Republic of Mexico, and the southern parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and  Texas, and 1 per cent (Aztec Thrush and Rufous-capped Atlapetes) is  endemic to the Republic of Mexico.    It is instructive to consider also the origin of avifaunal elements at  the level of Family. According to Mayr (1946:11) most North American  families and subfamilies clearly originated in the Old World, in South  America, or from a North American element that developed in the partial  isolation of North America in the Tertiary. Three other elements, the  Panboreal, the Pan-American, and the Pantropical are represented by  some North American families and subfamilies. Because of the obscurity  of the place of origin of certain groups, an additional unanalyzed  element must be recognized.    The Caprimulgidae and Picidae probably originated in North America  (Mayr, 1946:26). Although the Psittacidae are Pantropical in  distribution, indications are that they probably originated in the Old  World (Mayr, 1946:17). The Phasianidae, Turdidae (_Myadestes-Hylocichla_  group), and Sylviidae (Polioptilinae) seem to have originated in the  Old World (Mayr, 1946:27). However, Mayr considered these groups to  have had a secondary center of proliferation in North America, and I  thus consider these groups to have a North American origin. Mayr  (1946:27) considered the Trochilidae, Tyrannidae, and Icteridae  Pan-American in distribution; however, he suggested that they probably  originated in South America, and I here treat them as South American in  origin. No representatives of the Pan-American element that probably  originated in North America have been recorded from Coahuila nor have  members of the Panboreal element (Mayr, 1946:11) been recorded in the  State. According to my analysis, representatives of families of birds  known to breed in Coahuila and those that probably breed there thus  seem to have been derived historically from the following sources:        Old World           24.7%      North America       37.0%      South America       24.0%      Unanalyzed          14.3%    Mayr (1946:28-29) gave examples of analysis by geographic origin of the  breeding species of several districts of North America. For instance,  at Yakutat Bay in southeastern Alaska the South American element of  breeding passerine species was 3 per cent, the North American element  39 per cent, and the Old World element 58 per cent whereas at Sonora,  Mexico, the South American element of breeding passerine species was 27  per cent, the North American element 52 per cent, and the Old World  element 21 per cent. The breeding avifauna of Coahuila is thus in line  with Mayr's analysis, resembling that of Sonora to a considerable  degree at the taxonomic level of Family.      ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES    **_Podiceps caspicus_ (Hablizl).--On March 31, 1952, Olmstead saw \"many  Eared Grebes\" on a pond 10 mi. E Hacienda La Mariposa. This is the  first record of the Eared Grebe in Coahuila.    [_Pelecanus erythrorhynchos_ Gmelin.--The White Pelican is uncommon, if  not rare; Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:21) list it.]    _Anhinga anhinga_ (Linnaeus).--On March 31, 1952, Olmstead noted an  Anhinga perched on a submerged fence post in a lake 10 mi. E Hacienda  La Mariposa. This is the first record of the Anhinga in Coahuila.    **_Ardea herodias_ Linnaeus.--Two subspecies of the Great Blue Heron,  _treganzai_ and _wardi_, have been recorded from Coahuila. Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1950:27) listed _A. h. treganzai_ from the State;  presumably this subspecies occurs widely in low density. They (_loc.  cit._) remarked also that a record of _A. h. wardi_ from Coahuila  \"cannot be allocated subspecifically.\"    Dickerman saw two Great Blue Herons in a marshy area at San Marcos (=20  mi. S Cuatro Cienegas) on May 4, 1954. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:12)  noted the Great Blue Heron \"near Boquillas [Texas], along the Rio  Grande, on May 10 and 15....\"    **_Butorides virescens_ (Linnaeus).--Olmstead saw a Green Heron at  Boquillas, 700 feet, on March 10, 1952. Findley reported seeing Green  Herons 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 feet, on June 19, 1952, and 2 mi. S and 3  mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952.    **_Casmerodius albus egretta_ (Gmelin).--The Common Egret is an  uncommon migrant in Coahuila. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:30)  recorded _C. a. egretta_ from the \"extreme northern part\" of Coahuila.  Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:12) saw the Common Egret \"along the Rio  Grande on the Graham ranch just west of Boquillas,\" Texas, on May 16,  which might well be the locality to which Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  referred. Olmstead saw a Common Egret at Don Martin on March 22, 1952.    **_Nycticorax nycticorax hoactli_ (Gmelin).--This subspecies of the  Black-crowned Night Heron was listed from the \"extreme north\" section  of Coahuila by Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:32). Van Tyne and  Sutton (1937:14) saw three Black-crowned Night Herons along the Rio  Grande about two miles west of Boquillas, Texas, on May 16. This record  probably represents the locality to which Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (_op. cit._) referred.    _Nyctanassa violacea violacea_ (Linnaeus).--A Yellow-crowned Night  Heron in immediate post-juvenile plumage, No. 36413, was obtained on  September 7, 1958, 16 km. south of Cuatro Cienegas, by W. L. Minckley.  According to him the bird was accompanied by \"several\" other herons  seemingly of the same species and condition of plumage.

Pick up the 4 stitches cast on at base of thumb, making 48 stitches on  the hand. Knit 15 rounds, then divide the stitches as follows: Slip 24  stitches on one knitting-needle for top of hand starting from the 3d  cast-on stitch at beginning of thumb, and the remaining 24 stitches for  palm of hand on another needle.    First Finger: Knit 6 stitches from top of hand, slip remaining 18  stitches on a safety-pin, also 18 stitches from palm of hand on another  safety-pin, cast on 3 stitches for between fingers, knit remaining 6  from palm of hand, making 15 stitches in all, on these knit 30 rounds,  and finish off as directed for the thumb.    Second Finger: Knit 7 stitches from back of hand, cast on 3 stitches,  knit 6 stitches from palm of hand, and pick up 3 stitches cast on at  base of first finger, making 19 stitches on needle; * knit 1 round  plain; knit to last 2 stitches of round, which will be 2 of the stitches  picked up, narrow; repeat from * twice, and on the 16 stitches remaining  knit 28 rounds more, 34 rounds in all; narrow off like the thumb.    Third Finger: Knit 6 stitches from safety-pin at top of hand, cast on 3  stitches, knit 6 from palm of hand, and pick up 3 stitches at base of  second finger, making 18 stitches in all; knit 1st 6 rounds as directed  for 2d finger, knit 25 more rounds on remaining 15 stitches, and narrow  off as thumb.    Fourth Finger: Knit 5 stitches from back of hand on 1 needle, 6 stitches  from palm on another, pick up 3 stitches at base of 3d finger on 3d  needle, knit 26 rounds on the 14 stitches, then narrow off as the thumb.    These directions are for the left glove. Knit the right glove in same  way to where you divide the stitches for the fingers; then remember that  the palm of the glove must be toward you, the thumb on the right-hand  side. So you would first knit 6 stitches from palm, cast on 3, and knit  7 from back of hand, reversing directions as given for left glove.          Children's Knitted Sets      Set No. 1    [Illustration: Set No. 1]    Hood.--Cast on 80 stitches, and knit back and forth for 70 rows, or 35  ribs; then join the color and knit 6 ribs, and bind off evenly. Sew up  the edge where you cast on for the back of the hood. Fold the border  back its width, and pick up the stitches across end of this and the 6  ribs back of it on the body of hood, then the stitches around neck and  the other side of border, knit 3 ribs, then in next row, knit 4, over,  narrow, and repeat, ending with knit 3. This row forms the holes for the  cord. Knit back plain, knit 3 more ribs and bind off.    The hood may be of any desired size by casting on any number of  stitches, and knitting just half that number of ribs.    Scarf.--Cast on 30 stitches (or 35 for a little wider scarf); knit 14  ribs of blue, 3 of gray, 2 of blue, 1 of gray and 2 of blue; then knit  34 inches of gray, 2 ribs of blue and continue with the other end as at  first, reversing the order. Knot fringe of the two colors in at each  end.    Sweater.--Cast on 60 stitches, and knit 2, purl 2 (or double rib) for  two inches. Knit plain for 100 rows (or 50 ribs, if you knit back and  forth; the model was knitted forward and purled back, to give the work  the appearance of plain knitting on the right side). Cast on 42 stitches  for sleeve, knit back and cast on 42 stitches for the other sleeve; knit  30 rows on this length, then take 65 stitches off on an extra needle,  bind off 14 stitches for neck, and on the remaining 65 stitches work 12  rows; then cast on 13 stitches toward the front and on this length knit  28 rows, bind off 42 stitches for the sleeve, work 18 rows on the  remaining stitches, slip these on an extra needle, work the other front  to correspond, slip all the stitches on one needle, knit until the front  is as long as the back, and finish with the double rib for two inches;  bind off evenly.    Using the color, pick up the stitches at the end of sleeve and knit back  and forth for 12 rows; bind off. Sew up the sleeves and underarm seams  and turn back the cuffs.    For the collar pick up the stitches around the neck, knit 8 rows of  gray, then 6 rows of color, and bind off.    Work around edge of collar and down the front opening with double  crochet, 1 chain between; lace up the front with cord, ends finished  with balls or tassels.      Set No. 2    [Illustration: Set No. 2]    Jacket.--Cast on 52 stitches and knit 60 rows or 30 ribs; cast on 26  stitches for sleeve, knit back and cast on 26 stitches for the other  sleeve. Knit 34 rows, then knit 43 stitches, bind off 18 stitches for  the neck, knit remaining 43 stitches, and on these continue with the  front. Knit 6 rows, then continue knitting back and forth, adding a  stitch at the end of each row toward the front for 22 rows, which will  give 11 extra stitches; knit 6 rows without widening, then bind off 26  stitches, and knit remainder of front to correspond with the back.    Knit the other front in same way, sew up sleeves and underarm seams,  work around the neck with double crochet, in color, 1 chain between, and  around the body of the jacket with shells of three trebles in a stitch,  miss space of two ribs; repeat. With the gray make 2 trebles, picot of 3  chain caught in last treble and 1 treble around neck, and between 1st  and 2d trebles of shells around body of jacket. Finish edge of sleeves  in the same way, and run in cord and balls.    For the Hood.--Cast on 64 stitches, knit 28 ribs, then 2 ribs of color  and 2 of gray; bind off, sew up the back of hood where cast on, finish  around the neck with double crochet, space of 2 chain between, using  color, work the shells around front of hood, and finish with the shells  of gray, as for jacket. Run in the cord, with balls of the two colors of  yarn.    The cords may be done in plain crochet, the ordinary chain or, as  preferred because stronger, knotted by what is called the \"fool's  delight\" method, although why named thus it is impossible to say. Surely  it seems a very sensible way: Take a length of yarn six times as long as  the cord is wanted; make a slip or half knot at one end and pass the  other end down through it to form a loop, then tie the ends of yarn  together. Hold this knot between thumb and forefinger of one hand, say  the right, with the yarn which pulls through the knot under the same  hand, and the loop which was formed held on the forefinger; hold the  yarn which does not pull in the left hand, pass the forefinger of the  left hand through the loop on right forefinger from front to back, catch  up and pull through the non-pulling or left-hand thread--exactly as you  would make a chain-stitch in crochet--transfer the knot (which ties the  two ends together) to the thumb and forefinger of left hand, keeping the  loop over forefinger, and draw up the pulling yarn. Now the position of  the loop, pulling yarn and knot is exactly the same in the left hand as  formerly in the right. Continue by passing the forefinger of right hand  through the loop, catching up the non-pulling thread and drawing it  through to form the new loop (on right hand again), transfer the knot  and pull up. This is really a sort of double chain, and when one has  learned to make it evenly and well, it will be found superior for bags,  lingerie, and many other articles requiring a drawstring or cord.          A Serviceable Sweater      [Illustration: A Serviceable Sweater]    Use fourfold Germantown zephyr and a pair of No. 5 needles, with one  pair two sizes smaller. As the sizes or numbers of needles vary, and  also do methods of knitting, it is a good plan to work a little block  before beginning the pattern. Cast on, say, 12 stitches, knit across and  purl back, repeating these two rows until you have a square. There  should be 5 stitches to the inch in width, and seven rows should make an  inch in length. If you get less, use larger needles, say No. 6.    It is also a good plan to practise on the pattern a little, so that you  will become familiar with it and can narrow or widen and still keep the  ridge. Cast on any number of stitches divisible by four, with one stitch  over, knit 2, purl 2, until but one stitch remains, and knit that. All  rows are the same, the odd stitch breaking the rib and making a ridge.  When you come to the decreasing later you can tell whether you are  keeping the pattern correct, by watching the knitted stitch, which forms  a sort of chain right on top of the ridge, and must be kept throughout.    Left front: Cast on 65 stitches on the larger needles and knit 12 rows  plain for the band at lower edge.    13. Knit 10 (these stitches are for the plain border up the front), *  purl 2, knit 2, repeat from *, knitting last stitch.    14. Slip 1, purl 1, * knit 2, purl 2, repeat from *, knitting last 10.  Repeat these two rows until you have 110 rows in all.    111. Knit 2, narrow, knit 6; finish row in pattern.    112. In pattern until 9 stitches remain, knit these.    113. Knit 2, narrow, knit 5; continue in pattern.    114. In pattern, knitting last 8 stitches.    115. Knit 2, narrow, knit 4; continue in pattern.    116. Like 114th, knitting 7 at end.    117. Knit 2, narrow, knit 3; continue in pattern.    118. Like 114th, knitting last 6.    119. Knit 2, narrow, knit 2; continue in pattern.    120. Bind off 3, knit in pattern to within 5 stitches of end, knit  these.    121. Knit 2, narrow, knit 1; continue in pattern.    122. Like 120th row, knitting 4 at end.    123. Knit 2, narrow; continue in pattern.    124. Like 120th row, knitting 3 at end.    125, 127, 129. Like 123d row.    126, 128. Bind off 1, knit in pattern until 3 stitches remain, knit  these.    130. Knit in pattern until 3 stitches remain, knit these.    Continue to work until you have completed the 171st row, doing the odd  rows like the 123d and even rows like 130th, when you"]]]
