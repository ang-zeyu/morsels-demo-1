ROY'S MOTHER AND TUTOR.    \"I had missed you, Roy,\" said the lady, smiling proudly on the boy; and  he looked with eyes full of pride at the beautiful woman, who now rested  her arm upon his shoulder and walked by his side into the more homelike  part of the old fortalice, whose grim interior had been transformed by  wainscoting, hangings, carpets, stained glass, and massive oak furniture  into the handsome mansion of the middle of the seventeenth century.    They passed down a broad staircase into a noble hall, and from thence  into a library whose broad, low, mullioned stone window opened into what  had been the inner court of the castle, whose ramparts and flanking  corner towers were still there; but the echoing stones that had once  paved it had given place to verdant lawn, trim flower-beds ablaze with  bloom, quaintly-cut shrubs, and creepers which beautified the walls once  so bare and grim.    \"I want to talk to you, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, sinking into a great  formal chair.  \"Bring your stool and sit down.\"    \"Got too big for the stool, mother,\" said the boy; \"I can't double up my  legs close enough.  I'll sit here.\"    He threw himself upon the thick carpet at her feet, and rested his arms  upon her lap.    \"Want to talk to me?  I'd rather hear you read.\"    \"Not now, my dear.\"    \"Why, what's the matter, mother?\" said the boy, anxiously.  \"You're as  white as can be.  Got one of your headaches?\"    \"No, my boy,--at least, my head does ache.  But it is my heart, Roy,--my  heart.\"    \"Then you've heard bad news,\" cried the boy.  \"Oh, mother, tell me; what  is it?  Not about father?\"    \"No, no; Heaven forbid, my dear,\" cried Lady Royland, wildly.  \"It is  the absence of news that troubles me so.\"    \"I ought to say us,\" said Roy, angrily; \"but I'm so selfish and  thoughtless.\"    \"Don't think that, my boy.  You are very young yet, but I do wish you  would give more thought to your studies with Master Pawson.\"    The boy frowned.    \"I wish you'd let me read with you, mother,\" he said.  \"I understand  everything then, and I don't forget it; but when that old--\"    \"Master Palgrave Pawson,\" said Lady Royland, reprovingly, but with a  smile.    \"Oh, well, Master Palgrave Pawson.  P.P., P.P.  What a mouthful it seems  to be!\"    \"Roy!\"    \"I've tried, mother; but I do get on so badly with him.  I can't help  it; I don't like him, and he doesn't like me, and it will always be the  same.\"    \"But why?  Why do you not like him?\"    \"Because--because--well, he always smiles at me so.\"    \"That does not seem as if he disliked you.  Rather the reverse.\"    \"He's so smooth and oily.\"    \"It is only his manner, my dear.  He seems to be very sincere, and to  have your welfare at heart.\"    \"Yes, that's it, mother; he won't let me alone.\"    \"But he is your tutor, my dear.  You know perfectly well that he came to  be your father's secretary and your tutor combined.\"    \"Yes, I know, mother,\" said the boy, impatiently; \"but somehow he  doesn't seem to teach me.\"    \"But he is very studious, and tries hard.\"    \"Yes, I know.  But he seems to think I'm about seven instead of nearly  seventeen, and talks to me as if I were a very little boy, and--and--and  we don't get on.\"    \"This sounds very sad, Roy, and I cannot bear to have a fresh trouble  now.  Your studies are so important to us.\"    Roy reached up to get his arms round his mother's neck, drew her head  down, and kissed her lovingly.    \"And she shan't have any more trouble,\" he cried.  \"I'll get wonderfully  fond of old Paw.\"    \"Roy!\"    \"Master Palgrave Pawson, then; and I'll work at my lessons and classics  like a slave.  But you will read with me, too, mother?\"    \"As much as you like, my son.  Thank you.  That has taken away part of  my load.\"    \"I wish I could take away the rest; but I know you're fidgeting because  father hasn't written, and think that something has happened to him.  But don't you get fancying that, because there can't be anything.  They've only gone after a mob of shoemakers and tailors with a  counterpane for flag, and father will scatter them all like dead  leaves.\"    \"Roy!  My boy, these are not your words?\"    \"No, mother; old Ben Martlet said something of that kind to me this  morning.\"    \"Does he not know, then, how serious it is?\"    \"Serious?  What do you mean by serious?\"    Lady Royland drew a deep breath, and laid her hand upon her side as if  in pain.    \"Why, mother,\" repeated the boy, \"what do you mean by serious?\"    \"This trouble--this rising, my dear.  We have had no news, but Master  Pawson has had letters from London, and he tells me that what was  supposed to be a little petty discontent has grown into a serious  revolution.\"    Roy gazed in his mother's troubled face as if he did not quite  comprehend the full extent of her words.    \"Well, and if it has, mother, what then?\"    \"What then, my boy?\"    \"Yes.  You've nothing to fidget about.  Father is there with his men,  and he'll soon put a stop to it all.  You know how stern he can be when  people misbehave.\"    \"My dear Roy, this, I am afraid, is going to be no little trouble that  your father can put down with his men.  Master Pawson tells me that  there is every prospect of its being a civil war.\"    \"What!  Englishmen fighting against Englishmen?\"    \"Yes; a terrible fratricidal war.\"    \"But who has quarrelled, mother?  Oh, the king will soon stop it.\"    \"Roy, my boy, we have kept you so shut up here in this retired place for  home study, instead of parting with you to send you to one of the great  schools, that in some things you are as ignorant as I.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" cried the boy, laughing.  \"You ignorant!  I only wish I  were half as learned and clever.  Why, father said--\"    \"Yes, yes, dear; but that is only book-learning.  We have been so happy  here that the jarring troubles of politics and the court have not  reached our ears; and I, for one, never gave them a thought till, after  all these years of peacefulness, your father found himself compelled to  obey the call of duty, and left us.  We both thought that it was only  for a week or two, and then the disturbance would be at an end; but  every letter he has sent me has contained worse news, till now it is  nearly a month since I have heard from him.\"    \"Then it is because he is putting down the rioters,\" said Roy, quickly.    \"Rioters, my boy!  Rebels you should say, for I fear that a great  attempt is to be made to overthrow the monarchy.  Master Pawson's  informants assure him that this is the case, and before long, he says,  there must be an encounter between the Royal and the Parliamentary  troops.\"    \"Is Master Pawson right, mother?  Royal troops--Parliamentary troops?  Why, they're all the same.\"    \"No, Roy; there is a division--a great division, I fear, and  discontented people are taking the side against the king.\"    \"Then I'm sorry for them,\" said the boy, flushing.  \"They'll get a most  terrible beating, these discontented folks.\"    \"Let us hope so, my boy, so that there may be an end to this terrible  anxiety.  To those who have friends whom they love in the army, a  foreign war is dreadful enough; but when I think of the possibility of a  war here at home, with Englishmen striving against Englishmen, I  shudder, and my heart seems to sink.\"    \"Look here,\" cried the boy, as he rose and stood with his hand resting  upon his mother's shoulder, \"you've been fidgeting and fancying all  sorts of things, because you haven't heard from father.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Lady Royland, faintly.    \"Then you mustn't, mother.  'Tis as I say; he is too busy to write, or  else he hasn't found it easy to send you a letter.  I'll take the pony  and ride over to Sidecombe and see when the Exeter wagon comes in.  There are sure to be letters for you, and even if there are not, it will  make you more easy for me to have been to see, and I can bring you back  what news there is.  I'll go at once.\"    Lady Royland took hold of her son's hand and held it fast.    \"No,\" she said, making an effort to be firm.  \"We will wait another day.  I have been fidgeting, dear, as you say, and it has made me nervous and  low-spirited; but I'm better now for talking to you, my boy, and letting  you share my trouble.  I dare say I have been exaggerating.\"    \"But I should like to ride over, mother.\"    \"You shall go to-morrow, Roy; but even then I shall be loath to let you.  There, you see I am quite cheerful again.  You are perfectly right;  your father is perhaps away with his men, and he may have sent, and the  letter has miscarried in these troublous times.\"    \"I shouldn't like to be the man who took it, if it has miscarried,\" said  the boy, laughing.    \"Poor fellow! it may have been an accident.  There, go to Master Pawson  now; and Roy, my dear, don't talk about our trouble to any one for the  present.\"    \"Not to old Pawson?\"    \"Master Pawson.\"    \"Not to Master Pawson?\" said Roy, smiling.    \"Not unless he speaks to you about it; then, of course, you can.\"    \"But he won't, mother.  He only talks to me about the Greek and Latin  poets and about music.  I say, you don't want to see me squeezing a big  fiddle between my knees and sawing at it with a bow as if I wanted to  cut all the strings, do you, mother?\"    \"My dear boy, not unless you wished to learn the violoncello.\"    \"Well, I don't,\" said Roy, pettishly; \"but old Master Pawson is always  bringing his out of its great green-baize bag and talking to me about  it.  He says that he will instruct me, and he is sure that my father  would have one sent to me from London if I asked him.  Just as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#3)"],[1,"ring,  devilry, romance, and villainy that had ever gathered for war.  For  such men there is only one type of leader, that is--the gentleman.  Not  the gentleman who says, \"Please,\" like a drawing-room lady; but the  gentleman who says, \"Come on, boys--here's a job,\" in a kindly, but  firm manner, with that touch of authority in the words which spells the  master and the man, and reveals to the skunk that if he refuses a great  fist will crack right under his chin and lay him out.  Sergeant-Major  Jones was, therefore, the gentleman required.  He represented the  finest virtues of the British N.C.O.--a class which has made the  British Army what it is to-day, and a class meanly paid and shockingly  neglected by the Governments of the past.    Sergeant-Major Jones had a breast of medals.  He knew his job.  Now  that was important to these Australians.  Australians are always up  against what they call \"the imported man.\"  But if the imported man is  what they call \"a good fellow,\" and knows his job better than they do,  they are fair enough to shake him by the hand and call him \"friend.\"  And the sergeant-major knew that he had to find an opportunity in the  first week to show that he _was_ the sergeant-major and that they were  there to be disciplined.  The opportunity came on the third day.  A  weak-looking sergeant, with a shrill, piping voice, was moving a squad  up and down.    \"Left--rights-left----  Stop  your  talking, Private Grouse,\" he  shouted to a tall, burly-built and dour-looking man in his squad.    \"Wot the deuce are you chippin' at?\"    \"Hold your tongue.\"    \"Swank,\" replied the insolent man.    Sergeant-Major Jones heard him.  \"Halt!\" he bellowed to the squad.    \"Now, young fellow, what do you mean?\"    \"Just 'aving a little lark, major,\" he answered casually.    \"Stand to attention, and 'sir' me when you speak.\"    \"You'll make us laugh,\" said the man in a familiar way.  The other  Bushmen craned their necks.  They were interested.  They knew that  Grouse had gone over the score, and they waited to see the stuff that  the sergeant-major was made of.  It was, in fact, the psychological  moment which makes or mars the reputation of a sergeant-major in such a  corps.  The sergeant-major knew it.    \"Look here, young man, I make great allowance for inexperience, for  none of you have been soldiers before, but I make no allowance for  insolence.  Take off your coat.\"    \"What!\"    \"Take off your coat,\" said the sergeant-major with emphasis, at the  same time throwing off his own.  The man followed suit.    \"Now step out here, and we'll decide who's going to run this show.\"    Then the unexpected happened.  The man shoved out his hand.  \"Shake,  sir; you're a good fellow.  I'm afeard of no man, but I won't fight  you, for I'm in the wrong.\"    \"Well, you're a man, anyway,\" said Jones, shaking him cordially by the  hand, while the whole squad gave out a thrilling cheer.    Colonel Sam Killem had watched it all from the corner of the parade  ground.  For him it was an anxious moment.  He was a broad-minded  Australian who realised the need of experienced Britishers like Jones  for the training of his men.  But he was also aware of the national  prejudice against the imported man.  If Jones had adopted the usual way  in the British regiment, that is, clapping the offender in the guard  room and formally charging him with \"insubordination in the ranks,\" Sam  knew that his prestige as a sergeant-major would have dropped fifty per  cent.  However, he was well pleased to see him handle the man in the  Australian manner.    \"Made good that time, Jones,\" said the colonel with a dry grin as the  sergeant-major came forward.    \"That's the only way with these men, sir.\"    \"Glad you know it.  By the way, I know that man.  He half killed one of  the Mounted Police two years ago.  He's three-quarters blackguard and  one-quarter of a good fellow; but we'll make a man of him.  Put him in  orders to-night for the lance stripe.  I always believe in making  N.C.O.'s out of these rascals.\"    \"Splendid idea, sir,\" said the sergeant-major, saluting and falling out.    Next day Lance-Corporal Grouse commenced a new career--that of a  gallant soldier and an Australian gentleman.    Another interesting incident occurred during the training.  Side by  side with the Kangaroo Marines lay the Melbourne Nuts, a battalion of  superior persons.  You see, the Kangaroo Marines were nominally a  Sydney crowd.  Therefore the Melbourne boys showered on them all the  envy which Melbourne has for Sydney.  To understand this point  thoroughly you must have lived in Australia.  Between Melbourne and  Sydney there exists a feud as fierce as an Italian vendetta.  This  animosity crystallises the more general hatred of the respective  States--Victoria and New South Wales.  Both sides think they are the  Lord's Anointed.  A Governor-General in any speech must be careful to  whitewash both States with the same degree of eyewash.  Friendships,  fortunes, and reputations have been lost in this really amusing  controversy.  Indeed, they are like the farmers of Kerry--they go to  law if a hen roosts for a second in the enemy's barnyard.    Picture the scene then--two corps side by side, and imagine the  language.  The first trouble arose through a pioneer of the Kangaroos  dropping a shovelful of dirt in the lines of the Melbourne men.  The  offender was Bill Buster.    \"Get out of this, ye Sydney rattlesnake,\" chirped a youth, looking out  of his tent.    \"Worm!\" exclaimed Bill contemptuously.    \"Ye dirty-necked beachcomber, I'll split yer pumpkin head.\"    \"Take that,\" shouted Bill, throwing a shovelful of manure into the tent  of his aggressor.  Honour, of course, had to be satisfied after that.  The Melbourne man got a broken nose, and Bill had two lovely black eyes.    Both regiments decided to have revenge, and, for that purpose, secret  meetings were called.  The Melbourne boys decided to leave their  affairs in the hands of Happy Harry, a local comedian.  He was given  liberty to spend anything up to twenty pounds on a scheme of revenge.  In the case of the Kangaroos it was decided by ballot that Bill would  plan out something to stagger the Melbourne crowd.  Meantime, armed  neutrality reigned; yet the air seemed charged with the spirit of  friction and the feeling of secret preparation.  Remarkable to relate,  both schemes panned out on the morning of the same day.  The Melbourne  Nuts woke up to see, in great, black, varnished letters, across their  huge dining-tent, the following:               MELBOURNE               IS A           ONE-EYED TOWN              FULL OF         SNIVELLING SNOBS,    PAWNSHOPS, AND GROG SALOONS.      This was a good stroke for the Sydney men, but the Melbourne men had,  also, a neat revenge.  That morning, an old broken-down donkey was  found wandering in the Kangaroos' lines, with placards flapping at his  sides, on which the Sydney men saw:       THIS IS THE FATHER       OF SYDNEY AND    THE KANGAROO MARINES.      The battle of wits was a drawn affair.  But, that night, more trouble  ensued.  While the famous quartette were casually strolling through the  town a Melbourne man jostled Sandy.    \"Wha are ye pushin'?\" he inquired.    \"I'll push yer face for you--you bag of haggis,\" replied the cool  Melbourne lad.    \"Ye daur meddle wi' me,\" said Sandy, leering at him, for he had tasted  deep of the national fluid.  \"Hit me!\" he roared, baring his chest  towards his aggressor.  \"Ma fit is on ma native heath, an' ma name's  M'Greegor,\" continued the fierce, red-whiskered Scot.    \"Here's one for you, M'Greegor!\"  And the Melbourne man let fly.  Poor  Sandy, he buckled up and fell gasping to the ground.  Bill now set to,  but in a minute he, Claud, and Paddy were surrounded by a gang of  Melbourne hands.    \"Ye miserable spalpeens,\" said Paddy, laying to with a great big stick,  and between times whipping the treasures from the pockets of fallen  men.  Claud had his monocle smashed and his nose burst, while poor old  Bill was severely winded just as reinforcements arrived from the  Kangaroos.  It was a bloody combat.  Indeed, it might have been a  serious riot had Sam Killem not doubled up a company with buckets of  water to throw over the antagonists.    Then the bugle call to assembly ended the first and last fight between  these two corps.  Afterwards they were loyal friends, and, in action,  died nobly side by side.          CHAPTER III    THE LAND OF SIN    Egypt is the land of heroes and engineers--also the land of mystery,  the abode of intrigue, the cockpit of puerile nationalism, and the soul  of all things topsy-turvy and contrary.  It is a land for a brave  soldier, a skilful engineer, or the tourist in search of Rameses'  shin-bones.    It is a country wet with British blood and paved with British gold.  The noblest things in Egypt are British; the vilest are the products of  aliens who have dodged justice and cleanness through the vagaries of  \"The Capitulations\" (an international treaty which makes John Bull pay  for the privilege of entertaining alien murderers, white slavers,  forgers, assassins, corrupt financiers, and legal twisters).  But it is  a land worth holding, not so much for any riches it may possess, but  for the Suez Canal, which links us to our Indian Empire.    The Egyptians, on the whole, are an industrious and harmless people.  For centuries they have been slaves to Greeks, Romans, Persians, Turks,  and Crusaders from every land.  They have been doomed to serve because  of their inability to lead and control.  They are content to serve so  long as justice reigns.  Egypt to-day is better governed, more  prosperous, happier than it has ever been in its history.   Cromer,  Kitchener, the Tommy, the Engineer, and the men of the \"Egyptian Civil\"  have given their noblest efforts to crush corruption, to kill decay, to  make the native full-fed and serene.
