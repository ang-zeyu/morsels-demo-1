It was just a  passing fancy that never meant anything. Maud has got over that  long ago.\"    \"She didn't seem to think so.\"    \"Now, Reggie,\" said Lady Caroline tensely, \"please listen to me.  You know that the castle will be full of people in a day or two for  Percy's coming-of-age, and this next few days may be your last  chance of having a real, long, private talk with Maud. I shall be  seriously annoyed if you neglect this opportunity. There is no  excuse for the way you are behaving. Maud is a charming girl--\"    \"Oh, absolutely! One of the best.\"    \"Very well, then!\"    \"But, mater, what I mean to say is--\"    \"I don't want any more temporizing, Reggie!\"    \"No, no! Absolutely not!\" said Reggie dutifully, wishing he knew  what the word meant, and wishing also that life had not become so  frightfully complex.    \"Now, this afternoon, why should you not take Maud for a long ride  in your car?\"    Reggie grew more cheerful. At least he had an answer for that.    \"Can't be done, I'm afraid. I've got to motor into town to meet  Percy. He's arriving from Oxford this morning. I promised to meet  him in town and tool him back in the car.\"    \"I see. Well, then, why couldn't you--?\"    \"I say, mater, dear old soul,\" said Reggie hastily, \"I think you'd  better tear yourself away and what not. If you're catching the  twelve-fifteen, you ought to be staggering round to see you haven't  forgotten anything. There's the car coming round now.\"    \"I wish now I had decided to go by a later train.\"    \"No, no, mustn't miss the twelve-fifteen. Good, fruity train.  Everybody speaks well of it. Well, see you anon, mater. I think  you'd better run like a hare.\"    \"You will remember what I said?\"    \"Oh, absolutely!\"    \"Good-bye, then. I shall be back tomorrow.\"    Reggie returned slowly to his stone seat. He breathed a little  heavily as he felt for his cigarette case. He felt like a hunted  fawn.    Maud came out of the house as the car disappeared down the long  avenue of elms. She crossed the terrace to where Reggie sat  brooding on life and its problem.    \"Reggie!\"    Reggie turned.    \"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing. Take a seat.\"    Maud sat down beside him. There was a flush on her pretty face, and  when she spoke her voice quivered with suppressed excitement.    \"Reggie,\" she said, laying a small hand on his arm. \"We're friends,  aren't we?\"    Reggie patted her back paternally. There were few people he liked  better than Maud.    \"Always have been since the dear old days of childhood, what!\"    \"I can trust you, can't I?\"    \"Absolutely!\"    \"There's something I want you to do for me, Reggie. You'll have to  keep it a dead secret of course.\"    \"The strong, silent man. That's me. What is it?\"    \"You're driving into town in your car this afternoon, aren't you,  to meet Percy?\"    \"That was the idea.\"    \"Could you go this morning instead--and take me?\"    \"Of course.\"    Maud shook her head.    \"You don't know what you are letting yourself in for, Reggie, or  I'm sure you wouldn't agree so lightly. I'm not allowed to leave  the castle, you know, because of what I was telling you about.\"    \"The chappie?\"    \"Yes. So there would be terrible scenes if anybody found out.\"    \"Never mind, dear old soul. I'll risk it. None shall learn your  secret from these lips.\"    \"You're a darling, Reggie.\"    \"But what's the idea? Why do you want to go today particularly?\"    Maud looked over her shoulder.    \"Because--\" She lowered her voice, though there was no one near.  \"Because he is back in London! He's a sort of secretary, you know,  Reggie, to his uncle, and I saw in the paper this morning that the  uncle returned yesterday after a long voyage in his yacht. So--he  must have come back, too. He has to go everywhere his uncle goes.\"    \"And everywhere the uncle went, the chappie was sure to go!\"  murmured Reggie. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\"    \"I must see him. I haven't seen him since last summer--nearly a  whole year! And he hasn't written to me, and I haven't dared to  write to him, for fear of the letter going wrong. So, you see, I  must go. Today's my only chance. Aunt Caroline has gone away.  Father will be busy in the garden, and won't notice whether I'm  here or not. And, besides, tomorrow it will be too late, because  Percy will be here. He was more furious about the thing than  anyone.\"    \"Rather the proud aristocrat, Percy,\" agreed Reggie. \"I understand  absolutely. Tell me just what you want me to do.\"    \"I want you to pick me up in the car about half a mile down the  road. You can drop me somewhere in Piccadilly. That will be near  enough to where I want to go. But the most important thing is about  Percy. You must persuade him to stay and dine in town and come back  here after dinner. Then I shall be able to get back by an afternoon  train, and no one will know I've been gone.\"    \"That's simple enough, what? Consider it done. When do you want to  start?\"    \"At once.\"    \"I'll toddle round to the garage and fetch the car.\" Reggie  chuckled amusedly. \"Rum thing! The mater's just been telling me I  ought to take you for a drive.\"    \"You are a darling, Reggie, really!\"    Reggie gave her back another paternal pat.    \"I know what it means to be in love, dear old soul. I say, Maud,  old thing, do you find love puts you off your stroke? What I mean  is, does it make you slice your approach-shots?\"    Maud laughed.    \"No. It hasn't had any effect on my game so far. I went round in  eighty-six the other day.\"    Reggie sighed enviously.    \"Women are wonderful!\" he said. \"Well, I'll be legging it and  fetching the car. When you're ready, stroll along down the road and  wait for me.\"                        *   *   *    When he had gone Maud pulled a small newspaper clipping from her  pocket. She had extracted it from yesterday's copy of the Morning  Post's society column. It contained only a few words:          \"Mr. Wilbur Raymond has returned to his residence at      No. 11a Belgrave Square from a prolonged voyage in his      yacht, the Siren.\"    Maud did not know Mr. Wilbur Raymond, and yet that paragraph had  sent the blood tingling through every vein in her body. For as she  had indicated to Reggie, when the Wilbur Raymonds of this world  return to their town residences, they bring with them their nephew  and secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. And Geoffrey Raymond was the man  Maud had loved ever since the day when she had met him in Wales.        CHAPTER 2.    The sun that had shone so brightly on Belpher Castle at noon, when  Maud and Reggie Byng set out on their journey, shone on the  West-End of London with equal pleasantness at two o'clock. In  Little Gooch Street all the children of all the small shopkeepers  who support life in that backwater by selling each other vegetables  and singing canaries were out and about playing curious games of  their own invention. Cats washed themselves on doorsteps,  preparatory to looking in for lunch at one of the numerous garbage  cans which dotted the sidewalk. Waiters peered austerely from the  windows of the two Italian restaurants which carry on the Lucretia  Borgia tradition by means of one shilling and sixpenny _table d'hote_  luncheons. The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was  bidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a  dauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having  outlived its utility. On all these things the sun shone with a  genial smile. Round the corner, in Shaftesbury Avenue, an east wind  was doing its best to pierce the hardened hides of the citizenry;  but it did not penetrate into Little Gooch Street, which, facing  south and being narrow and sheltered, was enabled practically to  bask.    Mac, the stout guardian of the stage door of the Regal Theatre,  whose gilded front entrance is on the Avenue, emerged from the  little glass case in which the management kept him, and came out to  observe life and its phenomena with an indulgent eye. Mac was  feeling happy this morning. His job was a permanent one, not  influenced by the success or failure of the productions which  followed one another at the theatre throughout the year; but he  felt, nevertheless, a sort of proprietary interest in these  ventures, and was pleased when they secured the approval of the  public. Last night's opening, a musical piece by an American  author and composer, had undoubtedly made a big hit, and Mac was  glad, because he liked what he had seen of the company, and, in the  brief time in which he had known him, had come to entertain a warm  regard for George Bevan, the composer, who had travelled over from  New York to help with the London production.    George Bevan turned the corner now, walking slowly, and, it seemed  to Mac, gloomily towards the stage door. He was a young man of  about twenty-seven, tall and well knit, with an agreeable,  clean-cut face, of which a pair of good and honest eyes were the  most noticeable feature. His sensitive mouth was drawn down a  little at the corners, and he looked tired.    \"Morning, Mac.\"    \"Good morning, sir.\"    \"Anything for me?\"    \"Yes, sir. Some telegrams. I'll get 'em. Oh, I'll _get_ 'em,\" said  Mac, as if reassuring some doubting friend and supporter as to his  ability to carry through a labour of Hercules.    He disappeared into his glass case. George Bevan remained outside  in the street surveying the frisking children with a sombre glance.  They seemed to him very noisy, very dirty and very young.  Disgustingly young. Theirs was joyous, exuberant youth which made a  fellow feel at least sixty. Something was wrong with George today,  for normally he was fond of children. Indeed, normally he was fond  of most things. He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who  liked life and the great majority of those who lived it  contemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many  friends."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22344"],[0,"Remarks on the Subject of Lactation (#3)"],[1," last remains of  strength--producing a state which may easily be mistaken for, or  terminate in, true pulmonary consumption;--finally, the sight becomes  progressively weaker, until vision is almost destroyed; the eyelids  exude a glutinous secretion, and ophthalmia itself is occasionally  induced.    These are the symptoms too often caused by lactation in delicate or  debilitated habits, even a few months after delivery; the same also are  observed when suckling has been injudiciously protracted beyond the  period to which it should be confined.    A few only of the foregoing symptoms may be noticed, or nearly the whole  may present themselves, in the same patient; and when this happens,  unless the cause which has given rise to them be at once detected, and  appropriate treatment employed, the most serious consequences may be  apprehended.    In these cases, the first step necessary is to discontinue the suckling  altogether: half measures will never answer. Sometimes it is proposed by  the patient, or her friends (more usually the latter), to compromise the  affair by feeding the child partly on spoon meat, and allowing him still  to take the breast, though less frequently than before.    This plan I uniformly object to, for the following reasons:--    1st. Because the mother will not be likely to recover so long as she  continues to suckle at all.    2nd. Because her milk being necessarily of a bad quality, it cannot be  expected that the child will derive benefit from it; but, on the  contrary, there is every probability that his health will suffer by  using diet of such an improper description.    The obvious dependence of the foregoing symptoms upon debility will, of  course, at once suggest to practitioners the nature of the treatment to  be adopted: which should be such as is calculated to invigorate the  system generally--namely, the administration of tonics, &c.    Bark and its various preparations, especially the sulphate of quinine,  with the occasional use of warm aperients (sedulously avoiding the more  violent purgatives), will be found eminently successful; whereas,  cupping at the nape of the neck (which I have seen prescribed for the  headache), and other depletory measures, have proved as manifestly  injurious.    'Every disease productive of great weakness is increased by the state of  the system which follows child-bearing. Of this description are  consumption, dropsy,' &c. In these cases it is evident that the process  of lactation, by adding to the debility already present, must prove  highly injurious, and consequently should be always avoided.    I have already noticed the effects which are produced upon the milk by  the influence of mental emotions on the part of the mother, as well as  by the recurrence of the periodical appearance; and since these are  chiefly injurious to the child, by depraving its sustenance, their  further consideration will be deferred till the next chapter.    With respect to the remaining topic--namely, the occurrence of  miscarriage from suckling--I am convinced that it is by no means an  unfrequent accident, though its real cause is perhaps rarely suspected,  having only met with one patient who considered the mishap in question  to have arisen from keeping her child too long at the breast. Having  already, I trust satisfactorily, explained the manner in which abortion  is produced by the act of suckling, I shall conclude this part of my  subject with the relation of a case that occurred in private practice,  which so strongly corroborates many of the observations in the preceding  and following pages, that I shall offer no apology for its introduction:  more particularly, since the lady herself to whom it refers has  benevolently expressed a wish for its publication, in order that those  who become acquainted with the facts there detailed may be prevented  from undergoing similar unnecessary sufferings:--      CASE.    Mrs. A----, a lady of delicate constitution, about twenty years of age,  three or four months subsequent to the birth of her first child, began  to find her milk gradually lessen in quantity; it had also much changed  from its previous appearance, resembling at the time just stated, a  yellowish, turbid serum. Her child became emaciated; and diarrh[oe]a  supervening, my professional services were required. My advice was, that  the child should be at once weaned, and a suitable wet-nurse, if  possible, procured--neither of which suggestions, as will shortly  appear, were followed. I urged the necessity of this measure more  particularly, because Mrs. A---- was daily getting thinner and weaker;  she also complained of great pain in the head and back, and of an  increasing dimness of sight, which made her fear she should become  blind; but the mother-in-law of my patient being, unfortunately, of  opinion that pregnancy in the latter would not again occur during the  continuance of lactation, recommended that the child, although chiefly  supported upon spoon-meat, should occasionally be allowed to take the  breast; and this plan, notwithstanding the wish of Mrs. A---- to the  contrary, and my own remonstrances on the subject, was adopted--the  effects of which were to increase the mother's ailments, as well as  those of her infant. Things went on thus for some time longer, when I  once more endeavoured to persuade Mrs. A---- to follow my advice,  observing, that by an opposite line of conduct she was not only injuring  her own health, but that of her child, neither of which, I assured her,  in my opinion, would be re-established till the latter had been weaned.  I expressed also my complete incredulity as to the non-recurrence of  pregnancy in consequence of her infant remaining at the breast; and I  added--'It is my firm conviction that if you be pregnant, or should  happen shortly to become so, you will miscarry.' About a week after  this conversation she was suddenly seized with flooding, and what I had  predicted took place. She now left off suckling, and in about a month,  under suitable treatment, completely got rid of all her former  complaints: the child also immediately began to improve.    The present case clearly proves that the process of lactation will not  _invariably_ prevent the occurrence of pregnancy, since Mrs. A---- became  in this state, notwithstanding she continued to suckle her child: and I  think few will be so hardy as to doubt that it was the cause of her  miscarrying: more particularly when I mention that, at a future period,  the same lady, during my absence abroad, being once more persuaded to  try whether she could not avoid becoming pregnant (which was very much  to be desired, on account of her delicate state of health) by continuing  to perform the duties of a nurse, again suffered all the distressing  symptoms before described, and again miscarried.    This case, finally, affords evidence of the evil consequences often  produced in children by impoverished and unhealthy milk; and of their  speedy disappearance when the exciting cause--namely, deteriorated  milk--is no longer afforded.          CHAPTER III.    _On the various Diseases which frequently arise in Children from  Lactation, especially when protracted._      Having thus briefly considered some of the disorders to which women are  subjected by performing the first duty imposed upon them as mothers, I  shall next advert to those which are very frequently observed in their  children from being suckled during too long a period; or in consequence  of the nurse's milk becoming either simply impoverished, or of a  positively injurious quality.    These diseases are numerous, and some of them serious, among which may  be enumerated the following; namely, vomiting, diarrh[oe]a, general  debility, scrofula, tabes mesenterica,--rickets, convulsions,  epilepsy,--and lastly meningitis, or that peculiar inflammation of the  investing membranes of the brain which gives rise to the effusion of  serum, constituting the well known and very fatal disease termed by  medical practitioners Hydrocephalus, or Hydrencephalus, and popularly  Water on the Brain.    The disease last mentioned being by far the most important, and that  chiefly referred to in the following observations, I shall commence with  a brief statement of the conclusions which my experience has led me to  form respecting it; they are the same I made public four years ago[E],  having since that time seen no reason to make any alteration in them. I  believe,    1st,--That if children be suckled for an undue length of time[F], they  will be liable in consequence to be affected with meningitis[G], or  inflammation of the investing membranes of the brain.    2dly,--That should they not become affected with the disorder in  question during or soon after the time they are thus improperly suckled,  they will nevertheless acquire therefrom a predisposition to cephalic  disease at some future period of their lives.    3dly,--That children who are suckled for an undue length of time, when  labouring under other diseases, will be much more liable to have the  head secondarily affected, than children brought up in a different  manner.    4thly,--And lastly, that the same effects will take place in infants if  suckled by women who have been delivered an undue[H] length of time;  although the infants themselves may not have been at the breast for too  long a period.           *       *       *       *       *    CASES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE FOREGOING VIEWS.
