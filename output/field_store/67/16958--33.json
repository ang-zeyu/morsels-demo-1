Equally numerous, and not less important, are the difficulties that  confront the emotional life of the young. Must not one suppose that  parents should be united to children by the most tender and delicate  chords? One should suppose it; yet, sad as it may be, it is,  nevertheless, true, that parents are the first to destroy the inner  riches of their children.    The Scriptures tell us that God created Man in His own image, which has  by no means proven a success. Parents follow the bad example of their  heavenly master; they use every effort to shape and mould the child  according to their image. They tenaciously cling to the idea that the  child is merely part of themselves--an idea as false as it is injurious,  and which only increases the misunderstanding of the soul of the child,  of the necessary consequences of enslavement and subordination thereof.    As soon as the first rays of consciousness illuminate the mind and heart  of the child, it instinctively begins to compare its own personality  with the personality of those about it. How many hard and cold stone  cliffs meet its large wondering gaze? Soon enough it is confronted with  the painful reality that it is here only to serve as inanimate matter  for parents and guardians, whose authority alone gives it shape and  form.    The terrible struggle of the thinking man and woman against political,  social and moral conventions owes its origin to the family, where the  child is ever compelled to battle against the internal and external use  of force. The categorical imperatives: You shall! you must! this is  right! that is wrong! this is true! that is false! shower like a violent  rain upon the unsophisticated head of the young being and impress upon  its sensibilities that it has to bow before the long established and  hard notions of thoughts and emotions. Yet the latent qualities and  instincts seek to assert their own peculiar methods of seeking the  foundation of things, of distinguishing between what is commonly called  wrong, true or false. It is bent upon going its own way, since it is  composed of the same nerves, muscles and blood, even as those who assume  to direct its destiny. I fail to understand how parents hope that their  children will ever grow up into independent, self-reliant spirits, when  they strain every effort to abridge and curtail the various activities  of their children, the plus in quality and character, which  differentiates their offspring from themselves, and by the virtue of  which they are eminently equipped carriers of new, invigorating ideas. A  young delicate tree, that is being clipped and cut by the gardener in  order to give it an artificial form, will never reach the majestic  height and the beauty as when allowed to grow in nature and freedom.    When the child reaches adolescence, it meets, added to the home and  school restrictions, with a vast amount of hard traditions of social  morality. The cravings of love and sex are met with absolute ignorance  by the majority of parents, who consider it as something indecent and  improper, something disgraceful, almost criminal, to be suppressed and  fought like some terrible disease. The love and tender feelings in the  young plant are turned into vulgarity and coarseness through the  stupidity of those surrounding it, so that everything fine and beautiful  is either crushed altogether or hidden in the innermost depths, as a  great sin, that dares not face the light.    What is more astonishing is the fact that parents will strip themselves  of everything, will sacrifice everything for the physical well-being of  their child, will wake nights and stand in fear and agony before some  physical ailment of their beloved one; but will remain cold and  indifferent, without the slightest understanding before the soul  cravings and the yearnings of their child, neither hearing nor wishing  to hear the loud knocking of the young spirit that demands recognition.  On the contrary, they will stifle the beautiful voice of spring, of a  new life of beauty and splendor of love; they will put the long lean  finger of authority upon the tender throat and not allow vent to the  silvery song of the individual growth, of the beauty of character, of  the strength of love and human relation, which alone make life worth  living.    And yet these parents imagine that they mean best for the child, and for  aught I know, some really do; but their best means absolute death and  decay to the bud in the making. After all, they are but imitating their  own masters in State, commercial, social and moral affairs, by forcibly  suppressing every independent attempt to analyze the ills of society and  every sincere effort toward the abolition of these ills; never able to  grasp the eternal truth that every method they employ serves as the  greatest impetus to bring forth a greater longing for freedom and a  deeper zeal to fight for it.    That compulsion is bound to awaken resistance, every parent and teacher  ought to know. Great surprise is being expressed over the fact that the  majority of children of radical parents are either altogether opposed to  the ideas of the latter, many of them moving along the old antiquated  paths, or that they are indifferent to the new thoughts and teachings of  social regeneration. And yet there is nothing unusual in that. Radical  parents, though emancipated from the belief of ownership in the human  soul, still cling tenaciously to the notion that they own the child, and  that they have the right to exercise their authority over it. So they  set out to mould and form the child according to their own conception of  what is right and wrong, forcing their ideas upon it with the same  vehemence that the average Catholic parent uses. And, with the latter,  they hold out the necessity before the young \"to do as I tell you and  not as I do.\" But the impressionable mind of the child realizes early  enough that the lives of their parents are in contradiction to the ideas  they represent; that, like the good Christian who fervently prays on  Sunday, yet continues to break the Lord's commands the rest of the week,  the radical parent arraigns God, priesthood, church, government,  domestic authority, yet continues to adjust himself to the condition he  abhors. Just so, the Freethought parent can proudly boast that his son  of four will recognize the picture of Thomas Paine or Ingersoll, or that  he knows that the idea of God is stupid. Or that the Social Democratic  father can point to his little girl of six and say, \"Who wrote the  Capital, dearie?\" \"Karl Marx, pa!\" Or that the Anarchistic mother can  make it known that her daughter's name is Louise Michel, Sophia  Perovskaya, or that she can recite the revolutionary poems of Herwegh,  Freiligrath, or Shelley, and that she will point out the faces of  Spencer, Bakunin or Moses Harmon almost anywhere.    These are by no means exaggerations; they are sad facts that I have met  with in my experience with radical parents. What are the results of such  methods of biasing the mind? The following is the consequence, and not  very infrequent, either. The child, being fed on one-sided, set and  fixed ideas, soon grows weary of re-hashing the beliefs of its parents,  and it sets out in quest of new sensations, no matter how inferior and  shallow the new experience may be, the human mind cannot endure sameness  and monotony. So it happens that that boy or girl, over-fed on Thomas  Paine, will land in the arms of the Church, or they will vote for  imperialism only to escape the drag of economic determinism and  scientific socialism, or that they open a shirt-waist factory and cling  to their right of accumulating property, only to find relief from the  old-fashioned communism of their father. Or that the girl will marry the  next best man, provided he can make a living, only to run away from the  everlasting talk on variety.    Such a condition of affairs may be very painful to the parents who wish  their children to follow in their path, yet I look upon them as very  refreshing and encouraging psychological forces. They are the greatest  guarantee that the independent mind, at least, will always resist every  external and foreign force exercised over the human heart and head.    Some will ask, what about weak natures, must they not be protected? Yes,  but to be able to do that, it will be necessary to realize that  education of children is not synonymous with herdlike drilling and  training. If education should really mean anything at all, it must  insist upon the free growth and development of the innate forces and  tendencies of the child. In this way alone can we hope for the free  individual and eventually also for a free community, which shall make  interference and coercion of human growth impossible.    [Illustration]          HOPE AND FEAR.[A]    (Translated from the Jewish of L. I. PERETZ.)      ...My heart is with you.

Through this venture he was to  spread his knowledge of mechanical wool carding throughout the country.      The Scholfield Machines    The first record of Arthur's sale of carding machines appeared in the  _Pittsfield Sun_ in September 1803. The next year, in May 1804, his  advertisement informed the readers that A. Scholfield continued to card  wool, and also that:         He has carding-machines for sale, built under his immediate       inspection, upon a new and improved plan, which he is determined to       sell on the most liberal terms, and will give drafts and other       instructions to those who wish to build for themselves; and       cautions all whom it may concern to beware how they are imposed       upon by uninformed speculating companies, who demand more than       twice as much for machines as they are really worth.    Scholfield must have felt that some of his competitors were charging  much more for their carding machines than they were worth. Also, others  were producing inferior machines that did not card the wool properly.  Both factors encouraged Arthur to continue the commercial production of  wool-carding machines. In April 1805 he again advertised:         Good news for farmers, only eight cents per pound for picking,       greasing, and carding white wool, and twelve and a half cents for       mixed. For sale, Double Carding-machines, upon a new and improved       plan, good and cheap.    And in 1806:         Double carding machines, made and sold by A. Scholfield for $253       each, without the cards, or $400 including the cards. Picking       machines at $30 each. Wool carded on the same terms as last year,       viz.: eight cents per pound for white, and twelve and a half cents       for mixed, no credit given.    With both carpenters and machinists working under his direction, he soon  abandoned completely the carding of wool and devoted his full time to  producing carding machines. An advertisement in the _Pittsfield Sun_  shows Alexander and Elisha Ely providing carding service there with a  Scholfield machine in 1806. Scholfield machines were also set up in  Massachusetts at Bethuel Baker, Jr., & Co. in Lanesborough in 1805, at  Walker & Worthington in Lenox, at Curtis's Mills in Stockbridge, at  Reuben Judd & Co. in Williamstown, in Lee at the falls near the forge,  at Bairds' Mills in Bethlehem in 1806, and by John Hart in Cheshire in  1807. Subsequently many more Scholfield machines were set up in many  other places as far away as Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1809 and Mason  Village, New Hampshire, in about 1810.    One of the difficulties that Arthur encountered in building these early  machines was in cutting the comb plates that freed the carded fleece  from the cylinder. These plates had to be prepared by hand, the teeth  being cut and filed one by one. In 1814 James Standring, an old friend  and co-worker, smuggled into this country a \"teeth-cutting machine,\"  which he had procured on a trip to England.[12] Standring kept the  machine closely guarded, permitting only Scholfield and one other  friend to see it. Standring used his machine to make new saws of all  descriptions and to re-cut old ones as well as to prepare comb plates  for the carding machines. But in spite of this new simplified method of  producing comb plates Scholfield's business did not flourish, for the  tremendous influx of foreign fabrics after the War of 1812 greatly  damaged the domestic textile industries, including the manufacture of  carding machines.    By 1818 Scholfield's friends had persuaded him to apply to Congress for  relief. To his brother John on April 20, 1818, he wrote:         ... I have been advised by my friends to apply to Congress by a       petition as we were the first that introduced the woolen Business       by Machinery in this country and should that plan be adopted I have       but little hopes of success but they say if it does no good it wont       doo any harm but at any rate I should like your opinion and advice       about it....    Apparently John felt the plan would not succeed, for on the following  December 17 Arthur wrote him again:         ... With regard to applying to Congress I have given that up for I       am of your opinion that it won't succeed what gave me some hopes I       was advis'd to it by a member of the Senet who is a very       influential man in Congress but he is now out and I think tis best       to drop it....    Arthur never applied to Congress for the recognition his contemporaries  felt he deserved.[13]    Several changes in the construction of wool-carding machines took place  during this period. As early as 1816 John Scholfield, Jr., was reported  to have in his mill in Jewett City, Connecticut, a double-cylinder  carding machine 3 feet wide. And in 1822 a Worcester, Massachusetts,  machine maker advertised that he was \"constructing carding machines  entirely of iron.\"[14] Although a few of these iron carding machines  were sold, they did not become common until 50 years later.[15]    There is no record that Arthur Scholfield manufactured carding machines  of a width greater than 24 inches, or entirely of iron. However, little  is known of his last business years except that he remained in  Pittsfield until his death, March 27, 1827.    Only three wool-carding machines attributed to the hands of the  Scholfields are known to exist today. All are 24-inch, single-cylinder  carding machines of the same general description (see fig. 8). They  differ only in minor respects that probably result from subsequent  changes and additions. One (fig. 9), now located in the Plymouth Carding  House, at Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan, was discovered in  Ware, Massachusetts. Another (fig. 10), now at Old Sturbridge Village,  Sturbridge, Massachusetts,[16] was uncovered in a barn in northern New  Hampshire. The third (fig. 1), is in the U.S. National Museum in the  collection of the Division of Textiles.    Both it and the Dearborn machine have in former times been described as  \"the original Scholfield woolen card.\" It is a romantic but  unsubstantiated idea that either of these is the first Scholfield  carding machine set up in the Byfield factory in 1794. The author's  opinion is that all three were built by Arthur Scholfield during his  years in the Pittsfield factory. Examination of the National Museum  machine supports this opinion. The woods used are all native to the New  England region. The frame, the large cylinder and the roller called the  fancy are constructed of eastern white pine (the Sturbridge machine is  also constructed principally of pine). The joints of the main frame are  mortised and tenoned. At the doffing end the main frame and cross  supports are numbered and matched, I to IIII, and at the feed end they  are numbered V to VIII but were mis-matched in the original assembly.  Further rigidity is achieved by means of hand-forged lag screws. The  arch of the frame is birch and the arch arm maple. The 14-inch doffer  roller is made of chestnut.[17] The iron shafts are square and turned  down at the bearings. The worker rollers are fitted with sprockets and  turned by a hand-forged chain. The comb plate, stamped \"Standring,\" is  hand filed, and is undoubtedly one of those made before the  \"teeth-cutting machine\" was smuggled from England, for although  one-third of the plate is quite regular, the size and pitch of the teeth  in the remaining two-thirds are irregular. Part of this irregularity  might be explained as having been caused by the hand-sharpening of a  plate originally cut by machine, but the teeth in one 2-inch span not  only vary in size but have a pitch that would have been impossible to  produce after the original plate had been made.[18]    There is no doubt that this carding machine was made by Arthur  Scholfield, or under his immediate supervision, sometime between 1803  and 1814. It may well be one of the machines sent to southern New  Hampshire in 1809 or 1810, as it is known to have been run in Nashua and  Jeffrey, New Hampshire, in the 1820's and 1830's, after which it was run  by James Townsend in Marlboro, New Hampshire, from 1837 until 1890, when  it was exhibited at the Mechanics Fair in Boston. Mr. Rufus S. Frost  purchased the machine and owned it until his death in 1897. When the  Frost estate was settled, the old Scholfield wool-carding machine was  purchased by the Davis & Furber Machine Co., by which in 1954 it was  presented to the National Museum.    The disappearance of the original Scholfield carding machine is  regrettable, but fortunately the Scholfields' importance to the American  woolen industry does not depend on their having produced this one  machine. These brothers, arriving here at a critical time in our  nation's history, made important contributions to our economic and to  our technological progress--John by his mill operations, Arthur by his  ultimate work of constructing wool-carding machines for sale. Of these  two aspects, it is the contribution of Arthur that has had the more  far-reaching effect, for he spread his expert knowledge of mechanical  wool carding, in the form of machines, throughout the New England woolen  centers. His machines now stand as monuments to the work of both.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] The same type of hand cards were also used for cotton in Colonial  America, but because the cotton fibers were not laid parallel in the  sliver only coarse yarns could be spun. In ancient Peru the fibers for  spinning fine cotton yarns were prepared with the fingers alone. In  India the cotton fibers were combed with the fine-toothed jawbone of the  boalee fish before the fibers were removed from the seed. (J.F.
