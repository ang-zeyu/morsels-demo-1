Across the Old Town we meet the North Sea mist blowing up The Bridges,  fighting high up with the tall arc lights. What variety of colour there  is and movement; the lights of the shops flood the lower part of the  street and buildings with a warm orange, there are emerald, ruby, and  yellow lights in the apothecary's windows, primary colours and  complementary, direct and reflected from the wet pavements; the clothes  of passing people run from blue-black to brown and dull red against the  glow, and there's a girl's scarlet hat and an emerald green  signboard--choice of tints and no mistake--we will take the lot for a  first illustration, and in London perhaps, we will get another street  scene or two, and so on; as we go south and east we will pick up  pictures along the road--from Edinburgh to Mandalay with coloured  pictures all the way, notes of the outside of things only, no inner  meanings guaranteed--the reflections on the shop windows as it  were--anyone can see the things inside.    [Illustration: A Glimpse of the North Sea]    An old friend met us at the station; he had just heard of our exodus and  came to wish us good-bye as we used to do in school-days, when we  considered a journey to England was rather an event. He spoke of  \"Tigers;\" India and tigers are bracketed in his mind, and I am certain  he would get tiger-shooting somehow or other if he were to go East; he  looked a little surprised and sad when I affirmed that I went rather to  paint and see things than to shoot. Shooting and other sports we can  have at home, and after all, is not trying to see things and depict them  the most exciting form of sport? I am sure it is as interesting; and  that more skill and quickness of hand and eye is required to catch with  brush or pen point a flying impression from a cab window or the train  than in potting stripes in a jungle.    Look you--this I call sport! To catch this nocturne in the train, the  exact tint of the blue-black night, framed in the window of our lamp-lit  carriage; or the soft night effect on field and cliff and sea as we  pass. No academical pot shot this, for we are swinging south down the  east coast past Cockburnspath (Coppath, the natives call it) at sixty  miles the hour, so we must be quick to get any part of the night firmly  impressed. There is faint moonlight through low clouds (the night for  flighting duck), the land blurred, and you can hardly see the farmer's  handiwork on the stubbles; there are trees and a homestead massed in  shadow, with a lamp-lit window, lemon yellow against the calm  lead-coloured sea, and a soft broad band of white shows straight down  the coast where the surf tumbles, each breaker catches a touch of  silvery moonlight. The foam looks soft as wool, but I know two nights  ago, an iron ship was torn to bits on the red rocks it covers.... I must  get this down in colour to-morrow in my attic under the tiles of the  Coburg. Who knows--some day it may be worth a tiger's skin (with the  frame included).... There is the light now on the Farnes, and Holy  Island we can dimly make out.    To the right we look to see if the bison at Haggerston are showing their  great heads above the low mists on the fields.... The night is cold,  there is the first touch of winter in the air. It is time to knock out  my pipe and turn in, to dream of India's coral strand, as we roll away  south across the level fields of England.    [Illustration: A Glimpse of the North Sea]    In London town we arrive very early; an early Sunday morning in  autumn in the East of London is not the most delightful time to be  there. It is smelly and sordid, and the streets are almost empty of  people, but I notice two tall young men in rags, beating up either side  of a street, their hands deep in their pockets as if they were cold;  they are looking for cigarette ends, I expect, and scraps of food; and  we are driving along very comfortably to our hotel and breakfast. An  hour or two later we are in the park at church-parade; a little pale sun  comes through the smoky air, and a chilly breeze brings the yellow  leaves streaming to the ground. There are gorgeous hats on the lines of  sparrows nests, and manifold draperies and corduroys and ermines and  purple things, with presumably good-looking women inside. We men run to  purple ties this year, quite a plucky contrast to our regulation  toppers, black coats and sober tweed trousers. And one unto the other  says, \"Hillo--you here again! Who'd have expected to see you, dear  fellow! What sort of bag did you get; good sport, eh?\" \"Oh,  good--good--awfully good! Such a good year all round, you know, and  partridges, they say, are splendid; hasn't been such a good season for  years; awfully sorry to miss 'em. And when do you go back?--On the  _Egypt_!--Oh, by Jove! won't there be a crowd! Horrid bore, you  know--'pon my word everyone is goin' East now; you can't get away from  people anywhere! It's the Prince's visit you know; what I mean is, it's  such a draw, don't you know.\"    Monday morning in Regent Street.--Sauntering with St C., looking at the  crowd and incubators and buying things we could probably get just as  well in Bombay; but Indian ink and colours, and these really important  things we dare not leave behind. What a pleasant street it is to saunter  in once or twice in a year or so; what a variety of nationalities and  pretty faces there are to see. The air is fresh and autumnal, and  overhead a northerly breeze blows wisps of white cloud across a bright  blue sky, and just floats out the French Tricolours and the Union Jacks  with which the street is decorated. The houses on one side are in quite  hot sun; the other side of the street is in cold bluey shade, which  extends more than half across the road. A cart crawls up the shaded  side, leaving a track of yellow sand in its wake; someone is coming, and  the crowd waits patiently.... Now mounted police appear in the distant  haze and come trotting towards us, and the guards with glittering  breastplates are rattling past and away in a breath! Then outriders and  a carriage, and a brown face, moustached and bearded, and the Prince  goes by, and the crowd cheers--and I pray we may both get a tiger. Then  the King passes with Lord Minto, I think. We have come to London for  something!    Possibly in the fulness of time we may see kings in our Northern Capital  oftener than we do now. We need ceremonies, a little sand on the street  occasionally, and a parade or two--ceremonies are the expression of  inward feelings; without occasion for the expression of the sentiment of  loyalty, the sense must go ... the loyalty of a second northern  people--going--going--for a little sand and bunting--and--NO OFFER?    [Illustration]    There is no chance of ennui in the week in London before a voyage; you  have packing, shopping, insuring, and buying tickets and general  bustling round--what charming occupations for the contemplative mind!  Then you throw in visits to friends, and acquaintances call on you, all  in the concentrated week; you breakfast late, lunch heavily, rush off to  a hurried dinner somewhere, then rush off to a play or some function or  other, supper somewhere else and then home, too late for half a pipe;  engagements about clothes, hats, dresses, guns, lunches, dinners,  theatres, you have all in your mind, awake and asleep, and as you run  about attending to essentials and superfluities, you jostle with the  collarless man in the street, and note the hungry look, and reflect how  thin is the ice that bears you and how easy it is to go through, just a  step, and you are over the neck--collar gone and the crease out of the  trousers. A friend of mine went through the other day and no one knew;  he lived on brown bread and water for ever so long, but stuck to his  evening clothes, and now he sits in the seats of the mighty. What \"a  Variorem\" it all is--tragedy and comedy written in the lines of faces  and the cut of clothes. But I confess; what interests me in London more  than types or individuals, are the street scenes and figures seen  collectively. What pictures there are at every turning, and yet how  seldom we see them painted. With the utmost modesty in the world I will  have a try in passing at Piccadilly Circus. Is there a street scene so  fascinating as that centre for colour and movement?--say on a May night,  with people going to the theatres, the sky steely blue and ruddy over  the house-tops, the Pavilion and Criterion lights orange and green  glinting on the polished road and flickering on the flying hansom  wheels--or The Circus in a wet night, a whirlpool of moving lights and  shadows and wavering reflections! What a contrast to the quiet effects  in some side street; for example this street seen half in moonlight,  beneath my window in the Coburg; the only sound the click clack of the  busy horse's feet on the wood pavement, as hansoms and carriages flit  round from Berkeley Square--there's a levee to night, and their yellow  lamps string up Mount Street and divide beneath me into Carlos Place.    ... My tailor has sent me such an excellent cardboard box to paint on,  so I will use it for this effect in Muzii colours; it will make a drop  scene or tail piece to this first chapter of these \"Digressions.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Piccadilly Circus, by Night.]          CHAPTER II      LONDON TO TILBURY.--If I am to write notes about a journey to the Far  East, I must not miss out the exciting part between Grosvenor Square and  Liverpool Street Station. The excitement comes in as you watch the  policeman's hand at the block in the city and wonder if it will stop  your journey; down it comes though, and we are in time, and have a  minute to spare to rejoice on the platform with our cousin and niece who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#3)"],[1,"the information that this august  visitor was a Miss Logan, an old an intimate acquaintance of the  laird's, and a very worthy respectable lady, of good connections, whose  parents had lost their patrimony in the civil wars.    \"Ha! very well!\" said the lady; \"very well, Martha! But, nevertheless,  go thou and watch this respectable lady's motions and behaviour the  next time she comes to visit the laird--and the next after that. You  will not, I see, lack opportunities.\"    Martha's information turned out of that nature that prayers were said  in the uppermost story of Dalcastle house against the Canaanitish  woman, every night and every morning; and great discontent prevailed  there, even to anathemas and tears. Letter after letter was dispatched  to Glasgow; and at length, to the lady's great consolation, the Rev.  Mr. Wringhim arrived safely and devoutly in her elevated sanctuary.  Marvellous was the conversation between these gifted people. Wringhim  had held in his doctrines that there were eight different kinds of  FAITH, all perfectly distinct in their operations and effects. But the  lady, in her secluded state, had discovered another five, making twelve  [sic] in all: the adjusting of the existence or fallacy of these five  faiths served for a most enlightened discussion of nearly seventeen  hours; in the course of which the two got warm in their arguments,  always in proportion as they receded from nature, utility, and common  sense. Wringhim at length got into unwonted fervour about some disputed  point between one of these faiths and TRUST: when the lady, fearing  that zeal was getting beyond its wonted barrier, broke in on his  vehement asseverations with the following abrupt discomfiture: \"But,  Sir, as long as I remember, what is to be done with this case of open  and avowed iniquity?\"    The minister was struck dumb. He leaned him back on his chair, stroked  his beard, hemmed--considered, and hemmed again, and then said, in an  altered and softened tone: \"Why, that is a secondary consideration; you  mean the case between your husband and Miss Logan?\"    \"The same, Sir. I am scandalized at such intimacies going on under my  nose. The sufferance of it is a great and crying evil.\"    \"Evil, madam, may be either operative, or passive. To them it is an  evil, but to us none. We have no more to do with the sins of the wicked  and unconverted here than with those of an infidel Turk; for all  earthly bonds and fellowships are absorbed and swallowed up in the holy  community of the Reformed Church. However, if it is your wish, I shall  take him to task, and reprimand and humble him in such a manner that he  shall be ashamed of his doings, and renounce such deeds for ever, out  of mere self-respect, though all unsanctified the heart, as well as the  deed, may be. To the wicked, all things are wicked; but to the just,  all things are just and right.\"    \"Ah, that is a sweet and comfortable saying, Mr. Wringhim! How  delightful to think that a justified person can do no wrong! Who would  not envy the liberty wherewith we are made free? Go to my husband, that  poor unfortunate, blindfolded person, and open his eyes to his  degenerate and sinful state; for well are you fitted to the task.\"    \"Yea, I will go in unto him, and confound him. I will lay the strong  holds of sin and Satan as flat before my face as the dung that is  spread out to fatten the land.\"    \"Master, there's a gentleman at the fore-door wants a private word o'  ye.\"    \"Tell him I'm engaged: I can't see any gentleman to-night. But I shall  attend on him to-morrow as soon as he pleases.\"    \"'He's coming straight in, Sir. Stop a wee bit, Sir, my master is  engaged. He cannot see you at present, Sir.\"    \"Stand aside, thou Moabite! My mission admits of no delay. I come to  save him from the jaws of destruction!\"    \"An that be the case, Sir, it maks a wide difference; an', as the  danger may threaten us a', I fancy I may as weel let ye gang by as  fight wi' ye, sin' ye seem sae intent on 't.--The man says he's comin'  to save ye, an' canna stop, Sir. Here he is.\"    The laird was going to break out into a volley of wrath against Waters,  his servant; but, before he got a word pronounced, the Rev. Mr.  Wringhim had stepped inside the room, and Waters had retired, shutting  the door behind him.    No introduction could be more mal-a-propos: it was impossible; for at  that very moment the laird and Arabella Logan were both sitting on one  seat, and both looking on one book, when the door opened. \"What is it,  Sir?\" said the laird fiercely.    \"A message of the greatest importance, Sir,\" said the divine, striding  unceremoniously up to the chimney, turning his back to the fire, and  his face to the culprits. \"I think you should know me, Sir?\" continued  he, looking displeasedly at the laird, with his face half turned round.    \"I think I should,\" returned the laird. \"You are a Mr.  How's--tey--ca'--him, of Glasgow, who did me the worst turn ever I got  done to me in my life. You gentry are always ready to do a man such a  turn. Pray, Sir, did you ever do a good job for anyone to  counterbalance that? For, if you have not, you ought to be--\"    \"Hold, Sir, I say! None of your profanity before me. If I do evil to  anyone on such occasions, it is because he will have it so; therefore,  the evil is not of my doing. I ask you, Sir, before God and this  witness, I ask you, have you kept solemnly and inviolate the vows which  I laid upon you that day? Answer me!\"    \"Has the partner whom you bound me to kept hers inviolate? Answer me  that, Sir! None can better do so than you, Mr. How's--tey--ca'--you.\"    \"So, then, you confess your backslidings, and avow the profligacy of  your life. And this person here is, I suppose, the partner of your  iniquity--she whose beauty hath caused you to err! Stand up, both of  you, till I rebuke you, and show you what you are in the eyes of God  and man.\"    \"In the first place, stand you still there, till I tell you what you  are in the eyes of God and man. You are, Sir, a presumptuous,  self-conceited pedagogue, a stirrer up of strife and commotion in  church, in state, in families, and communities. You are one, Sir, whose  righteousness consists in splitting the doctrines of Calvin into  thousands of undistinguishable films, and in setting up a system of  justifying-grace against all breaches of all laws, moral or divine. In  short, Sir, you are a mildew--a canker-worm in the bosom of the  Reformed Church, generating a disease of which she will never be  purged, but by the shedding of blood. Go thou in peace, and do these  abominations no more; but humble thyself, lest a worse reproof come  upon thee.\"    Wringhim heard all this without flinching. He now and then twisted his  mouth in disdain, treasuring up, meantime, his vengeance against the  two aggressors; for he felt that he had them on the hip, and resolved  to pour out his vengeance and indignation upon them. Sorry am I that  the shackles of modern decorum restrain me from penning that famous  rebuke; fragments of which have been attributed to every divine of old  notoriety throughout Scotland. But I have it by heart; and a glorious  morsel it is to put into the hands of certain incendiaries. The  metaphors are so strong and so appalling that Miss Logan could only  stand them a very short time; she was obliged to withdraw in confusion.  The laird stood his ground with much ado, though his face was often  crimsoned over with the hues of shame and anger. Several times he was  on the point of turning the officious sycophant to the door; but good  manners, and an inherent respect that lie entertained for the clergy,  as the immediate servants of the Supreme Being, restrained him.    Wringhim, perceiving these symptoms of resentment, took them for marks  of shame and contrition, and pushed his reproaches farther than ever  divine ventured to do in a similar case. When he had finished, to  prevent further discussion, he walked slowly and majestically out of  the apartment, making his robes to swing behind him in a most  magisterial manner; he being, without doubt, elated with his high  conquest. He went to the upper story, and related to his metaphysical  associate his wonderful success; how he had driven the dame from the  house in tears and deep confusion, and left the backsliding laird in  such a quandary of shame and repentance that he could neither  articulate a word nor lift up his countenance. The dame thanked him  most cordially, lauding his friendly zeal and powerful eloquence; and  then the two again set keenly to the splitting of hairs, and making  distinctions in religion where none existed.    They being both children of adoption, and secured from falling into  snares, or anyway under the power of the wicked one, it was their  custom, on each visit, to sit up a night in the same apartment, for the  sake of sweet spiritual converse; but that time, in the course of the  night, they differed so materially on a small point somewhere between  justification and final election that the minister, in the heat of his  zeal, sprung from his seat, paced the floor, and maintained his point  with such ardour that Martha was alarmed, and, thinking they were going  to fight, and that the minister would be a hard match for her mistress,  she put on some clothes, and twice left her bed and stood listening at  the back of the door, ready to burst in should need require it. Should  anyone think this picture over-strained, I can assure him that it is  taken from nature and from truth; but I will not likewise aver that the  theologist was neither crazed nor inebriated. If the listener's words  were to be relied on, there was no love, no accommodating principle  manifested between the two, but a fiery burning zeal, relating to  points of such minor importance that a true Christian would blush to  hear them mentioned, and the infidel and profane make a handle of them"]]]
