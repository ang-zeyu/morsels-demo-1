Marguerite, a daughter of this  ancient house, expiated, with her brother, their offences upon the  scaffold at Paris. Every effort was made to spare their lives; but the  King, or rather Queen Margot, was inexorable. The chateau of Tourlaville  is beautifully situated; it is in the style of the Renaissance, with an  angular tower, which recalls that of Heidelberg Castle. The ground-floor  consists of two large unfurnished rooms, and a staircase, with iron  railing, leads to the story above. In one room hangs the portrait of a  lady chateleine, in the costume of the period of Louis XIII., with the  chateau of Tourlaville in the distance. On her left are eight Cupids with  bandages over their eyes, one in advance of the others is not blinded.  From the lady's mouth is a label, with the inscription \"Un (seul) me  suffit.\" This is said to be the portrait of the Lady Marguerite, but the  costume is of a later date. In one of the rooms is a chimney-piece covered  with a variety of amatory devices and mottoes:--a Cupid blinded, holding a  lighted torch, motto \"Ce qui me donne la vie me cause la mort.\" Again,  another Cupid with eyes bandaged, pouring water out of a vase to cool a  flaming heart he holds in his hand, motto \"Sa froideur me glace les veines  et son ardeur brule mon coeur.\" Six winged hearts flying at the approach of  Cupid, but which are reached by his darts, \"Meme en fuyant l'on est pris.\"  Further is a sentiment in verse:--          \"Plusieurs sont atteints de ce feu,      Mais il ne s'en guerit que fort peu.\"      Again,--          \"Ces deux n'en font qu'un.\"      [Illustration: 3. Chateau of Tourlaville.]    A river in the foreground, in the distance a setting sun, motto \"Ainsi  puissai-je mourir.\" This assemblage of devices and mottoes is not  applicable to any particular individual, but may be supposed to be merely  an expression of the taste of the time. They are of the seventeenth  century, when the Ravalet had been succeeded by the Franquetot family, who  have since taken the name of Coigny. Their arms, with several others, are  in the little boudoir in one of the towers, called the Blue Chamber. Its  walls are distempered blue, and the coverlet and hangings of the bed, with  all the decorations of the room, are of the same colour. Having admired  the lovely view from the \"Tour des quatre vents,\" we descended to the  kitchen of the farmer who rents the house, which now belongs to the  Tocqueville family. His wife was busily employed in making \"crepes,\" a  favourite kind of cake in Normandy and Brittany. It is made generally of  the flour of the sarrasin or buckwheat, mixed with milk or water, and  spread into a kind of pancake, which is fried on an iron pan, resembling  the Scotch griddle-cakes. Another variety, called \"galette,\" is made of  the same ingredients, but differs from the crepe in its being made three  or four times the thickness, and is therefore not so light. Though  generally made of buckwheat, wheat or oat-flour is sometimes used; and in  the towns, sugar and cinnamon and vanilla are added, and the simple  character of the crepe entirely changed under the hands of the  confectioner. The little village of Tourlaville was famous for its  glassworks, until supplanted by those of Gobain.    On our return to Cherbourg we visited the lace school of the Soeurs de la  Providence, where about two hundred girls are employed in making black  lace like that of Bayeux, which has now completely superseded the  Chantilly; the manner of making both laces is similar. The old Chantilly  has completely died out, and the modern manufacture extends the whole  length of Normandy from Cherbourg to Bayeux. How the children can keep the  bobbins from entangling is a marvel; there were as many as five hundred on  one pillow. The lace-makers were chiefly employed in flounces, shawls, and  other large works. These are all made in separate pieces, and united by  the stitch called fine joining or \"raboutissage.\" A half-shawl or \"pointe\"  was divided into thirty segments. We passed the evening at the  Etablissement, and next morning left Cherbourg.    The railway traverses the picturesque and rocky valley of Quincampoix to  Martinvast, whose little Romanesque church stands close to the station,  and at a short distance is the chateau of Martinvast, where its late  proprietor, M. du Moncel, established a model farm. A monument has been  erected to his memory in the church by the commune of Martinvast.    [Illustration: 4. Castle of Bricquebec.]    At Sottevast we took the omnibus for Bricquebec, which lies nearly five  miles from the station. Its ruined castle, dating from the end of the  fourteenth century, with its lofty octagonal donjon, nearly a hundred feet  high, standing on a high \"motte\" or artificial mound, has a most imposing  appearance. Bricquebec, the most considerable demesne of the Cotentins,  was taken by King Henry V. from the Sire d'Estouteville, who had so  gallantly defended Mont St. Michel against him. Henry gave Bricquebec to  William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, the ill-fated favourite of Queen  Margaret of Anjou, and he, on being taken prisoner by the French, sold it,  to raise the money for his ransom, to Sir Bertie Entwistle, who fought at  Agincourt, and who held it till the battle of Formigny expelled the  English from Normandy, and Sir Bertie fell at St. Albans in the  Lancastrian cause. The inn, \"Hotel du Vieux Chateau,\" is within the  enclosure of the ruins--a most dilapidated old place; our dirty  ill-furnished room next to a hayloft, the horses passing through the house  to the stable, and every kind of litter and rubbish accumulated under the  windows. Yet in the room we occupied had once slept our gracious Sovereign  Queen Victoria. On a placard is inscribed, \"Chambre de la famille royale  d'Angleterre, 18 Aout 1857;\" and below stairs is another, setting forth,  \"S. M. la Reine d'Angleterre, le Prince Albert, les Princesses Royale et  Alice, le Prince Alfred, sont descendus a l'hotel du Vieux Chateau le 10  Aout 1857.\" About a mile from Bricquebec is a Trappist convent; but we  were not allowed admission beyond the parlour, where is sold a quantity of  cutlery, not made--as we were given to understand when offered for sale--by  the monks.    Regaining the railroad, we went on to Valognes, which has been styled the  St. Germain of Normandy; a dull town, with worn-out houses, occupied by  worn-out aristocratic families. The grass grows in the streets.    Here we left the rail and proceeded to Saint Sauveur-le-Vicomte. On  entering the town, the castle is on the right of the road, the Abbey  church on the left. The large demesne of Saint Sauveur-le-Vicomte passed  by marriage into the Harcourt family, and belonged, in the time of Edward  III., to Geoffrey d'Harcourt, whose fortress was one of the most  formidable in Normandy. Banished from France, he went over to England and  persuaded Edward III. to make a descent upon Normandy instead of Gascony,  assuring him he would find rich towns and fair castles without any means  of defence, and that his people would gain wealth enough to suffice them  for twenty years to come. The King landed at La Hogue, or Saint  Vaast-la-Hogue, as it is now called, where he knighted the Prince of Wales  and made Warwick and Harcourt marshals of his army. They advanced in three  divisions--the King and the Prince in the centre, the two marshals on the  right and left--ravaging all before them, and not stopping in their  victorious course till the great victory at Crecy. Harcourt subsequently  met a traitor's fate. A force was sent against him, his army was routed,  and, preferring death to being taken, he fought most valiantly until he  was struck to the ground by French lances, when some men-at-arms  dispatched him with their swords. He had sold the reversion of his castle  to King Edward III., to whom it was confirmed by the treaty of Bretigny.  Edward bestowed the barony upon that pride of English chivalry, Sir John  Chandos, in recompense for his great services in the wars. The square  donjon and inner gate were built by Chandos. The castle is well preserved,  and is now used as a hospice for orphans and aged women. The rooms are  kept beautifully clean, and on a tablet in one of the corridors is written  up \"Dortoirs restaures par la munificence de M. le Comte Georges  d'Harcourt en memoire de ses illustres ayeux, anciens Seigneurs de ce  chateau, en 1838.\"    The Benedictine convent also belonged to the Harcourts until the revolt of  Geoffrey. It is now the property of the Soeurs de la Misericorde, who have  rebuilt the fine Abbey church according to its former model. Originally  built in the eleventh century, it was partly burnt in the fourteenth, and  reconstructed in the fifteenth. The columns and arches of the nave are of  the first period; the form of the church is a Latin cross, having an apse  ornamented with a double row of lancet windows, richly sculptured. The  sculptures are all executed by an untaught workman of the place, who died  before he had completed the pulpit. To collect the funds necessary for the  undertaking, the foundress travelled throughout Europe. Her tomb is in the  church. \"Julie Francoise Catherine Postel, nee a Barfleur, 1756. Soeur  Marie Madelaine, Fondatrice et premiere Superieure Generale de l'Institut  des Ecoles Chretiennes de la Misericorde, morte en odeur de Saintete 16  Juillet 1846, a l'Abbaye de St. Sauveur-le-Vicomte.\" The badge of the  sisterhood is a cross inscribed with their motto \"L'obeissance jusqu'a la  mort.\" Some of the party made an attempt at fishing in the little river  Douve, but without success, though rewarded for their walk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#3)"],[1,"in the newspaper that a certain  book had been sold for a large sum because of a misprint in it. This set  him wondering . . . 'at the Peacock _without_ Temple-Bar . . .'  Temple-Bar without a peacock he could imagine: surely this was a  misprint! Perhaps the book was valuable, and others had not 'spotted' the  error!    And now he bethought him of an acquaintance who kept a bookshop in the  West End of the town, a man who knew a lot about old books. He would take  it to him and ask his advice. So, one Saturday afternoon he carried his  'treasure' to the shop in question. Inside, an elderly man was examining  a calf-bound volume.    '. . . the first authentic edition, seventeen hundred and nine,' he was  saying.    The young man glanced at the volume under discussion, and as a page was  turned he caught sight of the heading 'Hans Carvel.' Good gracious; this  volume was the same as his! Just then the elderly man looked up, and the  young fellow handed his volume to the bookseller, saying: 'Here's another  one, same as that, but mine's got something wrong on the front page.'    The bookseller opened the newcomer's volume, looked at the title-page,  and handed it without a word to his customer, who took it with a look of  surprise.    'Something wrong?' said he, 'why, bless me, what's this--1707--that  rascal Curll's edition--where did you get this?'    The young man told him, adding that he gave sixpence for it.    'Sixpence, did you?' said the connoisseur; 'well, I'll give you six  guineas for it': which he did, there and then.    It was a copy of the rare 'pirated' collection of his poems, published  without Matt Prior's knowledge, some two years before the first authentic  edition appeared. Some years later, when the elderly collector died, this  volume came to the saleroom with the rest of his books. It realised forty  pounds! So much for the ugly duckling.    What an absorbing topic is that of 'lost books'! There is a fascination  about the subject that every bibliophile must have experienced. 'Hope  springs eternal in the human breast,' and it is impossible to read of  books long lost without making a mental note of their titles in the hope  that some day we may come across them. Perhaps it is these memories,  pigeon-holed in our mind, that add a zest to anticipation whenever we go  book-hunting on our travels. But alas! the reward for the bibliophile's  hope in this direction is rare as the blossoming of the aloe.    It is curious to think of the thousands of books that have completely  disappeared. Nowadays the Act which assures the preservation in our  greater libraries of every book published in this country will doubtless  prevent the disappearance of a good many English books of lesser  importance, such as school books and other works that are quickly  superseded. But before the passing of this Act there was nothing to  prevent an unpopular or useless work from becoming extinct, and vast  numbers must have disappeared in this country alone. There are many  books, however, important books even, and books which we know to have  been immensely popular in their day, of which so much as a glimpse has  been denied us. The 1606 octavo of 'The Passionate Pilgrim,' the first  issue of John Barclay's satirical romance 'Euphormionis Lusinini  Satyricon,' published at London in 1603, the 'Famous Historie of the  Vertuous and Godly Woman Judith,' London, 1565 (of which a title-page has  been preserved), what would not every book-collector give for copies of  these?    Then there are such early-printed works as Caxton's translation of the  Metamorphoses of Ovid, probably published by him about 1480, 'The Life of  St. Margaret' (known by three leaves preserved in the Bodleian), the  'goste of guido' or Ghost of Guy, and the Epitaph of the King of  Scotland, all printed by Pynson, as well as that mysterious volume  ycleped 'The Nigramansir,' said to be by John Skelton the poet-laureate  who lived under five kings and died in 1529. Many of Skelton's works,  perhaps even the majority of his writings, are known to us by title and  hearsay alone; but who shall say that his 'Speculum Principis,' or 'the  Commedy Achademios callyd by name,' which he himself mentions, are lost  beyond all hope of recovery? 'The Nigramansir' was actually seen by  Thomas Warton, the poet-laureate, in the 'fifties of the eighteenth  century, and is described by him in some detail. His account is so  interesting that it deserves quoting.    'I cannot quit Skelton,' he writes, 'without restoring to the public  notice a play, or MORALITY, written by him, not recited in any catalogue  of his works, or annals of English typography; and, I believe, at present  totally unknown to the antiquarians in this sort of literature. It is,  _The_ NIGRAMANSIR, _a morall_ ENTERLUDE _and a pithie written by Maister_  SKELTON _laureate and plaid before the king and other estatys at  Woodstock on Palme Sunday._ It was printed by Wynkin de Worde in a thin  quarto, in the year 1504.'    Against this Warton makes the following note: 'My lamented friend Mr.  William Collins . . . . shewed me this piece at Chichester, not many  months before his death (Collins died in 1759), and he pointed it out as  a very rare and valuable curiosity. He intended to write the History of  the Restoration of Learning under Leo the Tenth, and with a view to that  design had collected many scarce books. Some few of these fell into my  hands at his death. The rest, among which, I suppose, was this Interlude,  were dispersed.'    Warton then goes on to describe the book in detail, and this  circumstance, together with the fact that he quotes one of the stage  directions ('_enter Balsebub with a Berde_') seems to point to the fact  that he actually had the volume in his hands. It concerned the trial of  Simony and Avarice, with the Devil as Judge. 'The characters are a  Necromancer or Conjurer, the Devil, a Notary Public, Simonie, and  Philargyria or Avarice. . . . There is no sort of propriety in calling  this play the Necromancer: for the only business and use of this  character is to open the subject in a long prologue.'[3] Unfortunately  there is no other mention of this interesting work, and of recent years  its very existence has been doubted.    'It was at Chichester,' wrote Hazlitt, 'that the poet Collins brought  together a certain number of early books, some of the first rarity; his  name is found, too, in the sale catalogues of the last century as a buyer  of such; and the strange and regrettable fact is that two or three items  which Thomas Warton actually saw in his hands, and of which there are no  known duplicates, have not so far been recovered.' Mr. Gordon Duff, in  his 'English Provincial Printers,' mentions seventeen books described by  Herbert at the end of the eighteenth century, of which no copies are now  known to exist. Another rare volume is known to have existed about the  same time. A copy, the only one known, of 'The Fabulous Tales of Esope  the Phrygian' by Robert Henryson, published at London in 1577, was  formerly in the library of Syon College; for it is included in Reading's  catalogue of that college library, compiled in 1724. But its whereabouts  is now unknown. Fortunately in this case a later edition has survived.    Another mysterious volume is the treatise concerning Elizabeth Barton,  the Maid of Kent, who was burnt at Tyburn in 1534. Cranmer, describing  her story to a friend, writes: 'and a boke (was) written of all the hole  storie thereof, and putt into prynte, which euer syns that tyme hath byn  comonly sold and goone abrod amongs all people.' From the confession of  John Skot, the printer of this work, at the trial, it seems that seven  hundred copies were printed; but no copy is now known to exist.    Other works there are as yet unseen by bibliographer, such as Markham's  'Thyrsis and Daphne,' a poem printed in 1593, and the 1609 and 1612  quartos of Ben Jonson's 'Epicoene or the Silent Woman.' This last was  seen by William Gifford a century ago, but neither is now known to exist.  Or is a copy extant of Horace's 'Art of Poetry' english'd by Jonson and  published so late as 1640. Alas! the list of works by 'rare Ben Jonson'  now lost to us, it is feared, for ever, is quite a lengthy one. Who has  seen the original issue of 'Gude and Godlie Ballatis,' printed at  Edinburgh in 1546? Of this book it has been said that, after the Bible,  it did more for the spread of Reformation doctrines in Scotland than any  other volume; so presumably a fairly large edition was printed.    That the editions of some of these early-printed books, now with us no  more, were of considerable size may be judged from contemporary evidence  of their widespread popularity. Speaking of the 'Morte d'Arthur,' Mr. E.  G. Duff remarks: 'Of the popularity of the book we have striking  evidence. Of Caxton's edition two copies are known, of which one is  imperfect.[4] The second edition, printed by Wynkin de Worde in 1498, is  known from one copy only, which is imperfect; while the third edition,  also printed by de Worde is, again, only known from one imperfect copy.  It may well be, considering these facts, that there were other  intervening editions which have entirely disappeared.'    Of the thirteen early editions of Shakespeare's 'Venus and Adonis' only  twenty-two copies have so far been traced. Yet if each of these editions  comprised only 250 copies, the tale of survivors is not large out of a  total of 3,250. 'Printers and publishers . . . strained their resources  to satisfy the demands of eager purchasers,' remarks Sir Sidney Lee; so  presumably the estimate of 250 per edition is a conservative one.    Where are these volumes now? It is difficult to believe they have been  utterly destroyed, leaf by leaf, so that no vestige of them any longer  exists. Surely they will turn up at an auction sale some day, for they  may well be safely ensconced, at this very"]]]
