DISEASES OF IRRITATION.    ORDO I.    _Increased Irritation._    GENUS I.    _With increased Actions of the Sanguiferous System._    The irritability of the whole, or of part, of our system is perpetually  changing; these vicissitudes of irritability and of inirritability are  believed to depend on the accumulation or exhaustion of the sensorial  power, as their proximate cause; and on the difference of the present  stimulus, and of that which we had previously been accustomed to, as their  remote cause. Thus a smaller degree of heat produces pain and inflammation  in our hands, after they have been for a time immersed in snow; which is  owing to the accumulation of sensorial power in the moving fibres of the  cutaneous vessels during their previous quiescence, when they were benumbed  with cold. And we feel ourselves cold in the usual temperature of the  atmosphere on coming out of a warm room; which is owing to the exhaustion  of sensorial power in the moving fibres of the vessels of the skin by their  previous increased activity, into which they were excited by unusual heat.    Hence the cold fits of fever are the occasion of the succeeding hot ones;  and the hot fits contribute to occasion in their turn the succeeding cold  ones. And though the increase of stimulus, as of heat, exercise, or  distention, will produce an increased action of the stimulated fibres; in  the same manner as it is produced by the increased irritability which was  occasioned by a previous defect of stimulus; yet as the excesses of  irritation from the stimulus of external things are more easily avoided  than the deficiencies of it; the diseases of this country, except those  which are the consequences of drunkenness, or of immoderate exercise, more  frequently begin with torpor than with orgasm; that is, with inactivity of  some parts, or of the whole of the system, and consequent coldness, than  with increased activity, and consequent heat.    If the hot fit be the consequence of the cold one, it may be asked if they  are proportionate to each other: it is probable that they are, where no  part is destroyed by the cold fit, as in mortification or death. But we  have no measure to distinguish this, except the time of their duration;  whereas the extent of the torpor over a greater or less part of the system,  which occasions the cold fit; or of the exertion which occasions the hot  one; as well as the degree of such torpor or exertion, are perhaps more  material than the time of their duration. Besides this some muscles are  less liable to accumulate sensorial power during their torpor, than others,  as the locomotive muscles compared with the capillary arteries; on all  which accounts a long cold fit may often be followed by a short hot one.    SPECIES.    1. _Febris irritativa._ Irritative fever. This is the synocha of some  writers, it is attended with strong pulse without inflammation; and in this  circumstance differs from the febris inirritativa of Class I. 2. 1. 1.  which is attended with weak pulse without inflammation. The increased  frequency of the pulsation of the heart and arteries constitutes fever;  during the cold fit these pulsations are always weak, as the energy of  action is then decreased throughout the whole system; and therefore the  general arterial strength cannot be determined by the touch, till the cold  part of the paroxysm ceases. This determination is sometimes attended with  difficulty; as strong and weak are only comparative degrees of the greater  or less resistance of the pulsation of the artery to the compression of the  finger. But the greater or less frequency of the pulsations affords a  collateral evidence in those cases, where the degree of strength is not  very distinguishable, which may assist our judgment concerning it. Since a  moderately strong pulse, when the patient is in a recumbent posture, and  not hurried in mind, seldom exceeds 120 strokes in a minute; whereas a weak  one often exceeds 130 in a recumbent posture, and 150 in an erect one, in  those fevers, which are termed nervous or putrid. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.    The increased frequency of the pulsation of the heart and arteries, as it  is occasioned either by excess or defect of stimulus, or of sensorial  power, exists both in the cold and hot fits of fever; but when the cold fit  ceases, and the pulse becomes strong and full as well as quick, in  consequence of the increased"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27609"],[0,"The Undersea Tube (#3)"],[1,"the wall had blown out into a  gigantic cavern, and with it the rest of the cars had rolled down the  bluff a tangled, twisted mass of steel. My car had almost passed by, and  now it still stuck in the tube, even though the last port-hole through  which I peered seemed to be suspended in air. But it was not the wrecked  cars from which rose such wails of despair and agony that held my  attention, but the cavern itself. For it was not really a cave, but a  vast underground city whose wide, marble streets stretched away to an  inferno of flame and lava. By the terrible light was lit up a great  white palace with its gold-tipped scrolls, and closer to me, the golden  temple of the Sun, with its tiers of lustrous yellow stairs--stairs worn  by the feet of many generations.    Above the stairs towered the great statue of a man on horseback. He was  dressed in a sort of tunic, and in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll  as if for the people to read. His face was turned toward me, and I  marveled even in that wild moment that the unknown sculptor could have  caught such an expression of appeal. I can see the high intellectual  brow as if it were before me at this moment--the level, sympathetic eyes  and the firm chin.           *       *       *       *       *    Then something moving caught my eyes, and I swear I saw a child--a  living child coming from the burning city--running madly, breathlessly  from a wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at any moment.  In spite of all the ridicule that has been showered upon me, I still  declare that the child did not come from the wreckage and that he wore a  tunic similar to the one of the statue and not the torn bit of a  nightgown or sheet.    He was some distance from me, but I could plainly see his expression of  wild distraction as he began to climb those gleaming stairs. Strangely  lustrous in the weird light, was that worn stairway of gold--gold, the  ancient metal of the Sun. With the slowness of one about to faint he  dragged himself up, while his breath seemed to be torn from his throat  in agonizing gasps. Behind him, the glowing liquid splashed against the  steps and the yellow metal of the Sun began to drip into its fiery  cauldron.    The child reached the leg of the horse and clung there.    ... Then suddenly the whole scene began to shake as if I had been  looking at a mirage, while just behind my car I had a flashing glimpse  in that lurid light of an emerald-green deluge bursting in like a dark  sky of solid water, and in that split-second before a crushing blow upon  my back, even through that tangle of bedclothes, knocked me into  unconsciousness, I seemed to hear again the hopeless note in the voice  of my friend as he said:    \"--an earthquake fault.\"    After what seemed to me aeons of strange, buzzing noises and peculiar  lights, I at last made out the objects around me as those of a hospital.  Men with serious faces were watching me. I have since been told that I  babbled incoherently about \"saving the little fellow\" and other equally  incomprehensible murmurings. From them I learned that the train the  other way was washed out, a tangled mass of wreckage just like my car,  both terminus stations wrecked utterly, and no one found alive except  myself. So, although I am to be a hopeless cripple, yet I am not sorry  that the skill and untiring patience of the great English surgeon, Dr.  Thompson, managed to nurse back the feeble spark of my life through all  those weeks that I hung on the borderland; for if he had not, the world  never would have known.    As it is, I wonder over the events of that night as if it had not been  an experience at all--but a wild weird dream. Even the gentleman with  the mass of silver hair is a mystery, for he was never identified, and  yet in my mind's recesses I can still hear his cultured voice asking  about the extra berth, and mentioning his pressing mission to Paris. And  somehow, he gives the last touch of strangeness to the events of that  fatal night, and in my mind, he becomes a part of it no less than the  child on the stairs, the burning inferno that lit the background, and  the great statue of that unknown hero who held out his scroll for a  moment in that lurid light, like a symbol from the sunken City of the  Dead.
