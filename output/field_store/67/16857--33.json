[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#3)"],[1,"up there. The cold became  intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers  were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,  round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their  hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug  being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned  to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and  berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy  as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:  a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that  such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord  Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his  fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household  should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on  the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,  stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and  the baby sallied out to buy the beef.    Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good  St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such  weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he  would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,  gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,  stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;  but, at the first sound of      'God bless you, merry gentleman,    May nothing you dismay!'    Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled  in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial  frost.    At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an  ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the  fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his  candle out, and put on his hat.    'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?' said Scrooge.    'If quite convenient, sir.'    'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. If I was to  stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?'    The clerk smiled faintly.    'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a  day's wages for no work.'    [Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end  of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas  Eve_]    The clerk observed that it was only once a year.    'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of  December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I  suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next  morning.'    The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.  The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends  of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no  greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,  twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to  Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff.    Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and  having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening  with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had  once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of  rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little  business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run  there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other  houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and  dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms  being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,  who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and  frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed  as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the  threshold.    Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the  knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact  that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence  in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy  about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a  bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne  in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his  last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then  let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,  having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its  undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but  Marley's face.    Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects  in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in  a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as  Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly  forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;  and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.  That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to  be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of  its own expression.    As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.    To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of  a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would  be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned  it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.    He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;  and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to  be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the  hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws  and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!' and closed  it with a bang.    The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,  and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a  separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be  frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,  and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.    You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight  of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say  you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,  with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the  balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and  room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a  locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen  gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so  you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.    Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and  Scrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through  his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of  the face to desire to do that.    Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under  the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and  basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his  head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody  in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude  against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two  fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.    [Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in  his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against  the wall_]    Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double  locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against  surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,  and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.    It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was  obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract  the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace  was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all  round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.  There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,  Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like  feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in  butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that  face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,  and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at  first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the  disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of  old Marley's head on every one.    'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.    After several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the  chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that  hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with  a chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great  astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he  looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the  outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],[0,"The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#3)"],[1," was unaccustomed as yet to schoolgirl banter, and could  not abstain from replying:    \"Does it matter whether we do or not?\"    She spoke quietly, but there was a gleam in her eye, as if her temper  were rising.    \"Not in the least! I only thought all Irish people cultivated pigs.\"    \"It's no worse than keeping a cat, or a dog.\"    \"My dear Paddy, of course not! Still, I shouldn't care to have the  creatures in the drawing-room. Take a little more bread and butter. I'm  sorry we've no potatoes to offer you.\"    The Hammond-Smiths and the Lawsons tittered, and Dorothy Arkwright was  about to state her frank opinion of their behaviour when Honor's  pent-up wrath exploded.    \"We don't keep pigs in the drawing-room,\" she exclaimed. \"There's a  saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man, so if your name is  Taylor you can only be the ninth part of a lady!\" Then, realizing that  her upraised voice had drawn upon her the attention, not only of all  the girls, but also of Miss Maitland, she flushed crimson, scraped back  her chair, and fled precipitately from the room.    Miss Maitland looked surprised. It was an unheard-of thing for any girl  to leave the tea-table without permission. Such a breach of school  decorum had surely never been committed before at St. Chad's! There was  a very complete code of etiquette observed at the house, and to break  one of the laws of politeness was considered an unpardonable offence.    \"She's made a bad beginning,\" whispered Ruth Latimer to Maisie Talbot.  \"It's most unfortunate. It was really the fault of Flossie Taylor and  the Hammond-Smiths. They needn't have teased her so.\"    \"Still, it was silly of her to lose her temper,\" replied Maisie. \"She  stalked out of the room like a queen of tragedy. Miss Maitland can't  bear girls who give way to their impulses; she despises what she calls  'early Victorian hysterics', and I quite agree with her.\"    \"Yes, we must learn to be stoics here,\" said Ruth; \"and as for teasing,  the wisest thing is to take no notice of it.\"    A monitress had been dispatched to fetch Honor back, but in a short  time she returned alone, and reported that she could not find her. Miss  Maitland made no comment, and as the meal was now over she gave the  signal of dismissal. Most of the girls went to the recreation room, but  Maisie Talbot, who had not yet quite concluded her unpacking, ran  straight upstairs. Noticing something move behind a curtain in the  corner of the bedroom, she pulled it aside. There was Honor, sitting in  a queer little heap on the floor, and rubbing her eyes in a very  suggestive manner. She jumped up in a moment, however, and pretended  that she was only arranging her boots.    \"I'd finished tea,\" she remarked airily, \"so I thought I might as well  empty my box, and put my dresses away in my wardrobe.\"    \"You'll have to ask Miss Maitland's leave next time, before you march  out of the room, or you'll get into trouble,\" said Maisie. \"If it  weren't your first evening, you'd be expected to make a public apology.  Of course, Flossie Taylor and the Hammond-Smiths were aggravating, but  you should just have laughed at them, and then they'd have stopped. We  don't behave like kindergarten children here.\"    Maisie spoke scathingly. She was a girl who had scant sympathy with  what she called \"babyishness\", and disliked any exhibition of feeling.  And, after all, she only voiced the general opinion of the school,  which, by an unwritten law, had established a calm imperturbation as  the height of good breeding.    \"I don't care in the least what any of you think!\" retorted Honor, and  she hung up her skirt with such a jerk that she broke the loop.    Yet, although she spoke lightly, she evidently did care. She was very  quiet indeed all the rest of the evening, and hardly spoke at  recreation. Chatty Burns sat down next to her and tried to begin a  conversation, but Honor answered so briefly that she very soon gave up  the effort in despair, and moved away; while the other girls were so  interested in their own affairs that they did not trouble to remember  their new schoolfellow. At nine o'clock prayers were read, and  everybody went upstairs to bed.    When the lights were out, and the room was in perfect silence, a  strange, suppressed noise issued from Honor's corner. It might, of  course, have been snoring; and Honor explained elaborately next morning  that Irish people often have a peculiar way of breathing in their  sleep--an affection from which she sometimes suffered herself.    \"All the same, I don't quite believe her,\" confided Pauline Reynolds,  who occupied the next cubicle, to Lettice Talbot, a more sympathetic  character than her sister Maisie. \"I know what it is to feel home-sick,  and to smother one's nose in the pillow! If that wasn't sobbing, it was  as like it as anything I've ever heard in my life.\"          CHAPTER II    Honor's Home      For a full understanding of Honor Fitzgerald we must go back a few  weeks, and see her in that Irish home which was so far away and so  utterly different from Chessington College. Kilmore Castle was a great,  rambling, old-fashioned country house, built beside an inland creek of  the sea, and sheltered by a range of hills from the wild winds of  Kerry. To Honor that was the dearest and most beautiful spot in the  world. She loved every inch of it--the silvery strips of water that led  between bold, rocky headlands out to the broad Atlantic; the tall  mountain peaks that showed so rugged an outline against the sky; the  brown, peat-stained river that came brawling down from the uplands, and  poured itself noisily into the creek; the wide, lonely moors, with  their stretches of brilliant green grass and dark, treacherous bog  pools; and the craggy cliffs that made a barrier against the  ever-dashing waves, and round which thousands of sea birds flew, with  harsh cries and whir of white wings.    Its situation at the end of a long peninsula made Kilmore Castle an  isolated little kingdom of its own. On the shore stood a row of low,  fishermen's white-washed cabins, dignified by the name of \"the  village\"; but otherwise there was no human habitation in sight, and  Ballycroghan, the market town and nearest postal, railway, and  telegraph station, was ten miles off.    Trees were rarities at Kilmore; a few stunted specimens, all blown one  way by the prevailing gale, grew as if huddled together for protection  at the foot of the glen, but they were the exception that proved the  rule; nevertheless, under the sheltering walls of the Castle Mrs.  Fitzgerald had managed to acclimatize some exotic shrubs, and to  cultivate quite a beautiful garden of flowers, for the temperature was  uniformly mild, though the winds were boisterous. Brilliant St.  Brigid's anemones, the poet's narcissus, tulips, jonquils, and  hyacinths bloomed here almost as early as in the Scilly Isles, and made  patches of fragrant brightness under the sitting-room windows; while in  the crannies of the walls might be seen delicate maidenhair and other  ferns, too tender generally to stand a winter in the open.    Born and bred in this far-away corner of the world, Honor had grown up  almost a child of nature. Her whole life had been spent as much as  possible out-of-doors, boating, fishing, or swimming in the creek;  driving in a low-backed car over the rough Kerry roads; galloping her  shaggy little pony on the moors; following the otter hounds up the  river, and sharing in any sport that her father considered suitable for  her age and sex. She was the only girl among five brothers, and in her  mother's opinion was by far the most difficult to manage of the whole  flock. All the wild Irish blood of the family seemed to have settled in  her; the high spirits, the fire, the pride, the quick temper, the  impatience of control, the happy-go-lucky, idle, irresponsible ways of  a long line of hot-headed ancestors had skipped a generation or two,  and, as if they had been bottling themselves up during the interval,  had reappeared with renewed force in this particular specimen of the  Fitzgerald race.    \"She's more trouble than the five boys put together,\" her mother often  declared, and her friends cordially agreed with her. Mrs. Fitzgerald  herself was a mild, quiet, nervous, delicate lady, as much astonished  at her lively, tempestuous daughter as a meek little hedge-sparrow  would be, that had hatched a young cuckoo. Frankly, she did not  understand Honor, whose strong, uncontrolled character differed so  entirely from her own gentle, clinging, dependent disposition; and  whose storms of grief or anger, wild fits of waywardness and equally  passionate repentance, and self-willed disobedience, alternating with  sudden bursts of reformation, were a constant source of worry and  anxiety, and the direct opposite of her ideal of girlhood. Poor Mrs.  Fitzgerald would have liked a docile, tractable daughter, who would  have been content to sit beside her sofa doing fancy work, instead of  riding to hounds; and who would have had more consideration for her  weak state of health. She appreciated Honor's warm-hearted affection to  the full, but at the same time wished she could make her realize that  rough hugs, boisterous kisses, and loud tones were hardly suitable to  an invalid. Suffering as she was from a painful and incurable  complaint, it was sometimes impossible for her to admit Honor to her  sick-room, and for weeks together the girl would hardly see her mother.  It was through no lack of love that Honor had failed to give that  service and tenderness which, in the circumstances, an only daughter  might so fitly have rendered; it was from sheer want of thought, and  general heedlessness. Some girls early acquire a sense of  responsibility and care for others, but in Honor these qualities were  as undeveloped as in a child of six.    Many were the governesses who had attempted to tame the young rebel,  and bring"]]]
