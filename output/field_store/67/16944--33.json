MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE PHILIPPINES      DICOTYLEDONOUS, POLYPETALOUS.          DILLENIACEÆ.        _Tetracera macrophylla, Vall._ (_T. monocarpa_, _T. sarmentosa_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Malakatmón_, Tag.    Uses.--The wood of _malakatmón_ is one of the best known and popular  drugs of the Binondo [1] market place. It is used as an infusion  internally in the hæmoptysis of consumptives, and externally in the  treatment of sore throat, its action being due to the large amount  of tannin it contains. It is also employed in Malabar in the form of  an infusion of the leaves of the species, _T. Rheedi_, to treat sore  throat, mixing it with a decoction of rice called _cange_.    The Filipinos do not distinguish this species from the _T. Assa_.    Both are called _malakatmón_, and are employed indiscriminately to  accomplish the same results. The silicious concretion obtained from  the leaves is used as a polish in the form of polish paper.    Dose.--In infusion for internal use, 4 grams of wood to 1 liter of  water; as a gargle, 10 to 15 grams to the liter.    Botanical Description.--A shrub with leaves alternate, oval, serrate,  finely dentate with very short and stiff hairs. Flowers of a strong,  rather agreeable odor, axillary, in panicles. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,  4 petals. Stamens indefinite, expanding at the upper end and bearing  2 anthers. Carpels 3, with ovules indefinite in two series. Seeds  with red arils.    Habitat.--In the vicinity of Manila. Blooms in July.          MAGNOLIACEÆ    Magnolia Family.        _Illicium anisatum, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Anis estrellado_, _Badiana_, Sp.; _Sangki_, Tag.; _Star  Anise_, Eng.    Uses.--Although this plant does not grow in the Philippines, the  use of its fruit is so common there that it demands a place in this  work. It is employed chiefly as a condiment in the preparation of food,  and its essential oil is used to prepare the native \"anise cordial\"  by mixing it with alcohol obtained from the palm or from sugar cane.    The decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tea-like beverage,  to aid digestion or for its carminative effect in flatulent colic.    Star anise has an aromatic taste, slightly bitter and acrid, and  a very marked perfume of anise which with its star-like form gives  the plant one of its names. It is a very useful stimulant, tonic,  stomachic and carminative.    It is official in all Pharmacopoeias and the pericarp is the part  employed.    The dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion, to be  taken in one draught.    According to Schlegel it contains the following substances: An  essential oil 4.675; a green waxy material which melts at 51°, a resin,  a gum and saponin. The essential oil is (almost) identical with that  of anise from which it is impossible to distinguish it chemically. The  only difference is that the former has a blander odor and solidifies  at 1°.25 instead of 10°, as does the oil of anise.    Botanical Description.--The plant grows in the mountains of Yunnan,  China, and in Tonquin. The part used in the Philippines is the fruit,  being indeed the only part known here. This is composed of 8 woody  follicles arranged about a central column in the form of a star. These  follicles open at maturity and reveal the seeds, which are shining,  smooth, ovoid, hard, of a pretty chestnut-red color. In the Philippines  they are sold even in the smallest food-vending shops.        _Michelia Champaca, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Tsampaka_, _Sampaka_, Tag.; _Champaca_, Fil.-Span.    Uses.--The bark of the trunk is well known as a febrifuge  and emmenagogue in India. It is slightly bitter and  aromatic. Dr. H. Folliat has used it with success in the Island  of Mauritius in the treatment of the common intermittent fevers;  he administered the infusion (bark 30 grams, water 600 cc.)--or the  decoction (bark 30 grams, water 1,200 cc.); boil till reduced to  600 cc.--giving a wine-glassful every hour just before and after  the paroxysm.    An astringent decoction made from the leaves is used as a gargle in  sore throat. The root is emmenagogue and the seeds are used in the  treatment of anal fissure.    Dr. Hooper has found the following substances in the bark of the  _Champana_: a volatile oil with a pine-like odor; a fixed oil,  insoluble in alcohol, melting at 15° and forming soap with soda;  a resin extremely bitter, acrid, brown in color; tannin; sugar;  a bitter principle, albuminoids, coloring matters, mucilage and starch.    Botanical Description.--A tree 15-18° high; leaves alternate, 6 × 2',  stipulate, simple. Flowers fragrant, saffron-colored, hermaphrodite,  solitary and axillary. The receptacle, conical at its base, becomes  narrow, lengthens and then enlarges, forming a column which is bare  at its narrow part. At its base is inserted the perianth composed of  6 overlapping leaflets arranged in two series. Stamens indefinite,  fixed in the base of the column of the receptacle on the superior  portion of which are inserted the ovaries which contain many ovules  arranged in two vertical series.    Habitat.--Common in all parts (of the islands).          ANONACEÆ.    Custard-Apple Family.        _Artabotrys odoratissimus_, R. Br. (_A. hamatus_, Bl.; _Uvaria  Sinensis_ and _Unona uncinata_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Ilang-ilang de China_, Sp.-Fil.; _Alang-ilang Son-son_,  Tag.    Uses.--A decoction of the leaves of this species is used to treat  cholera in some of the islands of the Malay group; in the island of  Java they use for the same purpose a decoction of the leaves of the  species _A. suaveolens_, Bl., which is commonly called _Susong Damulog_  in the Pampanga dialect. The active principles of these plants are so  powerful that one must beware of giving a large dose, as hemorrhages,  nervous phenomena and abortion may follow.    Botanical Description.--A tree 15-18° high with leaves alternate,  lanceolate, glabrous, and petioles very short. Flowers very sweet,  axillary, solitary. Petals 6, fleshy, concave at the base. Stamens  indefinite, closely packed, overlapping. Peduncle curved like a crook.    Habitat.--Cultivated in gardens.        _Anona squamosa_, L. (_A. tuberosa_, Rumph.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Ates_, Tag.; _Custard Apple_, Eng.    Uses.--The fruit of the mature ates is edible and is one of the most  delicious that grows in the Philippines; its white and delicately  perfumed pulp has a delicious flavor. The unripe fruit is exceedingly  astringent. The fermented juice of the ripe pulp is used in certain  parts of America to prepare a popular drink. The powdered seeds make  a useful parasiticide especially when used on the scalp, but it is  necessary to avoid getting any of the drug in the eyes on account of  its irritant effect.    Botanical Description.--Tree 8 or 9° high with leaves alternate,  oblong, the edges pubescent. Flowers greenish-yellow, axillary,  solitary; peduncle not curved. Petals 6, convergent. Stamens crowded,  indefinite. Fruit fleshy, covered with scales or rather rounded  tubercles; beneath is the white and fragment pulp, covering the  long-oval seeds.        _A. reticulate, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Anonas_, Sp.-Fil.    Uses.--The fruit of this species is neither as much prized nor as  abundant"]]]
