Curious, Watson,  very curious.  Now he is off once more!  AT--why he is repeating it for  the third time.  ATTENTA three times!  How often will he repeat it?  No, that seems to be the finish.  He has withdrawn from the window.  What do you make of it, Watson?\"    \"A cipher message, Holmes.\"    My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension.  \"And not a very  obscure cipher, Watson,\" said he.  \"Why, of course, it is Italian!  The  A means that it is addressed to a woman.  'Beware! Beware!  Beware!'  How's that, Watson?    \"I believe you have hit it.\"    \"Not a doubt of it.  It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to  make it more so.  But beware of what?  Wait a bit, he is coming to the  window once more.\"    Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the  small flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came  more rapidly than before--so rapid that it was hard to follow them.    \"PERICOLO--pericolo--eh, what's that, Watson?  'Danger,' isn't it?  Yes, by Jove, it's a danger signal.  There he goes again! PERI.  Halloa, what on earth--\"    The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had  disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty  building, with its tiers of shining casements.  That last warning cry  had been suddenly cut short.  How, and by whom?  The same thought  occurred on the instant to us both.  Holmes sprang up from where he  crouched by the window.    \"This is serious, Watson,\" he cried.  \"There is some devilry going  forward!  Why should such a message stop in such a way?  I should put  Scotland Yard in touch with this business--and yet, it is too pressing  for us to leave.\"    \"Shall I go for the police?\"    \"We must define the situation a little more clearly.  It may bear some  more innocent interpretation.  Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves  and see what we can make of it.\"          Two        As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building  which we had left.  There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could  see the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out  into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of  that interrupted message.  At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a  man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the  railing.  He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.    \"Holmes!\" he cried.    \"Why, Gregson!\" said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland  Yard detective.  \"Journeys end with lovers' meetings. What brings you  here?\"    \"The same reasons that bring you, I expect,\" said Gregson.  \"How you  got on to it I can't imagine.\"    \"Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle.  I've been  taking the signals.\"    \"Signals?\"    \"Yes, from that window.  They broke off in the middle.  We came over to  see the reason.  But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in  continuing this business.\"    \"Wait a bit!\" cried Gregson eagerly.  \"I'll do you this justice, Mr.  Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger for  having you on my side.  There's only the one exit to these flats, so we  have him safe.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes.  You must give us  best this time.\"  He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which  a cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler  which stood on the far side of the street. \"May I introduce you to Mr.  Sherlock Holmes?\" he said to the cabman.  \"This is Mr. Leverton, of  Pinkerton's American Agency.\"    \"The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?\" said Holmes.  \"Sir, I am  pleased to meet you.\"    The American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven,  hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. \"I am on the  trail of my life now, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.  \"If I can get Gorgiano--\"    \"What!  Gorgiano of the Red Circle?\"    \"Oh, he has a European fame, has he?  Well, we've learned all about him  in America.  We KNOW he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we  have nothing positive we can take him on.  I tracked him over from New  York, and I've been close to him for a week in London, waiting some  excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to  ground in that big tenement house, and there's only one door, so he  can't slip us.  There's three folk come out since he went in, but I'll  swear he wasn't one of them.\"    \"Mr. Holmes talks of signals,\" said Gregson.  \"I expect, as usual, he  knows a good deal that we don't.\"    In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared  to us.  The American struck his hands together with vexation.    \"He's on to us!\" he cried.    \"Why do you think so?\"    \"Well, it figures out that way, does it not?  Here he is, sending out  messages to an accomplice--there are several of his gang in London.  Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that  there was danger, he broke short off.  What could it mean except that  from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the  street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and  that he must act right away if he was to avoid it?  What do you  suggest, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"That we go up at once and see for ourselves.\"    \"But we have no warrant for his arrest.\"    \"He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,\" said  Gregson.  \"That is good enough for the moment.  When we have him by the  heels we can see if New York can't help us to keep him.  I'll take the  responsibility of arresting him now.\"    Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but  never in that of courage.  Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this  desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike  bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of  Scotland Yard.  The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but  Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers were the privilege  of the London force.    The door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing  ajar.  Gregson pushed it open.  Within all was absolute silence and  darkness.  I struck a match and lit the detective's lantern.  As I did  so, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of  surprise.  On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was  outlined a fresh track of blood.  The red steps pointed towards us and  led away from an inner room, the door of which was closed.  Gregson  flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him, while we  all peered eagerly over his shoulders.    In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of  an enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in  its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of  blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork.  His knees  were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of  his broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a  knife driven blade-deep into his body.  Giant as he was, the man must  have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow.  Beside  his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay  upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.    \"By George! it's Black Gorgiano himself!\" cried the American detective.  \"Someone has got ahead of us this time.\"    \"Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,\" said Gregson. \"Why,  whatever are you doing?\"    Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it  backward and forward across the window-panes.  Then he peered into the  darkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.    \"I rather think that will be helpful,\" said he.  He came over and stood  in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body.  \"You say that three people came out from the flat while you were  waiting downstairs,\" said he at last.  \"Did you observe them closely?\"    \"Yes, I did.\"    \"Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?\"    \"Yes; he was the last to pass me.\"    \"That is your man, I fancy.  I can give you his description, and we  have a very excellent outline of his footmark.  That should be enough  for you.\"    \"Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.\"    \"Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your  aid.\"    We all turned round at the words.  There, framed in the doorway, was a  tall and beautiful woman--the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury.  Slowly  she advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension,  her eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark  figure on the floor.    \"You have killed him!\" she muttered.  \"Oh, Dio mio, you have killed  him!\"  Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang  into the air with a cry of joy.  Round and round the room she danced,  her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a  thousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips.  It was  terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such  a sight.  Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning  stare.    \"But you!  You are police, are you not?  You have killed Giuseppe  Gorgiano.  Is it not so?\"    \"We are police, madam.\"    She looked round into the shadows of the room.    \"But where, then, is Gennaro?\" she asked.  \"He is my husband, Gennaro  Lucca.  I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is  Gennaro?  He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all  my speed.\"    \"It was I who called,\" said Holmes.    \"You!  How could you call?\"    \"Your cipher was not difficult, madam.  Your presence here was  desirable. I knew that I had only to flash 'Vieni' and you would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2346"],[0,"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans (#3)"],[1,"train, and that train, so far as we can trace it,  must have passed about midnight on Monday.\"    \"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\"    \"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\"    \"No record of a door being found open?\"    \"None.\"    \"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\" said Lestrade. \"A  passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about  11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body  striking the line, just before the train reached the station.  There  was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report  of it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\"    My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon  his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the  tunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On  these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,  alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils,  and concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.    \"Points,\" he muttered; \"the points.\"    \"What of it?  What do you mean?\"    \"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as  this?\"    \"No; they are very few.\"    \"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\"    \"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\"    \"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in  interest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any  indications of bleeding on the line.\"    \"There were hardly any.\"    \"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\"    \"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\"    \"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible  for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the  thud of a fall in the fog?\"    \"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and  the carriages redistributed.\"    \"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\" said Lestrade, \"that every carriage has  been carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\"    It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient  with less alert intelligences than his own.    \"Very likely,\" said he, turning away.  \"As it happens, it was not the  carriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can  here.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our  investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\"    At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he  handed to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:    See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.  Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a  complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be  in England, with full address.    Sherlock.    \"That should be helpful, Watson,\" he remarked as we took our seats in  the Woolwich train.  \"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for  having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable  case.\"    His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung  energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had  opened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging  ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it  with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it  runs upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the  morning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in  the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a  few hours before round the fog-girt room.    \"There is material here.  There is scope,\" said he.  \"I am dull indeed  not to have understood its possibilities.\"    \"Even now they are dark to me.\"    \"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead  us far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF  of a carriage.\"    \"On the roof!\"    \"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence  that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as  it comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object  upon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect  no object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a  very curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question  of the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body  had bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they  have a cumulative force.\"    \"And the ticket, too!\" I cried.    \"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would  explain it.  Everything fits together.\"    \"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling  the mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \"perhaps.\"  He relapsed into a  silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in  Woolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from  his pocket.    \"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\" said he.  \"I  think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\"    The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns  stretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting,  and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered  our ring.    \"Sir James, sir!\" said he with solemn face.  \"Sir James died this  morning.\"    \"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \"How did he die?\"    \"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel  Valentine?\"    \"Yes, we had best do so.\"    We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we  were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the  younger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks,  and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the  household.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.    \"It was this horrible scandal,\" said he.  \"My brother, Sir James, was a  man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair.  It broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his  department, and this was a crushing blow.\"    \"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would  have helped us to clear the matter up.\"    \"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to  all of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the  police.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But  all the rest was inconceivable.\"    \"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\"    \"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no  desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we  are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this  interview to an end.\"    \"This is indeed an unexpected development,\" said my friend when we had  regained the cab.  \"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the  poor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some  sign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question  to the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\"    A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the  bereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any  use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced  herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the  last to see him upon that fatal night.    \"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\" she said.  \"I have not shut an eye  since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what  the true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded,  chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand  off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is  absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\"    \"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\"    \"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\"    \"Was he in any want of money?\"    \"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a  few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\"    \"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely  frank with us.\"    The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She  coloured and hesitated.    \"Yes,\" she said at last, \"I had a feeling that there was something on  his mind.\"    \"For long?\"    \"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I  pressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that  it was concerned with his official life.  'It is too serious for me to  speak about, even to you,' said he.  I could get nothing more.\"    Holmes looked grave.    \"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.  We cannot say what it may lead to.\"    \"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me  that he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening  of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he  said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\"    My friend's face grew graver still.    \"Anything else?\"    \"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy  for a traitor to get the plans.\"    \"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\"    \"Yes, quite recently.\"    \"Now tell us of that last evening.\"    \"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was  useless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly  he darted away into the fog.\"    \"Without a word?\"    \"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned.  Then I walked home.  Next"]]]
