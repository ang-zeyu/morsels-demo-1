The cost of the food supplies, the  equipment, and the incidental expenses was not far short of a thousand  dollars--a mere fraction of the cost of previous expeditions, it is  true, but a matter of long scraping together for a missionary. Yet if  there had been unlimited funds at his disposal--and the financial aspect  of the affair is alluded to only that this may be said--it would have  been impossible to assemble a more desirable party.    Mention of two Indian boys of fourteen or fifteen, who were of great  help to us, must not be omitted. They were picked out from the elder  boys of the school at Nenana, all of whom were most eager to go, and  were good specimens of mission-bred native youths. \"Johnny\" was with the  expedition from start to finish, keeping the base camp while the rest of  the party was above; Esaias was with us as far as the base camp and then  went back to Nenana with one of the dog teams.    [Sidenote: Methods of Approach]    The resolution to attempt the ascent of Denali was reached a year and a  half before it was put into execution: so much time was necessary for  preparation. Almost any Alaskan enterprise that calls for supplies or  equipment from the outside must be entered upon at least a year in  advance. The plan followed had been adopted long before as the only wise  one: that the supplies to be used upon the ascent be carried by water as  near to the base of the mountain as could be reached and cached there in  the summer, and that the climbing party go in with the dog teams as near  the 1st March as practicable. Strangely enough, of all the expeditions  that have essayed this ascent, the first, that of Judge Wickersham in  1903, and the last, ten years later, are the only ones that have  approached their task in this natural and easy way. The others have all  burdened themselves with the great and unnecessary difficulties of the  southern slopes of the range.    [Illustration: Tatum, Esaias, Karstens, Johnny and Walter, at the  Clearwater Camp.]    It was proposed to use the mission launch _Pelican_, which has travelled  close to twenty thousand miles on the Yukon and its tributaries in the  six seasons she has been in commission, to transport the supplies up the  Kantishna and Bearpaw Rivers to the head of navigation of the latter,  when her cruise of 1912 was complete. But a serious mishap to the  launch, which it was impossible to repair in Alaska, brought her  activities for that season to a sudden end. So Mr. Karstens came down  from Fairbanks with his launch, and a poling boat loaded with food  staples, and, pushing the poling boat ahead, successfully ascended the  rivers and carefully cached the stuff some fifty miles from the base of  the mountain. It was done in a week or less.    [Sidenote: Equipment]    Unfortunately, the equipment and supplies ordered from the outside did  not arrive in time to go in with the bulk of the stuff. Although ordered  in February, they arrived at Tanana only late in September, just in time  to catch the last boat up to Nenana. And only half that had been ordered  came at all--one of the two cases has not been traced to this day.  Moreover, it was not until late the next February, when actually about  to proceed on the expedition, that the writer was able to learn what  items had come and what had not. Such are the difficulties of any  undertaking in Alaska, despite all the precautions that foresight may  dictate.    The silk tents, which had not come, had to be made in Fairbanks; the  ice-axes sent were ridiculous gold-painted toys with detachable heads  and broomstick handles--more like dwarf halberds than ice-axes; and at  least two workmanlike axes were indispensable. So the head of an axe was  sawn to the pattern of the writer's out of a piece of tool steel and a  substantial hickory handle and an iron shank fitted to it at the  machine-shop in Fairbanks. It served excellently well, while the points  of the fancy axes from New York splintered the first time they were  used. \"Climbing-irons,\" or \"crampons,\" were also to make, no New York  dealer being able to supply them.    One great difficulty was the matter of footwear. Heavy regulation-nailed  alpine boots were sent--all too small to be worn with even a couple of  pairs of socks, and therefore quite useless. Indeed, at that time there  was no house in New York, or, so far as the writer knows, in the United  States, where the standard alpine equipment could be procured. As a  result of the dissatisfaction of this expedition with the material sent,  one house in New York now carries in stock a good assortment of such  things of standard pattern and quality. Fairbanks was ransacked for  boots of any kind in which three or four pairs of socks could be worn.  Alaska is a country of big men accustomed to the natural spread of the  foot which a moccasin permits, but we could not find boots to our need  save rubber snow-packs, and we bought half a dozen pairs of them (No.  12) and had leather soles fastened under them and nailed. Four pairs of  alpine boots at eleven dollars a pair equals forty-four dollars. Six  pairs of snow-packs at five dollars equals thirty dollars. Leather soles  for them at three dollars equals eighteen dollars; which totalled  ninety-two dollars--entirely wasted. We found that moccasins were the  only practicable foot-gear; and we had to put _five_ pairs of socks  within them before we were done. But we did not know that at the time  and had no means of discovering it.    All these matters were put in hand under Karstens's direction, while the  writer, only just arrived in Fairbanks from Fort Yukon and Tanana, made  a flying trip to the new mission at the Tanana Crossing, two hundred and  fifty miles above Fairbanks, with Walter and the dog team; and most of  them were finished by the time we returned. A multitude of small details  kept us several days more in Fairbanks, so that nearly the middle of  March had arrived before we were ready to make our start to the  mountain, two weeks later than we had planned.    [Sidenote: Supplies]    Karstens having joined us, we went down to the mission at Nenana  (seventy-five miles) in a couple of days, and there two more days were  spent overhauling and repacking the stuff that had come from the  outside. In the way of food, we had imported only erbswurst, seventy-two  four-ounce packages; milk chocolate, twenty pounds; compressed China tea  in tablets (a most excellent tea with a very low percentage of tannin),  five pounds; a specially selected grade of Smyrna figs, ten pounds; and  sugared almonds, ten pounds--about seventy pounds' weight, all  scrupulously reserved for the high-mountain work.    For trail equipment we had one eight-by-ten \"silk\" tent, used for two  previous winters; three small circular tents of the same material, made  in Fairbanks, for the high work; a Yukon stove and the usual complement  of pots and pans and dishes, including two admirable large aluminum pots  for melting snow, used a number of years with great satisfaction. A  \"primus\" stove, borrowed from the _Pelican's_ galley, was taken along  for the high work. The bedding was mainly of down quilts, which are  superseding fur robes and blankets for winter use because of their  lightness and warmth and the small compass into which they may be  compressed. Two pairs of camel's-hair blankets and one sleeping-bag  lined with down and camel's-hair cloth were taken, and Karstens brought  a great wolf-robe, weighing twenty-five pounds, of which we were glad  enough later on.    [Illustration: Striking across from the Tanana to the Kantishna.]    [Sidenote: Start]    Another team was obtained at the mission, and Mr. R. G. Tatum and the  two boys, Johnny and Esaias, joined the company, which, thus increased  to six persons, two sleds, and fourteen dogs, set out from Nenana across  country to the Kantishna on St. Patrick's day.    Travelling was over the beaten trail to the Kantishna gold camp, one of  the smallest of Alaskan camps, supporting about thirty men. In 1906  there was a wild stampede to this region, and two or three thousand  people went in, chiefly from the Fairbanks district. Town after town was  built--Diamond City, Glacier City, Bearpaw City, Roosevelt, McKinley  City--all with elaborate saloons and gambling-places, one, at least,  equipped with electric lights. But next summer the boom burst and all  the thousands streamed out. Gold there was and is yet, but in small  quantities only. The \"cities\" are mere collections of tumble-down huts  amongst which the moose roam at will. Interior Alaska has many such  abandoned \"cities.\" The few men now in the district have placer claims  that yield a \"grub-stake\" as a sure thing every summer, and spend their  winters chiefly in prospecting for quartz. At Diamond City, on the  Bearpaw, lay our cache of grub, and that place, some ninety miles from  Nenana and fifty miles from the base of Denali, was our present  objective point. It was bright, clear weather and the trail was good.  For thirty miles our way lay across the wide flats of the Tanana Valley,  and this stage brought us to the banks of the Nenana River. Another day  of twenty-five miles of flats brought us to Knight's comfortable  road-house and ranch on the Toklat, a tributary of the Kantishna, the  only road-house this trail can now support. Several times during these  two days we had clear glimpses of the great mountain we were  approaching, and as we came out of the flat country, the \"Sheephills,\" a  foot-hill range of Denali, much broken and deeply sculptured, rose  picturesquely before us. Our travel was now almost altogether on  \"overflow\" ice, upon the surface of swift streams that freeze solidly  over their riffles and shallows and thus deny passage under the ice to  the water of fountains and springs that never ceases flowing.

As they sat discussing New York's shortcomings over their coffee, a  young man passed them, carrying a basket, and seated himself at the  next table. He was a tall, loose-jointed young man, with unkempt  hair.    A waiter made an ingratiating gesture towards the basket, but the  young man stopped him. \"Not on your life, sonny,\" he said. \"This  stays right here.\" He placed it carefully on the floor beside his  chair, and proceeded to order dinner.    Psmith watched him thoughtfully.    \"I have a suspicion, Comrade Jackson,\" he said, \"that this will  prove to be a somewhat stout fellow. If possible, we will engage  him in conversation. I wonder what he's got in the basket. I must  get my Sherlock Holmes system to work. What is the most likely  thing for a man to have in a basket? You would reply, in your  unthinking way, 'sandwiches.' Error. A man with a basketful of  sandwiches does not need to dine at restaurants. We must try  again.\"    The young man at the next table had ordered a jug of milk to be  accompanied by a saucer. These having arrived, he proceeded to  lift the basket on to his lap, pour the milk into the saucer, and  remove the lid from the basket. Instantly, with a yell which made  the young man's table the centre of interest to all the diners, a  large grey cat shot up like a rocket, and darted across the room.  Psmith watched with silent interest.    It is hard to astonish the waiters at a New York restaurant, but  when the cat performed this feat there was a squeal of surprise all  round the room. Waiters rushed to and fro, futile but energetic.  The cat, having secured a strong strategic position on the top of a  large oil-painting which hung on the far wall, was expressing loud  disapproval of the efforts of one of the waiters to drive it from  its post with a walking-stick. The young man, seeing these  manoeuvres, uttered a wrathful shout, and rushed to the rescue.    \"Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, rising, \"we must be in this.\"    When they arrived on the scene of hostilities, the young man had  just possessed himself of the walking-stick, and was deep in a  complex argument with the head-waiter on the ethics of the matter.  The head-waiter, a stout impassive German, had taken his stand on a  point of etiquette. \"Id is,\" he said, \"to bring gats into der  grill-room vorbidden. No gendleman would gats into der grill-room  bring. Der gendleman--\"    The young man meanwhile was making enticing sounds, to which the  cat was maintaining an attitude of reserved hostility. He turned  furiously on the head-waiter.    \"For goodness' sake,\" he cried, \"can't you see the poor brute's  scared stiff? Why don't you clear your gang of German comedians  away, and give her a chance to come down?\"    \"Der gendleman--\" argued the head-waiter.    Psmith stepped forward and touched him on the arm.    \"May I have a word with you in private?\"    \"Zo?\"    Psmith drew him away.    \"You don't know who that is?\" he whispered, nodding towards the  young man.    \"No gendleman he is,\" asserted the head-waiter. \"Der gendleman  would not der gat into--\"    Psmith shook his head pityingly.    \"These petty matters of etiquette are not for his Grace--but, hush,  he wishes to preserve his incognito.\"    \"Ingognito?\"    \"You understand. You are a man of the world, Comrade--may I call  you Freddie? You understand, Comrade Freddie, that in a man in his  Grace's position a few little eccentricities may be pardoned. You  follow me, Frederick?\"    The head-waiter's eye rested upon the young man with a new interest  and respect.    \"He is noble?\" he inquired with awe.    \"He is here strictly incognito, you understand,\" said Psmith  warningly. The head-waiter nodded.    The young man meanwhile had broken down the cat's reserve, and  was now standing with her in his arms, apparently anxious to  fight all-comers in her defence. The head-waiter approached  deferentially.    \"Der gendleman,\" he said, indicating Psmith, who beamed in a  friendly manner through his eye-glass, \"haf everything exblained.  All will now quite satisfactory be.\"    The young man looked inquiringly at Psmith, who winked  encouragingly. The head-waiter bowed.    \"Let me present Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, \"the pet of our  English Smart Set. I am Psmith, one of the Shropshire Psmiths. This  is a great moment. Shall we be moving back? We were about to order  a second instalment of coffee, to correct the effects of a  fatiguing day. Perhaps you would care to join us?\"    \"Sure,\" said the alleged duke.    \"This,\" said Psmith, when they were seated, and the head-waiter had  ceased to hover, \"is a great meeting. I was complaining with some  acerbity to Comrade Jackson, before you introduced your very  interesting performing-animal speciality, that things in New York  were too quiet, too decorous. I have an inkling, Comrade--\"    \"Windsor's my name.\"    \"I have an inkling, Comrade Windsor, that we see eye to eye on the  subject.\"    \"I guess that's right. I was raised in the plains, and I lived in  Kentucky a while. There's more doing there in a day than there is  here in a month. Say, how did you fix it with the old man?\"    \"With Comrade Freddie? I have a certain amount of influence with  him. He is content to order his movements in the main by my  judgment. I assured him that all would be well, and he yielded.\"  Psmith gazed with interest at the cat, which was lapping milk from  the saucer. \"Are you training that animal for a show of some kind,  Comrade Windsor, or is it a domestic pet?\"    \"I've adopted her. The office-boy on our paper got her away from a  dog this morning, and gave her to me.\"    \"Your paper?\"    \"_Cosy Moments_,\" said Billy Windsor, with a touch of shame.    \"_Cosy Moments_?\" said Psmith reflectively. \"I regret that the  bright little sheet has not come my way up to the present. I must  seize an early opportunity of perusing it.\"    \"Don't you do it.\"    \"You've no paternal pride in the little journal?\"    \"It's bad enough to hurt,\" said Billy Windsor disgustedly. \"If you  really want to see it, come along with me to my place, and I'll  show you a copy.\"    \"It will be a pleasure,\" said Psmith. \"Comrade Jackson, have you  any previous engagement for to-night?\"    \"I'm not doing anything,\" said Mike.    \"Then let us stagger forth with Comrade Windsor. While he is  loading up that basket, we will be collecting our hats. . . . I am  not half sure, Comrade Jackson,\" he added, as they walked out,  \"that Comrade Windsor may not prove to be the genial spirit for  whom I have been searching. If you could give me your undivided  company, I should ask no more. But with you constantly away,  mingling with the gay throng, it is imperative that I have some  solid man to accompany me in my ramblings hither and thither. It is  possible that Comrade Windsor may possess the qualifications  necessary for the post. But here he comes. Let us foregather with  him and observe him in private life before arriving at any  premature decision.\"        CHAPTER IV    BAT JARVIS    Billy Windsor lived in a single room on East Fourteenth Street.  Space in New York is valuable, and the average bachelor's  apartments consist of one room with a bathroom opening off it.  During the daytime this one room loses all traces of being used for  sleeping purposes at night. Billy Windsor's room was very much like  a public-school study. Along one wall ran a settee. At night this  became a bed; but in the daytime it was a settee and nothing but a  settee. There was no space for a great deal of furniture. There was  one rocking-chair, two ordinary chairs, a table, a book-stand, a  typewriter--nobody uses pens in New York--and on the walls a mixed  collection of photographs, drawings, knives, and skins, relics of  their owner's prairie days. Over the door was the head of a young  bear.    Billy's first act on arriving in this sanctum was to release the  cat, which, having moved restlessly about for some moments, finally  came to the conclusion that there was no means of getting out, and  settled itself on a corner of the settee. Psmith, sinking  gracefully down beside it, stretched out his legs and lit a  cigarette. Mike took one of the ordinary chairs; and Billy Windsor,  planting himself in the rocker, began to rock rhythmically to and  fro, a performance which he kept up untiringly all the time.    \"A peaceful scene,\" observed Psmith. \"Three great minds, keen,  alert, restless during business hours, relax. All is calm and  pleasant chit-chat. You have snug quarters up here, Comrade  Windsor. I hold that there is nothing like one's own roof-tree.  It is a great treat to one who, like myself, is located in one of  these vast caravanserai--to be exact, the Astor--to pass a few  moments in the quiet privacy of an apartment such as this.\"    \"It's beastly expensive at the Astor,\" said Mike.    \"The place has that drawback also. Anon, Comrade Jackson, I think  we will hunt around for some such cubby-hole as this, built for  two. Our nervous systems must be conserved.\"    \"On Fourth Avenue,\" said Billy Windsor, \"you can get quite good  flats very cheap. Furnished, too. You should move there. It's not  much of a neighbourhood. I don't know if you mind that?\"    \"Far from it, Comrade Windsor. It is my aim to see New York in all  its phases. If a certain amount of harmless revelry can be whacked  out of Fourth Avenue, we must dash there with the vim of  highly-trained smell-dogs. Are you with me, Comrade Jackson?\"    \"All right,\" said Mike.    \"And now, Comrade Windsor, it would be a pleasure to me to peruse  that little journal of which you spoke. I have had so few  opportunities of getting into touch with the literature of this  great country.\"    Billy Windsor stretched out an arm and pulled a bundle of papers  from the book-stand. He tossed them on to the settee by Psmith's  side.    \"There you are,\" he said, \"if you "]]]
