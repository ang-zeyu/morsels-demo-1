All was terror and confusion.    Then with a roar the lion sprang upon the princess, and bore her to the  ground; but ere he could tear her to pieces, Ahmed had sprang forward,  seized a piece of iron, one end of which was red hot, from the shop of  a blacksmith, and thrust it furiously into the face of the lion. With a  cry of pain and rage the lion left the princess and bounded off to the  bazaars, where he did great damage.    As soon as the princess had recovered from her fright, she beckoned to  Ahmed to come near, and removing her veil, told him he was a brave  little fellow, and ordered one of her servants to give him a purse of  gold. Ahmed had never seen anyone so beautiful, and was so lost in  wonder, that before he could find words of thanks, the party had passed  on.    But when the money was spent, Ahmed and his father began to be in want  again. A Jewish pedlar having told him how much better trade was in the  capital, they determined to set forth to that city, though the way was  long and full of danger. \"Better to die in the desert, than in the  heart of a great city,\" said Ahmed.    So they set forth on their journey, sometimes climbing up winding paths  among the mountains, at other times traversing the desert, footsore,  and weary almost to death, often hungry and thirsty, tormented by the  thought that they would fall into the hands of the man-stealing robbers  who haunted this great pilgrim road.    On account of the intense heat and the cruel robbers, they traveled by  night. In every shadow cast by the moon upon the ground, they thought  they saw a robber on his big horse. During the day they slept at  wayside inns, and in return for little services rendered by Ahmed to  the muleteers, they would give him a handful of rice or bread, or a few  dried fruits which kept them from starvation.    So it went on until one night, when searching for the bridge that  crosses the Salt River, the sky became suddenly overcast, the rain fell  in torrents, and soon the river was in flood. There was nothing to be  done but to sit down and wait until the moon should rise. The fierce  wind buffeted them, the rain drenched them; they had lost their way,  and were at the mercy of wild beasts.    Once, when the wind dropped for a little, out of the darkness came a  groan. \"Keep still as death, my son,\" said the father to Ahmed, \"for it  is the Old Man of the Desert.\"    Now Ahmed had never before heard of the Old Man of the Desert, and  therefore knew no fear, so despite his father's warning, he got up and  went in the direction from whence came the groans. As he reached the  spot, the moon came out from behind a bank of clouds, and Ahmed saw a  poor dervish lying on the sand. He had a leopard skin thrown over his  shoulders; by his side lay a big stick studded with sharp nails, and a  basin made of the outer skin of a pumpkin in which he collected alms.    \"For the sake of the Prophet,\" he moaned when he saw Ahmed, \"give me a  drink of water.\" And Ahmed, filling his pitcher from the river gave him  to drink, though the water was somewhat salty.    The water revived the dervish, and he said: \"I am Ali, the dervish, and  am known throughout Persia. Two months ago I left Mazandaran to go to  Meshed. But yesterday the fever seized me. This is the third attack,  and, as you know, it is always fatal.    \"Stay with me, my son, in this dark hour when I shall pass through the  valley of the shadow of death. And when my soul shall have crossed the  Bridge of Death, take this little leather bag hanging round my neck,  and therein you shall find a tiny cup, cut from a crystal, which if  used rightly, shall lift thee to great power and wealth.    \"Each morning when you rise, place a drop of pure water in the cup, and  look intently therein, and should any danger threaten you or those near  and dear to you, it will be made manifest. And if--\" but here his  strength failed him, his head fell back, and he passed away. Ahmed  found the bag and the beautifully cut crystal, just as the dervish had  said, and returning to his father, told him all that had happened.    Ahmed did as the dervish had directed him for several mornings, but  seeing nothing in the crystal, he dropped the practice. There came a  day, however, when they were overtaken by a dreadful dust storm. From  across the wide stretch of sand, the wind raged, the sky and sun were  blotted out, the air was laden with dust, and the small pebbles and  stones carried in the wind cut them until they cried with pain. Shelter  there was none.    In fear and pain they ran here and there, and when after several hours  of misery, the storm had passed, they could not see each other. They  were lost in the cruel desert, with no food, and worse still, no water.  Sobbing in despair, Ahmed straggled on. He went like one in a dream.  Time after time he fell tripping over rocks and bushes, but he pressed  onward. Then came a time when he could go no further, and he lay down  to die.    For a long time he slept, and then he was awakened by being shaken.  Looking up, he saw an old man smiling and saying: \"Why, it's little  Ahmed, the son of Abdullah, the Soap Seller. Don't you know me, Ahmed?  I am your uncle. Don't cry because you have lost your way. Come, take  my hand and we will soon find your father.\"    Now Ahmed wondered why he had never seen or even heard his father speak  of this particular uncle, but he took the old man's hand, and together  they set forth. Mile after mile they went, but no trace of his father  could be found. Then he sat down crying, and said: \"I am so tired, I  can go no further.\" And the old man replied: \"Sleep, my son, while I  keep watch.\"    But just as Ahmed was closing his eyes, the old man turned, and Ahmed  saw that he had thin legs like those of a sheep. \"The Ghool! the  Ghool!\" he shrieked, and fainted. Then this wicked ogre of the desert  began to open Ahmed's coat in order to suck his blood.    But another cry answered that of the boy, and then appeared on the  scene a beautiful young woman, carrying in her harid a necklace of gold  and silver beads. Casting but one glance at the beads, the old man flew  swifter than the wild sheep of the mountains, for the sight of metal  rendered him powerless to do harm.    Of course, it was the princess whose life Ahmed had saved in Meshed.  The King, her father, happened to be returning from a pilgrimage, and  to give a fright to her servants, she had scampered off the track, and  thus had found Ahmed. At her request, Ahmed became one of the King's  followers, and together with his father, whom they found the next day,  they journeyed to the capital.    Some three days' march from the capital, in the mountains near Kazveen,  there lived the Old Man of the Mountains, or as he is generally known,  the King of the Assassins, with his followers. So great was his power  that he had but to say the word and any of his men would throw  themselves from the topmost crags to the valleys beneath and be dashed  to pieces, or at his bidding, they would travel forth to the most  distant parts of the world in order to kill any persons, however great  they might be.    When he heard that the King of Persia was collecting an army to destroy  both him and his tribe, he became very angry, and said to one of his  followers: \"Go, rid me of the King of Persia;\" and the mart-took bread  and water and a sharp dagger, and went.    Now after his narrow escape from the Old Man of the Desert, Ahmed took  pains every morning to place a drop of water in the crystal cup and  look therein. Nothing appeared until one morning he saw in the bead of  water a vision of the King asleep, and standing by him a robber with an  uplifted dagger, about to strike. Hurrying to the King's presence, he  warned him of the danger, but the King only laughed, for he trusted his  guards.    Nevertheless, Ahmed determined to keep watch. Darkness came, and the  guards slept. The palace was silent. The hours slipped by, and Ahmed,  weary with much waiting was about to retire, when he perceived a dark  shadow creeping into that part of the palace where the King slept.    The figure noiselessly made its way to the very threshold of the King's  room, when Ahmed sprang upon it, at the same time giving the alarm. The  whole palace was aroused and the murdered secured.    When the messenger did not return, the Old Man of the Mountains sent a  second, and then a third, and finally the most daring and skilful of  all his followers; but thanks to Ahmed's crystal cup, all attempts upon  the life of the King failed.    Then the King sent for Ahmed, and said: \"Ask for anything in reason,  and it shall be given thee.\" And though he was trembling in every limb,  Ahmed replied: \"Neither wealth nor power does thy slave desire, save  the hand of thy daughter.\"    \"If she loves you, it shall be so,\" replied the King, and she did love  him; they were married, and Ahmed became the King's Prime Minister.        THE KING'S TREASURE    PERSIAN FAIRY TALES      The King's Treasure      Accurately relating how a marked advance in material and political  prosperity accrued to Abdul Karim, and the part played by a monarch  whose philosophy included the immediate advancement of a worthy  subject.      A LABORING man named Abdul Karim, with his wife, Zeeba--\"the beautiful  one\"--lived in a sheltered valley, surrounded by hills, the sides of  which were covered with fine gardens, in which the peach, the grape,  the mulberry, and other delicious fruits grew in great profusion.    Although his wife's name was Zeeba, as a matter of fact, she was very  plain in appearance. But from having been named Zeeba, she really  thought she was beautiful, and thus it came about that, moved by  vanity, her two children were named, the boy, Yusuf, or Joseph, who as  you know, was sold by his brethren into Egypt and became next to the  King; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#3)"],[1," the pater-patratus to the  Numantines, who, however, like the Samnites in the former case,  refused to receive him. /2/    It might be asked what analogy could have been found between a  breach of contract and those wrongs which excite the desire for  vengeance. But it must be remembered that the distinction between  tort and breaches of contract, and especially between the  remedies for the two, is not found ready made. It is conceivable  that a procedure adapted to redress for violence was extended to  other cases as they arose. Slaves were surrendered for theft as  well as [14] for assault; /1/ and it is said that a debtor who  did not pay his debts, or a seller who failed to deliver an  article for which he had been paid, was dealt with on the same  footing as a thief. /2/ This line of thought, together with the  quasi material conception of legal obligations as binding the  offending body, which has been noticed, would perhaps explain the  well-known law of the Twelve Tables as to insolvent debtors.  According to that law, if a man was indebted to several creditors  and insolvent, after certain formalities they might cut up his  body and divide it among them. If there was a single creditor, he  might put his debtor to death or sell him as a slave. /3/    If no other right were given but to reduce a debtor to slavery,  the law might be taken to look only to compensation, and to be  modelled on the natural working of self-redress. /4/ The  principle of our own law, that taking a man's body on execution  satisfies the debt, although he is not detained an hour, seems to  be explained in that way. But the right to put to death looks  like vengeance, and the division of the body shows that the debt  was conceived very literally to inhere in or bind the body with a  vinculum juris.    Whatever may be the true explanation of surrender in connection  with contracts, for the present purpose we need not go further  than the common case of noxoe deditio for wrongs. Neither is the  seeming adhesion of liability to the very body which did the harm  of the first importance. [15] The Roman law dealt mainly with  living creatures,--with animals and slaves. If a man was run  over, it did not surrender the wagon which crushed him, but the  ox which drew the wagon. /1/ At this stage the notion is easy to  understand. The desire for vengeance may be felt as strongly  against a slave as against a freeman, and it is not without  example nowadays that a like passion should be felt against an  animal. The surrender of the slave or beast empowered the injured  party to do his will upon them. Payment by the owner was merely a  privilege in case he wanted to buy the vengeance off.    It will readily be imagined that such a system as has been  described could not last when civilization had advanced to any  considerable height. What had been the privilege of buying off  vengeance by agreement, of paying the damage instead of  surrendering the body of the offender, no doubt became a general  custom. The Aquilian law, passed about a couple of centuries  later than the date of the Twelve Tables, enlarged the sphere of  compensation for bodily injuries. Interpretation enlarged the  Aquilian law. Masters became personally liable for certain wrongs  committed by their slaves with their knowledge, where previously  they were only bound to surrender the slave. /2/ If a pack-mule  threw off his burden upon a passer-by because he had been  improperly overloaded, or a dog which might have been restrained  escaped from his master and bit any one, the old noxal action, as  it was called, gave way to an action under the new law to enforce  a general personal liability. /3/ Still later, ship-owners and  innkeepers were made liable [16] as if they were wrong-doers for  wrongs committed by those in their employ on board ship or in the  tavern, although of course committed without their knowledge. The  true reason for this exceptional responsibility was the  exceptional confidence which was necessarily reposed in carriers  and innkeepers. /1/ But some of the jurists, who regarded the  surrender of children and slaves as a privilege intended to limit  liability, explained this new liability on the ground that the  innkeeper or ship-owner was to a certain degree guilty of  negligence in having employed the services of bad men? This was  the first instance of a master being made unconditionally liable  for the wrongs of his servant. The reason given for it was of  general application, and the principle expanded to the scope of  the reason.    The law as to ship-owners and innkeepers introduced another and  more startling innovation. It made them responsible when those  whom they employed were free, as well as when they were slaves.  /3/ For the first time one man was made answerable for the wrongs  of another who was also answerable himself, and who had a  standing before the law. This was a great change from the bare  permission to ransom one's slave as a privilege. But here we have  the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant,  and principal and agent. All servants are now as free and as  liable to a suit as their masters. Yet the principle introduced  on special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves,  is now the general law of this country and England, and under it  men daily have to pay large sums for other people's acts, in  which they had no part and [17] for which they are in no sense to  blame. And to this day the reason offered by the Roman jurists  for an exceptional rule is made to justify this universal and  unlimited responsibility. /1/    So much for one of the parents of our common law. Now let us turn  for a moment to the Teutonic side. The Salic Law embodies usages  which in all probability are of too early a date to have been  influenced either by Rome or the Old Testament. The thirty-sixth  chapter of the ancient text provides that, if a man is killed by  a domestic animal, the owner of the animal shall pay half the  composition (which he would have had to pay to buy off the blood  feud had he killed the man himself), and for the other half give  up the beast to the complainant. /2/ So, by chapter thirty-five,  if a slave killed a freeman, he was to be surrendered for one  half of the composition to the relatives of the slain man, and  the master was to pay the other half. But according to the gloss,  if the slave or his master had been maltreated by the slain man  or his relatives, the master had only to surrender the slave. /3/  It is interesting to notice that those Northern sources which  Wilda takes to represent a more primitive stage of German law  confine liability for animals to surrender alone. /4/ There is  also a trace of the master's having been able to free himself in  some cases, at a later date, by showing that the slave was no  longer in [18] his possession. /1/ There are later provisions  making a master liable for the wrongs committed by his slave by  his command. /2/ In the laws adapted by the Thuringians from the  earlier sources, it is provided in terms that the master is to  pay for all damage done by his slaves. /4/    In short, so far as I am able to trace the order of development  in the customs of the German tribes, it seems to have been  entirely similar to that which we have already followed in the  growth of Roman law. The earlier liability for slaves and animals  was mainly confined to surrender; the later became personal, as  at Rome.    The reader may begin to ask for the proof that all this has any  bearing on our law of today. So far as concerns the influence of  the Roman law upon our own, especially the Roman law of master  and servant, the evidence of it is to be found in every book  which has been written for the last five hundred years. It has  been stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the  Roman lawyers, empty as it is, to the present day. It will be  seen directly whether the German folk-laws can also be followed  into England.    In the Kentish laws of Hlothhaere and Eadrie (A.D. 680) [19] it  is said, \"If any one's slave slay a freeman, whoever it be, let  the owner pay with a hundred shillings, give up the slayer,\" &c.  /1/ There are several other similar provisions. In the nearly  contemporaneous laws of Ine, the surrender and payment are simple  alternatives. \"If a Wessex slave slay an Englishman, then shall  he who owns him deliver him up to the lord and the kindred, or  give sixty shillings for his life.\" /2/ Alfred's laws (A.D.  871-901) have a like provision as to cattle. \"If a neat wound a  man, let the neat be delivered up or compounded for.\" /3/ And  Alfred, although two hundred years later than the first English  lawgivers who have been quoted, seems to have gone back to more  primitive notions than we find before his time. For the same  principle is extended to the case of a tree by which a man is  killed. \"If, at their common work, one man slay another  unwilfully, let the tree be given to the kindred, and let them  have it off the land within thirty nights. Or let him take  possession of it who owns the wood.\" /4/    It is not inapposite to compare what Mr. Tylor has mentioned  concerning the rude Kukis of Southern Asia. \"If a tiger killed a  Kuki, his family were in disgrace till they had retaliated by  killing and eating this tiger, or another; but further, if a man  was killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their  revenge by cutting the tree down, and scattering it in chips.\"  /5/    To return to the English, the later laws, from about a hundred  years after Alfred down to the collection known as the laws of  Henry I, compiled long after the Conquest, [20] increase the  lord's liability for his household, and make him surety for his  men's good conduct. If they incur a fine to the king and run  away, the lord has to pay it unless he can clear himself of  complicity. But I cannot say that I find until a later"]]]
