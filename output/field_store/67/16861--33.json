This was all very well while the caliphate was strong, but when it grew  weak the situation altered. Rising everywhere to positions of authority,  the Turkish mercenaries began to act like masters. Opening the eastern  frontiers, they let in fresh swarms of their countrymen, who now came,  not as individuals, but in tribes or \"hordes\" under their hereditary  chiefs, wandering about at their own sweet will, settling where they  pleased, and despoiling or evicting the local inhabitants.    The Turks soon renounced their ancestral paganism for Islam, but Islam  made little change in their natures. In judging these Turkish newcomers  we must not consider them the same as the present-day Ottoman Turks of  Constantinople and Asia Minor. The modern Osmanli are so saturated with  European and Near Eastern blood, and have been so leavened by Western  and Saracenic ideas, they that are a very different people from their  remote immigrant ancestors. Yet, even as it is, the modern Osmanli  display enough of those unlovely Turanian traits which characterize the  unmodified Turks of central Asia, often called \"Turkomans,\" to  distinguish them from their Ottoman kinsfolk to the west.    Now, what was the primitive Turkish nature? First and foremost, it was  that of the professional soldier. Discipline was the Turk's watchword.  No originality of thought, and but little curiosity. Few ideas ever  penetrated the Turk's slow mind, and the few that did penetrate were  received as military orders, to be obeyed without question and adhered  to without reflection. Such was the being who took over the leadership  of Islam from the Saracen's failing grasp.    No greater misfortune could have occurred both for Islam and for the  world at large. For Islam it meant the rule of dull-witted bigots under  which enlightened progress was impossible. Of course Islam did gain a  great accession of warlike strength, but this new power was so wantonly  misused as to bring down disastrous repercussions upon Islam itself.  The first notable exploits of the immigrant Turkish hordes were their  conquest of Asia Minor and their capture of Jerusalem, both events  taking place toward the close of the eleventh century[4]. Up to this  time Asia Minor had remained part of the Christian world. The original  Arab flood of the seventh century, after overrunning Syria, had been  stopped by the barrier of the Taurus Mountains; the Byzantine Empire had  pulled itself together; and thenceforth, despite border bickerings, the  Byzantine-Saracen frontier had remained substantially unaltered. Now,  however, the Turks broke the Byzantine barrier, overran Asia Minor, and  threatened even Constantinople, the eastern bulwark of Christendom. As  for Jerusalem, it had, of course, been in Moslem hands since the Arab  conquest of A.D. 637, but the caliph Omar had carefully respected the  Christian \"Holy Places,\" and his successors had neither persecuted the  local Christians nor maltreated the numerous pilgrims who flocked  perennially to Jerusalem from every part of the Christian world. But the  Turks changed all this. Avid for loot, and filled with bigoted hatred of  the \"Misbelievers,\" they sacked the holy places, persecuted the  Christians, and rendered pilgrimage impossible.    The effect of these twin disasters upon Christendom, occurring as they  did almost simultaneously, was tremendous. The Christian West, then at  the height of its religious fervour, quivered with mingled fear and  wrath. Myriads of zealots, like Peter the Hermit, roused all Europe to  frenzy. Fanaticism begat fanaticism, and the Christian West poured upon  the Moslem East vast hosts of warriors in those extraordinary  expeditions, the Crusades.    The Turkish conquest of Islam and its counterblast, the Crusades, were  an immense misfortune for the world. They permanently worsened the  relations between East and West. In the year A.D. 1000 Christian-Moslem  relations were fairly good, and showed every prospect of becoming  better. The hatreds engendered by Islam's first irruption were dying  away. The frontiers of Islam and Christendom had become apparently  fixed, and neither side showed much desire to encroach upon the other.  The only serious debatable ground was Spain, where Moslem and Christian  were continually at hand-grips; but, after all, Spain was mutually  regarded as a frontier episode. Between Islam and Christendom, as a  whole, intercourse was becoming steadily more friendly and more  frequent. This friendly intercourse, if continued, might ultimately have  produced momentous results for human progress. The Moslem world was at  that time still well ahead of western Europe in knowledge and culture,  but Saracenic civilization was ossifying, whereas the Christian West,  despite its ignorance, rudeness, and barbarism, was bursting with lusty  life and patently aspiring to better things. Had the nascent amity of  East and West in the eleventh century continued to develop, both would  have greatly profited. In the West the influence of Saracenic culture,  containing, as it did, the ancient learning of Greece and Rome, might  have awakened our Renaissance much earlier, while in the East the  influence of the mediaeval West, with its abounding vigour, might have  saved Moslem civilization from the creeping paralysis which was  overtaking it.    But it was not to be. In Islam the refined, easygoing Saracen gave place  to the bigoted, brutal Turk. Islam became once more aggressive--not, as  in its early days, for an ideal, but for sheer blood-lust, plunder, and  destruction. Henceforth it was war to the knife between the only  possible civilization and the most brutal and hopeless barbarism.  Furthermore, this war was destined to last for centuries. The Crusades  were merely Western counter-attacks against a Turkish assault on  Christendom which continued for six hundred years and was definitely  broken only under the walls of Vienna in 1683. Naturally, from these  centuries of unrelenting strife furious hatreds and fanaticisms were  engendered which still envenom the relations of Islam and Christendom.  The atrocities of Mustapha Kemal's Turkish \"Nationalists\" and the  atrocities of the Greek troops in Asia Minor, of which we read in our  morning papers, are in no small degree a \"carrying on\" of the mutual  atrocities of Turks and Crusaders in Palestine eight hundred years ago.    With the details of those old wars between Turks and Christians this  book has no direct concern. The wars themselves should simply be noted  as a chronic barrier between East and West. As for the Moslem East, with  its declining Saracenic civilization bowed beneath the brutal Turkish  yoke, it was presently exposed to even more terrible misfortunes. These  misfortunes were also of Turanian origin. Toward the close of the  twelfth century the eastern branches of the Turanian race were welded  into a temporary unity by the genius of a mighty chieftain named Jenghiz  Khan. Taking the sinister title of \"The Inflexible Emperor,\" this  arch-savage started out to loot the world. He first overran northern  China, which he hideously ravaged, then turned his devastating course  toward the west. Such was the rise of the terrible \"Mongols,\" whose name  still stinks in the nostrils of civilized mankind. Carrying with them  skilled Chinese engineers using gunpowder for the reduction of fortified  cities, Jenghiz Khan and his mounted hosts proved everywhere  irresistible. The Mongols were the most appalling barbarians whom the  world has ever seen. Their object was not conquest for settlement, not  even loot, but in great part a sheer satanic lust for blood and  destruction. They revelled in butchering whole populations, destroying  cities, laying waste countrysides--and then passing on to fresh fields.    Jenghiz Khan died after a few years of his westward progress, but his  successors continued his work with unabated zeal. Both Christendom and  Islam were smitten by the Mongol scourge. All eastern Europe was ravaged  and re-barbarized, the Russians showing ugly traces of the Mongol  imprint to this day. But the woes of Christendom were as nothing to the  woes of Islam. The Mongols never penetrated beyond Poland, and western  Europe, the seat of Western civilization, was left unscathed. Not so  Islam. Pouring down from the north-east, the Mongol hosts whirled like a  cyclone over the Moslem world from India to Egypt, pillaging, murdering,  and destroying. The nascent civilization of mediaeval Persia, just  struggling into the light beneath the incubus of Turkish harryings, was  stamped flat under the Mongol hoofs, and the Mongols then proceeded to  deal with the Moslem culture-centre--Bagdad. Bagdad had declined  considerably from the gorgeous days of Haroun-al-Rashid, with its  legendary million souls. However, it was still a great city, the seat of  the caliphate and the unquestioned centre of Saracenic civilization. The  Mongols stormed it (A.D. 1258), butchered its entire population, and  literally wiped Bagdad off the face of the earth. And even this was not  the worst. Bagdad was the capital of Mesopotamia. This \"Land between the  Rivers\" had, in the very dawn of history, been reclaimed from swamp and  desert by the patient labours of half-forgotten peoples who, with  infinite toil, built up a marvellous system of irrigation that made  Mesopotamia the perennial garden and granary of the world. Ages had  passed and Mesopotamia had known many masters, but all these conquerors  had respected, even cherished, the irrigation works which were the  source of all prosperity. These works the Mongols wantonly, methodically  destroyed. The oldest civilization in the world, the cradle of human  culture, was hopelessly ruined; at least eight thousand years of  continuous human effort went for naught, and Mesopotamia"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24108"],[0,"Fables in Rhyme for Little Folks (#3)"],[1,"t--  As the Tortoise was as nearing the place.    Too late! Though he sped like a dart,  The Tortoise was first. She was smart:  \"You can surely run fast,\"  She remarked. \"Yet you're last.  It is better to get a good start.\"        The Heron Who Was Hard To Please.    A long-legged Heron, with long neck and beak,  Set out for a stroll by the bank of a creek.  So clear was the water that if you looked sharp  You could see the pike caper around with the carp.  The Heron might quickly have speared enough fish  To make for his dinner a capital dish.  But he was a very particular bird:  His food fixed \"just so,\" at the hours he preferred.  And hence he decided 'twas better to wait,  Since his appetite grew when he supped rather late.  Pretty soon he was hungry, and stalked to the bank.  Where some pondfish were leaping--a fish of low rank.  \"Bah, Bah!\" said the Bird. \"Sup on these? No--not I.  I'm known as a Heron: as such I live high.\"  Then some gudgeon swam past that were tempting to see,  But the Heron said hautily: \"No--not for me.  For those I'd not bother to open my beak,  If I had to hang 'round come next Friday a week.\"  Thus bragged the big Bird. But he's bound to confess  That he opened his elegant beak for much less.  Not another fish came. When he found all else fail,  He was happy to happen upon a fat snail.        The Raven Who Would Rival The Eagle.    An Eagle swooped from out the sky,  And carried off a sheep.  A Raven seeing him, said: \"I  Could do that too if I should try.  His meal comes mighty cheap.\"    Of all that well-fed flock was one  As fat as fat could be.  The Raven rose, and lit upon  Her back. She seemed to weigh a ton--  So very fat was she.    And, oh! Her wool was wondrous thick:  It would have made a mat.  The Raven's claws are caught, and stick!  He's played himself a pretty trick--  To fly with one so fat.    \"Ba, ba!\" \"Caw, caw!\" cry bird and beast.  The shepherd comes at last:  Sir Raven who would find a feast  Is from the woolly one released,  And in a cage kept fast.        The Miller, His Son And The Ass.    A Miller and Son once set out for the fair,  To sell a fine ass they had brought up with care;  And the way that they started made everyone stare.    To keep the Ass fresh, so the beast would sell dear  On a pole they slung him. It surely seemed queer:  He looked, with heels up, like some huge chandelier.    One person who passed them cried out in great glee.  \"Was there anything ever so silly?\" said he.  \"Can you guess who the greatest Ass is of those three?\"    The Miller at once put the brute on the ground;  And the Ass, who had liked to ride t'other way round,  Complained in language of curious sound.    No matter. The Miller now made his Son ride,  While he followed after or walked alongside.  Then up came three merchants. The eldest one cried;    \"Get down there, young fellow! I never did see  Such manners:--a gray-beard walks where you should be.  He should ride, you should follow. Just take that from me!\"    \"Dear Sirs,\" quoth the Miller, \"I'd see you content.\"  He climbed to the saddle; on foot the boy went...  Three girls passed. Said one: \"Do you see that old Gent?  There he sits, like a bishop. I say it's a shame,  While that boy trudging after seems more than half lame.\"  \"Little girl,\" said the Miller, \"go back whence you came.\"    Yet this young creature so worked on his mind  That he wanted no woman to call him unkind:  And he said to his Son: \"Seat yourself here--behind.\"    With the Ass bearing double they jogged on again,  And once more met a critic, who said: \"It is plain  Only dunces would give their poor donkey such pain.  He will die with their weight: it's a shame and a sin.  For their faithful servant they care not a pin.  They'll have nothing to sell at the fair but his skin.\"    \"Dear me!\" said the Miller, \"what am I to do?  Must I suit the whole world and the world's father, too?  Yet it must end some time--so I'll see the thing through.\"    Both Father and Son now decided to walk,  While the Ass marched in front with a strut and a stalk;  Yet the people who passed them continued to talk.    Said one to another: \"Look there, if you please,  How they wear out their shoes, while their Ass takes his ease.  Were there ever, d'ye think, three such asses as these?\"  Said the Miller: \"You're right. I'm an Ass! It is true.  Too long have I listened to people like you.  But now I am done with the whole kit and crew.    \"Let them blame me or praise me, keep silent or yell,  My goings and comings they cannot compel.  I will do as I please!\"...So he did--and did well."]]]
