It is noted that some Gallinules, when  young, crawl on bushes by wing claws. The voice somewhat resembles the  cackling or clucking of a hen. It eats the tender shoots of young corn,  grass, and various kinds of grain. When the breeding season approaches,  the mated pairs generally resort to rice fields, concealing themselves  among the reeds and rushes. Mr. Woodruff noted that when the railway  trains pass through the over-flowed districts about Galveston, the birds  fly up along the track in large multitudes.    The Purple Gallinules are stoutly built birds, with a high and strong  bill, and their remarkably long toes, which enable them to walk readily  over the water plants, are frequently employed to hold the food, very  much in the manner of a parrot, while eating.        O, purple-breasted Gallinule      Why should thy beauty cause thee fear?      Why should the huntsman seek to fool      Thy innocence, and bring thee near      His deadly tool of fire and lead?      Thou holdest high thy stately head!      Would that the hunter might consent      To leave thee in thy sweet content.--C. C. M.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  PURPLE GALLINULE.]           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  SMITH'S LONGSPUR.]    SMITH'S PAINTED LONGSPUR.      Smith's Painted Longspur is usually considered a rare bird in the middle  west, but a recent observer found it very common in the fields. He saw  twenty-five on October 3rd of last year. They were associated with a  large flock of Lapland Longspurs. On account of its general resemblance  to the latter species it is often overlooked. It is found in the  interior of North America from the Arctic coast to Illinois and Texas,  breeding far north, where it has a thick, fur-lined, grass nest, set in  moss on the ground. Like the Lapland Longspur, it is only a winter  visitor. It is not so generally distributed as that species, the  migrations being wholly confined to the open prairie districts. Painted  Longspurs are generally found in large flocks, and when once on the  ground begin to sport. They run very nimbly, and when they arise utter a  sharp click, repeated several times in quick succession, and move with  an easy undulating motion for a short distance, when they alight very  suddenly, seeming to fall perpendicularly several feet to the ground.  They prefer the roots where the grass is shortest. When in the air they  fly in circles, to and fro, for a few minutes, and then alight, keeping  up a constant chirping or call. They seem to prefer the wet portions of  the prairie. In the breeding seasons the Longspur's song has much of  charm, and is uttered like the Skylark's while soaring. The Longspur is  a ground feeder, and the mark of his long hind claw, or spur, can often  be seen in the new snow. In 1888 the writer saw a considerable flock of  Painted Longspurs feeding along the Niagara river near Fort Erie,  Canada.    The usual number of eggs found in a nest is four or five, and the nests,  for the most part, are built of fine dry grasses, carefully arranged and  lined with down, feathers, or finer materials similar to those of the  outer portions. They are sometimes sunk in an excavation made by the  birds, or in a tuft of grass, and in one instance, placed in the midst  of a bed of Labrador tea. When the nest is approached, the female  quietly slips off, while the male bird may be seen hopping or flying  from tree to tree in the neighborhood of the nest and doing all he can  to induce intruders to withdraw from the neighborhood. The eggs have a  light clay-colored ground, marked with obscure blotches of lavender and  darker lines, dots, and blotches of purplish brown. The Longspur is a  strong flier, and seems to delight in breasting the strongest gales,  when all the other birds appear to move with difficulty, and to keep  themselves concealed among the grass. While the colors of adult males  are very different in the Longspur family, the females have a decided  resemblance. The markings of the male are faintly indicated, but the  black and buff are wanting.          THE AMERICAN CROSS BILL.      American Crossbills are notable for their small size, being considered  and described as dwarfs of the family. Their food consists exclusively  of pine, fir, and larch, which accounts for the fact that they are more  numerous in Northern latitudes where these trees abound. When the cones  are abundant they visit in great numbers many places where they have not  been for years, appearing at irregular intervals, and not confining  themselves to particular localities.    They are very social even during the nesting season. Their nests are  built among the branches of the fir trees, and there they disport  themselves gaily, climbing nimbly, and assisting their movements, as  parrots do, with their beaks. They will hang downward for minutes  clinging to a twig or cone, seeming to enjoy this apparently  uncomfortable position. They fly rapidly, but never to a great distance.  \"The pleasure they experience in the society of their mates is often  displayed by fluttering over the tops of the trees as they sing, after  which they hover for a time, and then sink slowly to their perch. In the  day time they are generally in motion, with the exception of a short  time at noon. During the spring, summer and autumn they pass their time  in flying from one plantation to another.\"    The Crossbill troubles itself but little about the other inhabitants of  the woods, and is said to be almost fearless of man. Should the male  lose his mate, he will remain sorrowfully perched upon the branch from  which his little companion has fallen; again and again visit the spot in  the hope of finding her; indeed it is only after repeated proofs that  she will never return that he begins to show any symptoms of shyness.    In feeding the Crossbill perches upon a cone with its head downwards, or  lays the cone upon a branch and stands upon it, holding it fast with his  sharp, strong pointed claws. Sometimes it will bite off a cone and carry  it to a neighboring bough, or to another tree where it can be opened,  for a suitable spot is not to be found on every branch.    The nest is formed of pine twigs, lined with feathers, soft grass, and  the needle-like leaves of the fir tree. Three or four eggs of a grayish  or bluish white color, streaked with faint blood red, reddish brown, or  bluish brown spots, are generally laid.    The following poem is quite a favorite among bird lovers, and is one of  those quaint legends that will never die.                      THE LEGEND OF THE CROSSBILL.        From the German of Julius Mosen, by Longfellow.        On the cross the dying Saviour        Heavenward lifts his eyelids calm,      Feels, but scarcely feels, a trembling        In his pierced and bleeding palm.        And by all the world forsaken,        Sees he how with zealous care      At the ruthless nail of iron        A little bird is striving there.        Stained with blood and never tiring,        With its beak it doth not cease,      From the cross it would free the Saviour,        Its Creator's son release.        And the Saviour speaks in mildness:        \"Blest be thou of all the good!      Bear, as token of this moment,        Marks of blood and holy rood!\"        And that bird is called the Crossbill,        Covered all with blood so clear,      In the groves of pine it singeth,        Songs, like legends, strange to hear.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  AMERICAN RED CROSSBILL.]          BIRD DAY IN THE SCHOOLS.      Bird Day! Have you heard of it? Whether you have or not, we wish to  assure you that it is worthy the thoughtful consideration of all  teachers, and of all others interested in protecting and preserving our  sweet birds.    Bird day has already proved a great success in two cities of the United  States, both in the enthusiasm shown by the children in their friendly  study of birds and in the result of such study.    In 1894, Oil City, Pa., observed the day, and in 1896 it was celebrated  in the schools of Fort Madison, Iowa.    Of the results in his schools, Supt. Babcock, of Oil City, says, \"There  has been a complete change in the relations existing between the small  boy and the birds.\"    Although we in Fort Madison have been engaged in bird study less than a  year, and have observed but one BIRD DAY, results similar to those  secured by Supt. Babcock are becoming manifest. Only a few days ago a  boy said to his teacher, \"I used to take pleasure in killing all kinds  of birds. Now I don't wish to harm even an English Sparrow.\"    The object of BIRD DAY and the study that leads to it, is to diffuse a  true knowledge of the aesthetic and practical value of birds and to  arouse an interest in bird protection.    And it is high time that something be done. From all over the country  come reports of a decrease in native birds. In many places some of our  sweetest songsters and most useful insect destroyers have become very  scarce or have disappeared entirely. The causes are many, but the  greatest is an inexcusable thoughtlessness on the part of young and old  of both sexes. Johnny teases for a gun. His fond parents get it for him.  Result--Johnny shows his marksmanship by shooting several birds in his  vicinity. Or, perhaps, the ladies need new hats. Nothing except birds  for trimming will do, though ten thousand sweet songs be hushed forever.    The study of bird life is one of especial interest to children and if  properly pursued will develop in them sympathetic characters that should  make them kinder towards their playmates now and towards their  fellow-men in the coming years.    Impress upon a child that        \"He liveth best who loveth best       All things, both great and small,\"    and you have built into his life something that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25887"],[0,"Lola; Or, The Thought and Speech of Animals (#3)"],[1,"brought him well-merited praise from a large  circle of acquaintances. So excellently did he acquit himself on this  occasion that I should like to place it on record.      \"REPORT OF THE PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF THE SPELLING DOG ROLF    \"_By Professor H. F. Ziegler_    \"In order to collect subscriptions for the benefit of the Central  Committee of War Charities, as also for the Society responsible for the  dogs for Army Medical Service, Frau Dr. Moekel kindly consented to  introduce her dog Rolf to the general public for the first time.    \"The performance took place in the Hall of the Casino at Mannheim, on  the 11th of May, 1914. Every seat in the Hall was taken.    \"Professor Kraemer of Hohenheim opened the meeting; he dwelt on the  usefulness of these dogs--trained to perform tasks in which their  intelligence accounted for no small part. He alluded to the scientific  importance of the new method of instruction by means of spelling--a  method first brought forward in connexion with the 'Thinking Horses'  belonging to Messrs. von Osten and K. Krall, and which had revealed  hitherto unexpected aspects of the animal soul.    \"He further pointed out the total absence of any intentional or  unintentional signalling, an objection which has already been  sufficiently disproved by the many singular and entirely spontaneous  communications constantly made on such occasions. Finally, he  emphasized that the investigations Frau Dr. Moekel had made with her  dog had proved to be of immense value as contributions towards the  study of animal psychology, being, in fact, of great scientific  service.    \"Frau Dr. Moekel was then wheeled on to the platform in her bath-chair,  and Rolf seated himself by her side.    \"In the first place a number of sums were set the dog which had been  called out by the audience; they were as follows: (4 x 7 - 13) / 3 = 5,  2 x 10 / 4 = 5, 8 x 9 / 12 = 6.    \"When the problem [3rt]27 was given Rolf proclaimed the correct number  '3,'--he immediately followed this, however, by spelling out: 'nid  wurdsl' ('no more roots'), implying that he declined anything further  to do with that form of reckoning; he had indeed, objected to 'roots'  for some time past! He next proceeded to name the various persons he  recognized in the assembly--the first being, 'dand, speisl basl' (Frau  Dr. Speiser, aus Basel); 'glein' (a Herr Klein, whom he had not seen  for two years); further, 'ogl lsr' (Herr Landsgerichtsrat Leser). When,  however, he was asked by a gentleman sitting in the front row whether  he knew him (the gentleman in question had sent him notes from time to  time), he replied: 'lol nid wisn' (Lol doesn't know). (N.B. Rolf is in  the habit of referring to himself as 'Lol.')    \"In order to subject him to an unexpected test I had brought with me a  box containing a 'may-bug' made of papier mache, the inside of which  was filled with biscuits. After Frau Dr. Moekel had retired from the  platform I opened my box and showed it to Rolf. He pushed his nose into  it, exhibiting marked interest and seemed impatient to communicate the  matter to his mistress, therefore without more ado he spelt out:  'maigfr in sagdl, inn was dsm sn' (i.e. 'Maikafer in der Schachtel;  innen was zu essen') (May-bug in box; inside something to eat), adding,  presumably as an after-thought, 'nid gefressn' (nicht gefressen; didn't  eat it!). Rolf had therefore recognised the biscuits inside the may-bug  by their smell only--and was anxious that she should know that they  hadn't been given him to eat! After this a gentleman in the audience  asked permission to put a secret test. The object selected was shown to  the dog in such a manner that his mistress had to turn aside so as not  to see it. But Rolf had become obstinate and refused to name the thing,  and he insisted on spelling out: 'nid, lol rgrd der wisd man': he  appeared to be 'geaergert' by the 'wueste man' (worried, or vexed by the  rough man)--and it may, indeed, have been that the dog sensed a certain  distrust of his mistress, or that, as is often the case with other  dogs, that he was reluctant to 'show off' at the request of an entire  stranger. Another time, should a similar trial be contemplated, it  would be wiser if the article to be named by the dog were--even if  handed up by the person desirous of making the test--shown him by  someone with whom he is familiar.[4]          [4] Frau Dr. Moekel told me that she again asked the dog on        the following day what the article shown him had been and he        answered: \"hd sdld bei arm grosfadr grab lib maibliml\" (Hat        gestehlt bei des armen Grossvaters Grab das liebe Maibluemchen)        (Had stolen from dear grandfather's grave the dear little        lilies-of-the-valley!). The object shown him had been a        lily-of-the-valley, and a few days before, Frau Moekel's        mother had told the children that she had taken all the        lilies-of-the-valley to their grandfather's grave. Rolf,        therefore, seemed to have conceived the idea that the flowers        shown him had been pilfered.--ZIEGLER.    \"Gradually Rolf became tired and rapped out: 'lol bd' (i.e. Rolf bett =  Rolf to bed). A pause was made during which some of Rolf's earlier  communications were made public. One was his reply as to why dogs do  not like cats;[5] this ran: 'lol imr hd dsorn wn sid kdsl, freigt fon  wgn graln. Lol hd lib sis dsi di nid dud grdsn lol, abr, andr hundl, di  nid gnn ir.' ( = Lol is always angry when he sees cats, perhaps on  account of their claws: Lol loves sweet Daisy, who doesn't scratch  Lol--but other dogs who do not know her.)          [5] The hatred of dogs for cats is hereditary; it is an instinct        common to all dogs, and, seeing that instinctive sensations do        not owe their origin to any deliberate act of reasoning, it is        generally difficult to account for them. It is therefore worth        drawing attention to the fact that Rolf did, nevertheless, make        an attempt at giving a reasonable reply.--ZIEGLER.    \"On 20 August, 1914, he rapped out a remark that referred to the war;  it had, of course, been difficult to explain the _nature_ of war to  him; the only way in which it seemed at all possible to bring this to  his understanding was by comparing it to the scuffling and quarrelling  of dogs--on which he observed: 'lol grn (i.e. gern = likes to) raufn,  mudr frbidn (i.e. Mutter verbieten = Mother forbids) abr franzos raufn  mit deidsn (i.e. Deutschen), mudr soln frbidn, (i.e. Mutter soll es  verbieten = Mother should forbid it), di nid dirfn (duerfen) raufe, is  ganz wirsd fon di ( = They should not be allowed to quarrel--it is very  rough of them!).    \"When the tests were resumed, Frau Dr. Moekel asked Rolf: 'What was it  the man called out in the street yesterday, when you were looking out  of the window?' and the dog spelt out: 'egsdrablad 5 hundrd franzos un  so weidr' ( = special edition 5 hundred French--and so on!). The  laughter elicited by this statement appeared to offend Rolf, for he  promptly spelt out the query: 'di lagn warum?' ( = They laugh--why?).    \"After this he applied himself to counting the flowers in a bouquet,  and he was asked to whom he would like to present it. He replied: \"lib  adolfin\" ( = dear Adolphine), thus distinguishing a particular lady who  was present--and he further added \"gomn\" (i.e. kommen = come), she had  therefore to step forward and receive the bouquet in person.    \"Little flags were distributed next, and Rolf was told to name the  country each stood for. For the yellow and black colours he spelt out:  \"esdeig\" (Austria), for the Turkish--'dirgig'; for the Baden flag:  \"baadin,\" while the Wuerttemberg colours he regarded as _German_! On  being shown the Bavarian flag he spelt: 'lib mudr sei fei farb!' (i.e.  die feine Farbe der lieben Mutter = the brave colours of dear  mother)--Frau Dr. Moekel being of Bavarian descent.    \"At the close of the meeting Rolf was told to name certain melodies,  and a gentleman present whistled the beginning of the song 'O,  Deutschland hoch in Ehren'--but the dog did not at once recognize the  song and spelt out--'nogmal!' (i.e. noch einmal = once more!). Then the  entire song was whistled to him and he spelt: 'heldons sdurm gbraus'  (i.e. Heldensturm-gebraus) and, as he liked to hear singing, he added:  'Wagd fon rein singe, bid' ( = Watch on the Rhine sing, please!). The  same gentleman then obliged him by whistling the 'Wacht am Rhein,' but  he was not quite content, for--as he subsequently observed, 'this was  not singing' (dis nid singt).    \"At the close of his tests Rolf was rewarded with a cake which he  promptly recognised as 'basllegrl' (Basler Leckerle = a Specialite of  Bale).    \"'The Heidelberger Zeitung' commented on the performance as follows:    \"'The astonishment of the audience increased with every moment, while  their delight and enthusiasm at the close of this remarkable and  interesting evening found vent in a storm of applause.'    \"Another journal, the 'Badische General Anzeige' wrote:    \"'The evening's performance must have converted many who before had  been sceptical.'\"                         *      *      *      *      *    Even as there are numerous horses capable of exercising similar  abilities, so too, is Rolf not a solitary example among dogs of his  kind to profit by instruction. Indeed, many of his descendants are  receiving tuition under the guidance of different instructors, and are  giving a good account of themselves.    I will here add Professor Ziegler's Report:      \"NEW REPORTS CONCERNING THE CALCULATING AND SPELLING DOG[6]    \"_By Professor Ziegler_    \"The descendants of the dog Rolf that have been trained by Frau Dr.  Moekel,[7] are now full grown, and several of them have acquitted  themselves with success. These are the bitch Ilse, the two males, Heinz  and Harras, and the bitch Lola, and I here purpose to set down the  latest information "]]]
