Certainly there was nothing accusatory in the other's bearing. His face  was frankness itself. In books criminals were always fearing that people  suspected them, reflected Steve. The man knew nothing about him at all.  It was absurd to think he did.    Nevertheless the boy was eager to be gone from the presence of those  searching blue eyes and therefore he climbed into his car, murmuring  hurriedly:    \"You've been corking to help me out!\"    The workman held up a protesting hand.    \"Don't think of it again,\" he answered. \"I was glad to do it. Good luck  to you!\"    With nervous hands Stephen started the engine and, backing the  automobile about, headed it homeward. Now that danger was past his  desire to reach Coventry before his father should arrive drove every  other thought from his mind, and soon the mysterious hero of the brown  jumper was forgotten. Although he made wonderfully good time back over  the road it seemed hours before he turned in at his own gate and brought  the throbbing motor to rest in the garage. A sigh of thankfulness  welled up within him. The great red leviathan that had caused him such  anguish of spirit stood there in the stillness as peacefully as if it  had never stirred from the spot it occupied. If only it had remained  there, how glad the boy would have been.    He ventured to look toward the windows fronting the avenue. No one was  in sight, it was true; but to flatter himself that he had been  unobserved was ridiculous for he saw by the clock that his father,  mother, and Doris must already have reached home. Doubtless they were in  the house now and fully acquainted with what he had done. If they had  not missed the car from the garage they would at least have seen it  whirl into the driveway with him at the wheel. Any moment his father  might appear at his shoulder. To delay was useless. He had had his fun  and now in manly fashion he must face the music and pay for it. How he  dreaded the coming storm!    Once, twice he braced himself, then moved reluctantly toward the house,  climbed the steps, and let himself in at the front door. He could hardly  expect any one would come to greet him under the circumstances. An  ominous silence pervaded the great dim hall but after the glare of the  white ribbon of road on which his eyes had been so intently fixed he  found the darkness cool and tranquilizing. At first he could scarcely  see; then as he gradually became accustomed to the faint light he espied  on the silver card tray a telegram addressed to himself and with a  quiver of apprehension tore it open. Telegrams were not such a common  occurrence in his life that he had ceased to regard them with misgiving.    The message on which his gaze rested, however, contained no ill tidings.  On the contrary it merely announced that the family had been detained in  New York longer than they had expected and would not return until noon  to-morrow. He would have almost another day, therefore, before he would  be forced to make confession to his father! The respite was a welcome  one and with it his tenseness relaxed. He even gained courage on the  strength of his steadier nerves to creep into the kitchen and confront  Mary, the cook, whom he knew must have seen him shoot into the driveway  and who, having been years in the home, would not hesitate to lecture  him roundly for his conduct. But Mary was not there and neither was  Julia, the waitress. In the absence of the head of the house the two had  evidently ascended to the third story there to forget in sleep the cares  of daily life. Stephen smiled at the discovery. It was a coincidence.  Unquestionably Fate was with him. It helped his self-respect to feel  that at least the servants were in ignorance of what he had done. Nobody  knew--nobody at all!    With an interval of rest and a dash of cold water upon his face  gradually the act he had committed began to sink back into normal  perspective and loom less gigantic in his memory. After all was it such  a dreadful thing, he asked himself. Of course he should not have done it  and he fully intended to confess his fault and accept the blame. But was  the folly so terrible? He owned that he regretted it and admitted that  he was somewhat troubled over the probable consequences, and every time  he awoke in the night a dread of the morrow came upon him. In the  morning he rushed off to school, found the team had won the game, and  came home feeling even more justified than before. Why, if he had not  taken the car, the school might have forfeited that victory!    All the afternoon as he sat quietly at his books he tried to keep this  consideration uppermost in his mind. Then at dinner time there was a  stir in the hall and he knew the moment he feared had arrived. The  family were back again! Slowly he stole down over the heavily carpeted  stairs. Yes, there they were, just coming in at the door, laughing and  chatting gaily with Julia, who had let them in. The next instant his  mother had espied him on the landing and had called a greeting.    There was a smile on her face that reproached him for having yielded to  the temptation to deceive her even for a second.    \"Such a delightful trip as we have had, Steve!\" she called. \"We wished a  dozen times that you were with us. But some vacation you shall have a  holiday in New York with your father to pay for what you have missed  this time. You shall not be cheated out of all the fun, dear boy!\"    \"Everything been all right here, son?\" inquired his father from the foot  of the stairs.    \"Yes, Dad.\"    \"Havens has not showed up yet, I suppose.\"    The boy flushed.    \"No, sir.\"    \"It seems to take him an interminable time to have his tonsils out. If  he does not appear pretty soon I shall have to get another man to run  the car. We can't be left high and dry like this,\" fretted the elder man  irritably. \"Suppose I knew nothing about it, where would we be? I wished  to-day you were old enough to have a license and could have come to the  station to meet us. I believe with a little more instruction you could  manage that automobile all right. Not that I should let you go racing  over the country with a lot of boys. But you might be very useful in  taking your mother and sister about and helping when we were in a fix  like this. I think you would enjoy doing it, too.\"    \"I--I'm--sure I should,\" replied the lad, avoiding his father's eye and  studying the toe of his shoe intently. It passed through his mind as he  stood there that now was the moment for confession. He had only to say,    \"_I had the car out yesterday_,\" and the dreaded ordeal would be over.  But somehow he could not utter the words. Instead he descended from the  landing and followed the others into the library where the conversation  immediately shifted to other topics. In the jumble of narrative his  chance to speak was swallowed up nor during the next few days did any  suitable opportunity occur for him to make his belated confession. When  Mr. Tolman was not at meetings of the railroad board he was at his  office or occupied with important affairs, and by and by so many events  had intervened that to go back into the past seemed to Stephen idle  sentimentality. At length he had lulled his conscience into deciding  that in view of the conditions it was quite unnecessary to acquaint his  father and mother with his wrong-doing at all. He was safely out of the  entanglement and was it not just as well to accept his escape with  gratitude and let sleeping dogs lie? All the punishments in the world  could not change anything now. What would be the use of telling?          CHAPTER II    A MEETING WITH AN OLD FRIEND      The day of the excursion to Northampton was one of those clear mornings  when a light frost turned the maples to vermilion and in a single night  transformed the ripening summer foliage to the splendor of autumn. The  Tolman family were in the highest spirits; it was not often that Mr.  Tolman could be persuaded to leave his business and steal away for a  week-end and when he did it was always a cause for great rejoicing.  Doris, elated at the prospect of rejoining her college friends, was also  in the happiest frame of mind and tripped up and down stairs, collecting  her forgotten possessions and jamming them into her already bulging  suitcase.    As for Steve, the prickings of conscience that had at first tormented  him and made him shrink from being left alone with his father had quite  vanished. He had argued himself into a state of mental tranquility  where further punishment for his misdemeanor seemed superfluous. After  his hairbreadth escape from disaster there was no danger, he argued, of  his repeating the experiment, and was not this the very lesson all  punishments sought to instill? If he had achieved this result without  bothering his father about the details, why so much the better. Did not  the old adage say that \"experience is the best teacher\"? Certainly in  this case the maxim held true.    Having thus excused his under-handedness and stifled the protests of his  better nature he felt, or tried to feel, entirely at peace with the  world; and as he now sauntered out to greet the new day he did it as  jauntily as if he had nothing to conceal. Already the car was at the  door with the luggage aboard and its engine humming invitingly. As the  boy listened to the sound he could not but rejoice that the purring  monster could tell no tales. How disconcerting it would be should the  scarlet devil suddenly shout aloud: \"Well, Steve, don't you hope we do  not get stalled to-day the way we did going to Torrington?\" Mercifully  there was no danger of that. The engine might puff and purr and snort  but at least it could not talk, and his secret was quite safe. This  reflection lighted his face with courage and when the family came out to  join him no one would have suspected that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#3)"],[1,"t. His object was to catch  the sun before he rose. He fixed his snare firmly on a spot just where  the sun must strike the land as it rose above the earth; and sure  enough, he caught the sun, so that it was held fast in the cord and did  not rise.    The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great  commotion. They had no light; and they ran to and fro, calling out to  each other, and inquiring what had happened. They summoned a council to  debate upon the matter, and an old dormouse, suspecting where the  trouble lay, proposed that some one should be appointed to go and cut  the cord. This was a bold thing to undertake, as the rays of the sun  could not fail to burn whoever should venture so near to them.    At last the venerable dormouse himself undertook it, for the very good  reason that no one else would. At this time the dormouse was the largest  animal in the world. When he stood up he looked like a mountain. It  made haste to the place where the sun lay ensnared, and as it came  nearer and nearer, its back began to smoke and burn with the heat, and  the whole top of his huge bulk was turned in a very short time to  enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with  its teeth and freeing the sun, which rolled up again, as round and  beautiful as ever, into the wide blue sky. But the dormouse--or blind  woman as it is called--was shrunk away to a very small size; and that is  the reason why it is now one of the tiniest creatures upon the earth.    The little boy returned home when he discovered that the sun had escaped  his snare, and devoted himself entirely to hunting. \"If the beautiful  hair of my sister would not hold the sun fast, nothing in the world  could,\" he said. \"He was not born, a little fellow like himself, to look  after the sun. It required one greater and wiser than he was to regulate  that.\" And he went out and shot ten more snow-birds; for in this  business he was very expert; and he had a new bird-skin coat made, which  was prettier than the one he had worn before.          III.    STRONG DESIRE, AND THE RED SORCERER.      There was a man called Odshedoph, or the Child of Strong Desires, who  had a wife and one son. He had withdrawn his family from the village,  where they had spent the winter, to the neighborhood of a distant  forest, where game abounded. This wood was a day's travel from his  winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while  the husband went out to hunt. Early in the evening he returned with a  deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called  Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. The son replied that  it was dark, and he was afraid. His father still urged him, saying that  his mother, as well as himself, was tired, and the distance to the water  very short. But no persuasion could overcome the young man's reluctance.  He refused to go.    \"Ah, my son,\" said the father, at last, \"if you are afraid to go to the  river, you will never kill the Red Head.\"    The stripling was deeply vexed by this observation; it seemed to touch  him to the very quick. He mused in silence. He refused to eat, and made  no reply when spoken to. He sat by the lodge door all the night through,  looking up at the stars, and sighing like one sorely distressed.    The next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer, and to  make it into moccasins for him, while he busied himself in preparing a  bow and arrows.    As soon as these were in readiness, he left the lodge one morning, at  sunrise, without saying a word to his father or mother. As he passed  along, he fired one of his arrows into the air, which fell westward. He  took that course, and coming to the spot where the arrow had fallen, he  was rejoiced to find it piercing the heart of a deer. He refreshed  himself with a meal of the venison, and the next morning he fired  another arrow. Following its course, after traveling all day he found  that he had transfixed another deer. In this manner he fired four  arrows, and every evening he discovered that he had killed a deer.    By a strange oversight, he left the arrows sticking in the carcasses,  and passed on without withdrawing them. Having in this way no arrow for  the fifth day, he was in great distress at night for the want of food.    At last he threw himself upon the earth in despair, concluding that he  might as well perish there as go further. But he had not lain long  before he heard a hollow rumbling noise, in the ground beneath him, like  that of an earthquake moving slowly along.    He sprang up, and discovered at a distance the figure of a human being,  walking with a stick. He looked attentively, and saw that the figure was  walking in a wide beaten path in a prairie, leading from a dusky lodge  to a lake, whose waters were black and turbid.    To his surprise, this lodge, which had not been in view when he cast  himself upon the ground, was now near at hand. He approached a little  nearer, and concealed himself; and in a moment he discovered that the  figure was no other than that of the terrible witch, the little old  woman who makes war. Her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and  solid, and the noise Strong Desire had heard was caused by the striking  of her walking staff upon the ground. The top of this staff was  decorated with a string of the toes and bills of birds of every kind,  who, at every stroke of the stick, fluttered and sung their various  notes in concert.    She entered her lodge and laid off her mantle, which was entirely  composed of the scalps of women. Before folding it, she shook it  several times, and at every shake the scalps uttered loud shouts of  laughter, in which the old hag joined. The boy, who lingered at the  door, was greatly alarmed, but he uttered no cry.    After laying by the cloak, she came directly to him. Looking at him  steadily, she informed him that she had known him from the time he had  left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements. She told him not  to fear or despair, for she would be his protector and friend. She  invited him into her lodge, and gave him a supper. During the repast,  she questioned him as to his motives for visiting her. He related his  history, stated the manner in which he had been disgraced, and the  difficulties he labored under.    \"Now tell me truly,\" said the little old woman who makes war, \"you were  afraid to go to the water in the dark.\"    \"I was,\" Strong Desire answered, promptly.    As he replied, the hag waved her staff. The birds set up a clamorous  cry, and the mantle shook violently as all the scalps burst into a  hideous shout of laughter.    \"And are you afraid now,\" she asked again.    \"I am,\" again answered Strong Desire, without hesitation.    \"But you are not afraid to speak the truth,\" rejoined the little old  woman. \"You will be a brave man yet.\"    She cheered him with the assurance of her friendship, and began at once  to exercise her power upon him. His hair being very short, she took a  great leaden comb, and after drawing it through his locks several times,  they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman.  She then proceeded to dress him as a female, furnishing him with the  necessary garments, and tinting his face with colors of the most  charming dye. She gave him, too, a bowl of shining metal. She directed  him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword-grass, and to proceed  the next morning to the banks of the lake, which was no other than that  over which the Red Head reigned. Now Hah-Undo-Tah, or the Red Head, was  a most powerful sorcerer, living upon an island in the centre of his  realm of water, and he was the terror of all the country. She informed  him that there would be many Indians upon the island, who, as soon as  they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with, would come and solicit  him to be their wife, and to take him over to the island. These offers  he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the  wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for  himself, she would return to her village. She said, that as soon as the  Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which  she must embark.    \"On reaching the shore,\" added the little old woman, \"you must consent  to be his wife; and in the evening you are to induce him to take a walk  out of the village, and when you have reached a lonesome spot, use the  first opportunity to cut off his head with the blade of grass.\"    She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself  to sustain his assumed character of a woman. His fear would scarcely  permit him to consent to engage in an adventure attended with so much  danger; but the recollection of his father's looks and reproaches of the  want of courage, decided him.    Early in the morning he left the lodge of the little old woman who makes  war, which was clouded in a heavy brackish fog, so thick and heavy to  breathe, that he with difficulty made his way forth. When he turned to  look back for it, it was gone.    He took the hard beaten path to the banks of the lake, and made for the  water at a point directly opposite the Red Head's lodge.    Where he now stood it was beautiful day. The heavens were clear, and the  sun shone out as brightly to Strong Desire as on the first morning when  he had put forth his little head from the door of his father's lodge. He  had not been long there, sauntering along the beach, when he displayed  the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake. Very soon a number  of canoes came off from the island. The men admired his dress, and were  charmed with his beauty, and almost with one voice they all made  proposals of marriage. These, Strong Desire promptly declined.    When this was reported to Red Head, he ordered his royal bark to be  launched by his chosen men of the oar, and crossed over to see"]]]
