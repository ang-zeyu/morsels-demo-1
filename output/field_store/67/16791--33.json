Something in his aspect  awed the warrior, who feared to address him.  He returned to the house,  and said to Dekanawidah, \"a man, or a figure like a man, is seated by the  spring, having his breast covered with strings of white shells.\"  \"It is  a guest,\" replied the chief; \"go and bring him in.  We will make him  welcome.\"  Thus Hiawatha and Dekanawidah first met.  They found in each  other kindred spirits.  The sagacity of the Mohawk chief grasped at once  the advantages of the proposed plan, and the two worked together in  perfecting it, and in commending it to the people.  After much discussion  in council, the adhesion of the Mohawk nation was secured.  Dekanawidah  then despatched two of his brothers as ambassadors to the nearest tribe,  the Oneidas, to lay the project before them.  The Oneida nation is deemed  to be a comparatively recent offshoot from the Mohawks.  The difference  of language is slight, showing that their separation was much later than  that of the Onondagas.  In the figurative speech of the Iroquois, the  Oneida is the son, and the Onondaga is the brother, of the Mohawk.  Dekanawidah had good reason to expect that it would not prove difficult  to win the consent of the Oneidas to the proposed scheme.  But delay and  deliberation mark all public acts of the Indians.  The ambassadors found  the leading chief, Odatshehte, at his town on the Oneida creek.  He  received their message in a friendly way, but required time for his  people to consider it in council.  \"Come back in another day,\" he said to  the messengers.  In the political speech of the Indians, a day is  understood to mean a year.  The envoys carried back the reply to  Dekanawidah and Hiawatha, who knew that they could do nothing but wait  the prescribed time.  After the lapse of a year, they repaired to the  place of meeting.  The treaty which initiated the great league was then  and there ratified between the representatives of the Mohawk and Oneida  nations.  The name of Odatshehte means \"the quiver-bearer;\" and as  Atotarho, \"the entangled,\" is fabled to have had his head wreathed with  snaky locks, and as Hiawatha, \"the wampum-seeker,\" is represented to have  wrought shells into wampum, so the Oneida chief is reputed to have  appeared at this treaty bearing at his shoulder a quiver full of arrows.    The Onondagas lay next to the Oneidas.  To them, or rather to their  terrible chief, the next application was made.  The first meeting of  Atotarho and Dekanawidah is a notable event in Iroquois history.  At a  later day, a native artist sought to represent it in an historical  picture, which has been already referred to.  Atotarho is seated in  solitary and surly dignity, smoking a long pipe, his head and body  encircled with contorted and angry serpents.  Standing before him are two  figures which cannot be mistaken.  The foremost, a plumed and cinctured  warrior, depicted as addressing the Onondaga chief, holds in his right  hand, as a staff, his flint-headed spear,--the ensign which marks him as  the representative of the Kanienga, or \"People of the Flint,\"--for so the  Mohawks style themselves.  Behind him another plumed figure bears in his  hand a bow with arrows, and at his shoulder a quiver.  Divested of its  mythological embellishments, the picture rudely represents the interview  which actually took place.  The immediate result was unpromising.  The  Onondaga chief coldly refused to entertain the project, which he had  already rejected when proposed by Hiawatha.  The ambassadors were not  discouraged.  Beyond the Onondagas were scattered the villages of the  Cayugas, a people described by the Jesuit missionaries, at a later day,  as the most mild and tractable of the Iroquois.  They were considered an  offshoot of the Onondagas, to whom they bore the same filial relation  which the Oneidas bore to the Mohawks.  The journey of the advocates of  peace through the forest to the Cayuga capital, and their reception, are  minutely detailed in the traditionary narrative.  The Cayugas, who had  suffered from the prowess and cruelty of the Onondaga chief, needed  little persuasion.  They readily consented to come into the league, and  their chief, Akahenyonk, \"the wary spy,\" joined the Mohawk and Oneida  representatives in a new embassy to the Onondagas.  Acting probably upon  the advice of Hiawatha, who knew better than any other the character of  the community and the chief with whom they had to deal, they made  proposals highly flattering to the self-esteem which was the most notable  trait of both ruler and people.  The Onondagas should be the leading  nation of the confederacy.  Their chief town should be the federal  capital, where the great councils of the league should be held, and where  its records should be preserved.  The nation should be represented in the  council by fourteen senators, while no other nation should have more than  ten.  And as the Onondagas should be the leading tribe, so Atotarho  should be the leading chief.  He alone should have the right of summoning  the federal council, and no act of the council to which he objected  should be valid.  In other words, an absolute veto was given to him.  To  enhance his personal dignity two high chiefs were appointed as his  special aids and counsellors, his \"secretaries of state,\" so to speak.  Other insignia of preeminence were to be possessed by him; and, in view  of all these distinctions, it is not surprising that his successor, who,  two centuries later, retained the same prerogatives, should have been  occasionally styled by the English colonists \"the emperor of the Five  Nations.\"  It might seem, indeed, at first thought, that the founders of  the confederacy had voluntarily placed themselves and their tribes in a  position of almost abject subserviency to Atotarho and his followers.  But they knew too well the qualities of their people to fear for them any  political subjection.  It was certain that when once the league was  established, and its representatives had met in council, character and  intelligence would assume their natural sway, and mere artificial rank  and dignity would be little regarded.  Atotarho and his people, however,  yielded either to these specious offers or to the pressure which the  combined urgency of the three allied nations now brought to bear upon  them.  They finally accepted the league; and the great chief, who had  originally opposed it, now naturally became eager to see it as widely  extended as possible.  He advised its representatives to go on at once to  the westward, and enlist the populous Seneca towns, pointing out how this  might best be done.  This advice was followed, and the adhesion of the  Senecas was secured by giving to their two leading chiefs, Kanyadariyo  (\"beautiful lake\") and Shadekaronyes (\"the equal skies\"), the offices of  military commanders of the confederacy, with the title of door-keepers of  the \"Long-House,\"--that being the figure by which the league was known.    The six national leaders who have been mentioned--Dekanawidah for the  Mohawks, Odatshehte for the Oneidas, Atotarho for the Onondagas,  Akahenyonk for the Cayugas, Kanyadariyo and Shadekaronyes for the two  great divisions of the Senecas--met in convention near the Onondaga Lake,  with Hiawatha for their adviser, and a vast concourse of their followers,  to settle the terms and rules of their confederacy, and to nominate its  first council.  Of this council, nine members (or ten, if Dekanawidah be  included) were assigned to the Mohawks, a like number to the Oneidas,  fourteen to the lordly Onondagas, ten to the Cayugas, and eight to the  Senecas.  Except in the way of compliment, the number assigned to each  nation was really of little consequence, inasmuch as, by the rule of the  league, unanimity was exacted in all their decisions.  This unanimity,  however, did not require the suffrage of every member of the council.  The representatives of each nation first deliberated apart upon the  question proposed.  In this separate council the majority decided; and  the leading chief then expressed in the great council the voice of his  nation.  Thus the veto of Atotarho ceased at once to be peculiar to him,  and became a right exercised by each of the allied nations.  This  requirement of unanimity, embarrassing as it might seem, did not prove to  be so in practice.  Whenever a question arose on which opinions were  divided, its decision was either postponed, or some compromise was  reached which left all parties contented.    The first members of the council were appointed by the convention,--under  what precise rule is unknown; but their successors came in by a method in  which the hereditary and the elective systems were singularly combined,  and in which female suffrage had an important place.  When a chief died  or (as sometimes happened) was deposed for incapacity or misconduct, some  member of the same family succeeded him.  Rank followed the female line;  and this successor might be any descendant of the late chief's mother or  grandmother,--his brother, his cousin or his nephew,--but never his son.  Among many persons who might thus be eligible, the selection was made in  the first instance by a family council.  In this council the \"chief  matron\" of the family, a noble dame whose position and right were well  defined, had the deciding voice.  This remarkable fact is affirmed by the  Jesuit missionary Lafitau, and the usage remains in full vigor among the  Canadian Iroquois to this day.  If there are two or more members of the  family who seem to have equal claims, the nominating matron sometimes  declines to decide between them, and names them both or all, leaving the  ultimate choice to the nation or the federal council.  The council of the  nation next considers the nomination, and if dissatisfied, refers it back  to the family for a new designation.

When it was explained  to him that in England the term _uncut_ signified only that the edges  were not _trimmed_, he shelved the rarity with the remark that he  'learned something every day.' . . . Perhaps the Caxton Club of  Chicago is wise in describing its productions as 'with edges  untrimmed.' Even a Philistine ought to be able to comprehend that  description, although I once knew a man who supposed that a book  'bound in boards' had sides composed of planking.\"    Dr. Ferriar's satirical lines in his _Second Maxim_ will find  sympathizers among admirers of uncuts:--        Who, with fantastic pruning-hook,      Dresses the borders of his book,      Merely to ornament its look--          Amongst philosophers a fop is:      What if, perchance, he thence discover      Facilities in turning over,      The virtuoso is a lover          Of coyer charms in \"uncut copies.\"    I have been requested to \"explain the reason, if there be any, for  leaving leaf-edges fastened [unopened]--even in evanescent  magazines--and why people keep books in this condition, without  looking at the contents.\" The reason why the binder does not open all  the leaves is that it involves additional labor and expense which the  publisher usually does not care to incur, as it does not essentially  add to the selling value. Indeed, some collectors hesitate to open the  leaves of their books with the paper-knife, for fear that the selling  price would be thereby depreciated. This is an entirely mistaken idea,  though it prevails very generally among those who do not understand  the real meaning of the term \"uncut.\" Most booksellers prefer having  the leaves of the volumes all opened, as many buyers and readers  object to the nuisance of cutting them open. Some of the magazine  publishers have modern folding machines equipped with blades for  severing all the leaves. In fine book-making, however, most of the  folding and cutting is done by hand.    The third \"symptom\" defined by Dibdin, viz: \"extra-illustrating,\"  commonly called _grangerizing_, is really so far removed from the  indicative stages of bibliomania as to render it entirely  inappropriate as a proper single characteristic; it is the whole  disease in its worst form. Fortunately, it is not a frequent infirmity  among our present day bibliomaniacs. I cannot refrain from quoting Mr.  William P. Cutter's vehement denunciation of the class of literary  foragers who are thus affected. He observes that \"this craze for  'extra-illustrating' seizes remorselessly the previously harmless  bibliophile, and leads him to become a wicked despoiler and mutilator  of books. The extra-illustrator is nearly always the person  responsible for the decrepit condition of many of the books which  'unfortunately lack the rare portrait,' or have, 'as usual,' some  valuable plate or map lacking. Were this professional despoiler, or  his minions, the ruthless booksellers, to destroy the sad wrecks which  result from their piratical depredations, all would be well. But they  set these poor maimed hulks adrift again, to seek salvage from some  deluded collector, or some impoverished or ignorant librarian.    \"It is curious that the very volume in which our reverend friend  Dibdin so heartily condemns these inexcusable bandits, should be  seized on as a receptacle for their ill-gotten prizes. May the spectre  of Thomas Frognall Dibdin haunt the souls of these impious rascals,  and torture them with never-ceasing visions of unobtainable and rare  portraits, non-existent autographs, and elusive engravings in general!  They even dare to profane your sacred work, the _Biblia_ of  book-lovers, by the 'insertion' of crudities invented by their  fiendish imagination. They have committed the 'unpardonable sin' of  bibliophilism. Not only do they carry on this wicked work, but  actually flaunt their base crimes in the face of their innocent  brethren. Hearken to this:--    \"DIBDIN, T.F. _Bibliomania._ London, 1811. Extended to five volumes,  with extra printed titles, and having eight hundred engravings  inserted, comprising views, old titles(!), vignettes, and six hundred  and seventy-five portraits of authors, actors, poets, sovereigns,  artists, prelates, &c., &c., 250 guineas.\"    Limited space prevents me from making any remarks upon the other five  \"symptoms,\" none of which are of any special interest, except to  collectors to whose eccentricities they particularly relate.    As to \"Autograph Editions,\" the craze for these continues without  abatement. To me, this has always been one of the unsolved mysteries  of the book-mania. I can readily appreciate how a collector would  prize an author's inscribed copy of some choice edition, but why  intelligent people should be allured into the belief that an author's  stereotyped autograph displayed upon a front page gives any added  value to a set of subscription books, will to me, I fear, forever  remain a disentangled enigma. I was once applied to by an agent  representing a $6000 \"Autograph Edition\" of Jean Jacques Rousseau.  Having never seen Rousseau's autograph, I asked that it be shown me.  \"Oh,\" said the agent, \"Rousseau himself don't sign the copies, but the  set will be signed by the publishers.\" Would not a much less expensive  and more expeditious way of obtaining publishers' autographs be found  in writing a postal card of inquiry for the \"prices and terms\" on  their publications?    Gilpin has left the following quaint account of the eccentric old  bibliomaniac, Henry Hastings, the uncompanionable neighbor of Anthony  Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury. The accompanying pen-and-ink sketch  represents Louis Maynelle's idealization of this interesting  character; it was made especially for this volume:--    \"Mr. Hastings was low of stature, but strong and active, of a ruddy  complexion, with flaxen hair. His clothes were always of green cloth.  His house was of the old fashion; in the midst of a large park, well  stocked with deer, rabbits, and fish-ponds. He had a long narrow  bowling green in it, and used to play with round sand bowls. Here too  he had a banqueting room built, like a stand in a large tree.    [Illustration]    \"He kept all sorts of hounds that ran buck, fox, hare, otter, and  badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both long and short winged. His  great hall was commonly strewed with marrow-bones, and full of  hawk-perches, hounds, spaniels, and terriers. The upper end of it was  hung with fox-skins of this and the last year's killing. Here and  there a polecat was intermixed and hunter's poles in great abundance.  The parlour was a large room, completely furnished in the same style.  On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some of the choicest  terriers, hounds and spaniels. One or two of the great chairs had  litters of cats in them, which were not to be disturbed. Of these,  three or four always attended him at dinner, and a little white wand  lay by his trencher, to defend it if they were too troublesome. In the  windows, which were very large, lay his arrows, cross-bows, and other  accoutrements. The corners of the room were filled with his best  hunting and hawking poles. His oyster table stood at the lower end of  the room, which was in constant use twice a day, all the year round;  for he never failed to eat oysters both at dinner and supper, with  which the neighbouring town of Pool supplied him.    \"At the upper end of the room stood a small table with a double desk,  one side of which held a church Bible; the other the _Book of  Martyrs_. On different tables in the room lay hawks' hoods, bells, old  hats with their crowns thrust in, full of pheasant eggs, tables, dice,  cards, and store of tobacco pipes. At one end of this room was a door,  which opened into a closet, where stood bottles of strong beer and  wine, which never came out but in single glasses, which was the rule  of the house, for he never exceeded himself nor permitted others to  exceed.    \"Answering to this closet was a door into an old chapel, which had  been long disused for devotion; but in the pulpit, as the safest  place, was always to be found a cold chine of beef, a venison pasty, a  gammon of bacon, or a great apple-pye, with thick crust, well baked.  His table cost him not much, though it was good to eat at. His sports  supplied all but beef and mutton, except on Fridays, when he had the  best of fish. He never wanted a London pudding, and he always sang it  in with 'My part lies therein-a.' He drank a glass or two of wine at  meals; put syrup of gilly-flowers into his sack, and had always a tun  glass of small beer standing by him, which he often stirred about with  rosemary. He lived to be an hundred, and never lost his eyesight, nor  used spectacles. He got on horseback without help, and rode to the  death of the stag till he was past four-score.\"    It is said of George Steevens, the famous Shakespearian collector,  that he \"lived in a retired and eligibly situated house, just on the  rise of Hampstead Heath. It was paled in, and had immediately before  it a verdant lawn skirted with a variety of picturesque trees. Here  Steevens lived, embosomed in books, shrubs and trees, being either too  coy or too unsociable to mingle with his neighbours. His habits were  indeed peculiar: not much to be envied or imitated, as they sometimes  betrayed the flights of a madman and sometimes the asperities of a  cynic. His attachments were warm but fickle both in choice and  duration. He would frequently part from one with whom he had lived on  terms of close intimacy, without any assignable cause, and his  enmities once fixed were immovable. There was indeed a kind of venom  in his antipathies, nor would he suffer his ears to be assailed or his  heart to relent in favour of those against whom he entertained  animosities, however capricious and unfounded. In one pursuit only was  he consistent: one object only did he woo with "]]]
