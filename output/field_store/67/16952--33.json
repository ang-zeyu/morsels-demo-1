[Music]      Let the Females attend,  To the Lines which are penn'd,    For here I shall give a Relation;  Of a Young marry'd Wife,  Who did venture her Life,    For a Soldier, a Soldier she went from the Nation.    She her Husband did leave,  And did likewise receive    Her Arms, and on Board she did enter;  And right valiantly went,  With a Resolution bent,    To the Ocean, the Ocean her Life there to venture.    Yet of all the Ships Crew,  Not a Seaman that knew,    They then had a Woman so near 'em;  On the Ocean so deep,  She her Council did keep,    Ay, and therefore, and therefore she never did fear 'em.    She was valiant and bold,  And would not be controul'd,    By any that dare to offend her;  If a Quarrel arose,  She would give him dry Blows,    And the Captain, the Captain did highly commend her.    For he took her to be,  Then of no mean Degree,    A Gentleman's Son or a 'Squire;  With a Hand white and fair,  There was none could compare,    Which the Captain, the Captain did often admire.    On the _Irish_ Shore,  Where the Cannons did roar,    With many stout Lads she was landed;  There her Life to expose,  She lost two of her Toes,    And in Battle, in Battle was daily commended.    Under _Grafton_ she fought,  Like a brave Hero stout,    And made the proud Tories retire;  She in Field did appear,  With a Heart void of Fear,    And she bravely, she bravely did charge and give fire.    While the battering Balls,  Did assault the strong Walls,    Of _Cork_ and the sweet Trumpets sounded;  She did bravely advance,  Where by unhappy Chance,    This young Female, young Female alass she was wounded.    At the End of the Fray,  Still she languishing lay,    Then over the Ocean they brought her;  To her own Native Shore,  Now they ne'er knew before,    That a Woman, a Woman had been in that Slaughter.    What she long had conceal'd,  Now at length she reveal'd,    That she was a Woman that ventur'd;  Then to _London_ with care,  She did straitways repair,    But she dy'd, oh she dy'd e'er the City she enter'd.    When her Parents beheld,  They with Sorrow was fill'd,    For why they did dearly adore her:  In her Grave now she lies,  'Tis not watery Eyes,    No nor Sighing, nor Sighing that e'er can restore her.          _A Medly, Compos'd out of several_ SONGS.

For I have neither robbed nor stole,    Nor have I done any injury;  But I have gotten a Fair Maid with Child,    The Minister's Daughter of bonny _Dundee_:  _Come fill up my Cup, come fill up my Can,_  _Come saddle my Horse and call up my Man,_    _Come open the Gates and let me go free,_    _And Ise gang no more to bonny_ Dundee.    Altho' Ise gotten her Maiden-head,    Geud feth Ise given her mine in lieu;  For when at her Daddy's Ise gang to Bed,    Ise mow'd her without any more to do?  Ise cuddle her close, and gave her a Kiss,  Pray tell now where is the harm of this,    _Then open the Gates and let me go free,_    _And Ise gang no more to bonny_ Dundee.    All _Scotland_ ne'er afforded a Lass,    So bonny and blith as _Jenny_ my dear;  Ise gave her a Gown of Green on the Grass,    But now Ise no longer must tarry here:  Then saddle my Nag that's bonny and gay,  For now it is time to gang hence away,    _Then open the Gates and let me go free,_    _She's ken me no more to bonny_ Dundee.    In Liberty still I reckon to Reign,    For why I have done no honest Man wrong;  The Parson may take his Daughter again,    For she'll be a Mammy before it is long:  And have a young Lad or Lass of my breed,  Ise think I have done her a generous deed;    _Then open the Gates and let me go free,_    _For Ise gang no more to bonny_ Dundee.

Do you not believe that this  question has a direct bearing upon the welfare of the families,  especially of the feminine part of them? Who suffers the most if the  father or husband spends the money of the family in order to satisfy  his craving for gambling? The women, of course, the daughters who  are often condemned to undergo unnecessary privations and suffering  because of the conduct of the head of the family. And you try to deny  to woman the right to take a part in political affairs, to enlighten  the electorate with regard to the fatal results of gambling or cast  her vote for the candidate who promises to secure the passage of  measures against it? And why should the opinion of woman on issues  like this not have as much weight as that of man? Should it not be  given greater weight, it being she who suffers the consequences and  results of the evil? There are many questions like this which vitally  affect the welfare and happiness of woman.    I fail to see anything pernicious in the activity of woman in the  field of politics: I even believe that her activity in this respect  will be highly salutary and beneficent not only for womankind, but  for society in general. It will serve to instruct woman and give her  a more extensive knowledge of the world and of life. She will not be  considered as an outsider where society and government are concerned  and will therefore not remain indifferent to their short-comings and  progress. Nothing could possibly be more harmful to society than the  presence in it of foreign bodies absolutely indifferent to its weal  or woe, of useless parts in the machinery of progress.    We are terrified by the idea that the impulsiveness of woman and her  fanaticism and narrow-mindedness, according to some, her weakness and  lack of character, according to others, and her unpreparedness and  deficient culture, according to still others, will make female suffrage  a mere farce and will convert it into a tool for certain elements  and interests. My opinion is that all these impulses, sentiments,  weaknesses, and imperfections of woman are due to nothing but to  the seclusion in which she has been kept. They are the effects of an  educational and social system tottering to decay, of a system that does  not give the natural faculties of woman that room for expansion and  development which is as necessary to life as steam is to electricity  and electricity to light. And those defects and imperfections can  not be cured by continuing the system  under which they have formed  and developed, but there must be a radical reform, a regeneration,  in order that, as a bird on its first flight stretches its wings and  soars forth into space, where there is an abundance of air and light,  woman may have an opportunity to develop to their fullest extent her  faculties and instincts and to show the graceful essence of her being.    We must give woman new objectives in life and lofty occupations in  which she can test her aptitude, in order that everything defective  and ill-developed in her character and education may be eliminated  in the atmosphere of liberty and publicity, where all defects can  be brought to light without fear or pity and all vices crushed with  iron heel. This is why I desire and demand political rights for our  women. I am convinced that one of the results of this concession  will be to enrich, improve, and develop her aptitude and aspiration  to serve the high ideals of life and society. Woman will devote less  time to dress, fashions, gossip and all the other petty and trifling  things that are generally the subject of their conversation and will  endeavor to study and discuss the more serious questions of social  betterment and welfare.    Politics is not a permanent occupation that absorbs all the time of  a person who has other regular business to attend to. As a matter  of fact, not speaking of political officers and a few professional  politicians, most of the citizens devote to politics only the time  strictly necessary and which they can spare. Any man or woman depending  for his or her living or future upon politics will soon come to the  conviction that politics bring starvation instead of bread.    Politics are perfectly compatible with the domestic duties and  occupations of woman, whether she be mother, wife, or daughter. An  educated woman realizes her responsibilities; she knows how to divide  her time and will give her domestic duties the preference over any  other duties outside of the home. A woman is not liable to engage  in political activity if she is very busy at home, and when confined  to her bed by the labors and cares of maternity, she will be unable  to engage in politics, even if she were willing. Therefore, when I  hear the argument that woman will be remiss in her household duties  on account of politics and that she will neglect to take care of her  husband and children if she is given the right to vote, I frankly  confess that I am, perhaps, too dull to see the truth of it.    You insist that by divine precept the place of woman is in the home  and that of man in society, and that this is the true and proper  division of labor between the two halves of the human species. If this  is really the plan of God, will you tell me then why all religions  and all schools of ethics coincide in prescribing duties towards the  neighbor and teach us to love our fellow-beings? Did the Lord speak to  man alone, and not also to woman when amidst fire and smoke, on the  quaking mountain, he gave to the world the tables of the Decalogue  and said: \"Love thy neighbor as thyself?\" And the universal precept  contained in every code of morals and in every religion, \"Whatsoever  ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,\"--does  it refer to man alone, or does it include woman also? To me, these  precepts indicate that man and woman have duties towards others,  that they have duties towards their fellow-beings, and that they must  not confine their efforts towards happiness to the home, but extend  them beyond it, to society. Will you tell me whether there can be  happiness in the homes if society is not happy, seeing that society  is nothing but the extension and sum of all the homes, and that all  the suffering and evils that afflict society find their echo in the  home, just as the happiness of the home exercises an influence upon  the happiness of society?    You attempt to do something impossible: You try to divide the human  being into halves: one-half that is happy in the home and the other  that is happy in society, or vice versa. You can do it if you wish,  but then you will either have to consign all your codes which confer  upon man the government and administration of the home to the waste  basket and make others vesting these powers in woman, or if you do not  wish to do that, you will have to give woman a share in the public  affairs in order that she may, the same as in the home, assist man  in building up and strengthening the happiness of that other big home  which we call society.    You say that woman, upon appearing on the stage of politics, will  lose the respect and admiration of man; that instead of gaining  any advantages, she will lose all those inherent in her present  position, in which she is removed from any direct struggle with man,  is adorable and adored everywhere, and reigns supreme in her home with  the undisputed authority of the wife or mother, clad in the purple  of the grace and majesty with which Nature has endowed her, pure and  undefiled by the mire with which political strife and intrigue always  bespatter the reputation and dignity of those who engage in them.    I believe I have stated the position of our adversaries in terms both  poetical and precise, and when I speak of our adversaries, I include  that numerous legion of women who still hesitate to ask for the right  of suffrage, for reasons which, perhaps, deserve being called selfish.    However, the idealistic woman I have depicted will not disappear if  our women are educated in politics the same as they are educated in  the arts and sciences. A political education, far from being harmful  to the natural charms of woman, will in my opinion enhance these,  for the same reason that our modern education has given woman charms  which the woman of the past did not possess. Unless you argue that  education is in itself an evil rather than a blessing, and that it  vitiates the character instead of improving it, you can not escape the  conclusion that by increasing the knowledge and experience of woman,  you give her more vigor, more energy, and a greater personal charm.    Nothing commands greater respect than education. Education elevates a  person. From the moment that you show that you possess education, the  consideration and respect of the others are yours. Education does not  know the bar of race prejudice; through it an individual of a colored  race can win the respect and often the admiration of the white man.    Does woman ever inspire man with greater respect than when she  is instructed, when a college education has brought her to his  own level? Was woman more respected in the past, when she remained  ignorant, than she is now? I am willing to concede that she may have  been courted more assiduously, but that does not mean that she was more  respected. Do you understand by respect and consideration those empty  forms of etiquette which make a man bow down to the ground to a woman  and regale her with a few hollow compliments, designed to tickle the  vanity or turn the head of a credulous and frivolous being? Do you  call respect the singular habit of certain men to always find the  eyes of the woman to whom they are speaking divine, to compare her  mouth to a rosebud, her teeth to a string of beautiful pearls, and  her form to the slender willow, and"]]]
