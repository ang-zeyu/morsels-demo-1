The success of the early administration of the province,  which a few years after annexation made it possible to use its resources  in fighting men to help in the task of putting down the mutiny, has  always been a matter of just pride, while the less familiar story of the  conquests of peace in the first sixty years of British rule may well  arouse similar feelings.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Arms of Panjab.]    ~Scope of work.~--A geography of the Panjab will fitly embrace an account  also of the North-West Frontier Province, which in 1901 was severed  from it and formed into a separate administration, of the small area  recently placed directly under the government of India on the transfer  of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, and of the native states in  political dependence on the Panjab Government. It will also be  convenient to include Kashmir and the tribal territory beyond the  frontier of British India which is politically controlled from Peshawar.  The whole tract covers ten degrees of latitude and eleven of longitude.  The furthest point of the Kashmir frontier is in 37 deg. 2' N., which is  much the same as the latitude of Syracuse. In the south-east the Panjab  ends at 27 deg. 4' N., corresponding roughly to the position of the  southernmost of the Canary Islands. Lines drawn west from Peshawar and  Lahore would pass to the north of Beirut and Jerusalem respectively.  Multan and Cairo are in the same latitude, and so are Delhi and  Teneriffe. Kashmir stretches eastwards to longitude 80 deg. 3' and the  westernmost part of Waziristan is in 69 deg. 2' E.    ~Distribution of Area.~--The area dealt with is roughly 253,000 square  miles. This is but two-thirteenths of the area of the Indian Empire, and  yet it is less by only 10,000 square miles than that of Austria-Hungary  including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area consists of:                                                                  sq. miles      (1) The Panjab                                                 97,000    (2) Native States dependent on Panjab Government               36,500    (3) Kashmir                                                    81,000    (4) North West Frontier Province                               13,000    (5) Tribal territory under the political control of the Chief    Commissioner of North West Frontier Province, roughly          25,500    Approximately 136,000 square miles may be classed as highlands and  117,000 as plains, and these may be distributed as follows over the  above divisions:                                                      Highlands   Plains                                                    sq. miles   sq. miles      (1) Panjab, British                                11,000   86,000    (2) Panjab, Native States                          12,000   24,500    (3) Kashmir                                        81,000     --    (4) North West Frontier Province                    6,500    6,500    (5) Tribal Territory                               25,500     --    On the north the highlands include the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan  (Siwalik) tracts to the south and east of the Indus, and north of that  river the Muztagh-Karakoram range and the bleak salt plateau beyond that  range reaching almost up to the Kuenlun mountains. To the west of the  Indus they include those spurs of the Hindu Kush which run into Chitral  and Dir, the Buner and Swat hills, the Safed Koh, the Waziristan hills,  the Suliman range, and the low hills in the trans-Indus districts of the  North West Frontier Province.    ~Boundary with China.~--There is a point to the north of Hunza in Kashmir  where three great mountain chains, the Muztagh from the south-east, the  Hindu Kush from the south-west, and the Sarikol (an offshoot of the  Kuenlun) from the north-east, meet. It is also the meeting-place of the  Indian, Chinese, and Russian empires and of Afghanistan. Westwards from  this the boundary of Kashmir and Chinese Turkestan runs for 350 miles  (omitting curves) through a desolate upland lying well to the north of  the Muztagh-Karakoram range. Finally in the north-east corner of Kashmir  the frontier impinges on the great Central Asian axis of the Kuenlun.  From this point it turns southwards and separates Chinese Tibet from the  salt Lingzi Thang plains and the Indus valley in Kashmir, and the  eastern part of the native state of Bashahr, which physically form a  portion of Tibet.    ~Boundary with United Provinces.~--The south-east corner of Bashahr is a  little to the north of the great Kedarnath peak in the Central Himalaya  and of the source of the Jamna. Here the frontier strikes to the west  dividing Bashahr from Teri Garhwal, a native state under the control of  the government of the United Provinces. Turning again to the south it  runs to the junction of the Tons and Jamna, separating Teri Garhwal from  Sirmur and some of the smaller Simla Hill States. Henceforth the Jamna  is with small exceptions the boundary between the Panjab and the United  Provinces.    ~Boundary with Afghanistan.~--We must now return to our starting-point at  the eastern extremity of the Hindu Kush, and trace the boundary with  Afghanistan. The frontier runs west and south-west along the Hindu Kush  to the Dorah pass dividing Chitral from the Afghan province of Wakhan,  and streams which drain into the Indus from the head waters of the Oxus.  At the Dorah pass it turns sharply to the south, following a great spur  which parts the valley of the Chitral river (British) from that of its  Afghan affluent, the Bashgol. Below the junction of the two streams at  Arnawai the Chitral changes its name and becomes the Kunar. Near this  point the \"Durand\" line begins. In 1893 an agreement was made between  the Amir Abdurrahman and Sir Mortimer Durand as representative of the  British Government determining the frontier line from Chandak in the  valley of the Kunar, twelve miles north of Asmar, to the Persian border.  Asmar is an Afghan village on the left bank of the Kunar to the south of  Arnawai. In 1894 the line was demarcated along the eastern watershed of  the Kunar valley to Nawakotal on the confines of Bajaur and the country  of the Mohmands.    Thence the frontier, which has not been demarcated, passes through the  heart of the Mohmand country to the Kabul river and beyond it to our  frontier post in the Khaibar at Landikhana.    From this point the line, still undemarcated, runs on in a  south-westerly direction to the Safed Koh, and then strikes west along  it to the Sikaram mountain near the Paiwar Kotal at the head of the  Kurram valley. From Sikaram the frontier runs south and south-east  crossing the upper waters of the Kurram, and dividing our possessions  from the Afghan province of Khost. This line was demarcated in 1894.    At the south of the Kurram valley the frontier sweeps round to the west  leaving in the British sphere the valley of the Tochi. Turning again to  the south it crosses the upper waters of the Tochi and passes round the  back of Waziristan by the Shawal valley and the plains about Wana to  Domandi on the Gomal river, where Afghanistan, Biluchistan, and the  North West Frontier Province meet. The Waziristan boundary was  demarcated in 1895.    ~Political and Administrative Boundaries.~--The boundary described above  defines spheres of influence, and only in the Kurram valley does it  coincide with that of the districts for whose orderly administration we  hold ourselves responsible. All we ask of Wazirs, Afridis, or Mohmands  is to leave our people at peace; we have no concern with their quarrels  or blood feuds, so long as they abide in their mountains or only leave  them for the sake of lawful gain. Our administrative boundary, which  speaking broadly we took over from the Sikhs, usually runs at the foot  of the hills. A glance at the map will show that between Peshawar and  Kohat the territory of the independent tribes comes down almost to the  Indus. At this point the hills occupied by the Jowaki section of the  Afridi tribe push out a great tongue eastwards. Our military frontier  road runs through these hills, and we actually pay the tribesmen of the  Kohat pass for our right of way. Another tongue of tribal territory  reaches right down to the Indus, and almost severs the Peshawar and  Hazara districts. Further north the frontier of Hazara lies well to the  east of the Indus.    ~Frontier with Biluchistan.~--At Domandi the frontier turns to the east,  and following the Gomal river to its junction with the Zhob at Kajuri  Kach forms the boundary of the two British administrations. Henceforth  the general direction of the line is determined by the trend of the  Suliman range. It runs south to the Vehoa pass, where the country of the  Pathans of the North West Frontier Province ends and that of the Hill  and Plain Biluches subject to the Panjab Government begins. From the  Vehoa pass to the Kaha torrent the line is drawn so as to leave Biluch  tribes with the Panjab and Pathan tribes with the Biluchistan Agency.  South of the Kaha the division is between Biluch tribes, the Marris and  Bugtis to the west being managed from Quetta, and the Gurchanis and  Mazaris, who are largely settled in the plains, being included in Dera  Ghazi Khan, the trans-Indus district of the Panjab. At the south-west  corner of the Dera Ghazi Khan district the Panjab, Sind, and Biluchistan  meet. From this point the short common boundary of the Panjab and Sind  runs east to the Indus.    ~The Southern Boundary.~--East of the Indus the frontier runs south-east  for about fifty miles parting Sind from the Bahawalpur State, till a  point is reached where Sind, Rajputana, and Bahawalpur join. A little  further to the east is the southern extremity of Bahawalpur at 70 deg. 8' E.  and 27 deg. 5' N.
