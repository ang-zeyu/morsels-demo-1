Could not I give myself up to the general    testimony of mankind, I should to the relations of    particular persons who are now living, and whom I cannot    distrust in other matters of fact.' Samuel Johnson (whose    prejudices were equalled only by his range of knowledge)    proved his faith in a well-known case, if afterwards he    advanced so far as to consider the question as to the    reality of 'ghosts' as _undecided_. Sir W. Scott, who wrote    when the profound metaphysical inquiries of Hume had gained    ground (it is observable), is quite sceptical.    The origin of witchcraft and the vulgar diabolism is to be found  in the rude beginnings of the religious or superstitious feeling  which, known amongst the present savage nations as Fetishism,  probably prevailed almost universally in the earliest ages; while  that of the sublimer magic is discovered in the religious systems  of the ancient Chaldeans and Persians. Chaldea and Egypt were the  first, as far as is known, to cultivate the science of magic: the  former people long gave the well-known name to the professional  practisers of the art. Cicero (_de Divinatione_) celebrates, and  the Jewish prophets frequently deride, their skill in divination  and their modes of incantation. The story of Daniel evidences how  highly honoured and lucrative was the magical or divining  faculty. The Chazdim, or Chaldeans, a priestly caste inhabiting a  wide and level country, must have soon applied themselves to the  study, so useful to their interests, of their brilliant expanse  of heavens. By a prolonged and 'daily observation,' considerable  knowledge must have been attained; but in the infancy of the  science astronomy necessarily took the form of an empirical art  which, under the name of astrology, engaged the serious attention  and perplexed the brains of the mediaeval students of science or  magic (nearly synonymous terms), and which still survives in  England in the popular almanacks. The natural objects of  veneration to the inhabitants of Assyria were the glorious  luminaries of the sun and moon; and if their worship of the stars  and planets degenerated into many absurd fancies, believing an  intimate connection and subordination of human destiny to  celestial influences, it may be admitted that a religious  sentiment of this kind in its primitive simplicity was more  rational, or at least sublime, than most other religious systems.    It is not necessary to trace the oriental creeds of magic further  than they affected modern beliefs; but in the divinities and  genii of Persia are more immediately traced the spiritual  existences of Jewish and Christian belief. From the Persian  priests are derived both the name and the practice of magic. The  Evil Principle of the Magian, of the later Jewish, and thence of  the western world, originated in the system (claiming Zoroaster  as its founder), which taught a duality of Gods. The philosophic  lawgiver, unable to penetrate the mystery of the empire of evil  and misery in the world, was convinced that there is an equal and  antagonistic power to the representative of light and goodness.  Hence the continued eternal contention between Ormuzd with the  good spirits or genii, Amchaspands, on one side, and Ahriman with  the Devs (who may represent the infernal crew of Christendom) on  the other. Egypt, in the Mosaic and Homeric ages, seems to have  attained considerable skill in magic, as well as in chymistry and  astrology. As an abstruse and esoteric doctrine, it was strictly  confined to the priests, or to the favoured few who were admitted  to initiation. The magic excellence of the magicians, who  successfully emulated the miracles of Moses, was apparently  assisted by a legerdemain similar to that of the Hindu jugglers  of the present day.[5]      [5] The names of two of these magicians, Jannes and Jambres,    have been preserved by revelation or tradition.    In Persian theology, the shadowy idea of the devil of western  Asia was wholly different from the grosser conception of  Christendom. Neither the evil principle of Magianism nor the  witch of Palestine has much in common with the Christian. 'No  contract of subjection to a diabolic power, no infernal stamp or  sign of such a fatal league, no revellings of Satan and his  hags,'[6] no such materialistic notions could be conformable to  the spirit of Judaism or at least of Magianism. It is not  difficult to find the cause of this essential dissimilarity. A  simple unity was severely inculcated by the religion and laws of  Moses, which permitted little exercise of the imagination: while  the Magi were equally severe against idolatrous forms. A  monstrous idea, like that of 'Satan and his hags,' was impossible  to them. Christianity, the religion of the West, has received  its _corporeal_ ideas of demonology from the divinities and  demons of heathenism. The Satyri and Fauni of Greece and Rome  have suggested in part the form, and perhaps some of the  characteristics, of the vulgar Christian devil. A knowledge of  the arts of magic among the Jews was probably derived from their  Egyptian life, while the Bedouins of Arabia and Syria (kindred  peoples) may have instilled the less scientific rites of  Fetishism. It is in the early accounts of that people that  sorcery, whatever its character and profession, with the allied  arts of divination, necromancy, incantations, &c., appears most  flourishing. The Mosaic penalty, 'Thou shalt not suffer a witch  to live,' and the comprehensive injunction, 'There shall not be  found among you that maketh his son or his daughter to pass  through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of  times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter  with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer,' indicate  at once the extent and the horror of the practice. Balaam (that  equivocal prophet), on the border-land of Arabia and Palestine,  was courted and dreaded as a wizard who could perplex whole  armies by means of spells. His fame extended far and wide; he was  summoned from his home beyond the Euphrates in the mountains of  Mesopotamia by the Syrian tribes to repel the invading enemy.  This great magician was, it seems, universally regarded as 'the  rival and the possible conqueror of Moses.'[7]      [6] Sir W. Scott, _Letters on Demonology_.      [7] Dean Stanley's _Lectures on the Jewish Church_.    About the time when the priestly caste had to yield to a profane  monarchy, the forbidden practices were so notorious and the evil  was of such magnitude, that the newly-elected prince 'ejected'  (as Josephus relates) 'the fortune-tellers, necromancers, and all  such as exercised the like arts.' His interview with the witch  has some resemblance to modern _diablerie_ in the circumstances.  Reginald Scot's rationalistic interpretation of this scene may be  recommended to the commentating critics who have been so much at  a loss to explain it. He derides the received opinion of the  woman of Endor being an agent of the devil, and ignoring any  mystery, believes, 'This Pythonist being a _ventriloqua_, that  is, speaking as it were from the bottom of her belly, did cast  herself into a trance and so abused Saul, answering to Saul  in Samuel's name in her counterfeit hollow voice.[8] An  institution very popular with the Jews of the first temple,  often commemorated in their scriptures--the schools of the  prophets--was (it is not improbable) of the same kind as the  schools of Salamanca and Salerno in the middle ages, where magic  was publicly taught as an abstruse and useful science; and when  Jehu justifies his conduct towards the queen-mother by bringing a  charge of witchcraft, he only anticipates an expedient common and  successful in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  A Jewish prophet asserts of the Babylonian kings, that they were  diligent cultivators of the arts, reproaching them with  practising against the holy city.      [8] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, lib. viii. chap. 12. The    contrivance of this illusion was possibly like that at    Delphi, where in the centre of the temple was a chasm, from    which arose an intoxicating smoke, when the priestess was to    announce divine revelations. Seated over the chasm upon the    tripod, the Pythia was inspired, it seems, by the soporific    and maddening drugs.    Yet if we may credit the national historian (not to mention the  common traditions), the Chaldean monarch might have justly  envied, if he could scarcely hope to emulate, the excellence of a  former prince of his now obscure province. Josephus says of  Solomon that, amongst other attainments, 'God enabled him to  learn that skill which expels demons, which is a science useful  and sanative to men. He composed such incantations also by which  distempers are alleviated, and he left behind him the manner of  using exorcisms by which they drive away demons so that they  never return.'[9] The story of Daniel is well known. In the  captivity of the two tribes carried away into an honourable  servitude he soon rose into the highest favour, because, as we  are informed, he excelled in a divination that surpassed all the  art of the Chaldeans, themselves so famous for it. The inspired  Jew had divined a dream or vision which puzzled 'the magicians,  and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans,'  and immediately was rewarded with the greatest gift at the  disposal of a capricious despot. Most of the apologetic writers  on witchcraft, in particular the authors of the 'Malleus  Maleficarum,' accept the assertion of the author of the history  of Daniel that Nebuchadnezzar was '"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#3)"],[1,"tarian, as it is commonly called, is the diet best  suited to man. This conclusion has been arrived at by many distinguished  men of science, among whom are the above mentioned. But the proof of the  pudding is in the eating, and to prove that the vegetarian is the most  hygienic diet, we must examine the physical conditions of those nations  and individuals who have lived, and do live, upon this diet.    It might be mentioned, parenthetically, that among animals, the  herbivora are as strong physically as any species of carnivora. The most  laborious work of the world is performed by oxen, horses, mules, camels,  elephants, all vegetable-feeding animals. What animal possesses the  enormous strength of the herbivorous rhinoceros, who, travellers relate,  uproots trees and grinds whole trunks to powder? Again, the frugivorous  orang-outang is said to be more than a match for the African lion.  Comparing herbivora and carnivora from this point of view Dr. Kingsford  writes: 'The carnivora, indeed, possess one salient and terrible  quality, ferocity, allied to thirst for blood; but power, endurance,  courage, and intelligent capacity for toil belong to those animals who  alone, since the world has had a history, have been associated with the  fortunes, the conquests, and the achievements of men.'    Charles Darwin, reverenced by all educated people as a scientist of the  most keen and accurate observation, wrote in his _Voyage of the Beagle_,  the following with regard to the Chilian miners, who, he tells us, live  in the cold and high regions of the Andes: 'The labouring class work  very hard. They have little time allowed for their meals, and during  summer and winter, they begin when it is light and leave off at dusk.  They are paid L1 sterling a month and their food is given them: this,  for breakfast, consists of sixteen figs and two small loaves of bread;  for dinner, boiled beans; for supper, broken roasted wheat-grain. They  scarcely ever taste meat.' This is as good as saying that the strongest  men in the world, performing the most arduous work, and living in an  exhilarating climate, are practically strict vegetarians.    Dr. Jules Grand, President of the Vegetarian Society of France speaks of  'the Indian runners of Mexico, who offer instances of wonderful  endurance, and eat nothing but tortillas of maize, which they eat as  they run along; the street porters of Algiers, Smyrna, Constantinople  and Egypt, well known for their uncommon strength, and living on nothing  but maize, rice, dates, melons, beans, and lentils. The Piedmontese  workmen, thanks to whom the tunnelling of the Alps is due, feed on  polenta, (maize-broth). The peasants of the Asturias, like those of the  Auvergne, scarcely eat anything except chick-peas and chestnuts ...  statistics prove ... that the most numerous population of the globe is  vegetarian.'    The following miscellaneous excerpta are from Smith's _Fruits and  Farinacea_:--    'The peasantry of Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Poland, Germany,  Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and of almost every  country in Europe subsist principally, and most of them entirely, on  vegetable food.... The Persians, Hindoos, Burmese, Chinese, Japanese,  the inhabitants of the East Indian Archipelago, and of the mountains of  the Himalaya, and, in fact, most of the Asiatics, live upon vegetable  productions.'    'The people of Russia, generally, subsist on coarse black rye-bread and  garlics. I have often hired men to labour for me. They would come on  board in the morning with a piece of black bread weighing about a pound,  and a bunch of garlics as big as one's fist. This was all their  nourishment for the day of sixteen or eighteen hours' labour. They were  astonishingly powerful and active, and endured severe and protracted  labour far beyond any of my men. Some of these Russians were eighty and  even ninety years old, and yet these old men would do more work than any  of the middle-aged men belonging to my ship. Captain C. S. Howland of  New Bedford, Mass.'    'The Chinese feed almost entirely on rice, confections and fruits; those  who are enabled to live well and spend a temperate life, are possessed  of great strength and agility.'    'The Egyptian cultivators of the soil, who live on coarse wheaten bread,  Indian corn, lentils, and other productions of the vegetable kingdom,  are among the finest people I have even seen. Latherwood.'    'The Greek boatmen are exceedingly abstemious. Their food consists of a  small quantity of black bread, made of unbolted rye or wheatmeal, and a  bunch of grapes, or raisins, or some figs. They are astonishingly  athletic and powerful; and the most nimble, active, graceful, cheerful,  and even merry people in the world. Judge Woodruff, of Connecticut.'    'From the day of his irruption into Europe the Turk has always proved  himself to be endowed with singularly strong vitality and energy. As a  member of a warlike race, he is without equal in Europe in health and  hardiness. His excellent physique, his simple habits, his abstinence  from intoxicating liquors, and his normal vegetarian diet, enable him to  support the greatest hardships, and to exist on the scantiest and  simplest food.'    'The Spaniards of Rio Salada in South America,--who come down from the  interior, and are employed in transporting goods overland,--live wholly  on vegetable food. They are large, very robust, and strong; and bear  prodigious burdens on their backs, travelling over mountains too steep  for loaded mules to ascend, and with a speed which few of the generality  of men can equal without incumbrance.'    'In the most heroic days of the Grecian army, their food was the plain  and simple produce of the soil. The immortal Spartans of Thermopylae  were, from infancy, nourished by the plainest and coarsest vegetable  aliment: and the Roman army, in the period of their greatest valour and  most gigantic achievements, subsisted on plain and coarse vegetable  food. When the public games of Ancient Greece--for the exercise of  muscular power and activity in wrestling, boxing, running, etc.,--were  first instituted, the athletae in accordance with the common dietetic  habits of the people, were trained entirely on vegetable food.'    Dr. Kellogg, an authority on dietetics, makes the following answer to  those who proclaim that those nations who eat a large amount of  flesh-food, such as the English, are the strongest and dominant nations:  \"While it is true that the English nation makes large use of animal  food, and is at the same time one of the most powerful on the globe, it  is also true that the lowest, most miserable classes of human beings,  such as the natives of Australia, and the inhabitants of Terra del  Fuego, subsist almost wholly upon flesh. It should also be borne in mind  that it is only within a single generation that the common people of  England have become large consumers of flesh. In former times and when  England was laying the foundation of her greatness, her sturdy yeomen  ate less meat in a week, than the average Englishman of the present  consumes in a single day.... The Persians, the Grecians, and the Romans,  became ruling nations while vegetarians.\"    In _Fruits and Farinacea_, Professor Lawrence is quoted as follows:  'The inhabitants of Northern Europe and Asia, the Laplanders, Samoiedes,  Ostiacs, Tangooses, Burats, Kamtschatdales, as well as the natives of  Terra del Fuego in the Southern extremity of America, are the smallest,  weakest, and least brave people on the globe; although they live almost  entirely on flesh, and that often raw.'    Many athletic achievements of recent date have been won by vegetarians  both in this country and abroad. The following successes are  noteworthy:--Walking: Karl Mann, Dresden to Berlin, Championship of  Germany; George Allen, Land's End to John-o'-Groats. Running: E. R.  Voigt, Olympic Championship, etc.: F. A. Knott, 5,000 metres Belgian  record. Cycling: G. A. Olley, Land's End to John-o'-Groats record.  Tennis: Eustace Miles, M.A., various championships, etc. Of especial  interest at the present moment are a series of tests and experiments  recently carried out at Yale University, U.S.A., under Professor Irving  Fisher, with the object of discovering the suitability of different  dietaries for athletes, and the effect upon the human system in general.  The results were surprising. 'One of the most severe tests,' remarks  Professor Fisher, 'was in deep knee-bending, or \"squatting.\" Few of the  meat-eaters could \"squat\" more than three to four hundred times. On the  other hand a Yale student who had been a flesh-abstainer for two years,  did the deep knee-bending eighteen hundred times without exhaustion....  One remarkable difference between the two sets of men was the  comparative absence of soreness in the muscles of the meat-abstainers  after the tests.'    The question as to climate is often raised; many people labour under the  idea that a vegetable diet may be suitable in a hot climate, but not in  a cold. That this idea is false is shown by facts, some of which the  above quotations supply. That man can live healthily in arctic regions  on a vegetable diet has been amply demonstrated. In a cold climate the  body requires a considerable quantity of heat-producing food, that is,  food containing a good supply of hydrocarbons (fats), and carbohydrates  (starches and sugars). Many vegetable foods are rich in these  properties, as will be explained in the essay following dealing with  dietetics. Strong and enduring vegetable-feeding animals, such as the  musk-ox and the reindeer, flourish on the scantiest food in an arctic  climate, and there is no evidence to show that man could not equally  well subsist on vegetable food under similar conditions.
