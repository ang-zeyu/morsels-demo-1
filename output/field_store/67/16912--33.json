Nine of these are enumerated, and they go pretty  thoroughly into the brute toughness of the psychic nature.    Sickness is included rather for its effect on the emotions and mind,  since bodily infirmity, such as blindness or deafness, is no insuperable  barrier to spiritual life, and may sometimes be a help, as cutting off  distractions. It will be well for us to ponder over each of these nine  activities, thinking of each as a psychic state, a barrier to the interior  consciousness of the spiritual man.    31. Grieving, despondency, bodily restlessness, the drawing in and  sending forth of the life-breath also contribute to drive the psychic  nature to and fro.    The first two moods are easily understood. We can well see bow a  sodden psychic condition, flagrantly opposed to the pure and positive  joy of spiritual life, would be a barrier. The next, bodily restlessness,  is in a special way the fault of our day and generation. When it is  conquered, mental restlessness will be half conquered, too.    The next two terms, concerning the life breath, offer some difficulty.  The surface meaning is harsh and irregular breathing; the deeper  meaning is a life of harsh and irregular impulses.    32. Steady application to a principle is the way to put a stop to these.    The will, which, in its pristine state, was full of vigour, has been  steadily corrupted by self-indulgence, the seeking of moods and  sensations for sensation's sake. Hence come all the morbid and sickly  moods of the mind. The remedy is a return to the pristine state of the  will, by vigorous, positive effort; or, as we are here told, by steady  application to a principle. The principle to which we should thus  steadily apply ourselves should be one arising from the reality of  spiritual life; valorous work for the soul, in others as in ourselves.    33. By sympathy with the happy, compassion for the sorrowful,  delight in the holy, disregard of the unholy, the psychic nature moves  to gracious peace.    When we are wrapped up in ourselves, shrouded with the cloak of our  egotism, absorbed in our pains and bitter thoughts, we are not willing  to disturb or strain our own sickly mood by giving kindly sympathy to  the happy, thus doubling their joy, or by showing compassion for the  sad, thus halving their sorrow. We refuse to find delight in holy things,  and let the mind brood in sad pessimism on unholy things. All these  evil psychic moods must be conquered by strong effort of will. This  rending of the veils will reveal to us something of the grace and peace  which are of the interior consciousness of the spiritual man.    34. Or peace may be reached by the even sending forth and control  of the life-breath.    Here again we may look for a double meaning: first, that even and  quiet breathing which is a part of the victory over bodily restlessness;  then the even and quiet tenor of life, without harsh or dissonant  impulses, which brings stillness to the heart.    35. Faithful, persistent application to any object, if completely  attained, will bind the mind to steadiness.    We are still considering how to overcome the wavering and  perturbation of the psychic nature, which make it quite unfit to  transmit the inward consciousness and stillness. We are once more  told to use the will, and to train it by steady and persistent work: by  \"sitting close\" to our work, in the phrase of the original.    36. As also will a joyful, radiant spirit.    There is no such illusion as gloomy pessimism, and it has been truly  said that a man's cheerfulness is the measure of his faith. Gloom,  despondency, the pale cast of thought, are very amenable to the will.  Sturdy and courageous effort will bring a clear and valorous mind.  But it must always be remembered that this is not for solace to the  personal man, but is rather an offering to the ideal of spiritual life, a  contribution to the universal and universally shared treasure in heaven.    37. Or the purging of self-indulgence from the psychic nature.    We must recognize that the fall of man is a reality, exemplified in our  own persons. We have quite other sins than the animals, and far more  deleterious; and they have all come through self-indulgence, with  which our psychic natures are soaked through and through. As we  climbed down hill for our pleasure, so must we climb up again for our  purification and restoration to our former high estate. The process is  painful, perhaps, yet indispensable.    38. Or a pondering on the perceptions gained in dreams and dreamless  sleep.    For the Eastern sages, dreams are, it is true, made up of images of  waking life, reflections of what the eyes have seen and the ears heard.  But dreams are something more, for the images are in a sense real,  objective on their own plane; and the knowledge that there is another  world, even a dream-world, lightens the tyranny of material life. Much  of poetry and art is such a solace from dreamland. But there is more  in dream, for it may image what is above, as well as what is below; not  only the children of men, but also the children by the shore of the  immortal sea that brought us hither, may throw their images on this  magic mirror: so, too, of the secrets of dreamless sleep with its pure  vision, in even greater degree.    39. Or meditative brooding on what is dearest to the heart.    Here is a thought which our own day is beginning to grasp: that love  is a form of knowledge; that we truly know any thing or any person,  by becoming one therewith, in love. Thus love has a wisdom that the  mind cannot claim, and by this hearty love, this becoming one with  what is beyond our personal borders, we may take a long step toward  freedom. Two directions for this may be suggested: the pure love of  the artist for his work, and the earnest, compassionate search into the  hearts of others.    40. Thus he masters all, from the atom to the Infinite.    Newton was asked how he made his discoveries. By intending my  mind on them, he replied. This steady pressure, this becoming one  with what we seek to understand, whether it be atom or soul, is the  one means to know. When we become a thing, we really know it, not  otherwise. Therefore live the life, to know the doctrine; do the will of  the Father, if you would know the Father.    41. When the perturbations of the psychic nature have all been stilled,  then the consciousness, like a pure crystal, takes the colour of what it  rests on, whether that be the perceiver, perceiving, or the thing  perceived.    This is a fuller expression of the last Sutra, and is so lucid that  comment can hardly add to it. Everything is either perceiver,  perceiving, or the thing perceived; or, as we might say, consciousness,  force, or matter. The sage tells us that the one key will unlock the  secrets of all three, the secrets of consciousness, force and matter  alike. The thought is, that the cordial sympathy of a gentle heart,  intuitively understanding the hearts of others, is really a manifestation  of the same power as that penetrating perception whereby one divines  the secrets of planetary motions or atomic structure.    42. When the consciousness, poised in perceiving, blends together the  name, the object dwelt on and the idea, this is perception with exterior  consideration.    In the first stage of the consideration of an external object, the  perceiving mind comes to it, preoccupied by the name and idea  conventionally associated with that object. For example, in coming to  the study of a book, we think of the author, his period, the school to  which he belongs. The second stage, set forth in the next Sutra, goes  directly to the spiritual meaning of the book, setting its traditional  trappings aside and finding its application to our own experience and  problems.    The commentator takes a very simple illustration: a cow, where one  considers, in the first stage, the name of the cow, the animal itself and  the idea of a cow in the mind. In the second stage, one pushes these  trappings aside and, entering into the inmost being of the cow, shares  its consciousness, as do some of the artists who paint cows. They get  at the very life of what they study and paint.    43. When the object dwells in the mind, clear of memory-pictures,  uncoloured by the mind, as a pure luminous idea, this is perception  without exterior or consideration.    We are still considering external, visible objects. Such perception as  is here described is of the nature of that penetrating vision whereby  Newton, intending his mind on things, made his discoveries, or that  whereby a really great portrait painter pierces to the soul of him whom  he paints, and makes that soul live on canvas. These stages of  perception are described in this way, to lead the mind up to an  understanding of the piercing soul-vision of the spiritual man, the  immortal.    44. The same two steps, when referring to things of finer substance,  are said to be with, or without, judicial action of the mind.    We now come to mental or psychical objects: to images in the mind.  It is precisely by comparing, arranging and superposing these  mind-images that we get our general notions or concepts. This  process of analysis and synthesis, whereby we select certain qualities  in a group of mind-images, and then range together those of like  quality, is the judicial action of the mind spoken of. But when we  exercise swift divination upon the mind images, as does a poet or a  man of genius, then we use a power higher than the judicial, and one  nearer to the keen vision of the spiritual man.    45. Subtle substance rises in ascending degrees, to that pure nature  which has no distinguishing mark.    As we ascend from outer material things which are permeated by  separateness, and whose chief characteristic is to be separate, just as  so many pebbles are separate from each other; as we ascend, first, to  mind-images, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#3)"],[1,"after an  episcopate of twelve years and retired across the Channel. Returning  in answer to the entreaties of Laurentius, \"the Londoners would not  receive Bishop Mellitus, choosing rather to be under their idolatrous  high priests.\" Eventually he succeeded Laurentius at Canterbury. And  for a second time London relapsed into paganism.    Thus the good fruits of the mission of Augustine were completely lost.  An interval occurs, and then Sigebert the Good, on a visit to King  Oswy of Northumbria, was converted by the reasoning of his host, and  baptised by Bishop Finan of Lindisfarne. Finan had no connection with  Rome, but belonged to that remarkable body who traced their origin to  Ireland and Iona. Sigebert took south with him two brothers, English  by race, recommended by Finan, of whom one was CEDD; a third  brother was the more famous Chad. The work of re-planting was at once  set about with the help of Sigebert's example and protection. Up and  down the province they went, and gained so many converts that Finan  felt justified in consecrating Cedd bishop of the East Saxons. The new  bishop now employed much of his time in training converts, natives of  the province, for the priesthood, both at Ythancester, near  Tillingham, and at Tilbury.[6] He acted as interpreter at the Whitby  Conference, where he was won over to the continental method of  reckoning Easter, and died shortly after of the plague (664). A later  visitation of the pestilence is assigned as a cause of half of the  diocese relapsing, while the other half, governed by Sebbe, remained  faithful. King Wulfhere of Mercia--the then overlord--sent his own  bishop Jaruman with a number of clergy, who effected a complete  restoration. Mellitus, Cedd, Sabert, Sigebert, and Sebbe (said to have  been buried at St. Paul's) now appear in the transept windows as  founders of English Christianity.    Thus we find, after various vicissitudes and relapses, the Christian  religion planted in the East Saxon province before the end of the  seventh century. The succeeding centuries must be rapidly passed over.  A staff of clergy was formed who came to be called canons; other  endowments by degrees added; the services at St. Paul's maintained as  a model for the diocese; parish churches and monasteries built. We  must even pass over Bishop Erkenwald, the hero of so many stories, and  whose shrine was the most popular in Old St. Paul's. In 962, just  after Dunstan had left the bishopric for Canterbury, St. Paul's was  burnt, and the same year rebuilt. Both before and after this London  suffered from the ravages of the Danes.    The Primate Elfege, the victim of a drunken rabble, was buried at St.  Paul's (1014), as was Ethelred the Unready (1017), and nearly fifty  years later Edward the outlaw, the representative of the house of  Cerdic and of Alfred.    William the Norman, bishop (1051-1075) in spite of the Confessor and  his nominee the Sparrowhawk, occupied the see long enough to greet his  countrymen on taking possession; and just before his death would be  present at the great council held in his cathedral presided over by  Lanfranc. Norman though he was, he was in touch with the citizens  around his church, and earned their enduring gratitude and friendship  by obtaining a fresh grant of their privileges, as he did for the  cathedral. \"I will,\" said the Conqueror, \"the said church to be free  in all respects, as I trust my own soul to be at the Judgment Day.\"    =The Normans.=--Maurice, of course a Norman, had been only recently  elected bishop in the room of Huge de Orivalle, when the tenth century  church of Bishop Elfstan was destroyed in a fire that consumed the  greater part of the City (1086 or 1087).    He set to work to build another on a larger scale and after the  approved Anglo-Norman method. Fresh ground was procured, and houses  pulled down for the enlargement of church and churchyard. \"Barges,\"  says Mr. J.R. Green, \"came up the river with stone from Caen for the  great arches that moved the popular wonder, while street and lane were  being levelled to make space for the famous churchyard of St. Paul's.\"  Maurice died before the work was anything like finished, but Richard  de Belmeis, a most munificent prelate, devoted his episcopal revenues  for the purpose.    An earthquake in the second year of Rufus, followed two years later by  a destructive November storm, impeded the progress, but in spite of  all drawbacks and hindrances, builders and workmen toiled on, Henry I.  exempting the stone from toll. \"Such is the stateliness of its  beauty,\" said William of Malmesbury, \"that it is worthy of being  numbered amongst the most famous of buildings; such the extent of the  crypt, of such capacity the upper structure, that it seems sufficient  to contain a multitude of people.\" It was the variation of an inch or  two in the regularity of the arching of Maurice's new nave that  afterwards sorely vexed Wren.    We have now come to a time when Domesday gives us some interesting  information. A commencement had been made of endowing separate stalls.  Certain of the estates were parcelled out in this way, partly because  they may have been safer from alienation, partly that the canons might  be responsible, if necessary, for the services of religion in the  manors and townships in which their endowments, technically known  afterwards as _corpses_, were situated. In Domesday, St. Pancras,  Rugmere (in St. Pancras), and Twyford, in Willesden, appear, and may  fairly be set down as the three original _prebends_, although the term  \"prebend\" does not yet appear, neither do the distinctive names of the  stalls. To these three some would add Consumpta-per-Mare in the Essex  Walton, so called because the glebe was _consumed_ by the  encroachments of the sea. We will dismiss this obscure subject by  anticipating a little, and stating that, what with parts of the old  endowments and what with additions, by the end of the twelfth century  the thirty prebends were complete. The names and inscriptions will be  found in the account of the interior of the present Choir.    The two Caddingtons were a gift in Bedfordshire in the diocese of  Lincoln; the remaining twenty-eight were in Middlesex and Essex. The  corporate property of the Chapter by the same date must have reached  24,000 acres.[7]    The Conquest brought other changes in its train. Originally the bishop  was head of the Chapter, and the canons his assistants. But, beginning  not later than with Maurice, who held high office under the Crown, the  bishops became more and more immersed in politics, and found no time  to preside, while the Chapter would naturally raise no objection to  greater independence. What our French neighbours now call a _doyen_, a  senior from among the canons, took the bishop's vacant place, and  became dean.    John de Appleby, so late as 1364, dean by virtue of papal proviso, was  only allowed to summon the Chapter, and could not preside until he had  obtained a prebend by exchange. A hundred and fifty years later Colet  was a prebendary. I find no traces of archdeacons--London, Essex,  Middlesex, or Colchester--prior to the Conquest, but these eyes of the  bishop soon appear afterwards; and the Chanter becomes Precentor; the  Sacrist, or keeper of the plate, vestments, and other valuables,  becomes Treasurer; and the Master of the Schools, Chancellor. For the  sake of convenience looking forward a little, these changes, begun in  Norman times, were completed not long after.    =The Plantagenets.=--As in the tenth century and as in the eleventh,  that evil demon Fire for a third time, \"three days before the  Christmas of 1136,\" partially destroyed, or at least seriously  injured, St. Paul's, during a conflagration which reached from London  Bridge to beyond the Fleet. In rebuilding, the then method was to  throw a coating of the more refined Romanesque of the day over the  older work;[8] and this is how I explain an obscure passage in  Pepys--\"It is pretty here to see how the late church was but a case  wrought over the old church; for you may see the very old pillars  standing whole within the wall of this.\"[9] The old pillars of the  nave were restored, and furnished with graceful engaged columns, and  vaulting shafts rising from the ground. As the choir was afterwards  superseded by another, we cannot tell what was done to it.    We have now come to a time when it is impossible even to catalogue the  numerous stirring events which the cathedral witnessed. William  Fitzosbert the Longbeard, for thundering forth at PAUL'S  CROSS--where the citizens' folk-mote was wont to be held--against  tyranny and corruption in high quarters, suffered the extreme penalty.  But people in a higher position were soon to do the same. When John  and Innocent formed their strange alliance against the national  liberties, it was at St. Paul's that Stephen Langton produced the  Charter of Henry I. Here John publicly handed over his kingdom to the  Pope, and received it back as a vassal. Here came the counterblast,  when Louis, son of King Philip II. of France, received the kingdom  from the assembled magnates. After the death of John and Innocent the  papal claims were upheld; and at a council in 1232, at which the papal  legate presided, he took for his text, \"In the midst of the throne and  round about the throne were four beasts.\"[10] The four beasts were not  the four Evangelists, but four opposition prelates, including the two  primates and the Bishop of London, Roger the Black. It was the great  bell of St. Paul's which in the days of Simon de Montfort summoned the  citizens to rise against their king.    =Old St. Paul's completed.=--Whilst the nave was constantly witnessing  scenes like this, and whilst clergy and people were protesting against  encroachments on their liberties from abroad or at home, a new and  more magnificent choir, and a new or restored north aisle to either"]]]
