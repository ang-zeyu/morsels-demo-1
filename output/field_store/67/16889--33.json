After the tiger had gone away the rabbit said to the tiger's son, \"The  ox which your father is going to give me is marked with a white spot  on his left ear and another on his right side, isn't he?\"    \"O, no,\" replied the tiger's son. \"He is red all over with just a tiny  white spot on his right ear.\"    The rabbit worked for a while longer and then he said, \"The ox which  your father is going to give me is kept by the river, isn't he?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the tiger's son.    The rabbit had made a plan to go and get the ox without waiting to  finish his work. Just as he started off he saw the tiger returning.  The tiger noticed that the rabbit had not worked so well when he was  away. After that he stayed and watched the rabbit until the whole farm  was cleared. Then the tiger gave the rabbit the ox as he had promised.    \"You must kill this ox,\" he said to the rabbit, \"in a place where  there are neither flies nor mosquitoes.\"    The rabbit went away with the ox. After he had gone for some distance  he thought he would kill him. He heard a cock, however, crowing in  the distance and he knew that there must be a farm yard near. There  would be flies of course. He went on farther and again he thought that  he would kill the ox. The ground looked moist and damp and so did the  leaves on the bushes. Since the rabbit thought there would be  mosquitoes there he decided not to kill the ox. He went on and on and  finally he came to a high place where there was a strong breeze  blowing. \"There are no mosquitoes here,\" he said to himself. \"The  place is so far removed from any habitation that there are no flies,  either.\" He decided to kill the ox.    Just as he was ready to eat the ox, along came the tiger. \"O, rabbit,  you have been such a good friend of mine,\" said the tiger, \"and now I  am so very, very hungry that all my ribs show, as you yourself can  see. Will you not be a good kind rabbit and give me a piece of your  ox?\"    The rabbit gave the tiger a piece of the ox. The tiger devoured it in  the twinkling of an eye. Then he leaned back and said, \"Is that all  you are going to give me to eat?\"    The tiger looked so big and savage that the rabbit did not dare refuse  to give him any more of the ox. The tiger ate and ate and ate until he  had devoured that entire ox. The rabbit had been able to get only a  tiny morsel of it. He was very, very angry at the tiger.    One day not long after the rabbit went to a place not far from the  tiger's house and began cutting down big staves of wood. The tiger  soon happened along and asked him what he was doing.    \"I'm getting ready to build a stockade around myself,\" replied the  rabbit. \"Haven't you heard the orders?\" The tiger said that he hadn't  heard any orders.    \"That is very strange,\" said the rabbit. \"The order has gone forth  that every beast shall fortify himself by building a stockade around  himself. All the beasts are doing it.\"    The tiger became very much alarmed. \"O, dear! O, dear! What shall I  do,\" he cried. \"I don't know how to build a stockade. I never could do  it in the world. O, good rabbit! O, kind rabbit! You are such, a very  good friend of mine. Couldn't you, as a great favour, because of our  long friendship, build a stockade about me before you build one  around yourself?\"    The rabbit replied that he could not think of risking his own life by  building the tiger's fortifications first. Finally, however, he  consented to do it.    The rabbit cut down great quantities of long sharp sticks. He set them  firmly in the ground about the tiger. He fastened others securely over  the top until the tiger was completely shut in by strong bars. Then he  went away and left the tiger.    The tiger waited and waited for something to happen to show him the  need of the fortifications. Nothing at all happened.    He got very hungry and thirsty. After a while the monkey passed that  way.    The tiger called out, \"O, monkey, has the danger passed?\"    The monkey did not know what danger the tiger meant, but he replied,  \"Yes.\"    Then the tiger said, \"O, monkey, O, good, kind monkey, will you not  please be so kind as to help me out of my stockade?\"    \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the monkey  and he went on his way.    Along came the goat and the tiger called out, \"O, goat, has the danger  passed?\"    The goat did not know anything about any danger, but he replied,  \"Yes.\"    Then the tiger said, \"O, goat, O, good kind goat, please be so kind as  to help me out of my stockade.\"    \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the goat as  he went on his way.    Along came the armadillo and the tiger called out, \"O, armadillo, has  the danger passed?\"    The armadillo had not heard of any danger, but he replied that it had  passed.    Then the tiger said, \"O, armadillo, O, good, kind armadillo, you have  always been such a good friend and neighbour. Please help me now to  get out of my stockade.\"    \"Let the one who got you in there help you out,\" replied the armadillo  as he went on his way.    The tiger jumped and jumped with all his force at the top of the  stockade, but he could not break through. He jumped and jumped with  all his might at the front side of the stockade, but he could not  break through. He thought that never in the world would he be able to  break out. He rested for a little while and as he rested he thought.  He thought how bright the sun was shining outside. He thought what  good hunting there was in the jungle. He thought how cool the water  was at the spring. Once more he jumped and jumped with all his might  at the back side of the stockade. At last he broke through. He did not  get through, however, without getting bad cuts on both his sides from  the sharp edges of the staves. Until this day the tiger has stripes on  both his sides.          V    Why the Lamb Is Meek      Once upon a time there was a little lamb frisking gaily about the  pasture. The bright sunshine and the soft breezes made him very happy.  He had just finished a hearty meal and that made him happy too. He was  the very happiest little lamb in all the world and he thought that he  was the most wonderful little lamb.    A big toad sat on the ground and watched him. After a while the toad  said: \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\"    The lamb replied that he had never felt better in all his life.    \"Even though you are feeling very strong I can pull you into the sea,\"  said the toad.    The little lamb laughed and laughed until he rolled over on the  ground.    \"Just take hold of this rope and I'll show you how easy it is to pull  you into the sea,\" said the toad.    The lamb took hold of the rope. Then the toad said, \"Please wait a  minute while I get a good long distance away from you. I can pull  better when I'm not too near you.\"    The lamb waited and the toad hopped down to the sea. He hopped up into  a tree which hung over the water's edge and from there he hopped on to  the whale's back. He fastened the end of the rope around the whale  and then he called out to the lamb: \"All ready. Now we'll see how hard  you can pull.\"    When the whale felt the lamb pulling at the rope he swam away from the  shore. No matter how hard the lamb pulled or how much force he exerted  it did not do one bit of good. He was dragged down to the water's edge  as easily as could be.    \"I give up,\" said the lamb as he reached the water's edge.    After that, although the sunshine was just as bright as ever, any one  who watched that little lamb could see that he was a little more meek.    One day not long afterwards the sunshine was again very bright and the  little lamb was again feeling frisky. He was so happy and gay that he  had forgotten all about how the toad had pulled him down to the water  until the toad spoke to him. Then he remembered.    \"O, little lamb, how are you feeling today?\" asked the toad. The  little lamb replied that he was very well.    \"Let us run a race,\" said the toad, \"I think I can beat you.\"    \"You may be strong enough to pull me into the sea,\" said the lamb,  \"but surely I can run faster than you. I've watched you hopping about  my pasture. You can't run fast at all. However, I'll gladly run a race  with you to prove what I say.\"    The toad set a goal and told the lamb to call out every little while  during the race so he could see how much farther ahead the lamb was.  Then the toad and the lamb started.    The toad had assembled all his brothers and his sisters and his  cousins and his uncles and his aunts before the race and had stationed  them at various points along the path of the race. He had told them  that whenever any of them should hear the lamb calling out, \"Laculay,  laculay, laculay,\" the toad which was nearest should answer,  \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\"    The lamb ran and ran as fast as he could. Then he remembered his  promise and called out, \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" He expected to  hear the toad answer from a long, long distance behind him. He was  much surprised to hear some one near him answer, \"Gulugubango, bango  lay.\" After that he ran faster than ever.    After running on for some distance farther the lamb again called out,  \"Laculay, laculay, laculay.\" Again he heard the answer at only a short  distance away, \"Gulugubango, bango lay.\" He ran and ran until his  little heart was beating so fast that it seemed as if it would burst.  At last he arrived at the goal of the race which the toad had set and  there sat the toad's brother who looked so much like him that the lamb  couldn't tell them apart. The lamb went back to his pasture very  meekly and quietly. He acknowledged that he had been beaten in the  race.    The next morning the toad said to him, \"Even though you did not run  fast enough to win the race, still you are a very fast runner.

A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#3)"],[1,"who boldly executed the crimes, were undoubtedly of the same pattern as  those which obtain among us to-day, but with this difference, that with  the onward march of Improvement, hand-in-hand with the progress of  Science and Civilization, have also grimly stalked fashionably-clothed  and modernly-equipped Crime and the scientifically-perfected  law-breaker, with his modern and improved methods. Man's villainies,  like his other passions, remain the same to-day as when the murderous  club of Cain crushed the skull of his brother Abel, and the maiden earth  was crimsoned with the first blood that appealed for vengeance. They  differ only in the manner of commission, and the commission would appear  to be assisted by modern invention and appliances.    To expect large civilized communities dwelling together to be free from  crime would be to imagine an elysium on earth, for where poverty exists  crime will assuredly be found, and poverty will never be divorced from  civilization. It would also appear that, in accordance with the growth  and expansion of the young city in other respects, vice and crime kept  pace, while youthful depravity early began to trouble the good people  then as it worries the same class of persons to-day, for in 1824 we find  that a House of Refuge, for the reformation of juvenile delinquents, was  built, ostensibly superseding the old \"Society for the Prevention of  Pauperism.\" To follow in detail the history of crime in this city, from  so early a date, would be of very little service here, but a simple  chronicle, referring to the periods at which prisons were found to be  necessary, may be briefly touched upon as tending to show how crime  increased and criminals multiplied, as the city grew in wealth and  population.    The new \"Staat Huys,\" before alluded to, was erected on the corner of  Pearl street and Coenties Slip, a locality then considered the most  central in the infant town, and as offering the best facilities for  securely keeping prisoners. It served its double purposes of jail and  city hall until 1698, when it was decided by the authorities to build  another--a larger and more commodious structure; while, in the meantime,  the old military block-house in the immediate neighborhood of the  Governor's residence was conscripted and made use of, additionally to  the \"Staat Huys,\" for the accommodation of the constantly-increasing  number of culprits.    The new building--City Hall--was erected on Broad street, on the ground  now covered by the sub-treasury building, and was finished in 1699, but  was not used as a jail until five years subsequent. In the winter of  1704 the sheriff was required to have the city jail prepared for the  reception of felons. Crime, however, would appear to have become a  monster of terrible mien in those days, far exceeding all the efforts of  the authorities to restrict or even to limit the number of malefactors,  aside from the apparent impossibility of diminishing them, for again, in  1758, another new jail was found absolutely necessary to the needs of  the inhabitants, and was erected on what was then known as \"The Fields,\"  now City Hall Park, and where, tradition has it, the prisoners were most  barbarously treated. This new place of confinement, together with those  previously in use, served their purpose very well until 1775, when the  new Bridewell was erected, when all were converted into military prisons  during the occupancy of the city by the British. The frightful cruelties  that were then practiced upon the patriot soldiers, unfortunate enough  to be inmates of those prisons, are too familiar to every one to need  mention here.    Shortly after the Revolution, the Penitentiary was established at  Bellevue. In 1816, a portion of the almshouse was set apart for the  punishment of felons, by the institution of the treadmill. This was on  Twenty-sixth street, near First avenue, the present site of Bellevue  Hospital, and its part occupancy as a prison somewhat relieved the  overcrowded condition of the jail. The city jail still continued in City  Hall Park, and was used as a debtors' prison, remaining so until 1832,  when it was entirely converted into the Register's Office, the present  Hall of Records, and is such to this day. It stands opposite the _Staats  Zeitung_ building in old Tryon Row.    The Penitentiary was soon found to be too small for the keeping of the  greatly-increased number of prisoners, and so, in 1836, the buildings on  Blackwell's Island were constructed, and two years later, again, the  Tombs, the sombre, miasmatic, Egyptian edifice on Centre street, was  completed; which latter had been in course of construction for some  years.    In addition to the prisons previously alluded to, there was begun, in  1796, a state prison, which was erected in the Village of Greenwich,  about West Tenth street, near the North River, and which is still in  existence to-day (1886), being occupied by, and known as, the Empire  Brewery. It was used as a state prison until the completion of the  present extensive buildings at Sing Sing, on the Hudson.    Such is, briefly, a history of the establishment of the prisons of this  city, but of the unfortunate class of criminals that have, from time to  time, occupied them, much remains to be said, and will be found in the  succeeding pages.        CHAPTER II.    CRIMINALS AND THEIR HAUNTS.    _The Past and Present Gangs of the City--How and Where They  Herd--Prominent Characters that Have Passed into History._    New York, from being the largest city on the western hemisphere; in  almost hourly communication with every part of the known world; the vast  wealth of its merchants; elegant storehouses crowded with the choicest  and most costly goods, manufactured fabrics, and every kind of valuable  representing money; with its great banks, whose vaults and safes contain  more bullion than could be transported by the largest ship afloat; its  colossal establishments teeming with diamonds, jewelry and precious  stones gathered from all parts of the known and uncivilized portions of  the globe; with all this countless wealth, these boundless riches, in  some cases insecurely guarded, in all temptingly displayed, is it any  wonder, then, that this city should always have proved the paradise of  thieves? The fact of its being the chief city of the New World, alone  caused it to be the principal magnet of attraction for all the expert  criminals of the Old World, in addition to those who were \"to the manner  born.\"    What trouble they proved to the police of some years ago, and the  frequency with which crimes of every kind were committed, is best  evidenced by referring to the records of that time, when jails and  prisons were crowded and courts and judges were kept busy trying  offenders against the laws, while the entire police and detective force  was unable and inadequate to successfully reduce the occurrence of the  one or diminish the number of the other. It was at that time  appropriately styled the \"Thieves' Paradise,\" for even after some daring  and expert felon had been captured by the authorities and securely  lodged in jail, the meshes of the law, as it then existed, were so  large, and the manner of administering justice (?) so loose, that the  higher class of criminal, possessed of political influence, or, better  still, of money, invariably escaped the punishment his crime deserved.  The very police themselves were, in many cases, in league with the  thieves and shared in the \"swag\" of the successful burglar, expert  counterfeiter, adroit pickpocket, villainous sneak and panel thief, or  daring and accomplished forger; hence crime, from being in a measure  \"protected,\" increased, criminals multiplied and prisons were made  necessarily larger.    But this was years ago, and under a far different police system than  that now in vogue, the merits and efficacy of which it will be both a  duty and a pleasure hereafter to fully mention. The collusion between  the police and the criminals, at the times of which we speak, became a  very serious matter, in which the public early began to exhibit its  temper. So late as the year 1850 it was an anxious question whether the  authorities or the lawless classes should secure the upper hand and  possess the city, and this condition of affairs, this triangular strife  of supposed law and order on one side, protection to law-breakers on the  other, and the protests of an indignant, outraged and long-suffering  people on the third, prevailed until the year that Bill Poole was  murdered by Lew Baker on Broadway, which notable event marked an epoch  in the city's history, and to some extent improved the then existing  state of affairs, as it occasioned the dispersal of a notorious gang of  swell roughs, whose power was felt in local politics, and directed the  attention of every lover of peace and justice to the enactment of better  laws and a sterner method of executing them.    About the year 1855, two classes of \"toughs,\" or, as they were dubbed in  those days, \"rowdies,\" appear to have had and maintained some control of  the city, overawing the regularly constituted authorities, intimidating  the police by their numbers, and carrying things with a high hand  generally. One class consisted of the individuals comprehended in the  title of \"Bowery Boy\"--a term which included that certain, or rather  uncertain, element of New Yorker residing in the streets running into  the Bowery and adjacent to it, below Canal street, and the other, a  rival gang, called \"Dead Rabbits,\" which unsavory distinction was  adopted by an equally questionable portion of humanity dwelling in the  Fourth and Sixth wards and streets in the vicinity of Catherine and  Roosevelt. There were among these two gangs of the city's representative  \"toughs,\" materials of a far different kind from the actual felon, but  who were none the less dangerous, and among them may be"]]]
