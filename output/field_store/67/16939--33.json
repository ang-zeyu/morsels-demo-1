[2] When the night came, fireworks were exhibited on  the great tank which washes the walls of the Palace of the Federation.  That tank was now as hard as marble; and the Dutch boasted that nothing  had ever been seen, even on the terrace of Versailles, more brilliant  than the effect produced by the innumerable cascades of flame which  were reflected in the smooth mirror of ice. [3] The English Lords  congratulated their master on his immense popularity. \"Yes,\" said he;  \"but I am not the favourite. The shouting was nothing to what it would  have been if Mary had been with me.\"    A few hours after the triumphal entry, the King attended a sitting of  the States General. His last appearance among them had been on the day  on which he embarked for England. He had then, amidst the broken words  and loud weeping of those grave Senators, thanked them for the kindness  with which they had watched over his childhood, trained his young mind,  and supported his authority in his riper years; and he had solemnly  commended his beloved wife to their care. He now came back among them  the King of three kingdoms, the head of the greatest coalition that  Europe had seen during a hundred and eighty years; and nothing was heard  in the hall but applause and congratulations. [4]    But this time the streets of the Hague were overflowing with the  equipages and retinues of princes and ambassadors who came flocking  to the great Congress. First appeared the ambitious and ostentatious  Frederic, Elector of Brandenburg, who, a few years later, took the  title of King of Prussia. Then arrived the young Elector of Bavaria,  the Regent of Wirtemberg, the Landgraves of Hesse Cassel and Hesse  Darmstadt, and a long train of sovereign princes, sprung from the  illustrious houses of Brunswick, of Saxony, of Holstein, and of Nassau.  The Marquess of Gastanaga, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, repaired  to the assembly from the viceregal Court of Brussels. Extraordinary  ministers had been sent by the Emperor, by the Kings of Spain, Poland,  Denmark, and Sweden, and by the Duke of Savoy. There was scarcely room  in the town and the neighbourhood for the English Lords and gentlemen  and the German Counts and Barons whom curiosity or official duty had  brought to the place of meeting. The grave capital of the most thrifty  and industrious of nations was as gay as Venice in the Carnival. The  walks cut among those noble limes and elms in which the villa of the  Princes of Orange is embosomed were gay with the plumes, the stars,  the flowing wigs, the embroidered coats and the gold hilted swords of  gallants from London, Berlin and Vienna. With the nobles were mingled  sharpers not less gorgeously attired than they. At night the hazard  tables were thronged; and the theatre was filled to the roof. Princely  banquets followed one another in rapid succession. The meats were  served in gold; and, according to that old Teutonic fashion with which  Shakspeare had made his countrymen familiar, as often as any of the  great princes proposed a health, the kettle drums and trumpets sounded.  Some English lords, particularly Devonshire, gave entertainments  which vied with those of Sovereigns. It was remarked that the German  potentates, though generally disposed to be litigious and punctilious  about etiquette, associated, on this occasion, in an unceremonious  manner, and seemed to have forgotten their passion for genealogical and  heraldic controversy. The taste for wine, which was then characteristic  of their nation, they had not forgotten. At the table of the Elector  of Brandenburg much mirth was caused by the gravity of the statesmen of  Holland, who, sober themselves, confuted out of Grotius and Puffendorf  the nonsense stuttered by the tipsy nobles of the Empire. One of those  nobles swallowed so many bumpers that he tumbled into the turf fire, and  was not pulled out till his fine velvet suit had been burned. [5]    In the midst of all this revelry, business was not neglected. A formal  meeting of the Congress was held at which William presided. In a short  and dignified speech, which was speedily circulated throughout Europe,  he set forth the necessity of firm union and strenuous exertion. The  profound respect with which he was heard by that splendid assembly  caused bitter mortification to his enemies both in England and in  France. The German potentates were bitterly reviled for yielding  precedence to an upstart. Indeed the most illustrious among them paid to  him such marks of deference as they would scarcely have deigned to pay  to the Imperial Majesty, mingled with the crowd in his antechamber, and  at his table behaved as respectfully as any English lord in waiting.  In one caricature the allied princes were represented as muzzled bears,  some with crowns, some with caps of state. William had them all in  a chain, and was teaching them to dance. In another caricature, he  appeared taking his ease in an arm chair, with his feet on a cushion,  and his hat on his head, while the Electors of Brandenburg and Bavaria,  uncovered, occupied small stools on the right and left; the crowd of  Landgraves and Sovereign dukes stood at humble distance; and Gastanaga,  the unworthy successor of Alva, awaited the orders of the heretic tyrant  on bended knee. [6]    It was soon announced by authority that, before the beginning of summer,  two hundred and twenty thousand men would be in the field against  France. [7] The contingent which each of the allied powers was  to furnish was made known. Matters about which it would have been  inexpedient to put forth any declaration were privately discussed by  the King of England with his allies. On this occasion, as on every other  important occasion during his reign, he was his own minister for  foreign affairs. It was necessary for the sake of form that he should be  attended by a Secretary of State; and Nottingham had therefore followed  him to Holland. But Nottingham, though, in matters concerning the  internal government of England, he enjoyed a large share of his master's  confidence, knew little more about the business of the Congress than  what he saw in the Gazettes.    This mode of transacting business would now be thought most  unconstitutional; and many writers, applying the standard of their own  age to the transactions of a former age, have severely blamed William  for acting without the advice of his ministers, and his ministers  for submitting to be kept in ignorance of transactions which deeply  concerned the honour of the Crown and the welfare of the nation. Yet  surely the presumption is that what the most honest and honourable men  of both parties, Nottingham, for example, among the Tories, and Somers  among the Whigs, not only did, but avowed, cannot have been altogether  inexcusable; and a very sufficient excuse will without difficulty be  found.    The doctrine that the Sovereign is not responsible is doubtless as old  as any part of our constitution. The doctrine that his ministers are  responsible is also of immemorial antiquity. That where there is  no responsibility there can be no trustworthy security against  maladministration, is a doctrine which, in our age and country, few  people will be inclined to dispute. From these three propositions it  plainly follows that the administration is likely to be best conducted  when the Sovereign performs no public act without the concurrence and  instrumentality of a minister. This argument is perfectly sound. But we  must remember that arguments are constructed in one way, and governments  in another. In logic, none but an idiot admits the premises and denies  the legitimate conclusion. But in practice, we see that great and  enlightened communities often persist, generation after generation, in  asserting principles, and refusing to act upon those principles. It  may be doubted whether any real polity that ever existed has exactly  corresponded to the pure idea of that polity. According to the pure idea  of constitutional royalty, the prince reigns and does not govern; and  constitutional royalty, as it now exists in England, comes nearer than  in any other country to the pure idea. Yet it would be a great error  to imagine that our princes merely reign and never govern. In the  seventeenth century, both Whigs and Tories thought it, not only the  right, but the duty, of the first magistrate to govern. All parties  agreed in blaming Charles the Second for not being his own Prime  Minister; all parties agreed in praising James for being his own Lord  High Admiral; and all parties thought it natural and reasonable that  William should be his own Foreign Secretary.    It may be observed that the ablest and best informed of those who  have censured the manner in which the negotiations of that time were  conducted are scarcely consistent with themselves. For, while they blame  William for being his own Ambassador Plenipotentiary at the Hague, they  praise him for being his own Commander in Chief in Ireland. Yet where is  the distinction in principle between the two cases? Surely every reason  which can be brought to prove that he violated the constitution, when,  by his own sole authority, he made compacts with the Emperor and  the Elector of Brandenburg, will equally prove that he violated the  constitution, when, by his own sole authority, he ordered one column to  plunge into the water at Oldbridge and another to cross the bridge of  Slane. If the constitution gave him the command of the forces of the  State, the constitution gave him also the direction of the foreign  relations of the State.

He is  writing of having discharged all his obligations to Mr. Catcott:--        \"If ever obligated to thy purse,      _Rowley discharges all, my first chief curse!_      For had I never known the antique lore,      I ne'er had ventured from my peaceful shore,      But, happy in my humble sphere, had moved      Untroubled, unsuspected, unbeloved.\"[10]    [Illustration: MUNIMENT ROOM.]    A Mr. Rudhall[11] said that, when Chatterton wrote on a parchment, he  held it over a candle to give it the appearance of antiquity; and a Mr.  Gardener has recorded, that he once saw Chatterton rub a parchment over  with ochre, and afterwards rub it on the ground, saying, \"that was the  way to antiquate it.\" This _expose_ of Chatterton's craft is so at  variance with his usual caution that we can hardly credit it. A humble  woman, Mrs. Edkins, speaks of his spending all his holidays in the  little den of a room we have mentioned, where he _locked_ himself in,  and would remain the entire day without meals, returning with his hands  and face completely begrimed with dirt and charcoal; and she well  remembers his having a charcoal pounce-bag and parchment and letters on  a little deal table, and all over the ground was a litter of parchments;  and she and his mother at one time fancied he intended to discolor  himself and run away to the gipsies; but afterwards Mrs. Edkins believed  that he was laboring at the Rowley manuscripts, and she thought he got  himself bound to a lawyer that he might get at old law books. The  testimony she bears to his affectionate tenderness towards his mother  and sister is touching: while his pride led him to seek for notoriety  for himself, it was only to render his mother and sister comfortable  that he coveted wealth.    It is not our province to enter into the controversy as to whether the  MSS. were originals or forgeries: it would seem to be as undecided  to-day as it was three quarters of a century ago; the boy \"died and made  no sign:\" and the world has not been put in possession of any additional  facts by which the question might be determined: the balance of proof  appears in favor of those who contend they were the sole offspring of  his mind, suggested merely by ancient documents from which he could have  borrowed no idea except that of rude spelling; yet it is by no means  impossible that poems did actually exist, and came into his hands, which  he altered and interpolated, but which he did not create.    In aid of his plans, Chatterton first addressed himself to Dodsley, the  Pall Mall bookseller, once with smaller poems, and afterwards on behalf  of the greatest production of his genius--the tragedy of \"Ella;\" but the  booksellers of those days were not more intellectual than those at the  present: they devoured the small forgery of the great Horace Walpole,  \"The Castle of Otranto,\" and rejected the magnificence of a nameless  composition. This man's neglect drove the young poet to the \"Autocrat of  Strawberry Hill.\" In reply he at first received a polished letter. The  literary trifler was not aware of the poverty and low station of his  correspondent, and so was courteous; he is \"grateful\" and \"singularly  obliged;\" bowing, and perfumed, and polite. Other communications  followed. Walpole inquired--discovered the poet's situation; and _then_  he changed! The poor fond boy! how hard and bitter was the rebuff. How  little had he imagined that _the_ Walpole's soul was not, _by five  shillings_, as large as the Bristol pewterer's!--that he who was an  adept at literary imposition could have been so harsh to a  fellow-sinner! The volume of his works containing \"Miscellanies of  Chatterton\" is now before us. Hear to his indignant honesty! He declares  that \"all the house of forgery are relations; and that though it be but  just to Chatterton's memory to say his poverty never made him claim  kindred with the richest, or more enriching branches, yet that his  ingenuity in counterfeiting styles, and I believe hands, might easily  have led him to those more facile imitations of prose--promissory  notes.\" The literal meaning of this paragraph stamps the littleness of  the man's mind. A slight--a very slight effort on his part might have  turned the current of the boy's thoughts, and saved him from misery and  death. We do not call Chatterton \"his victim,\" because we do not think  him so; but he, or any one in his position, might have turned him from  the love of an unworthy notoriety to the pursuit of a laudable ambition.  Following in the world's track (which he was ever careful not to  outstep), when the boy was dead, Walpole bore eloquent testimony to his  genius. The words of praise he gives his memory are like golden grains  amid the chaffy _verbiage_ with which he defends himself. If he  perceived this at first, why not have come forward hand and heart, and  shouted him on to honest fortune? But, like all _clique kings_, he made  no general cause with literature; he only smiled on his individual  worshippers, who could applaud when he said, with cruel playfulness,  \"that singing birds should not be too well fed!\"    His master, Lambert, dismissed the youth from his service, because he  had reason to suppose he meditated self-destruction; and then he  proceeded to London. How buoyant and full of hope he was during his  probationary days there, his letters to his mother and sister testify;  his gifts, also, extracted from his necessities, are evidences of the  bent of his mind--fans and china--luxuries rather than necessaries; but  in this, it must be remembered, his judgment was in fault, not his  affections. In all things he was swayed and guided by his pride,--his  indomitable pride. The period, brief as it was, of his sojourn in the  great metropolis proved that Walpole, while he neglected him so cruelly,  understood him perfectly, when he said that \"nothing in Chatterton could  be separated from Chatterton--that all he did was the effervescence of  ungovernable impulse, which, chameleon-like, imbibed the colours of all  it looked on it was Ossian, or a Saxon monk, or Gray, or Smollett, or  Junius.\" His first letter to his mother is dated, April the 26th, 1770.  He terminated his own existence on the 24th of August in the same year.  He battled with the crowded world of London, and, what was in his case a  more dire enemy than the world, his overwhelming pride, for nearly four  months. Alas! how terrible are the reflections which these few weeks  suggest! Now borne aloft upon the billows of hope, sparkling in the  fitful brightness of a feverish sun, and then plunged into the slough of  despair, his proud, dark soul disclaiming all human participation in a  misery exaggerated by his own unbending pride. Let us not talk of  denying sympathy to persons who create their own miseries; they endure  agonies thrice told. The paltry remuneration he received for his  productions is recorded by himself. Among the items is one as  extraordinary as the indignant emotion it excites:--        Received from Mr. Hamilton, for 16 songs,            10s. 6d.      Of Mr. Hamilton, for \"Candidus\" and Foreign Journal   2s.!!    We are wearied for him of the world's dark sight: yet in the same book  is recorded that the same publisher owed him L10 19s. 6d.! This sum  might have saved him, but he was too proud to ask for money; too proud  to complain; too proud to accept the invitation of his acquaintances, or  his landlady, to dine or sup with them; and all too proud to hint, even  to his mother and sister, that he was any thing but prosperous. Ardent  as if he had been a son of the hot south, he had learned nothing of  patience or expediency. His first residence was at Mrs. Walmsley's, in  Shoreditch, but, doubtless, finding the lodging too expensive, he  removed to a Mr. Angell's, sac (or dress) maker, 4, Brook Street,  Holborn. This woman, who seems to have been of a gentle nature, finding  that for two days he had confined himself to his room, and gone without  sustenance, invited him to dine with her; but he was offended, and  assured her he was not hungry. It is quite impossible to account for  this uncalled for pride. It was his nature. Lord Byron said he was mad:  according to _his_ view of the case, all eccentricity is madness; but in  the case of unhappy Chatterton, that madness which arises from \"hope  deferred,\" was unquestionably endured. Three days before his death,  pursuing, with a friend, the melancholy and speculative employment of  reading epitaphs in the churchyard of St. Pancras, absorbed by his own  reflections, he fell into a new-made grave. There was something akin to  the raven's croak, the death-fetch, the fading spectre, in this  foreboding accident: he smiled at it, and told his friend he felt the  sting of speedy dissolution:--                      \"Then black despair,      The shadow of a starless night, was thrown      Over the earth on which he moved alone.\"    At the age of seventeen years and nine months, his career ended; it was  shown that he had swallowed arsenic in water, and so--        \"perished in his pride!\"    An inquest was held, and yet though Englishmen--men who could read and  write, and hear--who must have heard of the boy's talents, either as a  poet, a satirist, or a political writer--though these men were guided by  a coroner, one, of course, in a more elevated sphere than those who  usually determine the intentions of the departed soul--yet was there not  one--NOT ONE of them all--with sufficient veneration for the casket  which had contained the diamond--not one with enough of sympathy for the  widow's son--to wrap his body in a decent shroud, and kneel in Christian  piety by his grave!--not one to pause and think that, between genius and  madness,        \"What thin partitions"]]]
