Indigestion is the end of love.          SOUPS      Asparagus Soup              4 bunches asparagus            1 small onion            1 pint milk            1/2 pint cream            1 1/2 tablespoon sugar            1 large tablespoon butter            1 1/2 tablespoon flour            pepper to season    Wash and clean asparagus, put in saucepan with just enough water to  cover, boil until little points are soft.    Cut these off and lay aside. Fry onion in the butter and put in saucepan  with the asparagus. Cook until very soft mashing occasionally so as to  extract all juice from the asparagus.    When thoroughly cooked put through sieve. Now add salt, sugar and flour  blended.    Stir constantly and add milk and cream, and serve at once. (Do not place  again on stove as it might curdle. Croutons may be served with this).      Spinach Soup              1/2 peck spinach            2 tablespoons butter            1 1/2 tablespoon sugar            1 1/2 teaspoons salt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#3)"],[1,"the multitude of your sacrifices unto  me? saith Jahveh: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat  of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs,  or of he-goats\" (Isa. i. 11). Or of Micah's inquiry, \"Will Jahveh be  pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?\"  (vi. 7.) And in the innumerable passages in which Jahveh is said to be  jealous of other gods, to be angry, to be appeased, and to repent; in  which he is represented as casting off Saul because the king does not  quite literally execute a command of the most ruthless severity; or as  smiting Uzzah to death because the unfortunate man thoughtlessly, but  naturally enough, put out his hand to stay the ark from falling--can any  one deny that the old Israelites conceived Jahveh not only in the image  of a man, but in that of a changeable, irritable, and, occasionally,  violent man? There appears to me, then, to be no reason to doubt that  the notion of likeness to man, which was indubitably held of the ghost  Elohim, was carried out consistently throughout the whole series of  Elohim, and that Jahveh-Elohim was thought of as a being of the same  substantially human nature as the rest, only immeasurably more powerful  for good and for evil.    The absence of any real distinction between the Elohim of different  ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any  sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the  media of communication between them and men. The agents through whom  the lower Elohim are consulted are called necromancers, wizards, and  diviners, and are looked down upon by the prophets and priests of the  higher Elohim; but the \"seer\" [7] connects the two, and they are all  alike in their essential characters of media. The wise woman of Endor  was believed by others, and, I have little doubt, believed herself, to  be able to \"bring up\" whom she would from Sheol, and to be inspired,  whether in virtue of actual possession by the evoked Elohim, or  otherwise, with a knowledge of hidden things, I am unable to see that  Saul's servant took any really different view of Samuel's powers, though  he may have believed that he obtained them by the grace of the higher  Elohim. For when Saul fails to find his father's asses, his servant says  to him--       Behold, there is in this city a man of Elohim, and he is a man     that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass;     now let us go thither; peradventure, he can tell us concerning     our journey whereon we go. Then said Saul to his servant, But     behold if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is     spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the     man of Elohim. What have we? And the servant answered Saul again     and said, Behold I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel     of silver: that will I give to the man of Elohim to tell us our     way. (Beforetime in Israel when a man went to inquire of Elohim,     then he said, Come and let us go to the Seer: for he that is now     called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer [8])     (1 Sam. ix. 6-10).    In fact, when, shortly afterwards, Saul accidentally meets Samuel, he  says, \"Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seer's house is.\" Samuel answers,  \"I am the Seer.\" Immediately afterwards Samuel informs Saul that the  asses are found, though how he obtained his knowledge of the fact is not  stated. It will be observed that Samuel is not spoken of here as, in  any special sense, a seer or prophet of Jahveh, but as a \"man of  Elohim\"--that is to say, a seer having access to the \"spiritual powers,\"  just as the wise woman of Endor might have been said to be a \"woman  of Elohim\"--and the narrator's or editor's explanatory note seems to  indicate that \"Prophet\" is merely a name, introduced later than the time  of Samuel, for a superior kind of \"Seer,\" or \"man of Elohim.\" [9]    Another very instructive passage shows that Samuel was not only  considered to be diviner, seer, and prophet in one, but that he was  also, to all intents and purposes, priest of Jahveh--though, according  to his biographer, he was not a member of the tribe of Levi. At the  outset of their acquaintance, Samuel says to Saul, \"Go up before me into  the high place,\" where, as the young maidens of the city had just before  told Saul, the Seer was going, \"for the people will not eat till he  come, because he doth bless the sacrifice\" (1 Sam. x. 12). The use of  the word \"bless\" here--as if Samuel were not going to sacrifice, but  only to offer a blessing or thanksgiving--is curious. But that Samuel  really acted as priest seems plain from what follows. For he not only  asks Saul to share in the customary sacrificial feast, but he disposes  in Saul's favour of that portion of the victim which the Levitical  legislation, doubtless embodying old customs, recognises as the priest's  special property. [10]    Although particular persons adopted the profession of media between men  and Elohim, there was no limitation of the power, in the view of ancient  Israel, to any special class of the population. Saul inquires of Jahveh  and builds him altars on his own account; and in the very remarkable  story told in the fourteenth chapter of the first book of Samuel  (v. 37-46), Saul appears to conduct the whole process of divination,  although he has a priest at his elbow. David seems to do the same.    Moreover, Elohim constantly appear in dreams--which in old Israel did  not mean that, as we should say, the subject of the appearance \"dreamed  he saw the spirit\"; but that he veritably saw the Elohim which, as a  soul, visited his soul while his body was asleep. And, in the course  of the history of Israel Jahveh himself thus appears to all sorts  of persons, non-Israelites as well as Israelites. Again, the Elohim  possess, or inspire, people against their will, as in the case of Saul  and Saul's messengers, and then these people prophesy--that is to say,  \"rave\"--and exhibit the ungoverned gestures attributed by a later age to  possession by malignant spirits. Apart from other evidence to be adduced  by and by, the history of ancient demonology and of modern revivalism  does not permit me to doubt that the accounts of these phenomena given  in the history of Saul may be perfectly historical.    In the ritual practices, of which evidence is to be found in the books  of Judges and Samuel, the chief part is played by sacrifices, usually  burnt offerings. Whenever the aid of the Elohim of Israel is sought, or  thanks are considered due to him, an altar is built, and oxen, sheep,  and goats are slaughtered and offered up. Sometimes the entire victim  is burnt as a holocaust; more frequently only certain parts, notably  the fat about the kidneys, are burnt on the altar. The rest is properly  cooked; and, after the reservation of a part for the priest, is made the  foundation of a joyous banquet, in which the sacrificer, his family,  and such guests as he thinks fit to invite, participate. [11] Elohim was  supposed to share in the feast, and it has been already shown that that  which was set apart on the altar, or consumed by fire, was spoken of as  the food of Elohim, who was thought to be influenced by the costliness,  or by the pleasant smell, of the sacrifice in favour of the sacrificer.    All this bears out the view that, in the mind of the old Israelite,  there was no difference, save one of degree, between one Elohim and  another. It is true that there is but little direct evidence to show  that the old Israelites shared the widespread belief of their own, and  indeed of all times, that the spirits of the dead not only continue to  exist, but are capable of a ghostly kind of feeding and are grateful for  such aliment as can be assimilated by their attenuated substance, and  even for clothes, ornaments, and weapons. [12] That they were familiar  with this doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the  well-known reference of Ezekiel (xxxii. 27) to the \"mighty that are  fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to [Sheol] hell with  their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads.\"  Perhaps there is a still earlier allusion in the \"giving of food for the  dead\" spoken of in Deuteronomy (xxvi. 14). [13]    It must be remembered that the literature of the old Israelites, as  it lies before us, has been subjected to the revisal of strictly  monotheistic editors, violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry, who  are not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any  obvious evidence, either of the practice under discussion, or of that  ancestor-worship which is so closely related to it, for preservation in  the permanent records of their people.    The mysterious objects known as _Teraphim,_ which are occasionally  mentioned in Judges, Samuel, and elsewhere, however, can hardly be  interpreted otherwise than as indications of the existence both of  ancestor-worship and of image-worship in old Israel. The teraphim  were certainly images of family gods, and, as such, in all probability  represented deceased ancestors. Laban indignantly demands of his  son-in-law, \"Wherefore hast thou stolen my Elohim?\" which Rachel, who  must be assumed to have worshipped Jacob's God, Jahveh, had carried off,  obviously because she, like her father, believed in their divinity. It  is not suggested that Jacob was in any way scandalised by the idolatrous  practices of his favourite wife, whatever he may have thought of her  honesty when the truth came to light; for the teraphim seem to have  remained in his camp, at least until he \"hid\" his strange gods \"under  the oak that was by Shechem\" (Gen. xxxv. 4). And indeed it is open  to question if he got rid of them then, for the subsequent history of  Israel renders it more than doubtful whether the teraphim were regarded  as \"strange gods\" even as late as"]]]
