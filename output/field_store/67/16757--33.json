Words by Miss Chandler. \"Emigrant's Lament,\" arranged by G.W.C.      [Music]    Why did ye wake me from my sleep? It was a dream of bliss,  And ye have torn me from that land, to pine again in this;  Methought, beneath yon whispering tree, that I was laid to rest,  The turf, with all its with'ring flowers, upon my cold heart pressed.    My chains, these hateful chains, were gone--oh, would that I might die,  So from my swelling pulse I could forever cast them by!  And on, away, o'er land and sea, my joyful spirit passed,  Till, 'neath my own banana tree, I lighted down at last.    My cabin door, with all its flowers, was still profusely gay,  As when I lightly sported there, in childhood's careless day!  But trees that were as sapling twigs, with broad and shadowing bough,  Around the well-known threshhold spread a freshening coolness now.    The birds whose notes I used to hear, were shouting on the earth,  As if to greet me back again with their wild strains of mirth;  My own bright stream was at my feet, and how I laughed to lave  My burning lip, and cheek, and brow, in that delicious wave!    My boy, my first-born babe, had died amid his early hours,  And there we laid him to his sleep among the clustering flowers;  Yet lo! without my cottage-door he sported in his glee,  With her whose grave is far from his, beneath yon linden tree.    I sprang to snatch them to my soul; when breathing out my name,  To grasp my hand, and press my lip, a crowd of loved ones came!  Wife, parents, children, kinsmen, friends! the dear and lost ones all,  With blessed words of welcome came, to greet me from my thrall.    Forms long unseen were by my side; and thrilling on my ear,  Came cadences from gentle tones, unheard for many a year;  And on my cheeks fond lips were pressed, with true affection's kiss--  And so ye waked me from my sleep--but 'twas a dream of bliss!          SONG OF THE COFFLE GANG.[2]    [Footnote 2: This song is said to be sung by Slaves, as they are  chained in gangs, when parting from friends for the far off  South--children taken from parents, husbands from wives, and brothers  from sisters.]    Words by the Slaves. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]      See these poor souls from Africa,    Transported to America;  We are stolen, and sold to Georgia, will you go along with me?  We are stolen and sold to Georgia, go sound the jubilee.      See wives and husbands sold apart,    The children's screams!--it breaks my heart;  There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me?  There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.      O gracious Lord! when shall it be,    That we poor souls shall all be free?  Lord, break them Slavery powers--will you go along with me?  Lord, break them Slavery powers, go sound the jubilee.      Dear Lord! dear Lord! when Slavery'll cease,    Then we poor souls can have our peace;  There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me?  There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.          HARK! I HEAR A SOUND OF ANGUISH.    Air, \"Calvary.\"      [Music]    Hark! I hear a sound of anguish    In my own, my native land;  Brethren, doomed in chains to languish,    Lift to heaven the suppliant hand,            And despairing,            And despairing,    Death the end of woe demand.    Let us raise our supplication    For the wretched suffering slave,  All whose life is desolation,    All whose hope is in the grave;            God of mercy!    From thy throne, O hear and save.    Those in bonds we would remember    As if we with them were bound;  For each crushed, each suffering member    Let our sympathies abound,            Till our labors    Spread the smiles of freedom round.    Even now the word is spoken;    \"Slavery's cruel power must cease,  From the bound the chain be broken,    Captives hail the kind release,\"            While in splendor    Comes to reign the Prince of Peace.          BROTHERS BE BRAVE FOR THE PINING SLAVE.    Air--\"Sparkling and Bright.\"      [Music]    Solo.    Heavy and cold in his dungeon hold,    Is the yoke of the oppressor;  Dark o'er the soul is the fell control    Of the stern and dread transgressor.    Chorus.        Oh then come all to bring the thrall        Up from his deep despairing,      And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,        Retake the prey he's tearing:      O then come all to bring the thrall        Up from his deep despairing,      And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,        Retake the prey he's tearing.    Brothers be brave for the pining slave,    From his wife and children riven;  From every vale their bitter wail    Goes sounding up to Heaven.      Then for the life of that poor wife,        And for those children pining;      O ne'er give o'er till the chains no more        Around their limbs are twining.    Gloomy and damp is the low rice swamp,    Where their meagre bands are wasting;  All worn and weak, in vain they seek    For rest, to the cool shade hasting;      For drivers fell, like fiends from hell,        Cease not their savage shouting;      And the scourge's crack, from quivering back,        Sends up the red blood spouting.    Into the grave looks only the slave,    For rest to his limbs aweary;  His spirit's light comes from that night,    To us so dark and dreary.      That soul shall nurse its heavy curse        Against a day of terror,      When the lightning gleam of his wrath shall stream        Like fire, on the hosts of error.    Heavy and stern are the bolts which burn    In the right hand of Jehovah;  To smite the strong red arm of wrong,    And dash his temples over;      Then on amain to rend the chain,        Ere bursts the vallied thunder;      Right onward speed till the slave is freed--        His manacles torn asunder.    E.D.H.          THE QUADROON MAIDEN.    Words by Longfellow. Theme from the Indian Maid.      [Music]    The Slaver in the broad lagoon,    Lay moored with idle sail;  He waited for the rising moon,    And for the evening gale.    The Planter under his roof of thatch,    Smoked thoughtfully and slow;  The Slaver's thumb was on the latch,    He seemed in haste to go.    He said, \"My ship at anchor rides    In yonder broad lagoon;  I only wait the evening tides,    And the rising of the moon.\"    Before them, with her face upraised,    In timid attitude,  Like one half curious, half amazed,    A Quadroon maiden stood.    And on her lips there played a smile    As holy, meek, and faint,  As lights, in some cathedral aisle,    The features of a saint.    \"The soil is barren, the farm is old,\"    The thoughtful Planter said,  Then looked upon the Slaver's gold,    And then upon the maid.    His heart within him was at strife,    With such accursed gains;  For he knew whose passions gave her life,    Whose blood ran in her veins.    But the voice of nature was too weak:    He took the glittering gold!  Then pale as death grew the maiden's cheek,    Her hands as icy cold.    The Slaver led her from the door,    He led her by the hand,  To be his slave and paramour    In a far and distant land.          Domestic Bliss.    BY REV. JAMES GREGG.      Domestic bliss; thou fairest flower    That erst in Eden grew,  Dear relic of the happy bower,    Our first grand parents knew!    We hail thee in the rugged soil    Of this waste wilderness,  To cheer our way and cheat our toil,    With gleams of happiness.    In thy mild light we travel on,    And smile at toil and pain;  And think no more of Eden gone,    For Eden won again.    Such, Emily, the bliss, the joy    By Heaven bestowed on you;  A husband kind, a lovely boy,    A father fond and true.    Religion adds her cheering beams,    And sanctifies these ties;  And sheds o'er all the brighter gleams,    She borrows from the skies.    But ah! reflect; are _all_ thus blest?    Hath home such charms for _all_?  Can such delights as these invest    Foul slavery's wretched thrall?    Can those be happy in these ties    Who wear her galling chain?  Or taste the blessed charities    That in the household reign?    Can those be blest, whose hope, whose life,    Hang on a tyrant's nod;  To whom nor husband, child, nor wife    Are known--yea, scarcely God?    Whose ties may all be rudely riven,    At avarice' fell behest;  Whose only hope of _home_ is heaven,    The grave their only rest.    Oh! think of those, the poor, th' oppressed,    In your full hour of bliss;  Nor e'er from prayer and effort rest,    While earth bears woe like this.          O PITY THE SLAVE MOTHER.    Words from the Liberator. Air, Araby's Daughter.      [Music]    I pity the slave mother, careworn and weary,    Who sighs as she presses her babe to her breast;  I lament her sad fate, all so hopeless and dreary,    I lament for her woes, and her wrongs unredressed.  O who can imagine her heart's deep emotion,    As she thinks of her children about to be sold;  You may picture the bounds of the rock-girdled ocean,    But the grief of that mother can never be known.    The mildew of slavery has blighted each blossom,    That ever has bloomed in her pathway below;  It has froze every fountain that gushed in her bosom,    And chilled her heart's verdure with pitiless woe:  Her parents, her kindred, all crushed by oppression;    Her husband still doomed in its desert to stay;  No arm to protect from the tyrant's aggression--    She must weep as she treads on her desolate way.    O, slave-mother, hope! see--the nation is shaking!    The arm of the Lord is awake to thy wrong!  The slave-holder's heart now with terror is quaking    Salvation and Mercy to Heaven belong!  Rejoice, O rejoice! for the child thou art rearing,    May one day lift up its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22096"],[0,"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children (#3)"],[1,"near,  upon which one of their number sprinkles tobacco. As the smoke rises, a  prayer of thanksgiving is made to the Great Spirit, for causing the  sweet waters of the maple to flow. Then the maple trees are thanked for  their service to men, and protection is asked for the trees during the  coming year.    When \"the leaf of the dogwood is the size of a squirrel's ear,\" it is  planting time. Then an Indian maid goes into the fields and scatters a  few grains of corn, asking the aid of the Great Spirit for the harvest.  The Indian always plants his seed with the growing moon, that it may  grow with the moon.    [Illustration]    The next feast is the Strawberry Feast and Dance.    The strawberry is one of the best gifts of the Great Spirit to his  children. So greatly is it prized that it is thought to grow on the Sky  Road that leads to the Happy Hunting Ground. An Indian who has been very  ill, near death, will say, \"I almost ate strawberries.\"    When the strawberry ripens, the Red Children are happy. They sing their  praises to the Great Spirit and dance with joy. They remember the Little  People who have helped to make the berries beautiful, and they have a  song of praise and dance of thanks for them as well. Without the help of  the Little People, the strawberries would not be so sweet and ripe.    At the time of the Harvest Moon comes the last feast of the summer. This  thanksgiving feast lasts four days. The Indians not only give thanks for  the ripening of the corn, but for every growing thing. Therefore this  feast is longer than the others, since it takes some time to name all  the good gifts of the Great Spirit to the Red Children, and to give  thanks for them all.    There is a story[1] of the corn in which the Spirit of the Corn is a  maiden, not a handsome young chief, as one of the stories claims. This  Corn Maiden was one of three sisters, and was called _Ona tah_.    [Footnote 1: _Myths and Legends of the Iroquois_, by Harriet Maxwell  Converse.]    The three sister vegetables--the corn, the bean, and the squash--were  called the _Di o he ko_, which means \"those we live on,\" since they are  the life-giving vegetables.    These sisters lived together on a hill and were very happy. But one day  _Ona tah_ wandered away in search of dews for her kernels.    The Evil Spirit was watching. He seized _Ona tah_, the Spirit of the  Corn, and sent one of his monsters to blight her fields. The killing  winds swept over the hill, and the spirits of the squash and bean fled  before them.    _Ona tah_ was held for some time a prisoner in the darkness under the  earth, by the Evil Spirit.    [Illustration]    At last a sun ray found her and guided her back to her lost hilltop.  There she found that her sisters had fled. She was alone.    Then _Ona tah_ made a vow to the sun that she would never again leave  her fields. But she sighs for her lost sisters, and mourns the blight  that came upon her beautiful fields. For since the time when _Ona tah_  wandered away and left her fields, the corn has not grown so tall or so  beautiful as once it did.    [Illustration]          A FIREMAKER AND A PEACEMAKER      [Illustration]    In the olden times, tribes of Indians did not always live in one place  as they do now. They sometimes wandered from one valley or woodland to  another. When they came to a sheltered place, where there was pure  running water, and where plenty of game and wood were to be found, they  would build their lodges and light their council fires.    There they might camp for one moon, or for many moons. As long as their  arrows brought game on the hunting trails near, they would not break  camp. But if game grew scarce, or if for any reason they did not like  the camp ground, they would move farther on.    Sometimes they would go several days' journey, before they found a  camping place such as they liked.    The first thing that was done in making a camp was to secure fire and  light the council fire. This fire was always kept burning. It never went  out while they remained.    The Indians loved the fire. It was the gift of the Great Spirit to the  Red Children. It kept them warm and cooked their food by day, and  protected them by night.    A line of fires was kept burning around the camp. This protected the Red  Children from the wild animals, for all animals fear fire, and are  charmed by it. They might prowl and howl all night long outside the fire  ring, but never would they attempt to come within that ring. There the  Indians could sleep in peace, guarded by the spirits of the fire.    [Illustration]    The Indian that could make fire first became a chief and leader. When it  was decided to camp at a certain place, a signal would be given. At this  the young braves would leap into the woods, to see which one first could  bring back fire. Each had his own secret way of making it. Usually a  bowstring was twisted about a fire stick, and the stick was turned  rapidly in a groove. In a few seconds, smoke would rise from the sawdust  that formed. After a little fanning a flame would leap forth.    The Indian whose brain and hand worked swiftest and surest was the  smartest and best man. He became a Firemaker, and was made a chief of  the tribe. He could do something that the rest could not,--at least he  had proved himself to be more skillful. Such a man, it was thought, had  a better understanding of all things, and therefore could tell the rest  of the tribe what ought to be done.    He no longer was just a man who ate and slept, walked and ran. He was a  man with a mind. He could think and could do things. So he became a  Firemaker chief, and he helped the tribe to think and do.    The Iroquois Red Children believe that there are three kinds of men:  those that use the body only; those that use body and mind; and those  that use body, mind, and spirit.    Now it happened that sometimes an Indian grew to be so kind and so  great, that he could not only strike the fire we see, but the fire we do  not see,--the fire of love that burns in the hearts of people.    [Illustration]    When an Indian could strike this kind of fire, and warm the hearts not  only of his own tribe but of all tribes, so that they came to love one  another, he was a great chief, a Peacemaker chief. Such a man would go  from tribe to tribe, teaching the people how they should do, so that all  might live in peace and plenty, like brothers.    To be a Peacemaker was the highest seat an Indian could take. Few  Indians became Peacemaker chiefs, and they were the great men of the  tribe.    Indian women also might become Peacemakers. At one time the Iroquois had  a Peace Wigwam, where all disputes and quarrels were settled.    The most beautiful, just, and fair-minded woman of all the tribes was  chosen to sit in this wigwam. It was her duty to tend the Peace fire,  and to see that it never went out. She also kept a pot of hominy always  steaming over the fire.    If two Indians had a dispute, it was the custom for them to run to the  Peacemaker's wigwam. They entered from opposite sides. Inside the  wigwam, a deerskin curtain separated them from each other.    [Illustration]    The Peacemaker would listen to the grievance of the one and then to that  of the other. Then she would draw aside the curtain, get the enemies  together, and settle the dispute with justice.    The two would then eat of the hominy, and depart in peace,--no longer  enemies, but friends.    No nation could fight another nation without the consent of the  Peacemaker. Because the peacewomen were wise, and just, and kind, and  taught men to love, not fight each other, the Iroquois were for many  years at peace.    But one day, it is said, a Peacewoman proved untrue to her trust. She  thought more of her own happiness than that of the nation.    [Illustration]    This woman was very beautiful, and the people loved her. For some time  she sat in the Peace Wigwam, and tended faithfully the Peace fire.    One day an Oneida and a Cayuga chief fell to quarreling. They sought the  Peace Wigwam. As they entered and saw the young Peacewoman tending the  fire, each thought he had never seen a woman so beautiful.    Into the heart of each there leaped the desire that she might tend his  wigwam fire.    The Peacemaker listened to the quarrel of the young chiefs and settled  it justly. Then each tried to persuade her to leave the Peace fire and  return with him to his lodge. But the Peacemaker said, \"No, I must tend  the fire, it must be kept burning.\" The chiefs departed with heavy  hearts.    But the Oneida chief could not forget the beautiful woman. When a moon  had passed, he returned to the Peace Wigwam. This time he persuaded the  Peacemaker to leave her fire and return with him to sit at his wigwam  door.    The Peace fire flickered and went out. The Iroquois again went on the  warpath, and for many, many moons, they fought and suffered and died.          IROQUOIS WONDER STORIES    [Illustration]          [Illustration]          HOW THE WHITE MAN CAME      Long, long before Columbus came to America, the Red Children were here.  They were the first and only real Americans.    From the Big Sea Water on the east to the Big Sea Water on the west,  ranged these Children of the Sun, as they called themselves.    Happy and free as the sunlight and air about them, they ran through wide  forests all their own, or plied their bark canoes up and down the  streams.    Then the Indian had a dream. This was long before Columbus dreamed his  dream of the Western World.    In his dream the Indian saw a great White Bird coming out of the east.  Its wings were stretched wide to the north and south. With great  strength and speed, it swept toward the setting sun.    In fear and wonder the Indian watched this giant White Bird appear and  disappear. He knew its meaning, and the Indian's heart was sad.    Then the White man came. From the Big Sea Water on the east he came, in"]]]
