How few ever mention, or seem to have even heard the word  \"Reconstruction\"--a word which, in its historical connotation, explains  all!    I should, perhaps, add a word to those Americans who may chance to read  this book. To them, of course, I must offer a somewhat different  apology. I believe that, with all my limitations, I can tell my  fellow-countrymen things about the history of America which they do not  know. It would be absurd effrontery to pretend that I can tell Americans  what they do not know. For them, whatever interest this book may possess  must depend upon the value of a foreigner's interpretation of the facts.  I know that I should be extraordinarily interested in an American's view  of the story of England since the Separation; and I can only hope that  some degree of such interest may attach to these pages in American eyes.    It will be obvious to Americans that in some respects my view of their  history is individual. For instance, I give Andrew Jackson both a  greater place in the development of American democracy and a higher meed  of personal praise than do most modern American historians and writers  whom I have read. I give my judgment for what it is worth. In my view,  the victory of Jackson over the Whigs was the turning-point of American  history and finally decided that the United States should be a democracy  and not a parliamentary oligarchy. And I am further of opinion that,  both as soldier and ruler, \"Old Hickory\" was a hero of whom any nation  might well be proud.    I am afraid that some offence may be given by my portrait of Charles  Sumner. I cannot help it. I do not think that between his admirers and  myself there is any real difference as to the kind of man he was. It is  a kind that some people revere. It is a kind that I detest--absolutely  leprous scoundrels excepted--more than I can bring myself to detest any  other of God's creatures.

The islands on which Columbus first landed and the adjacent  stretch of mainland from Mexico to Patagonia which the Spaniards who  followed him colonized lay outside the territory which is now known as  the United States. Nevertheless the instinct of the American democracy  has always looked back to him as a sort of ancestor, and popular  American tradition conceives of him as in some shadowy fashion a  founder. And that instinct and tradition, like most such national  instincts and traditions, is sound.    In the epoch which most of us can remember pretty vividly--for it came  to an abrupt end less than five years ago--when people were anxious to  prove that everything important in human history had been done by  \"Teutons,\" there was a great effort to show that Columbus was not really  the first European discoverer of America; that that honour belonged  properly to certain Scandinavian sea-captains who at some time in the  tenth or eleventh centuries paid a presumably piratical visit to the  coast of Greenland. It may be so, but the incident is quite irrelevant.  That one set of barbarians from the fjords of Norway came in their  wanderings in contact with another set of barbarians living in the  frozen lands north of Labrador is a fact, if it be a fact, of little or  no historical import. The Vikings had no more to teach the Esquimaux  than had the Esquimaux to teach the Vikings. Both were at that time  outside the real civilization of Europe.    Columbus, on the other hand, came from the very centre of European  civilization and that at a time when that civilization was approaching  the summit of one of its constantly recurrent periods of youth and  renewal. In the North, indeed, what strikes the eye in the fifteenth  century is rather the ugliness of a decaying order--the tortures, the  panic of persecution, the morbid obsession of the _danse macabre_--things  which many think of as Mediaeval, but which belong really only to the  Middle Ages when old and near to death. But all the South was already  full of the new youth of the Renaissance. Boccaccio had lived, Leonardo  was at the height of his glory. In the fields of Touraine was already  playing with his fellows the boy that was to be Rabelais.    Such adventures as that of Columbus, despite his pious intentions with  regard to the Khan of Tartary, were a living part of the Renaissance and  were full of its spirit, and it is from the Renaissance that American  civilization dates. It is an important point to remember about America,  and especially about the English colonies which were to become the  United States, that they have had no memory of the Middle Ages. They had  and have, on the other hand, a real, formative memory of Pagan antiquity,  for the age in which the oldest of them were born was full of enthusiasm  for that memory, while it thought, as most Americans still think, of the  Middle Ages as a mere feudal barbarism.    Youth and adventurousness were not the only notes of the Renaissance,  nor the only ones which we shall see affecting the history of America.  Another note was pride, and with that pride in its reaction against the  old Christian civilization went a certain un-Christian scorn of poverty  and still more of the ugliness and ignorance which go with poverty; and  there reappeared--to an extent at least, and naturally most of all where  the old religion had been completely lost--that naked Pagan repugnance  which almost refused to recognize a human soul in the barbarian. It is  notable that in these new lands which the Renaissance had thrown open to  European men there at once reappears that institution which had once  been fundamental to Europe and which the Faith had slowly and with  difficulty undermined and dissolved--Slavery.    The English colonies in America owe their first origin partly to the  English instinct for wandering and especially for wandering on the sea,  which naturally seized on the adventurous element in the Renaissance as  that most congenial to the national temper, and partly to the secular  antagonism between England and Spain. Spain, whose sovereign then ruled  Portugal and therefore the Portuguese as well as Spanish colonies,  claimed the whole of the New World as part of her dominions, and her  practical authority extended unchallenged from Florida to Cape Horn. It  would have been hopeless for England to have attempted seriously to  challenge that authority where it existed in view of the relative  strength at that time of the two kingdoms; and in general the English  seamen confined themselves to hampering and annoying the Spanish  commerce by acts of privateering which the Spaniards naturally  designated as piracy. But to the bold and inventive mind of the great  Raleigh there occurred another conception. Spain, though she claimed the  whole American continent, had not in fact made herself mistress of all  its habitable parts. North of the rich lands which supplied gold and  silver to the Spanish exchequer, but still well within the temperate  zone of climate, lay great tracts bordering the Atlantic where no  Spanish soldier or ruler had ever set his foot. To found an English  colony in the region would not be an impossible task like the attempt to  seize any part of the Spanish empire, yet it would be a practical  challenge to the Spanish claim. Raleigh accordingly projected, and  others, entering into his plans, successfully planted, an English  settlement on the Atlantic seaboard to the south of Chesapeake Bay  which, in honour of the Queen, was named \"Virginia.\"    In the subsequent history of the English colonies which became American  States we often find a curious and recurrent reflection of their origin.  Virginia was the first of those colonies to come into existence, and we  shall see her both as a colony and as a State long retaining a sort of  primacy amongst them. She also retained, in the incidents of her history  and in the characters of many of her great men, a colour which seems  partly Elizabethan. Her Jefferson, with his omnivorous culture, his love  of music and the arts, his proficiency at the same time in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#3)"],[1," ceases to  grow.    As already noted some perennial grasses have creeping stems and stolons,  while others may have rhizomes. The grass _Cynodon dactylon_ develops  several underground stolons which are covered with white scale leaves  and whose terminal buds are hard and sharp so that they may be able to  make their way through the soil. The rhizomes when continuous and  elongated are usually sympodia formed by the lower portions of the  aerial shoots. The aerial shoot comes into the air and its lower portion  is continued by a branch arising from a lower leaf axil beneath the  soil.    =The leaf.=--Leaves are two-ranked and alternate, and very often they  become crowded at the lower portions of the shoots so as to form basal  tufts, though they are farther apart in the upper portions of these  shoots. Three distinct kinds of leaves are met with in grasses. First,  we have the fully formed foliage leaves so characteristic of grasses.  These are most conspicuous and are formed in large numbers.    The other two kinds of leaves are neither so conspicuous nor so numerous  as the foliage leaves. At the base of shoots occur abortive leaves which  are really rudimentary sheaths. These are called =scales=. The third  kind of leaf is a modified structure called the =prophyll= or  =prophyllum=. (See fig. 12.) It is the first leaf occurring in every  branch on the side next to the main shoot and it is a two-keeled  membranous structure resembling somewhat the palea found in the  spikelets of grasses. The portion of the prophyll between the keels is  concave due to the pressure of the main stem, while the sides beyond the  keels bend forward clasping the stem.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Prophylla.    A. A branch with its prophyllum; B. prophyllum; C. section of the  prophyllum.]    The ordinary foliage leaves of grasses consist of the two parts, the  flat expanded upper portion called the =blade= and the lower part called  the =sheath= that encircles the stem above the node from which it  arises. The leaf-sheaths usually fit close to the stem, but they may  also be loose or even inflated. Though the leaf-sheath surrounds the  internode like a tube, it is not a closed tube. It is really a flat  structure rolled firmly round the stem with one edge overlapping the  other. In most cases it is cylindrical and it may be compressed in a few  cases. Occasionally it may have a prominent ridge or keel down its back.  The sheath may be glabrous or hairy, smooth or striate externally, and  the outer margin is often ciliate. In a few grasses the sheaths become  coloured especially below or on the side exposed to the sun.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Ligules of 1. Oryza sativa; 2. Panicum  javanicum; 3. Andropogon Schoenanthus; 4. A. contortus.]    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Shapes of leaf-blades.    1, 7 and 8. Lanceolate; 3 and 6. lanceolate-linear; 2 and 5. linear; and  4. ovate.]    The =ligule= is a structure peculiar to grasses and it varies very much.  In some grasses it is a distinct membrane narrow or broad, with an even,  truncate or erose margin, or finely ciliate. Very often it is only a  line or fringe of hairs, whilst in some it may be entirely absent as in  the leaves of _Panicum colonum_. When it is a membrane it may be broad  and oblong, ovate and obtuse, or lanceolate and acute. (See fig. 13.)  The function of the ligule is probably to facilitate the shedding of  water which may run down the leaf, and thus lessen the danger of rotting  of the stem which is sure to follow, if the water were to find its way  into the interior of the sheath. Sometimes, in addition to the ligule,  other appendages may be present in grass leaves as in _Oryza sativa_.  Such outgrowths are called =auricles= or =auricular outgrowths=. (See  fig. 13.)    The leaf-blade is well developed in the foliage leaves and in most cases  it follows directly on the sheath. But in bamboos and some species of  Ischaemum there occurs a short petiole or stalk between the leaf-blade  and the sheath. The sheath corresponds morphologically to the leaf base  of a leaf of other flowering plants.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Margins of leaves.    1 and 2. Finely serrate; 3. glandular; 4 and 5. very minutely serrate;  6. very minutely serrate and ciliate.]    In grasses the leaf-blades usually grow more in length than in any other  direction and there is no limit to the length they may attain. Some  grasses have very short leaves, others very long ones. The leaf-blade in  most grasses is more or less of some elongated form, such as linear,  linear-lanceolate, lanceolate, etc. (See fig. 14.) In a few grasses the  leaf-blade is ovate, but this is a rare condition. Therefore, in noting  the general shape of the leaf-blade the relation of the length to the  breadth, the amount of tapering towards the apex and base and the nature  of the apex should be considered.    The veins in the leaf-blade can usually be seen on holding the leaf up  to the light. All the veins run parallel. In most cases the midrib is  prominent and in some cases there may be also a distinct keel. Amongst  the veins running through the leaf-blade some are large and prominent,  while others are small and not conspicuous. On account of this  disparity, very often, ridges and furrows become prominent on the upper  or lower, or on both the surfaces of the leaf-blades. Generally the two  surfaces of the leaf-blade are distinct, and they may be glabrous or  hairy. In most grasses the surfaces are rough or scabrid to the touch  owing to the presence of regular rows of exceedingly fine sharp pointed  minute hairs.    The apex of the blade is generally sharp and pointed, acute or  acuminate, or sometimes it may be drawn to a very fine point by gradual  tapering. Blunt or obtuse tips are not altogether absent, but it is not  a common feature. The leaf-blades in _Panicum colonum_ and in some  species of Andropogon are rounded or obtuse at the apex.    The margins of the leaf-blade are somewhat hyaline and they may be  perfectly even or cut into serrations of fine teeth in various ways.  (See fig. 15.) In addition to these minute teeth, there may be long or  short cilia. Sometimes the margins are glandular as in _Eragrostis  Willdenoviana_ and _Eragrostis major_.    The base of the leaf may be narrower, broader than, or about the same as  the breadth of the leaf-sheath. It may be rounded, amplexicaul or  narrowed. At the base and just above the ligular region there will  always be a white distinct zone in the lamina of all grasses called the  collar. This collar varies in length and breadth according to the  species of grass.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Transverse section of leaf-buds.    A. Conduplicate; 1, 2 and 3. leaf-sheaths; 4 and 5. leaf-blades. B.  Convolute; 1 and 2, leaf-sheaths; 3 and 4. leaf-blades.]    In young shoots all the leaf-blades are usually found folded at the  terminal portions. In most cases the leaf-blade is rolled up inwards  from one end to the other so that one margin is inside and the other  outside. This folding is termed =convolute=. This is the kind of folding  that is found in most grasses. However, there are some grasses such as  _Eleusine aegyptiaca_ and _Chloris barbata_, in which the folding is  different. In these grasses the laminas are folded flat on their midribs  so that each half of the blade is folded flat on the other, the inner  surfaces being in contact. The leaves are said to be =conduplicate= in  this case. When the leaves are conduplicate the shoots are more or less  compressed. (See fig. 16.)          CHAPTER III.    THE INFLORESCENCE AND FLOWER.      The flowers of grasses are reduced to their essential organs, the  stamens and the pistil. The flowers are aggregated together on distinct  shoots constituting the inflorescence of grasses. Sooner or later all  the branches of a grass-plant terminate in inflorescences which usually  stand far above the foliage leaves. As in other flowering plants, in  grasses also different forms of inflorescence are met with. But in  grasses the unit of the inflorescence is the =spikelet= and not the  flower.    The forms of inflorescence usually met with are the spike, raceme and  panicle. When the spikelets are sessile or borne directly along an  elongated axis as in _Enteropogon melicoides_ the inflorescence is a  =spike=. If the spikelets borne by the axis are all stalked, however  short the pedicels may be, it is a =raceme=. It must, however, be  remembered that true spikes are very rare. An inflorescence may appear  to be a spike, but on a close examination it will be seen to consist of  spikelets more or less pedicelled. Such an inflorescence, strictly  speaking, is a =spiciform raceme=. The branches of the inflorescence in  _Paspalum scrobiculatum_ or _Panicum javanicum_ are racemes and the  whole inflorescence is a compound raceme. The inflorescence is a  =panicle= when the spikelets are borne on secondary, tertiary or further  subdivided branches. Panicles differ very much in appearance according  to the relative length and stoutness of the branches. In _Eragrostis  tremula_ the panicle is very diffuse, in _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_ less  so. The panicle in _Sporobolus coromandelianus_ is pyramidal and the  branches are all verticillate, the lower being longer than the upper.  The branches of a panicle are usually loose, spreading or drooping in  most grasses. But in some species of grasses such as _Pennisetum  Alopecuros_ and _Setaria glauca_, the paniculate inflorescences become  so contracted that the pedicels and the short branches are hidden and  the inflorescence appears to be a spike. Such inflorescences as these  are called =spiciform panicles=. The inflorescences in several species  of Andropogon consist of racemes so much modified as to appear exactly  like a spike. What looks like a spike in these cases consists of a  jointed axis and each joint bears a pair of spikelets, one sessile and  the other"]]]
