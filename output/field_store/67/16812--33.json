We were coming  into the bay in the glory of that morning under hangings of amber  and rose and feathery grey. The four-inch gun's crew were in  their places. I stood trying to read the Prayer before Action in  its very small print. I murmured what I was doing to my cheery  colleague, so much more enthusiastic than I was about what seemed  to be coming. Then someone came up and spoke to me. It was surely  my friend from the sand bags. I could see him properly now. He  was surely an officer. He stood up slender and shapely in his  khaki, but he was not wearing a single star or a regimental badge  of any kind. Had he forgotten these in the hurry of this eager  morning? With but a few words, he passed on towards the guns'  crews. Soon our four-inch gun was shaking the ship horribly. We  were shelling a trench that ran up a hillside, they said. I sat  under cover of the bulwark near some kneeling riflemen, far from  enjoying myself. Yet no gun roared back in answer to our own. It  seemed to be one-sided enough, this operation of war.    'It's a fearful weapon,' remarked my colleague rather  complacently, as he paced towards the gun platform. One prayed  for those who were naked to its fearsomeness up on the hill  there, and prayed about Saint Michael's intervention to Saint  Michael's Commander-in-Chief. The long-drawn moments slurred by  us. A bell rang as the ship wound her way in slowly. The mournful  cry of him who took the soundings came again and again. Then we  stopped dead anew, and our gun's mouth roared and flamed.    'Such a crowd of askaris; the hill's black with them!' So the  signalman cried to the doctor, as he sped by on a message. I was  interested in watching the gun-layer as he readjusted the dragon  mouth. But what had my friend of the sand-bags to do with the  matter? He moved among the gun's crew, and none said him nay; his  hands were on the gun after the accredited gunlayer's. We shelled  another position, and then another. Afterwards came a lull, and  some of us hurried up to breakfast.    There was much talk there of the possible or probable slaughter  we had effected. Doubtless the store ship that had followed us  and hung behind us had served us well. Those on shore Had surely  been more disposed to hold to their positions, fearing that she  carried troops, and meant to land them. Now she was steaming  slowly away. How many did our bag amount to? The Intelligence  Officer was sanguine, so was my colleague, but the gunnery  officer was rather pessimistic. 'Two or three of those rounds  went just wrong,' he grunted. 'We've struck a bad day.' After  that the porridge and the bacon and the eggs were done with; we  were soon back at our stations. Once more our gun bombarded. Once  more no answer came. Now occurred the cruise of the motor boat;  the best adventure of the day so far, as it seemed to me.    The boat was lowered, and the shore Maxim mounted in it. Sand  bags were piled up in plenty. A Naval Reserve officer, fair-haired  and young faced, sprang in to join the gun's officer. There was  also a British bluejacket ready to go, and there were African  soldiers and sailors, as well as the two engine-men, English and  Goanese. They were to beat up the river, and hunt down canoes,  should any appear.    My heart thrilled as I uttered God-speed to the Maxim warden. I  think he was unmarried, but his fellow officer was both husband  and father; they might have a fiery time in front. Last my  graceful friend, with no stars or badges on his khaki, slipped  into the boat. He seemed to come and go as he liked, and none  refused his services. The boat hummed away from us, past some  rocks, and round a headland into the unseen. Then our ship  traveled on slowly, before she stopped and fired again. She shot  away many rounds that time. I was sick and weary of the firing as  I sat on the deck by the doctor's cabin. My colleague was much  more alert and cheerful. He had secured a shell-case by the naval  commander's bounty. 'They make such splendid trophies,' he told  me. But I did not covet one much. I thought of how such war  trophies were in demand for Christmas decoration vases in a  church by the lakeside. I also thought of the quite possible  horror and havoc of shattered askaris' bodies that those splendid  trophies might be supposed to have wrought. How one thought  besides of the adventurers in that whizzing motor-boat during  that next half-hour. But as it turned out, according to their  disappointed report, not a shot was fired at them.    'We let fly with the Maxim at some natives and one European on  shore,' the gun-worker shouted, as they drew up at the ship's  side. 'We saw some canoes, three of them. Askaris were in them,  and urging the paddlers on. Then, of all times, the Maxim took it  into its head to jam badly. So we didn't get them.' I happened to  catch my friend in khaki's eye as the other lamented. He looked  quite cheerful about things, while the other went on, 'We'd have  sunk the lot, if it hadn't jammed just then.'    The thought flickered into my mind as to whether anybody was  responsible for that singular coincidence. I looked in my  friend's face with some sort of an uneasy question. But he only  smiled. His face was strangely prepossessing, so entirely  fearless, yet not the least truculent. His brown eyes and boy's  lips answered my question with the most engaging of smiles. Those  brown eyes assorted piquantly with his very fair hair. He had  pushed his white helmet far back on his yellow head. Half an hour  later we were in our action stations once more. Our riflemen were  firing at individual askaris (were they all askaris, and not  unhappy villagers?) who could be descried upon the shore. The  signalman, passing by again, snatched a rifle and fired just  beside me. One of the Maxims meanwhile was working away grimly,  the officer's face was set firm as he steadied his coughing  machine. Then it was that I saw my unattached friend step towards  him, and take up his stand behind him. Ping! A bullet came just  over the gun-director's head. 'That was a near shave,' the  warrant officer told me afterwards. 'Someone aimed too high, or  he'd have got him that worked the gun.'    Yet it was a mystery to me why the bullet did not get that  handsome head behind and above him, the head that I reflected had  doubtless helped to draw the fire so high. He who had exposed  himself came to me untouched. 'It looked near,' he allowed to me  smiling. He stayed by us for the rest of that fell morning. He  smiled, and bade me cheer up, when the naval commander went by;  had he not twitted me for sitting safe under the bulwark and  wincing when the four-inch gun roared? He smiled also a little  ironically when my colleague came up, still fondling his trophy  and dilating on its splendor. Then he smiled again and again as  he moved behind him to and fro on the deck, watching him in the  pitiless firing. He smiled moreover when he moved up to the gun;  he was revising the gunlayer's work now and then, so far as I  could make out his movements. He smiled afterwards when the  Intelligence Officer made such sanguine estimates of the  slaughter we had dealt out to forts and trenches. They were  talking together, he and his comrade of the Maxim gun, discussing  whether the bag was really a big one, the former as glib with the  pros as the latter was with the cons. The tall listener smiled  rather wistfully as he heard them. After the last round from the  six-pounder had been fired, before we went to lunch, he came up  and said farewell to me. 'But I shall see you again on board,  shan't I?' I asked. 'We shan't put you off at the Bay till nearly  sunset, shall we?' 'I may be getting off long before then,' he  said, but he did not explain how. My prayer book had fallen on  the deck, and he picked it up and gave it to me. 'Mind you keep  to your own line,' he said. 'I like that prayer in your prayer  book about Saint Michael. Doubtless he's covered not a few  people's heads in this day of battle, not all of them on the one  side. It's likely enough he has unearthly notions about war, as  he's an unearthly being. Perhaps the dragon he makes war on, war  to the death, is neither England nor Germany, but just the  scrapping between them.'    'What do you mean?' I asked, rather puzzled. Yet he only smiled,  he was not very explicit.    'Oh, by the way,' he said. 'They tell me you've promised to build  a mission church to Saint Michael if you get back to the south  safe and sound.' I wondered afterwards who they were that had  told him.    'Yes, I said, 'and if I don't, the building of it's endowed in my  will.'    'Why not take the shell-cases,' he said, 'if they offer you some?  You needn't use them in your church as altar-vases. They'd  make a splendid trophy under Saint Michael's feet, a gleaming,  sleek-barreled serpent of slaughter, just the sort of dragon for  him to tread, and delight in treading. Good-bye.'    He was gone amongst the sailors, just as the steward called me up  to the cold soup. I saw no more of him on the voyage, nor have I  seen him since that September day. The one or two I asked about  him seemed not to know whom I meant. I have often wondered who he  was since then, and have framed a theory. Perhaps you can guess  what it is without my needing to write it down.        FUEL OF FIRE        I was lucky to get a lift. We had risen before the moon took to  her bed, and the sun had left his. We were driving through green  woodlands when the light grew clear around us. A little while ago  their graceful trees had been ruddy or bronze doubtless. Now it  was the turn of the hill-trees on the great kopje that we passed  within a mile, to grow bronzed and to redden. For the month of  November had only just come in. We outspanned in a valley where  the new green of the grass had come already. No doubt a month ago  it had looked very black and fire-scathed."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#3)"],[1,"or prove the Chymical Theory better than ordinary  Chymists have done, or by enriching us with some of their nobler  secrets to evince that Their art is able to make amends even for the  deficiencies of their Theory: And thus much I shall here make bold to  add, that we shall much undervalue Chymistry, if we imagine, that it  cannot teach us things farr more useful, not only to Physick but to  Philosophy, than those that are hitherto known to vulgar Chymists. And  yet as for inferiour Spagyrists themselves, they have by their labours  deserv'd so well of the Common-wealth of Learning, that methinks 'tis  Pity they should ever misse the Truth which they have so industriously  sought. And though I be no Admirer of the Theorical Part of their Art,  yet my conjectures will much deceive me, if the Practical Part be not  much more cultivated than hitherto it has been, and do not both employ  Philosophy and Philosophers, and help to make men such. Nor would I  that have been diverted by other Studies as well as affairs, be  thought to pretend being a profound Spagyrist, by finding so many  faults in the Doctrine wherein the Generality of Chymists scruples not  to Acquiesce: For besides that 'tis most commonly far easier to frame  Objections against any propos'd_ Hypothesis, _than to propose an_  Hypothesis _not lyable to Objections (besides this I say) 'tis no such  great matter, if whereas Beginners in Chymistry are commonly at once  imbu'd with the Theory and Operations of their profession, I who had  the good Fortune to Learn the Operations from illiterate Persons,  upon whose credit I was not Tempted to take up any opinion about them,  should consider things with lesse prejudice, and consequently with  other Eyes than the Generality of Learners; And should be more  dispos'd to accommodate the_ Phaenomena _that occur'd to me to other  Notions than to those of the Spagyrists. And having at first  entertain'd a suspition That the Vulgar Principles were lesse General  and comprehensive, or lesse considerately Deduc'd from Chymical  Operations, than was believ'd; it was not uneasie for me both to Take  notice of divers_ Phaenomena, _overlook'd by prepossest Persons, that  seem'd not to suite so well with the_ Hermetical _Doctrine; and, to  devise some Experiments likely to furnish me with Objections against  it, not known to many, that having practis'd Chymistry longer  perchance then I have yet liv'd, may have far more Experience, Than I,  of particular processes._    _To conclude, whether the Notions I have propos'd, and the Experiments  I have communicated, be considerable, or not, I willingly leave others  to Judge; and This only I shall say for my Self, That I have  endeavour'd to deliver matters of Fact, so faithfully, that I may as  well assist the lesse skilful Readers to examine the Chymical_  Hypothesis, _as provoke the Spagyrical Philosophers to illustrate it:  which if they do, and that either the Chymical opinion, or the  Peripatetick, or any other Theory of the Elements differing from that  I am most inclin'd to, shall be intelligibly explicated, and duly  prov'd to me; what I have hitherto discours'd will not hinder it from  making a Proselyte of a Person that Loves Fluctuation of Judgment  little enough to be willing to be eas'd of it by any thing but  Error._          PHYSIOLOGICAL    CONSIDERATIONS    Touching    _The experiments wont to be employed to evince either the IV  Peripatetick Elements, or the III Chymical Principles of Mixt Bodies._    Part of the First Dialogue.      I Perceive that divers of my Friends have thought it very strange to  hear me speak so irresolvedly, as I have been wont to do, concerning  those things which some take to be the Elements, and others to be the  Principles of all mixt Bodies. But I blush not to acknowledge that I  much lesse scruple to confess that I Doubt, when I do so, then to  profess that I Know what I do not: And I should have much stronger  Expectations then I dare yet entertain, to see Philosophy solidly  establish't, if men would more carefully distinguish those things that  they know, from those that they ignore or do but think, and then  explicate clearly the things they conceive they understand,  acknowledge ingenuously what it is they ignore, and profess so  candidly their Doubts, that the industry of intelligent persons might  be set on work to make further enquiries, and the easiness of less  discerning Men might not be impos'd on. But because a more particular  accompt will probably be expected of my unsatisfyedness not only with  the Peripatetick, but with the Chymical Doctrine of the Primitive  Ingredients of Bodies: It may possibly serve to satisfy others of the  excusableness of my disatisfaction to peruse the ensuing Relation of  what passed a while since at a meeting of persons of several opinions,  in a place that need not here be named; where the subject whereof we  have been speaking, was amply and variously discours'd of.    It was on one of the fairest dayes of this Summer that the inquisitive  _Eleutherius_ came to invite me to make a visit with him to his friend  _Carneades_. I readily consented to this motion, telling him that if  he would but permit me to go first and make an excuse at a place not  far off, where I had at that hour appointed to meet, but not about a  business either of moment, or that could not well admit of a delay, I  would presently wait on him, because of my knowing _Carneades_ to be  so conversant with nature and with Furnaces, and so unconfin'd to  vulgar Opinions, that he would probably by some ingenious Paradox or  other, give our mindes at least a pleasing Exercise, and perhaps  enrich them with some solid instruction. _Eleutherius_ then first  going with me to the place where my Apology was to be made, I  accompanied him to the lodging of _Carneades_, where when we were  come, we were told by the Servants, that he was retired with a couple  of Friends (whose names they also told us) to one of the Arbours in  his Garden, to enjoy under its coole shades a delightful protection  from the yet troublesome heat of the Sun.    _Eleutherius_ being perfectly acquainted with that Garden immediately  led me to the Arbour, and relying on the intimate familiarity that had  been long cherish'd betwixt him and _Carneades_; in spight of my  Reluctancy to what might look like an intrusion upon his privacy,  drawing me by the hand, he abruptly entered the Arbour, where we found  _Carneades_, _Philoponus_, and _Themistius_, sitting close about a  little round Table, on which besides paper, pen, and inke, there lay  two or three open Books; _Carneades_ appeared not at all troubled at  this surprise, but rising from the Table, received his Friend with  open looks and armes, and welcoming me also with his wonted freedom  and civility, invited us to rest our selves by him, which, as soon as  we had exchanged with his two Friends (who were ours also) the  civilities accustomed on such occasions, we did. And he presently  after we had seated our selves, shutting the Books that lay open, and  turning to us with a smiling countenance seemed ready to begin some  such unconcerning discourse as is wont to pass or rather waste the  time in promiscuous companies.    But _Eleutherius_ guessing at what he meant to do, prevented him by  telling him, I perceive _Carneades_ by the books that you have been  now shutting, and much more by the posture wherein I found Persons  qualifi'd [Errata: so qualify'd] to discourse of serious matters; and  so accustom'd to do it, that you three were before our coming, engag'd  in some Philosophical conference, which I hope you will either  prosecute, and allow us to be partakers of, in recompence of the  freedome we have us'd in presuming to surprise you, or else give us  leave to repair the injury we should otherwise do you, by leaving you  to the freedom we have interrupted, and punishing our selves for our  boldness by depriving our selves of the happiness of your company.  With these last words he and I rose up, as if we meant to be gone, But  _Carneades_ suddenly laying hold on his arme, and stopping him by it,  smileingly told him, We are not so forward to lose good company as you  seem to imagine; especially since you are pleas'd to desire to be  present at what we shall say, about such a Subject as that You found  us considering. For that, being the number of the Elements,  Principles, or Materiall Ingredients of Bodies, is an enquiry whose  truth is of that Importance, and of that Difficulty, that it may as  well deserve as require to be searched into by such skilfull  Indagators of Nature as your selves. And therefore we sent to invite  the bold and acute _Leucippus_ to lend us some light by his Atomical  Paradox, upon which we expected such pregnant hints, that 'twas not  without a great deal of trouble that we had lately word brought us  that he was not to be found; and we had likewise begg'd the Assistance  of your presence and thoughts, had not the messenger we employ'd to  _Leucippus_ inform'd us, that as he was going, he saw you both pass by  towards another part of the Town; And this frustrated expectation of  _Leucippus_ his company, who told me but last night that he would be  ready to give me a meeting where I pleas'd to day, having very long  suspended our conference about the freshly mention'd Subject, it was  so newly begun when you came in, that we shall scarce need to repeat  any thing to acquaint you with what has pass'd betwixt us before your  arrival, so that I cannot but look upon it as a fortunate Accident  that you should come so seasonably, to be not hearers alone, but we  hope Interlocutors at our conference. For we shall not only allow of  your presence at it, but desire your Assistance in it; which I adde  both for other reasons, and because though these learned Gentlemen  (sayes he, turning to his two friends) need not fear to discourse  before any Auditory,"]]]
