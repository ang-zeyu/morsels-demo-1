We will try to learn a little about its wonderful way of working.    In your head is your brain. It is the part of you which thinks.    As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your  most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it  in.    [Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._]    We will call the brain the central telegraph office. Little white cords,  called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body.    A large cord called the spinal cord, lies safely in a bony case made by  the spine, and many nerves branch off from this.    If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on  the nerve telegraph to the brain. It tells that wise thinking part that  your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove.    In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that  move that finger, saying: \"Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take  that poor finger away so that it will not be burned.\"    You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of  messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger  away. But you really could not have pulled it away, unless the brain had  sent word to the muscles to do it.    Now, you know what we mean when we say, \"As quick as thought.\" Surely  nothing could be quicker.    You see that the brain has a great deal of work to do, for it has to  send so many orders.    There are some muscles which are moving quietly and steadily all the  time, though we take no notice of the motion.    You do not have to think about breathing, and yet the muscles work all  the time, moving your chest.    If we had to think about it every time we breathed, we should have no  time to think of any thing else.    There is one part of the brain that takes care of such work for us. It  sends the messages about breathing, and keeps the breathing muscles and  many other muscles faithfully at work. It does all this without our  needing to know or think about it at all.    Do you begin to see that your body is a busy work-shop, where many kinds  of work are being done all day and all night?    Although we lie still and sleep in the night, the breathing must go on,  and so must the work of those other organs that never stop until we  die.      OTHER WORK OF THE NERVES.    The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small  white cords. Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the  messages need never get mixed or confused.    These nerves are very delicate little messengers. They do all the  feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and  many pleasures.    If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache. But if there were  no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food.    If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no  pain. But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid  it on yours.    One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.    Children may say: \"My father and mother take care of me.\" But even while  you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you  but yourselves. The older you grow, the more this care will belong to  you, and to no one else.    Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help  us to be well and happy. Certainly the least we can do is to take care  of them and keep them in good order.      CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.    As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body,  and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself.  If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off  breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead.    But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this  part needs rest.    When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and  other work of the body is going on.    If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it  will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.    If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for  seventy or eighty years without complaining.    The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired  if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of  work.      IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?    Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you!    You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order.  Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is  a poison to hurt, and at last to kill.    It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send  their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not know what he  is about.    Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men  who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about  men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars.    Often these stories end with: \"The person had been drinking.\" When the  nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do  their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference  between a railroad track and a place of safety. The brain receives no  message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is  doing.    You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible  things.    That is true. A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal. But even a  little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves.    A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner. There are  people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor. By  this means, they slowly poison their bodies.    When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less  likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies  with alcohol.    When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the  first questions asked him by the doctor is: \"Do you drink?\"    If he answers \"Yes!\" the next questions are, \"What do you drink?\" and  \"How much?\"    The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the  man has of getting well.    A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would  surely die.      TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.    Why does any one wish to use tobacco?    Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better.    Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better?    If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not  feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer.    If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or  help him out of his trouble.    It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not  tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles.    It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to  be contented with what ought not to content him.    A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did  not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well.    Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise  would be.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. How do the muscles know when to move?              2.

This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is  flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it,  that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.    Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain  water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits.

They fairly  fell backward into their burrows, where they crouched quivering in the  darkest recesses, not daring to show their noses again for hours.    Neither weasel nor wood-mice, nor the chickadees which came to eye him  saucily, seemed to the big ram worth a moment's attention. But when a  porcupine, his quills rattling and bristling till he looked as big  around as a half-bushel basket, strolled aimlessly by, the ram was  interested and rose to his feet. The little, deep-set eyes of the  porcupine passed over him with supremest indifference, and their owner  began to gnaw at the bark of a hemlock sapling which grew at one side  of the rock. To this gnawing he devoted his whole attention, with an  eagerness that would have led one to think he was hungry,--as, indeed,  he was, not having had a full meal for nearly half an hour. The  porcupine, of all nature's children, is the best provided for, having  the food he loves lying about him at all seasons. Yet he is for ever  eating, as if famine were in ambush for him just over the next  hillock.    Seeing the high indifference of this small, bristling stranger, the  ram stepped up and was just about to sniff at him inquiringly. Had he  done so, the result would have been disastrous. He would have got a  slap in the face from the porcupine's active and armed tail; and his  face would have straightway been transformed into a sort of anguished  pincushion, stuck full of piercing, finely barbed quills. He would  have paid dear for his ignorance of woodcraft,--perhaps with the loss  of an eye, or even with starvation from a quill working through into  his gullet. But fortunately for him the ewe understood the  peculiarities of porcupines. Just in time she noted his danger, and  rudely butted him aside. He turned upon her in a fume of amazed  indignation; but in some way she made him understand that the  porcupine was above all law, and not to be trifled with even by the  lords of the wilderness. Very sulkily he lay down again, and the  porcupine went on chiselling hemlock bark, serenely unconscious of the  anger in the inscrutable yellow eyes that watched him from the ram's  black face.    When the shadows grew long and luminous, toward evening, the ram,  following some unexplained instinct, again mounted the topmost point  of Ringwaak, and stood like a statue gazing over the vast,  warm-coloured solitude of his new domain. His yellow eyes were placid  with a great content. A little below him, the white lamb wobbling on  weak legs at her side, the ewe pastured confidently, secure in the  proved prowess of her protector. As the sun dropped below the far-off  western rim of the forest, it seemed as if one wide wave of lucent  rose-violet on a sudden flooded the world. Everything on Ringwaak--the  ram's white fleece, the gray, bleached stumps, the brown hillocks, the  green hollows and juniper clumps and poplar saplings--took on a  palpitating aerial stain. Here and there in the distance the coils of  the river gleamed clear gold; and overhead, in the hollow  amber-and-lilac arch of sky, the high-wandering night-hawks swooped  with the sweet twang of smitten strings.    Down at the foot of the northern slope of Ringwaak lay a dense cedar  swamp. Presently, out from the green fringe of the cedars, a bear  thrust his head and cast a crafty glance about the open. Seeing the  ram on the hilltop and the ewe with her lamb feeding near by, he sank  back noiselessly into the cover of the cedars, and stole around toward  the darkening eastern slope, where a succession of shrubby copses ran  nearly to the top of the hill.    The bear was rank, rusty-coated, old, and hungry; and he loved sheep.  He was an adept in stalking this sweet-fleshed, timorous quarry, and  breaking its neck with a well-directed blow as it dashed past him in a  panic. Emerging from the swamp, he crept up the hill, taking cunning  advantage of every bush, stump, and boulder. For all his awkward  looking bulk, he moved as lightly as a cat, making himself small, and  twisting and flattening and effacing himself; and never a twig was  allowed to snap, or a stone to clatter, under his broad, unerring  feet.    About this time it chanced that the backwoodsman, who had been out  nearly all day hunting for his lost prize, approached the edge of the  forest at the other side of Ringwaak,--and saw the figure of the ram  against the sky. Then, seeing also the ewe with the lamb beside her,  he knew that the game was his.    Below the top of the hill there was not a scrap of cover for a  distance of perhaps twenty paces. The bear crept to the very last  bush, the ram being occupied with the world at a distance, and the ewe  busy at her pasturing. Behind the bush--a thick, spreading  juniper--the bear crouched motionless for some seconds, his little red  eyes aglow, and his jaws beginning to slaver with eagerness. Then  selecting the unconscious ewe, because he knew she was not likely to  desert the lamb, he rushed upon his intended victim.    The ewe, as it chanced, was about thirty-five or forty feet distant  from the enemy, as he lunged out, black and appalling, from behind the  juniper. At the same time the ram was not more than twenty or  twenty-five feet distant, straight above the lamb, in a direction at  right angles to the path of the bear. The ewe looked up with a  startled bleat, wheeled, sprang nimbly before the lamb, and faced her  doom dauntlessly, with lowered head.    [Illustration: \"HE CREPT UP THE HILL.\"]    The ram's mild gaze changed in a flash to one of cold, yellow savagery  at the sight of the great black beast invading his kingdom. Down went  his conquering head. For just a fraction of a second his sturdy body  sagged back, as if he were about to sit down. This, so to speak, was  the bending of the bow. Then he launched himself straight down the  slope, all his strength, his weight, and the force of gravity  combining to drive home that mighty stroke.    The bear had never, in all his experience with sheep, encountered one  whose resistance was worth taking into account. The defiance of the  ewe was less than nothing to him. But as he saw, from the corner of  his eye, the huge bulk plunging down upon him, he hesitated, and half  turned, with great paw upraised for a finishing blow.    He turned not quite in time, however, and his defence was not quite  strenuous enough for the emergency. He struck like lightning, as a  bear always can, but just before the stroke could find its mark the  ram's armed forehead crashed into his ribs. The blow, catching him as  it did, was irresistible. His claws tore off a patch of wool and skin,  and ploughed red furrows across the ram's shoulder,--but the next  instant he was sprawling, his breath jarred from his lungs, against a  stump some ten feet down the slope.    As the bear struggled to his feet, furious but half-daunted with  amazement, the ram danced backward a pace or two on his nimble feet,  as if showing off, and then delivered his second charge. The  bewildered bear was again caught unready, irresolute as to whether he  should fight or flee; and again he was knocked headlong, a yard or two  further down the slope. His was not the dauntless spirit that most of  his kindred would have shown in such a case, and he would willingly  have made his escape at once if he had seen his way quite clear to do  so. But at this moment, while he hesitated, he heard a man's voice  shouting loudly, and saw the tall backwoodsman running toward him up  the hill. This sight turned his alarm into a blind panic. His feet  seemed to acquire wings as he tore madly away among the thickets. When  he was hidden by the leafage, his path could still be followed by the  crashing of dry branches and the clattering of loosened stones.    The woodsman had seen the whole incident, and was wild with enthusiasm  over the prowess of his prize. Bears had been the most dreaded scourge  of the settlement sheep-farmers, but now, as he proudly said to  himself, he had a ram that could \"lick a b'ar silly!\" He bore no  grudge on account of his discomfiture that morning beside the spring,  but rather thought of it with appreciation as a further evidence of  his favourite's cunning and prowess; and he foresaw, with a chuckle,  that there were painful surprises in store for the bears of the  Ringwaak range. He had made a wise purchase indeed when he saved that  splendid beast from the butcher.    Hearing the man's voice, the ram had halted in dismay just when he was  about to charge the bear a third time. He had no mind to go again into  captivity. But, on the other hand, for all his lordliness of spirit,  he felt that the man was his master. At first he lowered his head  threateningly, as if about to attack; but when the backwoodsman  shouted at him there was an authority in those tones which he could  not withstand, and he sullenly drew aside. With a good-natured laugh,  the man picked the lamb up in his arms, whereupon the mother stepped  timidly to his side, evidently having no fear. The man rubbed her nose  kindly, and stroked her ears, and gave her something from his pocket  which she ate greedily; and, as the ram looked on, the anger gradually  faded out from his yellow eyes. At length the man turned and walked  slowly down the hill, carrying the lamb. The ewe followed, crowding as  close to him as she could, and stumbling as she went because her eyes  were fixed upon her little one.    The ram hesitated. He looked at the hillside, the woods, and the sky  beginning to grow chill with the onrush of twilight. Then he looked  at the retreating figures. Suddenly he saw his world growing empty and  desolate. With an anxious bleat he trotted after the ewe, and took his  docile place a few feet behind the man's heels. The man glanced over  his shoulders, and a smile of pleasure softened his rugged face. In a  few moments the little procession disappeared in the woods,"]]]
