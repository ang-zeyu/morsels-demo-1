Wahb  tried to run, but it was no use; the Coyote was soon up with him. Then with  a sudden rush of desperate courage Wahb turned and charged his foe. The  astonished Coyote gave a scared yowl or two, and fled with his tail between  his legs. Thus Wahb learned that war is the price of peace.    But the forage was poor here; there were too many cattle; and Wahb was  making for a far-away pinon woods in the Meteetsee Canyon when he saw a man,  just like the one he had seen on that day of sorrow. At the same moment he  heard a _bang_, and some sage-brush rattled and fell just over his back.  All the dreadful smells and dangers of that day came back to his memory,  and Wahb ran as he never had run before.    He soon got into a gully and followed it into the canyon. An opening between  two cliffs seemed to offer shelter, but as he ran toward it a Range-cow  came trotting between, shaking her head at him and snorting threats against  his life.    He leaped aside upon a long log that led up a bank, but at once a savage  Bobcat appeared on the other end and warned him to go back. It was no time  to quarrel. Bitterly Wahb felt that the world was full of enemies. But he  turned and scrambled up a rocky bank into the pinon woods that border the  benches of the Meteetsee.        [Illustration: \"A SAVAGE BOBCAT ... WARNED HIM TO GO BACK.\"]    The Pine Squirrels seemed to resent his coming, and barked furiously. They  were thinking about their pinon-nuts. They knew that this Bear was coming  to steal their provisions, and they followed him overhead to scold and  abuse him, with such an outcry that an enemy might have followed him by  their noise, which was exactly what they intended.    There was no one following, but it made Wahb uneasy and nervous. So he kept  on till he reached the timber line, where both food and foes were scarce,  and here on the edge of the Mountain-sheep land at last he got a chance to  rest.        [Illustration]              IV      Wahb never was sweet-tempered like his baby sister, and the persecutions by  his numerous foes were making him more and more sour. Why could not they  let him alone in his misery? Why was every one against him? If only he had  his Mother back! If he could only have killed that Blackbear that had  driven him from his woods! It did not occur to him that some day he himself  would be big. And that spiteful Bobcat, that took advantage of him; and  the man that had tried to kill him. He did not forget any of them, and he  hated them all.    Wahb found his new range fairly good, because it was a good nut year. He  learned just what the Squirrels feared he would, for his nose directed him  to the little granaries where they had stored up great quantities of nuts  for winter's use. It was hard on the Squirrels, but it was good luck for  Wahb, for the nuts were delicious food. And when the days shortened and the  nights began to be frosty, he had grown fat and well-favored.    He traveled over all parts of the canyon now, living mostly in the higher  woods, but coming down at times to forage almost as far as the river. One  night as he wandered by the deep water a peculiar smell reached his nose.  It was quite pleasant, so he followed it up to the water's edge. It seemed  to come from a sunken log. As he reached over toward this, there was a  sudden _clank_, and one of his paws was caught in a strong, steel  Beaver-trap.        [Illustration: \"WAHB YELLED AND JERKED BACK.\"]    Wahb yelled and jerked back with all his strength, and tore up the stake  that held the trap. He tried to shake it off, then ran away through the  bushes trailing it. He tore at it with his teeth; but there it hung, quiet,  cold, strong, and immovable. Every little while he tore at it with his  teeth and claws, or beat it against the ground. He buried it in the earth,  then climbed a low tree, hoping to leave it behind; but still it clung,  biting into his flesh. He made for his own woods, and sat down to try to  puzzle it out. He did not know what it was, but his little green-brown eyes  glared with a mixture of pain, fright, and fury as he tried to understand  his new enemy.        [Illustration]    He lay down under the bushes, and, intent on deliberately crushing the  thing, he held it down with one paw while he tightened his teeth on the  other end, and bearing down as it slid away, the trap jaws opened and the  foot was free. It was mere chance, of course, that led him to squeeze both  springs at once. He did not understand it, but he did not forget it, and he  got these not very clear ideas: \"There is a dreadful little enemy that  hides by the water and waits for one. It has an odd smell. It bites one's  paws and is too hard for one to bite. But it can be got off by hard  squeezing.\"    For a week or more the little Grizzly had another sore paw, but it was not  very bad if he did not do any climbing.        [Illustration]    It was now the season when the Elk were bugling on the mountains. Wahb  heard them all night, and once or twice had to climb to get away from one  of the big-antlered Bulls. It was also the season when the trappers were  coming into the mountains, and the Wild Geese were honking overhead. There  were several quite new smells in the woods, too. Wahb followed one of these  up, and it led to a place where were some small logs piled together; then,  mixed with the smell that had drawn him, was one that he hated--he  remembered it from the time when he had lost his Mother. He sniffed about  carefully, for it was not very strong, and learned that this hateful smell  was on a log in front, and the sweet smell that made his mouth water was  under some brush behind. So he went around, pulled away the brush till he  got the prize, a piece of meat, and as he grabbed it, the log in front went  down with a heavy _chock_.    It made Wahb jump; but he got away all right with the meat and some new  ideas, and with one old idea made stronger, and that was, \"When that  hateful smell is around it always means trouble.\"        [Illustration]    As the weather grew colder, Wahb became very sleepy; he slept all day when  it was frosty. He had not any fixed place to sleep in; he knew a number of  dry ledges for sunny weather, and one or two sheltered nooks for stormy  days. He had a very comfortable nest under a root, and one day, as it began  to blow and snow, he crawled into this and curled up to sleep. The storm  howled without. The snow fell deeper and deeper. It draped the pine-trees  till they bowed, then shook themselves clear to be draped anew. It drifted  over the mountains and poured down the funnel-like ravines, blowing off the  peaks and ridges, and filling up the hollows level with their rims. It  piled up over Wahb's den, shutting out the cold of the winter, shutting out  itself: and Wahb slept and slept.        [Illustration]              V      He slept all winter without waking, for such is the way of Bears, and yet  when spring came and aroused him, he knew that he had been asleep a long  time. He was not much changed--he had grown in height, and yet was but  little thinner. He was now very hungry, and forcing his way through the  deep drift that still lay over his den, he set out to look for food.    There were no pinon-nuts to get, and no berries or ants; but Wahb's nose  led him away up the canyon to the body of a winter-killed Elk, where he had  a fine feast, and then buried the rest for future use.        [Illustration]    Day after day he came back till he had finished it. Food was very scarce  for a couple of months, and after the Elk was eaten, Wahb lost all the fat  he had when he awoke. One day he climbed over the Divide into the Warhouse  Valley. It was warm and sunny there, vegetation was well advanced, and he  found good forage. He wandered down toward the thick timber, and soon  smelled the smell of another Grizzly. This grew stronger and led him to a  single tree by a Bear-trail. Wahb reared up on his hind feet to smell this  tree. It was strong of Bear, and was plastered with mud and Grizzly hair  far higher than he could reach; and Wahb knew that it must have been a very  large Bear that had rubbed himself there. He felt uneasy. He used to long  to meet one of his own kind, yet now that there was a chance of it he was  filled with dread.    No one had shown him anything but hatred in his lonely, unprotected life,  and he could not tell what this older Bear might do. As he stood in doubt,  he caught sight of the old Grizzly himself slouching along a hillside,  stopping from time to time to dig up the quamash-roots and wild turnips.    He was a monster. Wahb instinctively distrusted him, and sneaked away  through the woods and up a rocky bluff where he could watch.    Then the big fellow came on Wahb's track and rumbled a deep growl of anger;  he followed the trail to the tree, and rearing up, he tore the bark with  his claws, far above where Wahb had reached. Then he strode rapidly along  Wahb's trail. But the cub had seen enough. He fled back over the Divide  into the Meteetsee Canyon, and realized in his dim, bearish way that he was  at peace there because the Bear-forage was so poor.    As the summer came on, his coat was shed. His skin got very itchy, and he  found pleasure in rolling in the mud and scraping his back against some  convenient tree. He never climbed now: his claws were too long, and his  arms, though growing big and strong, were losing that suppleness of wrist  that makes cub Grizzlies and all Blackbears great climbers. He now dropped  naturally into the Bear habit of seeing how high he could reach with his  nose on the rubbing-post, whenever he was near one.    He may not have noticed it, yet each time he came to a post, after a week  or two away, he could reach higher, for Wahb was growing fast and coming  into his strength.

But Coyote killed the nine brothers and so saved the world from burning  up. But Moon also had nine brothers all made of ice, like himself, and  the Night People almost froze to death. Therefore Coyote went away out  on the eastern edge of the world with his flint-stone knife. He heated  stones to keep his hands warm, and as the Moons arose, he killed one  after another with his flint-stone knife, until he had slain nine of  them. Thus the people were saved from freezing at night.    When it rains, some Indian, sick in heaven, is weeping. Long, long ago,  there was a good young Indian on earth. When he died the Indians wept so  that a flood came upon the earth, and drowned all people except one  couple.          The Creation of the World  Pima (Arizona)    In the beginning there was nothing at all except darkness. All was  darkness and emptiness. For a long, long while, the darkness gathered  until it became a great mass. Over this the spirit of Earth Doctor  drifted to and fro like a fluffy bit of cotton in the breeze. Then Earth  Doctor decided to make for himself an abiding place. So he thought  within himself, \"Come forth, some kind of plant,\" and there appeared the  creosote bush. He placed this before him and set it upright. But it at  once fell over. He set it upright again; again it fell. So it fell until  the fourth time it remained upright. Then Earth Doctor took from his  breast a little dust and flattened it into a cake. When the dust cake  was still, he danced upon it, singing a magic song.    Next he created some black insects which made black gum on the creosote  bush. Then he made a termite which worked with the small earth cake  until it grew very large. As he sang and danced upon it, the flat World  stretched out on all sides until it was as large as it is now. Then he  made a round sky-cover to fit over it, round like the houses of the  Pimas. But the earth shook and stretched, so that it was unsafe. So  Earth Doctor made a gray spider which was to spin a web around the edges  of the earth and sky, fastening them together. When this was done, the  earth grew firm and solid.    Earth Doctor made water, mountains, trees, grass, and weeds-made  everything as we see it now. But all was still inky blackness. Then he  made a dish, poured water into it, and it became ice. He threw this  round block of ice far to the north, and it fell at the place where the  earth and sky were woven together. At once the ice began to gleam and  shine. We call it now the sun. It rose from the ground in the north up  into the sky and then fell back. Earth Doctor took it and threw it to  the west where the earth and sky were sewn together. It rose into the  sky and again slid back to the earth. Then he threw it to the far south,  but it slid back again to the flat earth. Then at last he threw it to  the east. It rose higher and higher in the sky until it reached the  highest point in the round blue cover and began to slide down on the  other side. And so the sun does even yet.    Then Earth Doctor poured more water into the dish and it became ice. He  sang a magic song, and threw the round ball of ice to the north where  the earth and sky are woven together. It gleamed and shone, but not so  brightly as the sun. It became the moon, and it rose in the sky, but  fell back again, just as the sun had done. So he threw the ball to the  west, and then to the south, but it slid back each time to the earth.  Then he threw it to the east, and it rose to the highest point in the  sky-cover and began to slide down on the other side. And so it does even  to-day, following the sun.    But Earth Doctor saw that when the sun and moon were not in the sky, all  was inky darkness. So he sang a magic song, and took some water into his  mouth and blew it into the sky, in a spray, to make little stars. Then  he took his magic crystal and broke it into pieces and threw them into  the sky, to make the larger stars. Next he took his walking stick and  placed ashes on the end of it. Then he drew it across the sky to form  the Milky Way. So Earth Doctor made all the stars.          Spider's Creation  Sia (New Mexico)    In the beginning, long, long ago, there was but one being in the lower  world. This was the spider, Sussistinnako. At that time there were no  other insects, no birds, animals, or any other living creature.    The spider drew a line of meal from north to south and then crossed it  with another line running east and west. On each side of the first line,  north of the second, he placed two small parcels. They were precious but  no one knows what was in them except Spider. Then he sat down near the  parcels and began to sing. The music was low and sweet and the two  parcels accompanied him, by shaking like rattles. Then two women  appeared, one from each parcel.    In a short time people appeared and began walking around. Then animals,  birds, and insects appeared, and the spider continued to sing until his  creation was complete.    But there was no light, and as there were many people, they did not pass  about much for fear of treading upon each other. The two women first  created were the mothers of all. One was named Utset and she as the  mother of all Indians. The other was Now-utset, and she was the mother  of all other nations. While it was still dark, the spider divided the  people into clans, saying to some, \"You are of the Corn clan, and you  are the first of all.\" To others he said, \"You belong to the Coyote  clan.\" So he divided them into their clans, the clans of the Bear, the  Eagle, and other clans.    After Spider had nearly created the earth, Ha-arts, he thought it would  be well to have rain to water it, so he created the Cloud People, the  Lightning People, the Thunder People, and the Rainbow People, to work  for the people of Ha-arts, the earth. He divided this creation into six  parts, and each had its home in a spring in the heart of a great  mountain upon whose summit was a giant tree. One was in the spruce tree  on the Mountain of the North; another in the pine tree on the Mountain  of the West; another in the oak tree on the Mountain of the South; and  another in the aspen tree on the Mountain of the East; the fifth was on  the cedar tree on the Mountain of the Zenith; and the last in an oak on  the Mountain of the Nadir.    The spider divided the world into three parts: Ha-arts, the earth;  Tinia, the middle plain; and Hu-wa-ka, the upper plain. Then the spider  gave to these People of the Clouds and to the rainbow, Tinia, the middle  plain.    Now it was still dark, but the people of Ha-arts made houses for  themselves by digging in the rocks and the earth. They could not build  houses as they do now, because they could not see. In a short time Utset  and Now-utset talked much to each other, saying,    \"We will make light, that our people may see. We cannot tell the people  now, but to-morrow will be a good day and the day after to-morrow will  be a good day,\" meaning that their thoughts were good. So they spoke  with one tongue. They said, \"Now all is covered with darkness, but after  a while we will have light.\"    Then these two mothers, being inspired by Sussistinnako, the spider,  made the sun from white shell, turkis, red stone, and abalone shell.  After making the sun, they carried him to the east and camped there,  since there were no houses. The next morning they climbed to the top of  a high mountain and dropped the sun down behind it. After a time he  began to ascend. When the people saw the light they were happy.    When the sun was far off, his face was blue; as he came nearer, the face  grew brighter. Yet they did not see the sun himself, but only a large  mask which covered his whole body.    The people saw that the world was large and the country beautiful. When  the two mothers returned to the village, they said to the people, \"We  are the mothers of all.\"    The sun lighted the world during the day, but there was no light at  night. So the two mothers created the moon from a slightly black stone,  many kinds of yellow stone, turkis, and a red stone, that the world  might be lighted at night. But the moon travelled slowly and did not  always give light. Then the two mothers created the Star People and made  their eyes of sparkling white crystal that they might twinkle and  brighten the world at night. When the Star People lived in the lower  world they were gathered into beautiful groups; they were not scattered  about as they are in the upper world.          The Gods and the Six Regions    In ancient times, Po-shai-an-ki-a, the father of the sacred bands, or  tribes, lived with his followers in the City of Mists, the Middle Place,  guarded by six warriors, the prey gods. Toward the North, he was guarded  by Long Tail, the mountain lion; West by Clumsy Foot, the bear; South by  Black-Mark Face, the badger; East by Hang Tail, the wolf; above by White  Cap, the eagle; below by Mole.    So when he was about to go forth into the world, he divided the earth  into six regions: North, the Direction of the Swept or Barren Plains;  West, the Direction of the Home of the Waters; South, the Place of the  Beautiful Red; East, the Direction of the Home of Day; upper regions,  the Direction of the Home of the High; lower regions, the Direction of  the Home of the Low.          How Old Man Above Created the World  Shastika (Cal.)    Long, long ago, when the world was so new that even the stars were dark,  it was very, very flat. Chareya, Old Man Above, could not see through  the dark to the new, flat earth. Neither could he step down to it  because it was so far below him. With a large stone he bored a hole in  the sky. Then through the hole he pushed down masses of ice and snow,  until a great pyramid rose from the plain. Old Man Above climbed down  through the hole he had made in the sky, stepping from cloud to cloud,  until he could put his foot on top the mass of ice and snow. Then with  one"]]]
