(#3)"],[1,"that no such division of a man into two parts is permissible, save in  Christianity (the body and the soul), but that outside purely religious  spheres it is utterly unwarrantable. There can be no such strange divorce  between a bloom and the plant on which it blows, and has a black woman  ever been known to give birth to a white child?    Wagner, as Nietzsche tells us on p. 19, \"was something complete, he was a  typical _decadent_ in whom every sign of 'free will' was lacking, in whom  every feature was necessary.\" Wagner, allow me to add, was a typical  representative of the nineteenth century, which was the century of  contradictory values, of opposed instincts, and of every kind of inner  disharmony. The genuine, the classical artists of that period, such men as  Heine, Goethe, Stendhal, and Gobineau, overcame their inner strife, and  each succeeded in making a harmonious whole out of himself--not indeed  without a severe struggle; for everyone of them suffered from being the  child of his age, _i.e._, a decadent. The only difference between them and  the romanticists lies in the fact that they (the former) were conscious of  what was wrong with them, and possessed the will and the strength to  overcome their illness; whereas the romanticists chose the easier  alternative--namely, that of shutting their eyes on themselves.    \"I am just as much a child of my age as Wagner--_i.e._, I am a _decadent_,\"  says Nietzsche. \"The only difference is that I recognised the fact, that I  struggled against it\"(6)    What Wagner did was characteristic of all romanticists and contemporary  artists: he drowned and overshouted his inner discord by means of  exuberant pathos and wild exaltation. Far be it from me to value Wagner's  music _in extenso_ here--this is scarcely a fitting opportunity to do  so;--but I think it might well be possible to show, on purely psychological  grounds, how impossible it was for a man like Wagner to produce real art.  For how can harmony, order, symmetry, mastery, proceed from uncontrolled  discord, disorder, disintegration, and chaos? The fact that an art which  springs from such a marshy soil may, like certain paludal plants, be  \"wonderful,\" \"gorgeous,\" and \"overwhelming,\" cannot be denied; but true  art it is not. It is so just as little as Gothic architecture is,--that  style which, in its efforts to escape beyond the tragic contradiction in  its mediaeval heart, yelled its hysterical cry heavenwards and even melted  the stones of its structures into a quivering and fluid jet, in order to  give adequate expression to the painful and wretched conflict then raging  between the body and the soul.    That Wagner, too, was a great sufferer, there can be no doubt; not,  however, a sufferer from strength, like a true artist, but from  weakness--the weakness of his age, which he never overcame. It is for this  reason that he should be rather pitied than judged as he is now being  judged by his German and English critics, who, with thoroughly neurotic  suddenness, have acknowledged their revulsion of feeling a little too  harshly.    \"I have carefully endeavoured not to deride, or deplore, or detest{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}\" says  Spinoza, \"but to understand\"; and these words ought to be our guide, not  only in the case of Wagner, but in all things.    Inner discord is a terrible affliction, and nothing is so certain to  produce that nervous irritability which is so trying to the patient as  well as to the outer world, as this so-called spiritual disease. Nietzsche  was probably quite right when he said the only real and true music that  Wagner ever composed did not consist of his elaborate arias and overtures,  but of ten or fifteen bars which, dispersed here and there, gave  expression to the composer's profound and genuine melancholy. But this  melancholy had to be overcome, and Wagner with the blood of a _cabotin_ in  his veins, resorted to the remedy that was nearest to hand--that is to say,  the art of bewildering others and himself. Thus he remained ignorant about  himself all his life; for there was, as Nietzsche rightly points out (p.  37, _note_), not sufficient pride in the man for him to desire to know or  to suffer gladly the truth concerning his real nature. As an actor his  ruling passion was vanity, but in his case it was correlated with a  semi-conscious knowledge of the fact that all was not right with him and  his art. It was this that caused him to suffer. His egomaniacal behaviour  and his almost Rousseauesque fear and suspicion of others were only the  external manifestations of his inner discrepancies. But, to repeat what I  have already said, these abnormal symptoms are not in the least  incompatible with Wagner's music, they are rather its very cause, the root  from which it springs.    In reality, therefore, Wagner the man and Wagner the artist were  undoubtedly one, and constituted a splendid romanticist. His music as well  as his autobiography are proofs of his wonderful gifts in this direction.  His success in his time, as in ours, is due to the craving of the modern  world for actors, sorcerers, bewilderers and idealists who are able to  conceal the ill-health and the weakness that prevail, and who please by  intoxicating and exalting. But this being so, the world must not be  disappointed to find the hero of a preceding age explode in the next. It  must not be astonished to find a disparity between the hero's private life  and his \"elevating\" art or romantic and idealistic gospel. As long as  people will admire heroic attitudes more than heroism, such  disillusionment is bound to be the price of their error. In a truly great  man, life-theory and life-practice, if seen from a sufficiently lofty  point of view, must and do always agree, in an actor, in a romanticist, in  an idealist, and in a Christian, there is always a yawning chasm between  the two, which, whatever well-meaning critics may do, cannot be bridged  posthumously by acrobatic feats _in psychologicis_.    Let anyone apply this point of view to Nietzsche's life and theory. Let  anyone turn his life inside out, not only as he gives it to us in his  _Ecce Homo_, but as we find it related by all his biographers, friends and  foes alike, and what will be the result? Even if we ignore his works--the  blooms which blowed from time to time from his life--we absolutely cannot  deny the greatness of the man's _private practice_, and if we fully  understand and appreciate the latter, we must be singularly deficient in  instinct and in _flair_ if we do not suspect that some of this greatness  is reflected in his life-task.

THE CASE OF WAGNER: A MUSICIAN'S PROBLEM      A LETTER FROM TURIN, MAY 1888    \"RIDENDO DICERE SEVERUM.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}\"          Preface      I am writing this to relieve my mind. It is not malice alone which makes  me praise Bizet at the expense of Wagner in this essay. Amid a good deal  of jesting I wish to make one point clear which does not admit of levity.  To turn my back on Wagner was for me a piece of fate, to get to like  anything else whatever afterwards was for me a triumph. Nobody, perhaps,  had ever been more dangerously involved in Wagnerism, nobody had defended  himself more obstinately against it, nobody had ever been so overjoyed at  ridding himself of it. A long history!--Shall I give it a name?--If I were a  moralist, who knows what I might not call it! Perhaps a piece of  _self-mastery_.--But the philosopher does not like the moralist, neither  does he like high-falutin' words.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    What is the first and last thing that a philosopher demands of himself? To  overcome his age in himself, to become \"timeless.\" With what then does the  philosopher have the greatest fight? With all that in him which makes him  the child of his time. Very well then! I am just as much a child of my age  as Wagner--_i.e._, I am a decadent. The only difference is that I  recognised the fact, that I struggled against it. The philosopher in me  struggled against it.    My greatest preoccupation hitherto has been the problem of _decadence_,  and I had reasons for this. \"Good and evil\" form only a playful  subdivision of this problem. If one has trained one's eye to detect the  symptoms of decline, one also understands morality,--one understands what  lies concealed beneath its holiest names and tables of values: _e.g._,  _impoverished_ life, the will to nonentity, great exhaustion. Morality  _denies_ life.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} In order to undertake such a mission I was obliged to  exercise self-discipline:--I had to side against all that was morbid in  myself including Wagner, including Schopenhauer, including the whole of  modern _humanity_.--A profound estrangement, coldness and soberness towards  all that belongs to my age, all that was contemporary: and as the highest  wish, Zarathustra's eye, an eye which surveys the whole  phenomenon--mankind--from an enormous distance,--which looks down upon  it.--For such a goal--what sacrifice would not have been worth while? What  \"self-mastery\"! What \"self-denial\"!    The greatest event of my life took the form of a _recovery_. Wagner  belongs only to my diseases.    Not that I wish to appear ungrateful to this disease. If in this essay I  support the proposition that Wagner is _harmful_, I none the less wish to  point out unto whom, in spite of all, he is indispensable--to the  philosopher. Anyone else may perhaps be able to get on without Wagner: but  the philosopher is not free to pass him by. The philosopher must be the  evil conscience of his age,--but to this end he must be possessed of its  best knowledge. And what better guide, or more thoroughly efficient  revealer of the soul, could be found for the labyrinth of the modern  spirit than Wagner?

Mrs. Darnell had  been Miss Mary Reynolds, the daughter of an auctioneer and estate agent  in Notting Hill, and Aunt Marian was her mother's sister, who was  supposed rather to have lowered herself by marrying a coal merchant, in  a small way, at Turnham Green. Marian had felt the family attitude a  good deal, and the Reynoldses were sorry for many things that had been  said, when the coal merchant saved money and took up land on building  leases in the neighbourhood of Crouch End, greatly to his advantage, as  it appeared. Nobody had thought that Nixon could ever do very much; but  he and his wife had been living for years in a beautiful house at  Barnet, with bow-windows, shrubs, and a paddock, and the two families  saw but little of each other, for Mr. Reynolds was not very prosperous.  Of course, Aunt Marian and her husband had been asked to Mary's wedding,  but they had sent excuses with a nice little set of silver apostle  spoons, and it was feared that nothing more was to be looked for.  However, on Mary's birthday her aunt had written a most affectionate  letter, enclosing a cheque for a hundred pounds from 'Robert' and  herself, and ever since the receipt of the money the Darnells had  discussed the question of its judicious disposal. Mrs. Darnell had  wished to invest the whole sum in Government securities, but Mr. Darnell  had pointed out that the rate of interest was absurdly low, and after a  good deal of talk he had persuaded his wife to put ninety pounds of the  money in a safe mine, which was paying five per cent. This was very  well, but the remaining ten pounds, which Mrs. Darnell had insisted on  reserving, gave rise to legends and discourses as interminable as the  disputes of the schools.    At first Mr. Darnell had proposed that they should furnish the 'spare'  room. There were four bedrooms in the house: their own room, the small  one for the servant, and two others overlooking the garden, one of which  had been used for storing boxes, ends of rope, and odd numbers of 'Quiet  Days' and 'Sunday Evenings,' besides some worn suits belonging to Mr.  Darnell which had been carefully wrapped up and laid by, as he scarcely  knew what to do with them. The other room was frankly waste and vacant,  and one Saturday afternoon, as he was coming home in the 'bus, and while  he revolved that difficult question of the ten pounds, the unseemly  emptiness of the spare room suddenly came into his mind, and he glowed  with the idea that now, thanks to Aunt Marian, it could be furnished. He  was busied with this delightful thought all the way home, but when he  let himself in, he said nothing to his wife, since he felt that his idea  must be matured. He told Mrs. Darnell that, having important business,  he was obliged to go out again directly, but that he should be back  without fail for tea at half-past six; and Mary, on her side, was not  sorry to be alone, as she was a little behindhand with the household  books. The fact was, that Darnell, full of the design of furnishing the  spare bedroom, wished to consult his friend Wilson, who lived at  Fulham, and had often given him judicious advice as to the laying out of  money to the very best advantage. Wilson was connected with the Bordeaux  wine trade, and Darnell's only anxiety was lest he should not be at  home.    However, it was all right; Darnell took a tram along the Goldhawk Road,  and walked the rest of the way, and was delighted to see Wilson in the  front garden of his house, busy amongst his flower-beds.    'Haven't seen you for an age,' he said cheerily, when he heard Darnell's  hand on the gate; 'come in. Oh, I forgot,' he added, as Darnell still  fumbled with the handle, and vainly attempted to enter. 'Of course you  can't get in; I haven't shown it you.'    It was a hot day in June, and Wilson appeared in a costume which he had  put on in haste as soon as he arrived from the City. He wore a straw hat  with a neat pugaree protecting the back of his neck, and his dress was a  Norfolk jacket and knickers in heather mixture.    'See,' he said, as he let Darnell in; 'see the dodge. You don't _turn_  the handle at all. First of all push hard, and then pull. It's a trick  of my own, and I shall have it patented. You see, it keeps undesirable  characters at a distance--such a great thing in the suburbs. I feel I  can leave Mrs. Wilson alone now; and, formerly, you have no idea how she  used to be pestered.'    'But how about visitors?' said Darnell. 'How do they get in?'    'Oh, we put them up to it. Besides,' he said vaguely, 'there is sure to  be somebody looking out. Mrs. Wilson is nearly always at the window.  She's out now; gone to call on some friends. The Bennetts' At Home day,  I think it is. This is the first Saturday, isn't it? You know J. W.  Bennett, don't you? Ah, he's in the House; doing very well, I believe.  He put me on to a very good thing the other day.'    'But, I say,' said Wilson, as they turned and strolled towards the front  door, 'what do you wear those black things for? You look hot. Look at  me. Well, I've been gardening, you know, but I feel as cool as a  cucumber. I dare say you don't know where to get these things? Very few  men do. Where do you suppose I got 'em?'    'In the West End, I suppose,' said Darnell, wishing to be polite.    'Yes, that's what everybody says. And it is a good cut. Well, I'll tell  you, but you needn't pass it on to everybody. I got the tip from  Jameson--you know him, \"Jim-Jams,\" in the China trade, 39 Eastbrook--and  he said he didn't want everybody in the City to know about it. But just  go to Jennings, in Old Wall, and mention my name, and you'll be all  right. And what d'you think they cost?'    'I haven't a notion,' said Darnell, who had never bought such a suit in  his life.    'Well, have a guess.'    Darnell regarded Wilson gravely.    The jacket hung about his body like a sack, the knickerbockers drooped  lamentably over his calves, and in prominent positions the bloom of the  heather seemed about to fade and disappear.    'Three pounds, I suppose, at least,' he said at length.    'Well, I asked Dench, in our place, the other day, and he guessed four  ten, and his father's got something to do with a big business in Conduit  Street. But I only gave thirty-five and six. To measure? Of course; look  at the cut, man.'    Darnell was astonished at so low a price.    'And, by the way,' Wilson went on, pointing to his new brown boots, 'you  know where to go for shoe-leather? Oh, I thought everybody was up to  that! There's only one place. \"Mr. Bill,\" in Gunning Street,--nine and  six.'    They were walking round and round the garden, and Wilson pointed out the  flowers in the beds and borders. There were hardly any blossoms, but  everything was neatly arranged.    'Here are the tuberous-rooted Glasgownias,' he said, showing a rigid row  of stunted plants; 'those are Squintaceae; this is a new introduction,  Moldavia Semperflorida Andersonii; and this is Prattsia.'    'When do they come out?' said Darnell.    'Most of them in the end of August or beginning of September,' said  Wilson briefly. He was slightly annoyed with himself for having talked  so much about his plants, since he saw that Darnell cared nothing for  flowers; and, indeed, the visitor could hardly dissemble vague  recollections that came to him; thoughts of an old, wild garden, full of  odours, beneath grey walls, of the fragrance of the meadowsweet beside  the brook.    'I wanted to consult you about some furniture,' Darnell said at last.  'You know we've got a spare room, and I'm thinking of putting a few  things into it. I haven't exactly made up my mind, but I thought you  might advise me.'    'Come into my den,' said Wilson. 'No; this way, by the back'; and he  showed Darnell another ingenious arrangement at the side door whereby a  violent high-toned bell was set pealing in the house if one did but  touch the latch. Indeed, Wilson handled it so briskly that the bell rang  a wild alarm, and the servant, who was trying on her mistress's things  in the bedroom, jumped madly to the window and then danced a hysteric  dance. There was plaster found on the drawing-room table on Sunday  afternoon, and Wilson wrote a letter to the 'Fulham Chronicle,'  ascribing the phenomenon 'to some disturbance of a seismic nature.'    For the moment he knew nothing of the great results of his contrivance,  and solemnly led the way towards the back of the house. Here there was a  patch of turf, beginning to look a little brown, with a background of  shrubs. In the middle of the turf, a boy of nine or ten was standing all  alone, with something of an air.    'The eldest,' said Wilson. 'Havelock. Well, Lockie, what are ye doing  now? And where are your brother and sister?'    The boy was not at all shy. Indeed, he seemed eager to explain the  course of events.    'I'm playing at being Gawd,' he said, with an engaging frankness. 'And  I've sent Fergus and Janet to the bad place. That's in the shrubbery.  And they're never to come out any more. And they're burning for ever and  ever.'    'What d'you think of that?' said Wilson admiringly. 'Not bad for a  youngster of nine, is it? They think a lot of him at the Sunday-school.  But come into my den.'    The den was an apartment projecting from the back of the house. It had  been designed as a back kitchen and washhouse, but Wilson had draped the  'copper' in art muslin and had boarded over the sink, so that it served  as a workman's bench.    'Snug, isn't it?' he said, as he pushed forward one of the two wicker  chairs. 'I think out things here, you know; it's quiet. And what about  this furnishing? Do you want to do the thing on a grand scale?'    'Oh, not at all. Quite the reverse. In fact, I don't know whether the  sum at our disposal will be sufficient. You see the spare room is ten  feet by twelve, with a western exposure, and I thought if we _could_  manage it, that it would seem"]]]
