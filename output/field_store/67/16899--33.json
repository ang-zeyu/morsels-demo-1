In the untried recklessness of twenty  untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to  Plainfield. The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly  live afterward.           *       *       *       *       *    Some days later a young man stepped from the C.P.R. train at  Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place  boasted. After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could  direct him to \"The Evergreens.\"    Caleb Williams looked at his guest in bewilderment. \"Never heerd o'  such a place,\" he said.    \"It is the name of Mr. Conway's estate--Mr. James Conway,\" explained  John Lincoln.    \"Oh, Jim Conway's place!\" said Caleb. \"Didn't know that was what he  called it. Sartin I kin tell you whar' to find it. You see that road  out thar'? Well, just follow it straight along for a mile and a half  till you come to a blacksmith's forge. Jim Conway's house is just this  side of it on the right--back from the road a smart piece and no other  handy. You can't mistake it.\"    John Lincoln did not expect to mistake it, once he found it; he knew  by heart what it appeared like from Sidney's description: an old  stately mansion of mellowed brick, covered with ivy and set back from  the highway amid fine ancestral trees, with a pine-grove behind it, a  river to the left, and a harbour beyond.    He strode along the road in the warm, ruddy sunshine of early evening.  It was not a bad-looking road at all; the farmsteads sprinkled along  it were for the most part snug and wholesome enough; yet somehow it  was different from what he had expected it to be. And there was no  harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible. Had the hotel-keeper made a  mistake? Perhaps he had meant some other James Conway.    Presently he found himself before the blacksmith's forge. Beside it  was a rickety, unpainted gate opening into a snake-fenced lane  feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces. It ran down a  bare hill, crossed a little ravine full of young white-stemmed  birches, and up another bare hill to an equally bare crest where a  farmhouse was perched--a farmhouse painted a stark, staring yellow and  the ugliest thing in farmhouses that John Lincoln had ever seen, even  among the log shacks of the west. He knew now that he had been  misdirected, but as there seemed to be nobody about the forge he  concluded that he had better go to the yellow house and inquire  within. He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that  spanned the brook. Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles.    Lincoln opened it, or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted  withes which secured it, when he was suddenly arrested by the  apparition of a girl, who flashed around the curve of young birch  beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said John Lincoln courteously, dropping the gate  and lifting his hat. \"I am looking for the house of Mr. James  Conway--'The Evergreens.' Can you direct me to it?\"    \"That is Mr. James Conway's house,\" said the girl, with the tragic air  and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her  hand toward the yellow nightmare above them.    \"I don't think he can be the one I mean,\" said Lincoln perplexedly.  \"The man I am thinking of has a niece, Miss Richmond.\"    \"There is no other James Conway in Plainfield,\" said the girl. \"This  is his place--nobody calls it 'The Evergreens' but myself. I am Sidney  Richmond.\"    For a moment they looked at each other across the gate, sheer  amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute. Sidney, burning  with shame, saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look  upon--tall, clean-limbed, broad-shouldered, with clear-cut bronzed  features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man.  John Lincoln, among all his confused sensations, was aware that this  slim, agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he  ever had seen, so lithe was her figure, so glossy and dark and silken  her bare, wind-ruffled hair, so big and brown and appealing her eyes,  so delicately oval her flushed cheeks. He felt that she was frightened  and in trouble, and he wanted to comfort and reassure her. But how  could she be Sidney Richmond?    \"I don't understand,\" he said perplexedly.    \"Oh!\" Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest.  \"No, and you never will understand--I can't make you understand.\"    \"I don't understand,\" said John Lincoln again. \"Can you be Sidney  Richmond--the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years?\"    \"I am.\"    \"Then, those letters--\"    \"Were all lies,\" said Sidney bluntly and desperately. \"There was  nothing true in them--nothing at all. This is my home. We are poor.  Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination.\"    \"Then why did you write them?\" he asked blankly. \"Why did you deceive  me?\"    \"Oh, I didn't mean to deceive you! I never thought of such a thing.  When you asked me to write to you I wanted to, but I didn't know what  to write about to a stranger. I just couldn't write you about my life  here, not because it was hard, but it was so ugly and empty. So I  wrote instead of the life I wanted to live--the life I did live in  imagination. And when once I had begun, I had to keep it up. I found  it so fascinating, too! Those letters made that other life seem real  to me. I never expected to meet you. These last four days since your  letter came have been dreadful to me. Oh, please go away and forgive  me if you can! I know I can never make you understand how it came  about.\"    Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white  bark of the birch tree behind her. It was worse than she had even  thought it would be. He was so handsome, so manly, so earnest-eyed!  Oh, what a friend to lose!    John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her. There was a great  tenderness in his face, mingled with a little kindly, friendly  amusement.    \"Please don't distress yourself so, Sidney,\" he said, unconsciously  using her Christian name. \"I think I do understand. I'm not such a  dull fellow as you take me for. After all, those letters were  true--or, rather, there was truth in them. You revealed yourself more  faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow  outward life.\"    Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him, a  little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe. This young man was  certainly good at understanding. \"You--you'll forgive me then?\" she  stammered.    \"Yes, if there is anything to forgive. And for my own part, I am glad  you are not what I have always thought you were. If I had come here  and found you what I expected, living in such a home as I expected, I  never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have  come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters  have been the things most eagerly looked forward to. I should have  come this evening and spent an hour or so with you, and then have gone  away on the train tomorrow morning, and that would have been all.    \"But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl, much like my  sisters at home, except that she is a great deal cleverer. And as a  result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every  day, if you will let me. And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to  stop off at Plainfield again for another week, and then I shall tell  you something more--something it would be a little too bold to say  now, perhaps, although I could say it just as well and truly. All this  if I may. May I, Sidney?\"    He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face. Sidney felt a  new, curious, inexplicable thrill at her heart. \"Oh, yes.--I suppose  so,\" she said shyly.    \"Now, take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane,\"  said John Lincoln in satisfied tone.          An Adventure on Island Rock      \"Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield?\" asked Aunt  Kate, as Uncle Richard came to dinner.    \"Bob Marks,\" said Uncle Richard briefly. \"I've sold Laddie to him.\"    Ernest Hughes, the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle \"boarded and  kept\" for the chores he did, suddenly stopped eating.    \"Oh, Mr. Lawson, you're not going to sell Laddie?\" he cried chokily.    Uncle Richard stared at him. Never before, in the five years that  Ernest had lived with him, had the quiet little fellow spoken without  being spoken to, much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle  Richard might do.    \"Certainly I am,\" answered the latter curtly. \"Bob offered me twenty  dollars for the dog, and he's coming after him next week.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Lawson,\" said Ernest, rising to his feet, his small, freckled  face crimson. \"Oh, don't sell Laddie! _Please_, Mr. Lawson, don't sell  him!\"    \"What nonsense is this?\" said Uncle Richard sharply. He was a man who  brooked no opposition from anybody, and who never changed his mind  when it was once made up.    \"Don't sell Laddie!\" pleaded Ernest miserably. \"He is the only friend  I've got. I can't live if Laddie goes away. Oh, don't sell him, Mr.  Lawson!\"    \"Sit down and hold your tongue,\" said Uncle Richard sternly. \"The dog  is mine, and I shall do with him as I think fit. He is sold, and that  is all there is about it. Go on with your dinner.\"    But Ernest for the first time did not obey. He snatched his cap from  the back of his chair, dashed it down over his eyes, and ran from the  kitchen with a sob choking his breath. Uncle Richard looked angry, but  Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him.    \"Don't be vexed with the boy, Richard,\" she said. \"You know he is very  fond of Laddie. He's had to do with him ever since he was a pup, and  no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him. I'm rather sorry  myself that you have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#3)"],[1,"ucily.    I had on a particularly fetching gown and knew I was looking my best.  Jack, however, looked me over with his head on one side.    \"Well, I don't know, Kitty,\" he said slowly. \"That is a stunning sort  of dress you have on--not so pretty, though, as that old blue muslin  you used to wear last summer--and your hair is pretty good. But you  look rather disdainful and, after all, I believe I prefer Thrush Hill  Kitty.\"    How like Jack that was. He never thought me really pretty, and he is  too honest to pretend he does.    But I didn't care. I just laughed, and we sat down together and had a  long, delightful, chummy talk.    Jack told me all the Valleyfield gossip, not forgetting to mention  that Mary Carter was going to be married to a minister in June. Jack  didn't seem to mind it a bit, so I guess he couldn't have been  particularly interested in Mary.    In due time Alicia sailed in. I suppose she had found out from Bessie  who my caller was, and felt rather worried over the length of our  tete-a-tete.    She greeted Jack very graciously, but with a certain polite  condescension of which she is past mistress. I am sure Jack felt it,  for, as soon as he decently could, he got up to go. Alicia asked him  to remain to dinner.    \"We are having a few friends to dine with us, but it is quite an  informal affair,\" she said sweetly.    I felt that Jack glanced at me for the fraction of a second. But I  remembered that Gus Sinclair was coming too, and I did not look at  him.    Then he declined quietly. He had a business engagement, he said.    I suppose Alicia had noticed that look at me, for she showed her  claws.    \"Don't forget to call any time you are in Montreal,\" she said more  sweetly than ever. \"I am sure Katherine will always be glad to see any  of her old friends, although some of her new ones _are_ proving very  absorbing--one, in especial. Don't blush, Katherine, I am sure Mr.  Willoughby won't tell any tales out of school to your old Valleyfield  friends.\"    I was not blushing, and I was furious. It was really too bad of  Alicia, although I don't see why I need have cared.    Alicia kept her eye on us both until Jack was fairly gone. Then she  remarked in the patronizing tone which I detest:    \"Really, Katherine, Jack Willoughby has developed into quite a  passable-looking fellow, although he is rather shabby. But I suppose  he is poor.\"    \"Yes,\" I answered curtly, \"he is poor, in everything except youth and  manhood and goodness and truth! But I suppose those don't count for  anything.\"    Whereupon Alicia lifted her eyebrows and looked me over.    Just at dusk a box arrived with Jack's compliments. It was full of  lovely white carnations, and must have cost the extravagant fellow  more than he has any business to waste on flowers. I was beast enough  to put them on when I went down to listen to another man's  love-making.    This evening I sparkled and scintillated with unusual brilliancy, for  Jack's visit and my consequent crossing of swords with Alicia had  produced a certain elation of spirits. When Gus Sinclair was leaving  he asked if he might see me alone tomorrow afternoon.    I knew what that meant, and a cold shiver went up and down my  backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--_his_  neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three  o'clock.    Alicia had noticed our aside--when did anything ever escape her?--and  when he was gone she asked, significantly, what secret he had been  telling me.    \"He wants to see me alone tomorrow afternoon. I suppose you know what  that means, Alicia?\"    \"Ah,\" purred Alicia, \"I congratulate you, my dear.\"    \"Aren't your congratulations a little premature?\" I asked coldly. \"I  haven't accepted him yet.\"    \"But you will?\"    \"Oh, certainly. Isn't it what we've schemed and angled for? I'm very  well satisfied.\"    And so I am. But I wish it hadn't come so soon after Jack's visit,  because I feel rather upset yet. Of course I like Gus Sinclair very  much, and I am sure I shall be very fond of him.    Well, I must go to bed now and get my beauty sleep. I don't want to be  haggard and hollow-eyed at that important interview tomorrow--an  interview that will decide my destiny.           *       *       *       *       *                                       Thrush Hill, May 6, 18--.    Well, it did decide it, but not exactly in the way I anticipated. I  can look back on the whole affair quite calmly now, but I wouldn't  live it over again for all the wealth of Ind.    That day when Gus Sinclair came I was all ready for him. I had put on  my very prettiest new gown to do honour to the occasion, and Alicia  smilingly assured me I was looking very well.    \"And _so_ cool and composed. Will you be able to keep that up? Don't  you really feel a little nervous, Katherine?\"    \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"I suppose I ought to be, according to  traditions, but I never felt less flustered in my life.\"    When Bessie brought up Gus Sinclair's card Alicia dropped a pecky  little kiss on my cheek, and pushed me toward the door. I went down  calmly, although I'll admit that my heart _was_ beating wildly. Gus  Sinclair was plainly nervous, but I was composed enough for both. You  would really have thought that I was in the habit of being proposed to  by a millionaire every day.    \"I suppose you know what I have come to say,\" he said, standing before  me, as I leaned gracefully back in a big chair, having taken care that  the folds of my dress fell just as they should.    And then he proceeded to say it in a rather jumbled-up fashion, but  very sincerely.    I remember thinking at the time that he must have composed the speech  in his head the night before, and rehearsed it several times, but was  forgetting it in spots.    When he ended with the self-same question that Jack had asked me three  months before at Thrush Hill he stopped and took my hands.    I looked up at him. His good, homely face was close to mine, and in  his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.    I opened my mouth to say yes.    And then there came over me in one rush the most awful realization of  the sacrilege I was going to commit.    I forgot everything except that I loved Jack Willoughby, and that I  could never, never marry anybody in the world except him.    Then I pulled my hands away and burst into hysterical, undignified  tears.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Sinclair. \"I did not mean to startle  you. Have I been too abrupt? Surely you must have known--you must have  expected--\"    \"Yes--yes--I knew,\" I cried miserably, \"and I intended right up to  this very minute to marry you. I'm so sorry--but I can't--I can't.\"    \"I don't understand,\" he said in a bewildered tone. \"If you expected  it, then why--why--don't you care for me?\"    \"No, that's just it,\" I sobbed. \"I don't love you at all--and I do  love somebody else. But he is poor, and I hate poverty. So I refused  him, and I meant to marry you just because you are rich.\"    Such a pained look came over his face. \"I did not think this of you,\"  he said in a low tone.    \"Oh, I know I have acted shamefully,\" I said. \"You can't think any  worse of me than I do of myself. How you must despise me!\"    \"No,\" he said, with a grim smile, \"if I did it would be easier for me.  I might not love you then. Don't distress yourself, Katherine. I do  not deny that I feel greatly hurt and disappointed, but I am glad you  have been true to yourself at last. Don't cry, dear.\"    \"You're very good,\" I answered disconsolately, \"but all the same the  fact remains that I have behaved disgracefully to you, and I know you  think so. Oh, Mr. Sinclair, please, please, go away. I feel so  miserably ashamed of myself that I cannot look you in the face.\"    \"I am going, dear,\" he said gently. \"I know all this must be very  painful to you, but it is not easy for me, either.\"    \"Can you forgive me?\" I said wistfully.    \"Yes, my dear, completely. Do not let yourself be unhappy over this.  Remember that I will always be your friend. Goodbye.\"    He held out his hand and gave mine an earnest clasp. Then he went  away.    I remained in the drawing-room, partly because I wanted to finish out  my cry, and partly because, miserable coward that I was, I didn't dare  face Alicia. Finally she came in, her face wreathed with anticipatory  smiles. But when her eyes fell on my forlorn, crumpled self she fairly  jumped.    \"Katherine, what is the matter?\" she asked sharply. \"Didn't Mr.  Sinclair--\"    \"Yes, he did,\" I said desperately. \"And I've refused him. There now,  Alicia!\"    Then I waited for the storm to burst. It didn't all at once. The shock  was too great, and at first quite paralyzed my half-sister.    \"Katherine,\" she gasped, \"are you crazy? Have you lost your senses?\"    \"No, I've just come to them. It's true enough, Alicia. You can scold  all you like. I know I deserve it, and I won't flinch. I did really  intend to take him, but when it came to the point I couldn't. I didn't  love him.\"    Then, indeed, the storm burst. I never saw Alicia so angry before, and  I never got so roundly abused. But even Alicia has her limits, and at  last she grew calmer.    \"You have behaved disgracefully,\" she concluded. \"I am disgusted with  you. You have encouraged Gus Sinclair markedly right along, and now  you throw him over like this. I never dreamed that you were capable of  such unwomanly behaviour.\"    \"That's a hard word, Alicia,\" I protested feebly.    She dealt me a withering glance. \"It does not begin to be as hard as  your shameful conduct merits. To think of losing a fortune like that  for the sake of sentimental folly! I didn't think you were such a  consummate fool.\"    \"I suppose you absorbed all the sense of our family,\" I said drearily.  \"There now, Alicia, do leave me alone. I'm down in the very depths  already.\"    \"What do you mean to do now?\" said Alicia scornfully. \"Go back to  Valleyfield"]]]
