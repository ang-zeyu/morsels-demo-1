These faults are found to a much smaller degree  in her miscellaneous poems. Her sonnets, here printed for the first  time, seem to me to be of great beauty, and her longer piece entitled  \"Our Casuarina Tree,\" needs no apology for its rich and mellifluous  numbers.    It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have lost  in the premature death of Toru Dutt. Literature has no honours which  need have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one,  and in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm, had produced  so much of lasting worth. And her courage and fortitude were worthy of  her intelligence. Among \"last words\" of celebrated people, that which  her father has recorded, \"It is only the physical pain that makes me  cry,\" is not the least remarkable, or the least significant of strong  character. It was to a native of our island, and to one ten years senior  to Toru, to whom it was said, in words more appropriate, surely, to her  than to Oldham,        Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,      Still showed a quickness, and maturing time      But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.    That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an  English poet, and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same  be said. When the history of the literature of our country comes to be  written, there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile  exotic blossom of song.                                                          EDMUND W. GOSSE.   1881.          ANCIENT BALLADS OF HINDUSTAN.          I.    SAVITRI.      PART I.        Savitri was the only child        Of Madra's wise and mighty king;      Stern warriors, when they saw her, smiled,        As mountains smile to see the spring.      Fair as a lotus when the moon        Kisses its opening petals red,      After sweet showers in sultry June!        With happier heart, and lighter tread,      Chance strangers, having met her, past,        And often would they turn the head      A lingering second look to cast,        And bless the vision ere it fled.        What was her own peculiar charm?        The soft black eyes, the raven hair,      The curving neck, the rounded arm,        All these are common everywhere.      Her charm was this--upon her face        Childlike and innocent and fair,      No man with thought impure or base        Could ever look;--the glory there,      The sweet simplicity and grace,        Abashed the boldest; but the good      God's purity there loved to trace,        Mirrored in dawning womanhood.        In those far-off primeval days        Fair India's daughters were not pent      In closed zenanas. On her ways        Savitri at her pleasure went      Whither she chose,--and hour by hour        With young companions of her age,      She roamed the woods for fruit or flower,        Or loitered in some hermitage,      For to the Munis gray and old        Her presence was as sunshine glad,      They taught her wonders manifold        And gave her of the best they had.        Her father let her have her way        In all things, whether high or low;      He feared no harm; he knew no ill        Could touch a nature pure as snow.      Long childless, as a priceless boon        He had obtained this child at last      By prayers, made morning, night, and noon        With many a vigil, many a fast;      Would Shiva his own gift recall,        Or mar its perfect beauty ever?--      No, he had faith,--he gave her all        She wished, and feared and doubted never.        And so she wandered where she pleased        In boyish freedom. Happy time!      No small vexations ever teased,        Nor crushing sorrows dimmed her prime.      One care alone, her father felt--        Where should he find a fitting mate      For one so pure?--His thoughts long dwelt        On this as with his queen he sate.      \"Ah, whom, dear wife, should we select?\"        \"Leave it to God,\" she answering cried,      \"Savitri, may herself elect        Some day, her future lord and guide.\"        Months passed, and lo, one summer morn        As to the hermitage she went      Through smiling fields of waving corn,        She saw some youths on sport intent,      Sons of the hermits, and their peers,        And one among them tall and lithe      Royal in port,--on whom the years        Consenting, shed a grace so blithe,      So frank and noble, that the eye        Was loth to quit that sun-browned face;      She looked and looked,--then gave a sigh,        And slackened suddenly her pace.        What was the meaning--was it love?        Love at first sight, as poets sing,      Is then no fiction? Heaven above        Is witness, that the heart its king      Finds often like a lightning flash;        We play,--we jest,--we have no care,--      When hark a step,--there comes no crash,--        But life, or silent slow despair.      Their eyes just met,--Savitri past        Into the friendly Muni's hut,      Her heart-rose opened had at last--        Opened no flower can ever shut.        In converse with the gray-haired sage        She learnt the story of the youth,      His name and place and parentage--        Of royal race he was in truth.      Satyavan was he hight,--his sire        Dyoumatsen had been Salva's king,      But old and blind, opponents dire        Had gathered round him in a ring      And snatched the sceptre from his hand;        Now,--with his queen and only son      He lived a hermit in the land,        And gentler hermit was there none.        With many tears was said and heard        The story,--and with praise sincere      Of Prince Satyavan; every word        Sent up a flush on cheek and ear,      Unnoticed. Hark! The bells remind        'Tis time to go,--she went away,      Leaving her virgin heart behind,        And richer for the loss. A ray,      Shot down from heaven, appeared to tinge        All objects with supernal light,      The thatches had a rainbow fringe,        The cornfields looked more green and bright.        Savitri's first care was to tell        Her mother all her feelings new;      The queen her own fears to dispel        To the king's private chamber flew.      \"Now what is it, my gentle queen,        That makes thee hurry in this wise?\"      She told him, smiles and tears between,        All she had heard; the king with sighs      Sadly replied:--\"I fear me much!        Whence is his race and what his creed?      Not knowing aught, can we in such        A matter delicate, proceed?\"        As if the king's doubts to allay,        Came Narad Muni to the place      A few days after. Old and gray,        All loved to see the gossip's face,      Great Brahma's son,--adored of men,        Long absent, doubly welcome he      Unto the monarch, hoping then        By his assistance, clear to see.      No god in heaven, nor king on earth,        But Narad knew his history,--      The sun's, the moon's, the planets' birth        Was not to him a mystery.        \"Now welcome, welcome, dear old friend,        All hail, and welcome once again!\"      The greeting had not reached its end,        When glided like a music-strain      Savitri's presence through the room.--        \"And who is this bright creature, say,      Whose radiance lights the chamber's gloom--        Is she an Apsara or fay?\"      \"No son thy servant hath, alas!        This is my one,--my only child;\"--      \"And married?\"--\"No.\"--\"The seasons pass,        Make haste, O king,\"--he said, and smiled.        \"That is the very theme, O sage,        In which thy wisdom ripe I need;      Seen hath she at the hermitage        A youth to whom in very deed      Her heart inclines.\"--\"And who is he?\"        \"My daughter, tell his name and race,      Speak as to men who best love thee.\"        She turned to them her modest face,      And answered quietly and clear.--        \"Ah, no! ah, no!--It cannot be--      Choose out another husband, dear,\"--        The Muni cried,--\"or woe is me!\"        \"And why should I? When I have given        My heart away, though but in thought,      Can I take back? Forbid it, Heaven!        It were a deadly sin, I wot.      And why should I? I know no crime        In him or his.\"--\"Believe me, child,      My reasons shall be clear in time,        I speak not like a madman wild;      Trust me in this.\"--\"I cannot break        A plighted faith,--I cannot bear      A wounded conscience.\"--\"Oh, forsake        This fancy, hence may spring despair.\"--        \"It may not be.\"--The father heard        By turns the speakers, and in doubt      Thus interposed a gentle word,--        \"Friend should to friend his mind speak out,      Is he not worthy? tell us.\"--\"Nay,        All worthiness is in Satyavan,      And no one can my praise gainsay:        Of solar race--more god than man!      Great Soorasen, his ancestor,        And Dyoumatsen his father blind      Are known to fame: I can aver        No kings have been so good and kind.\"        \"Then where, O Muni, is the bar?        If wealth be gone, and kingdom lost,      His merit still remains a star,        Nor melts his lineage like the frost.      For riches, worldly power, or rank        I care not,--I would have my son      Pure, wise, and brave,--the Fates I thank        I see no hindrance, no, not one.\"      \"Since thou insistest, King, to hear        The fatal truth,--I tell you,--I,      Upon this day as rounds the year        The young Prince Satyavan shall die.\"        This was enough. The monarch knew        The future was no sealed book      To Brahma's son. A clammy dew        Spread on his brow,--he gently took      Savitri's palm in his, and said:        \"No child can give away her hand,      A pledge is nought unsanctioned;        And here, if right I understand,      There was no pledge at all,--a thought,        A shadow,--barely crossed the mind--     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#3)"],[1,"should be fitted with casters, making it easy to remove it to  the center of the room where it can be approached on all sides, as will  often be necessary. The double top, drawers, and shelf should be a part  of the larger table also. Usually the table is kept in front of the  window with tool racks and shelves for small articles each side of the  same where they can easily be reached.    For preparing and mounting all small and medium size specimens I would  advise the following list of tools. They will enable the worker to care  for any of our native birds, quadrupeds up to the coyote, and any of our  game heads, fur rugs, etc.        1 small skinning knife      1 medium skinning knife      1 larger skinning knife      1 pair scissors, fine points      1 pair shears, heavy, short      2 pairs flat nose pliers, large and small.      1 pair side or end cutters    [Illustration: HOME MADE TOOLS.

(6) (7) Stuffers (heavy wire.)]        1 pair fine forceps, 5 or 6 inch      2 flat files, large and small      1 adjustable tool handle, assorted tools, awls.      2 pinking irons, 3/4 and 1-1/2 inch      Needles, assortment of cloth and glovers      Oilstone    If it is capable of taking and holding a good edge the small blade of a  pocket knife is equal to a surgeon's scalpel and a sharp shoe or paring  knife, ground to the proper shape, is a nice medium size for skinning or  trimming skins. A hunting or butcher knife is sufficient for the largest  size. A few carpenter's tools are necessary and a complete set does not  come amiss if much large work is attempted.    We must have:        Handsaw      Hatchet      Hammer      Bit brace      Assortment, drills and bits, 1/2 in. and less.      Drawshave      Screwdriver      Small grindstone or corundum wheel      Chisels, two or three sizes      1 wood rasp      1 cabinet rasp      1 chopping block, made of a section of        hardwood log    If large animals are to be mounted we will need in addition some iron  working tools, such as        Set of taps and dies 1/4 to 1 in.      Monkey wrench      Hack saw      Tanner's knives, 1 or more    A combination vise and anvil will be needed in any case as well as some  miscellaneous tools:        Fur comb, coarse and fine combined      Paint, wax, and varnish brushes      Foot rule      Tape measure      Putty knife      Pointing trowel      Skin scraper    and some stuffing and modelling tools which you can make yourself. The  list of materials seems like a long one, but many are inexpensive and  others are used only in some small amounts, so the aggregate cost is  small.

The permanent mounts are treated of elsewhere.    In ordering glass eyes it is often best to get them in the clear glass  iris with black pupil so they may be given any color desired by painting  the backs with tube colors, afterward protecting the paint with varnish.  In this way a small stock will answer for many varieties. The plain  black eye which is the least expensive can be used for many of the  smaller birds and mammals, but should never be when the iris of the eye  has any distinct tint. Do not make the mistake of ordering an assortment  of \"off\" sizes and colors, that is those which are seldom called for.  Aim to have those on hand for which you will have the most frequent use,  the exceptions can be quickly had by parcel post. There is more demand  for eyes of some shade of yellow or brown than any other colors,  probably.    All birds have the round pupil. Elongated pupils are suitable for horned  game and the cat tribe, irregular pupils fish, and the veined iris for  dogs, wolves and foxes. Suitable sizes for some species of birds are as  follows:      Number  3 to  5   Sparrows generally.    Number  5 to  7   Robin, blue jay, flicker.    Number  7 to  9   The smaller hawks and herons,                      nearly all the ducks.    Number 10 to 12   The smaller owls, the wild goose.    Number 12 to 14   The larger hawks and herons.    Number 15         Screech owl, eagles.    Number 17         Barred owl.    Number 19 or 20   Snowy owl and great horned owl.    [Illustration: GLASS EYES FOR ANIMALS, BIRDS, FISH.]    Size of eyes for quadrupeds:      Number  7 or  8   Mink, skunk, red squirrel.    Number 10 to 12   Gray and fox squirrel, wood                      chuck, raccoon and opossum.    Number 12 to 14   Rabbit, small dogs, house cat.    Number 15 to 17   Jack rabbit, fox, medium size                      dogs, wild cat, black bear.    Number 18         Large dog, wolf, lynx, and grizzly bear.    Number 20 to 22   Puma, jaguar, small deer.    Number 23 to 24   Large deer, tiger.    Number 25 to 27   Moose, elk, caribou, horse, cow, lion.    [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES.]    [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES (Style 1)]    Of wire the following sizes are suitable for  birds:      Number  6         Pelican.    Number  7         Wild turkey, swan.    Number  8         Eagles.    Number  9         Loon, goose, large herons.    Number 10         Seagull, large ducks, hawks,                      owls, and fish hawk.    Number 11 or 12   Medium size ducks, herons, and similar.    Number 13 or 14   Small ducks and grouse.    Number 15         Small herons, and medium owls.    Number 16         Doves, small owls.    Number 17 or 18   Bob white, jay, robin, snipe.    Number 19         Blackbird, waxwing, oriole.    Number 20         Bluebird, cardinal.    Number 21 to 24   Warblers, wrens, titmouse, finches.    Number 26         North American humming bird.    For quadrupeds:      Number  7         Wild cat.    Number  8         Foxes.    Number 10         Raccoon, wood chuck.    Number 11         Skunk, opossum.    Number 12 or 13   Muskrat, rabbit.    Number 14 or 15   Mink, large squirrels.    Number 17 or 18   Weasel, bull frog, and small squirrels.    These sizes are approximate, varying with size of the individual  specimen and the required attitude wanted. For instance, a bird mounted  with wings spread would be better for a large size wire than if in a  resting position. An animal crouched does not require as heavy supports  as one upright or in action. It is best to give the specimen the benefit  of the doubt, as nothing is more disastrous than to have an otherwise  well mounted subject sag down and spoil the entire effect from lack of  sufficient mechanical support. The best wire for this purpose is  annealed, galvanized iron. Larger animals require Norway iron rod in the  following sizes:        1/4 in.   Coyote, setter dog.     5/16 in.   Wolf, puma.      3/8 in.   Medium deer.      1/2 in.   Caribou and large deer.      3/4 in.   Moose, elk.    A large earthen jar or two will hold sufficient skin pickle for small  animals. For large animals or great numbers of small ones a tank or  barrel. Keep such jars or barrels covered to prevent evaporation. With  dry arsenic and alum, arsenical solution, formaldehyde for an emergency  and plenty of salt, even a beginner should be able to save almost  anything that falls into his clutches.    There are numbers of reliable dealers in tools and supplies for the  taxidermist and a perusal of their catalogs will be helpful, among the  number being James P. Babbitt, 192 Hodges Ave., Taunton, Mass. Ready to  use head forms, pinked rug and robe trimming, artificial tongues and ear  forms, and even paper head and neck forms for the mounting of large game  heads are some of the time and labor saving supplies they list. If you  cannot attain to these, emergency supplies can be had of the dealer in  hardware and dry goods, and one who cares for the art will rise superior  to the material at his hand. What you \"stuff 'em with\" is of small  consequence provided you use brains in the job. I have seen an elk head  stuffed with old clothes with the bottoms of pop bottles for eyes, but  would advise some other filling if possible.          CHAPTER III.    PRESERVATIVE PREPARATIONS, FORMULAS, ETC.      Probably arsenic in some form has been, and will continue to be the  leading taxidermic preservative, or rather, insect deterrent. Many  people are shy of handling this, but with reasonable care the use of  arsenic is perfectly safe. Always keep poisons well labeled and out of  the way of children. Nine children out of ten would never think of  sampling them, but the tenth might prove the fatal exception.    There is far less danger to the operator in handling the needful amount  of poisons than in endeavoring to save some rare but over-ripe subject.  In many years' use of arsenic, dry, in wet solution, and in soap, I have  received nothing more serious than an occasional sore finger.
