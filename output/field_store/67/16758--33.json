For that reason I turned away from you this evening when  you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of  surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my  identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. As to  Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which  I needed. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had  hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous  members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for  two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa  and spending some days with the head Llama. You may have read of the  remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure  that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your  friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a  short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum, the results of  which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France I  spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I  conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier, in the South of France. Having  concluded this to my satisfaction, and learning that only one of my  enemies was now left in London, I was about to return when my movements  were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery,  which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to  offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to  London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into  violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my  papers exactly as they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson, that  at two o'clock to-day I found myself in my old arm-chair in my own old  room, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in  the other chair which he has so often adorned.\"    Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April  evening--a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had  it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and  the keen, eager face, which I had never thought to see again. In some  manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was  shown in his manner rather than in his words. \"Work is the best antidote  to sorrow, my dear Watson,\" said he, \"and I have a piece of work for us  both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will  in itself justify a man's life on this planet.\" In vain I begged him  to tell me more. \"You will hear and see enough before morning,\" he  answered. \"We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice  until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the  empty house.\"    It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated  beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of  adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent. As the  gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features I saw that  his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. I  knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle  of criminal London, but I was well assured from the bearing of this  master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one, while the  sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded  little good for the object of our quest.    I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes stopped  the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he stepped  out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every  subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was  not followed. Our route was certainly a singular one. Holmes's knowledge  of the byways of London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he  passed rapidly, and with an assured step, through a network of mews and  stables the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at  last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into  Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly  down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted  yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. We entered  together and he closed it behind us.    The place was pitch-dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty  house. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my  outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in  ribbons. Holmes's cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me  forwards down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the  door. Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right, and we found ourselves  in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but  faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. There  was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust, so that we could  only just discern each other's figures within. My companion put his hand  upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.    \"Do you know where we are?\" he whispered.    \"Surely that is Baker Street,\" I answered, staring through the dim  window.    \"Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old  quarters.\"    \"But why are we here?\"    \"Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might  I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window,  taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our  old rooms--the starting-point of so many of our little adventures? We  will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power  to surprise you.\"    I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes  fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down  and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a man who  was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the  luminous screen of the window. There was no mistaking the poise of the  head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features.  The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of  those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a  perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out my  hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. He was  quivering with silent laughter.    \"Well?\" said he.    \"Good heavens!\" I cried. \"It is marvellous.\"    \"I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite  variety,'\" said he, and I recognised in his voice the joy and pride  which the artist takes in his own creation. \"It really is rather like  me, is it not?\"    \"I should be prepared to swear that it was you.\"    \"The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of  Grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust in  wax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this  afternoon.\"    \"But why?\"    \"Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for  wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really  elsewhere.\"    \"And you thought the rooms were watched?\"    \"I KNEW that they were watched.\"    \"By whom?\"    \"By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader lies  in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew, and only  they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they believed that I  should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this  morning they saw me arrive.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because I recognised their sentinel when I glanced out of my window. He  is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a garroter by trade, and a  remarkable performer upon the Jew's harp. I cared nothing for him. But  I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind  him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over  the cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is  the man who is after me to-night, Watson, and that is the man who is  quite unaware that we are after HIM.\"    My friend's plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this  convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers  tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait and we were the  hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the  hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. Holmes was  silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and  that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was  a bleak and boisterous night, and the wind whistled shrilly down the  long street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in  their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen  the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared  to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house  some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion's attention  to them, but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued  to stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and  tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me  that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out  altogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and  the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in  uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him when  I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as  great a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes's arm and pointed upwards.    \"The shadow has moved!\" I cried.    It was, indeed, no longer the profile, but the back,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#3)"],[1,"g. The mother put up her white flag--which is  the snowy underside of her useful tail, and shows like a beacon by day  or night--and bounded away with a hoarse _Ka-a-a-a-h!_ of warning. One  of the little ones followed her on the instant, jumping squarely in his  mother's tracks, his own little white flag flying to guide any that  might come after him. But the second fawn ran off at a tangent, and  stopped in a moment to stare and whistle and stamp his tiny foot in an  odd mixture of curiosity and defiance. The mother had to circle back  twice before he followed her, at last, unwillingly. As she stole back  each time, her tail was down and wiggling nervously--which is the sure  sign, when you see it, that some scent of you is floating off through  the woods and telling its warning into the deer's keen nostrils. But  when she jumped away the white flag was straight up, flashing in the  very face of her foolish fawn, telling him as plain as any language what  sign he must follow if he would escape danger and avoid breaking his  legs in the tangled underbrush.    I did not understand till long afterwards, when I had watched the fawns  many times, how important is this latter suggestion. One who follows a  frightened deer and sees or hears him go bounding off at breakneck pace  over loose rocks and broken trees and tangled underbrush; rising swift  on one side of a windfall without knowing what lies on the other side  till he is already falling; driving like an arrow over ground where you  must follow like a snail, lest you wrench a foot or break an  ankle,--finds himself asking with unanswered wonder how any deer can  live half a season in the wilderness without breaking all his legs. And  when you run upon a deer at night and hear him go smashing off in the  darkness at the same reckless speed, over a tangled blow-down, perhaps,  through which you can barely force your way by daylight, then you  realize suddenly that the most wonderful part of a deer's education  shows itself, not in keen eyes or trumpet ears, or in his finely trained  nose, more sensitive a hundred times than any barometer, but in his  forgotten feet, which seem to have eyes and nerves and brains packed  into their hard shells instead of the senseless matter you see there.    Watch the doe yonder as she bounds away, wigwagging her heedless little  one to follow. She is thinking only of him; and now you see her feet  free to take care of themselves. As she rises over the big windfall,  they hang from the ankle joints, limp as a glove out of which the hand  has been drawn, yet seeming to wait and watch. One hoof touches a twig;  like lightning it spreads and drops, after running for the smallest  fraction of a second along the obstacle to know whether to relax or  stiffen, or rise or fall to meet it. Just before she strikes the ground  on the down plunge, see the wonderful hind hoofs sweep themselves  forward, surveying the ground by touch, and bracing themselves, in a  fraction of time so small that the eye cannot follow, for the shock of  what lies beneath them, whether rock or rotten wood or yielding moss.  The fore feet have followed the quick eyes above, and shoot straight and  sure to their landing; but the hind hoofs must find the spot for  themselves as they come down and, almost ere they find it, brace  themselves again for the push of the mighty muscles above.    Once only I found where a fawn with untrained feet had broken its leg;  and once I heard of a wounded buck, driven to death by dogs, that had  fallen in the same way never to rise again. Those were rare cases. The  marvel is that it does not happen to every deer that fear drives through  the wilderness.    And that is another reason why the fawns must learn to obey a wiser head  than their own. Till their little feet are educated, the mother must  choose the way for them; and a wise fawn will jump squarely in her  tracks. That explains also why deer, even after they are full grown,  will often walk in single file, a half-dozen of them sometimes following  a wise leader, stepping in his tracks and leaving but a single trail. It  is partly, perhaps, to fool their old enemy, the wolf, and their new  enemy, the man, by hiding the weakling's trail in the stride and hoof  mark of a big buck; but it shows also the old habit, and the training  which begins when the fawns first learn to follow the flag.    After that second discovery I used to go in the afternoon to a point on  the lake nearest the fawns' hiding place, and wait in my canoe for the  mother to come out and show me where she had left her little ones. As  they grew, and the drain upon her increased from their feeding, she  seemed always half starved. Waiting in my canoe I would hear the crackle  of brush, as she trotted straight down to the lake almost heedlessly,  and see her plunge through the fringe of bushes that bordered the water.  With scarcely a look or a sniff to be sure the coast was clear, she  would jump for the lily pads. Sometimes the canoe was in plain sight;  but she gave no heed as she tore up the juicy buds and stems, and  swallowed them with the appetite of a famished wolf. Then I would paddle  away and, taking my direction from her trail as she came, hunt  diligently for the fawns until I found them.    This last happened only two or three times. The little ones were already  wild; they had forgotten all about our first meeting, and when I showed  myself, or cracked a twig too near them, they would promptly bolt into  the brush. One always ran straight away, his white flag flying to show  that he remembered his lesson; the other went off zigzag, stopping at  every angle of his run to look back and question me with his eyes and  ears.    There was only one way in which such disobedience could end. I saw it  plainly enough one afternoon, when, had I been one of the fierce  prowlers of the wilderness, the little fellow's history would have  stopped short under the paw of Upweekis, the shadowy lynx of the burned  lands. It was late afternoon when I came over a ridge, following a deer  path on my way to the lake, and looked down into a long narrow valley  filled with berry bushes, and with a few fire-blasted trees standing  here and there to point out the perfect loneliness and desolation of the  place.    Just below me a deer was feeding hungrily, only her hind quarters  showing out of the underbrush. I watched her awhile, then dropped on all  fours and began to creep towards her, to see how near I could get and  what new trait I might discover. But at the first motion (I had stood at  first like an old stump on the ridge) a fawn that had evidently been  watching me all the time from his hiding sprang into sight with a sharp  whistle of warning. The doe threw up her head, looking straight at me as  if she had understood more from the signal than I had thought possible.  There was not an instant's hesitation or searching. Her eyes went direct  to me, as if the fawn's cry had said: \"Behind you, mother, in the path  by the second gray rock!\" Then she jumped away, shooting up the opposite  hill over roots and rocks as if thrown by steel springs, blowing  hoarsely at every jump, and followed in splendid style by her watchful  little one.    At the first snort of danger there was a rush in the underbrush near  where she had stood, and a second fawn sprang into sight. I knew him  instantly--the heedless one--and knew also that he had neglected too  long the matter of following the flag. He was confused, frightened,  chuckle-headed now; he came darting up the deer path in the wrong  direction, straight towards me, to within two jumps, before he noticed  the man kneeling in the path before him and watching him quietly.    At the startling discovery he stopped short, seeming to shrink smaller  and smaller before my eyes. Then he edged sidewise to a great stump, hid  himself among the roots, and stood stock-still,--a beautiful picture of  innocence and curiosity, framed in the rough brown roots of the spruce  stump. It was his first teaching, to hide and be still. Just as he  needed it most, he had forgotten absolutely the second lesson.    We watched each other full five minutes without moving an eyelash. Then  his first lesson ebbed away. He sidled out into the path again, came  towards me two dainty, halting steps, and stamped prettily with his left  fore foot. He was a young buck, and had that trick of stamping without  any instruction. It is an old, old ruse to make you move, to startle you  by the sound and threatening motion into showing who you are and what  are your intentions.    But still the man did not move; the fawn grew frightened at his own  boldness and ran away down the path. Far up the opposite hill I heard  the mother calling him. But he heeded not; he wanted to find out things  for himself. There he was in the path again, watching me. I took out my  handkerchief and waved it gently; at which great marvel he trotted back,  stopping anon to look and stamp his little foot, to show me that he was  not afraid.    \"Brave little chap, I like you,\" I thought, my heart going out to him as  he stood there with his soft eyes and beautiful face, stamping his  little foot. \"But what,\" my thoughts went on, \"had happened to you ere  now, had a bear or lucivee lifted his head over the ridge? Next month,  alas! the law will be off; then there will be hunters in these woods,  some of whom leave their hearts, with their wives and children, behind  them. You can't trust them, believe me, little chap. Your mother is  right; you can't trust them.\"    The night was coming swiftly. The mother's call, growing ever more  anxious, more insistent, swept over the darkening hillside. \"Perhaps,\" I  thought, with sudden twinges and alarms of conscience, \"perhaps I set  you all wrong, little chap, in giving you the taste of salt that day,  and teaching you to trust things that meet you in the wilderness.\" That  is generally the"]]]
