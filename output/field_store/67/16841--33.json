He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I  wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of  years ago--worse luck!\"    Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had \"cora\" on it,  and there was the picture--Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and  a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture  was written, \"Manticora.\"    In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing  its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and  when Lionel gave it a push and said, \"Go along and fight the Dragon,  do,\" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and  hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it  went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed  more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little  timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for  calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the  milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it  ate the cans as well.    And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth,  which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset,  the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged  off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting  kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took  refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying  to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the  Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard  all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had  seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad  silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the  Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting  fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments  of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However  popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do  something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty.    [Illustration \"The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office.\"  _See page 13._]    The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except  during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he  would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very  hot to begin with.    At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal  nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King  cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to  stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the  Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: \"Nurse, wipe my  face, please. I am not going to cry any more.\"    Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King.  \"Crying,\" said she, \"never did anyone any good yet.\"    \"I don't know,\" said the little King, \"I seem to see better, and to hear  better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm  right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I _must_ try to see if I  can't save the people.\"    \"Well, if you must, you must,\" said Nurse, \"but don't tear your clothes  or get your feet wet.\"    So off he went.    The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more  brightly, as Lionel once more carried _The Book of Beasts_ out into the  rose garden, and opened it--very quickly, so that he might not be afraid  and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and  there was written at the bottom of the page, \"Hippogriff,\" and before  Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of  great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly  neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a  long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great  wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and  he stood there among the roses.    The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the  little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: \"But for the wings  you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse.\" And the Blue Bird's  song was very loud and sweet.    Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling,  sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he  must do. He caught up _The Book of Beasts_ and jumped on the back of the  gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the  sharp, white ear: \"Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the  Pebbly Waste.\"    And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with  his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's  wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise.    When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff  and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they  saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began  to think what they would wear for Court mourning.    But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger  than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the  white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon  pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste.    Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there  is no sand--all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass  there and no tree within a hundred miles of it.    Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the  Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped _The Book of Beasts_ and laid  it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste  to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came  the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for  a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining  like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a  hundred miles.    The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed  on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even  had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in  another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with  his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach  them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he  should get any hotter.    It was then that he saw _The Book of Beasts_ lying on the pebbles, open  at the page with \"Dragon\" written at the bottom. He looked and he  hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage,  the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the  palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in.    As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and  sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he  jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang.    \"Oh, hurrah!\" he cried. \"Now we really have done it.\"    And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.    \"Oh, my precious Hippogriff,\" he cried. \"You are the bravest, dearest,  most beautiful--\"    \"Hush,\" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. \"Don't you see that we are  not alone?\"    And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the  Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the  Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone  who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the  Dragon to take them into the book with him--it was a tight fit even for  one Dragon--so, of course, he had to leave them outside.           *       *       *       *       *    They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after.    When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged  to be allowed to go back into the book. \"I do not care for public life,\"  he said.    Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of  his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or  anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:  That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except  in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because  there was no room for them in the book--and the milk cans too.    Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the  Hippogriff's page of the book. \"I should like,\" he said, \"to live  somewhere where Dragons can't get at me.\"    So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and  there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his  great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with.    As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own  Rocking Horse--a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden  one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the  lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day.    [Illustration: UNCLE JAMES OR THE PURPLE STRANGER]          II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger      The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.    \"What will you do when you grow up, Princess?\" asked the gardener's boy.    \"I should like to marry you, Tom,\" said the Princess. \"Would you mind?\"    \"No,\" said the gardener's boy. \"I shouldn't mind much.

Grooves should be cut on one side of all the posts to take the end  panels.    The front and lower back rails are plain except for the tenons at each  end, but the end rails and the center uprights should have grooves cut  for the panels the same as the posts. The top back rail serves as a top  back board and should have the corners rounded as shown in the detail  drawing.    The frame can now be assembled. Glue should be used on all the joints as  it makes them much stiffer. Be careful to get the frame together  perfectly square, or it will be hard to fit the doors and the shelves.    The top and bottom boards should have the corners cut to clear the  posts. The closet is divided into two compartments by a partition. This  can be made of plain boards or panels similar to those in the ends, as  desired. Place the shelves in position as shown. They are held in place  by means of cleats and screws. The one shelf has a partition in its  center with a door on one side and two small drawers on the other.  Drawers should be fitted to three of the other compartments. They are  made in the usual manner except that the front boards should be cut out  at the top for a handhold as shown.    The doors are fitted by a tenon and mortise joint at the ends. They  have a centerpiece and panels to match the ends of the closet. Suitable  hinges and a catch should be supplied. These can be purchased at any  hardware store.    [Illustration: Detail of the Wardrobe]    The backing is put on in the usual manner. It should be finished on the  front side.    When complete, the closet should be carefully gone over with fine  sandpaper and all glue and rough spots removed. Apply stain of the  desired color. This may be any of the many mission stains supplied by  the trade for this purpose.          A FINISH      An appropriate finish is obtained as follows: First thoroughly scrape  and sandpaper the various parts, then apply a coat of brown Flemish  water stain. Allow this to dry well, then sand it lightly with No. 00  sandpaper to lay the grain. Again apply the Flemish stain, but this time  have it weakened by the addition of an equal amount of water. When dry,  sand again as on the first coat. Upon the second coat of stain apply a  thin coat of shellac. This is to protect the high lights from the stain  in the filler which is to follow. Sand lightly, then apply a paste  filler of a sufficiently dark shade to make a dark field for the brown  Flemish. Clean off the surplus and polish in the usual manner.    Upon the filler, after it has hardened overnight, apply a coat of orange  shellac. Successively apply several coats of some good rubbing varnish.  Polish the first coats with haircloth or curled hair, and the last with  pulverized pumice stone, mixed with raw linseed or crude oil.          AN OAK TABLE      The accompanying illustration shows another style of a mission table.  The stock for this table if ordered as follows and sanded will require  only the work of making the joints and putting them together:      4 posts, 2 in, square 30-5/8 in., S-4-S.    4 upper rails, 7/8 by 6-1/2 by 22-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 lower rails, 7/8 by 3 by 22-1/2 in., S-2-S.    2 top pieces, 7/8 by 12-1/2 by 24-1/2 in., S-2-S.    6 slats, 3/8 by 3-1/2 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 7/8 by 8-1/2 by 21-1/2 in., S-2-S.    This table may be made with mortise and tenon joints or with dowels as  desired. If dowels are used, the upper and lower rails should be made 2  in. shorter than shown in the drawing.    Be sure to get the pieces for the posts with their surfaces square to  each other and their ends sawed square off. This will simplify the  assembling a great deal. Make the posts exactly the same length, 30-1/2  in., and chamfer a 3/8-in, bevel on their tops.    Square up the four upper rails, 6 by 22 in., marking the working face  and edge to work from when laying out the tenons later. Square up the  two lower rails, 2-1/2 by 22 in. These must be exactly the same length  as the upper rails. The two ends of the table having the slats should be  glued up first. Lay out the tenons on the upper and lower rails for  these two ends and be sure to work from the marked face and edges, using  a knife line. Cut the tenons, and, by placing them against the posts in  the exact position they are to occupy, mark the places for the mortises.  These joints should be numbered so that each mortise may be cut to fit  its own tenon.    [Illustration: Detail of Construction Finished Table]    Square up the slats, 3 by 15-1/8 in., and cut mortises in the upper and  lower rails 1/4 in. deep to let them in. The number of these slats,  their size and spacing may be arranged to suit one's own idea. Put the  posts, upper and lower rails, and slats together without glue first to  determine if the parts fit properly, and then glue and clamp them  together. Hot glue will hold best, if the room and lumber are warm; if  not, it is best to use ordinary liquid glue. While the glue on these two  ends of the table is setting, the other upper rails, top, and stretcher  may be finished.    The top will have to be made of two or three pieces joined together with  dowels and glue. If possible, use only two boards and be sure the grain  in both pieces runs the same way when they are put together.    After the ends which were glued have set at least 24 hours, the clamps  may be taken off and the other two upper rails tenoned and mortised in  place. The stretcher may be held with two 3/8-in. dowels in each end, or  with two round-head screws put through the lower rails. When gluing up  the whole table, be sure the sides are square to each other. The top may  now be squared up 24 by 24 in. and the corners cut out for the top of  the posts. The top may be fastened as shown at A and B in the drawing,  or by cleats screwed to the inside of the upper rails and top.    Before staining, be sure that all surplus glue is scraped off and the  surfaces sanded clean. A weathered or fumed oak stain is suitable for  this table. A good weathered oak stain may be made by mixing a little  drop black ground in oil with turpentine and a little linseed oil. Put  this stain on with a brush and allow to stand until it begins to  flatten or dull, then rub off across the grain with a rag or piece of  cotton waste. When thoroughly dry, apply one coat of very thin shellac.  After this has dried, finish with two coats of wax. The shellac prevents  the turpentine in the wax from rubbing out the stain. To get a good wax  finish the work should dry until it will not show finger marks, before  rubbing.          BOOK TROUGH      [Illustration: Detail of Book Trough]    A very cheap but attractive book trough is shown in the accompanying  photograph. This piece of mission furniture will be found useful in the  home or office and can be made by anyone who has a slight knowledge of  tools. The material should be either oak or chestnut, which can be  secured from the planing mill dressed and sandpapered ready to cut the  tenons and mortises. The stock needed will be as follows:      2 ends, 7/8 in. by 10 in. by 31 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 7/8 in. by 10 in. by 35 in., S-1-S.    2 trough pieces, 7/8 in. by 4 in. by 35 in., S-2-S.    8 keys, 5/8 in. by 5/8 in. by 3 in.    [Illustration: Book Trough Complete]    The two end pieces should be made first with the top corners rounded off  and the lower end, which is of simple design, can be cut out with a  bracket saw and smoothed with a wood rasp. The mortises should then be  laid out according to the sketch and cut, by first boring 3/4-in. holes  and finishing with a chisel, being careful to keep all edges clean and  free from slivers.    The shelf can now be made by cutting a double-key tenon at each end to  fit the end pieces. The space between the two tenons at each end can be  cut out with a bracket saw and finished with a rasp. The key holes  should be mortised as shown in the sketch. The trough pieces are made in  a similar manner, care being taken to have all tenons and mortises  perfectly square and a good fit, so the trough when assembled will have  a neat and workmanlike appearance. The trough can be finished in any one  of the many mission finishes which are supplied by the trade for this  purpose.          AN OAK SERVING TABLE      The serving table is another useful piece of furniture that can be made  in mission style. This table should be made in quarter-sawed oak and  stained very light. The stock order is as follows:      2 posts, 2 by 2 by 37 in., S-4-S.    2 posts, 2 by 2 by 31 in., S-4-S.    1 top, 1 by 21 by 40 in., S-2-S.    2 side rails, 3/4 by 3 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 end rails, 3/4 by 3 by 15-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 back panel, 3/4 by 4 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 1 by 5 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 slat, 1/2 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., S-4-S.    [Illustration: Serving Table Complete]    The four posts are ordered 1 in. longer than necessary for squaring to  length and the two back posts should be chamfered 1/4 in. on top, as  they are the longest and project above the back panel. All of the posts  are cut tapering for a space of 4 in. from the bottom ends. Mortises in  the posts and tenons on the rails are laid out and cut as shown by the  dimensions in the drawing. These parts are then well glued and put  together. The top, which should be of well seasoned wood, is cut to fit  around the back posts so the back edge and the back side of the posts  are flush. The back panel is placed in mortises cut in the corners of  the back posts. This is done so the back surface of the panel will be  flush the same as the edge of the top. The slat is fastened with  round-headed brass screws on the front of the two back posts about half  way between the top and the ends of the posts.    [Illustration: Detail of Serving Table]    The top may be fastened to the rails by one of two methods. One way is  to use a small button made"]]]
