To these historic  families John Jay added another, taking for his wife Sarah Livingston,  the sister of Brockholst, who later adorned the Supreme Court of the  United States, and the daughter of William, New Jersey's coming war  governor, already famous as a writer of poems and essays.    Jay's public career had begun two years before in connection with the  revolutionary Committee of Fifty-one. He did not accept office because  he loved it. He went into politics as he might have travelled on a  stage-coach at the invitation of a few congenial friends, for their  sake, not for his own. When he took up the work of organisation,  therefore, it was with no wish to become a leader; he simply desired  to guide the spirit of resistance along orderly and forceful lines.  But soon he held the reins and had his foot on the brake. In drafting  a reply to resolutions from a Boston town meeting, he suggested a  Congress of all the Colonies, to which should be referred the  disturbing question of non-importation. This letter was not only the  first serious suggestion of a general Congress, placing its author  intellectually at the head of the Revolutionary leaders; but the  plan--which meant broader organisation, more carefully concerted  measures, an enlistment of all the conservative elements, and one  official head for thirteen distinct and widely separated  colonies--gradually found favour, and resulted in sending the young  writer as a delegate to the first Continental Congress.    It was in this Congress that Jay won the right to become a  constitution-maker. Of all the men of that busy and brilliant age, no  one advanced more steadily in the general knowledge and favour. When  he wrote the address to the people of Canada, his great ability was  recognised at once; and after he composed the appeal to Ireland and to  Jamaica, the famous circular letter to the Colonies, and the patriotic  address to the people of his own State, his wisdom was more frequently  drawn upon and more widely appreciated than ever; but he may be said  to have leaped into national fame when he drafted the address to the  people of Great Britain. While still ignorant of its authorship,  Jefferson declared it \"a production of the finest pen in America.\"          CHAPTER II    MAKING A STATE CONSTITUTION    1777      It was early spring in 1777 before John Jay, withdrawing to the  country, began the work of drafting a constitution. His retirement  recalls Cowper's sigh for        \"... a lodge in some vast wilderness,      Some boundless contiguity of shade,      Where rumours of oppression and deceit,      Of unsuccessful and successful war,      Might never reach me more.\"    Too much and too little credit has been given Jay for his part in the  work. One writer says he \"entered an almost unexplored field.\" On the  other hand, John Adams wrote Jefferson that Jay's \"model and  foundation\" was his own letter to George Wythe of Virginia. Neither is  true. The field was not unexplored, nor did John Adams' letter contain  a suggestion of anything not already in existence, except the election  of a Council of Appointment, with whose consent the governor should  appoint all officers. His plan of letting the people elect a governor  came later. \"We have a government to form, you know,\" wrote Jay, \"and  God knows what it will resemble. Our politicians, like some guests at  a feast, are perplexed and undetermined which dish to prefer;\"[5] but  Jay evidently preferred the old home dishes, and it is interesting to  note how easily he adapted the laws and customs of the provincial  government to the needs of an independent State.    [Footnote 5: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.  68.]    The legislative branch of the government was vested in two separate  and distinct bodies, called the Assembly and the Senate. The first  consisted of seventy members to be elected each year; the second of  twenty-four members, one-fourth to be elected every four years.  Members of the Assembly were proportioned to the fourteen counties  according to the number of qualified voters. For the election of  senators, the State was divided into \"four great districts,\" the  eastern being allowed three members, the southern nine, the middle six  and the western six. To each house was given the powers and privileges  of the Provincial Assembly of the Colony of New York. In creating this  Legislature, Jay introduced no new feature. The old Assembly suggested  the lower house, and the former Council or upper house of the  Province, which exercised legislative powers, made a model for the  Senate.[6] In their functions and operations the two bodies were  indistinguishable.[7]    [Footnote 6: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.  610.]    [Footnote 7: _Ibid._, Vol. 2, p. 610.]    The qualifications of those who might vote for members of the  Legislature greatly restricted suffrage. Theoretically every patriot  believed in the liberties of the people, and the first article of the  Constitution declared that \"no authority shall, on any pretence  whatever, be exercised over the people of the State, but such as shall  be derived from and granted by them.\" This high-sounding exordium  promised the rights of popular sovereignty; but in practice the makers  of the Constitution, fearing the passions of the multitude as much as  the tyranny of kings, deemed it wise to keep power in the hands of a  few. A male citizen of full age, possessing a freehold of the value of  twenty pounds, or renting a tenement of the yearly value of forty  shillings, could vote for an assemblyman, and one possessing a  freehold of the value of one hundred pounds, free from all debts,  could vote for a senator.    But even these drastic conditions did not satisfy the draftsman of the  Constitution. The legislators themselves, although thus carefully  selected, might prove inefficient, and so, lest \"laws inconsistent  with the spirit of this Constitution, or with the public good, may be  hastily or unadvisedly passed,\" a Council of Revision was created,  composed of the governor, chancellor, and the three judges of the  Supreme Court, or any two of them acting with the governor, who \"shall  revise all bills about to be passed into laws by the Legislature.\" If  the Council failed to act within ten days after having possession of  the bill, or if two-thirds of each house approved it after the Council  disapproved it, the bill became law. This Council seems to have been  suggested by the veto power possessed by the King's Privy Council.    The supreme executive power and authority of the State were vested in  a governor, who must be a freeholder and chosen by the ballots of  freeholders possessed of one hundred pounds above all debts. His term  of office was three years, and his powers similar to those of  preceding Crown governors. He was commander-in-chief of the army, and  admiral of the navy. He had power to convene the Legislature in  extraordinary session; to prorogue it not to exceed sixty days in any  one year; and to grant pardons and reprieves to persons convicted of  crimes other than treason and murder, in which cases he might suspend  sentence until the Legislature acted. In accordance with the custom of  his predecessors, he was also expected to deliver a message to the  Legislature whenever it convened. To aid him in his duties, the  Constitution provided for the election of a lieutenant-governor, who  was made the presiding officer of the Senate.    The proposition that no authority should be exercised over the people  except such as came from the people necessarily opened the door to an  election of the governor by the people; but how to restrict his power  seems to have taxed Jay's ingenuity. He had reduced the number of  voters to its lowest terms, and put a curb on the Legislature, as well  as the governor, by the creation of the Council of Revision; but how  to curtail the chief executive's power in making appointments,  presented a problem which gave Jay himself, when governor, good reason  to regret the manner of its solution.    The only governors with whom Jay had had any experience were British  governors, and the story of their rule was a story of astonishing  mistakes and vexing stupidities. To go no farther back than Lord  Cornbury, the dissolute cousin of Queen Anne, not one in the long  list, covering nearly a century, exhibited gifts fitting him for the  government of a spirited and intelligent people, or made the slightest  impression for good either for the Crown or the Colony. Their  disposition was to be despotic, and to prevent a repetition of such  arbitrary conduct, Jay sought to restrict the governor's power in  making appointments to civil office.    The new Constitution provided for the appointment of sheriffs, mayors  of cities, district attorneys, coroners, county treasurers, and all  other officers in the State save governor, lieutenant-governor, state  treasurer and town officers. Some members of the convention wished the  governor to make these appointments; others wanted his power limited  by the Legislature's right to confirm. Jay saw objections to both  methods. The first would give the governor too much power; the latter  would transfer too much to the Legislature. To reconcile these  differences, therefore, he proposed \"Article XXIII. That all officers,  other than those who, by this Constitution, are directed to be  otherwise appointed, shall be appointed in the manner following, to  wit: The Assembly shall, once in every year, openly nominate and  appoint one of the senators from each great district, which senators  shall form a Council for the appointment of the said officers, of  which the governor shall be president and have a casting vote, but no  other vote; and with the advice and consent of the said Council shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#3)"],[1,"to be chosen in all places, and met at a general  Assembly,\" Smith, p. 128. Stith says, \"And about the latter end of June  he called,\" &c., Stith, p. 160. Neither intimate _when_ the Assembly  _met_, only that the governor called them to the latter part of  June.--ED.    [5] The first published notice of the existence of this paper occurred  in the proceedings of the annual meeting of the Virginia Historical  society, held December 15, 1853. In the report of the Executive  Committee the chairman, Conway Robinson, Esq., states that he had seen  the original report in the State Paper Office in London, on a recent  visit to that city.--See Virginia Historical Reporter, Vol. I., 1854.  Whatever question there may be in regard to priority of discovery, it is  to be regretted that it was left to the Historical Society of another  State to publish a document of so much value to the one to which it  solely relates.--ED.    [6] The Secretary of the Colony and Speaker of the first Assembly was  John Pory. If he had been one of the Burgesses his name would have  appeared with the others. Through the influence of the Earl at Warwick  he was made Secretary to the Virginia Company. Campbell says, \"He was  educated at Cambridge, where he took the Master of Arts in April, 1610.  It is supposed he was a member of the House of Commons. He was much of a  traveller, and was at Venice in 1613, at Amsterdam in 1617, and shortly  after at Paris.\" \"Sir George Yeardley appointed him one of his  Council.\"--Campbell, p. 139. The record shows that he acted as the  presiding officer of the first Assembly, whether _ex officio_ or by  selection is not stated. It will be seen that a typographical error in  Bancroft's pamphlet makes his name Povy. In Smith's General Historie  there is a paper styled \"The observations of Master John Pory,  Secretarie of Virginia, in his travels;\" it gives an account of his  voyage to the eastern shore.--Smith, p. 141. Neill says of him, \"John  Pory was a graduate of Cambridge, a great traveller and good writer, but  gained the reputation of being a chronic tipler and literary vagabond  and sponger.\" When young he excited the interest of Hakluyt, who, in a  dedication to the third volume of his, remarks: \"Now, because long since  I did foresee that my profession of Divinitie, the care of my family;  and other occasions, might call or divert me from these kind of  endeavour, I, therefore have, for these three years last past,  encouraged and gathered in these studies of Cosmographia and former  histories my honest, industrious and learned friend, Mr. John Porey, one  of speciall skill and extraordinary hope, to perform great matters in  the same, and beneficial to the Commonwealth.\" \"Pory, in 1600, prepared  a _Geographical History of Africa_, but he soon disappointed the  expectations of his friends.\"    A letter from London, dated July 26, 1623, says: \"Our old acquaintance,  Mr. Porey, is in poore case, and in prison at the Terceras, whither he  was driven by contrary winds, from the north coast of Virginia, where he  had been upon some discovery, and upon his arrival he was arraigned and  in danger of being hanged for a pirate.\" \"He died about 1635.\" For  further particulars from contemporary authorities, see Neill's History  of the Virginia Company of London.

The most convenient place we could finde to sitt in was the Quire of the  Churche Where Sir George Yeardley, the Governour, being sett downe in  his accustomed place, those of the Counsel of Estate sate nexte him on  both handes, excepte onely the Secretary then appointed Speaker, who  sate right before him, John Twine, clerke[12] of the General assembly,  being placed nexte the Speaker, and Thomas Pierse, the Sergeant,  standing at the barre, to be ready for any service the Assembly shoulde  comaund[13] him. But forasmuche as men's affaires doe little prosper  where God's service is neglected, all the Burgesses tooke their places  in the Quire till a prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the Minister, that it  would please God to guide and sanctifie all our proceedings[14] to his  owne glory and the good of this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the  intente that as we[15] had begun at God Almighty, so we[16] might  proceed w^{th} awful and due respecte towards the Lieutenant, our most  gratious and dread Soveraigne, all the Burgesses were intreatted to  retyre themselves into the body of the Churche, w^{ch} being done,  before they were fully admitted, they were called in order and by name,  and so every man (none staggering at it) tooke the oathe of Supremacy,  and then entred[17] the Assembly. At Captaine Warde the Speaker tooke  exception, as at one that without any Comission or authority had seatted  himselfe either upon the Companies, and then his Plantation would not be  lawfull, or on Captain Martin's lande, and so[18] he was but a limbe or  member of him, and there could be but two Burgesses for all. So Captaine  Warde was comanded to absente himselfe till such time as the Assembly  had agreed what was fitt for him to doe. After muche debate, they  resolved on this order following:    [7] Boyes, McDonald.  [8] Guiste, Bancroft.    [9] Gourgainy, McDonald and Bancroft.    [10] Ensign, Bancroft.    [11] Ensign, Bancroft.    [12] Clerk, McDonald.    [13] Comand, McDonald.    [14] Proceedinges, Bancroft.    [15] wee, McDonald.    [16] wee, McDonald.    [17] entered, McDonald.

At the reading of the names of the Burgesses, Exception was taken  against Captaine Warde as having planted here in Virginia without any  authority or comission from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in  Englande. But considering he had bene at so great chardge and paines to  augmente this Colony, and had adventured his owne person in the action,  and since that time had brought home a good[20] quantity of fishe, to  relieve the Colony by waye of trade, and above all, because the  Comission for authorising the General Assembly admitteth of two  Burgesses out of every plantation w^{th}out restrainte or exception.  Upon all these considerations, the Assembly was contented to admitt of  him and his Lieutenant (as members of their body and Burgesses) into  their society. Provided, that the said Captaine Warde, w^{th} all  expedition, that is to saye between this and the nexte general assembly  (all lawful impediments excepted), should procure from the Tresurer,[21]  Counsell and Company in England a comission lawfully to establish[22]  and plant himselfe and his Company as the Chieffs[23] of other  Plantations have done. And in case he doe neglect this he is to stande  to the censure of the nexte generall assembly. To this Captaine Warde,  in the presence of us all, having given his consente and undertaken to  performe the same, was, together w^{th} his Lieutenant, by voices of the  whole Assembly first admitted to take the oath of Supremacy, and then to  make up their number and to sitt amongst them.
