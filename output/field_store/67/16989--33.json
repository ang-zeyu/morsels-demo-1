[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28019"],[0,"Birds in the Bush (#3)"],[1,"nce, I  remember that the song of this bird and that of the gray-cheeked  thrush[1] were heard all along the ridge from Mount Clinton to Mount  Washington. The finest bird concert I ever attended in Boston was given  on Monument Hill by a great chorus of fox-colored sparrows, one morning  in April. A high wind had been blowing during the night, and the moment  I entered the Common I discovered that there had been an extraordinary  arrival of birds, of various species. The parade ground was full of  snow-birds, while the hill was covered with fox-sparrows,--hundreds of  them, I thought, and many of them in full song. It was a royal concert,  but the audience, I am sorry to say, was small. It is unfortunate, in  some aspects of the case, that birds have never learned that a _matinee_  ought to begin at two o'clock in the afternoon.    These sparrows please me by their lordly treatment of their European  cousins. One in particular, who was holding his ground against three of  the Britishers, moved me almost to the point of giving him three cheers.    Of late a few crow blackbirds have taken to building their nests in one  corner of our domain; and they attract at least their full share of  attention, as they strut about the lawns in their glossy clerical suits.  One of the gardeners tells me that they sometimes kill the sparrows. I  hope they do. The crow blackbird's attempts at song are ludicrous in the  extreme, as every note is cracked, and is accompanied by a ridiculous  caudal gesture. But he is ranked among the oscines, and seems to know  it; and, after all, it is only the common fault of singers not to be  able to detect their own want of tunefulness.    I was once crossing the Common, in the middle of the day, when I was  suddenly arrested by the call of a cuckoo. At the same instant two men  passed me, and I heard one say to the other, \"Hear that cuckoo! Do you  know what it means? No? Well, _I_ know what it means: it means that it's  going to rain.\" It did rain, although not for a number of days, I  believe. But probably the cuckoo has adopted the modern method of  predicting the weather some time in advance. Not very long afterwards I  again heard this same note on the Common; but it was several years  before I was able to put the cuckoo into my Boston list, as a bird  actually seen. Indeed it is not so very easy to see him anywhere; for he  makes a practice of robbing the nests of smaller birds, and is always  skulking about from one tree to another, as though he were afraid of  being discovered, as no doubt he is. What Wordsworth wrote of the  European species (allowance being made for a proper degree of poetic  license) is equally applicable to ours:--        \"No bird, but an invisible thing,        A voice, a mystery.\"    When I did finally get a sight of the fellow it was on this wise. As I  entered the Garden, one morning in September, a goldfinch was calling so  persistently and with such anxious emphasis from the large sophora tree  that I turned my steps that way to ascertain what could be the trouble.  I took the voice for a young bird's, but found instead a male adult, who  was twitching his tail nervously and scolding _phee-phee_, _phee-phee_,  at a black-billed cuckoo perched near at hand, in his usual sneaking  attitude. The goldfinch called and called, till my patience was nearly  spent. (Small birds know better than to attack a big one so long as the  latter is at rest.) Then, at last, the cuckoo started off, the finch  after him, and a few minutes later I saw the same flight and chase  repeated. Several other goldfinches were flying about in the  neighborhood, but only this one was in the least excited. Doubtless he  had special reasons of his own for dreading the presence of this  cowardly foe.    One of our regular visitors twice a year is the brown creeper. He is so  small and silent, and withal his color is so like that of the bark to  which he clings, that I suspect he is seldom noticed even by persons who  pass within a few feet of him. But he is not too small to be hectored by  the sparrows, and I have before now been amused at the encounter. The  sparrow catches sight of the creeper, and at once bears down upon him,  when the creeper darts to the other side of the tree, and alights again  a little further up. The sparrow is after him; but, as he comes dashing  round the trunk, he always seems to expect to find the creeper perched  upon some twig, as any other bird would be, and it is only after a  little reconnoitring that he again discovers him clinging to the  vertical bole. Then he makes another onset with a similar result; and  these manoeoeuvres are repeated, till the creeper becomes disgusted,  and takes to another tree.    The olive-backed thrushes and the hermits may be looked for every spring  and autumn, and I have known forty or fifty of the former to be present  at once. The hermits most often travel singly or in pairs, though a  small flock is not so very uncommon. Both species preserve absolute  silence while here; I have watched hundreds of them, without hearing so  much as an alarm note. They are far from being pugnacious, but their  sense of personal dignity is large, and once in a while, when the  sparrows pester them beyond endurance, they assume the offensive with  much spirit. There are none of our feathered guests whom I am gladder to  see; the sight of them inevitably fills me with remembrances of happy  vacation seasons among the hills of New Hampshire. If only they would  sing on the Common as they do in those northern woods! The whole city  would come out to hear them.    During every migration large numbers of warblers visit us. I have noted  the golden-crowned thrush, the small-billed water-thrush, the  black-and-white creeper, the Maryland yellow-throat, the blue  yellow-back, the black-throated green, the black-throated blue, the  yellow-rump, the summer yellow-bird, the black-poll, the Canada  flycatcher, and the redstart. No doubt the list is far from complete,  as, of course, I have not used either glass or gun; and without one or  other of these aids the observer must be content to let many of these  small, tree-top-haunting birds pass unidentified. The two kinglets give  us a call occasionally, and in the late summer and early autumn the  humming-birds spend several weeks about our flower-beds.    It would be hard for the latter to find a more agreeable stopping-place  in the whole course of their southward journey. What could they ask  better than beds of tuberoses, Japanese lilies, _Nicotiana_ (against the  use of which they manifest not the slightest scruple), petunias, and the  like? Having in mind the Duke of Argyll's assertion that \"no bird can  ever fly backwards,\"[2] I have more than once watched these  humming-birds at their work on purpose to see whether they would respect  the noble Scotchman's dictum. I am compelled to report that they  appeared never to have heard of his theory. At any rate they very  plainly did fly tail foremost; and that not only in _dropping_ from a  blossom,--in which case the seeming flight might have been, as the duke  maintains, an optical illusion merely,--but even while backing out of  the flower-tube in an upward direction. They are commendably catholic in  their tastes. I saw one exploring the disk of a sunflower, in company  with a splendid monarch butterfly. Possibly he knew that the sunflower  was just then in fashion. Only a few minutes earlier the same bird--or  another like him--had chased an English sparrow out of the Garden,  across Arlington Street, and up to the very roof of a House, to the  great delight of at least one patriotic Yankee. At another time I saw  one of these tiny beauties making his morning toilet in a very pretty  fashion, leaning forward, and brushing first one cheek and then the  other against the wet rose leaf on which he was perched.    The only swallows on my list are the barn swallows and the  white-breasted. The former, as they go hawking about the crowded  streets, must often send the thoughts of rich city merchants back to the  big barns of their grandfathers, far off in out-of-the-way country  places. Of course we have the chimney swifts, also (near relatives of  the humming-birds!), but they are not swallows.    Speaking of the swallows, I am reminded of a hawk that came to Boston,  one morning, fully determined not to go away without a taste of the  famous imported sparrows. It is nothing unusual for hawks to be seen  flying over the city, but I had never before known one actually to make  the Public Garden his hunting-ground. This bird perched for a while on  the Arlington Street fence, within a few feet of a passing carriage;  next he was on the ground, peering into a bed of rhododendrons; then for  a long time he sat still in a tree, while numbers of men walked back  and forth underneath; between whiles he sailed about, on the watch for  his prey. On one of these last occasions a little company of swallows  came along, and one of them immediately went out of his way to swoop  down upon the hawk, and deal him a dab. Then, as he rejoined his  companions, I heard him give a little chuckle, as though he said, \"There!  did you see me peck at him? You don't think I am afraid of such a  fellow as that, do you?\" To speak in Thoreau's manner, I rejoiced in the  incident as a fresh illustration of the ascendency of spirit over  matter.    One is always glad to find a familiar bird playing a new _role_, and  especially in such a spot as the Common, where, at the best, one can  hope to see so very little. It may be assumed, therefore, that I felt  peculiarly grateful to a white-bellied nuthatch, when I discovered him  bopping about on the ground--on Monument Hill; a piece of humility such  as I had never before detected any nuthatch in the practice of. Indeed,  this fellow looked so unlike himself, moving briskly through the grass  with long, awkward leaps, that at first "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#3)"],[1," toy in the Turkish harem, or a  drudge in the German fields, to a leader of thought in the literary  circles of France, England, and America!    In an age when the wrongs of society are adjusted in the courts and at  the ballot-box, material force yields to reason and majorities.    Woman's steady march onward, and her growing desire for a broader  outlook, prove that she has not reached her normal condition, and that  society has not yet conceded all that is necessary for its attainment.    Moreover, woman's discontent increases in exact proportion to her  development. Instead of a feeling of gratitude for rights accorded,  the wisest are indignant at the assumption of any legal disability  based on sex, and their feelings in this matter are a surer test of  what her nature demands, than the feelings and prejudices of the sex  claiming to be superior. American men may quiet their consciences with  the delusion that no such injustice exists in this country as in  Eastern nations, though with the general improvement in our  institutions, woman's condition must inevitably have improved also,  yet the same principle that degrades her in Turkey, insults her in  this republic. Custom forbids a woman there to enter a mosque, or call  the hour for prayers; here it forbids her a voice in Church Councils  or State Legislatures. The same taint of her primitive state of  slavery affects both latitudes.    The condition of married women, under the laws of all countries, has  been essentially that of slaves, until modified, in some respects,  within the last quarter of a century in the United States. The change  from the old Common Law of England, in regard to the civil rights of  women, from 1848 to the advance legislation in most of the Northern  States in 1880, marks an era both in the status of woman as a citizen  and in our American system of jurisprudence. When the State of New  York gave married women certain rights of property, the individual  existence of the wife was recognized, and the old idea that \"husband  and wife are one, and that one the husband,\" received its death-blow.  From that hour the statutes of the several States have been steadily  diverging from the old English codes. Most of the Western States  copied the advance legislation of New York, and some are now even more  liberal.    The broader demand for political rights has not commanded the thought  its merits and dignity should have secured. While complaining of many  wrongs and oppressions, women themselves did not see that the  political disability of sex was the cause of all their special  grievances, and that to secure equality anywhere, it must be  recognized everywhere. Like all disfranchised classes, they begun by  asking to have certain wrongs redressed, and not by asserting their  own right to make laws for themselves.    Overburdened with cares in the isolated home, women had not the time,  education, opportunity, and pecuniary independence to put their  thoughts clearly and concisely into propositions, nor the courage to  compare their opinions with one another, nor to publish them, to any  great extent, to the world.    It requires philosophy and heroism to rise above the opinion of the  wise men of all nations and races, that to be unknown, is the highest  testimonial woman can have to her virtue, delicacy and refinement.    A certain odium has ever rested on those who have risen above the  conventional level and sought new spheres for thought and action, and  especially on the few who demand complete equality in political  rights. The leaders in this movement have been women of superior  mental and physical organization, of good social standing and  education, remarkable alike for their domestic virtues, knowledge of  public affairs, and rare executive ability; good speakers and writers,  inspiring and conducting the genuine reforms of the day; everywhere  exerting themselves to promote the best interests of society; yet they  have been uniformly ridiculed, misrepresented, and denounced in public  and private by all classes of society.    Woman's political equality with man is the legitimate outgrowth of the  fundamental principles of our Government, clearly set forth in the  Declaration of Independence in 1776, in the United States Constitution  adopted in 1784, in the prolonged debates on the origin of human  rights in the anti-slavery conflict in 1840, and in the more recent  discussions of the party in power since 1865, on the 13th, 14th, and  15th Amendments to the National Constitution; and the majority of our  leading statesmen have taken the ground that suffrage is a natural  right that may be regulated, but can not be abolished by State law.    Under the influence of these liberal principles of republicanism that  pervades all classes of American minds, however vaguely, if suddenly  called out, they might be stated, woman readily perceives the  anomalous position she occupies in a republic, where the government  and religion alike are based on individual conscience and  judgment--where the natural rights of all citizens have been  exhaustively discussed, and repeatedly declared equal.    From the inauguration of the government, representative women have  expostulated against the inconsistencies between our principles and  practices as a nation. Beginning with special grievances, woman's  protests soon took a larger scope. Having petitioned State  legislatures to change the statutes that robbed her of children,  wages, and property, she demanded that the Constitutions--State and  National--be so amended as to give her a voice in the laws, a choice  in the rulers, and protection in the exercise of her rights as a  citizen of the United States.    While the laws affecting woman's civil rights have been greatly  improved during the past thirty years, the political demand has made  but a questionable progress, though it must be counted as the chief  influence in modifying the laws. The selfishness of man was readily  enlisted in securing woman's civil rights, while the same element in  his character antagonized her demand for political equality.    Fathers who had estates to bequeath to their daughters could see the  advantage of securing to woman certain property rights that might  limit the legal power of profligate husbands.    Husbands in extensive business operations could see the advantage of  allowing the wife the right to hold separate property, settled on her  in time of prosperity, that might not be seized for his debts. Hence  in the several States able men championed these early measures. But  political rights, involving in their last results equality everywhere,  roused all the antagonism of a dominant power, against the  self-assertion of a class hitherto subservient. Men saw that with  political equality for woman, they could no longer keep her in social  subordination, and \"the majority of the male sex,\" says John Stuart  Mill, \"can not yet tolerate the idea of living with an equal.\" The  fear of a social revolution thus complicated the discussion. The  Church, too, took alarm, knowing that with the freedom and education  acquired in becoming a component part of the Government, woman would  not only outgrow the power of the priesthood, and religious  superstitions, but would also invade the pulpit, interpret the Bible  anew from her own stand-point, and claim an equal voice in all  ecclesiastical councils. With fierce warnings and denunciations from  the pulpit, and false interpretations of Scripture, women have been  intimidated and misled, and their religious feelings have been played  upon for their more complete subjugation. While the general principles  of the Bible are in favor of the most enlarged freedom and equality of  the race, isolated texts have been used to block the wheels of  progress in all periods; thus bigots have defended capital punishment,  intemperance, slavery, polygamy, and the subjection of woman. The  creeds of all nations make obedience to man the corner-stone of her  religious character. Fortunately, however, more liberal minds are now  giving us higher and purer expositions of the Scriptures.    As the social and religious objections appeared against the demand for  political rights, the discussion became many-sided, contradictory, and  as varied as the idiosyncrasies of individual character. Some said,  \"Man is woman's natural protector, and she can safely trust him to  make laws for her.\" She might with fairness reply, as he uniformly  robbed her of all property rights to 1848, he can not safely be  trusted with her personal rights in 1880, though the fact that he did  make some restitution at last, might modify her distrust in the  future. However, the calendars of our courts still show that fathers  deal unjustly with daughters, husbands with wives, brothers with  sisters, and sons with their own mothers. Though woman needs the  protection of one man against his whole sex, in pioneer life, in  threading her way through a lonely forest, on the highway, or in the  streets of the metropolis on a dark night, she sometimes needs, too,  the protection of all men against this one. But even if she could be  sure, as she is not, of the ever-present, all-protecting power of one  strong arm, that would be weak indeed compared with the subtle,  all-pervading influence of just and equal laws for all women. Hence  woman's need of the ballot, that she may hold in her own right hand  the weapon of self-protection and self-defense.    Again it is said: \"The women who make the demand are few in number,  and their feelings and opinions are abnormal, and therefore of no  weight in considering the aggregate judgment on the question.\" The  number is larger than appears on the surface, for the fear of public  ridicule, and the loss of private favors from those who shelter, feed,  and clothe them, withhold many from declaring their opinions and  demanding their rights.
