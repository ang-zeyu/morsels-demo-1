The various forms of pests such as the chinch bug, potato  beetles, and others do an enormous amount of damage each year. They  destroy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crops annually in the  United States alone. They devour enough to pay for the entire cost of  running the school system of our country and nearly enough to meet all  the expenses of our government. In view of these facts it is the duty of  each and every farmer, young or old, to acquaint himself with these  destructive pests and prepare himself for combating them. With a  knowledge of the methods of controlling these pests much of this  enormous loss can be prevented.    While some insects are extremely injurious, others are very helpful. The  products of the honey bee in the United States alone amount to several  million dollars a year, to say nothing of its value to the farmer in  pollinating fruits. The annual output of silk, all of which is spun by  the silkworm, is worth millions of dollars. Many other forms are of  value to man by producing material of commercial value such as lac,  shellack, dyes, medicines, etc. Of all the beneficial insects those  which are of greatest value to man are the parasites and similar forms  which help to keep in check many of the severest pests of the farm.  Insects are not all bad fellows by any means. One must acquaint himself  with those which are good and those which are bad before he can hope to  deal with them intelligently.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_And with childlike credulous affection        We behold those tender wings expand,      Emblems of our own great resurrection,        Emblems of the bright and better land._\"                                            --LONGFELLOW.          CHAPTER II    COLLECTING INSECTS        \"_Does he who searches Nature's secrets scruple      To stick a pin into an insect?_\"                                            --A. G. OEHLENSCHLAEGER.      In the life of every normal human there comes a time when he wishes to  make a collection of some kind. It may be a collection of coins, postage  stamps, post-cards, shells, relics, birds' eggs, pressed flowers or  insects. If the child grows up in the country, the result of this  craving is usually three or four cigar boxes of insects or an almanac or  geography stuffed with the most attractive wild flowers of the field. A  collection of this sort may be small and poorly kept and yet it is worth  while. In later life one will search in his mother's closet or attic  for the old cigar boxes which contain the remains of youthful efforts,  usually a mass of gaudy wings, fragments of insect legs and bodies and a  few rusty pins. This desire to make a collection is natural and should  be encouraged in the child. It tends to make him observe closely and  creates an interest in things about him, and if properly directed it  will add a store of information which can be gotten in no other way.      _Directions for Collecting_    Many boys and girls of the rural schools will have little time or  inclination to provide themselves with apparatus for collecting insects.  An old straw hat or a limb will serve their purpose. From their point of  view what difference does it make if they tear off most of the legs and  break the wings? They succeed in securing the \"bug\" and when pinned in  the box it will mean just about as much to them as the most perfect  specimen ever prepared.    [Illustration: A convenient home-made net for catching insects; note the  broom-stick handle, heavy twisted wire and mosquito net bag.]    This method of catching insects will prove effective where nothing  better is available, but any child can easily make a small insect net by  attaching a loop of fairly stiff wire to a broom handle or other stick  and sewing a bag of mosquito netting or other thin cloth to the wire. By  means of such a net one can catch insects more easily and at the same  time there is less danger of tearing such insects as butterflies. Care  must be taken in handling the stinging insects.    [Illustration: A cyanide jar for killing insects; note the lumps of the  deadly poison potassium cyanide in the bottom covered and sealed by a  layer of plaster of Paris.]    The country boy and girl will have little trouble getting hold of  insects, but they are often puzzled when it comes to killing them. It  seems cruel to pin up an insect alive and have it squirm for a day or  two and some means of killing them should be devised. Most of the soft  insects, such as flies, butterflies, etc., can be killed by pressing  their body, in the region of the wings, between one's thumb and  forefinger. Such forms as beetles and wasps can be quickly killed by  dropping them into coal oil or a strong soap suds. Any method which can  be devised for quickly killing the insect, and which will not seriously  mutilate it, can be used.    A convenient killing bottle can be made by sealing a few small lumps of  the deadly poison, potassium or sodium cyanide, in the bottom of a  strong, wide-mouthed bottle, with plaster of Paris; or a few drops of  chloroform or ether on a wad of cotton in a similar bottle, will also  serve as a convenient killing jar.      _Pinning and Preserving a Collection_    [Illustration: Method of pinning different kinds of insects.]    After the insects, have been caught and killed, they should then be  prepared for the permanent collection. Most insects such as wasps,  beetles, flies and grasshoppers should simply have a pin thrust through  their bodies until they are two-thirds the way up on the pin and then  put them away in a box. Such forms as butterflies and moths make a much  better collection if the wings are spread so as to bring out their gaudy  markings. In order to spread butterflies' wings, one needs a spreading  board, which can be made in ten minutes by taking a pine board two feet  long, and six inches wide and on this nail two strips an inch thick, so  that there is a crack between them. The crack should be half an inch  wide at one end and a quarter of an inch wide at the other end, and in  the bottom of it press strips of cornstalk pith so as to have something  soft in which to stick the pins. After a pin has been stuck through the  body of a dead butterfly between the wings, it is then pinned in the  crack so that the back of the butterfly is on a level with the strips.  Then the wings are drawn forward until they stand straight out from the  body when they are pinned down by means of strips of paper and left to  dry a few days until they become perfectly rigid. In this way a most  beautiful collection can be made very easily, but where time and  materials are not available, simply pin them up like other insects,  leaving the wings to hang as they will. After the specimens are pinned  they should be put away in cigar boxes in the bottom of which is pinned  or pasted a layer of cork or corrugated paper similar to that which  comes between glass fruit cans. These make ideal cases for keeping small  collections as the odor of tobacco helps keep pests from getting in to  destroy the collection.    [Illustration: Home-made spreading board for spreading butterflies and  moths.]    [Illustration: Cigar box with strip of corrugated paper in bottom used  as case for keeping pinned insects.]      _Rearing and Observing Them While Alive_    While studying an insect it is advisable wherever possible to first  study it where it is found in the field and later bring it home and keep  it alive in a jar where it can be fed and observed and its various  habits studied. Cages for breeding insects consist simply of a few glass  fruit cans and jelly glasses with tin or cloth covers. A child can  borrow one or two of these from his mother's fruit cellar. A layer of  moist sand or soil should be put in the bottom of the jar to provide a  retreat for those forms which go into the ground before changing to  adults. Before an insect is placed in one of these breeding cages its  food plant should be determined by observations in the field, and every  day or two a fresh supply should be gathered. Most of the forms  discussed in the following chapters can be kept in jars and reared to  the adult stage. Rearing insects is both interesting and instructive.  Every child should be given an opportunity to rear a few forms either  during the school year or during the summer vacation.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_I happened one night in my travels        To stray into Butterfly Vale,      Where my wondering eyes beheld butterflies        WITH WINGS THAT WERE WIDE AS A SAIL.      They lived in such houses of grandeur,        Their days were successions of joys,      And the very last fad these butterflies had        WAS MAKING COLLECTIONS OF BOYS._        \"_There were boys of all sizes and ages        PINNED UP ON THEIR WALLS.

Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in  his hand again.  First he dropped me, then he quarrelled with Sarah,  and now that Mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are  going with them.\"    It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she  felt very deeply.  Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy  at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative.  She told us  many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering  off on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she  gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and  those of their hospitals.  Holmes listened attentively to everything,  throwing in a question from time to time.    \"About your second sister, Sarah,\" said he.  \"I wonder, since you are  both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.\"    \"Ah! you don't know Sarah's temper or you would wonder no more. I tried  it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago,  when we had to part.  I don't want to say a word against my own sister,  but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.\"    \"You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.\"    \"Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time.  Why, she went up  there to live in order to be near them.  And now she has no word hard  enough for Jim Browner.  The last six months that she was here she  would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways.  He had caught  her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was  the start of it.\"    \"Thank you, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing.  \"Your  sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?  Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a  case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.\"    There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.    \"How far to Wallington?\" he asked.    \"Only about a mile, sir.\"    \"Very good.  Jump in, Watson.  We must strike while the iron is hot.  Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive  details in connection with it.  Just pull up at a telegraph office as  you pass, cabby.\"    Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in  the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his  face. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which  we had just quitted.  My companion ordered him to wait, and had his  hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman  in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.    \"Is Miss Cushing at home?\" asked Holmes.    \"Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,\" said he.  \"She has been  suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her  medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing  anyone to see her.  I should recommend you to call again in ten days.\"  He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street.    \"Well, if we can't we can't,\" said Holmes, cheerfully.    \"Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\"    \"I did not wish her to tell me anything.  I only wanted to look at her.  However, I think that I have got all that I want.  Drive us to some  decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we  shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.\"    We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk  about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had  purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred  guineas, at a Jew broker's in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five  shillings.  This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a  bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that  extraordinary man.  The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare  had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the  police-station.  Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.    \"A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.    \"Ha!  It is the answer!\"  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,  and crumpled it into his pocket.  \"That's all right,\" said he.    \"Have you found out anything?\"    \"I have found out everything!\"    \"What!\" Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  \"You are joking.\"    \"I was never more serious in my life.  A shocking crime has been  committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\"    \"And the criminal?\"    Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards  and threw it over to Lestrade.    \"That is the name,\" he said.  \"You cannot effect an arrest until  to-morrow night at the earliest.  I should prefer that you do not  mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be  only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in  their solution.  Come on, Watson.\"  We strode off together to the  station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the  card which Holmes had thrown him.      \"The case,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that  night in our rooms at Baker Street, \"is one where, as in the  investigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'A Study in  Scarlet' and of 'The Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to reason  backward from effects to causes.  I have written to Lestrade asking him  to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will  only get after he had secured his man.  That he may be safely trusted  to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as  tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and  indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at  Scotland Yard.\"    \"Your case is not complete, then?\" I asked.    \"It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of the  revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us.  Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.\"    \"I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is  the man whom you suspect?\"    \"Oh! it is more than a suspicion.\"    \"And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\"    \"On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me run  over the principal steps.  We approached the case, you remember, with  an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage.  We had formed  no theories.  We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences  from our observations.  What did we see first?  A very placid and  respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a  portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters.  It  instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for  one of these.  I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or  confirmed at our leisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember,  and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.    \"The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard  ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our  investigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which is popular  with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the  male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among  sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all the actors in the  tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes.    \"When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it  was to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be  Miss Cushing, and although her initial was 'S' it might belong to one  of the others as well.  In that case we should have to commence our  investigation from a fresh basis altogether.  I therefore went into the  house with the intention of clearing up this point.  I was about to  assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made  when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was  that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the  same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.    \"As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the  body which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is as a rule  quite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In last year's  Anthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen  upon the subject.  I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with  the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical  peculiarities.  Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss  Cushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female  ear which I had just inspected.  The matter was entirely beyond  coincidence.  There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same  broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner  cartilage.  In all essentials it was the same ear.    \"In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had  until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the  mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard  of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had  at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone  up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards  divided them.  This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for  some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to  Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.    \"And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully.  We  had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of  strong passions--you remember that he threw up what must have been a  very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife--subject, too, to  occasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his  wife"]]]
