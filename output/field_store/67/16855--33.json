[Note: Written in 1823 at Kishineff and Odessa.]        CANTO THE FIRST    'The Spleen'    'He rushes at life and exhausts the passions.'                                  Prince Viazemski      Canto the First    I    \"My uncle's goodness is extreme,  If seriously he hath disease;  He hath acquired the world's esteem  And nothing more important sees;  A paragon of virtue he!  But what a nuisance it will be,  Chained to his bedside night and day  Without a chance to slip away.  Ye need dissimulation base  A dying man with art to soothe,  Beneath his head the pillow smooth,  And physic bring with mournful face,  To sigh and meditate alone:  When will the devil take his own!\"    II    Thus mused a madcap young, who drove  Through clouds of dust at postal pace,  By the decree of Mighty Jove,  Inheritor of all his race.  Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,(1)  Let me present ye to the man,  Who without more prevarication  The hero is of my narration!  Oneguine, O my gentle readers,  Was born beside the Neva, where  It may be ye were born, or there  Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.  I also wandered there of old,  But cannot stand the northern cold.(2)    [Note 1: _Ruslan and Liudmila_, the title of Pushkin's first  important work, written 1817-20. It is a tale relating the adventures  of the knight-errant Ruslan in search of his fair lady Liudmila, who  has been carried off by a _kaldoon_, or magician.]    [Note 2: Written in Bessarabia.]    III    Having performed his service truly,  Deep into debt his father ran;  Three balls a year he gave ye duly,  At last became a ruined man.  But Eugene was by fate preserved,  For first \"madame\" his wants observed,  And then \"monsieur\" supplied her place;(3)  The boy was wild but full of grace.  \"Monsieur l'Abbe,\" a starving Gaul,  Fearing his pupil to annoy,  Instructed jestingly the boy,  Morality taught scarce at all;  Gently for pranks he would reprove  And in the Summer Garden rove.    [Note 3: In Russia foreign tutors and governesses are commonly  styled \"monsieur\" or \"madame.\"]    IV    When youth's rebellious hour drew near  And my Eugene the path must trace--  The path of hope and tender fear--  Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.  Lo! my Oneguine free as air,  Cropped in the latest style his hair,  Dressed like a London dandy he  The giddy world at last shall see.  He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,  In the French language perfectly,  Danced the mazurka gracefully,  Without the least constraint he bowed.  What more's required? The world replies,  He is a charming youth and wise.    V    We all of us of education  A something somehow have obtained,  Thus, praised be God! a reputation  With us is easily attained.  Oneguine was--so many deemed  [Unerring critics self-esteemed],  Pedantic although scholar like,  In truth he had the happy trick  Without constraint in conversation  Of touching lightly every theme.  Silent, oracular ye'd see him  Amid a serious disputation,  Then suddenly discharge a joke  The ladies' laughter to provoke.    VI    Latin is just now not in vogue,  But if the truth I must relate,  Oneguine knew enough, the rogue  A mild quotation to translate,  A little Juvenal to spout,  With \"vale\" finish off a note;  Two verses he could recollect  Of the Aeneid, but incorrect.  In history he took no pleasure,  The dusty chronicles of earth  For him were but of little worth,  Yet still of anecdotes a treasure  Within his memory there lay,  From Romulus unto our day.    VII    For empty sound the rascal swore he  Existence would not make a curse,  Knew not an iamb from a choree,  Although we read him heaps of verse.  Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,  But Adam Smith to read appeared,  And at economy was great;  That is, he could elucidate  How empires store of wealth unfold,  How flourish, why and wherefore less  If the raw product they possess  The medium is required of gold.  The father scarcely understands  His son and mortgages his lands.    VIII    But upon all that Eugene knew  I have no leisure here to dwell,  But say he was a genius who  In one thing really did excel.  It occupied him from a boy,  A labour, torment, yet a joy,  It whiled his idle hours away  And wholly occupied his day--  The amatory science warm,  Which Ovid once immortalized,  For which the poet agonized  Laid down his life of sun and storm  On the steppes of Moldavia lone,  Far from his Italy--his own.(4)    [Note 4: Referring to Tomi, the reputed place of exile of Ovid.  Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament  as his predecessor in song, though he certainly did not plead  guilty to the fact, since he remarks in his ode to Ovid:                         To exile _self-consigned_,     With self, society, existence, discontent,     I visit in these days, with melancholy mind,     The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.    Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:       \"Perdiderint quum me _duo_ crimina, carmen et error,     Alterius facti culpa silenda mihi est.\"                       _Ovidii Nasonis Tristium_, lib. ii. 207.]      IX    How soon he learnt deception's art,  Hope to conceal and jealousy,  False confidence or doubt to impart,  Sombre or glad in turn to be,  Haughty appear, subservient,  Obsequious or indifferent!  What languor would his silence show,  How full of fire his speech would glow!  How artless was the note which spoke  Of love again, and yet again;  How deftly could he transport feign!  How bright and tender was his look,  Modest yet daring! And a tear  Would at the proper time appear.    X    How well he played the greenhorn's part  To cheat the inexperienced fair,  Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,  Sometimes by ready-made despair;  The feeble moment would espy  Of tender years the modesty  Conquer by passion and address,  Await the long-delayed caress.  Avowal then 'twas time to pray,  Attentive to the heart's first beating,  Follow up love--a secret meeting  Arrange without the least delay--  Then, then--well, in some solitude  Lessons to give he understood!    XI    How soon he learnt to titillate  The heart of the inveterate flirt!  Desirous to annihilate  His own antagonists expert,  How bitterly he would malign,  With many a snare their pathway line!  But ye, O happy husbands, ye  With him were friends eternally:  The crafty spouse caressed him, who  By Faublas in his youth was schooled,(5)  And the suspicious veteran old,  The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,  Who floats contentedly through life,  Proud of his dinners and his wife!    [Note 5: _Les Aventures du Chevalier de Faublas_, a romance of a  loose character by Jean Baptiste Louvet de Couvray, b. 1760,  d. 1797, famous for his bold oration denouncing Robespierre,  Marat and Danton.]    XII    One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,  His valet brings him letters three.  What, invitations? The same day  As many entertainments be!  A ball here, there a children's treat,  Whither shall my rapscallion flit?  Whither shall he go first? He'll see,  Perchance he will to all the three.  Meantime in matutinal dress  And hat surnamed a \"Bolivar\"(6)  He hies unto the \"Boulevard,\"  To loiter there in idleness  Until the sleepless Breguet chime(7)  Announcing to him dinner-time.    [Note 6: A la \"Bolivar,\" from the founder of Bolivian independence.]    [Note 7: M. Breguet, a celebrated Parisian watchmaker--hence a  slang term for a watch.]    XIII    'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,  \"Drive on!\" the cheerful cry goes forth,  His furs are powdered on the way  By the fine silver of the north.  He bends his course to Talon's, where(8)  He knows Kaverine will repair.(9)  He enters. High the cork arose  And Comet champagne foaming flows.  Before him red roast beef is seen  And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,  Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,  The choicest flowers of French cuisine,  And Limburg cheese alive and old  Is seen next pine-apples of gold.    [Note 8: Talon, a famous St. Petersburg restaurateur.]    [Note 9: Paul Petrovitch Kaverine, a friend for whom Pushkin in  his youth appears to have entertained great respect and  admiration. He was an officer in the Hussars of the Guard, and  a noted \"dandy\" and man about town. The poet on one occasion  addressed the following impromptu to his friend's portrait:       \"Within him daily see the the fires of punch and war,     Upon the fields of Mars a gallant warrior,     A faithful friend to friends, of ladies torturer,                         But ever the Hussar.\"]    XIV    Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels  To cool the cutlets' seething grease,  When the sonorous Breguet tells  Of the commencement of the piece.  A critic of the stage malicious,  A slave of actresses capricious,  Oneguine was a citizen  Of the domains of the side-scene.  To the theatre he repairs  Where each young critic ready stands,  Capers applauds with clap of hands,  With hisses Cleopatra scares,  Moina recalls for this alone  That all may hear his voice's tone.    XV    Thou fairy-land! Where formerly  Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,  Von Wisine, friend of liberty,  And Kniajnine, apt at copying.  The young Simeonova too there  With Ozeroff was wont to share  Applause, the people's donative.  There our Katenine did revive  Corneille's majestic genius,  Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out  His comedies, a noisy rout,  There Didelot became glorious,  There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade  The drama of my youth was played.(10)    [Note 10: _Denis Von Wisine_ (1741-92), a favourite Russian  dramatist. His first comedy \"The Brigadier,\" procured him the  favour of the second Catherine. His best, however, is the  \"Minor\" (Niedorosl). Prince Potemkin, after witnessing it,  summoned the author, and greeted him with the exclamation,  \"D"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2400"],[0,"Vikram and the Vampire: Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance (#3)"],[1,"law, and music, the riding of horses and  elephants--especially the latter--the driving of chariots, and the use  of the broadsword, the bow, and the mogdars or Indian clubs. They were  ordered to be skilful in all kinds of games, in leaping and running, in  besieging forts, in forming and breaking bodies of troops; they were  to endeavour to excel in every princely quality, to be cunning in  ascertaining the power of an enemy, how to make war, to perform  journeys, to sit in the presence of the nobles, to separate the  different sides of a question, to form alliances, to distinguish between  the innocent and the guilty, to assign proper punishments to the wicked,  to exercise authority with perfect justice, and to be liberal. The boys  were then sent to school, and were placed under the care of excellent  teachers, where they became truly famous. Whilst under pupilage, the  eldest was allowed all the power necessary to obtain a knowledge of  royal affairs, and he was not invested with the regal office till in  these preparatory steps he had given full satisfaction to his subjects,  who expressed high approval of his conduct.    The two brothers often conversed on the duties of kings, when the  great Vikramaditya gave the great Bhartari-hari the following valuable  advice[17]:    \"As Indra, during the four rainy months, fills the earth with water, so  a king should replenish his treasury with money. As Surya the sun,  in warming the earth eight months, does not scorch it, so a king, in  drawing revenues from his people, ought not to oppress them. As Vayu,  the wind, surrounds and fills everything, so the king by his officers  and spies should become acquainted with the affairs and circumstances  of his whole people. As Yama judges men without partiality or prejudice,  and punishes the guilty, so should a king chastise, without favour,  all offenders. As Varuna, the regent of water, binds with his pasha or  divine noose his enemies, so let a king bind every malefactor safely in  prison. As Chandra,[18] the moon, by his cheering light gives pleasure  to all, thus should a king, by gifts and generosity, make his people  happy. And as Prithwi, the earth, sustains all alike, so should a king  feel an equal affection and forbearance towards every one.\"    Become a monarch, Vikram meditated deeply upon what is said of  monarchs:--\"A king is fire and air; he is both sun and moon; he is the  god of criminal justice; he is the genius of wealth; he is the regent  of water; he is the lord of the firmament; he is a powerful divinity who  appears in human shape.\" He reflected with some satisfaction that the  scriptures had made him absolute, had left the lives and properties  of all his subjects to his arbitrary will, had pronounced him to be  an incarnate deity, and had threatened to punish with death even ideas  derogatory to his honour.    He punctually observed all the ordinances laid down by the author of the  Niti, or institutes of government. His night and day were divided into  sixteen pahars or portions, each one hour and a half, and they were  disposed of as follows:--    Before dawn Vikram was awakened by a servant appointed to this  special duty. He swallowed--a thing allowed only to a khshatriya or  warrior--Mithridatic every morning on the saliva[19], and he made the  cooks taste every dish before he ate of it. As soon as he had risen,  the pages in waiting repeated his splendid qualities, and as he left his  sleeping-room in full dress, several Brahmans rehearsed the praises  of the gods. Presently he bathed, worshipped his guardian deity, again  heard hymns, drank a little water, and saw alms distributed to the poor.  He ended this watch by auditing his accounts.    Next entering his court, he placed himself amidst the assembly. He was  always armed when he received strangers, and he caused even women to be  searched for concealed weapons. He was surrounded by so many spies and  so artful, that of a thousand, no two ever told the same tale. At  the levee, on his right sat his relations, the Brahmans, and men of  distinguished birth. The other castes were on the left, and close to  him stood the ministers and those whom he delighted to consult. Afar  in front gathered the bards chanting the praises of the gods and of  the king; also the charioteers, elephanteers, horsemen, and soldiers of  valour. Amongst the learned men in those assemblies there were ever  some who were well instructed in all the scriptures, and others who had  studied in one particular school of philosophy, and were acquainted only  with the works on divine wisdom, or with those on justice, civil and  criminal, on the arts, mineralogy or the practice of physic;  also persons cunning in all kinds of customs; riding-masters,  dancing-masters, teachers of good behaviour, examiners, tasters, mimics,  mountebanks, and others, who all attended the court and awaited the  king's commands. He here pronounced judgment in suits of appeal. His  poets wrote about him:                   The lord of lone splendour an instant suspends                 His course at mid-noon, ere he westward descends;                 And brief are the moments our young monarch knows,                 Devoted to pleasure or paid to repose!    Before the second sandhya,[20] or noon, about the beginning of the third  watch, he recited the names of the gods, bathed, and broke his fast in  his private room; then rising from food, he was amused by singers and  dancing girls. The labours of the day now became lighter. After eating  he retired, repeating the name of his guardian deity, visited the  temples, saluted the gods conversed with the priests, and proceeded  to receive and to distribute presents. Fifthly, he discussed political  questions with his ministers and councillors.    On the announcement of the herald that it was the sixth watch--about  2 or 3 P.M.--Vikram allowed himself to follow his own inclinations, to  regulate his family, and to transact business of a private and personal  nature.    After gaining strength by rest, he proceeded to review his troops,  examining the men, saluting the officers, and holding military councils.  At sunset he bathed a third time and performed the five sacraments of  listening to a prelection of the Veda; making oblations to the manes;  sacrificing to Fire in honour of the deities; giving rice to dumb  creatures; and receiving guests with due ceremonies. He spent the  evening amidst a select company of wise, learned, and pious men,  conversing on different subjects, and reviewing the business of the day.    The night was distributed with equal care. During the first portion  Vikram received the reports which his spies and envoys, dressed in every  disguise, brought to him about his enemies. Against the latter he  ceased not to use the five arts, namely--dividing the kingdom, bribes,  mischief-making, negotiations, and brute-force--especially preferring  the first two and the last. His forethought and prudence taught him  to regard all his nearest neighbours and their allies as hostile. The  powers beyond those natural enemies he considered friendly because they  were the foes of his foes. And all the remoter nations he looked upon as  neutrals, in a transitional or provisional state as it were, till they  became either his neighbours' neighbours, or his own neighbours, that is  to say, his friends or his foes.    This important duty finished he supped, and at the end of the third  watch he retired to sleep, which was not allowed to last beyond three  hours. In the sixth watch he arose and purified himself. The seventh  was devoted to holding private consultations with his ministers, and to  furnishing the officers of government with requisite instructions. The  eighth or last watch was spent with the Purohita or priest, and with  Brahmans, hailing the dawn with its appropriate rites; he then bathed,  made the customary offerings, and prayed in some unfrequented place near  pure water.    And throughout these occupations he bore in mind the duty of kings,  namely--to pursue every object till it be accomplished; to succour all  dependents, and hospitably to receive guests, however numerous. He was  generous to his subjects respecting taxes, and kind of speech; yet he  was inexorable as death in the punishment of offenses. He rarely hunted,  and he visited his pleasure gardens only on stated days. He acted in his  own dominions with justice; he chastised foreign foes with rigour; he  behaved generously to Brahmans, and he avoided favouritism amongst his  friends. In war he never slew a suppliant, a spectator, a person asleep  or undressed, or anyone that showed fear. Whatever country he conquered,  offerings were presented to its gods, and effects and money were given  to the reverends. But what benefited him most was his attention to the  creature comforts of the nine Gems of Science: those eminent men ate  and drank themselves into fits of enthusiasm, and ended by immortalizing  their patron's name.    Become Vikram the Great he established his court at a delightful and  beautiful location rich in the best of water. The country was difficult  of access, and artificially made incapable of supporting a host of  invaders, but four great roads met near the city. The capital was  surrounded with durable ramparts, having gates of defence, and near it  was a mountain fortress, under the especial charge of a great captain.    The metropolis was well garrisoned and provisioned, and it surrounded  the royal palace, a noble building without as well as within. Grandeur  seemed embodied there, and Prosperity had made it her own. The nearer  ground, viewed from the terraces and pleasure pavilions, was a lovely  mingling of rock and mountain, plain and valley, field and fallow,  crystal lake and glittering stream. The banks of the winding Lavana  were fringed with meads whose herbage, pearly with morning dew, afforded  choicest grazing "]]]
