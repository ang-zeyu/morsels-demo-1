My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my  spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;  and weary journeys lie before me!\"    It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his  hands in his breeches' pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he  did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.    \"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed, in a  business-like manner, though with humility and deference.    \"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.    \"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And traveling all the time?\"    \"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no peace. Incessant torture  of remorse.\"    \"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.    \"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.    \"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\"  said Scrooge.    The Ghost, on hearing this set up another cry, and clanked its chain  hideously.    \"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the Phantom, \"not to know  that ages of incessant labor, by immortal creatures, for this earth must  pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all  developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its  little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short  for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret  can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such was I!  Oh! such was I!\"    \"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge,  who now began to apply this to himself.    \"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \"Mankind was my  business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,  forbearance, and benevolence, were, all my business. The dealings of my  trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my  business!\"    It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all  its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.    \"At this time of the rolling year,\" the Spectre said, \"I suffer most.  Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,  and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a  poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have  conducted _me_?\"    Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the Spectre going on at this  rate, and began to quake exceedingly.    \"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly gone.\"    \"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,  Jacob! Pray!\"    \"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may  not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"    It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the  perspiration from his brow.    \"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued the Ghost. \"I am here  to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my  fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"    \"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge. \"Thank'ee!\"    \"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\"    Scrooge's countenance fell.    \"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned. Jacob?\" he demanded, in a  faltering voice.    \"It is.\"    \"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.    \"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the  path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.\"    \"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted  Scrooge.    \"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon  the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.  Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember  what has passed between us!\"    The apparition walked backward from him toward the window, and floated  out upon the bleak, dark night.    Scrooge followed to the window; desperate in his curiosity. He looked  out.    The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in  restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains  like Marley's ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were  linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to  Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost,  in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle,  who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an  infant, whom it saw below upon a door-step. The misery with them all  was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters  and had lost the power for ever.    Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he  could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the  night became as it had been when he walked home.    Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had  entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,  and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped at  the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the  fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull  conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of  repose, went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon  the instant.      STAVE TWO.    THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS.      When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could  scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his  chamber. He was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes,  when the chimes of a neighboring church clock struck twelve.    \"Why it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a  whole day and far into another night!\"    Scrooge lay and thought and thought it over and over, and could make  nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was, and the  more he endeavored not to think, the more he thought. Marley's ghost  bothered him exceedingly. \"Was it a dream or not?\"    Scrooge lay in this state until he remembered, on a sudden, that the  Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled One. He  resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and considering that he  could not go to sleep, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his  power.    He was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze  unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his  listening ear.    \"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"nothing else!\"    He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,  dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the  instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.    The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the  curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which  his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and  Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face  to face with the visitor who drew them.    It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like  an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the  appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a  child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its  back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in  it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and  muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.  Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper  members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist  was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a  branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction  of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But  the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there  sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and  which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a  great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.    \"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked  Scrooge.    \"I am!\"    The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of being so  close beside him, it were at a distance.    \"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.    \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"    \"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge; observant of its dwarfish stature.    \"No. Your past.\"    Scrooge then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.    \"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.    Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that  a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The  Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:    \"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"    It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the  arm.    \"Rise! and walk with me!\"    It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the  hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm and the  thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in  his slippers, dressing-gown, and night-cap; and that he had a cold upon  him at the time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to  be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made toward the  window, clasped its robe in supplication.    \"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"    \"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon  his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"    As the words were spoken, they passed out, and stood upon an open  country road, with fields on either hand."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#3)"],[1,"a large balance above for weighing subjects.

The two small diagrams are cross-sections of brine and heating  coils.]    The bed calorimeter and the absorbing-system table are better shown in  fig. 4, a general view of the laboratory taken near the temperature  recorder. In the immediate foreground is the table for the absorption  system, and back of it are the observer's table and chair calorimeter.  At the right, the bed calorimeter with the front removed and the rubber  hose connections as carried from the absorber table to the bed  calorimeter are shown. At the extreme left is the balance for weighing  the absorbers. Above the chair calorimeter can be seen the balance for  weighing the subject, and at its right the galvanometer suspended from  the ceiling.    The west side of the laboratory at the moment of writing contains the  larger proportion of the apparatus. On the east side there exist only  the balance for weighing oxygen cylinders and an unfinished[4] large  calorimeter, which will be used for experiments of long duration. A view  taken near the front end of the bed calorimeter is shown in fig. 5. At  the right, the structural skeleton of the large calorimeter is clearly  shown. Some of the copper sections to be used in constructing the lining  of the calorimeter can be seen against the wall in the rear.    At the left the balance for weighing the oxygen cylinders is shown with  its counterpoise. A reserve oxygen cylinder is standing immediately in  front of it. A large calorimeter modeled somewhat after the plan of  Sonden and Tigerstedt's apparatus in Stockholm and Helsingfors is  planned to be built immediately back of the balance for weighing oxygen  cylinders.      HEATING AND VENTILATING.    Of special interest in connection with this calorimeter laboratory are  the plans for maintaining constant temperature and humidity (fig. 6).  The room is heated by five steam radiators (each with about 47 square  feet of radiating surface) placed about the outer wall, which are  controlled by two pendant thermostats. A certain amount of indirect  ventilation is provided, as indicated by the arrows on the inner wall.  The room is cooled and the humidity regulated by a system of  refrigeration installed in an adjoining room. This apparatus is of  particular interest and will be described in detail.    In the small room shown at the south side of the laboratory is placed a  powerful electric fan which draws the air from above the floor of the  calorimeter laboratory, draws it over brine coils, and sends it out into  a large duct suspended on the ceiling of the laboratory. This duct has a  number of openings, each of which can be controlled by a valve, and an  unlimited supply of cold air can be directed to any portion of the  calorimeter room at will. To provide for more continuous operation and  for more exact temperature control, a thermostat has been placed in the  duct and is so constructed as to operate some reheater coils beneath the  brine-coils in the refrigerating room. This thermostat is set at 60 deg.  F., and when the temperature of the air in the duct falls below this  point, the reheater system is automatically opened or closed. The  thermostat can be set at any point desired. Up to the present time it has  been unnecessary to utilize this special appliance, as the control by  hand regulation has been most satisfactory.    Two vertical sections through the refrigerating coils are shown in fig.  6. Section A-B shows the entrance near the floor of the calorimeter  room. The air is drawn down over the coils, passes through the blower,  and is forced back again to the top of the calorimeter room into the  large duct. If outdoor air is desired, a special duct can be connected  with the system so as to furnish outdoor air to the chamber. This has  not as yet been used. Section C-D shows the fan and gives a section  through the reheater. The brine coils, 400 meters long, are in  triplicate. If one set becomes covered with moisture and is somewhat  inefficient, this can be shut off and the other two used. When the  frozen moisture melts and drops off, the single coil can be used again.  It has been found that the system so installed is most readily  controlled.    The degree of refrigeration is varied in two ways: (1) the area of brine  coils can be increased or decreased by using one, two, or all three of  the coils; or (2) the amount of air passing over the cooling pipes may  be varied by changing the speed of the blower. In practice substantially  all of the regulation is effected by varying the position of the  controlling lever on the regulating rheostat. The apparatus functionates  perfectly and the calorimeter room can be held at 20 deg. C. day in and  day out, whether the temperature outdoors is 40 deg. below or 100 deg.  above 0 deg. F.    It can be seen, also, that this system provides a very satisfactory  regulation of the humidity, for as the air passes over the brine coils  the moisture is in large part frozen out. As yet, no hygrometric study  has been made of the air conditions over a long period, but the  apparatus is sufficiently efficient to insure thorough electrical  insulation and absence of leakage in the intricate electrical  connections on the calorimeters.    The calorimeters employ the thermo-electric element with its low  potential and a D'Arsonval galvanometer of high sensibility, and in  close proximity it is necessary to use the 110-volt current for heating,  consequently the highest degree of insulation is necessary to prevent  disturbing leakage of current.    The respiration calorimeter laboratory is so large, the number of  assistants in the room at any time is (relatively speaking) so small,  seldom exceeding ten, and the humidity and temperature are so very  thoroughly controlled, that as yet it has been entirely unnecessary to  utilize even the relatively small amount of indirect ventilation  provided in the original plans.    During the greater part of the winter it is necessary to use only one of  the thermostats and the radiators connected with the other can be shut  off, since each radiator can be independently closed by the valves on  the steam supply and return which go through the floor to the basement.  The temperature control of this room is therefore very satisfactory and  economical.    It is not necessary here to go into the advantages of temperature  control of the working rooms during the summer months. Every one seems  to be thoroughly convinced that it is necessary to heat rooms in the  winter, but our experience thus far has shown that it is no less  important to cool the laboratory and control the temperature and  moisture during the summer months, as by this means both the efficiency  and endurance of the assistants, to say nothing of the accuracy of the  scientific measurements, are very greatly increased. Arduous scientific  observations that would be wholly impossible in a room without  temperature control can be carried on in this room during the warmest  weather.

In describing this apparatus, for the sake of clearness, the  calorimetric features will be considered before the appliances for the  determination of the respiratory products.      FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE APPARATUS.    The measurements of heat eliminated by man, as made by this apparatus,  are based upon the fact that the subject is inclosed in a heat-proof  chamber through which a current of cold water is constantly passing.
