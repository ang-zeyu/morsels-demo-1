[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#3)"],[1,"he had heard from the elder Africanus in a dream. Now if  it be true that in proportion to a man's goodness the escape from what  may be called the prison and bonds of the flesh is easiest, whom can  we imagine to have had an easier voyage to the gods than Scipio? I am  disposed to think, therefore, that in his case mourning would be a sign  of envy rather than of friendship. If, however, the truth rather is that  the body and soul perish together, and that no sensation remains, then  though there is nothing good in death, at least there is nothing bad.  Remove sensation, and a man is exactly as though he had never been born;  and yet that this man was born is a joy to me, and will be a subject of  rejoicing to this State to its last hour.    Wherefore, as I said before, all is as well as possible with him. Not so  with me; for as I entered life before him, it would have been fairer  for me to leave it also before him. Yet such is the pleasure I take  in recalling our friendship, that I look upon my life as having been a  happy one because I have spent it with Scipio. With him I was associated  in public and private business; with him I lived in Rome and served  abroad; and between us there was the most complete harmony in our  tastes, our pursuits, and our sentiments, which is the true secret of  friendship. It is not therefore in that reputation for wisdom mentioned  just now by Fannius--especially as it happens to be groundless--that  I find my happiness so much, as in the hope that the memory of our  friendship will be lasting. What makes me care the more about this is  the fact that in all history there are scarcely three or four pairs of  friends on record; and it is classed with them that I cherish a hope of  the friendship of Scipio and Laelius being known to posterity.    _Fannius_. Of course that must be so, Laelius. But since you have  mentioned the word friendship, and we are at leisure, you would be doing  me a great kindness, and I expect Scaevola also, if you would do as it  is your habit to do when asked questions on other subjects, and tell  us your sentiments about friendship, its nature, and the rules to be  observed in regard to it.    _Scaevola_. I shall of course be delighted. Fannius has anticipated the  very request I was about to make. So you will be doing us both a great  favour.    5. _Laelius_. I should certainly have no objection if I felt confidence  in myself. For the theme is a noble one, and we are (as Fannius has  said) at leisure. But who am I? and what ability have I? What you  propose is all very well for professional philosophers, who are used,  particularly if Greeks, to have the subject for discussion proposed to  them on the spur of the moment. It is a task of considerable difficulty,  and requires no little practice. Therefore for a set discourse on  friendship you must go, I think, to professional lecturers. All I can  do is to urge on you to regard friendship as the greatest thing in the  world; for there is nothing which so fits in with our nature, or is so  exactly what we want in prosperity or adversity.    But I must at the very beginning lay down this principle--_friendship  can only exist between good men_. I do not, however, press this  too closely, like the philosophers who push their definitions to a  superfluous accuracy. They have truth on their side, perhaps, but it is  of no practical advantage. Those, I mean, who say that no one but the  \"wise\" is \"good.\" Granted, by all means. But the \"wisdom\" they mean is  one to which no mortal ever yet attained. We must concern ourselves  with the facts of everyday life as we find it--not imaginary and  ideal perfections. Even Gaius Fannius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius  Coruncanius, whom our ancestors decided to be \"wise,\" I could never  declare to be so according to their standard. Let them, then, keep  this word \"wisdom\" to themselves. Everybody is irritated by it; no one  understands what it means. Let them but grant that the men I mentioned  were \"good.\" No, they won't do that either. No one but the \"wise\" can be  allowed that title, say they. Well, then, let us dismiss them and manage  as best we may with our own poor mother wit, as the phrase is.    We mean then by the \"good\" _those whose actions and lives leave no  question as to their honour, purity, equity, and liberality; who are  free from greed, lust, and violence; and who have the courage of their  convictions_. The men I have just named may serve as examples. Such men  as these being generally accounted \"good,\" let us agree to call them so,  on the ground that to the best of human ability they follow nature as  the most perfect guide to a good life.    Now this truth seems clear to me, that nature has so formed us that  a certain tie unites us all, but that this tie becomes stronger from  proximity. So it is that fellow-citizens are preferred in our affections  to foreigners, relations to strangers; for in their case Nature herself  has caused a kind of friendship to exist, though it is one which lacks  some of the elements of permanence. Friendship excels relationship in  this, that whereas you may eliminate affection from relationship, you  cannot do so from friendship. Without it relationship still exists in  name, friendship does not. You may best understand this friendship by  considering that, whereas the merely natural ties uniting the human race  are indefinite, this one is so concentrated, and confined to so narrow a  sphere, that affection is ever shared by two persons only or at most by  a few.    6. Now friendship may be thus defined: a complete accord on all subjects  human and divine, joined with mutual goodwill and affection. And with  the exception of wisdom, I am inclined to think nothing better than this  has been given to man by the immortal gods. There are people who give  the palm to riches or to good health, or to power and office, many even  to sensual pleasures. This last is the ideal of brute beasts; and of the  others we may say that they are frail and uncertain, and depend less on  our own prudence than on the caprice of fortune. Then there are those  who find the \"chief good\" in virtue. Well, that is a noble doctrine. But  the very virtue they talk of is the parent and preserver of friendship,  and without it friendship cannot possibly exist.    Let us, I repeat, use the word virtue in the ordinary acceptation and  meaning of the term, and do not let us define it in high-flown language.  Let us account as good the persons usually considered so, such as  Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus. Such men as these are good  enough for everyday life; and we need not trouble ourselves about those  ideal characters which are nowhere to be met with.    Well, between men like these the advantages of friendship are almost  more than I can say. To begin with, how can life be worth living, to use  the words of Ennius, which lacks that repose which is to be found in the  mutual good-will of a friend? What can be more delightful than to  have some one to whom you can say everything with the same absolute  confidence as to yourself? Is not prosperity robbed of half its value if  you have no one to share your joy? On the other hand, misfortunes  would be hard to bear if there were not some one to feel them even more  acutely than yourself. In a word, other objects of ambition serve for  particular ends--riches for use, power for securing homage, office for  reputation, pleasure for enjoyment, health for freedom from pain and  the full use of the functions of the body. But friendship embraces  innumerable advantages. Turn which way you please, you will find it at  hand. It is everywhere; and yet never out of place, never unwelcome.  Fire and water themselves, to use a common expression, are not of more  universal use than friendship. I am not now speaking of the common  or modified form of it, though even that is a source of pleasure and  profit, but of that true and complete friendship which existed  between the select few who are known to fame. Such friendship enhances  prosperity, and relieves adversity of its burden by halving and sharing  it.    7. And great and numerous as are the blessings of friendship, this  certainly is the sovereign one, that it gives us bright hopes for the  future and forbids weakness and despair. In the face of a true friend a  man sees as it were a second self. So that where his friend is he is;  if his friend be rich, he is not poor; though he be weak, his friend's  strength is his; and in his friend's life he enjoys a second life  after his own is finished. This last is perhaps the most difficult to  conceive. But such is the effect of the respect, the loving remembrance,  and the regret of friends which follow us to the grave. While they take  the sting out of death, they add a glory to the life of the survivors.  Nay, if you eliminate from nature the tie of affection, there will be an  end of house and city, nor will so much as the cultivation of the soil  be left. If you don't see the virtue of friendship and harmony, you may  learn it by observing the effects of quarrels and feuds. Was any family  ever so well established, any State so firmly settled, as to be beyond  the reach of utter destruction from animosities and factions? This may  teach you the immense advantage of friendship.    They say that a certain philosopher of Agrigentum, in a Greek poem,  pronounced with the authority of an oracle the doctrine that whatever in  nature and the universe was unchangeable was so in virtue of the binding  force of friendship; whatever was changeable was so by the solvent power  of discord. And indeed this is a truth which everybody understands and  practically attests by experience. For if any marked instance of loyal  friendship in confronting or sharing danger comes to light, every one  applauds it to the echo. What cheers there were, for instance, all  over the theatre at a passage in the new play of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28126"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, April, 1880 (#3)"],[1,"enthusiast, or  of an ambitious sectary? What mildness! What purity in his manners! What  touching favor in his instructions! What elevation in his maxims! What  presence of mind! What ingenuity, and what justice in his answers! What  government of his passions! What prejudice, blindness or ill faith must  that be which dares to compare Socrates with the Son of Mary!    \"What a difference between the two! Socrates, dying without a pain,  without disgrace, easily sustains his part to the last. The death of  Socrates, philosophizing with his friends, is the mildest that could be  desired. That of Jesus, expiring in torments, injured, mocked, cursed by  all the people, is the most horrible that can be feared. Socrates, taking  the impoisoned cup, blesses him who presents it to him with tears. Jesus,  in the midst of a frightful punishment, prays for his enraged  executioners. Yes, if the life and death of Socrates are those of a wise  man, the life and death of Jesus are those of a God.\" If such be the  model, the pattern, the example which I am to follow, let me live and die  a Christian. I love the religion of Christ, because its character compels  its enemies to speak thus of it. I love it because of its practical  influence in elevating all into the moral image of Christ. I love it  because it saves men through its influence from abominable sins and  consequent sorrows that would tear up the hearts of thousands. I love it  because it is the power of God to save the soul. I love it because it  leads men into communion and fellowship with all the good. I love it  because it leads to heaven and to God.            Civilization, it is true, is an arbitrary term. Anthropologists have not  yet settled the boundary line between a savage and a civilized  people.--_Prof. Owen, F. R. S._            DESIGN IN NATURE.      It is scarcely necessary to designate instances in the works of nature, in  which there is an appearance of purpose, for everything has this  appearance. I will, however, mention several cases as samples.    1. The adaptation of the covering of animals to the climates in which they  live. Northern animals have thicker and warmer coats of fur or hair than  Southern ones. And here it should be remarked that man, the only creature  capable of clothing himself, is the only one that is not clothed by  nature. Singular discrimination and care indeed for non-intelligence!    2. The adaptation of animals to the elements in which they live, the fish  to the water, other animals to the air. Would not an unintelligent energy  or power be as likely to form the organs of a fish for air as for water?    3. The necessity which man has for sustenance, and the supply of that  necessity by nature.    Here let it be noted how many things must act in unison to produce the  necessary result. The earth must nourish the seed, the sun must warm it,  the rain must moisten it, and man must have the strength to cultivate it,  and the organs to eat it, and the stomach to digest it, and the  blood-vessels to circulate it, and so on. Is it credible that all these  things should _happen_ without design?    4. The pre-adaptation of the infant to the state of things into which it  enters at birth. The eye is exactly suited to the light, the ear to sound,  the nose to smell, the palate to taste, the lungs to the air. How is it  possible to see no design in this pre-adaptation, so curious, so  complicated in so many particulars?    5. The milk of animals suitable for the nourishment of their young,  provided just in season, provided without contrivance on the part of the  parent, and sought for without instruction or experience on the part of  its offspring! _and all by chance!!_    6. The different sexes. In this case, as in the rest, there is perfect  adaptation, which displays evident design. And there is more. What, I ask,  is there _in nature_ to cause a difference in sexes? Why are not all  either males or females? or, rather, a compound? This case, then, I  consider not only an evidence of design, but likewise an evidence of the  special and continued _volition_ of the Creator.    7. The destitution of horns on the calf and of teeth in the suckling. All  other parts are perfect at the very first; but were calves and sucklings  to have teeth and horns, what sore annoyances would these appendages prove  to their dams and dames. How is it that all the necessary parts of the  young are thus perfect at the first, and their annoying parts unformed  till circumstances render them no annoyance--unformed at the time they are  not needed, and produced when they are, for defense and mastication? Who  can fail to see intelligence here?    8. The teats of animals. These bear a general proportion to the number of  young which they are wont to have at a time. Those that are wont to have  few young have few teats; those that have many young have many teats. Were  these animals to make preparations themselves in this respect, how could  things be more appropriate?    9. The pea and the bean. The pea-vine, unable to stand erect of itself,  has tendrils with which to cling to a supporter; but the bean-stalk,  self-sustained, has nothing of the kind.    10. The pumpkin. This does not grow on the oak; to fall on the tender head  of the wiseacre reposing in its shade, _reasoning_ that it should grow  there rather than where it does, because, forsooth, the oak would be able  to sustain it. And were he to undertake to set the other works of  Providence to rights which he now considers wrong, 'tis a chance if he  would not get many a thump upon his pate ere he should get the universe  arranged to his mind. And if, before completing his undertaking, he should  not find it the easier of the two to arrange his mind to the universe, it  would be because _what __ little_ brains he _has_ would get thumped out of  his cranium altogether!    11. The great energies of nature. To suppose the existence of _powers_ as  the cause of the operations of nature--powers destitute of life, and, at  the same time, self-moving, and acting upon matter without the  intervention of extrinsic agency, is just as irrational as to suppose such  a power in a machine, and is a gross absurdity and a self-contradiction.  But to suppose that these lifeless energies, even if possessed of such  qualities, could, void of intelligence, produce _such_ effects as _are_  produced in the universe, requires credulity capable of believing  anything.    12. The whole universe, whether considered in its elementary or its  organized state. From the simple grass to the tender plant, and onward to  the sturdy oak; from the least insect up to man, there is skill the most  consummate, design the most clear. What substance, useless as it may be  when uncompounded with other substances, does not manifest design in its  affinity to those substances, by a union with which it is rendered useful?  What plant, what shrub, what tree has not organization and arrangement the  most perfect imaginable? What insect so minute that contains not, within  its almost invisible exterior, adjustment of part to part in the most  exact order throughout all its complicated system, infinitely transcending  the most ingenious productions of art, and the most appropriate adaptation  of all those parts to its peculiar mode of existence? Rising in the scale  of sensitive being, let us consider the beast of the forest, in whose  case, without microscopic aid, we have the subject more accessible. Is he  a beast of prey? Has the God of nature given him an instinctive thirst for  blood? Behold, then, his sharp-sighted organs of vision for descrying his  victim afar, his agile limbs for pursuit, his curved and pointed claws for  seizing and tearing his prey, his sharp-edged teeth for cutting through  its flesh, his firm jaws for gripping, crushing, and devouring it, and his  intestines for digesting raw flesh. But is he a graminivorous animal? Does  he subsist on grass and herb? Behold, then, his clumsy limbs and his  clawless hoofs, his blunt teeth and his herb-digesting stomach. So perfect  is the correspondence between one part and another; so exactly adapted are  all the parts to the same general objects; so wonderful is the harmony and  so definite and invariable the purpose obtaining throughout the whole,  that it is necessary to see but a footstep, or even a bone, to be able to  decide the nature and construction of the animal that imprinted that  footstep or that possessed that bone. Ascending still higher in the scale,  we come at last to man--man, the highest, noblest workmanship of God on  earth--the lord of this sphere terrene--for whose behoof all earthly things  exist. In common with all animals, he has that perfect adaptation of part  to part, and of all the parts to general objects, which demonstrate  consummate wisdom in the Cause which thus adapted them. His eyes are so  placed as to look the same way in which his feet are placed to walk, and  his hands to toil. His feet correspond with each other, being both placed  to walk in the direction, and with their corresponding sides towards one  another, without which he would hobble, even if he could walk at all. His  mouth is placed in the forepart of the head, by which it can receive food  and drink from the hands.    But the hands themselves--who can but admire their wonderful utility? To  what purpose are they not adapted? Man, who has many ends to accomplish,  in common with the beast of the field; who has hunger to alleviate, thirst  to slake, and has likewise other and higher ends, for the attainment of  which he is peculiarly qualified by means of _hands_. Adapted by his  constitution to inhabit all climes, he has hands to adapt his clothing to  the same, whether torrid, temperate or frigid. Possessed of the knowledge  of the utility of the soil, he has hands to cultivate it. Located far  distant oftentimes from the running stream, these hands enable him to"]]]
