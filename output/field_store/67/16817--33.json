Balzac (the elder), close to Malherbe in  time, performed a service for French prose similar to that which the  latter performed for French verse. These two critical and literary  powers brought in the reign of what is called classicism in France.  French classicism had its long culmination under Louis XIV.    But it was under Louis XIII., or rather under that monarch's great  minister, Cardinal Richelieu, that the rich and splendid Augustan age of  French literature was truly prepared. Two organized forces, one of them  private and social, the other official and public, worked together,  though sometimes perhaps not in harmony, to produce the magnificent  literary result that illustrated the time of Louis XIV. Of these two  organized forces, the Hotel de Rambouillet was one, and the French  Academy was the other. The Hotel de Rambouillet has become the adopted  name of a literary society, presided over by the fine inspiring genius  of the beautiful and accomplished Italian wife of the Marquis de  Rambouillet, a lady who generously conceived the idea of rallying the  feminine wit and virtue of the kingdom to exert a potent influence for  regenerating the manners and morals, and indeed the literature, of  France. At the high court of blended rank and fashion and beauty and  polish and virtue and wit, thus established in the exquisitely builded  and decorated saloons of the Rambouillet mansion, the selectest literary  genius and fame of France were proud and glad to assemble for the  discussion and criticism of literature. Here came Balzac and Voiture;  here Corneille read aloud his masterpieces before they were represented  on the stage; here Descartes philosophized; here the large and splendid  genius of Bossuet first unfolded itself to the world; here Madame de  Sevigne brought her bright, incisive wit, trebly commended by stainless  reputation, unwithering beauty, and charming address, in the woman who  wielded it. The noblest blood of France added the decoration and  inspiration of their presence. It is not easy to overrate the diffusive  beneficent influence that hence went forth to change the fashion of  literature, and to change the fashion of society, for the better. The  Hotel de Rambouillet proper lasted two generations only; but it had a  virtual succession, which, though sometimes interrupted, was scarcely  extinct until the brilliant and beautiful Madame Recamier ceased, about  the middle of the present century, to hold her famous _salons_ in Paris.  The continuous fame and influence of the French Academy, founded by  Richelieu, everybody knows. No other European language has been  elaborately and sedulously formed and cultivated like the French.    But great authors are better improvers of a language than any societies,  however influential. Corneille, Descartes, Pascal, did more for French  style than either the Hotel de Rambouillet or the Academy,--more than  both these two great literary societies together. In verse, Racine,  following Corneille, advanced in some important respects upon the  example and lead of that great original master; but in prose, when  Pascal published his \"Provincial Letters,\" French style reached at once  a point of perfection beyond which it never since has gone. Bossuet,  Bourdaloue, Fenelon, Massillon, Moliere, La Fontaine, Boileau, La  Rochefoucauld, La Bruyere,--what a constellation of names are these, to  glorify the age of Louis XIV.! And Louis XIV. himself, royal embodiment  of a literary good sense carried to the pitch of something very like  real genius in judgment and taste,--what a sun was he (with that talent  of his for kingship, probably never surpassed), to balance and to sway,  from his unshaken station, the august intellectual system of which he  alone constituted the despotic centre to attract and repel! Seventy-two  years long was this sole individual reign. Louis XIV. still sat on the  throne of France when the seventeenth century became the eighteenth.    The eighteenth century was an age of universal reaction in France.  Religion, or rather ecclesiasticism,--for, in the France of those times,  religion was the Church, and the Church was the Roman Catholic  hierarchy,--had been the dominant fashion under Louis XIV. Infidelity  was a broad literary mark, written all over the face of the eighteenth  century. It was the hour and power of the Encyclopaedists and the  Philosophers,--of Voltaire, of Diderot, of D'Alembert, of Rousseau.  Montesquieu, though contemporary, belongs apart from these writers. More  really original, more truly philosophical, he was far less  revolutionary, far less destructive, than they. Still, his influence  was, on the whole, exerted in the direction, if not of infidelity, at  least of religious indifferentism. The French Revolution was laid in  train by the great popular writers whom we have now named, and by their  fellows. It needed only the spark, which the proper occasion would be  sure soon to strike out, and the awful, earth-shaking explosion would  follow. After the Revolution, during the First Empire, so called,--the  usurpation, that is, of Napoleon Bonaparte,--literature was well-nigh  extinguished in France. The names, however, then surpassingly brilliant,  of Chateaubriand and Madame de Stael, belong to this period.    Three centuries have now elapsed since the date of \"The Pleiades.\"  Throughout this long period, French literature has been chiefly under  the sway of that spirit of classicism in style which the reaction  against Ronsardism, led first by Malherbe and afterwards by Boileau, had  established as the national standard in literary taste and aspiration.  But Rousseau's genius acted as a powerful solvent of the classic  tradition. Chateaubriand's influence was felt on the same side,  continuing Rousseau's. George Sand, too, and Lamartine, were forces that  strengthened this component. Finally, the great personality of Victor  Hugo proved potent enough definitively to break the spell that had been  so long and so heavily laid on the literary development of France. The  bloodless warfare was fierce between the revolutionary Romanticists and  the conservative Classicists in literary style, but the victory seemed  at last to remain with the advocates of the new romantic revival. It  looked, on the face of the matter, like a signal triumph of originality  over prescription, of genius over criticism, of power over rule. We  still live in the midst of the dying echoes of this resonant strife.  Perhaps it is too early, as yet, to determine on which side, by the  merit of the cause, the advantage truly belongs. But, by the merit of  the respective champions, the result was, for a time at least,  triumphantly decided in favor of the Romanticists, against the  Classicists. The weighty authority, however, of Sainte-Beuve, at first  thrown into the scale that at length would sink, was thence withdrawn,  and at last, if not resolutely cast upon the opposite side of the  balance, was left wavering in a kind of equipoise between the one and  the other. But our preliminary sketch has already passed the limit  within which our choice of authors for representation is necessarily  confined.    With first a few remarks, naturally suggested, that may be useful, on  the general subject thus rather touched merely than handled, the present  writer gives way to let now the representative authors themselves,  selected for the purpose, supply to the reader a just and lively idea of  French literature.    The first thing, perhaps, to strike the thoughtful mind in a  comprehensive view of the subject, is not so much the length--though  this is remarkable--as the long _continuity_ of French literary history.  From its beginning down to the actual moment, French literature has  suffered no serious break in the course of its development. There have  been periods of greater, and periods of less, prosperity and fruit; but  wastes of marked suspension and barrenness, there have been none.    The second thing noticeable is, that French literature has, to a  singular degree, lived an independent life of its own. It has found  copious springs of health and growth within its own bosom.    But then, a third thing to be also observed, is that, on the other hand,  the touch of foreign influence, felt and acknowledged by this most  proudly and self-sufficiently national of literatures, has proved to it,  at various epochs, a sovereign force of revival and elastic expansion.  Thus, the great renascence in the sixteenth century of ancient Greek and  Latin letters was new life to French literature. So, again, Spanish  literature, brought into contact with French through Corneille and  Moliere with others, gave to the national mind of France a new literary  launch. But the most recent and perhaps the most remarkable example of  foreign influence quickening French literature to make it freshly  fruitful, is supplied in the great romanticizing movement under the lead  of Victor Hugo. English literature--especially Shakspeare--was largely  the pregnant cause of this attempted emancipation of the French literary  mind from the burden of classicism.    A fourth very salient trait in French literary history consists in the  self-conscious, elaborate, persistent efforts put forth from time to  time by individuals, and by organizations, both public and private, in  France, to improve the language, and to elevate the literature, of the  nation. We know of nothing altogether comparable to this anywhere else  in the literature of the world.    A fifth striking thing about French literature is, that it has to a  degree, as we believe beyond parallel, exercised a real and vital  influence on the character and the fortune of the nation. The social,  the political, the moral, the religious, history of France is from age  to age a faithful reflex of the changing phases of its literature. Of  course, a reciprocal influence has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#3)"],[1," go to him  two hours every evening after I had done my work.  He then gave me five  pounds, advising me to rig myself out neatly; and he told me besides  that he had spoken to some of the boatmen in the neighbourhood, who he  thought were very likely to employ me if I applied to them.  After a few  more words of advice the good gentleman took his departure.    Now Mr Wells was a man of sound sense, and his conduct was, I have  reason to know, most judicious.  He saw that I was accustomed to act for  myself, young as I was, and that I should have less chance of slipping  off the ladder, if I mounted each ratlin by myself; and he considered  that as I was of somewhat a poetical temperament, if my mind received a  hot bed forcing at too early an age, I should be unfitted to struggle on  in this every-day working world.  Had he, as his wife recommended him,  sent me to a boarding school, where I should have had everything done  for me, I should probably very soon have lost that habit of dependence  on my own exertions which has been the great cause of my success in  life; and the routine style of education I should there have received  would certainly not have compensated for the loss of the other  advantage, nor would the amount of knowledge I should have gained have  been in all probability in any way equal to that I obtained from my  evenings' study with the good curate, Mr Hamlin.    Depend upon it, after children are shown what is right, the sooner they  are taught self-reliance the better.  It is the principle I have  followed out with my own, and they are now independent men, and are  grateful to me for it.  I began with them as soon as they were weaned;  before that time I did not consider I ought to interfere with my wife.  I never let one of them have a meal before he had performed some task  for it, nor a new frock or jacket.  Sometimes I would set a week's work,  and let them get through it as they liked, provided they had earned  their food.  I thus very early found out their characters, and the  amount of perseverance and energy they possessed, and managed them  accordingly.  They all got through their work in the set time, but in  different ways.  One would set to work the moment he knew what he was to  do, and toil away till it was completed; another would commence more  leisurely, then go to some other occupation or amusement, and then  return to his regular labours; a third would take the whole time to  complete the undertaking, but it was invariably done well.  I taught my  own boys the advantages of industry, and they soon learned to like  labour for itself.  They have never been idle, and consequently have  never been vicious.    For six or seven years I lived on with my old friends, spending all the  day on the river assisting the boatmen to take care of their boats, and,  as I grew bigger, in rowing, till I had saved enough money to get a  share of a boat myself, while every evening that Mr Hamlin was able to  receive me I paid him a visit.  At the time I was fourteen my wish to go  to sea, grew stronger than ever, and Mr Wells at once acceded to it,  and told me that he would gladly find me a berth in one of his own  vessels, for he was, what I forgot before to say, an extensive  shipowner.  He advised me to sell my share in the boat, and to invest  the amount, with my subsequent savings, in the savings bank, telling me  that he had such entire confidence in me that he would gladly advance  the money for my outfit.    I was accordingly entered as an apprentice, and made my first voyage, in  the good ship the _Mary Jane_, to the Brazils.  The next was round Cape  Horn to the coast of Chili and Peru, and on my return I made a trip up  the Baltic.  Indeed, for many years I was constantly at sea, during  which time I visited various parts of the world.    When I was out of my apprenticeship I began to lay by half of my wages,  and then to do a little trading on my own account, by which I made  money.  I at last worked my way from before the mast to the  quarter-deck, and became third officer of a fine ship trading to the  Cape.  I probably should have become master of her in time, but on my  return home I fell in love and married.  My wife was young, pretty, and  well educated according to my taste--that is to say, she had been  brought up at home by a good sensible mother, who never thought of  letting her learn to play on the piano, nor to dance, nor any  accomplishment useless to one in the rank she appeared destined to fill.  Her father was the owner and master of a small trader running between  London and Ramsgate.  After I married I made two more trips to the Cape,  and on my return from the second I found my father-in-law on the point  of death.  He made me promise to remain at home to take care of his  widow and daughter, and on these conditions made me over his vessel and  the goodwill of his trade.  For some years I followed this line with  varied success, but I did not save much money, as my family increased  rapidly, and my expenses were proportionably heavy.  I lost a  considerable part of my savings through the failure of my poor friend  Mr Wells, in whose hands my money was placed; but I did not repine at  this on my own account, for I considered that the lessons he had taught  me were of far more value than the amount of my wealth, but I grieved  deeply that he should be the sufferer.  He was by this time an old man,  and his creditors allowed him a comfortable income till his death.        CHAPTER THREE.    THE VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.    At length my vessel wore out, and I was compelled to build a new one.  She was a fine schooner of nearly sixty tons, and was a capital sea  boat.  I ran her for about three years, but I found that she was almost  too good for the trade she was engaged in.  At this time I met with an  old shipmate who had made several trips to New South Wales, or, as it  was then called commonly, to Botany Bay, and he gave me glowing accounts  of the success of some of the free settlers who had gone out there.  This made me think about the subject and set to work to collect  information from all the people I met who knew anything about the  country.  One and all combined in asserting that it was a very fine  country, and that large fortunes were to be made in one way or another,  but they chiefly spoke in praise of the fine pastures for sheep which  existed.  From what I could pick up, however, I surmised that the sheep  in general were of a very inferior quality, and that if some of the best  breeds could be introduced, not only would the colony be benefited, but  the person who brought them over.  For some weeks I turned the subject  in my mind.  I had plenty of time to think about it in my passages up  and down the river when obliged to bring up for the tide, and at last I  broached it to my wife, and told her that my opinion was that a far  better livelihood might be made in the new country than such people as  ourselves could hope for in England.    \"You see how it is, my dear Martha,\" I said, \"for many years your good  father toiled on in this trade, and though he lived comfortably and  brought you up well, he saved no money; and had he met with any reverse  like the loss of his vessel the case might have been different, and he  might easily have been ruined.  Now, although I have worked harder than  he was able to do, and consequently have kept my head above water, with  a large family and greater expenses, I also have saved little, and am  sadly puzzled to know what to do with our boys, and I shall be unwilling  to send our pretty girls out to service; yet if they do not marry I can  never expect to leave enough to support them.    \"I have been thinking of a hundred different ways of improving our  fortune in England, but not one has occurred to me in which the risk of  loss has not been too great.  Thousands of families are exactly in our  position, and the fathers must feel that not only have they no chance of  rising in the world, but that when they die they must leave their  daughters exposed to all the dangers of a life of dependence.  For the  boys I fear less; they will if they survive make their own way in life  as I have done, and are more fitted to bear its ups and downs.  Now, my  dear wife, I know you would be ready to follow me to the end of the  world, even if it were to penury or death, but I am not going to ask you  to do that.  I am going to propose to go to a far distant land, where I  trust we shall not only gain wealth, but happiness and contentment, and  see our family happily settled.\"    My wife, as I knew she would be, was ready to enter into my views,  though, as she had never been at sea further than Ramsgate, she could  not help looking with some dread at the long voyage, and she had read  some rather exaggerated accounts of bush-rangers and savages in Botany  Bay which were enough to frighten her.  I soon, however, quieted all her  fears about the voyage as well as about the savages and bush-rangers,  and though I did not conceal from her that there were many difficulties  to be overcome, and dangers to be encountered, I pictured the future to  her in the bright colours it appeared to my own imagination.  My eldest  boy was at sea, but we expected his return every day, and at all events  I determined to wait his arrival.  The two next were accustomed to sail  with me in the schooner, where I did my beat to give them all the  learning I had gained from the good curate, Mr Hamlin, and had since  then picked up by my own exertions.  Though they were still boys, they  were very useful on board, and could take the helm and work the vessel  as well as any grownup man.  I had eight of them, four boys and four  girls, and the two youngest were still children.  The elder ones were  delighted at my proposal,--the boy, at the thought of making a long sea  voyage, of seeing strange lands, and hunting the kangaroo; the girl, at  being able "]]]
