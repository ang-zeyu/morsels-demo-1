Do not shoot at  his heart, but at the crest of feathers on his head. He can be wounded  there, but not in his heart.\"    The warrior was not so proud that he could not listen to a little bird.  The magician bent to lift a stone, and an arrow flew from the warrior's  bow. It buzzed and stung like a wasp. It came so close to the crest of  feathers that the magician trembled with terror. Before he could run,  another arrow came, and this one struck him right on his crest. His  heart grew cold with fear. \"Death has struck me,\" he cried.    \"Your cruel life is over,\" said the warrior. \"People shall no longer  fear your fatal breath.\" Then he said to the woodpecker, \"Little bird,  you have been a good friend to me, and I will do all that I can for  you.\" He put some of the red blood of the magician upon the little  creature's head. It made the crest of feathers there as red as flame.  \"Whenever a man looks upon you,\" said the warrior, \"he will say, 'That  bird is our friend. He helped to kill the cruel magician.'\"    The little woodpecker was very proud of his red crest because it showed  that he was the friend of man, and all his children to this day are as  proud as he was.    [Illustration]          WHY THE CAT ALWAYS FALLS UPON HER FEET.      Some magicians are cruel, but others are gentle and good to all the  creatures of the earth. One of these good magicians was one day  traveling in a great forest. The sun rose high in the heavens, and he  lay down at the foot of a tree. Soft, green moss grew all about him. The  sun shining through the leaves made flecks of light and shadow upon the  earth. He heard the song of the bird and the lazy buzz of the wasp. The  wind rustled the leafy boughs above him. All the music of the forest  lulled him to slumber, and he closed his eyes.    As the magician lay asleep, a great serpent came softly from the  thicket. It lifted high its shining crest and saw the man at the foot of  the tree. \"I will kill him!\" it hissed. \"I could have eaten that cat  last night if he had not called, 'Watch, little cat, watch!' I will kill  him, I will kill him!\"    Closer and closer the deadly serpent moved. The magician stirred in his  sleep. \"Watch, little cat, watch!\" he said softly. The serpent drew  back, but the magician's eyes were shut, and it went closer. It hissed  its war-cry. The sleeping magician did not move. The serpent was upon  him--no, far up in the high branches of the tree above his head the  little cat lay hidden. She had seen the serpent when it came from the  thicket.    [Illustration: SHE LEAPED DOWN UPON THE SERPENT]    She watched it as it went closer and closer to the sleeping man, and she  heard it hiss its war-cry. The little cat's body quivered with anger and  with fear, for she was so little and the serpent was so big. \"The  magician was very good to me,\" she thought, and she leaped down upon the  serpent.    Oh, how angry the serpent was! It hissed, and the flames shot from its  eyes. It struck wildly at the brave little cat, but now the cat had no  fear. Again and again she leaped upon the serpent's head, and at last  the creature lay dead beside the sleeping man whom it had wished to  kill.    When the magician awoke, the little cat lay on the earth, and not far  away was the dead serpent. He knew at once what the cat had done, and he  said, \"Little cat, what can I do to show you honor for your brave fight?  Your eyes are quick to see, and your ears are quick to hear. You can run  very swiftly. I know what I can do for you. You shall be known over the  earth as the friend of man, and you shall always have a home in the  home of man. And one thing more, little cat: you leaped from the high  tree to kill the deadly serpent, and now as long as you live, you shall  leap where you will, and you shall always fall upon your feet.\"          WHY THE SWALLOW'S TAIL IS FORKED.      This is the story of how the swallow's tail came to be forked.    One day the Great Spirit asked all the animals that he had made to come  to his lodge. Those that could fly came first: the robin, the bluebird,  the owl, the butterfly, the wasp, and the firefly. Behind them came the  chicken, fluttering its wings and trying hard to keep up. Then came the  deer, the squirrel, the serpent, the cat, and the rabbit. Last of all  came the bear, the beaver, and the hedgehog. Every one traveled as  swiftly as he could, for each wished to hear the words of the Great  Spirit.    \"I have called you together,\" said the Great Spirit, \"because I often  hear you scold and fret. What do you wish me to do for you? How can I  help you?\"    \"I do not like to hunt so long for my food,\" said the bear.    \"I do not like to build nests,\" said the bluebird.    \"I do not like to live in the water,\" said the beaver.    \"And I do not like to live in a tree,\" said the squirrel.    At last man stood erect before the Great Spirit and said, \"O Great  Father, the serpent feasts upon my blood. Will you not give him some  other food?\"    \"And why?\" asked the Great Spirit.    \"Because I am the first of all the creatures you have made,\" answered  man proudly.    Then every animal in the lodge was angry to hear the words of man. The  squirrel chattered, the wasp buzzed, the owl hooted, and the serpent  hissed.    \"Hush, be still,\" said the Great Spirit. \"You are, O man, the first of  my creatures, but I am the father of all. Each one has his rights, and  the serpent must have his food. Mosquito, you are a great traveler. Now  fly away and find what creature's blood is best for the serpent. Do you  all come back in a year and a day.\"    The animals straightway went to their homes. Some went to the river,  some to the forest, and some to the prairie, to wait for the day when  they must meet at the lodge of the Great Spirit.    The mosquito traveled over the earth and stung every creature that he  met to find whose blood was the best for the serpent. On his way back to  the lodge of the Great Spirit he looked up into the sky, and there was  the swallow.    \"Good-day, swallow,\" called the mosquito.    \"I am glad to see you, my friend,\" sang the swallow. \"Are you going to  the lodge of the Great Spirit? And have you found out whose blood is  best for the serpent?\"    \"The blood of man,\" answered the mosquito.    The mosquito did not like man, but the swallow had always been his  friend. \"What can I do to help man?\" he thought. \"Oh, I know what I can  do.\" Then he asked the mosquito, \"Whose blood did you say?\"    \"Man's blood,\" said the mosquito; \"that is best.\"    \"_This_ is best,\" said the swallow, and he tore out the mosquito's  tongue.    The mosquito buzzed angrily and went quickly to the Great Spirit.    \"All the animals are here,\" said the Great Spirit. \"They are waiting to  hear whose blood is best for the serpent.\"    The mosquito tried to answer, \"The blood of man,\" but he could not say a  word. He could make no sound but \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\"    \"What do you say?\"    \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\" buzzed the mosquito angrily.    All the creatures wondered. Then said the swallow:--    \"Great Father, the mosquito is timid and cannot answer you. I met him  before we came, and he told me whose blood it was.\"    \"Then let us know at once,\" said the Great Spirit.    [Illustration]    \"It is the blood of the frog,\" answered the swallow quickly. \"Is it not  so, friend mosquito?\"    \"Kss-ksss-ksssss!\" hissed the angry mosquito.    \"The serpent shall have the frog's blood,\" said the Great Spirit. \"Man  shall be his food no longer.\"    Now the serpent was angry with the swallow, for he did not like frog's  blood. As the swallow flew near him, he seized him by the tail and tore  away a little of it. This is why the swallow's tail is forked, and it is  why man always looks upon the swallow as his friend.          WHY THE WHITE HARES HAVE BLACK EARS.      In the forest there is a beautiful spirit. All the beasts and all the  birds are dear to him, and he likes to have them gentle and good. One  morning he saw some of his little white hares fighting one another, and  each trying to seize the best of the food.    \"Oh, my selfish little hares,\" he said sadly, \"why do you fight and try  to seize the best of everything for yourselves? Why do you not live in  love together?\"    \"Tell us a story and we will be good,\" cried the hares.    Then the spirit of the forest was glad. \"I will tell you a story of how  you first came to live on the green earth with the other animals,\" he  said, \"and why it is that you are white, and the other hares are not.\"    Then the little hares came close about the spirit of the forest, and sat  very still to hear the story.    \"Away up above the stars,\" the gentle spirit began, \"the sky children  were all together one snowy day. They threw snowflakes at one another,  and some of the snowflakes fell from the sky. They came down swiftly  between the stars and among the branches of the trees. At last they lay  on the green earth. They were the first that had ever come to the earth,  and no one knew what they were. The swallow asked, 'What are they?' and  the butterfly answered, 'I do not know.' The spirit of the sky was  listening, and he said, 'We call them snowflakes.'    \"'I never heard of snowflakes. Are they birds or beasts?' asked the  butterfly.    \"'They are snowflakes,' answered the spirit of the sky, 'but they are  magic snowflakes. Watch them closely.'    \"The swallow and the butterfly watched. Every snowflake showed two  bright eyes, then two long ears, then some soft feet, and there were the  whitest, softest little hares that were ever seen.\"    \"Were we the little white hares?\" asked the listeners.    \"You were the little white hares,\" answered the spirit, \"and if you are  gentle and good, you will always be white.\"    The hares were not gentle and good; they were fretful, and before long  they were scolding and fighting again.

It must  also be admitted that some of these pioneers of evolutionism did more  than apply the evolution-idea as a modal formula of becoming, they  began to inquire into the factors in the process. Thus there were  pre-Darwinian theories of evolution, and to these we must now briefly  refer.[15]    In all biological thinking we have to work with the categories  Organism--Function--Environment, and theories of evolution may be  classified in relation to these. To some it has always seemed that the  fundamental fact is the living organism,--a creative agent, a striving  will, a changeful Proteus, selecting its environment, adjusting itself  to it, self-differentiating and self-adaptive. The necessity of  recognising the importance of the organism is admitted by all  Darwinians who start with inborn variations, but it is open to  question whether the whole truth of what we might call the Goethian  position is exhausted in the postulate of inherent variability.    To others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on  Function,--on use and disuse, on doing and not doing. Practice makes  perfect; _c'est a force de forger qu'on devient forgeron_. This is one  of the fundamental ideas of Lamarckism; to some extent it met with  Darwin's approval; and it finds many supporters to-day. One of the  ablest of these--Mr. Francis Darwin--has recently given strong reasons  for combining a modernised Lamarckism with what we usually regard as  sound Darwinism.[16]    To others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on the  Environment, which wakes the organism to action, prompts it to change,  makes dints upon it, moulds it, prunes it, and finally, perhaps, kills it.  It is again impossible to doubt that there is truth in this view, for even  if environmentally induced \"modifications\" be not transmissible,  environmentally induced \"variations\" are; and even if the direct influence  of the environment be less important than many enthusiastic supporters of  this view--may we call them Buffonians--think, there remains the indirect  influence which Darwinians in part rely on,--the eliminative process. Even  if the extreme view be held that the only form of discriminate elimination  that counts is inter-organismal competition, this might be included under  the rubric of the animate environment.    In many passages Buffon[17] definitely suggested that environmental  influences--especially of climate and food--were directly productive  of changes in organisms, but he did not discuss the question of the  transmissibility of the modifications so induced, and it is difficult  to gather from his inconsistent writings what extent of transformation  he really believed in. Prof. Osborn says of Buffon: \"The struggle for  existence, the elimination of the least-perfected species, the contest  between the fecundity of certain species and their constant  destruction, are all clearly expressed in various passages.\" He quotes  two of these:[18]    \"Le cours ordinaire de la nature vivante, est en general toujours  constant, toujours le meme; son mouvement, toujours regulier, roule  sur deux points inebranlables: l'un, la fecondite sans bornes donnee a  toutes les especes; l'autre, les obstacles sans nombre qui reduisent  cette fecondite a une mesure determinee et ne laissent en tout temps  qu'a peu pres la meme quantite d'individus de chaque espece\" ... \"Les  especes les moins parfaites, les plus delicates, les plus pesantes,  les moins agissantes, les moins armees, etc., ont deja disparu ou  disparaitront.\".    Erasmus Darwin[19] had a firm grip of the \"idea of the gradual  formation and improvement of the Animal world,\" and he had his theory  of the process. No sentence is more characteristic than this: \"All  animals undergo transformations which are in part produced by their  own exertions, in response to pleasures and pains, and many of these  acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity.\"  This is Lamarckism before Lamarck, as his grandson pointed out. His  central idea is that wants stimulate efforts and that these result in  improvements which subsequent generations make better still. He  realised something of the struggle for existence and even pointed out  that this advantageously checks the rapid multiplication. \"As Dr.  Krause points out, Darwin just misses the connection between this  struggle and the Survival of the Fittest.\"[20]    Lamarck[21] (1744-1829) seems to have thought out his theory of  evolution without any knowledge of Erasmus Darwin's which it closely  resembled. The central idea of his theory was the cumulative  inheritance of functional modifications. \"Changes in environment bring  about changes in the habits of animals. Changes in their wants  necessarily bring about parallel changes in their habits. If new wants  become constant or very lasting, they form new habits, the new habits  involve the use of new parts, or a different use of old parts, which  results finally in the production of new organs and the modification  of old ones.\" He differed from Buffon in not attaching importance, as  far as animals are concerned, to the direct influence of the  environment, \"for environment can effect no direct change whatever  upon the organisation of animals,\" but in regard to plants he agreed  with Buffon that external conditions directly moulded them.    Treviranus[22] (1776-1837), whom Huxley ranked beside Lamarck, was on  the whole Buffonian, attaching chief importance to the influence of a  changeful environment both in modifying and in eliminating, but he was  also Goethian, for instance in his idea that species like individuals  pass through periods of growth, full bloom, and decline. \"Thus, it is  not only the great catastrophes of Nature which have caused  extinction, but the completion of cycles of existence, out of which  new cycles have begun.\" A characteristic sentence is quoted by Prof.  Osborn: \"In every living being there exists a capability of an endless  variety of form-assumption; each possesses the power to adapt its  organisation to the changes of the outer world, and it is this power,  put into action by the change of the universe, that has raised the  simple zoophytes of the primitive world to continually higher stages  of organisation, and has introduced a countless variety of species  into animate Nature.\"    Goethe[23] (1749-1832), who knew Buffon's work but not Lamarck's, is  peculiarly interesting as one of the first to use the evolution-idea  as a guiding hypothesis, e.g. in the interpretation of vestigial  structures in man, and to realise that organisms express an attempt to  make a compromise between specific inertia and individual change. He  gave the finest expression that science has yet known--if it has known  it--of the kernel-idea of what is called \"bathmism,\" the idea of an  \"inherent growth-force\"--and at the same time he held that \"the way of  life powerfully reacts upon all form\" and that the orderly growth of  form \"yields to change from externally acting causes.\"    Besides Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, Treviranus, and Goethe,  there were other \"pioneers of evolution,\" whose views have been often  discussed and appraised. Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1884),  whose work Goethe so much admired, was on the whole Buffonian,  emphasising the direct action of the changeful _milieu_. \"Species vary  with their environment, and existing species have descended by  modification from earlier and somewhat simpler species.\" He had a  glimpse of the selection idea, and believed in mutations or sudden  leaps--induced in the embryonic condition by external influences. The  complete history of evolution-theories will include many instances of  guesses at truth which were afterwards substantiated, thus the  geographer von Buch (1773-1853) detected the importance of the  Isolation factor on which Wagner, Romanes, Gulick and others have laid  great stress, but we must content ourselves with recalling one other  pioneer, the author of the _Vestiges of Creation_ (1844), a work which  passed through ten editions in nine years and certainly helped to  harrow the soil for Darwin's sowing. As Darwin said, \"it did excellent  service in this country in calling attention to the subject, in  removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception  of analogous views.\"[24] Its author, Robert Chambers (1802-1871) was  in part a Buffonian--maintaining that environment moulded organisms  adaptively, and in part a Goethian--believing in an inherent  progressive impulse which lifted organisms from one grade of  organisation to another.      _As Regards Natural Selection_    The only thinker to whom Darwin was directly indebted, so far as the  theory of Natural Selection is concerned, was Malthus, and we may once  more quote the well-known passage in the Autobiography: \"In October,  1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry,  I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,' and being  well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which  everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of  animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these  circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and  unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the  formation of new species.\"[25]    Although Malthus gives no adumbration of the idea of Natural Selection  in his exposition of the eliminative processes which go on in mankind,  the suggestive value of his essay is undeniable, as is strikingly  borne out by the fact that it gave to Alfred Russel Wallace also \"the  long-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic  species.\"[26] One day in Ternate when he was resting between fits of  fever, something brought to his recollection the work of Malthus which  he had read twelve years before. \"I thought of his"]]]
