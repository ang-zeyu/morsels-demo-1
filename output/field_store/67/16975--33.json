[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#3)"],[1,"the abbe de Ganges, to come and live  with him. He had a third brother, who, as the second son, bore the title  of comte, and who was colonel of the Languedoc regiment, but as this  gentleman played no part in this story we shall not concern ourselves  with him.    The abbe de Ganges, who bore that title without belonging to the Church,  had assumed it in order to enjoy its privileges: he was a kind of wit,  writing madrigals and 'bouts-rimes' [Bouts-rimes are verses written to a  given set of rhymes.] on occasion, a handsome man enough, though in  moments of impatience his eyes would take a strangely cruel expression;  as dissolute and shameless to boot, as though he had really belonged to  the clergy of the period.    The chevalier de Ganges, who shared in some measure the beauty so  profusely showered upon the family, was one of those feeble men who  enjoy their own nullity, and grow on to old age inapt alike for good and  evil, unless some nature of a stronger stamp lays hold on them and drags  them like faint and pallid satellites in its wake. This was what befell  the chevalier in respect of his brother: submitted to an influence of  which he himself was not aware, and against which, had he but suspected  it, he would have rebelled with the obstinacy of a child, he was a  machine obedient to the will of another mind and to the passions of  another heart, a machine which was all the more terrible in that no  movement of instinct or of reason could, in his case, arrest the impulse  given.    Moreover, this influence which the abbe had acquired over the chevalier  extended, in some degree also, to the marquis. Having as a younger son  no fortune, having no revenue, for though he wore a Churchman's robes he  did not fulfil a Churchman's functions, he had succeeded in persuading  the marquis, who was rich, not only in the enjoyment of his own fortune,  but also in that of his wife, which was likely to be nearly doubled at  the death of M. de Nocheres, that some zealous man was needed who would  devote himself to the ordering of his house and the management of his  property; and had offered himself for the post. The marquis had very  gladly accepted, being, as we have said, tired by this time of his  solitary home life; and the abbe had brought with him the chevalier, who  followed him like his shadow, and who was no more regarded than if he  had really possessed no body.    The marquise often confessed afterwards that when she first saw these  two men, although their outward aspect was perfectly agreeable, she felt  herself seized by a painful impression, and that the fortune-teller's  prediction of a violent death, which she had so long forgotten, gashed  out like lightning before her eyes. The effect on the two brothers was  not of the same kind: the beauty of the marquise struck them both,  although in different ways. The chevalier was in ecstasies of  admiration, as though before a beautiful statue, but the impression that  she made upon him was that which would have been made by marble, and if  the chevalier had been left to himself the consequences of this  admiration would have been no less harmless. Moreover, the chevalier did  not attempt either to exaggerate or to conceal this impression, and  allowed his sister-in-law to see in what manner she struck him. The  abbe, on the contrary, was seized at first sight with a deep and violent  desire to possess this woman--the most beautiful whom he had ever met;  but being as perfectly capable of mastering his sensations as the  chevalier was incapable, he merely allowed such words of compliment to  escape him as weigh neither with him who utters nor her who hears them;  and yet, before the close of this first interview, the abbe had decided  in his irrevocable will that this woman should be his.    As for the marquise, although the impression produced by her two  brothers-in-law could never be entirely effaced, the wit of the abbe, to  which he gave, with amazing facility, whatever turn he chose, and the  complete nullity of the chevalier brought her to certain feelings of  less repulsion towards them: for indeed the marquise had one of those  souls which never suspect evil, as long as it will take the trouble to  assume any veil at all of seeming, and which only recognise it with  regret when it resumes its true shape.    Meanwhile the arrival of these two new inmates soon spread a little more  life and gaiety through the house. Furthermore; greatly to the  astonishment of the marquise, her husband, who had so long been  indifferent to her beauty, seemed to remark afresh that she was too  charming to be despised; his words accordingly began little by little to  express an affection that had long since gradually disappeared from  them. The marquise had never ceased to love him; she had suffered the  loss of his love with resignation, she hailed its return with joy, and  three months elapsed that resembled those which had long ceased to be  more to the poor wife than a distant and half-worn-out memory.    Thus she had, with the supreme facility of youth, always ready to be  happy, taken up her gladness again, without even asking what genius had  brought back to her the treasure which she had thought lost, when she  received an invitation from a lady of the neighbourhood to spend some  days in her country house. Her husband and her two brothers-in-law,  invited with her, were of the party, and accompanied her. A great  hunting party had been arranged beforehand, and almost immediately upon  arriving everyone began to prepare for taking part in it.    The abbe, whose talents had made him indispensable in every company,  declared that for that day he was the marquise's cavalier, a title which  his sister-in-law, with her usual amiability, confirmed. Each of the  huntsmen, following this example, made choice of a lady to whom to  dedicate his attentions throughout the day; then, this chivalrous  arrangement being completed, all present directed their course towards  the place of meeting.    That happened which almost always happens the dogs hunted on their own  account. Two or three sportsmen only followed the dogs; the rest got  lost. The abbe, in his character of esquire to the marquise, had not  left her for a moment, and had managed so cleverly that he was alone  with her--an opportunity which he had been seeking for a month  previously with no less care--than the marquise had been using to avoid  it. No sooner, therefore, did the marquise believe herself aware that  the abbe had intentionally turned aside from the hunt than she attempted  to gallop her horse in the opposite direction from that which she had  been following; but the abbe stopped her. The marquise neither could nor  would enter upon a struggle; she resigned herself, therefore, to hearing  what the abbe had to say to her, and her face assumed that air of  haughty disdain which women so well know how to put on when they wish a  man to understand that he has nothing to hope from them. There was an  instant's silence; the abbe was the first to break it.    \"Madame,\" said he, \"I ask your pardon for having used this means to  speak to you alone; but since, in spite of my rank of brother-in-law,  you did not seem inclined to grant me that favour if I had asked it, I  thought it would be better for me, to deprive you of the power to refuse  it me.\"    \"If you have hesitated to ask me so simple a thing, monsieur,\" replied  the marquise, \"and if you have taken such precautions to compel me to  listen to you, it must, no doubt, be because you knew beforehand that  the words you had to say to me were such as I could not hear. Have the  goodness, therefore, to reflect, before you open this conversation, that  here as elsewhere I reserve the right--and I warn you of it--to  interrupt what you may say at the moment when it may cease to seem to me  befitting.\"    \"As to that, madame,\" said the abbe, \"I think I can answer for it that  whatever it may please me to say to you, you will hear to the end; but  indeed the matters are so simple that there is no need to make you  uneasy beforehand: I wished to ask you, madame, whether you have  perceived a change in the conduct of your husband towards you.\"    \"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the marquise, \"and no single day has passed in  which I have not thanked Heaven for this happiness.\"    \"And you have been wrong, madame,\" returned the abbe, with one of those  smiles that were peculiar to himself; \"Heaven has nothing to do with it.  Thank Heaven for having made you the most beautiful and charming of  women, and that will be enough thanksgiving without despoiling me of  such as belong to my share.\"    \"I do not understand you, monsieur,\" said the marquise in an icy tone.    \"Well, I will make myself comprehensible, my dear sister-in-law. I am  the worker of the miracle for which you are thanking Heaven; to me  therefore belongs your gratitude. Heaven is rich enough not to rob the  poor.\"    \"You are right, monsieur: if it is really to you that I owe this return,  the cause of which I did not know, I will thank you in the first place;  and then afterwards I will thank Heaven for having inspired you with  this good thought.\"    \"Yes,\" answered the abbe, \"but Heaven, which has inspired me with a good  thought, may equally well inspire me with a bad one, if the good thought  does not bring me what I expect from it.\"    \"What do you mean, monsieur?\"    \"That there has never been more than one will in the family, and that  will is mine; that the minds of my two brothers turn according to the  fancy of that will like weathercocks before the wind, and that he who  has blown hot can blow cold.\"    \"I am still waiting for you to explain yourself, monsieur.\"    \"Well, then, my dear sister-in-law, since you are pleased not to  understand me, I will explain myself more clearly. My brother turned  from you through jealousy; I wished to give you an idea of my power over  him, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#3)"],[1,"of which were  mounted silently and somewhat slowly; for Baisemeaux, though far from  disobeying, was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey. On arriving  at the door, Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner's  chamber; but Aramis, stopping him on the threshold, said, \"The rules do  not allow the governor to hear the prisoner's confession.\"    Baisemeaux bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and  entered; and then signed to them to close the door behind him. For  an instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and the  turnkey had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their  descending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern  on the table and gazed around. On a bed of green serge, similar in all  respect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that it was newer, and  under curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we have already  once before introduced Aramis. According to custom, the prisoner was  without a light. At the hour of curfew, he was bound to extinguish his  lamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed to keep  it burning even till then. Near the bed a large leathern armchair,  with twisted legs, sustained his clothes. A little table--without pens,  books, paper, or ink--stood neglected in sadness near the window; while  several plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had scarcely  touched his evening meal. Aramis saw that the young man was stretched  upon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms. The arrival of a  visitor did not caused any change of position; either he was waiting in  expectation, or was asleep. Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern,  pushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture  of interest and respect. The young man raised his head. \"What is it?\"  said he.    \"You desired a confessor?\" replied Aramis.    \"Yes.\"    \"Because you were ill?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Very ill?\"    The young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, \"I thank  you.\" After a moment's silence, \"I have seen you before,\" he continued.  Aramis bowed.    Doubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty,  and imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of  Vannes was little reassuring to one in his situation, for he added, \"I  am better.\"    \"And so?\" said Aramis.    \"Why, then--being better, I have no longer the same need of a confessor,  I think.\"    \"Not even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread  informed you of?\"    The young man started; but before he had either assented or denied,  Aramis continued, \"Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to  hear an important revelation?\"    \"If it be so,\" said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, \"it is  different; I am listening.\"    Aramis then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy  majesty of his mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven  has implanted it in the blood or heart. \"Sit down, monsieur,\" said the  prisoner.    Aramis bowed and obeyed. \"How does the Bastile agree with you?\" asked  the bishop.    \"Very well.\"    \"You do not suffer?\"    \"No.\"    \"You have nothing to regret?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"Not even your liberty?\"    \"What do you call liberty, monsieur?\" asked the prisoner, with the tone  of a man who is preparing for a struggle.    \"I call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness  of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish  to carry you.\"    The young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was  difficult to tell. \"Look,\" said he, \"I have in that Japanese vase two  roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor's garden;  this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath  my gaze; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their  perfumes, filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it. Look now  on these two roses; even among roses these are beautiful, and the rose  is the most beautiful of flowers. Why, then, do you bid me desire other  flowers when I possess the loveliest of all?\"    Aramis gazed at the young man in surprise.    \"If _flowers_ constitute liberty,\" sadly resumed the captive, \"I am  free, for I possess them.\"    \"But the air!\" cried Aramis; \"air is so necessary to life!\"    \"Well, monsieur,\" returned the prisoner; \"draw near to the window; it is  open. Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages  of hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle  breezes. It caresses my face. When mounted on the back of this armchair,  with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I fancy  I am swimming the wide expanse before me.\" The countenance of Aramis  darkened as the young man continued: \"Light I have! what is better than  light? I have the sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without  the permission of the governor or the jailer's company. He comes in  at the window, and traces in my room a square the shape of the window,  which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor. This  luminous square increases from ten o'clock till midday, and decreases  from one till three slowly, as if, having hastened to my presence, it  sorrowed at bidding me farewell. When its last ray disappears I have  enjoyed its presence for five hours. Is not that sufficient? I have been  told that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who  toil in mines, who never behold it at all.\" Aramis wiped the drops from  his brow. \"As to the stars which are so delightful to view,\" continued  the young man, \"they all resemble each other save in size and  brilliancy. I am a favored mortal, for if you had not lighted that  candle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was  gazing at from my couch before your arrival, whose silvery rays were  stealing through my brain.\"    Aramis lowered his head; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter  flow of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive.    \"So much, then, for the flowers, the air, the daylight, and the stars,\"  tranquilly continued the young man; \"there remains but exercise. Do  I not walk all day in the governor's garden if it is fine--here if it  rains? in the fresh air if it is warm; in perfect warmth, thanks to my  winter stove, if it be cold? Ah! monsieur, do you fancy,\" continued the  prisoner, not without bitterness, \"that men have not done everything for  me that a man can hope for or desire?\"    \"Men!\" said Aramis; \"be it so; but it seems to me you are forgetting  Heaven.\"    \"Indeed I have forgotten Heaven,\" murmured the prisoner, with emotion;  \"but why do you mention it? Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of  Heaven?\"    Aramis looked steadily at this singular youth, who possessed the  resignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist. \"Is not Heaven in  everything?\" he murmured in a reproachful tone.    \"Say rather, at the end of everything,\" answered the prisoner, firmly.    \"Be it so,\" said Aramis; \"but let us return to our starting-point.\"    \"I ask nothing better,\" returned the young man.    \"I am your confessor.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then, you ought, as a penitent, to tell me the truth.\"    \"My whole desire is to tell it you.\"    \"Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been  imprisoned. What crime, then, have you committed?\"    \"You asked me the same question the first time you saw me,\" returned the  prisoner.    \"And then, as now you evaded giving me an answer.\"    \"And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you?\"    \"Because this time I am your confessor.\"    \"Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed, explain to  me in what a crime consists. For as my conscience does not accuse me, I  aver that I am not a criminal.\"    \"We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth, not  alone for having ourselves committed crimes, but because we know that  crimes have been committed.\"    The prisoner manifested the deepest attention.    \"Yes, I understand you,\" he said, after a pause; \"yes, you are right,  monsieur; it is very possible that, in such a light, I am a criminal in  the eyes of the great of the earth.\"    \"Ah! then you know something,\" said Aramis, who thought he had pierced  not merely through a defect in the harness, but through the joints of  it.    \"No, I am not aware of anything,\" replied the young man; \"but sometimes  I think--and I say to myself--\"    \"What do you say to yourself?\"    \"That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad  or I should divine a great deal.\"    \"And then--and then?\" said Aramis, impatiently.    \"Then I leave off.\"    \"You leave off?\"    \"Yes; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy; I feel _ennui_  overtaking me; I wish--\"    \"What?\"    \"I don't know; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things  which I do not possess, when I am so happy with what I have.\"    \"You are afraid of death?\" said Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.    \"Yes,\" said the young man, smiling.    Aramis felt the chill of that smile, and shuddered. \"Oh, as you fear  death, you know more about matters than you say,\" he cried.    \"And you,\" returned the prisoner, \"who bade me to ask to see you;  you, who, when I did ask to see you, came here promising a world of  confidence; how is it that, nevertheless, it is you who are silent,  leaving it for me to speak? Since, then, we both wear masks, either let  us both retain them or put them aside together.\"    Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark, saying to himself,  \"This is no ordinary man; I must be cautious.--Are you ambitious?\"  said he suddenly to the prisoner, aloud, without preparing him for the  alteration.    \"What do you mean by ambitious?\" replied the youth.    \"Ambition,\" replied Aramis, \"is the feeling which prompts a man"]]]
