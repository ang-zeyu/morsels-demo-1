A worthy son  of his father, he had commenced life in the fashion of the heroes of  ancient Greece, stealing sheep and goats, and from the age of fourteen  years he had acquired an equal reputation to that earned by the son of  Jupiter and Maia. When he grew to manhood, he extended his operations.  At the time of which we are speaking, he had long practised open  pillage. His plundering expeditions added to his mother's savings, who  since her return from Kardiki had altogether withdrawn from public life,  and devoted herself to household duties, enabled him to collect a  considerable force for am expedition against Kormovo, one of the two  towns he had sworn to destroy. He marched against it at the head of his  banditti, but found himself vigorously opposed, lost part of his force,  and was obliged to save himself and the rest by flight. He did not stop  till he reached Tepelen, where he had a warm reception from Kamco, whose  thirst for vengeance had been disappointed by his defeat. \"Go!\" said  she, \"go, coward! go spin with the women in the harem! The distaff is a  better weapon for you than the scimitar!\" The young man answered not a  word, but, deeply wounded by these reproaches, retired to hide his  humiliation in the bosom of his old friend the mountain. The popular  legend, always thirsting for the marvellous in the adventures of heroes,  has it that he found in the ruins of a church a treasure which enabled  him to reconstitute his party. But he himself has contradicted this  story, stating that it was by the ordinary methods of rapine and plunder  that he replenished his finances. He selected from his old band of  brigands thirty palikars, and entered, as their bouloubachi, or leader  of the group, into the service of the Pacha of Negropont. But he soon  tired of the methodical life he was obliged to lead, and passed into  Thessaly, where, following the example of his father Veli, he employed  his time in brigandage on the highways. Thence he raided the Pindus  chain of mountains, plundered a great number of villages, and returned  to Tepelen, richer and consequently more esteemed than ever.    He employed his fortune and influence in collecting a formidable  guerilla force, and resumed his plundering operations. Kurd Pacha soon  found himself compelled, by the universal outcry of the province, to  take active measures against this young brigand. He sent against him a  division of troops, which defeated him and brought him prisoner with his  men to Berat, the capital of Central Albania and residence of the  governor. The country flattered itself that at length it was freed from  its scourge. The whole body of bandits was condemned to death; but Ali  was not the man to surrender his life so easily. Whilst they were  hanging his comrades, he threw himself at the feet of the pacha and  begged for mercy in the name of his parents, excusing himself on account  of his youth, and promising a lasting reform. The pacha, seeing at his  feet a comely youth, with fair hair and blue eyes, a persuasive voice,  and eloquent tongue, and in whose veins flowed the same blood as his  own, was moved with pity and pardoned him. Ali got off with a mild  captivity in the palace of his powerful relative, who heaped benefits  upon him, and did all he could to lead him into the paths of probity. He  appeared amenable to these good influences, and bitterly to repent his  past errors. After some years, believing in his reformation, and moved  by the prayers of Kamco, who incessantly implored the restitution of her  dear son, the generous pacha restored him his liberty, only giving him  to under stand that he had no more mercy to expect if he again disturbed  the public peace. Ali taking the threat seriously; did not run the risk  of braving it, and, on the contrary, did all he could to conciliate the  man whose anger he dared not kindle. Not only did he keep the promise he  had made to live quietly, but by his good conduct he caused his, former  escapades to be forgotten, putting under obligation all his neighbours,  and attaching to himself, through the services he rendered them, a great  number of friendly disposed persons. In this manner he soon assumed a  distinguished and honourable rank among the beys of the country, and  being of marriageable age, he sought and formed an alliance with the  daughter of Capelan Tigre, Pacha of Delvino, who resided at  Argyro-Castron. This union, happy on both sides, gave him, with one of  the most accomplished women in Epirus, a high position and great  influence.    It seemed as if this marriage were destined to wean Ali forever from his  former turbulent habits and wild adventures. But the family into which  he had married afforded violent contrasts and equal elements of good and  mischief. If Emineh, his wife, was a model of virtue, his father-in-law,  Capelan, was a composition of every vice--selfish, ambitious, turbulent,  fierce. Confident in his courage, and further emboldened by his  remoteness from the capital, the Pacha of Delvino gloried in setting law  and authority at defiance.    Ali's disposition was too much like that of his father-in-law to prevent  him from taking his measure very quickly. He soon got on good terms with  him, and entered into his schemes, waiting for an opportunity to  denounce him and become his successor. For this opportunity he had not  long to wait.    Capelan's object in giving his daughter to Tepeleni was to enlist him  among the beys of the province to gain independence, the ruling passion  of viziers. The cunning young man pretended to enter into the views of  his father-in-law, and did all he could to urge him into the path of  rebellion.    An adventurer named Stephano Piccolo, an emissary of Russia, had just  raised in Albania the standard of the Cross and called to arms all the  Christians of the Acroceraunian Mountains. The Divan sent orders to all  the pachas of Northern Turkey in Europe to instantly march against the  insurgents and quell the rising in blood.    Instead of obeying the orders of the Divan and joining Kurd Pacha, who  had summoned him, Capelan, at the instigation of his son-in-law, did all  he could to embarrass the movement of the imperial troops, and without  openly making common cause with the insurgents, he rendered them  substantial aid in their resistance. They were, notwithstanding,  conquered and dispersed; and their chief, Stephano Piccolo, had to take  refuge in the unexplored caves of Montenegro.    When the struggle was over, Capelan, as Ali had foreseen, was summoned  to give an account of his conduct before the roumeli-valicy, supreme  judge over Turkey in Europe. He was not only accused of the gravest  offences, but proofs of them were forwarded to the Divan by the very man  who had instigated them. There could be no doubt as to the result of the  inquiry; therefore, the pacha, who had no suspicions of his son-in-law's  duplicity, determined not to leave his pachalik. That was not in  accordance with the plans of Ali, who wished to succeed to both the  government and the wealth of his father-in-law. He accordingly made the  most plausible remonstrances against the inefficacy and danger of such a  resistance. To refuse to plead was tantamount to a confession of guilt,  and was certain to bring on his head a storm against which he was  powerless to cope, whilst if he obeyed the orders of the roumeli-valicy  he would find it easy to excuse himself. To give more effect to his  perfidious advice, Ali further employed the innocent Emineh, who was  easily alarmed on her father's account. Overcome by the reasoning of his  son-in-law and the tears of his daughter, the unfortunate pacha  consented to go to Monastir, where he had been summoned to appear, and  where he was immediately arrested and beheaded.    Ali's schemes had succeeded, but both his ambition and his cupidity were  frustrated. Ali, Bey of Argyro-Castron, who had throughout shown himself  devoted to the sultan, was nominated Pacha of Delvino in place of  Capelan. He sequestered all the property of his predecessor, as  confiscated to the sultan, and thus deprived Ali Tepeleni of all the  fruits of his crime.    This disappointment kindled the wrath of the ambitious Ali. He swore  vengeance for the spoliation of which he considered himself the victim.  But the moment was not favourable for putting his projects in train. The  murder of Capelan, which its perpetrator intended for a mere crime,  proved a huge blunder. The numerous enemies of Tepeleni, silent under  the administration of the late pacha, whose resentment they had cause to  fear, soon made common cause under the new one, for whose support they  had hopes. Ali saw the danger, sought and found the means to obviate it.  He succeeded in making a match between Ali of Argyro-Castron, who was  unmarried, and Chainitza, his own sister. This alliance secured to him  the government of Tigre, which he held under Capelan. But that was not  sufficient. He must put himself in a state of security against the  dangers he had lately, experienced, and establish himself on a firm  footing' against possible accidents. He soon formed a plan, which he  himself described to the French Consul in the following words:--    \"Years were elapsing,\" said he, \"and brought no important change in my  position. I was an important partisan, it is true, and strongly  supported, but I held no title or Government employment of my own. I  recognised the necessity of establishing myself firmly in my birthplace.  I had devoted friends, and formidable foes, bent on my destruction, whom  I must put out of the way, for my own safety. I set about a plan for  destroying them at one blow, and ended by devising one with which I  ought to have commenced my career. Had I done so, I should have saved  much time and pains.    \"I was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#3)"],[1,"slightest, if he has taken the road to the Bourbonnais; for I  believe there are in that province noblemen belonging to his family who  will not allow him to be rearrested.\"    The fugitive was, indeed, no other than the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,  accused of all the enormous crimes detailed by the provost, who by his  audacious flight opened for himself an active part in the strange story  which it remains to relate.    It came to pass, a fortnight after these events, that a mounted  gentleman rang at the wicket gate of the chateau de Saint-Geran, at the  gates of Moulins. It was late, and the servants were in no hurry to  open. The stranger again pulled the bell in a masterful manner, and at  length perceived a man running from the bottom of the avenue. The  servant peered through the wicket, and making out in the twilight a very  ill-appointed traveller, with a crushed hat, dusty clothes, and no  sword, asked him what he wanted, receiving a blunt reply that the  stranger wished to see the Count de Saint-Geran without any further loss  of time. The servant replied that this was impossible; the other got  into a passion.    \"Who are you?\" asked the man in livery.    \"You are a very ceremonious fellow!\" cried the horseman. \"Go and tell M.  de Saint-Geran that his relative, the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, wishes  to see him at once.\"    The servant made humble apologies, and opened the wicket gate. He then  walked before the marquis, called other servants, who came to help him  to dismount, and ran to give his name in the count's apartments. The  latter was about to sit down to supper when his relative was announced;  he immediately went to receive the marquis, embraced him again and  again, and gave him the most friendly and gracious reception possible.  He wished then to take him into the dining-room to present him to all  the family; but the marquis called his attention to the disorder of his  dress, and begged for a few minutes' conversation. The count took him  into his dressing-room, and had him dressed from head to foot in his own  clothes, whilst they talked. The marquis then narrated a made-up story  to M. de Saint-Geran relative to the accusation brought against him.  This greatly impressed his relative, and gave him a secure footing in  the chateau. When he had finished dressing, he followed the count, who  presented him to the countess and the rest of the family.    It will now be in place to state who the inmates of the chateau were,  and to relate some previous occurrences to explain subsequent ones.    The Marshal de Saint-Geran, of the illustrious house of Guiche, and  governor of the Bourbonnais, had married, for his first wife, Anne de  Tournon, by whom he had one son, Claude de la Guiche, and one daughter,  who married the Marquis de Bouille. His wife dying, he married again  with Suzanne des Epaules, who had also been previously married, being  the widow of the Count de Longaunay, by whom she had Suzanne de  Longaunay.    The marshal and his wife, Suzanne des Epauies, for the mutual benefit of  their children by first nuptials, determined to marry them, thus sealing  their own union with a double tie. Claude de Guiche, the marshal's son,  married Suzanne de Longaunay.    This alliance was much to the distaste of the Marchioness de Bouille,  the marshal's daughter, who found herself separated from her stepmother,  and married to a man who, it was said, gave her great cause for  complaint, the greatest being his threescore years and ten.    The contract of marriage between Claude de la Guiche and Suzanne de  Longaunay was executed at Rouen on the 17th of February 1619; but the  tender age of the bridegroom, who was then but eighteen, was the cause  of his taking a tour in Italy, whence he returned after two years. The  marriage was a very happy one but for one circumstance--it produced no  issue. The countess could not endure a barrenness which threatened the  end of a great name, the extinction of a noble race. She made vows,  pilgrimages; she consulted doctors and quacks; but to no purpose.    The Marshal de Saint-Geran died on the Loth of December 1632, having the  mortification of having seen no descending issue from the marriage of  his son. The latter, now Count de Saint-Geran, succeeded his father in  the government of the Bourbonnais, and was named Chevalier of the King's  Orders.    Meanwhile the Marchioness de Bouille quarrelled with her old husband the  marquis, separated from him after a scandalous divorce, and came to live  at the chateau of Saint-Geran, quite at ease as to her brother's  marriage, seeing that in default of heirs all his property would revert  to her.    Such was the state of affairs when the Marquis de Saint-Maixent arrived  at the chateau. He was young, handsome, very cunning, and very  successful with women; he even made a conquest of the dowager Countess  de Saint-Geran, who lived there with her children. He soon plainly saw  that he might easily enter into the most intimate relations with the  Marchioness de Bouille.    The Marquis de Saint-Maixent's own fortune was much impaired by his  extravagance and by the exactions of the law, or rather, in plain words,  he had lost it all. The marchioness was heiress presumptive to the  count: he calculated that she would soon lose her own husband; in any  case, the life of a septuagenarian did not much trouble a man like the  marquis; he could then prevail upon the marchioness to marry him, thus  giving him the command of the finest fortune in the province.    He set to work to pay his court to her, especially avoiding anything  that could excite the slightest suspicion. It was, however, difficult to  get on good terms with the marchioness without showing outsiders what  was going on. But the marchioness, already prepossessed by the agreeable  exterior of M. de Saint-Maixent, soon fell into his toils, and the  unhappiness of her marriage, with the annoyances incidental to a  scandalous case in the courts, left her powerless to resist his schemes.  Nevertheless, they had but few opportunities of seeing one' another  alone: the countess innocently took a part in all their conversations;  the count often came to take the marquis out hunting; the days passed in  family pursuits. M. de Saint-Maixent had not so far had an opportunity  of saying what a discreet woman ought to pretend not to hear; this  intrigue, notwithstanding the marquis's impatience, dragged terribly.    The countess, as has been stated, had for twenty years never ceased to  hope that her prayers would procure for her the grace of bearing a son  to her husband. Out of sheer weariness she had given herself up to all  kinds of charlatans, who at that period were well received by people of  rank. On one occasion she brought from Italy a sort of astrologer, who  as nearly as possible poisoned her with a horrible nostrum, and was sent  back to his own country in a hurry, thanking his stars for having  escaped so cheaply. This procured Madame de Saint-Geran a severe  reprimand from her confessor; and, as time went on, she gradually  accustomed herself to the painful conclusion that she would die  childless, and cast herself into the arms of religion. The count, whose  tenderness for her never failed, yet clung to the hope of an heir, and  made his Will with this in view. The marchioness's hopes had become  certainties, and M. de Saint-Maixent, perfectly tranquil on this head,  thought only of forwarding his suit with Madame-de Bouille, when, at the  end of the month of November 1640, the Count de Saint-Geran was obliged  to repair to Paris in great haste on pressing duty.    The countess, who could not bear to be separated from her husband, took  the family advice as to accompanying him. The marquis, delighted at an  opportunity which left him almost alone in the chateau with Madame de  Bouille, painted the journey to Paris in the most attractive colours,  and said all he could to decide her to go. The marchioness, for her  part, worked very quietly to the same end; it was more than was needed.  It was settled that the countess should go with M. de Saint-Geran. She  soon made her preparations, and a few days later they set off on the  journey together.    The marquis had no fears about declaring his passion; the conquest of  Madame de Bouille gave him no trouble; he affected the most violent  love, and she responded in the same terms. All their time was spent in  excursions and walks from, which the servants were excluded; the lovers,  always together, passed whole days in some retired part of the park, or  shut up in their apartments. It was impossible for these circumstances  not to cause gossip among an army of servants, against whom they had to  keep incessantly on their guard; and this naturally happened.    The marchioness soon found herself obliged to make confidantes of the  sisters Quinet, her maids; she had no difficulty in gaining their  support, for the girls were greatly attached to her. This was the first  step of shame for Madame de Bouille, and the first step of corruption  for herself and her paramour, who soon found themselves entangled in the  blackest of plots. Moreover, there was at the chateau de Saint-Geran a  tall, spare, yellow, stupid man, just intelligent enough to perform, if  not to conceive, a bad action, who was placed in authority over the  domestics; he was a common peasant whom the old marshal had deigned to  notice, and whom the count had by degrees promoted to the service of  major-domo on account of his long service in the house, and because he  had seen him there since he himself was a child; he would not take him  away as body servant, fearing that his notions of service would not do  for Paris, and left him to the superintendence of the household. The  marquis had a quiet talk with this man, took his measure, warped his  mind as he wished, gave him some money, and acquired him body and soul.  These different agents"]]]
