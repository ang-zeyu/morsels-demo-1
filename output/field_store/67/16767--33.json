A little work will ease up your head, an' you kin tell us all  abaout your dad an' your ma n' your money efterwards.\"    \"She's on the steamer,\" said Harvey, his eyes fill-with tears. \"Take me  to New York at once.\"    \"Poor woman--poor woman! When she has you back she'll forgit it all,  though. There's eight of us on the \"We're Here\", an' ef we went back  naow--it's more'n a thousand mile--we'd lose the season. The men they  wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable.\"    \"But my father would make it all right.\"    \"He'd try. I don't doubt he'd try,\" said Troop; \"but a whole season's  catch is eight men's bread; an' you'll be better in your health when  you see him in the fall. Go forward an' help Dan. It's ten an' a ha'af  a month, ez I said, an', o' course, all f'und, same ez the rest o' us.\"    \"Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?\" said Harvey.    \"An' other things. You've no call to shout, young feller.\"    \"I won't! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little  fish-kettle\"--Harvey stamped on the deck--\"ten times over, if you take  me to New York safe; and--and--you're in a hundred and thirty by me,  anyway.\"    \"Ha-ow?\" said Troop, the iron face darkening.    \"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do  menial work\"--Harvey was very proud of that adjective--\"till the Fall.  I tell you I will not. You hear?\"    Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while,  as Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.    \"Hsh!\" he said at last. \"I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own  mind. It's a matter o' jedgment.\"    Dan Stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. \"Don't go to tamperin'  with dad any more,\" he pleaded. \"You've called him a thief two or three  times over, an' he don't take that from any livin' bein'.\"    \"I won't!\" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice; and still  Troop meditated.    \"Seems kinder unneighbourly,\" he said at last, his eye travelling down  to Harvey. \"I don't blame you, not a mite, young feller, nor you won't  blame me when the bile's out o' your systim. 'Be sure you sense what I  say? Ten an' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner--an' all f'und--fer  to teach you an' fer the sake o' your health. Yes or no?\"    \"No!\" said Harvey. \"Take me back to New York or I'll see you--\"    He did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the  scuppers, holding on to a nose that bled, while Troop looked down on  him serenely.    \"Dan,\" he said to his son, \"I was sot ag'in' this young feller when I  first saw him, on account o' hasty jedgments. Never you be led astray  by hasty jedgments, Dan. Naow I'm sorry for him, because he's clear  distracted in his upper works. He ain't responsible fer the names he's  give me, nor fer his other statements nor fer jumpin' overboard, which  I'm abaout ha'af convinced he did. You be gentle with him, Dan, 'r I'll  give you twice what I've give him. Them hemmeridges clears the head.  Let him sluice it off!\"    Troop went down solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men  bunked, leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.        CHAPTER II    \"I warned ye,\" said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark,  oiled planking. \"Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw!  there's no sense takin' on so.\" Harvey's shoulders were rising and  falling in spasms of dry sobbing. \"I know the feelin'. First time dad  laid me out was the last--and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel  sickish an' lonesome. I know.\"    \"It does,\" moaned Harvey. \"That man's either crazy or drunk, and--and I  can't do anything.\"    \"Don't say that to dad,\" whispered Dan. \"He's set ag'in' all liquor,  an'--well, he told me you was the madman. What in creation made you  call him a thief? He's my dad.\"    Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad  of bills. \"I'm not crazy,\" he wound up. \"Only--your father has never  seen more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and my father could buy up  this boat once a week and never miss it.\"    \"You don't know what the \"We're Here's\" worth. Your dad must hey a pile  o' money. How did he git it? Dad sez loonies can't shake out a straight  yarn. Go ahead.\"    \"In gold-mines and things, West.\"    \"I've read o' that kind o' business. Out West, too? Does he go around  with a pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the circus? They call that the  Wild West, and I've heard that their spurs an' bridles was solid  silver.\"    \"You are a chump!\" said Harvey, amused in spite of himself. \"My father  hasn't any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he takes his car.\"    \"Haow? Lobster-car?\"    \"No. His own private car, of course. You've seen a private car some  time in your life?\"    \"Slatin Beeman he hez one,\" said Dan, cautiously. \"I saw her at the  Union Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin' her run.\" (Dan meant  cleaning the windows.) \"But Slatin Beeman he owns 'baout every railroad  on Long Island, they say; an' they say he's bought 'baout ha'af Noo  Hampshire an' run a line-fence around her, an' filled her up with lions  an' tigers an' bears an' buffalo an' crocodiles an' such all. Slatin  Beeman he's a millionaire. I've seen his car. Yes?\"    \"Well, my father's what they call a multi-millionaire; and he has two  private cars. One's named for me, the 'Harvey,' and one for my mother,  the 'Constance.'\"    \"Hold on,\" said Dan. \"Dad don't ever let me swear, but I guess you can.  'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope you may die if you're lying.\"    \"Of course,\" said Harvey.    \"Thet ain't 'nuff. Say, 'Hope I may die if I ain't speakin' truth.'\"    \"Hope I may die right here,\" said Harvey, \"if every word I've spoken  isn't the cold truth.\"    \"Hundred an' thirty-four dollars an' all?\" said Dan. \"I heard ye  talkin' to dad, an' I ha'af looked you'd be swallered up, same's Jonah.\"    Harvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person  along his own lines, and ten minutes' questioning convinced him that  Harvey was not lying--much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most  terrible oath known to boyhood, and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended  nose, in the scuppers, recounting marvels upon marvels.    \"Gosh!\" said Dan at last, from the very bottom of his soul, when Harvey  had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin  of mischievous delight overspread his broad face. \"I believe you,  Harvey. Dad's made a mistake fer once in his life.\"    \"He has, sure,\" said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.    \"He'll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his  jedgments.\" Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. \"Oh, Harvey, don't you  spile the catch by lettin' on.\"    \"I don't want to be knocked down again. I'll get even with him, though.\"    \"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he'd knock ye down  again sure. The more he was mistook the more he'd do it. But gold-mines  and pistols--\"    \"I never said a word about pistols,\" Harvey cut in, for he was on his  oath.    \"Thet's so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you  an' one fer her; an' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all  knocked into the scuppers fer not workin' fer ten an' a ha'af a month!  It's the top haul o' the season.\" He exploded with noiseless chuckles.    \"Then I was right? \"said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.    \"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o' wrong! You take right hold an'  pitch in 'longside o' me, or you'll catch it, an' I'll catch it fer  backin' you up. Dad always gives me double helps 'cause I'm his son,  an' he hates favourin' folk. 'Guess you're kinder mad at dad. I've been  that way time an' again. But dad's a mighty jest man; all the fleet  says so.\"    \"Looks like justice, this, don't it?\" Harvey pointed to his outraged  nose.    \"Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer  health. Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or  dad or any one on the \"We're Here's\" a thief.  We ain't any common  wharf-end crowd by any manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've  shipped together for six years an' more. Don't you make any mistake on  that! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He calls 'em vain oaths, and  pounds me; but ef I could say what you said 'baout your pap an' his  fixin's, I'd say that 'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in your  pockets when I dried your kit, fer I didn't look to see; but I'd say,  using the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad--an'  we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard--knows  anythin' 'baout the money. Thet's my say. Naow?\"    The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the  loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. \"That's all right,\"  he said. Then he looked down confusedly. \"'Seems to me that for a  fellow just saved from drowning I haven't been over and above grateful,  Dan.\"    \"Well, you was shook up and silly,\" said Dan. \"Anyway, there was only  dad an' me aboard to see it. The cook he don't count.\"    \"I might have thought about losing the bills that way,\" Harvey said,  half to himself, \"instead of calling everybody in sight a thief Where's  your father?\"    \"In the cabin What d' you want o' him again?\"    \"You'll see,\" said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his  head was still singing, to the cabin steps, where the little  ship's clock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the  chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an  enormous black pencil, which he sucked hard from time to time.    \"I haven't acted quite right,\" said Harvey, surprised at his own  meekness.    \"What's wrong"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#3)"],[1,"will take in Bulgaria is the fact that it was the arena in  which were fought the great battles of races declaring the doom of the  Roman Empire. Fortunately, from old Gothic chronicles it is possible  to get pictures--valuable for vivid colouring rather than strict  accuracy--which bring very close to us that curious tragedy of  civilisation, the destruction of the power of Rome and the overrunning  of Europe by successive waves of barbarians.    In the fifth century before Christ, what is now Bulgaria was practically  a Greek colony, and its trading relations with the North gave possibly  the first hint to the Goths of the easiest path by which to invade the  Roman Empire. The present Bulgarian towns of Varna (on the Black Sea)  and Kustendji (which has a literary history in that it was later a place  of banishment for Ovid the poet) can be traced back as Greek trading  towns through which passed traffic from the Mediterranean to the  \"Scythians,\" _i.e._ the Goths of the North. Amber and furs came from the  north of the river valleys, and caravans from the south brought in  return silver and gold and bronze.    Towards the dawn of the Christian era there began a swelling-over of the  Goths from the Baltic shores, sending one wave of invasion down towards  Italy, another towards the Black Sea and the Aegean. Jordanes, the  earliest Gothic historian, writing in the sixth century gives this  account--derived from Gothic folk-songs--of the movement of the invasion  towards the Balkan Peninsula (probably about A.D. 170):        In the reign of the fifth King after Berig, Filimer, son of      Gadariges, the people had so greatly increased in numbers that      they all agreed in the conclusion that the army of the Goths      should move forward with their families in quest of more fitting      abodes. Thus they came to those regions of Scythia which in      their tongue are called Oium, whose great fertility pleased them      much. But there was a bridge there by which the army essayed      to cross a river, and when half of the army had passed, that      bridge fell down in irreparable ruin, nor could any one either      go forward or return. For that place is said to be girt round      with a whirlpool, shut in with quivering morasses, and thus by      her confusion of the two elements, land and water, Nature has      rendered it inaccessible. But in truth, even to this day, if you      may trust the evidence of passers-by, though they go not nigh      the place, the far-off voices of cattle may be heard and traces      of men may be discerned.        That part of the Goths therefore which under the leadership of      Filimer crossed the river and reached the lands of Oium,      obtained the longed-for soil. Then without delay they came to      the nation of the Spali, with whom they engaged in battle and      therein gained the victory. Thence they came forth as      conquerors, and hastened to the farthest part of Scythia which      borders on the Black Sea.    [Illustration: A PEASANT AT WORK, DISTRICT OF TSARIBROD]    The people whom these Teutonic Goths displaced were Slavs. The Goths  settled down first on the Black Sea between the mouths of the Danube and  of the Dniester and beyond that river almost to the Don, becoming thus  neighbours of the Huns on the east, of the Roman Empire's Balkan  colonies on the west, and of the Slavs on the north. It is reasonable to  suppose that to some extent they mingled their blood somewhat with the  Slavs whom they dispossessed, and that they came into some contact with  the Huns also. It was in the third century of the Christian era that  these Goths, who had been for some time subsidised by the Roman emperors  on the condition that they kept the peace, crossed the Danube and  devastated Moesia and Thrace. An incident of this invasion was the  successful resistance of the garrison of Marcianople--now Schumla--to  the invaders. In a following campaign the Goths crossed the Danube at  Novae (now Novo-grad) and besieged Philippopolis, a city which still  keeps its name and now, as then, is an important strategical point  commanding the Thracian Plain. (It was Philippopolis which would have  been the objective of the Turkish attack upon Bulgaria in 1912-1913 if  Turkey had been given a chance in that war to develop a forward  movement.) This city was taken by the Goths, and the first notable  Balkan massacre is recorded, over 100,000 people being put to the sword  within its walls. Later in the campaign the Emperor Decius was defeated  and killed by the Goths in a battle waged on marshy ground near the  mouth of the Danube. This was the second of the three great disasters  which marked the doom of the Roman Empire: the first was the defeat of  Varus in Germany; the third was to be the defeat and death of the  Emperor Valens before Adrianople. Bulgaria, the scene of the second and  third disasters, can accurately be described as having provided the  death-arena for Rome.    [Illustration: WOMEN OF PORDIM, IN THE PLEVNA DISTRICT]    From the defeat of Decius (A.D. 251) may be said to date the Gothic  colonisation of the Balkan Peninsula. True, after that event the Goths  often retired behind the Danube for a time, but, as a rule, thereafter  they were steadily encroaching on the Roman territory, carrying on a  maritime war in the Black Sea as well as land forays across the Danube.  It was because of the successes of the Goths in the Balkans that the  decision was ultimately arrived at to move the capital of the Roman  Empire from Rome to Constantinople. During the first Gothic attack,  after the death of Decius, Byzantium itself was threatened, and the  cities around the Sea of Marmora sacked. An incident of this invasion  which has been chronicled is that the Goths enjoyed hugely the warm  baths they found at Anchialus--\"there were certain warm springs renowned  above all others in the world for their healing virtues, and greatly did  the Goths delight to wash therein. And having tarried there many days  they thence returned home.\" Now Anchialus is clearly identifiable as  the present Bulgarian town of Bourgas, a flourishing seaport connected  by rail with Jambouli and still noted for its baths.    In a later Gothic campaign (A.D. 262), based on a naval expedition from  the Black Sea, Byzantium was taken, the Temple of Diana at Ephesus  destroyed, and Athens sacked. A German historian pictures this last  incident:        The streets and squares which at other times were enlivened only      by the noisy crowds of the ever-restless citizens, and of the      students who flocked thither from all parts of the Graeco-Roman      world, now resounded with the dull roar of the German bull-horns      and the war-cry of the Goths. Instead of the red cloak of the      Sophists, and the dark hoods of the Philosophers, the skin-coats      of the barbarians fluttered in the breeze. Wodan and Donar had      gotten the victory over Zeus and Athene.    It was in regard to this capture of Athens that the story was first  told--it has been told of half a dozen different sackings since--that a  band of Goths came upon a library and were making a bonfire of its  contents when one of their leaders interposed:        \"Not so, my sons; leave these scrolls untouched, that the Greeks      may in time to come, as they have in time past, waste their      manhood in poring over their wearisome contents. So will they      ever fall, as now, an easy prey to the strong unlearned sons of      the North.\"    In the ultimate result the Goths were driven out of Athens by a small  force led by Dexippus, a soldier and a scholar whose exploit revived  memory of the deeds of Greece in her greatness. The capture of Athens  deeply stirred the civilised world of the day, and \"Goth\" still survives  as a term of destructive barbarism.    A few years later (A.D. 269) the Goths began a systematic invasion of  the Balkan provinces of the Roman Empire, attacking the Roman territory  both by sea and by land. The tide of victory sometimes turned for a  while, and at Naissus (now Nish in Servia, near the border of Bulgaria)  the Goths were defeated by the Emperor Claudius. Their defeated army was  then shut up in the Balkan Mountains for a winter, and the Gothic power  in the Balkans temporarily crushed. The Emperor Claudius, who took the  surname Gothicus in celebration of his victory, announced it  grandiloquently to the governor of Illyricum:        _Claudius to Brocchus._        We have destroyed 320,000 of the Goths; we have sunk 2000 of      their ships. The rivers are bridged over with shields; with      swords and lances all the shores are covered. The fields are      hidden from sight under the superincumbent bones; no road is      free from them; an immense encampment of waggons is deserted. We      have taken such a number of women that each soldier can have two      or three concubines allotted to him.    [Illustration: IN THE HARVEST FIELDS NEAR SOFIA]    But the succeeding Emperor, Aurelian, gave up all Dacia to the Goths and  withdrew the Romanised Dacians into the province of Moesia--made up of  what is now Eastern Servia and Western Bulgaria. This province was  divided into two and renamed Dacia. One part, Dacia Mediterranea, had  for its capital Sardica, now Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Then  followed a period of comparative peace. The Roman emperors saw that on  the Balkan frontier their Empire had to be won or lost, and strengthened  the defences there. Thus Diocletian made his headquarters at Nicomedia.  Finally, Constantine moved the capital altogether to Constantinople.  Goth and Roman at this time showed a disposition to a peaceful  amalgamation, and the Bulgarian population was rapidly becoming a  Romano-Gothic one. Christianity had been introduced, and the Gothic  historian Jordanes tells of a Gothic people living upon the northern  side of the Balkan Mountains:        There were also"]]]
