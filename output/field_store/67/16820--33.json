We don't really know much  about them at all; they're very secretive.\"    \"Aloof,\" he corrected her, \"as befits a ruling race. But always  affable.\"    \"You must warn as many Belphins as you can.\"    \"And if none listens to me?\"    \"Then,\" she said dramatically, \"you must approach The Belphin of  Belphins himself.\"    \"But no human being has ever come near him!\" he said plaintively. \"You  know that all those who have tried perished. And that can't be a rumor,  because your grandfather said----\"    \"But they came to _attack_ The Belphin. You're coming to _warn_ him!  That makes a big difference. Ludovick....\" She took his hands in hers;  in the darkness, the jewel swung madly on her presumably heaving bosom.  \"This is bigger than both of us. It's for Earth.\"    He knew it was his patriotic duty to do as she said; still, he had  enjoyed life so much. \"Corisande, wouldn't it be much simpler if we  just destroyed your uncle's secret weapon?\"    \"He'd only make another. Don't you see, Ludovick, this is our only  chance to save the Belphins, to save humanity.... But, of course, I  don't have the right to send you. I'll go myself.\"    \"No, Corisande,\" he sighed. \"I can't let you go. I'll do it.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    Next morning, he set out to warn Belphins. He knew it wasn't much use,  but it was all he could do. The first half dozen responded in much the  same way the Belphin he had warned the previous day had done, by  courteously acknowledging his solicitude and assuring him there was no  need for alarm; they knew all about the Flockharts and everything would  be all right.    After that, they started to get increasingly huffy--which would, he  thought, substantiate the theory that they were all part of one vast  coordinate network of identity. Especially since each Belphin behaved  as if Ludovick had been repeatedly annoying _him_.    Finally, they refused to get off the walks when he hailed them--which  was unheard of, for no Belphin had ever before failed to respond to an  Earthman's call--and when he started running along the walks after  them, they ran much faster than he could.    At last he gave up and wandered about the city for hours, speaking to  neither human nor Belphin, wondering what to do. That is, he knew what  he had to do; he was wondering _how_ to do it. He would never be able  to reach The Belphin of Belphins. No human being had ever done it.  Mieczyslaw and George had died trying to reach him (or it). Even though  their intentions had been hostile and Ludovick's would be helpful,  there was little chance he would be allowed to reach The Belphin with  all the other Belphins against him. What guarantee was there that The  Belphin would not be against him, too?    And yet he knew that he would have to risk his life; there was no help  for it. He had never wanted to be a hero, and here he had heroism  thrust upon him. He knew he could not succeed; equally well, he knew he  could not turn back, for his Belphin teacher had instructed him in the  meaning of duty.    It was twilight when he approached the Blue Tower. Commending himself  to the Infinite Virtue, he entered. The Belphin at the reception desk  did not give off the customary smiling expression. In fact, he seemed  to radiate a curiously apprehensive aura.    \"Go back, young man,\" he said. \"You're not wanted here.\"    \"I must see The Belphin of Belphins. I must warn him against the  Flockharts.\"    \"He has been warned,\" the receptionist told him. \"Go home and be  happy!\"    \"I don't trust you or your brothers. I must see The Belphin himself.\"    Suddenly this particular Belphin lost his commanding manners. He began  to wilt, insofar as so rigidly constructed a creature could go limp.  \"Please, we've done so much for you. Do this for us.\"    \"The Belphin of Belphins did things for us,\" Ludovick countered. \"You  are all only his followers. How do I know you are _really_ following  him? How do I know you haven't turned against him?\"    Without giving the creature a chance to answer, he strode forward.  The Belphin attempted to bar his way. Ludovick knew one Belphin was  a myriad times as strong as a human, so it was out of utter futility  that he struck.    The Belphin collapsed completely, flying apart in a welter of fragile  springs and gears. The fact was of some deeper significance, Ludovick  knew, but he was too numbed by his incredible success to be able to  think clearly. All he knew was that The Belphin would be able to  explain things to him.                         *      *      *      *      *    Bells began to clash and clang. That meant the force barriers had gone  up. He could see the shimmering insubstance of the first one before  him. Squaring his shoulders, he charged it ... and walked right through.  He looked himself up and down. He was alive and entire.    Then the whole thing was a fraud; the barriers were not lethal--or  perhaps even actual. But what of Mieczyslaw? And George? And countless  rumored others? He would not let himself even try to think of them. He  would not let himself even try to think of anything save his duty.    A staircase spiraled up ahead of him. A Belphin was at its foot. Behind  him, a barrier iridesced.    \"Please, young man----\" the Belphin began. \"You don't understand. Let  me explain.\"    But Ludovick destroyed the thing before it could say anything further,  and he passed right through the barrier. He had to get to the top and  warn The Belphin of Belphins, whoever or whatever he (or it) was, that  the Flockharts had a secret weapon which might be able to annihilate it  (or him). Belphin after Belphin Ludovick destroyed, and barrier after  barrier he penetrated until he reached the top. At the head of the  stairs was a vast golden door.    \"Go no further, Ludovick Eversole!\" a mighty voice roared from within.  \"To open that door is to bring disaster upon your race.\"    But all Ludovick knew was that he had to get to The Belphin within and  warn him. He battered down the door; that is, he would have battered  down the door if it had not turned out to be unlocked. A stream of  noxious vapor rushed out of the opening, causing him to black out.    When he came to, most of the vapor had dissipated. The Belphin of  Belphins was already dying of asphyxiation, since it was, in fact, a  single alien entity who breathed another combination of elements. The  room at the head of the stairs had been its tank.    \"You fool....\" it gasped. \"Through your muddle-headed integrity ... you  have destroyed not only me ... but Earth's future. I tried to make ...  this planet a better place for humanity ... and this is my reward....\"    \"But I don't understand!\" Ludovick wept. \"_Why_ did you let me do it?  Why were Mieczyslaw and George and all the others killed? Why was it  that I could pass the barriers and they could not?\"    \"The barriers were triggered ... to respond to hostility.... You meant  well ... so our defenses ... could not work.\" Ludovick had to bend low  to hear the creature's last words: \"There is ... Earth proverb ...  should have warned me ... 'I can protect myself ... against my enemies  ... but who will protect me ... from my friends'...?\"    The Belphin of Belphins died in Ludovick's arms. He was the last of his  race, so far as Earth was concerned, for no more came. If, as they had  said themselves, some outside power had sent them to take care of the  human race, then that power had given up the race as a bad job. If they  were merely exploiting Earth, as the malcontents had kept suggesting,  apparently it had proven too dangerous or too costly a venture.                         *      *      *      *      *    Shortly after The Belphin's demise, the Flockharts arrived en masse.  \"We won't need your secret weapons now,\" Ludovick told them dully. \"The  Belphin of Belphins is dead.\"    Corisande gave one of the rippling laughs he was to grow to hate so  much. \"Darling, _you_ were my secret weapon all along!\" She beamed at  her \"relatives,\" and it was then he noticed the faint lines of her  forehead. \"I told you I could use the power of love to destroy the  Belphins!\" And then she added gently: \"I think there is no doubt who  is head of 'this family' now.\"    The uncle gave a strained laugh. \"You're going to have a great little  first lady there, boy,\" he said to Ludovick.    \"First lady?\" Ludovick repeated, still absorbed in his grief.    \"Yes, I imagine the people will want to make you our first President by  popular acclaim.\"    Ludovick looked at him through a haze of tears. \"But I killed The  Belphin. I didn't mean to, but ... they must hate me!\"    \"Nonsense, my boy; they'll adore you. You'll be a hero!\"    Events proved him right. Even those people who had lived in apparent  content under the Belphins, accepting what they were given and  seemingly enjoying their carefree lives, now declared themselves to  have been suffering in silent resentment all along. They hurled flowers  and adulatory speeches at Ludovick and composed extremely flattering  songs about him.    Shortly after he was universally acclaimed President, he married  Corisande. He couldn't escape.    \"Why doesn't she become President herself?\" he wailed, when the relatives  came and found him hiding in the ruins of the Blue Tower. The people had  torn the Tower down as soon as they were sure The Belphin was dead and  the others thereby rendered inoperant. \"It would spare her a lot of  bother.\"    \"Because she is not The Belphin-slayer,\" the uncle said, dragging him  out. \"Besides, she loves you. Come on, Ludovick, be a man.\" So they  hauled him off to the wedding and, amid much feasting, he was married  to Corisande.                         *      *      *      *      *    He never drew another happy breath. In the first place, now that The  Belphin was dead, all the machinery that had been operated by him  stopped and no one knew how to fix it.

When the  short period I mention had elapsed, the hand of the medium was again  seized with its convulsive tremor, and she wrote, under this strange  influence, a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. They were  as follows:    \"I am here. Question me.    \"_Leeuwenhoek_.\"    I was astounded. The name was identical with that I had written beneath  the table, and carefully kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable  that an uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should know even the name  of the great father of microscopies. It may have been biology; but  this theory was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my slip--still  concealing it from Mrs. Vulpes--a series of questions which, to avoid  tediousness, I shall place with the responses, in the order in which  they occurred:    I.--Can the microscope be brought to perfection?    Spirit--Yes.    I.--Am I destined to accomplish this great task?    Spirit.--You are.    I.--I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love which  you bear to science, help me!    Spirit--A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to  electro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a  rearrangement of its atoms _inter se_ and from that stone you will form  the universal lens.    I.--Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens?    Spirit--So great that all that has gone before is as nothing.    I.--But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense that the image  will be formed within the lens. How is that difficulty to be surmounted?    Spirit--Pierce the lens through its axis, and the difficulty is  obviated. The image will be formed in the pierced space, which will  itself serve as a tube to look through. Now I am called. Good-night.    I can not at all describe the effect that these extraordinary  communications had upon me. I felt completely bewildered. No biological  theory could account for the _discovery_ of the lens. The medium might,  by means of biological _rapport_ with my mind, have gone so far as to  read my questions and reply to them coherently. But biology could  not enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the  crystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects and admit of  its being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have  passed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In  my excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a  convert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation  that I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to  the door, hoping that I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went  through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the  lintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped  hurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought  possessing me--how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My  entire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate  to its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I  could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.          IV    There was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague  impulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room  unannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a Carcel  lamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held  in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into  his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion.    \"What!\" I cried, \"poring over the miniature of some fair lady? Well,  don't blush so much; I won't ask to see it.\"    Simon laughed awkwardly enough, but made none of the negative  protestations usual on such occasions. He asked me to take a seat.    \"Simon,\" said I, \"I have just come from Madame Vulpes.\"    This time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and seemed stupefied, as  if a sudden electric shock had smitten him. He babbled some incoherent  words, and went hastily to a small closet where he usually kept his  liquors. Although astonished at his emotion, I was too preoccupied with  my own idea to pay much attention to anything else.    \"You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a devil of a woman,\" I  continued. \"Simon, she told me wonderful things to-night, or rather  was the means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I could only get a  diamond that weighed one hundred and forty carats!\"    Scarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this desire died upon my lips  when Simon, with the aspect of a wild beast, glared at me savagely, and,  rushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign weapons hung on the wall,  caught up a Malay creese, and brandished it furiously before him.    \"No!\" he cried in French, into which he always broke when excited. \"No!  you shall not have it! You are perfidious! You have consulted with that  demon, and desire my treasure! But I will die first! Me, I am brave! You  can not make me fear!\"    All this, uttered in a loud voice, trembling with excitement, astounded  me. I saw at a glance that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of  Simon's secret, whatever it was. It was necessary to reassure him.    \"My dear Simon,\" I said, \"I am entirely at a loss to know what you mean.  I went to Madame Vulpes to consult with her on a scientific problem,  to the solution of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I just  mentioned was necessary. You were never alluded to during the evening,  nor, so far as I was concerned, even thought of. What can be the meaning  of this outburst? If you happen to have a set of valuable diamonds in  your possession, you need fear nothing from me. The diamond which I  require you could not possess; or, if you did possess it, you would not  be living here.\"    Something in my tone must have completely reassured him, for his  expression immediately changed to a sort of constrained merriment,  combined however, with a certain suspicious attention to my movements.  He laughed, and said that I must bear with him; that he was at certain  moments subject to a species of vertigo, which betrayed itself in  incoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off as rapidly as they  came.    He put his weapon aside while making this explanation, and endeavored,  with some success, to assume a more cheerful air.    All this did not impose on me in the least. I was too much accustomed  to analytical labors to be baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to  probe the mystery to the bottom.    \"Simon,\" I said gayly, \"let us forget all this over a bottle of  Burgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's _Clos Vougeot_ downstairs,  fragrant with the odors and ruddy with the sunlight of the Cote d'Or.  Let us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?\"    \"With all my heart,\" answered Simon smilingly.    I produced the wine and we seated ourselves to drink. It was of a famous  vintage, that of 1848, a year when war and wine throve together, and its  pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed vitality to the system.  By the time we had half finished the second bottle, Simon's head, which  I knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I remained calm as  ever, only that every draught seemed to send a flush of vigor through  my limbs. Simon's utterance became more and more indistinct. He took to  singing French _chansons_ of a not very moral tendency. I rose suddenly  from the table just at the conclusion of one of those incoherent verses,  and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet smile, said, \"Simon, I have  deceived you. I learned your secret this evening. You may as well be  frank with me. Mrs. Vulpes--or rather, one of her spirits--told me all.\"    He started with horror. His intoxication seemed for the moment to fade  away, and he made a movement toward the weapon that he had a short time  before laid down, I stopped him with my hand.    \"Monster!\" he cried passionately, \"I am ruined! What shall I do? You  shall never have it! I swear by my mother!\"    \"I don't want it,\" I said; \"rest secure, but be frank with me. Tell me  all about it.\"    The drunkenness began to return. He protested with maudlin earnestness  that I was entirely mistaken--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to  swear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the mystery to me. I  pledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and  hands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from his  breast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered into  a thousand prismatic arrows as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond that  glittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a glance  that this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with  wonder and--must I confess it?--with envy. How could he have obtained  this treasure? In reply to my questions, I could just gather from  his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was  affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged  in diamond-washing in Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a  diamond, but, instead of informing his employers, had quietly watched  the negro until he saw him bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and  fled with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to dispose of  it publicly--so valuable a gem being almost certain to attract too  much attention to its owner's antecedents--and he had not been able  to discover any of those obscure channels by which such matters are  conveyed away safely. He added that, in accordance with oriental  practice, he had named his diamond with the fanciful title of \"The Eye  of Morning.\"    While Simon was relating this to me, I regarded the great diamond  attentively. Never had I beheld"]]]
