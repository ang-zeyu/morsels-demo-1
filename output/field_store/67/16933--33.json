READY TO PLACE FINISHED HOUSES.]          PLACING HOUSES.      The table given on page 16 states the height from the ground that  different species of birds seem to prefer for their nests, to which  several suggestions may be added. The houses should be so located that  cats and other bird enemies do not have easy access to them. The  openings ought to be turned away from the directions from which storms  and winds most often come; and the house must hang or tilt so rain  does not run in at the entrance. Such birds as the woodpeckers spend  most of their time in the trees and so do not take as readily to a  house set on a pole out in the open as martins or bluebirds. Flickers  are seen on the ground a good share of the time in search of their  favorite food, and so will frequently live in houses nailed to fence  posts. Houses are more apt to be occupied if placed in position in  fall or winter before the spring migration, especially houses made of  freshly dressed or newly painted wood. However, such birds as the  robin and bluebird rear more than one brood each season and so a house  set up in May or June may have a tenant. Figs. 40 to 44 show boys of  the University of Wisconsin High School placing some of the houses  they had made.    [Illustration: FIG. 41. (PLACING HOUSES)]    [Illustration: FIG. 42. (PLACING HOUSES)]    [Illustration: FIG. 43. (PLACING HOUSES)]    [Illustration: FIG. 44. (PLACING HOUSES)]          FEEDING SHELVES AND SHELTERS.      Nesting boxes make their appeal to but a part of the birds of any  community. These attract during the early spring and summer months.  Many other species are worth having in our orchards and gardens for  their songs and their activity in destroying insects and weed seeds.  To these some other attraction than nesting boxes must be offered.  Then again, many birds would spend a longer time with us if a certain  food supply were assured them. A simple suet feeder is shown in Fig.  45. The birds cling to the chicken wire while eating. A feeding box  for seed-eating birds is given in Fig. 46. Fig. 47 gives a shelf to be  nailed to the sunny side of a building, while Fig. 48 shows a somewhat  similar type to be fastened to a window sill, making it possible to  observe the birds that come to dine. Birds that hesitate to come close  to buildings may be attracted by the feeders set out in the open. Fig.  50 shows a feeder mounted on an iron pipe so it can be turned in any  direction. This feeder has one end closed by a pane of glass, and is  to be turned so that prevailing winds do not enter. Fig. 49 shows a  feeding shelf for winter use which makes an acceptable robin nesting  shelf in spring. In Fig. 53 is given a feeder mounted on a base with a  vane so the adjustment takes place automatically. Figs. 51 and 52 show  two food shelters considerably more difficult to construct. They have  glass on all sides, and are open at the bottom so that birds can enter  or leave at will. Fig. 30 shows a simple food shelter offering some  protection against rain and snow, while a very attractive group of  shelters are given in Figs. 54, 55, 56 and 57. If you look closely you  may see \"Mabel\" in the right hand feeder in Fig. 54. The builder of  these shelters found her so positive about her rights--since she  discovered the food supply--that he has been obliged to put up the  others to keep peace.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.

A \"JAPANESE\" EFFECT.]    The window-sill lunch counter shown in Figs. 58 and 61 is a most  effective way to study birds at close range. The window selected for  this purpose should be on a quiet and sheltered side of the house if  possible. If trees and shrubbery are near at hand birds are more  likely to be attracted. Branches of thorn apples, alders and  evergreens are fastened firmly to the window frames to dress the lunch  counter on the outside while house plants or at least a curtain  should be placed on the inside as a screen. Fig. 59 shows how  particular varieties of birds may be attracted by offering favorite  foods while Fig. 60 gives an idea of what kindness will do.    [Illustration: FIG. 58. THE BIRD WINDOW SEEN FROM INSIDE THE ROOM.]    [Illustration: FIG. 59. BLUEBIRDS ATTRACTED TO THE WINDOW SILL BY MEAL  WORMS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 60. A ROBIN ABOUT TO EAT FROM THE CHILDREN'S  HANDS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 61. THE WINDOW-SILL LUNCH COUNTER FROM OUTSIDE.]      FOODS.    Food shelters become centers of interest in proportion to the number  of birds attracted to them. The kind of food placed there determines  in time the kind of birds that will be found frequenting them.  Seed-eating birds are readily attracted by the use of small grains  such as oats and wheat. However, every farmer finds a quantity of  weed seeds upon cleaning his seed grain, which proves very acceptable  to chickadees and blue jays. Bread crusts or crumbs, crackers and  doughnuts may be placed in the food shelter with the knowledge that  the birds will eat them. For those of the city who would need to buy  seeds, it will be just as well to get hemp, millet, canary seed and  sunflower seed, together with the small grains and cracked corn for  foods. Suet, scraps of meat and various vegetable scraps, such as  celery, lettuce, apples, raisins, and the berries of various bushes,  if they can be obtained, are relished. Bluebirds seem fond of meal  worms such as develop in old cereals. All birds require water and  frequently suffer because this is not to be had. If it is possible to  meet this need a great service is rendered. Finally, when the ground  is snow covered, many birds appreciate a supply of sand and finely  ground poultry grit. Many birds are lost each winter because of  insufficient food during inclement weather, that if cared for would  remain near neighbors in the summer to wage war upon insect pests.          BIRD BATHS.      The best bird baths have to meet two requirements: (a) clean, fresh  water, and (b) safety from enemies. Almost any shallow dish will meet  both requirements if properly placed and cared for.    [Illustration: FIG. 62. THE PALM GARDEN EXHIBIT OF BIRD BATHS, ETC.,  ST. PAUL, MINN.]    [Illustration: FIG. 63. (CONCRETE BIRD BATH)]    Fig. 62 shows several baths made of concrete. The pedestal and basin  are made of two separate pieces, and are cast in a form or mold. A  more difficult concrete bath is shown in Fig. 63. This project is made  in four pieces. The base consists of two parts, the bottom being cast  in a form made of 1/2\" or 7/8\" stock. The upper part is \"swept up\" by  means of the templet shown, which revolves about an iron rod or a  dowel-rod firmly fastened above, and held below in a hole bored in a  temporary base of wood. The column is cast in a mold made of sheet tin  or galvanized iron run thru tinners' rolls, and held by means of  several wires twisted about it. When this is being cast two pieces of  iron rod are inserted as shown which are to pass into both bowl and  base to make the whole job firm. The bowl may be swept by either of  two methods. The first consists of the making of two templets. With  the first templet a core of clay is swept up of the desired depth and  diameter. Then concrete is placed over this core, which has previously  been treated to a coat of oil. Woven wire is cut into a circular shape  and bent to approximate the curve of the bowl. More concrete is placed  over this, and swept up by means of the second templet. Some  difficulty will be experienced in removing the templet if undercut as  much as shown; however, the mark where it was taken off can easily  be troweled smooth again. The finished pieces are now assembled with a  small quantity of \"neat\" cement in each joint. The second method for  making the bowl begins with the making of templets cut on the opposite  side of the outline, as compared with the first method. A box is then  nailed up and a clay or plaster-of-paris base made. This is oiled, and  the concrete put in place. In this case a wetter mixture than in the  first case should be used. The second templet is then used to strike  off the inside of the bowl. After this has set the pieces may be  assembled as before.          BIRD ENEMIES.      One sometimes wonders that birds manage to exist and to actually  increase in numbers. Possibly the first group of enemies should  include men and boys who kill adult birds, leaving the fledglings to  starve, or who rob "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#3)"],[1,"antipathy to the Aristotelian philosophy began to  display itself. This feeling was strengthened by his earliest inquiries;  and upon his establishment at Pisa he seems to have regarded the  doctrines of Aristotle as the intellectual prey which, in his chace of  glory, he was destined to pursue. Nizzoli, who flourished near the  beginning of the sixteenth century, and Giordano Bruno, who was burned  at Rome in 1600, led the way in this daring pursuit; but it was reserved  for Galileo to track the Thracian boar through its native thickets, and,  at the risk of his own life, to strangle it in its den.    With the resolution of submitting every opinion to the test of  experiment, Galileo's first inquiries at Pisa were directed to the  mechanical doctrines of Aristotle. Their incorrectness and absurdity  soon became apparent; and with a zeal, perhaps, bordering on  indiscretion, he denounced them to his pupils with an ardour of manner  and of expression proportioned to his own conviction of the truth. The  detection of long-established errors is apt to inspire the young  philosopher with an exultation which reason condemns. The feeling of  triumph is apt to clothe itself in the language of asperity; and the  abettor of erroneous opinions is treated as a species of enemy to  science. Like the soldier who fleshes his first spear in battle, the  philosopher is apt to leave the stain of cruelty on his early  achievements. It is only from age and experience, indeed, that we can  expect the discretion of valour, whether it is called forth in  controversy or in battle. Galileo seems to have waged this stern warfare  against the followers of Aristotle; and such was the exasperation which  was excited by his reiterated and successful attacks, that he was  assailed, during the rest of his life, with a degree of rancour which  seldom originates in a mere difference of opinion. Forgetting that all  knowledge is progressive, and that the errors of one generation call  forth the comments, and are replaced by the discoveries, of the next,  Galileo did not anticipate that his own speculations and incompleted  labours might one day provoke unmitigated censure; and he therefore  failed in making allowance for the prejudices and ignorance of his  opponents. He who enjoys the proud lot of taking a position in advance  of his age, need not wonder that his less gifted contemporaries are left  behind. Men are not necessarily obstinate because they cleave to deeply  rooted and venerable errors, nor are they absolutely dull when they are  long in understanding and slow in embracing newly discovered truths.    It was one of the axioms of the Aristotelian mechanics, that the heavier  of two falling bodies would reach the ground sooner than the other, and  that their velocities would be proportional to their weights. Galileo  attacked the arguments by which this opinion was supported; and when he  found his reasoning ineffectual, he appealed to direct experiment. He  maintained, that all bodies would fall through the same height in the  same time, if they were not unequally retarded by the resistance of the  air: and though he performed the experiment with the most satisfactory  results, by letting heavy bodies fall from the leaning tower of Pisa,  yet the Aristotelians, who with their own eyes saw the unequal weights  strike the ground at the same instant, ascribed the effect to some  unknown cause, and preferred the decision of their master to that of  nature herself.    Galileo could not brook this opposition to his discoveries; nor could  the Aristotelians tolerate the rebukes of their young instructor. The  two parties were, consequently, marshalled in hostile array; when,  fortunately for both, an event occurred, which placed them beyond the  reach of danger. Don Giovanni de Medici, a natural son of Cosmo, had  proposed a method of clearing out the harbour of Leghorn. Galileo, whose  opinion was requested, gave such an unfavourable report upon it, that  the disappointed inventor directed against him all the force of his  malice. It was an easy task to concentrate the malignity of his enemies  at Pisa; and so effectually was this accomplished, that Galileo resolved  to accept another professorship, to which he had been previously  invited.    The chair of mathematics in the university of Padua having been vacant  for five years, the republic of Venice had resolved to fill it up; and,  on the recommendation of Guido Ubaldi, Galileo was appointed to it, in  1592, for a period of six years.    Previous to this event, Galileo had lost his father, who died, in 1591,  at an advanced age. As he was the eldest son, the support of the family  naturally devolved upon him; and this sacred obligation must have  increased his anxiety to better his circumstances, and therefore added  to his other inducements to quit Pisa. In September 1592, he removed to  Padua, where he had a salary of only 180 florins, and where he was again  obliged to add to his income by the labours of tuition. Notwithstanding  this fruitless occupation of his time, he appears to have found leisure  for composing several of his works, and completing various inventions,  which will be afterwards described. His manuscripts were circulated  privately among his friends and pupils; but some of them strayed beyond  this sacred limit, and found their way into the hands of persons, who  did not scruple to claim and publish, as their own, the discoveries and  inventions which they contained.    It is not easy to ascertain the exact time when Galileo became a convert  to the doctrines of Copernicus, or the particular circumstances under  which he was led to adopt them. It is stated by Gerard Voss, that a  public lecture of Moestlin, the instructor of Kepler, was the means of  making Galileo acquainted with the true system of the universe. This  assertion, however, is by no means probable; and it has been ably shown,  by the latest biographer of Galileo,[5] that, in his dialogues on the  Copernican system, our author gives the true account of his own  conversion. This passage is so interesting, that we shall give it  entire.         [5] Life of Galileo, in Library of Useful Knowledge, p. 9.    \"I cannot omit this opportunity of relating to you what happened to  myself at the time when this opinion (the Copernican system) began to be  discussed. I was then a very young man, and had scarcely finished my  course of philosophy, which other occupations obliged me to leave off,  when there arrived in this country, from Rostoch, a foreigner, whose  name, I believe, was Christian Vurstisius (Wurteisen), a follower of  Copernicus. This person delivered, on this subject, two or three  lectures in a certain academy, and to a crowded audience. Believing that  several were attracted more by the novelty of the subject than by any  other cause, and being firmly persuaded that this opinion was a piece of  solemn folly, I was unwilling to be present. Upon interrogating,  however, some of those who were there, I found that they all made it a  subject of merriment, with the exception of one, who assured me that it  was not a thing wholly ridiculous. As I considered this individual to be  both prudent and circumspect, I repented that I had not attended the  lectures; and, whenever I met any of the followers of Copernicus, I  began to inquire if they had always been of the same opinion. I found  that there was not one of them who did not declare that he had long  maintained the very opposite opinions, and had not gone over to the new  doctrines till he was driven by the force of argument. I next examined  them one by one, to see if they were masters of the arguments on the  opposite side; and such was the readiness of their answers, that I was  satisfied they had not taken up this opinion from ignorance or vanity.  On the other hand, whenever I interrogated the Peripatetics and the  Ptolemeans--and, out of curiosity, I have interrogated not a  few--respecting their perusal of Copernicus's work, I perceived that  there were few who had seen the book, and not one who understood it. Nor  have I omitted to inquire among the followers of the Peripatetic  doctrines, if any of them had ever stood on the opposite side; and the  result was, that there was not one. Considering, then, that nobody  followed the Copernican doctrine, who had not previously held the  contrary opinion, and who was not well acquainted with the arguments of  Aristotle and Ptolemy; while, on the other hand, nobody followed Ptolemy  and Aristotle, who had before adhered to Copernicus, and had gone over  from him into the camp of Aristotle;--weighing, I say, these things, I  began to believe that, if any one who rejects an opinion which he has  imbibed with his milk, and which has been embraced by an infinite  number, shall take up an opinion held only by a few, condemned by all  the schools, and really regarded as a great paradox, it cannot be  doubted that he must have been induced, not to say driven, to embrace it  by the most cogent arguments. On this account I have become very curious  to penetrate to the very bottom of the subject.\"[6]         [6] Systema Cosmicum, Dial. ii. p. 121.    It appears, on the testimony of Galileo himself, that he taught the  Ptolemaic system, in compliance with the popular feeling, after he had  convinced himself of the truth of the Copernican doctrines. In the  treatise on the sphere, indeed, which bears his name,[7] and which must  have been written soon after he went to Padua, and subsequently to 1592,  the stability of the earth, and the motion of the sun, are supported by  the very arguments which Galileo afterwards ridiculed; but we have no  means of determining whether or not he had then adopted the true system  of the universe. Although he might have taught the Ptolemaic system in  his lectures after he had convinced himself of its falsehood, yet it is  not likely that he would go so far as to publish "]]]
