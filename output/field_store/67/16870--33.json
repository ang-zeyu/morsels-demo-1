It is white like a little bunch of cotton, and I suppose that  that is why I am called a Cottontail Rabbit, though I have heard that  some folks  call me a Gray Rabbit and others a Bush Rabbit.  I guess  I'm  called Bush Rabbit because I like bushy country in which to live.\"    \"I live in the dear Old Briar-patch and just love it.  It is a  mass of bushes and bramble-tangles and is the safest place I know  of.  I have cut little paths all through it just big enough for  Mrs. Peter and myself.  None of our enemies can get at us there,  excepting Shadow the Weasel or Billy Mink.  I have a sort of nest  there where I spend my time when I am not running about.  It is  called a form and I sit in it a great deal.\"    \"In summer I eat clover, grass and other green things, and I just  love to get over into Farmer Brown's garden.  In winter I have to  take what I can get, and this is mostly bark from young trees,  buds and tender twigs of bushes, and any green plants I can find  under the snow.  I can run fast for a short distance, but only  for a short distance.  That is why I like thick brush and  bramble-tangles.  There I can dodge.  I don't know any one who can beat  me at dodging.  If Reddy Fox or Bowser the Hound surprises me away from  the dear Old Briar-patch I run for the nearest hollow log or hole in the  ground.  Sometimes in summer I dig a hole for myself, but not often.  It  is much easier to use a hole somebody else has dug.  When I want to  signal my friends I thump the ground with my hind feet.  Jumper does the  same thing.  I forgot to say I don't like water.\"    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"You are thinking of that cousin of  yours, the Marsh Rabbit who lives way down in the Sunny South,\"  said she.    Peter looked a wee bit foolish and admitted that he was. Jumper  the Hare was all interest at once.  You see, he had never heard  of this cousin.    \"That was a very good account of yourself, Peter,\" said Old Mother  Nature.  \"Now take a look at your cousin, Jumper the Hare, and  tell me how he differs from you.\"    Peter took a long look at Jumper, and then, as before, scratched  one ear with a long hind foot.  \"In the first place,\" said he,  \"Jumper is considerably bigger than I.  He has very long hind legs  and his ears are very long.  In summer he wears a brown coat, but  in winter he is all white but the tips of those long ears, and  those are black.  Because his coat changes so, he is called the  varying Hare.  He likes the Green Forest where the trees grow  close together, especially those places where there are a great  many young trees.  He's the biggest member of our family.  I  guess that's all I know about Cousin Jumper.\"    \"That is very good, Peter, as far as it goes,\" said Old Mother  Nature.  \"You have made only one mistake.  Jumper is not the  biggest of his family.\"    Both Peter and Jumper opened their eyes very wide with surprise.  \"Also,\" continued Old Mother Nature, \"you forgot to mention the  fact that Jumper never hides in hollow logs and holes in the  ground as you do.  Why don't you, Jumper?\"    \"I wouldn't feel safe there,\" replied Jumper rather timidly.  \"I  depend on my long legs for safety, and the way I can dodge around  trees and bushes.  I suppose Reddy Fox may be fast enough to catch  me in the open, but he can't do it where I can dodge around trees  and bushes.  That is why I stick to the Green Forest.  If you please,  Mother Nature, what is this about a cousin who likes to swim?\"    Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled.  \"We'll get to that later on,\"  said she.  \"Now, each of you hold up a hind foot and tell me what  difference you see.\"    Peter and Jumper each held up a hind foot and each looked first at  his own and then at the other's.  \"They look to me very much  alike, only Jumper's is a lot longer and bigger than mine,\" said  Peter.  Jumper nodded as if he agreed.    \"What's the matter with your eyes?\" demanded Old Mother Nature.  \"Don't you see that Jumper's foot is a great deal broader than  yours, Peter, and that his toes are spread apart, while yours are  close together?\"    Peter and Jumper looked sheepish, for it was just as Old Mother  Nature had said.  Jumper's foot really was quite different from  that of Peter.  Peter's was narrow and slim.    \"That is a very important difference,\" declared Old Mother Nature.  \"Can you guess why I gave you those big feet, Jumper?\"    Jumper slowly shook his head.  \"Not unless it was to make me  different,\" said he.    \"I'm surprised,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"Yes, indeed, I'm  surprised.  You ought to know by this time that I never give  anybody anything without a purpose.  What happens to those big  feet of yours in the winter, Jumper?\"    \"Nothing that I know of, excepting that the hair grows out long  between my toes,\" Jumper replied.    \"Exactly,\" snapped Old Mother Nature.  \"And when the hair does this  you can travel over light snow without sinking in.  It is just as  if you had snowshoes.  That is why you are often called a Snowshoe  Rabbit.  I gave you those big feet and make the hair grow out every  winter because I know that you depend on your legs to get away from  your enemies.  You can run over the deep snow where your enemies  break through.  Peter, though he is small and lighter than you are,  cannot go where you can.  But Peter doesn't need to depend always  on his legs to save his life.  There is one thing more that I want  you both to notice, and that is that you both have quite a lot of  short hairs on the soles of you feet.  That is where you differ  from that cousin of yours down in the Sunny South.  He has only  a very few hairs on his feet.  That is so he can swim better.\"    \"If you please, Mother Nature, why is that cousin of ours so fond  of the water?\" piped up Peter.    \"Because,\" replied Old Mother Nature, \"he lives in marshy country  where there is a great deal of water.  He is very nearly the same  size as you, Peter, and looks very much like you.  But his legs  are not quite so long, his ears are a little smaller, and his tail  is brownish instead of white.  He is a poor runner and so in time  of danger he takes to the water.  For that matter, he goes swimming  for pleasure.  The water is warm down there, and he dearly loves  to paddle about in it.  If a Fox chases him he simply plunges into  the water and hides among the water plants with only his eyes and  his nose out of water.\"    \"Does he make his home in the water like Jerry Muskrat?\" asked  Peter innocently.    Mother Nature smiled and shook her head.  \"Certainly not,\" she  replied.  \"His home is on the ground.  His babies are born in a  nest made just as Mrs. Peter makes her nest for your babies, and  Mrs. Jumper makes a nest for Jumper's babies.  It is made of grass  and lined with soft fur which Mrs. Rabbit pulls from her own  breast, and it is very carefully hidden.  By the way, Peter how do  your babies differ from the babies of your Cousin Jumper?\"    Peter shook his head.  \"I don't know,\" said he.  \"My babies don't  have their eyes open when they are born, and they haven't any hair.\"    Jumper pricked up his long ears.  \"What's that?\" said he.  \"Why, my babies have their eyes open and have the dearest little  fur coats!\"    Old Mother Nature chuckled.  \"That is the difference,\" said she.  \"I guess both of you have learned something.\"    \"You said a little while ago that Jumper isn't the biggest of our  family,\" said Peter.  \"If you please, who is?\"    \"There are several bigger than Jumper,\" replied Old Mother Nature,  and smiled as she saw the funny look of surprise on the faces of  Peter and Jumper.  \"There is one way up the Frozen North and there  are two cousins way out in the Great West.  They are as much  bigger than Jumper as Jumper is bigger than you, Peter.  But I  haven't time to tell you about them now.  If you really want to  learn about them, be here promptly at sun-up to-morrow morning.  Hello!  Here comes Reddy Fox, and he looks to me as if a good  breakfast would not come amiss.  Let me see what you have learned  about taking care of yourselves.\"    Peter and Jumper gave one startled look in the direction Mother  Nature was pointing.  Sure enough, there was Reddy Fox.  Not far  away was a hollow log.  Peter wasted no time in getting to it.  In fact, he left in such a hurry that he forgot to say good-by to  Old Mother Nature.  But she didn't mind, for she quite understood  Peter's feelings, and she laughed when she saw his funny little  white tail disappear inside the hollow log.  As for Jumper, he  promptly took to his long legs and disappeared with great bounds,  Reddy Fox racing after him.        CHAPTER III  More of Peter's Long-Legged Cousins    At sun-up the next morning Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were on  hand promptly for their next lesson.  Old Mother Nature smiled as  she saw the eager curiosity shining in their eyes.  She didn't wait  for them to ask questions.  \"Yesterday,\" said she, \"I told you  about your water-loving cousin, the Marsh Rabbit.  You have another  relative down there in the Sunny South who is almost as fond of  the water.  Some folks call him the Swamp Rabbit.  Others call him  the Swamp Hare.  The latter is really the best name for him, because  he is a true Hare.  He lives in swamps instead of marshes, but he is  a splendid swimmer and fond of the water.  When he is chased by an  enemy he makes for the nearest point or stream.\"    \"How big is he?\" asked Jumper.    \"Just about your size, Jumper,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"If  anything, he is a little bit heavier.  But because his hair lies  much smoother than yours, you probably would look a little bit  bigger if you were sitting beside him.  As with his cousin, the  Marsh Rabbit, the hair on his feet is thin.  His toes are rather  long and he can spread them widely, which is a great help in  swimming.  He doesn't have to take to the water as his little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#3)"],[1," in the North-Western Provinces of India, where I  myself happened to reside, ample opportunities were afforded me of  knowing and observing the Rev. Jas. Kennedy and his work. And I am  therefore able, and glad, to say that no man was ever better placed than  he was for gaining a thorough acquaintance with Hindustan and the  various races inhabiting it, during the four decades of which he treats.  I have met with none whose calm and sagacious judgment might more surely  enable him to form correct conclusions, nor whose high and scrupulous  principle should impart to the reader greater confidence in the fair and  truthful statement of them.    I regard this book as possessing a rare interest, not only for the  missionary student, but equally so for the general reader. The amount of  information it contains, descriptive, social, evangelistic, and even  political, is astonishing; and the discursive and, in part,  autobiographical form in which it is written, renders it so easy, that  he who runs may read. The contrast is drawn graphically, and with a  light and lively pen, between the state of things fifty years ago and  that which now prevails: the exchange of slow and cumbrous means of  conveyance for those which enable you in these days to perform the  journey of weeks in, you might say, as many hours; and the not less  marked advance in education and intelligence. The retrospect, material  as well as moral, social, and religious, is useful in many ways.    But that which lends its chief value to this work is the faithful  picture of missionary labour--its trials and difficulties, its results,  rewards, and prospects. During the considerable period brought under  review, standing by, as I did, and looking carefully on, I can  unhesitatingly attest, as a whole, the correctness of my friend's  statements, and the reasonableness of the lessons he would draw  therefrom. This book should be read by every one who wishes to acquaint  himself with the attitude of Christian agencies towards the people of  India, and of these towards the Gospel. There is here a fertile field of  facts and materials for thought. The author resorts to no roseate  colouring, nor any kind of varnish. Nothing is unduly sanguine. All is  tempered by sound judgment and wise discretion.    If I may add a word from my own experience, it is this--Let my  fellow-countrymen and countrywomen in India give their countenance to  the Missionaries labouring around them. They well deserve it, but too  often are allowed to stand alone. The loss is theirs who keep aloof, and  neglect the man and his work. While our people are running to and fro in  the busy whirl of Indian life--some hasting to be rich, others engrossed  in the labours of administration--higher things are too frequently  forgotten. The spiritual life is prone to fade and droop. Many men--and  women as well as men--who would at home be cultivating some corner of  the Master's vineyard, begin to forget that similar obligations follow  after them in their private walk and life abroad. Against these  deteriorating tendencies, to mingle with the missionary band affords a  wholesome antidote. For myself, I can never be thankful enough that in  my early Indian life I found valued friends in the missionary circle,  not only of the highest mental culture, but of a devoted Christian  heart; and was privileged with their intimacy to the end. Among them I  cannot refrain from naming such noble Missionaries as Perkins, Smith,  and Leupolt, French, Stuart, Welland, and Shackell, Owen, Humphrey,  Budden and Watt, Hoernle, and Pfander--that grand apologist to the  Mahometans--all of whose friendship I enjoyed, as well as that of the  Author himself. If some of these were men the like of whom we may not  soon look upon again--a galaxy of rare appearance--yet, as we may learn  from these pages, the field is in the present day stocked even more  plentifully than ever it was before. Opportunities of cultivating in  this field Christian friendship--and may I not add Christian work, and  that for Ladies also--are happily multiplying all around; and I can  promise an ample reward to such as make a faithful use of them.    In conclusion, I will only say that I am much mistaken if this work  fails to take its place as a standard book of reference in every library  of missionary labour and Christian work abroad.                                                                    W. MUIR.  16th September, 1884.          CHAPTER I.    VOYAGE TO INDIA.      In 1837 I was accepted by the London Missionary Society as one of its  agents. On September 15, 1838, I embarked at Portsmouth with thirty  other passengers on the _Duke of Buccleugh_, a vessel of 650 tons  burthen, and landed in Calcutta on January 19, 1839, _en route_ to  Benares, to which I had been appointed. The only land we sighted from  Portsmouth to Saugar Island was a rock in the Indian Ocean. The time we  thus spent at sea was four months and five days. Every now and then  speedier voyages were made, but a few years previously this voyage would  have been deemed rapid. The _Duke of Buccleugh_, on her next voyage to  India, went to pieces on a sandbank at the mouth of the Hoogly, but  happily the weather was moderate, and passengers and crew were saved.    The route by the Cape of Good Hope has been abandoned for passengers for  many years, and now Bombay is reached by the Straits of Gibraltar and  the Suez Canal in a month, sometimes in less, while another week is  required for the voyage to Calcutta. Those who travel with the Indian  mails across the Continent of Europe can reach their port in less than  three weeks, and distant parts of India by rail in four weeks or less.    All on board--officials returning to their posts, and persons going out  for the first time--were delighted to find the voyage coming to an end;  but new-comers like myself were under the spell of novelty, which gave  new interest to everything we saw. At Kedgeree, near the mouth of the  Hoogly, the Post Office boat came to our ship with welcome letters from  friends, who were looking out for our arrival. The level land on each  side of the river, with its rich tropical vegetation; the numerous  villages on the banks, with their beehive-like huts; the craft on the  river, large and small, many of them so heavily laden as to bring them  down almost to the water's edge; the little boats, with plantains and  other fruits, which tried to attach themselves to our ship in the hope  of getting purchasers; the strange appearance of the people, with their  only covering of cloth round the middle--all gave us a thrill of  excitement which can be known only in similar circumstances. Then, we  were about to set foot on the great land, of which we had read much, to  which we had looked with the deepest interest, and where we purposed to  spend our days in the service of Christ. Though so many years have since  elapsed, we can yet vividly remember the peculiar feeling of that time.    The day before we landed, the Native agent of the mercantile house to  which our ship was consigned made his appearance with letters and fresh  supplies. To the surprise of us new-comers, roast beef was on our  dinner-table that day. We thought it strange that in the land where the  cow was worshipped, beef should be one of the first things brought to  us.    Our missionary friends in Calcutta had heard of the arrival of our ship,  and arranged for our accommodation. Some of them came on board when we  anchored in the Hoogly, off Fort William, and gave us a hearty welcome.  We were right glad to find ourselves on land again.    [Sidenote: THE CITY OF PALACES.]    Calcutta is a hundred miles from the sea, but the country is so level  that the tide runs up in great strength many miles beyond, and the tidal  wave, which comes in at certain times, is very dangerous to small craft,  and requires care on the part of large ships. The great trade of the  city is shown by the vast number of ships at anchor in the river, many  of them stately vessels of large tonnage, of which in our day many are  steamers.    On landing, a stranger gets the impression that Calcutta is rightly  called the city of palaces. On the great plain adjoining the river, at  some distance from each other, are two notable objects--Fort William and  Government House. Beyond the plain lies Chowringhee, a range of lofty  houses extending for more than a mile, with balconies and flat roofs,  giving one an impression of grandeur, which is scarcely sustained when  more nearly seen, as that which looked at a distance like marble is  found to be stucco and plaster. Behind Chowringhee are a number of wide  streets with similar, but generally smaller houses, each apart, with  offices and servants' houses in the enclosure. When entering the city  one sees that strange combination of meanness and dirt with grandeur  with which travellers in Eastern lands are so familiar. In the  neighbourhood of Government House there are a number of shops in the  European fashion, but a very large proportion of the business of  Calcutta, we suppose the most of it, is carried on in bazaars, in which  there are no showy shops, but where there is abundance of goods of every  description. When we went to India, and for many years afterwards, in  front of these shops were open sewers, over which customers had to pass  on slabs of stone. Amidst houses for Europeans, even in the most  aristocratic part of the city, were native houses of every description,  many of them miserable grass huts.    Since the time of which I speak, some forty-five years ago, Calcutta has  been greatly improved. It has been drained, supplied with good water,  instead of being dependent on great open tanks, to which all had access,  which no arrangement could keep tolerably pure, and is lit with gas.  Open sewers are no longer to be seen, and from the best parts of the  city many native houses have"]]]
