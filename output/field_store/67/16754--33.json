And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken  unto them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering  them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising  God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was  spoken unto them.    (_Luke_ ii. 8-20.)      THE PLACE OF THE NATIVITY.    The evangelist Matthew tells us that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of  Judaea in the days of Herod the king;\" and Justin Martyr, who was born  at Shechem and lived less than a century after the time of Christ,  places the scene of the Nativity in a cave. Over this cave has risen  the Church and Convent of the Nativity, and there is a stone slab with  a star cut in it to mark the spot where the Saviour was born. Dean  Farrar, who has been at the place, says: \"It is impossible to stand in  the little Chapel of the Nativity, and to look without emotion on the  silver star let into the white marble, encircled by its sixteen  everburning lamps, and surrounded by the inscription, '_Hic de Virgine  Maria Jesus Christus natus est_.'\"    To visit such a scene is to have the thoughts carried back to the  greatest event in the world's history, for it has been truly said that  the birth of Christ was the world's second birthday.      Now, death is life! and grief is turn'd to joy!      Since glory shone on that auspicious morn,    When God incarnate came, not to destroy,      But man to save and manhood's state adorn!      W. F. D.    [Illustration: The Nativity by Sandro Botticelli  Centre Portion of Picture in National Gallery]    THE WORD \"CHRISTMAS\": ITS ORTHOGRAPHY AND MEANING.    \"Christmas\" (pronounced Kris'mas) signifies \"Christ's Mass,\" meaning  the festival of the Nativity of Christ, and the word has been  variously spelt at different periods. The following are obsolete forms  of it found in old English writings: Crystmasse, Cristmes, Cristmas,  Crestenmes, Crestenmas, Cristemes, Cristynmes, Crismas, Kyrsomas,  Xtemas, Cristesmesse, Cristemasse, Crystenmas, Crystynmas, Chrystmas,  Chrystemes, Chrystemasse, Chrystymesse, Cristenmas, Christenmas,  Christmass, Christmes. Christmas has also been called _Noel_ or  _Nowel_. As to the derivation of the word _Noel_, some say it is a  contraction of the French _nouvelles_ (tidings), _les bonnes  nouvelles_, that is \"The good news of the Gospel\"; others take it as  an abbreviation of the Gascon or Provencal _nadaue_, _nadal_, which  means the same as the Latin _natalis_, that is, _dies natalis_, \"the  birthday.\" In \"The Franklin's Tale,\" Chaucer alludes to \"Nowel\" as a  festive cry at Christmastide: \"And 'Nowel' crieth every lusty man.\"  Some say _Noel_ is a corruption of _Yule_, _Jule_, or _Ule_, meaning  \"The festival of the sun.\" The name _Yule_ is still applied to the  festival in Scotland, and some other places. Christmas is represented  in Welsh by _Nadolig_, which signifies \"the natal, or birth\"; in  French by _Noel_; and in Italian by _Il Natale_, which, together with  its cognate term in Spanish, is simply a contraction of _dies  natalis_, \"the birthday.\"      CHRISTMAS: blest Feast of the Nativity!    H eaven made thy lowly shrine    R esplendent with the gift of the eternal Deity    I n whom we live and move, whose large benignity    S pared not His Son divine:    T hat well-beloved Son by God was given,    M ankind to save with His redeeming blood;    A nd Jesus freely left the bliss of Heaven,    S uffering death, to achieve our lasting good.--W. F. D.    [Illustration]          _CHAPTER II_.    THE EARLIER CELEBRATIONS OF THE FESTIVAL.      THE EARLIER CELEBRATIONS.    [Illustration: GROUP FROM THE ANGELS' SERENADE THEODORE MINTROP]    The Angels' Song has been called the first Christmas Carol, and the  shepherds who heard this heavenly song of peace and goodwill, and went  \"with haste\" to the birthplace at Bethlehem, where they \"found Mary,  and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger,\" certainly took part in  the first celebration of the Nativity. And the Wise Men, who came  afterwards with presents from the East, being led to Bethlehem by the  appearance of the miraculous star, may also be regarded as taking part  in the first celebration of the Nativity, for the name Epiphany (now  used to commemorate the manifestation of the Saviour) did not come  into use till long afterwards, and when it was first adopted among the  Oriental Churches it was designed to commemorate both the birth and  baptism of Jesus, which two events the Eastern Churches believed to  have occurred on January 6th. Whether the shepherds commemorated the  Feast of the Nativity annually does not appear from the records of the  Evangelists; but it is by no means improbable that to the end of their  lives they would annually celebrate the most wonderful event which  they had witnessed.    [Illustration: ADORATION OF THE MAGI (Relievo.)  From Pulpit of Pisa Nicola: Pisano]    Within thirty years after the death of our Lord, there were churches  in Jerusalem, Caesarea, Rome, and the Syrian Antioch. In reference to  the latter, Bishop Ken beautifully says:--      \"Fair Antioch the rich, the great,    Of learning the imperial seat,        You readily inclined,        To light which on you shined;    It soon shot up to a meridian flame,    You first baptized it with a Christian name.\"    Clement, one of the Apostolic Fathers and third Bishop of Rome, who  flourished in the first century, says: \"Brethren, keep diligently  feast-days, and truly in the first place the day of Christ's birth.\"  And according to another of the early Bishops of Rome, it was ordained  early in the second century, \"that in the holy night of the Nativity  of our Lord and Saviour, they do celebrate public church services and  in them solemnly sing the Angels' Hymn, because also the same night He  was declared unto the shepherds by an angel, as the truth itself doth  witness.\"    But, before proceeding further with the historical narrative, it will  be well now to make more particular reference to the fixing of the  date of the festival.      FIXING THE DATE OF CHRISTMAS.    Whether the 25th of December, which is now observed as Christmas Day,  correctly fixes the period of the year when Christ was born is still  doubtful, although it is a question upon which there has been much  controversy. From Clement of Alexandria it appears, that when the  first efforts were made to fix the season of the Advent, there were  advocates for the 20th of May, and for the 20th or 21st of April. It  is also found that some communities of Christians celebrated the  festival on the 1st or 6th of January; others on the 29th of March,  the time of the Jewish Passover: while others observed it on the 29th  of September, or Feast of Tabernacles. The Oriental Christians  generally were of opinion that both the birth and baptism of Christ  took place on the 6th of January. Julius I., Bishop of Rome (A.D.  337-352), contended that the 25th of December was the date of Christ's  birth, a view to which the majority of the Eastern Church ultimately  came round, while the Church of the West adopted from their brethren  in the East the view that the baptism was on the 6th of January. It  is, at any rate, certain that after St. Chrysostom Christmas was  observed on the 25th of December in East and West alike, except in the  Armenian Church, which still remains faithful to January 6th. St.  Chrysostom, who died in the beginning of the fifth century, informs  us, in one of his Epistles, that Julius, on the solicitation of St.  Cyril of Jerusalem, caused strict inquiries to be made on the subject,  and thereafter, following what seemed to be the best authenticated  tradition, settled authoritatively the 25th of December as the  anniversary of Christ's birth, the _Festorum omnium metropolis_, as it  is styled by Chrysostom. It may be observed, however, that some have  represented this fixing of the day to have been accomplished by St.  Telesphorus, who was Bishop of Rome A.D. 127-139, but the authority  for the assertion is very doubtful. There is good ground for  maintaining that Easter and its accessory celebrations mark with  tolerable accuracy the anniversaries of the Passion and Resurrection  of our Lord, because we know that the events themselves took place at  the period of the Jewish Passover; but no such precision of date can  be adduced as regards Christmas. Dr. Geikie[1] says: \"The _season_ at  which Christ was born is inferred from the fact that He was six months  younger than John, respecting the date of whose birth we have the help  of knowing the time of the annunciation during his father's  ministrations in Jerusalem. Still, the whole subject is very  uncertain. Ewald appears to fix the date of the birth as five years  earlier than our era. Petavius and Usher fix it as on the 25th of  December, five years before our era; Bengel, on the 25th of December,  four years before our era; Anger and Winer, four years before our era,  in the spring; Scaliger, three years before our era, in October; St.  Jerome, three years before our era, on December 25th; Eusebius, two  years before our era, on January 6th; and Ideler, seven years before  our era, in December.\" Milton, following the immemorial tradition of  the Church, says that--      \"It was the winter wild.\"    But there are still many who think that the 25th of December does not  correspond with the actual date of the birth of Christ, and regard the  incident of the flocks and shepherds in the open field, recorded by  St. Luke, as indicative of spring rather than winter. This incident,  it is thought, could not have taken place in the inclement month of  December, and it has been conjectured, with some probability, that the  25th of December was chosen in order to substitute the purified joy of  a Christian festival for the license of the _Bacchanalia_ and  _Saturnalia_ which were kept at that season.
