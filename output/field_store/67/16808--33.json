Prince Paser, however, is an old hand at dealing with such complaints.  With a smiling face he promises that fifty sacks of corn shall be sent  to the cemetery immediately, with oil to correspond. Only the workmen  must go back to their work at once, and there must be no more chasing of  poor Secretary Amen-nachtu. Otherwise, he can do nothing. The workmen  grumble a little. They have been put off with promises before, and have  got little good of them. But they have no leader bold enough to start a  riot, and they have no weapons, and the spears and bows of the Prince's  Nubians look dangerous. Finally they turn, and disappear, grumbling,  down the street from which they came; and Prince Paser, with a shrug of  his shoulders, goes indoors again. Whether the fifty sacks of corn are  ever sent or not, is another matter. Strikes, you see, were not unknown,  even so long ago as this.          CHAPTER III    A DAY IN THEBES--_Continued_      Having seen the settlement of the masons' strike, we wander up into the  heart of the town. The streets are generally narrow and winding, and  here and there the houses actually meet overhead, so that we pass out of  the blinding sunlight into a sort of dark tunnel. Some of the houses  are large and high; but even the largest make no display towards the  street. They will be fine enough inside, with bright courts surrounded  with trees, in the midst of which lies a cool pond of water, and with  fine rooms decorated with gay hangings; but their outer walls are almost  absolutely blank, with nothing but a heavy door breaking the dead line.  We pass by some quarters where there is nothing but a crowd of mud huts,  packed so closely together that there is only room for a single  foot-passenger to thread his way through the narrow alleys between them.  These are the workmen's quarters, and the heat and smell in them are so  overpowering that one wonders how people can live in such places.    By-and-by we come out into a more open space--one of the bazaars of the  city--where business is in full swing. The shops are little shallow  booths quite open to the front; and all the goods are spread out round  the shopkeeper, who squats cross-legged in the middle of his property,  ready to serve his customers, and invites the attention of the  passers-by by loud explanations of the goodness and cheapness of his  wares. All sorts of people are coming and going, for a Theban crowd  holds representatives of nearly every nation known. Here are the  townsfolk, men and women, out to buy supplies for their houses, or to  exchange the news of the day; peasants from the villages round about,  bringing in vegetables and cattle to barter for the goods which can only  be got in the town; fine ladies and gentlemen, dressed elaborately in  the latest Court fashion, with carefully curled wigs, long pleated robes  of fine transparent linen, and dainty, brightly-coloured sandals turned  up at the toes. At one moment you rub shoulders with a Hittite from  Kadesh, a conspicuous figure, with his high-peaked cap, pale complexion,  and heavy, pointed boots. He looks round him curiously, as if thinking  that Thebes would be a splendid town to plunder. Then a priest of high  rank goes by, with shaven head, a panther skin slung across his shoulder  over his white robe, and a roll of papyrus in his hand. A Sardinian of  the bodyguard swaggers along behind him, the ball and horns on his  helmet flashing in the sunlight, his big sword swinging in its sheath as  he walks; and a Libyan bowman, with two bright feathers in his leather  skull-cap, looks disdainfully at him as he shoulders his way through the  crowd.    All around us people are buying and selling. Money, as we know it, has  not yet been invented, and nearly all the trade is done by means of  exchange. When it comes to be a question of how many fish have to be  given for a bed, or whether a load of onions is good value for a chair,  you can imagine that there has to be a good deal of argument. Besides,  the Egyptian dearly loves bargaining for the mere excitement of the  thing, and so the clatter of tongues is deafening. Here and there one or  two traders have advanced a little beyond the old-fashioned way of  barter, and offer, instead of goods, so many rings of copper, silver, or  gold wire. A peasant who has brought in a bullock to sell is offered 90  copper \"uten\" (as the rings are called) for it; but he loudly protests  that this is robbery, and after a long argument he screws the merchant  up to 111 \"uten,\" with 8 more as a luck-penny, and the bargain is  clinched. Even then the rings have still to be weighed that he may be  sure he is not being cheated. So a big pair of balances is brought out;  the \"uten\" are heaped into one scale, and in the other are piled weights  in the shape of bulls' heads. Finally, he is satisfied, and picks up his  bag of rings; but the wily merchant is not done with him yet. He spreads  out various tempting bargains before the eyes of the countryman, and,  before the latter leaves the shop, most of the copper rings have found  their way back again to the merchant's sack.    A little farther on, the Tyrian traders, to whom the cargo of our galley  is consigned, have their shop. Screens, made of woven grass, shelter it  from the sun, and under their shade all sorts of gorgeous stuffs are  displayed, glowing with the deep rich colours, of which the Tyrians  alone have the secret since the sack of Knossos destroyed the trade of  Crete. Beyond the Tyrian booth, a goldsmith is busily employed in his  shop. Necklets and bracelets of gold and silver, beautifully inlaid with  all kinds of rich colours, hang round him; and he is hard at work, with  his little furnace and blowpipe, putting the last touches to the welding  of a bracelet, for which a lady is patiently waiting.    In one corner of the bazaar stands a house which makes no display of  wares, but, nevertheless, seems to secure a constant stream of  customers. Workmen slink in at the door, as though half ashamed of  themselves, and reappear, after a little, wiping their mouths, and not  quite steady in their gait. A young man, with pale and haggard face,  swaggers past and goes in, and, as he enters the door, one bystander  nudges another and remarks: \"Pentuere is going to have a good day again;  he will come to a bad end, that young man.\"    By-and-by the door opens again, and Pentuere comes out staggering. He  looks vacantly round, and tries to walk away; but his legs refuse to  carry him, and, after a stumble or two, he falls in a heap and lies in  the road, a pitiful sight. The passers-by jeer and laugh at him as he  lies helpless; but one decent-looking man points him out to his young  son, and says: \"See this fellow, my son, and learn not to drink beer to  excess. Thou dost fall and break thy limbs, and bespatter thyself with  mud, like a crocodile, and no one reaches out a hand to thee. Thy  comrades go on drinking, and say, 'Away with this fellow, who is drunk.'  If anyone should seek thee on business, thou art found lying in the dust  like a little child.\"    But in spite of much wise advice, the Egyptian, though generally  temperate, is only too fond of making \"a good day,\" as he calls it, at  the beerhouse. Even fine ladies sometimes drink too much at their great  parties, and have to be carried away very sick and miserable. Worst of  all, the very judges of the High Court have been known to take a day off  during the hearing of a long case, in order to have a revel with the  criminals whom they were trying; and it is not so long since two of them  had their noses cut off, as a warning to the rest against such shameful  conduct.    Sauntering onwards, we gradually get near to the sacred quarter of the  town, and can see the towering gateways and obelisks of the great  temples over the roofs of the houses. Soon a great crowd comes towards  us, and the sounds of trumpets and flutes are heard coming from the  midst of it. Inquiring what is the meaning of the bustle, we are told  that one of the images of Amen, the great god of Thebes, is being  carried in procession as a preliminary to an important service which is  to take place in the afternoon, and at which the King is going to  preside. Stepping back under the doorway of a house, we watch the  procession go past. After a group of musicians and singers, and a number  of women who are dancing as they go, and shaking curious metal rattles,  there comes a group of six men, who form the centre of the whole crowd,  and on whom the eyes of all are fixed.    They are tall, spare, keen-looking men, their heads clean shaven, their  bodies wrapped in pure white robes of the beautiful Egyptian linen. On  their shoulders they carry, by means of two long poles, a model of a  Nile boat, in the midst of which rises a little shrine. The shrine is  carefully draped round with a veil, so as to hide the god from curious  eyes. But just in front of the doorway where we are standing a small  stone pillar rises from the roadway, and when the bearers come to this  point, the bark of the god is rested on the top of the pillar. Two  censer-bearers come forward, and swing their censers, wafting clouds of  incense round the shrine; a priest lifts up his voice, loudly intoning a  hymn of praise to the great god who creates and sustains all things; and  a few of the by-standers lay before the bark offerings of flowers,  fruit, and eatables of various kinds. Then comes the solemn moment. Amid  breathless silence, the veil of the shrine is slowly drawn aside, and  the faithful can see a little wooden image, about 18 inches high,  adorned with tall plumes, carefully dressed, and painted with green and  black. The revelation of this little doll, to a Theban crowd the most  sacred object in all the world, is hailed with shouts of wonder and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],[0,"The Adventures of Buster Bear (#3)"],[1,"him a thief?\"    \"They were no more your fish than mine,\" protested Billy Mink.    \"Well, _our_ fish, then! He stole _our_ fish, if you like that any  better. That makes him just as much a thief, doesn't it?\" growled  Little Joe.    Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun and slowly  winked one of his great, goggly eyes. \"There comes a foolish green fly,\"  said he. \"Who does he belong to?\"    \"Nobody!\" snapped Little Joe. \"What have foolish green flies got to do  with my--I mean _our_ fish?\"    \"Nothing, nothing at all,\" replied Grandfather Frog mildly. \"I was just  hoping that he would come near enough for me to snap him up; then he  would belong to me. As long as he doesn't, he doesn't belong to any one.  I suppose that if Buster Bear should happen along and catch him, he  would be stealing from me, according to Little Joe.\"    \"Of course not! What a silly idea! You're getting foolish in your old  age,\" retorted Little Joe.    \"Can you tell me the difference between the fish that you haven't caught  and the foolish green flies that I haven't caught?\" asked Grandfather  Frog.    Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.    \"You take my advice, Little Joe Otter,\" continued Grandfather Frog, \"and  always make friends with those who are bigger and stronger and smarter  than you are. You'll find it pays.\"    [Illustration: \"You take my advice, Little Joe Otter,\" continued  Grandfather Frog. _Page 26._]          VI    LITTLE JOE OTTER TAKES GRANDFATHER FROG'S ADVICE        Who makes an enemy a friend,    To fear and worry puts an end.    Little Joe Otter found that out when he took Grandfather Frog's advice.  He wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid of Buster Bear. No one ever  likes to admit being afraid, least of all Little Joe Otter. And really  Little Joe has a great deal of courage. Very few of the little people of  the Green Forest or the Green Meadows would willingly quarrel with him,  for Little Joe is a great fighter when he has to fight. As for all those  who live in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they  let Little Joe have his own way in everything.    Now having one's own way too much is a bad thing. It is apt to make one  selfish and thoughtless of other people and very hard to get along with.  Little Joe Otter had his way too much. Grandfather Frog knew it and  shook his head very soberly when Little Joe had been disrespectful to  him.    \"Too bad. Too bad! Too bad! Chug-a-rum! It is too bad that such a fine  young fellow as Little Joe should spoil a good disposition by such  selfish heedlessness. Too bad,\" said he.    So, though he didn't let on that it was so, Grandfather Frog really was  delighted when he heard how Buster Bear had been too smart for Little  Joe Otter. It tickled him so that he had hard work to keep a straight  face. But he did and was as grave and solemn as you please as he  advised Little Joe always to make friends with any one who was bigger  and stronger and smarter than he. That was good common sense advice, but  Little Joe just sniffed and went off declaring that he would get even  with Buster Bear yet. Now Little Joe is good-natured and full of fun as  a rule, and after he had reached home and his temper had cooled off a  little, he began to see the joke on himself,--how when he had worked so  hard to frighten the fish in the little pools of the Laughing Brook so  that Buster Bear should not catch any, he had all the time been driving  them right into Buster's paws. By and by he grinned. It was a little  sheepish grin at first, but at last it grew into a laugh.    \"I believe,\" said Little Joe as he wiped tears of laughter from his  eyes, \"that Grandfather Frog is right, and that the best thing I can do  is to make friends with Buster Bear. I'll try it to-morrow morning.\"    So very early the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best fishing  pool he knew of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught the biggest  trout he could find. It was so big and fat that it made Little Joe's  mouth water, for you know fat trout are his favorite food. But he didn't  take so much as one bite. Instead he carefully laid it on an old log  where Buster Bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that  way. Then he hid near by, where he could watch. Buster was late that  morning. It seemed to Little Joe that he never would come. Once he  nearly lost the fish. He had turned his head for just a minute, and when  he looked back again, the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster couldn't  have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't possibly  have gotten out of sight again.    Little Joe darted over to the log and looked on the other side. There  was the fat trout, and there also was Little Joe's smallest cousin,  Shadow the Weasel, who is a great thief and altogether bad. Little Joe  sprang at him angrily, but Shadow was too quick and darted away. Little  Joe put the fish back on the log and waited. This time he didn't take  his eyes off it. At last, when he was almost ready to give up, he saw  Buster Bear shuffling along towards the Laughing Brook. Suddenly Buster  stopped and sniffed. One of the Merry Little Breezes had carried the  scent of that fat trout over to him. Then he came straight over to where  the fish lay, his nose wrinkling, and his eyes twinkling with pleasure.    \"Now I wonder who was so thoughtful as to leave this fine breakfast  ready for me,\" said he out loud.    \"Me,\" said Little Joe in a rather faint voice. \"I caught it especially  for you.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Buster, and his eyes twinkled more than ever. \"I  think we are going to be friends.\"    \"I--I hope so,\" replied Little Joe.          VII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAS NO LUCK AT ALL      Farmer Brown's boy tramped through the Green Forest, whistling merrily.  He always whistles when he feels light-hearted, and he always feels  light-hearted when he goes fishing. You see, he is just as fond of  fishing as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or Buster Bear. And now he  was making his way through the Green Forest to the Laughing Brook, sure  that by the time he had followed it down to the Smiling Pool he would  have a fine lot of trout to take home. He knew every pool in the  Laughing Brook where the trout love to hide, did Farmer Brown's boy,  and it was just the kind of a morning when the trout should be hungry.  So he whistled as he tramped along, and his whistle was good to hear.    When he reached the first little pool he baited his hook very carefully  and then, taking the greatest care to keep out of sight of any trout  that might be in the little pool, he began to fish. Now Farmer Brown's  boy learned a long time ago that to be a successful fisherman one must  have a great deal of patience, so though he didn't get a bite right away  as he had expected to, he wasn't the least bit discouraged. He kept very  quiet and fished and fished, patiently waiting for a foolish trout to  take his hook. But he didn't get so much as a nibble. \"Either the trout  have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise,\" muttered Farmer  Brown's boy, as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool.    There the same thing happened. He was very patient, very, very patient,  but his patience brought no reward, not so much as the faintest kind of  a nibble. Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the next pool, and there was  a puzzled frown on his freckled face. Such a thing never had happened  before. He didn't know what to make of it. All the night before he had  dreamed about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would have the next  day, and now--well, if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that  splendid dinner would never be anything but a dream.    \"If I didn't know that nobody else comes fishing here, I should think  that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or  else frightened them so that they are all in hiding,\" said he, as he  trudged on to the next little pool. \"I never had such bad luck in all my  life before. Hello! What's this?\"    There, on the bank beside the little pool, were the heads of three  trout. Farmer Brown's boy scowled down at them more puzzled than ever.  \"Somebody _has_ been fishing here, and they have had better luck than I  have,\" thought he. He looked up the Laughing Brook and down the Laughing  Brook and this way and that way, but no one was to be seen. Then he  picked up one of the little heads and looked at it sharply. \"It wasn't  cut off with a knife; it was bitten off!\" he exclaimed. \"I wonder now if  Billy Mink is the scamp who has spoiled my fun.\"    Thereafter he kept a sharp lookout for signs of Billy Mink, but though  he found two or three more trout heads, he saw no other signs and he  caught no fish. This puzzled him more than ever. It didn't seem possible  that such a little fellow as Billy Mink could have caught or frightened  all the fish or have eaten so many. Besides, he didn't remember ever  having known Billy to leave heads around that way. Billy sometimes  catches more fish than he can eat, but then he usually hides them. The  farther he went down the Laughing Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's  boy grew. It made him feel very queer. He would have felt still more  queer if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had been  before him were watching him and chuckling to themselves. They were  Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear.          VIII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY FEELS HIS HAIR RISE        'Twas just a sudden odd surprise    Made Farmer Brown's boy's hair to rise.    That's a funny thing for hair to do--rise up all of a sudden--isn't it?  But that is just what the hair on Farmer Brown's boy's head did the day  he went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all. There are  just two things that make hair rise--anger and fear. Anger sometimes  makes the hair on the back and neck of Bowser the Hound and of some  other little people bristle and stand up,"]]]
