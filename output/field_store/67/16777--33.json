If the  remark is accompanied by a smile, the performer straightens up and  tries to overcome the fault; but if the comment is made with a snarl  there is a tightening up of muscles, an increased tension of the  nerves, and the performer is more than likely to do worse the next  time.    There is a difference of opinion between the conductor and some  performer about fingering or bowing, phrasing or interpretation, and a  quarrel seems imminent; but the conductor refuses to take the matter  too seriously, and, having ample authority for his own viewpoint,  proceeds as he has begun, later on talking it over with the performer,  and perhaps giving him a reason for his opinion.    Humor is thus seen to have the same effect upon a body of musicians as  oil applied to machinery, and musical machinery seems to need more of  this kind of lubrication than almost any other variety.    But the conductor must distinguish carefully between sarcastic wit,  which laughs _at_, and humor, which laughs _with_. In a book bearing  the copyright date of 1849, the writer distinguishes between the two,  in the following words:[1]         Humor originally meant moisture, a signification it       metaphorically retains, for it is the very juice of the       mind, enriching and fertilizing where it falls. Wit laughs       at; humor laughs with. Wit lashes external appearances, or       cunningly exchanges single foibles into character; humor       glides into the heart of its object, looks lovingly upon the       infirmities it attacks, and represents the whole man. Wit is       abrupt, scornful ...; humor is slow and shy, insinuating its       fun into your heart.    [Footnote 1: Whipple, _Literature and Life_, p. 91.]    [Sidenote: THE VALUE OF A CHEERFUL ATTITUDE]    The conductor with a sense of humor will ordinarily have the advantage  also of being cheerful in his attitude toward the performers, and this  is an asset of no mean significance. It is a well-known psychophysical  fact that the human body does much better work when the mind is free  from care, and that in any profession or vocation, other things being  equal, the worker who is cheerful and optimistic will perform his  labor much more efficiently at the expense of considerably less mental  and bodily energy than he who is ill-humored, worried, fretful, and  unable to take a joke. But the _foreman_ who possesses this quality of  cheerfulness and humor is doubly fortunate, for he not only secures  the beneficial results in his own case, but by his attitude frequently  arouses the same desirable state of mind and body in those who are  working under him. It is particularly because of this latter fact that  the conductor needs to cultivate a cheerful, even a humorous outlook,  especially in the rehearsal. As the result of forming this habit, he  will be enabled to give directions in such a way that they will be  obeyed cheerfully (and consequently more effectively); he will find it  possible to rehearse longer with less fatigue both to himself and to  his musical forces; and he will be able to digest his food and to  sleep soundly after the rehearsal because he is not worrying over  trivial annoyances that, after all, should have been dismissed with a  laugh as soon as they appeared. There must not of course be so much  levity that the effectiveness of the rehearsal will be endangered, but  there is not much likelihood that this will happen; whereas there  seems to be considerable danger that our rehearsals will become too  cold and formal. A writer on the psychology of laughter states that  \"laughter is man's best friend\";[2] and in another place (p. 342) says  that the smile always brings to the mind \"relaxation from strain.\"    [Footnote 2: Sully, _An Essay on Laughter_.]    [Sidenote: THE VALUE OF IMAGINATION IN CONDUCTING]    Creative imagination is an inborn quality--\"a gift of the gods\"--and  if the individual does not possess it, very little can be done for him  in the artistic realm. Constructive or creative imagination implies  the ability to combine known elements in new ways--_to use the mind  forwards_, as it were. The possession of this trait makes it possible  to picture to oneself how things are going to look or sound or feel  before any actual sense experience has taken place; to see into  people's minds and often find out in advance how they are going to  react to a projected situation; to combine chemical elements in new  ways and thus create new substances; to plan details of organization  in a manufacturing establishment or in an educational institution, and  to be able to forecast how these things are going to work out.    It is this quality of creative imagination that enables the inventor  to project his mind into the future and see a continent spanned by  railways and telephones, and the barrier of an ocean broken down by  means of wireless and aeroplane; and in every case the inventor works  with old and well-known materials, being merely enabled by the power  of his creative faculties (as they are erroneously called) to combine  these known materials in new ways.    In the case of the musician, such creative imagination has always been  recognized as a _sine qua non_ of original composition, but its  necessity has not always been so clearly felt in the case of the  performer. Upon analyzing the situation it becomes evident, however,  that the performer cannot possibly get from the composer his real  message unless he can follow him in his imagination, and thus  re-create the work. As for adding anything original to what the  composer has given, this is plainly out of the question unless the  interpreter is endowed somewhat extensively with creative imagination;  and the possession of this quality will enable him to introduce such  subtle variations from a cut-and-dried, merely _accurate_ rendition as  will make his performance seem really spontaneous, and will inevitably  arouse a more enthusiastic emotional response in the listeners.    Weingartner sums up the value of imagination in the final paragraph of  one of the few really valuable books on conducting at our disposal.[3]         More and more I have come to think that what decides the       worth of conducting is the degree of suggestive power that       the conductor can exercise over the performers. At the       rehearsals he is mostly nothing more than a workman, who       schools the men under him so conscientiously and precisely       that each of them knows his place and what he has to do       there; he first becomes an artist when the moment comes for       the production of the work. Not even the most assiduous       rehearsing, so necessary a prerequisite as this is, can so       stimulate the capacities of the players as the force of       imagination of the conductor. It is not the transference of       his personal will, but the mysterious act of creation that       called the work itself into being takes place again in him,       and transcending the narrow limits of reproduction, he       becomes a new-creator, a self-creator.    [Footnote 3: Weingartner, _On Conducting_, translated by Ernest  Newman, p. 56.]    This quality is indispensable to all musicians, be they creators or  performers, but is especially desirable in the conductor, for he needs  it not only from the standpoint of interpretation, as already noted,  but from that of manager or organizer. Upon this latter point we shall  have more to say later, but it may be well to state just here that if  the conductor could imagine what was going on in the minds of his  players or singers, and could see things from their viewpoint; if he  could forecast the effect of his explanatory directions or of his  disciplinary rulings, nine-tenths of all the quarreling, bickering,  and general dissatisfaction that so frequently mar the work of any  musical organization could easily be eliminated. We might also add  that if the conductor could only foresee the effect upon his audiences  of certain works, or of certain interpretations, his plans would  probably often be materially altered.    [Sidenote: ORGANIZING ABILITY AND A SENSE OF LEADERSHIP]    But the conductor must be more than a humorous-minded and imaginative  musician. He must also (especially in these modern times) be an  organizer, a business man, a leader. The qualities of leadership and  organizing ability are so closely connected that we shall for the most  part treat them together in our discussion, and they are so important  that a fairly extensive analysis will be attempted.    In an article on Schumann in _Grove's Dictionary_ Dr. Philip Spitta,  the well-known historian and critic, comments upon the conducting of  this famous composer as follows:[4]         Schumann was sadly wanting in the real talent for       conducting. All who ever saw him conduct or played under his       direction are agreed on this point. Irrespective of the fact       that conducting for any length of time tired him out, he had       neither the collectedness and prompt presence of mind, nor       the sympathetic faculty, nor the enterprising dash, without       each of which conducting in the true sense is impossible.       He even found difficulty in starting at a given tempo; nay,       he even sometimes shrank from giving any initial beat, so       that some energetic pioneer would begin without waiting for       the signal, and without incurring Schumann's wrath! Besides       this, any thorough practice, bit by bit, with his orchestra,       with instructive remarks by the way as to the mode of       execution, was impossible to this great artist, who in this       respect was a striking contrast to Mendelssohn. He would       have a piece played through, and if it did not answer to his       wishes, have it repeated. If it went no better the second or       perhaps third time, he would be extremely angry at what he       considered the clumsiness, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#3)"],[1,"young man did easily.    Thereupon Sir Ector strove with all his strength to draw the sword  forth again, but though he pulled till he sweated, he could not stir  the sword.    'Now you essay it,' he said to his son. But naught that Sir Kay could  do availed.    'Now do you try,' he bade Arthur.    Arthur lightly grasped the handle with one hand, and the sword came out  without hindrance.    Therewith Sir Ector sank to his knees, and Sir Kay also. And they bared  their heads.    'Alas,' said Arthur, 'my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye so  to me?'    'Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so,' said Sir Ector, 'for I was  never your father. I wot well ye are of higher blood than I weened. For  Merlin delivered you to me while yet ye were a babe.'    The tears came into Arthur's eyes when he knew that Sir Ector was not  his father, for the young man had loved him as if he were of his own  blood.    'Sir,' said Ector unto Arthur, 'will ye be my good and kind lord when  ye are king?'    'Ah, if this be true as ye say,' cried Arthur, 'ye shall desire of me  whatsoever ye may, and I shall give it you. For both you and my good  lady and dear mother your wife have kept and loved me as your own.'    'Sir,' said Sir Ector, 'I crave a boon of you, that while you live,  your foster-brother, Sir Kay, shall be high seneschal of all your  lands.'    'That shall be done, and never man shall have that office but him,  while he and I live,' replied Arthur.    Then hastily Sir Ector rode to the archbishop, and told him how and by  whom the sword had been achieved from the stone. Thereupon the  archbishop let call a great meeting on Twelfth Day of all the kings and  barons.    So on the day appointed, all men gathered in the churchyard of St.  Paul's, and the tent was removed from about the stone. From day dawn to  the evening the kings and princes and lords strove each in his turn to  draw the sword from the stone. But none of them availed to move it.    While they stood about, dark of look, gnawing their lips with rage and  disappointment, the archbishop turned privily to Sir Ector and bade him  bring Arthur.    The young man came, quietly clad in a tunic of brown samite, of medium  height, with curly hair above a fair face of noble, though mild mien.  As he came among the richly clad nobles, they looked haughtily at him,  and wondered who he was and why he came, for as yet none had been told  that the sword had been drawn by him.    The archbishop, tall, white-haired and reverend, called Arthur to him  and said in grave tones:    'My son, I have heard a strange tale of thee, and whether it be true or  false, God shall decide. Now, therefore, do ye take hold upon this  sword and essay to draw it from the stone.'    The proud barons, some with looks amazed and others with sneering  laughter, pressed about the young man as he stepped towards the stone.  Arthur took the handle of the sword with his right hand, and the sword  seemed to fall into his grasp.    Thereat arose great cries of rage, and angry looks flashed forth, and  many a hand went to dagger haft.    'Ho, archbishop!' cried King Lot, fiercely striding towards the tall  ecclesiastic, 'what wizard's brat are you foisting upon us here to draw  the sword by magic?'    ''Tis a trick!' cried Nentres of Garlot, his bluff manner falling from  him, and all the savage anger gleaming from his eyes. 'A trick that  shall not blind men such as we!'    'Who is this beggar's boy that is put forth to shame us kings and  nobles?' said King Mark, and his hand sought his dagger as he  disappeared among the crowd and wormed his way towards where stood  young Arthur. But Sir Ector and Sir Kay, seeing the threatening looks  of all, had quickly ranged themselves beside young Arthur, and with  them went Sir Bedevere, Sir Baudwin and Sir Ulfius, three noble lords  who had loved King Uther well.    'Peace, lords!' said the old archbishop, calmly meeting the raging  looks about him. 'Ye know what words are about the sword, and this  youth hath drawn the sword. I know naught of tricks or wizardry, but I  think high Heaven hath chosen this way of showing who shall be lord of  this land, and I think this young man is rightful King of us all.'    ''Tis some base-born churl's son that the wizard Merlin would foist  upon us!' cried the barons. 'We will have none of him!'    'A shame and dishonour it is, so to try to overrule us, kings and lords  of high lineage, with an unknown youth,' cried others.    'We will have the sword put back and set a watch over it,' cried King  Uriens, 'and we will meet here again at Candlemas, and essay the sword.  And at that time, my lord archbishop, thou shalt do the proper rites to  exorcise all evil powers, and then we will try the sword once more.'    So was it agreed by all, and ten knights watched day and night about  the stone and the sword.    But it befell at Candlemas as it had befallen at Twelfth Day, that for  all their strength and might, none of the kings or barons could draw  forth the sword; but into the hand of the unknown Arthur the weapon  seemed to fall.    Whereat they were all sore aggrieved and rageful, and resolved that  they would have yet another trial at Easter. It befell at the feast of  Easter as it had befallen before, and this time the kings and lords for  angry spite would have fallen upon Arthur and slain him, but the  archbishop threatened them with the most dreadful ban of Holy Church.  They forbore, therefore, and went aside, and declared that it was their  will to essay the sword again at the high feast of Pentecost.    By Merlin's advice the young Arthur went never about, unless the five  friends of Uther were with him, that is to say, Sir Ector and his son  Sir Kay, Sir Bedevere, Sir Baudwin and Sir Ulfius. And though at divers  times men were found skulking or hiding in the horse-stall, the dark  wood by the hall, or the bend in the lane, in places where Arthur might  pass, no harm came to him by reason of the loving watch of those noble  knights.    Again at the feast of Pentecost men gathered in the churchyard of St.  Paul's, and the press of people was such that no man had ever seen the  like. Once more the kings and princes and great barons, to the number  of forty-nine, came forward, and each in turn pulled and drew at the  sword in the stone until the sweat stood on their brows. Nevertheless,  though the sword point was but the width of a palm in the stone, not  the mightiest of them could move it by the breadth of a hair.    King Mark of Tintagel was the last of them who had to stand back at  length, baffled and raging inwardly. Many were the evil looks that  would have slain Arthur as he stood among his friends.    Then a cry came from among the common people, and so strong was it that  the nobles looked as if they hated to hear it.    'Let Arthur draw the sword!' was the call from a thousand throats.    The venerable archbishop came and took Arthur by the hand, and led him  towards the sword. Again the young man held the rich pommel with his  single hand, and that which none of the forty-nine great men could do,  he did as easily as if he but plucked a flower.    A fierce cry leaped from among the thousands of the common people.    'Arthur shall be our King!' they cried. 'Arthur is our King! We will no  longer deny him!'    Many of the princes and barons cried out with the commons that this was  their will also; but eleven of the most powerful and ambitious showed  by their arrogant and angry gestures that they refused to own Arthur as  their lord.    For a long time the uproar raged, the cries of the common folk becoming  fiercer and more menacing against the counter cries of the eleven kings  and their adherents.    At length from among the people there came the governor of London, who,  in his rich robes of office, leaped upon the stone where but lately the  sword had been.    'My lords, I speak the will of the commons,' he cried, and at his voice  all were silent. 'We have taken counsel together, and we will have  Arthur for our King. We will put him no more in delay, for we all see  that it is God's will that he shall be our King, and who that holdeth  against him, we will slay.'    With that he got down from the stone, kneeled before Arthur, put the  keys of the city in his hands, and rendered homage unto him. The great  multitude kneeled likewise, bowing their bare heads, and cried him  mercy because they had denied him so long.    Because they feared the great multitude, the eleven kings kneeled with  them, but in their hearts was rage and rebellion.    Then Arthur took the sword between his hands and, going into the  church, he laid it on the high altar, and the archbishop blessed him.  Then, since Arthur was as yet unknighted, King Kador of Cornwall, who  was brother of King Uther, made him a knight.    Standing up in the sight of all the people, lords and commons, Arthur  laid his left hand upon the holy relics; then, lifting up his right  hand, he swore that he would be a true king, to stand forth as their  ruler in justice and mercy, to keep them from oppression, to redress  their wrongs, and to establish right throughout the length and breadth  of his dominions.    Men went forth from the church in great joy, for now they had a king  they loved, and they felt that the land was safe from civil strife and  the griefs of war.    When Arthur in his palace at London had received the homage of all the  lords and princes from the lands south of Humber, he appointed his  officers. Sir Kay he made seneschal or steward, and Sir Baudwin was  made constable, and Sir Ulfius he named chamberlain of his court. By  the counsel of Merlin he made Sir Bedevere Warden of the Northern  Marches, for the lands of the eleven kings lay mostly in the country  north of Trent, and though those princes had yielded lip service to  Arthur, Merlin knew that in their hearts they nurtured the seeds of  conspiracy.
