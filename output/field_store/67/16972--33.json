The fisherman only glanced  once at the royal weapon, but it was enough to make him notice its  richness and to arouse his suspicions. Nevertheless, he went on rowing  towards the frigate. M. Marouin seeing him disappear in the distance,  left his brother on the beach, and bowing once more to the king,  returned to the house to calm his wife's anxieties and to take the  repose of which he was in much need.    Two hours later he was awakened. His house was to be searched in its  turn by soldiers. They searched every nook and corner without finding a  trace of the king. Just as they were getting desperate, the brother came  in; Maroum smiled at him; believing the king to be safe, but by the  new-comer's expression he saw that some fresh misfortune was in the  wind. In the first moment's respite given him by his visitors he went up  to his brother.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I hope the king is on board?\"    \"The king is fifty yards away, hidden in the outhouse.\"    \"Why did he come back?\"    \"The fisherman pretended he was afraid of a sudden squall, and refused  to take him off to the brig.\"    \"The scoundrel!\"    The soldiers came in again.    They spent the night in fruitless searching about the house and  buildings; several times they passed within a few steps of the king, and  he could hear their threats and imprecations. At last, half an hour  before dawn, they went away. Marouin watched them go, and when they were  out of sight he ran to the king. He found him lying in a corner, a  pistol clutched in each hand. The unhappy man had been overcome by  fatigue and had fallen asleep. Marouin hesitated a moment to bring him  back to his wandering, tormented life, but there was not a minute to  lose. He woke him.    They went down to the beach at once. A morning mist lay over the sea.  They could not see anything two hundred yards ahead. They were obliged  to wait. At last the first sunbeams began to pierce this nocturnal mist.  It slowly dispersed, gliding over the sea as clouds move in the sky. The  king's hungry eye roved over the tossing waters before him, but he saw  nothing, yet he could not banish the hope that somewhere behind that  moving curtain he would find his refuge. Little by little the horizon  came into view; light wreaths of mist, like smoke, still floated about  the surface of the water, and in each of them the king thought he  recognised the white sails of his vessel. The last gradually vanished,  the sea was revealed in all its immensity, it was deserted. Not daring  to delay any longer, the ship had sailed away in the night.    \"So,\" said the king, \"the die is cast. I will go to Corsica.\"    The same day Marshal Brune was assassinated at Avignon.          II--CORSICA      Once more on the same beach at Bonette, in the same bay where he had  awaited the boat in vain, still attended by his band of faithful  followers, we find Murat on the 22nd August in the same year. It was no  longer by Napoleon that he was threatened, it was by Louis XVIII that he  was proscribed; it was no longer the military loyalty of Marshal Brune  who came with tears in his eyes to give notice of the orders he had  received, but the ungrateful hatred of M. de Riviere, who had set a  price [48,000 francs.] on the head of the man who had saved his  own.[Conspiracy of Pichegru.] M. de Riviere had indeed written to the  ex-King of Naples advising him to abandon himself to the good faith and  humanity of the King of France, but his vague invitation had not seemed  sufficient guarantee to the outlaw, especially on the part of one who  had allowed the assassination almost before his eyes of a man who  carried a safe-conduct signed by himself. Murat knew of the massacre of  the Mamelukes at Marseilles, the assassination of Brune at Avignon; he  had been warned the day before by the police of Toulon that a formal  order for his arrest was out; thus it was impossible that he should  remain any longer in France. Corsica, with its hospitable towns, its  friendly mountains, its impenetrable forests, was hardly fifty leagues  distant; he must reach Corsica, and wait in its towns, mountains, and  forests until the crowned heads of Europe should decide the fate of the  man they had called brother for seven years.    At ten o'clock at, night the king went down to the shore. The boat which  was to take him across had not reached the rendezvous, but this time  there was not the slightest fear that it would fail; the bay had been  reconnoitred during the day by three men devoted to the fallen fortunes  of the king--Messieurs Blancard, Langlade, and Donadieu, all three naval  officers, men of ability and warm heart, who had sworn by their own  lives to convey Murat to Corsica, and who were in fact risking their  lives in order to accomplish their promise. Murat saw the deserted shore  without uneasiness, indeed this delay afforded him a few more moments of  patriotic satisfaction.    On this little patch of land, this strip of sand, the unhappy exile  clung to his mother France, for once his foot touched the vessel which  was to carry him away, his separation from France would be long, if not  eternal. He started suddenly amidst these thoughts and sighed: he had  just perceived a sail gliding over the waves like a phantom through the  transparent darkness of the southern night. Then a sailor's song was  heard; Murat recognised the appointed signal, and answered it by burning  the priming of a pistol, and the boat immediately ran inshore; but as  she drew three feet of water, she was obliged to stop ten or twelve feet  from the beach; two men dashed into the water and reached the beach,  while a third remained crouching in the stern-sheets wrapped in his  boat-cloak.    \"Well, my good friends,\" said the king, going towards Blancard and  Langlade until he felt the waves wet his feet \"the moment is come, is it  not? The wind is favourable, the sea calm, we must get to sea.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Langlade, \"yes, we must start; and yet perhaps it would  be wiser to wait till to-morrow.\"    \"Why?\" asked Murat.    Langlade did not answer, but turning towards the west, he raised his  hand, and according to the habit of sailors, he whistled to call the  wind.    \"That's no good,\" said Donadieu, who had remained in the boat. \"Here are  the first gusts; you will have more than you know what to do with in a  minute.... Take care, Langlade, take care! Sometimes in calling the wind  you wake up a storm.\"    Murat started, for he thought that this warning which rose from the sea  had been given him by the spirit of the waters; but the impression was a  passing one, and he recovered himself in a moment.    \"All the better,\" he said; \"the more wind we have, the faster we shall  go.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Langlade, \"but God knows where it will take us if it  goes on shifting like this.\"    \"Don't start to-night, sire,\" said Blancard, adding his voice to those  of his two companions.    \"But why not?\"    \"You see that bank of black cloud there, don't you? Well, at sunset it  was hardly visible, now it covers a good part of the sky, in an hour  there won't be a star to be seen.\"    \"Are you afraid?\" asked Murat.    \"Afraid!\" answered Langlade. \"Of what? Of the storm? I might as well ask  if your Majesty is afraid of a cannon-ball. We have demurred solely on  your account, sire; do you think seadogs like ourselves would delay on  account of the storm?\"    \"Then let us go!\" cried Murat, with a sigh.    \"Good-bye, Marouin.... God alone can reward you for what you have done  for me. I am at your orders, gentlemen.\"    At these words the two sailors seized the king end hoisted him on to  their shoulders, and carried him into the sea; in another moment he was  on board. Langlade and Blancard sprang in behind him. Donadieu remained  at the helm, the two other officers undertook the management of the  boat, and began their work by unfurling the sails. Immediately the  pinnace seemed to rouse herself like a horse at touch of the spur; the  sailors cast a careless glance back, and Murat feeling that they were  sailing away, turned towards his host and called for a last time--    \"You have your route as far as Trieste. Do not forget my wife!...  Good-bye-good-bye----!\"    \"God keep you, sire!\" murmured Marouin.    And for some time, thanks to the white sail which gleamed through the  darkness, he could follow with his eyes the boat which was rapidly  disappearing; at last it vanished altogether. Marouin lingered on the  shore, though he could see nothing; then he heard a cry, made faint by  the distance; it was Murat's last adieu to France.    When M. Marouin was telling me these details one evening on the very  spot where it all happened, though twenty years had passed, he  remembered clearly the slightest incidents of the embarkation that  night. From that moment he assured me that a presentiment of misfortune  seized him; he could not tear himself away from the shore, and several  times he longed to call the king back, but, like a man in a dream, he  opened his mouth without being able to utter a sound. He was afraid of  being thought foolish, and it was not until one o'clock that is, two and  a half hours after the departure of the boat-that he went home with a  sad and heavy heart.    The adventurous navigators had taken the course from Toulon to Bastia,  and at first it seemed to the king that the sailors' predictions were  belied; the wind, instead of getting up, fell little by little, and two  hours after the departure the boat was rocking without moving forward or  backward on the waves, which were sinking from moment to moment. Murat  sadly watched the phosphorescent furrow trailing behind the little boat:  he had nerved himself to face a storm, but not a dead calm, and without  even interrogating his companions, of whose uneasiness he took no  account, he lay down in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1,"codes  This information is presented in Appendix D:  Cross-Reference List of  Country Data Codes and Appendix E:  Cross-Reference List of  Hydrographic Data Codes.  This appendix includes the US Government  approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and  Internet codes for land entities.  The appendix also includes the  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart  and Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Imagery and  Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved  a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4  standard for country data codes.    Date of information  In general, information available as of 1 January 2003 was used in the  preparation of this edition.    Death rate  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death  rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a  country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all  ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt - external  This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents  repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.    Dependency status  This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation  The US Government has diplomatic relations with 185 independent states,  including 183 of the 189 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US  has diplomatic relations with 1 independent state that is not in the UN  - Holy See.    Diplomatic representation in the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, chancery, telephone, FAX,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation from the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Disputes - international  This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving borders  or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,  geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does  not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US  Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index  This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of  family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz  curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number  of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the  ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45  degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45  degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the  closer its Lorenz curve to the 45-degree line and the lower its Gini  index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more  unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve  from the 45-degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-  Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with  perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree  line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with  perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal  axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.    Economic aid - donor  This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations to  developing countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as  financial assistance that is concessional in character, has the main  objective to promote economic development and welfare of the less  developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private  flows.    Economic aid - recipient  This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and  statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development  Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and  from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included  in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.  Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The  entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.    Economy  This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,  and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy - overview  This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree  of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most  important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It  also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most  recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key  future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption  This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy  between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in  transmission and distribution.    Electricity - exports  This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - imports  This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - production  This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed in kilowatt-  hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted  for as loss in transmission and distribution.    Electricity - production by source  This entry states the percentage share of electricity generated from  each energy source. These are fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, and other  (solar, geothermal, and wind).    Elevation extremes  This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point.    Entities  Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. \"Independent state\" refers to a people politically  organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.  \"Dependencies\" and \"areas of special sovereignty\" refer to a broad  category of political entities that are associated in some way with an  independent state. \"Country\" names used in the table of contents or for  page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,  dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic  entities.
