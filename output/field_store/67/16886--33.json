[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#3)"],[1," one was so simple that I mastered it in less than a minute and played it  thus--    First I asked Cicciu to tell me the time.  He shut up his eyes, showed  his teeth and covered his face all over with grinning wrinkles.  Then I  asked him the time again.  He replied in the same way.  I asked him again  and so on till he had overcome his shyness and at last pulled out his  watch which was found to consist of a circular piece of tin with a paper  watch-face gummed on to one side of it.  Then we all laughed at the  contrast between this and what his elaborate watch-chain had led us to  expect.    While we were still laughing, Angelo drove up to the window and said it  was time to go, so we began saying \"Good-bye.\"  Some of the men departed  before us, but the brigadier, the corporal and one or two others were  going our way.  The brigadier fetched his gun in order to enjoy the chase  and we all got out of the window.  Angelo accompanied the hunting party,  but the corporal came in the carriage with me and Cicciu drove us round  the barley-field to the Temple of Apollo to wait for the others.  On the  way we heard the brigadier firing off his gun and wondered what sport he  was having, and I took a leaf out of his book of politeness and asked the  corporal his age and particulars of his family, after which, of course, I  had to tell him all about myself and to promise I would take the first  opportunity of visiting him in his home to clink glasses and drink wine  with him.    We went all over the ruins while waiting for the hunting party which  presently joined us.  The brigadier was satisfied with his sport and  permitted himself the pleasure of offering me the spoils--two birds the  size of sparrows--which Angelo was to cook for supper.  Then we said  \"Good-bye,\" promising to exchange picture postcards when I should be back  in England.  The corporal, however, was still going our way and we took  him in the carriage a little further.  We asked if he could not come with  us all the way to Castelvetrano and he seemed inclined to do so, but he  had to patrol the coast in the direction of Marsala from eleven o'clock  that night till eleven the next morning, and it was so annoying because,  as he must go to Castelvetrano in a few days, he might almost just as  well come with us now.  We hoped he would see his way to doing so and he  hesitated and appeared to be on the point of yielding, but finally made  the Herculean choice of duty before pleasure on the very sensible ground  that, if it should be discovered he had deserted his post, he would be  put into prison for two months.  With the brigadier and all the guards in  the secret, it seemed impossible that he should escape detection, so we  pressed the invitation no further and took leave of him after exchanging  names and addresses and promising to send postcards to one another.    As we drove away I could not but draw a comparison in my mind between the  corporal's refusal of my invitation and mine of his, and I was ashamed of  myself for the way I had scamped the bathing festa.  I had made another  engagement and there was an end of it.  The corporal, on the other hand,  had spared no expense in the manner of his refusal, nothing short of two  months' imprisonment could have prevented him from coming with us.  We  English ought to be able to do this and some of us, I suppose, can, but  there is no Italian who cannot.  The French are polite, but not always to  be trusted.  A Frenchman, speaking of an Englishman to whom I had  introduced him, said to me--    \"He speaks French worse than you do.\"    Any Italian, wishing to express a similar idea, would have said--    \"He speaks Italian, it is true, but not so well as you do.\"    My meditations were interrupted by Angelo who had been taking stock of  our possessions and, on looking into the basket, exclaimed with disgust  that we had been robbed of our fish.  It was the first I had heard about  our fish, but he said the brigadier had given us ten and he had put them  into the basket.  How could they have got out again?  All the afternoon  we had been surrounded by coastguards and policemen whose profession is,  as every one knows, to prevent robbery and to take up thieves.  Angelo  was furious and wanted to drive back and complain to the brigadier, but,  on looking further through the basket, we found there were still two fish  and I said they would be quite enough for supper--with the sparrows--and  he finally agreed that we had better do nothing, it might look as though  we thought the brigadier was not up to his business.    \"And when the tailor is wearing a coat that does not fit him,\" said  Angelo, \"it is rude to tell him of it.\"    So we drove on among the cistus bushes and I asked him about the lottery.  Every Saturday morning ninety cards numbered from one to ninety are put  into a wheel of fortune and a blind-folded child from the orphan asylum  publicly draws out five.  Italy is divided into several districts and a  drawing takes place in the chief town of each, the winning numbers are  telegraphed to the lottery offices all over the country and afterwards  posted up and published in the newspapers.  Any one wishing to try his  luck chooses one or more numbers and buys a ticket and this choosing of  the numbers is a very absorbing business.  In the neighbourhood of  Castelvetrano at that time the favourite numbers were five and twenty-six  and the people were betting on those numbers when they had no special  reason for choosing any others.  Angelo could not tell why these two  numbers were preferred, he could only say that the people found them  sympathetic and, as a matter of fact, twenty-six had come out the day  before.  There are many ways of choosing a number if you find five and  twenty-six unsympathetic; you can wait till something remarkable happens  to you, look it out in \"the useful book that knows\" and then bet on its  number, for everything really remarkable has a number in the book and, if  you do not possess a copy, it can be consulted in a shop as the _Post  Office Directory_ can be consulted in London.  Or, if nothing remarkable  happens to you in real life, perhaps you may have dreamt of a lady in a  white dress, or of a man whetting a scythe, or of meeting a snake in the  road--anything will do, so long as it strikes you at the time.  When you  see the country people coming into town on market day you may be sure  that each one has received instructions from relations and friends at  home to put something on a number for them.    Some make a practice of gambling every week, others only try their luck  when they have a few spare soldi, others only when they have witnessed  something irresistibly striking.  A favourite way of choosing a number is  to get into conversation with certain old monks who have a reputation for  spotting winners, if I may so speak.  You do not ask the monk for a  number outright, you engage him in conversation on general topics and as  he understands what is expected of him, though he pretends he does not,  he will presently make some such irrelevant remark as, \"Do you like  flowers?\" whereupon you rapidly bring the interview to a conclusion and,  if you do not know the number for \"flower,\" you look it out in the book  and bet on it.  It occurred to me that possibly that was what the  brigadier had been doing with me when he took me into his room to wash.    \"Of course it was,\" said Angelo; \"he did not really want you to wash your  hands, he wanted to get a number out of you.\"    \"Did he get one?\" said I.    \"He told me to put his money on 14.\"    \"That must have been because I said I paid 14 francs a metre for this  cloth.  But he changed that afterwards.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Angelo.  \"He thought the number that came out of your  packet of cigarettes would be better.\"    Angelo was not strictly right about the brigadier not wanting me to wash,  he said so merely to agree with me, for in Sicily, among those who have  not become sophisticated by familiarity with money and its little ways  nor cosmopolitanized by travel, and whose civilization remains unmodified  by northern and western customs, it is usual for the host to give his  guest an opportunity to wash after eating.  Sometimes the lady of the  house has herself taken me into her bedroom, poured out the water and  held the basin while I have washed; she has then handed me the towel and  presently escorted me back to the sitting-room.    We soon overtook a man who had caught a rabbit and wanted to sell it for  a lira and a half.  Angelo bargained with him for ever so long and, being  at last satisfied that the rabbit was freshly killed, bought it for a  lira and put it into the basket, saying he would cook it for supper, and  that no doubt the Madonna had sent it to make up for the loss of the  fish.    I asked him what I must do to get a ticket in the lottery for the  following Saturday.  He replied that his cousin would be happy to sell me  one and, if I would settle how much to risk and what number to put it on,  he would take me to the office in the morning.  I said I would risk a  lira, which he thought overdoing it, as he and his friends seldom risked  more than four or five soldi, but there was still the troublesome matter  of the number.  He asked whether anything unusual had happened to me  lately, either in real life or in a dream.  I told him that I seldom  remembered a dream, but that I had had an unusually delightful day in  real life at Selinunte.  In his capacity of padrone he acknowledged the  compliment, but feared there would be no number for that in the book.  Then I asked if there was likely to be a number for having breakfast with  a coastguard as it was the first time I had done so.  He mused and said  no doubt there would be a number for breakfast and another for  coastguard, but not for the combination.  Could not we add the two  numbers together and bet on whatever they amounted to,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#3)"],[1,"ssen: 1874.    ---- ZUR FRAGE NACH DEM URSPRUNG DER ALTBABYLONISCHEN KULTUR.

I.                MESOPOTAMIA.--THE MOUNDS.--THE FIRST SEARCHERS.      1. In or about the year before Christ 606, Nineveh, the great city, was  destroyed. For many hundred years had she stood in arrogant splendor,  her palaces towering above the Tigris and mirrored in its swift waters;  army after army had gone forth from her gates and returned laden with  the spoils of conquered countries; her monarchs had ridden to the high  place of sacrifice in chariots drawn by captive kings. But her time came  at last. The nations assembled and encompassed her around. Popular  tradition tells how over two years lasted the siege; how the very river  rose and battered her walls; till one day a vast flame rose up to  heaven; how the last of a mighty line of kings, too proud to surrender,  thus saved himself, his treasures and his capital from the shame of  bondage. Never was city to rise again where Nineveh had been.    2. Two hundred years went by. Great changes had passed over the land.  The Persian kings now held the rule of Asia. But their greatness also  was leaning towards its decline and family discords undermined their  power. A young prince had rebelled against his elder brother and  resolved to tear the crown from him by main force. To accomplish this,  he had raised an army and called in the help of Grecian hirelings. They  came, 13,000 in number, led by brave and renowned generals, and did  their duty by him; but their valor could not save him from defeat and  death. Their own leader fell into an ambush, and they commenced their  retreat under the most disastrous circumstances and with little hope of  escape.    3. Yet they accomplished it. Surrounded by open enemies and false  friends, tracked and pursued, through sandy wastes and pathless  mountains, now parched with heat, now numbed with cold, they at last  reached the sunny and friendly Hellespont. It was a long and weary march  from Babylon on the Euphrates, near which city the great battle had been  fought. They might not have succeeded had they not chosen a great and  brave commander, Xenophon, a noble Athenian, whose fame as scholar and  writer equals his renown as soldier and general. Few books are more  interesting than the lively relation he has left of his and his  companions' toils and sufferings in this expedition, known in history as  \"The Retreat of the Ten Thousand\"--for to that number had the original  13,000 been reduced by battles, privations and disease. So cultivated a  man could not fail, even in the midst of danger and weighed down by  care, to observe whatever was noteworthy in the strange lands which he  traversed. So he tells us how one day his little army, after a forced  march in the early morning hours and an engagement with some light  troops of pursuers, having repelled the attack and thereby secured a  short interval of safety, travelled on till they came to the banks of  the Tigris. On that spot, he goes on, there was a vast desert city. Its  wall was twenty-five feet wide, one hundred feet high and nearly seven  miles in circuit. It was built of brick with a basement, twenty feet  high, of stone. Close by the city there stood a stone pyramid, one  hundred feet in width, and two"]]]
