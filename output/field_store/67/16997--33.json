Scott received in all something under eight hundred  pounds for the _Lay_, a small amount when contrasted with his gains from  subsequent poems, but a sum so unusual nevertheless that he determined  forthwith to devote as much time to literature as he could spare from  his legal duties; those he still placed foremost, for until near the  close of his life he clung to his adage that literature was \"a good  staff, but a poor crutch.\"    A year before the publication of the _Lay_, Scott had removed to the  small country seat of Ashestiel, in Selkirkshire, seven miles from the  nearest town, Selkirk, and several miles from any neighbor. In the  introductions to the various cantos of _Marmion_ he has given us a  delightful picture of Ashestiel and its surroundings--the swift  Glenkinnon dashing through the estate in a deep ravine, on its way to  join the Tweed; behind the house the rising hills beyond which lay the  lovely scenery of the Yarrow. The eight years (1804-1812) at Ashestiel  were the serenest, and probably the happiest, of Scott's life. Here he  wrote his two greatest poems, _Marmion_ and _The Lady of the Lake_. His  mornings he spent at his desk, always with a faithful hound at his feet  watching the tireless hand as it threw off sheet after sheet of  manuscript to make up the day's stint. By one o'clock he was, as he  said, \"his own man,\" free to spend the remaining hours of light with his  children, his horses, and his dogs, or to indulge himself in his  life-long passion for tree-planting. His robust and healthy nature made  him excessively fond of all out-of-door sports, especially riding, in  which he was daring to foolhardiness. It is a curious fact, noted by  Lockhart, that many of Scott's senses were blunt; he could scarcely,  for instance, tell one wine from another by the taste, and once sat  quite unconscious at his table while his guests were manifesting extreme  uneasiness over the approach of a too-long-kept haunch of venison, but  his sight was unusually keen, as his hunting exploits proved. His little  son once explained his father's popularity by saying that \"it was him  that commonly saw the hare sitting.\" What with hunting, fishing,  salmon-spearing by torchlight, gallops over the hills into the Yarrow  country, planting and transplanting of his beloved trees, Scott's life  at Ashestiel, during the hours when he was \"his own man,\" was a very  full and happy one.    Unfortunately, he had already embarked in an enterprise which was  destined to overthrow his fortunes just when they seemed fairest. While  at school in Kelso he had become intimate with a school fellow named  James Ballantyne, and later, when Ballantyne set up a small printing  house in Kelso, he had given him his earliest poems to print. After the  issue of the _Border Minstrelsy_, the typographical excellence of which  attracted attention even in London, he set Ballantyne up in business in  Edinburgh, secretly entering the firm himself as silent partner. The  good sale of the _Lay_ had given the firm an excellent start; but more  matter was presently needed to feed the press. To supply it, Scott  undertook and completed at Ashestiel four enormous tasks of  editing--the complete works of Dryden and of Swift, the Somers' Tracts,  and the Sadler State Papers. The success of these editions, and the  subsequent enormous sale of Scott's poems and novels, would have kept  the concern solvent in spite of Ballantyne's complete incapacity for  business, but in 1809 Scott plunged recklessly into another and more  serious venture. A dispute with Constable, the veteran publisher and  bookseller, aggravated by the harsh criticism delivered upon _Marmion_  by Francis Jeffrey, editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, Constable's  magazine, determined Scott to set up in connection with the Ballantyne  press a rival bookselling concern, and a rival magazine, to be called  the _Quarterly Review_. The project was a daring one, in view of  Constable's great ability and resources; to make it foolhardy to madness  Scott selected to manage the new business a brother of James Ballantyne,  a dissipated little buffoon, with about as much business ability and  general caliber of character as is connoted by the name which Scott  coined for him, \"Rigdumfunnidos.\" The selection of such a man for such a  place betrays in Scott's eminently sane and balanced mind a curious  strain of impracticality, to say the least; indeed, we are almost  constrained to feel with his harsher critics that it betrays something  worse than defective judgment--defective character. His greatest  failing, if failing it can be called, was pride. He could not endure  even the mild dictations of a competent publisher, as is shown by his  answer to a letter written by one of them proposing some salaried work;  he replied curtly that he was a \"black Hussar\" of literature, and not to  be put to such tame service. Probably this haughty dislike of dictation,  this imperious desire to patronize rather than be patronized, led him to  choose inferior men with whom to enter into business relations. If so,  he paid for the fault so dearly that it is hard for a biographer to  press the issue against him.    For the present, however, the wind of fortune was blowing fair, and all  the storm clouds were below the horizon. In 1808 _Marmion_ appeared, and  was greeted with an enthusiasm which made the unprecedented reception of  the _Lay_ seem lukewarm in comparison. _Marmion_ contains nothing which  was not plainly foreshadowed in the _Lay_, but the hand of the poet has  grown more sure, his descriptive effects are less crude and amateurish,  the narrative proceeds with a steadier march, the music has gained in  volume and in martial vigor. An anecdote is told by Mr. Hutton which  will serve as a type of a hundred others illustrative of the  extraordinary hold which this poetry took upon the minds of ordinary  men. \"I have heard,\" he says, \"of two old men--complete  strangers--passing each other on a dark London night, when one of them  happened to be repeating to himself, just as Campbell did to the  hackney coachman of the North Bridge of Edinburgh, the last lines of the  account of Flodden Field in _Marmion_, 'Charge, Chester, charge,' when  suddenly a reply came out of the darkness, 'On, Stanley, on,' whereupon  they finished the death of _Marmion_ between them, took off their hats  to each other, and parted, laughing.\" _The Lady of the Lake_, which  followed in little more than a year, was received with the same popular  delight, and with even greater respect on the part of the critics. Even  the formidable Jeffrey, who was supposed to dine off slaughtered authors  as the Giant in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" dined off young Englishmen,  keyed his voice to unwonted praise. The influx of tourists into the  Trossachs, where the scene of the poem was laid, was so great as  seriously to embarrass the mail coaches, until at last the posting  charges had to be raised in order to diminish the traffic. Far away in  Spain, at a trying moment of the Peninsular campaign, Sir Adam Ferguson,  posted on a point of ground exposed to the enemy's fire, read to his men  as they lay prostrate on the ground the passage from _The Lady of the  Lake_ describing the combat between Roderick Dhu's Highlanders and the  forces of the Earl of Mar; and \"the listening soldiers only interrupted  him by a joyous huzza when the French shot struck the bank close above  them.\" Such tributes--and they were legion--to the power of his poetry  to move adventurous and hardy men, must have been intoxicating to  Scott; there is small wonder that the success of his poems gave him, as  he says, \"such a _heeze_ as almost lifted him off his feet.\"      III    Scott's modesty was not in danger, but so far as his prudence was  concerned, his success did really lift him off his feet. In 1812, still  more encouraged thereto by entering upon the emoluments of the office of  Clerk of Sessions, the duties of which he had performed for six years  without pay, he purchased Abbotsford, an estate on the Tweed, adjoining  that of the Duke of Buccleugh, his kinsman, and near the beautiful ruins  of Melrose Abbey. Here he began to carry out the dream of his life, to  found a territorial family which should augment the power and fame of  his clan. Beginning with a modest farm house and a farm of a hundred  acres, he gradually bought, planted, and built, until the farm became a  manorial domain and the farm house a castle. He had not gone far in this  work before he began to realize that the returns from his poetry would  never suffice to meet such demands as would thus be made upon his purse.  Byron's star was in the ascendant, and before its baleful magnificence  Scott's milder and more genial light visibly paled. He was himself the  first to declare, with characteristic generosity, that the younger poet  had \"bet\"[3] him at his own craft. As Carlyle says, \"he had held the  sovereignty for some half-score of years, a comparatively long lease of  it, and now the time seemed come for dethronement, for abdication. An  unpleasant business; which, however, he held himself ready, as a brave  man will, to transact with composure and in silence.\"    [Footnote 3: Bested, got the better of.]    But, as it proved, there was no need for resignation. The reign of  metrical romance, brilliant but brief, was past, or nearly so. But what  of prose romance, which long ago, in picking out _Don Quixote_ from the  puzzling Spanish, he had promised himself he would one day attempt? With  some such questioning of the Fates, Scott drew from his desk the sheets  of a story begun seven years before, and abandoned because of the  success of _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_. This story he now completed,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#3)"],[1,"ist. The rule of life in this way is  the \"Law of Christ.\" It is a better law, for us, because its precepts are  not limited to our neighbor. The following is a part, at least, of the  contrast:    THE DECALOGUE GIVEN TO ISRAEL.    \"Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy _neighbor_. Neither  shalt thou desire thy _neighbor's_ wife. Neither shalt thou covet thy  _neighbor's_ house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant,  his ox or his ass, or anything that is thy _neighbor's_. Thou shalt not  commit adultery. Thou shalt not kill.\"    THE LAW OF CHRIST BOUND UPON THE WORLD.    \"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. But I say unto you, love your  enemies. If thou mayest be made free use it rather. Be ye not the servants  of men. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not covet. Whosoever  looketh upon a woman and lusteth after her hath committed adultery already  in his heart.\"    I have presented a sufficient amount of each law to show you a part of the  great contrast which exists on account of the ancient law being given to a  people set apart from all the surrounding nations by a legal wall  interfering with them in their social walks in life. That law was  sufficient for all practical purposes among the Jews. But, since that  \"Middle wall of partition\" has been taken down, it is utterly useless to  talk about a law limited to your neighbor being any longer worthy of God,  or a perfect rule for man's conduct in his associations with all men.  Indeed, it never was a law regulating a man's conduct with all men. The  middle wall was taken out of the way, and Jews and Gentiles have shook  hands in Christian fellowship under the new institution. Let us see how  this was brought about. When the law brings about a separation, nothing  short of law can undo it, and bring about the union of the parties  separated. But, as authority, that controls law, is alone competent to  remove legal results, we must look for this, as a matter of necessity,  lying at the foundation of the new institution. It is just there that we  find it in these words: \"All authority is given unto me in heaven and in  earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name  of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to  observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\" The result of  obedience to this law of Christ is expressed in these words: \"But now, in  Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of  Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down  the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the  enmity; even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make  in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.\" Eph. ii, 13-15. The God  of Abraham said unto Rebecca, \"Two nations are in thy womb.\" Gen. xxv, 23.  This language had its fulfillment in the decendants of Jacob and Esau. The  political history of the children of Jacob begins at Sinai with their  beginning as a nation among the surrounding nations. The law given at  Sinai was a political law, for it was addressed to a community, pertained  to a community, and was accepted by a community.    Such is a political law in the strictest sense of the term. This law was  given to the Jews, the decendants of Jacob. Moses said, \"The Lord our God  made a covenant with us in Horeb. The Lord made not this covenant with our  fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\"  Horeb is a synonymous with Sinai, and means, properly, ground left dry by  water draining off. So, Horeb and Sinai occur in the narrative of the same  event. The children of Jacob are known as a commonwealth, from the giving  of the law onward until their overthrow by the Romans. Paul, speaking of  the Gentiles, in past times, says \"They were aliens to the commonwealth of  Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise.\" The Jews called them  \"dogs.\" This great enmity had its origin in the two-fold consideration of  the Jew being favored in a temporal and political point of view, and the  pride of his heart, which exalted him in his own imagination above even  his moral superiors. This corruption of the heart, with the liability of  its return, being removed by the abrogation of all that was peculiar to  the Jews and their conversion to Christ, Paul says, \"That all are one in  Christ.\" Christ was the bond of union, all were joined to him. But the  same authority that separated them by legislation must legislate with  reference to this grand change that was to take place between these  decendants of Jacob and Esau. The law of commandments separating the Jews  limited them in moral duties to their neighbors. It was unlawful for them  to go in unto one of another nation. It limited them in trade and traffic  to their own countrymen; also limited them to their own people in  matrimonial relations. So God must be heard again, I say, _heard!_ for He  was heard at the giving of the law, which is now to be taken out of the  way. When Jesus took Peter, James and John up in a high mountain and was  transfigured before them, Moses and Elias, the great representatives of  the Patriarchial and Jewish dispensations, appeared unto them and \"a  bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud, which  said, This is my well-beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, HEAR YE HIM.\"  Math. xvii, 5. Here is the authority that gave the institution peculiar to  the Jews legislating with reference to Him whose doings were to end that  system of things, and lead all into \"a new and living way.\" Paul says:  \"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto  the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His  Son.\" So Christ took away the first will and established the second. See  Heb. x, 9. Paul says: \"As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk  ye in Him.\" This relation of duty to the reception of Christ has direct  reference to the character in which we receive him. He was given to  _rule_, to exercise _Lordship_. He is Lord of all. The term Lord signifies  \"ruler by right of possession.\" If He is not Lord of all there is an  abundance of false testimony upon this one subject, and Christianity is  diseased in the head. And if he is Lord of all, then we should leave that  old mountain that shook and burned with fire, and all the political  paraphernalia of Sinai, and consider ourselves complete in Christ, who is  \"_Emanuel_, God with us.\" If any man does this he is not troubled with the  old \"bond woman.\" Jehovah said of Christ: \"I have given Him for a covenant  of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.\" Isaiah xlii, 2. New duties  appear before us in the New Testament, with new obligations lying at their  foundation. Jesus said: \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had  not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sins.\" Again: \"If I had  not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had  sin; but now have they both seen and hated both Me and my Father.\" John  xv, 22-24.    Justification turns no longer upon the ancient law, and the sacrificial  and typical system of blood is no longer the means of pardon. The law  contained a shadow of good things to come, but the body was of Christ. He  that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is  condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only  begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into  the world, and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are  evil. Everything turns in this dispensation upon Christ and his Law. Jesus  told his disciples to teach their converts to observe all things which He  had commanded them to teach, and they filled their mission. Paul said, He  \"shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God,\" \"kept back nothing.\"  With reference to law, he said, \"If any man think himself to be a prophet,  or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things I write are the  commandments of the Lord.\" For the glory of Christ, as his just meed of  praise, it was written, \"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the  name of the Lord Jesus.\" \"Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness  to every one that believeth.\" In this major proposition the minor, of the  seventh-day Sabbath, is involved. The Lord said of Israel, \"I will also  cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her  Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.\" Hosea, ii, 11. No man is threatened,  by Christ or any of his apostles, on account of Sabbath-breaking, or any  of those things which are peculiar to the Jews. But men are threatened for  disobedience to the Gospel of Christ. The New Testament is of Christ. Its  religion is not \"the Jews' religion,\" but Christ's. There was much in the  Old Testament that is in the New, but it is there by the authority of  Christ. Hence, we are \"complete in Him who is the head of all principality  and power.\" Much in the laws of the United States was first in the laws of  England, but we do nothing with reference to English authority. So it is  with us, as respects all who went before Christ, we do nothing in  reference to them, but do all in reference to Christ, and for His name.  The Old Kingdom of Israel, with its political law, statutes and judgments,  has passed away, and Christ reigns \"_all in all_.\" To Him \"be glory and  majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.\" Jude, xxv.            INFIDELS LIVE IN DOUBTING CASTLE.      Having shown that no man in his senses can be an atheist, unless he assume  that he comprehends the universe in his mind, with all its abstract  essences and principles, which assumption would be to make himself  omnipresent and eternal, a god in fact; and having seen that the  proposition of the divine existence and perfections is demonstrable from  the universe, "]]]
