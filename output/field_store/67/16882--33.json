Selim  began to translate:--    \"Man, whosoever thou mayest be that findest this, praise Allah for his  goodness! Whoever snuffs of the dust of this powder, and at the same  time says, MUTABOR, can change himself into any animal, and shall also  understand its language. If he wishes to return to the form of a man,  then let him bow three times to the East, and repeat the same word.  But take thou care, if thou be transformed, that thou laugh not;  otherwise shall the magic word fade altogether from thy remembrance,  and thou shalt remain a beast!\"    When Selim the Learned had thus read, the Caliph was overjoyed. He  made the translator swear to tell no one of their secret, presented  him a beautiful garment, and discharged him. To his Grand-Vizier,  however, he said: \"That I call a good purchase, Mansor! How can I  contain myself until I become an animal! Early in the morning, do thou  come to me. Then will we go together into the country, take a little  snuff out of my box, and hear what is said in the air and in the  water, in the forest and in the field.\"          CHAPTER II.      Scarcely, on the next morning, had the Caliph Chasid breakfasted and  dressed himself, when the Grand-Vizier appeared, to accompany him, as  he had commanded, on his walk. The Caliph placed the box with the  magic powder in his girdle, and having commanded his train to remain  behind, set out, all alone with Mansor, upon their expedition. They  went at first through the extensive gardens of the Caliph, but looked  around in vain for some living thing, in order to make their strange  experiment. The Vizier finally proposed to go farther on, to a pond,  where he had often before seen many storks, which, by their grave  behavior and clattering, had always excited his attention. The Caliph  approved of the proposition of his Vizier, and went with him to the  pond. When they reached it they saw a stork walking gravely to and  fro, seeking for frogs, and now and then clattering at something  before her. Presently they saw, too, another stork hovering far up in  the air.    \"I will wager my beard, most worthy sire,\" exclaimed the Grand-Vizier,  \"that these two long-feet are even now carrying on a fine conversation  with one another. How would it be, if we should become storks?\"    \"Well spoken!\" answered the Caliph. \"But first, we will consider how  we may become men again.--Right! Three times bow to the East, and  exclaim 'MUTABOR!' then will I be Caliph once more, and thou Vizier.  Only, for the sake of Heaven, laugh not, or we are lost!\"    While the Caliph was thus speaking, he saw the other stork hovering  over their heads, and sinking slowly to the ground. He drew the box  quickly out of his girdle, and took a good pinch; then he presented it  to the Grand-Vizier, who also snuffed some of the powder, and both  exclaimed \"MUTABOR!\" Immediately their legs shrivelled away and became  slender and red; the handsome yellow slippers of the Caliph and his  companion became misshapen stork's feet; their arms turned to wings;  the neck extended up from the shoulders, and was an ell long; their  beards had vanished, and their whole bodies were covered with soft  feathers.    \"You have a beautiful beak, my lord Grand-Vizier,\" exclaimed the  Caliph after long astonishment. \"By the beard of the Prophet, in my  whole life I have not seen any thing like it!\"    \"Most humble thanks!\" responded the Vizier, as he bowed. \"But if I  dared venture it, I might assert that your Highness looks almost as  handsome when a stork, as when a Caliph. But suppose, if it be  pleasing to you, that we observe and listen to our comrades, to see,  if we actually understand Storkish.\"    Meanwhile the other stork reached the earth. He cleaned his feet with  his bill, smoothed his feathers, and moved towards the first. Both the  new birds, thereupon, made haste to draw near, and to their  astonishment, heard the following conversation.    \"Good-morning, Madam Long-legs; already, so early, upon the pond?\"    \"Fine thanks, beloved Clatter-beak. I have brought me a little  breakfast. Would you like, perhaps, the quarter of an eider-duck, or a  little frog's thigh?\"    \"My best thanks, but this morning I have little appetite. I come to  the pond for a very different reason. I have to dance to-day before  the guests of my father, and I wish to practise a little in private.\"    Immediately, thereupon, the young lady-stork stepped, in great  excitement, over the plain. The Caliph and Mansor looked on her in  amazement. When, however, she stood in a picturesque attitude upon one  foot, and, at the same time, gracefully moved her wings like a fan,  the two could contain themselves no longer; a loud laugh broke forth  from their bills. The Caliph was the first to recover himself. \"That  were once a joke,\" said he, \"which gold could not have purchased.  Pity! that the stupid birds should have been driven away by our  laughter; otherwise they would certainly even yet have been singing.\"    But already it occurred to the Grand-Vizier that, during their  metamorphosis, laughter was prohibited; he shared his anxiety on this  head with the Caliph. \"By Mecca and Medina! that were a sorry jest, if  I am to remain a stork. Bethink thyself, then, of the foolish word,  for I can recall it not.\"    \"Three times must we bow ourselves to the East, and at the same time  say, Mu--mu--mu--\"    They turned to the East, and bowed so low that their beaks almost  touched the earth. But, O misery! that magic word had escaped them;  and though the Caliph prostrated himself again and again, though at  the same time the Vizier earnestly cried \"Mu--mu--,\" all recollection  thereof had vanished, and poor Chasid and his Vizier were to remain  storks.          CHAPTER III.      The enchanted ones wandered sorrowfully through the fields, not  knowing, in their calamity, what they should first set about. To the  city they could not return, for the purpose of discovering themselves,  for who would have believed a stork that he was the Caliph? or, if he  should find credit, would the inhabitants of Bagdad have been willing  to have such a bird for their master? Thus, for several days, did they  wander around, supporting themselves on the produce of the fields,  which, however, on account of their long bills, they could not readily  pick up. For eider-ducks and frogs they had no appetite, for they  feared with such dainty morsels to ruin their stomachs. In this  pitiable situation their only consolation was that they could fly, and  accordingly they often winged their way to the roofs of Bagdad, to see  what was going on therein.    On the first day they observed great commotion and mourning in the  streets; but on the fourth after their transformation, they lighted by  chance upon the royal palace, from which they saw, in the street  beneath, a splendid procession. Drums and fifes sounded; on a  richly-caparisoned steed was seated a man, in a scarlet mantle  embroidered with gold, surrounded by gorgeously-attired attendants.  Half Bagdad was running after him, crying, \"Hail, Mizra! Lord of  Bagdad!\" All this the two storks beheld from the roof of the palace,  and the Caliph Chasid exclaimed,--    \"Perceivest thou now why I am enchanted, Grand-Vizier? This Mizra is  the son of my deadly enemy, the mighty sorcerer Kaschnur, who, in an  evil hour, vowed revenge against me. Still I do not abandon all hope.  Come with me, thou faithful companion of my misery; we will go to the  grave of the Prophet; perhaps in that holy spot the charm may be  dissolved.\" They raised themselves from the roof of the palace, and  flew in the direction of Medina.    In the use of their wings, however, they experienced some difficulty,  for the two storks had, as yet, but little practice. \"O Sire!\"  groaned out the Vizier, after a couple of hours; \"with your  permission, I can hold out no longer; you fly so rapidly! Besides, it  is already evening, and we would do well to seek a shelter for the  night.\"    Chasid gave ear to the request of his attendant, and thereupon saw, in  the vale beneath, a ruin which appeared to promise safe lodgings; and  thither, accordingly, they flew. The place where they had alighted for  the night, seemed formerly to have been a castle. Gorgeous columns  projected from under the rubbish, and several chambers, which were  still in a state of tolerable preservation, testified to the former  magnificence of the mansion. Chasid and his companion went around  through the corridor, to seek for themselves a dry resting-place;  suddenly the stork Mansor paused. \"Lord and master,\" he whispered  softly, \"were it not foolish for a Grand-Vizier, still more for a  stork, to be alarmed at spectres, my mind is very uncomfortable; for  here, close at hand, sighs and groans are very plainly perceptible.\"  The Caliph now in turn stood still, and quite distinctly heard a low  moaning, which seemed to belong rather to a human being than a beast.  Full of expectation, he essayed to proceed to the place whence the  plaintive sounds issued: but the Vizier, seizing him by the wing with  his beak, entreated him fervently not to plunge them in new and  unknown dangers. In vain! the Caliph, to whom a valiant heart beat  beneath his stork-wing, burst away with the loss of a feather, and  hastened into a gloomy gallery. In a moment he reached a door, which  seemed only on the latch, and out of which he heard distinct sighs,  accompanied by a low moaning. He pushed the door open with his bill,  but stood, chained by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#3)"],[1,"-- Siege of  Acre -- Reverses of the French -- Bonaparte First Consul -- Immense  Military Preparations -- The Reforms of Bonaparte -- The Code Napoleon  -- Bonaparte becomes Emperor of the French -- Meditated Invasion of  England -- Battle of Austerlitz -- Battle of Jena -- Bonaparte  aggrandizes France -- Aggrandizement of Bonaparte's Family -- The  Peninsular War -- Invasion of Russia -- Battle of Smolensko -- Retreat  of the French -- Battles of Lutzen and Bautzen -- Battle of Leipsic --  The Allied Powers invade France -- Peace of Paris -- Bonaparte escapes  from Elba -- Battle of Waterloo -- Reflections on Napoleon's Fall.

CHAPTER I.    STATE OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY IN THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES.      The period at which this History commences,--the beginning of the  sixteenth century,--when compared with the ages which had preceded it,  since the fall of the Roman empire, was one of unprecedented  brilliancy and activity. It was a period very fruitful in great men  and great events, and, though stormy and turbulent, was favorable to  experiments and reforms. The nations of Europe seem to have been  suddenly aroused from a state of torpor and rest, and to have put  forth new energies in every department of life. The material and the  political, the moral and the social condition of society was subject  to powerful agitations, and passed through important changes.    Great _discoveries and inventions_ had been made. The use of movable  types, first ascribed to a German, of Mentz, by the name of Gutenberg,  in 1441, and to Peter Schoeffer, in 1444, changed the whole system of  book-making, and vastly increased the circulation of the Scriptures,  the Greek and Latin classics, and all other valuable works, which, by  the industry of the monkish copyist, had been preserved from the  ravages of time and barbarism. Gunpowder, whose explosive power had  been perceived by Roger Bacon as early as 1280, though it was not used  on the field of battle until 1346, had completely changed the art of  war and had greatly contributed to undermine the feudal system. The  polarity of the magnet, also discovered in the middle ages, and not  practically applied to the mariner's compass until 1403, had led to  the greatest event of the fifteenth century--the discovery of America  by Christopher Columbus, in 1492. The impulse given to commerce by  this and other discoveries of unknown continents and oceans, by the  Portuguese, the Spaniards, the Dutch, the English, and the French,  cannot be here enlarged on. America revealed to the astonished  European her riches in gold and silver; and Indian spices, and silks,  and drugs, were imported, through new channels, into all the countries  inhabited by the Teutonic races. Mercantile wealth, with all its  refinements, acquired new importance in the eyes of the nations. The  world opened towards the east and the west. The horizon of knowledge  extended. Popular delusions were dispelled. Liberality of mind was  acquired. The material prosperity of the western nations was  increased. Tastes became more refined, and social intercourse more  cheerful.    [Sidenote: Revival of the Arts.]    Art, in all its departments, was every where revived at this epoch.  Houses became more comfortable, and churches more splendid. The  utensils of husbandry and of cookery were improved. Linen and woollen  manufactures supplanted the coarser fabrics of the dark ages. Music  became more elaborate, and the present system of notation was adopted.  The genius of the sculptor again gave life and beauty to a marble  block, and painting was carried to greater perfection than by the  ancient Greeks and Romans. Florence, Venice, Milan, and Rome became  seats of various schools of this beautiful art, of which Michael  Angelo, Correggio, the Carracci, and Raphael were the most celebrated  masters, all of whom were distinguished for peculiar excellences,  never since surpassed, or even equalled. The Flemish artists were  scarcely behind the Italian; and Rubens, of Antwerp, may well rank  with Correggio and Titian. To Raphael, however, the world has, as yet,  furnished no parallel.    [Sidenote: Influence of Feudalism.]    _The political and social structure_ of society changed. The crusades,  long before, had given a shock to the political importance of the  feudal aristocracy, and reviving commerce and art had shaken the  system to its foundations. The Flemish weavers had arisen, and a  mercantile class had clamored for new privileges. In the struggle of  classes, and in the misfortunes of nobles, monarchs had perceived the  advantages they might gain, and fortunate circumstances enabled them  to raise absolute thrones, and restore a central power, always so  necessary to the cause of civilization. Feudalism had answered many  useful ends in the dark ages. It had secured a reciprocity of duties  between a lord and his vassal; it had restored loyalty, truth, and  fidelity among semi-barbarians; it had favored the cultivation of the  soil; it had raised up a hardy rural population; it had promoted  chivalry, and had introduced into Europe the modern gentleman; it had  ennobled friendship, and spread the graces of urbanity and gentleness  among rough and turbulent warriors. But it had, also, like all human  institutions, become corrupt, and failed to answer the ends for which  it was instituted. It had become an oppressive social despotism; it  had widened the distinction between the noble and ignoble classes; it  had produced selfishness and arrogance among the nobles, and a mean  and cringing sycophancy among the people; it had perpetuated  privileges, among the aristocracy, exceedingly unjust, and ruinous to  the general welfare of society. It therefore fell before the advancing  spirit of the age, and monarchies and republics were erected on its  ruins. The people, as well as monarchs, had learned the secret of  their power. They learned that, by combining their power, they could  successfully resist their enemies. The principle of association was  learned. Combinations of masses took place. Free cities were  multiplied. A population of artificers, and small merchants, and free  farmers arose. They discussed their privileges, and asserted their  independence. Political liberty was born, and its invaluable blessings  were conceived, if they were not realized.    [Sidenote: Effects of Scholasticism.]    _And the intellectual state_ of Europe received an impulse as marked  and beneficent as the physical and social. The scholastic philosophy,  with its dry and technical logic, its abstruse formulas, and its  subtle refinements, ceased to satisfy the wants of the human mind, now  craving light and absolute knowledge in all departments of science and  philosophy. Like feudalism, it had once been useful; but like that  institution, it had also become corrupted, and an object of sarcasm  and mockery. It had trained the European mind for the discoveries of  the sixteenth century; it had raised up an inquisitive spirit, and had  led to profound reflections on the existence of God, on his attributes  and will, on the nature of the soul, on the faculties of the mind and  on the practical duties of life. But this philosophy became pedantic  and cold; covered, as with a funereal shade, the higher pursuits of  life; and diverted attention from what was practical and useful. That  earnest spirit, which raised up Luther and Bacon, demanded, of the  great masters of thought, something which the people could understand,  and something which would do them good.    In poetry, the insipid and immoral songs of the Provencal bards gave  place to the immortal productions of the great creators of the  European languages. Dante led the way in Italy, and gave to the world  the \"Divine Comedy\"--a masterpiece of human genius, which raised him  to the rank of Homer and Virgil. Petrarch followed in his steps, and,  if not as profound or original as Dante, yet is unequalled as an  \"enthusiastic songster of ideal love.\" He also gave a great impulse to  civilization by his labors in collecting and collating manuscripts.  Boccaccio also lent his aid in the revival of literature, and wrote a  series of witty, though objectionable stories, from which the English  Chaucer borrowed the notion of his \"Canterbury Tales.\" Chaucer is the  father of English poetry, and kindled a love of literature among his  isolated countrymen; and was one of the few men who, in the evening of  his days, looked upon the world without austerity, and expressed  himself with all the vivacity of youthful feeling.    [Sidenote: Ecclesiastical Corruptions.]    Such were some of the leading events and circumstances which gave a  new life to European society, and created a desire for better days.  All of these causes of improvement acted and reacted on each other in  various ways, and prepared the way to new and great developments of  action and passion. These new energies were, however, unfortunately  checked by a combination of evils which had arisen in the dark ages,  and which required to be subverted before any great progress could be  reasonably expected. These evils were most remarkable in the church  itself and almost extinguished the light which"]]]
