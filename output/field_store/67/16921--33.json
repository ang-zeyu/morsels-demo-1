No one would know until the transport ship landed on that other  world which appeared on the direction tape symbolized by a jewellike  disk of gold-brown which had given it the code name of Topaz.          2      There were an even dozen of the air-borne guardians, each following the  swing of its own orbital path just within the atmospheric envelope of  the planet which glowed as a great bronze-golden gem in the four-world  system of a yellow star. The globes had been launched to form a web of  protection around Topaz six months earlier, and the highest skill had  gone into their production. Just as contact mines sown in a harbor could  close that landfall to ships not knowing the secret channel, so was this  world supposedly closed to any spaceship not equipped with the signal to  ward off the sphere missiles.    That was the theory of the new off-world settlers whose protection they  were to be, already tested as well as possible, but as yet not put to  the ultimate proof. The small bright globes spun undisturbed across a  two-mooned sky at night and made reassuring blips on an installation  screen by day.    Then a thirteenth object winked into being, began the encircling,  closing spiral of descent. A sphere resembling the warden-globes, it was  a hundred times their size, and its orbit was purposefully controlled  by instruments under the eye and hand of a human pilot.    Four men were strapped down on cushioned sling-seats in the control  cabin of the Western Alliance ship, two hanging where their fingers  might reach buttons and levers, the others merely passengers, their own  labor waiting for the time when they would set down on the alien soil of  Topaz. The planet hung there in their visa-screen, richly beautiful in  its amber gold, growing larger, nearer, so that they could pick out  features of seas, continents, mountain ranges, which had been studied on  tape until they were familiar, yet now were strangely unfamiliar too.    One of the warden-globes alerted, oscillated in its set path, whirled  faster as its delicate interior mechanisms responded to the awakening  spark which would send it on its mission of destruction. A relay  clicked, but for the smallest fraction of a millimeter failed to set the  proper course. On the instrument, far below, which checked the globe's  new course the mistake was not noted.    The screen of the ship spiraling toward Topaz registered a path which  would bring it into violent contact with the globe. They were still some  hundreds of miles apart when the alarm rang. The pilot's hand clawed out  at the bank of controls; under the almost intolerable pressure of their  descent, there was so little he could do. His crooked fingers fell back  powerlessly from the buttons and levers; his mouth was a twisted grimace  of bleak acceptance as the beat of the signal increased.    One of the passengers forced his head around on the padded rest, fought  to form words, to speak to his companion. The other was staring ahead at  the screen, his thick lips wide and flat against his teeth in a snarl  of rage.    \"They ... are ... here....\"    Ruthven paid no attention to the obvious as stated by his fellow  scientist. His fury was a red, pulsing thing inside him, fed by his own  helplessness. To be pinned here so near his goal, fastened up as a  target for an inanimate but cunningly fashioned weapon, ate into him  like a stream of deadly acid. His big gamble would puff out in a blast  of fire to light up Topaz's sky, with nothing left--nothing. On the  armrest of his sling-seat his nails scratched deep.    The four men in the control cabin could only sit and watch, waiting for  the rendezvous which would blot them out. Ruthven's flaming anger was a  futile blaze. His companion in the passenger seat had closed his eyes,  his lips moving soundlessly in an expression of his own scattered  thoughts. The pilot and his assistant divided their attention between  the screen, with its appalling message, and the controls they could not  effectively use, feverishly seeking a way out in these last moments.    Below them in the bowl of the ship were those who would not know the end  consciously--save in one compartment. In a padded cage a prick-eared  head stirred where it rested on forepaws, slitted eyes blinked, aware  not only of familiar surroundings, but also of the tension and fear  generated by human minds and emotions levels above. A pointed nose  raised, and there was a growling deep in a throat covered with thick  buff-gray hair.    The growl aroused another similar captive. Knowing yellow eyes met  yellow eyes. An intelligence, which was certainly not that of the animal  body which contained it, fought down instinct raging to send both those  bodies hurtling at the fastenings of the twin cages. Curiosity and the  ability to adapt had been bred into both from time immemorial. Then  something else had been added to sly and cunning brains. A step up had  been taken--to weld intelligence to cunning, connect thought to  instinct.    More than a generation earlier mankind had chosen barren desert--the  \"white sands\" of New Mexico--as a testing ground for atomic experiments.  Humankind could be barred, warded out of the radiation limits; the  natural desert dwellers, four-footed and winged, could not be so  controlled.    For thousands of years, since the first southward roving Amerindian  tribes had met with their kind, there had been a hunter of the open  country, a smaller cousin of the wolf, whose natural abilities had made  an undeniable impression on the human mind. He was in countless Indian  legends as the Shaper or the Trickster, sometimes friend, sometimes  enemy. Godling for some tribes, father of all evil for others. In the  wealth of tales the coyote, above all other animals, had a firm place.    Driven by the press of civilization into the badlands and deserts,  fought with poison, gun, and trap, the coyote had survived, adapting to  new ways with all his legendary cunning. Those who had reviled him as  vermin had unwillingly added to the folklore which surrounded him,  telling their own tales of robbed traps, skillful escapes. He continued  to be a trickster, laughing on moonlit nights from the tops of ridges at  those who would hunt him down.    Then, close to the end of the twentieth century, when myths were  scoffed at, the stories of the coyote's slyness began once more on a  fantastic scale. And finally scientists were sufficiently intrigued to  seek out this creature that seemed to display in truth all the abilities  credited to his immortal namesake by pre-Columbian tribes.    What they discovered was indeed shattering to certain closed minds. For  the coyote had not only adapted to the country of the white sands; he  had evolved into something which could not be dismissed as an animal,  clever and cunning, but limited to beast range. Six cubs had been  brought back on the first expedition, coyote in body, their developing  minds different. The grandchildren of those cubs were now in the ship's  cages, their mutated senses alert, ready for the slightest chance of  escape. Sent to Topaz as eyes and ears for less keenly endowed humans,  they were not completely under the domination of man. The range of their  mental powers was still uncomprehended by those who had bred, trained,  and worked with them from the days their eyes had opened and they had  taken their first wobbly steps away from their dams.    The male growled again, his lips wrinkling back in a snarl as the  emanations of fear from the men he could not see reached panic peak. He  still crouched, belly flat, on the protecting pads of his cage; but he  strove now to wriggle closer to the door, just as his mate made the same  effort.    Between the animals and those in the control cabin lay the others--forty  of them. Their bodies were cushioned and protected with every ingenious  device known to those who had placed them there so many weeks earlier.  Their minds were free of the ship, roving into places where men had not  trod before, a territory potentially more dangerous than any solid earth  could ever be.    Operation Retrograde had returned men bodily into the past, sending  agents to hunt mammoths, follow the roads of the Bronze Age traders,  ride with Attila and Genghis Khan, pull bows among the archers of  ancient Egypt. But Redax returned men in mind to the paths of their  ancestors, or this was the theory. And those who slept here and now in  their narrow boxes, lay under its government, while the men who had  arbitrarily set them so could only assume they were actually reliving  the lives of Apache nomads in the wide southwestern wastes of the late  eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.    Above, the pilot's hand pushed out again, fighting the pressure to reach  one particular button. That, too, had been a last-minute addition, an  experiment which had only had partial testing. To use it was the final  move he could make, and he was already half convinced of its  uselessness.    With no faith and only a very wan hope, he sent that round of metal  flush with the board. What followed no one ever lived to explain.    On the planet the installation which tracked the missiles flashed on a  screen bright enough to blind momentarily the duty man on watch, and its  tracker was shaken off course. When it jiggled back into line it was no  longer the efficient eye-in-the-sky it had been, though its tenders were  not to realize that for an important minute or two.    While the ship, now out of control, sped in dizzy whirls toward Topaz,  engines fought blindly to stabilize, to re-establish their functions.  Some succeeded, some wobbled in and out of the danger zone, two failed.  And in the control cabin three dead men spun in prisoning seats.

I pray you, good shepherds, tell me where they may be  found?\"    Here the great Setchene arose and went over to the youngest of the  months, and placing his wand in his hand, said:    \"Brother Brezene (March), do thou take the highest place.\"    Brezene obeyed, at the same time waving his wand over the fire.  Immediately the flames rose towards the sky, the snow began to melt  and the trees and shrubs to bud; the grass became green, and from  between its blades peeped the pale primrose. It was Spring, and the  meadows were blue with violets.    \"Gather them quickly, Marouckla,\" said Brezene.    Joyfully she hastened to pick the flowers, and having soon a large  bunch she thanked them and ran home. Helen and the stepmother were  amazed at the sight of the flowers, the scent of which filled the  house.    \"Where did you find them?\" asked Helen.    \"Under the trees on the mountain slope,\" said Marouckla.    Helen kept the flowers for herself and her mother; she did not even  thank her step-sister for the trouble she had taken. The next day she  desired Marouckla to fetch her strawberries.    \"Run,\" said she, \"and fetch me strawberries from the mountain: they  must be very sweet and ripe.\"    \"But who ever heard of strawberries ripening in the snow?\" exclaimed  Marouckla.    \"Hold your tongue, worm; don't answer me; if I don't have my  strawberries I will kill you.\"    Then the stepmother pushed her into the yard and bolted the door. The  unhappy girl made her way towards the mountain and to the large fire  round which sat the twelve months. The great Setchene occupied the  highest place.    \"Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The winter cold chills  me,\" said she, drawing near.    The great Setchene raised his head and asked:    \"Why comest thou here? What dost thou seek?\"    \"I am looking for strawberries,\" said she.    \"We are in the midst of winter,\" replied Setchene; \"strawberries do  not grow in the snow.\"    \"I know,\" said the girl sadly, \"but my sister and stepmother have  ordered me to bring them strawberries; if I do not they will kill me.  Pray, good shepherds, tell me where to find them.\"    The great Setchene arose, crossed over to the month opposite him, and  putting the wand into his hand, said:    \"Brother Tchervene (June), do thou take the highest place.\"    Tchervene obeyed, and as he waved his wand over the fire the flames  leapt towards the sky. Instantly the snow melted, the earth was  covered with verdure, trees were clothed with leaves, birds began to  sing, and various flowers blossomed in the forest. It was summer.  Under the bushes masses of star-shaped flowers changed into ripening  strawberries. Before Marouckla had time to cross herself they covered  the glade, making it look like a sea of blood.    \"Gather them quickly, Marouckla,\" said Tchervene.    Joyfully she thanked the months, and having filled her apron ran  happily home. Helen and her mother wondered at seeing the  strawberries, which filled the house with their delicious fragrance.    \"Wherever did you find them?\" asked Helen crossly.    \"Right up among the mountains; those from under the beech trees are  not bad.\"    Helen gave a few to her mother and ate the rest herself; not one did  she offer to her step-sister. Being tired of strawberries, on the  third day she took a fancy for some fresh red apples.    \"Run, Marouckla,\" said she, \"and fetch me fresh red apples from the  mountain.\"    \"Apples in winter, sister? why, the trees have neither leaves nor  fruit.\"    \"Idle slut, go this minute,\" said Helen; \"unless you bring back apples  we will kill you.\"    As before, the stepmother seized her roughly and turned her out of the  house. The poor girl went weeping up the mountain, across the deep  snow upon which lay no human footprint, and on towards the fire round  which were the twelve months. Motionless sat they, and on the highest  stone was the great Setchene.    \"Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The winter cold chills  me,\" said she, drawing near.    The great Setchene raised his head.    \"Why com'st thou here? What dost thou seek?\" asked he.    \"I am come to look for red apples,\" replied Marouckla.    \"But this is winter, and not the season for red apples,\" observed the  great Setchene.    [Illustration]    \"I know,\" answered the girl, \"but my sister and stepmother sent me to  fetch red apples from the mountain; if I return without them they will  kill me.\"    Thereupon the great Setchene arose and went over to one of the elderly  months, to whom he handed the wand, saying:    \"Brother Zare (September), do thou take the highest place.\"    Zare moved to the highest stone and waved his wand over the fire.  There was a flare of red flames, the snow disappeared, but the fading  leaves which trembled on the trees were sent by a cold north-east wind  in yellow masses to the glade. Only a few flowers of autumn were  visible, such as the fleabane and red gillyflower, autumn colchicums  in the ravine, and under the beeches bracken and tufts of northern  heather. At first Marouckla looked in vain for red apples. Then she  espied a tree which grew at a great height, and from the branches of  this hung the bright red fruit. Zare ordered her to gather some  quickly. The girl was delighted and shook the tree. First one apple  fell, then another.    \"That is enough,\" said Zare, \"hurry home.\"    Thanking the months, she returned joyfully. Helen marvelled and the  stepmother wondered at seeing the fruit.    \"Where did you gather them?\" asked the step-sister.    \"There are more on the mountain top,\" answered Marouckla.    \"Then why did you not bring more?\" said Helen angrily; \"you must have  eaten them on your way back, you wicked girl.\"    \"No, dear sister, I have not even tasted them,\" said Marouckla. \"I  shook the tree twice; one apple fell each time. I was not allowed to  shake it again, but was told to return home.\"    \"May Perum smite you with his thunderbolt,\" said Helen, striking her.    Marouckla prayed to die rather than suffer such ill-treatment. Weeping  bitterly, she took refuge in the kitchen. Helen and her mother found  the apples more delicious than any they had ever tasted, and when they  had eaten both longed for more.    \"Listen, mother,\" said Helen. \"Give me my cloak; I will fetch some  more apples myself, or else that good-for-nothing wretch will eat them  all on the way. I shall be able to find the mountain and the tree. The  shepherds may cry 'Stop,' but I shall not leave go till I have shaken  down all the apples.\"    In spite of her mother's advice she put on her pelisse, covered her  head with a warm hood, and took the road to the mountain. The mother  stood and watched her till she was lost in the distance.    Snow covered everything, not a human footprint was to be seen on its  surface. Helen lost herself and wandered hither and thither. After a  while she saw a light above her, and following in its direction  reached the mountain top. There was the flaming fire, the twelve  blocks of stone, and the twelve months. At first she was frightened  and hesitated; then she came nearer and warmed her hands. She did not  ask permission, nor did she speak one polite word.    \"What has brought thee here? What dost thou seek?\" said the great  Setchene severely.    \"I am not obliged to tell you, old greybeard; what business is it of  yours?\" she replied disdainfully, turning her back on the fire and  going towards the forest.    The great Setchene frowned, and waved his wand over his head.  Instantly the sky became covered with clouds, the fire went down, snow  fell in large flakes, an icy wind howled round the mountain. Amid the  fury of the storm Helen added curses against her step-sister. The  pelisse failed to warm her benumbed limbs. The mother kept on waiting  for her; she looked from the window, she watched from the doorstep,  but her daughter came not. The hours passed slowly, but Helen did not  return.    \"Can it be that the apples have charmed her from her home?\" thought  the mother. Then she clad herself in hood and pelisse and went in  search of her daughter. Snow fell in huge masses; it covered all  things, it lay untouched by human footsteps. For long she wandered  hither and thither; the icy north-east wind whistled in the mountain,  but no voice answered her cries.    Day after day Marouckla worked and prayed, and waited; but neither  stepmother nor sister returned, they had been frozen to death on the  mountain. The inheritance of a small house, a field, and a cow fell to  Marouckla. In course of time an honest farmer came to share them with  her, and their lives were happy and peaceful.          THE SUN OR THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS OF THE OLD MAN VSEVEDE            [Illustration]    THE SUN; OR, THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS OF THE OLD MAN VSEVEDE      Can this be a true story? It is said that once there was a king who  was exceedingly fond of hunting the wild beasts in his forests. One  day he followed a stag so far and so long that he lost his way. Alone  and overtaken by night, he was glad to find himself near a small  thatched cottage in which lived a charcoal-burner.    \"Will you kindly show me the way to the high-road? You shall be  handsomely rewarded.\"    \"I would willingly,\" said the charcoal-burner, \"but God is going to  send my wife a little child, and I cannot leave her alone. Will you  pass the night under our roof? There is a truss of sweet hay in the  loft where you may rest, and to-morrow morning I will be your guide.\"    The king accepted the invitation and went to bed in the loft. Shortly  after a son was born to the charcoal-burner's wife. But the king could  not sleep. At midnight he heard noises in the house, and looking "]]]
