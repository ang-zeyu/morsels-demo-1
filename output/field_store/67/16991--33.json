Passing what must appear to human comprehension as vague (an attempt  at the contemplation of which would be without profit in this  connection), and what has been called the \"music of the spheres,\"[3]  we may proceed to briefly touch upon those forms of natural music  which are ever within our hearing, and which constantly afford us  pleasure.    [Footnote 3: Reference is supposed to be made to this in the Book of  Job, in these words: \"When the morning stars sang together, and all  the sons of God shouted for joy.\"]    First let us go forth into the summer woods. The eye takes in the  charming prospect,--the trees dressed in beautiful green; the \"grassy  carpet,\" parted ever and anon by a gliding, gurgling brooklet; the  wild flower peeping up near the feet; a landscape of even surface, or  at times pleasingly undulated. The atmosphere is freighted with a  delightful fragrance; and from rustling bough, from warbling bird,  from rippling brook, and from the joyous hum of insects almost  innumerable,         \"The air is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs,       That give delight, and hurt not.\"    All these, the beauties of animate and inanimate Nature, pleasantly  affect the senses. But the chief influence there--the crowning glory  of the groves--is the songs, the charming music of the birds, as they  warble from tree to tree, untrammelled by the forms of art, their  sweetest melodies. How often do their lightsome, inspiriting  carollings ring out upon the morning air, persuasively calling us from  our couches to listen in delight to Nature's minstrelsy! \"After man,\"  says a writer, \"the birds occupy the highest rank in Nature's  concerts. They make the woods, the gardens, and the fields resound  with their merry warbles. Their warbled 'shake' has never been  equalled by human gifts of voice, nor by art.\"    Indeed, it has been found that many of the songs of birds are sung in  certain of the keys; while a learned musical writer has produced a  book in which are printed many samples of the music often sung by  birds. In very recent times it is stated, too, that birds have been  taught to sing some of the popular tunes of the day; this being  accomplished by placing a bird in a room for a while, allowing it to  hear no other bird, and only the tune to be learned. Professor Brown  of Aiken, S.C., has mocking-birds which he has taught to sing such  songs as \"The Star-spangled Banner\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\" These birds  were to be taken to the Centennial Exhibition, to there exhibit their  marvellous skill.    A writer in \"The Monthly Reader\" thus speaks of that pretty singer the  bullfinch:--         \"I heard a lady cry out to a little bird in a cage, 'Come,       Bully, Bully, sweet little Bully Bullfinch, please give us       just one more tune.'         \"And then, to my surprise, the little bird whistled the tune       of 'Yankee Doodle' as well as I could have done it myself.         \"The lady then told me about the bird. It was a bullfinch.       She had bought it in the little town of Fulda, in Germany,       where there are schools for teaching these birds to sing.         \"When a bullfinch has learned to sing two or three tunes, he       is worth from forty to sixty dollars; for he will bring that       price in London or Boston or New York.         \"To teach them, the birds are put in classes of about six       each, and kept for a time in a dark room. Here, when their       food is given them, they are made to hear music. And so,       when they have had their food, or when they want more food,       they will sing, and try to sing a tune like that they have       just heard; for perhaps they think it has something to do       with what they eat.\"    But as, in presenting these examples of the musical teachableness of  the \"feathered songsters,\" I am entering the domain of music as an  art, I will not further digress. Certain it is, too, that these  delightful musicians of Nature do not require the aid of the skill of  man; nor is it desirable, for the sake of musical effect at least,  that their own wild, free, and glad-hearted warblings should be  changed. They are better as they are, affording as they do a pleasing  contrast, and adding freshness and variety to the many other forms of  music. Some one, dwelling upon the charming beauty of bird-music, has  expressed in words of very excusable rapture the following unique  wish:--         \"Oh! had I but the power         To set the proper words       To all your glorious melodies,         My sweet-voiced birds,         When words and dainty music         Would each to each belong,       Together we might give the world         A _perfect_ song.\"    But I need not refer at greater length to these sweet harmonists of  Nature, since scarce an ear is so dull, and few hearts are so cold, as  not to be charmed and cheered by their unceasing, joyous melodies.    It might well be thought that flowers, those \"fairy ministers of  grace,\" with their delicately tinted, variegated, perfect hues, that  emit, in their sweet, delicious perfumes, what may be called the  \"breath of heaven,\" possess in these delightful qualities full enough  to instruct and charm mankind. But there is a flower, it seems, that,  inviting the aid of the evening zephyr, adds sweet music to its other  fascinating beauties. Let the poet Twombly sing of the music-giving--         BLUE HAREBELL.         Have ye ever heard in the twilight dim             A low, soft strain       That ye fancied a distant vesper-hymn,             Borne o'er the plain       By the zephyrs that rise on perfumed wing,       When the sun's last glances are glimmering?         Have ye heard that music, with cadence sweet             And merry peal,       Ring out like the echoes of fairy feet             O'er flowers that steal?         The source of that whispering strain I'll tell;             For I have listened oft       To the music faint of the blue harebell             In the gloaming soft:       'Tis the gay fairy-folk the peal who ring,       At even-time, for their banqueting.         And gayly the trembling bells peal out             With gentle tongue;       While elves and fairies career about             'Mid dance and song.    It would be tedious to enumerate and dwell upon all the very numerous  music-making agencies of the natural world; and I shall therefore  allude only to a few of those not already mentioned.    Many have heard the sounds of waterfalls, and know that from them  issues a kind of majestic music, which, to be appreciated, must be  heard. Musicians of finely-cultivated ears have studied the tones of  waterfalls; and two of them, Messrs. A. and E. Heim, say that a mass  of falling water gives         \"The chord of C sharp, and also the non-accordant F. When C       and D sound louder than the middle note, F is heard very       fully, as a deep, dull, humming, far-resounding tone, with       a strength proportionate to the mass of the falling water.       It easily penetrates to a distance at which the other notes       are inaudible. The notes C, E, G, F, belong to all rushing       water, and in great falls are sometimes in different       octaves. Small falls give the same notes one or two octaves       higher. In the stronger falls, F is heard the most easily;       in the weak ones, C. At the first attempt, C is most readily       detected. Persons with musical cultivation, on attempting to       sing near rapidly-moving water, naturally use the key of C       sharp, or of F sharp if near a great fall.\"    Somewhat similar to waterfalls in the character of the tunes they  produce (being distinguished, however, generally, by a greater  softness and more gentle flow) are the waves, that, handsome in form,  roll majestically shoreward, greeting the ear with a strange,  dirge-like, yet, as it seems to the writer, pleasing harmony.    Here is given a duet between the waves and zephyrs:--         \"We sit beneath the dreaming moon,         And gaze upon the sea:       Our hearts with Nature are in tune;         List to her minstrelsy.       The waves chant low and soft their song,         And kiss the rocks in glee;       While zephyrs their sweet lay prolong,--         Their love-song to the sea.\"    There is a pretty, delicate music made by the rippling, gurgling  brooklet, as its transparent waters glide over its pebbly bottom. And  there's the musical sea-shell. Place it to the ear, and you shall  catch, as if in the far distance, the reverberating roll of the  billowy ocean as it sings a mighty song. To this the poet Wordsworth  very gracefully refers in the following lines:--                               \"I have seen       A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract       Of inland ground, applying to his ear       The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell:       To which, in silence hushed, his very soul       Listened intensely, and his countenance soon       Brightened with joy; for from within were heard       Murmurings whereby the monitor expressed       Mysterious union with its native sea.\"    And an anonymous writer (it does not seem that he had good cause for  hiding his name) thus discourses on the music of the sea:--         \"The gray, unresting sea,         Adown the bright and belting shore       Breaking in untold melody,         Makes music evermore.         Centuries of vanished time,         Since this glad earth's primeval morn,       Have heard the grand, unpausing chime,         Momently new born.         Like as in cloistered piles         Rich bursts of massive sounds upswell,       Ringing along dim-lighted aisles         With spirit-trancing spell;         So on the surf-white strand         Chants of deep peal the sea-waves raise,       Like voices "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#3)"],[1," OVER THE MOAT, CROWHURST PLACE                          412        TANDRIDGE CHURCH                                                   415        A STREET IN OXTED                                                  417        OXTED CHURCH                                                       418        THE GOLF HOUSE AND WINDMILL, WIMBLEDON COMMON                      429            HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS    IN    SURREY          CHAPTER I    THE PILGRIMS' WAY        The Pageant of the Road.--Canterbury Pilgrims.--Henry II.      barefoot.--Choosing the Road.--Wind on the Hill.--Wine in the      Valley.--_Pilgrim's Progress._--Shalford Fair.--A doubtful      Mile.--Trespassers will be Prosecuted.--With Chaucer from the      Tabard.      East and west through the county of Surrey runs the chalk ridge of the  North Downs, the great highway of Southern England from the Straits of  Dover to Salisbury Plain. Of all English roads, it has carried the  longest pageant. It saw the beginnings of English history; for four  centuries it was one of the best known highways in Christendom: the  vision from its windy heights is one of the widest and most gracious of  all visions of woods and fields and hills. By the trackway they made  upon the ridge came the worshippers to Stonehenge; Phoenician traders  brought bronze to barter for British tin, and the tin was carried in  ingots from Devon and Cornwall along the highway to the port of Thanet;  Greeks and Gauls came for lead and tin and furs, and the merchants rode  by the great Way to bring them. When Caesar swept through Surrey on his  second landing, his legions marched over the Way before he turned north  to the Thames. When the Conqueror drove fire and sword through Southern  England, he went down to Winchester by the chalk ridge; and when the  great lords under the Conqueror and Rufus, Richard de Tonebrige and  William de Warenne, built their rival castles, they built them to  command the highway; so did Henry of Blois build his castle at Farnham;  and so was Guildford Castle built. Of warfare later than Norman days,  the Way saw nearly all that went through Surrey. Simon de Montfort and  his barons rode fast by the ridge the year before Lewes; they lay at  Reading on the twenty-ninth of June, and on the first of July at  Reigate. In the wars of the Parliament, Farnham west of the Way saw the  siege of an hour; Lord Holland led his little band from Dorking to  Reigate and fled back again. Last of the echoes of Stuart battles,  Monmouth, after Sedgmoor, was driven through Farnham to lodge for one  night of misery and fear at Abbot's Hospital in Guildford.    But the Way has another meaning and other memories. It is as the  Pilgrims' Way that it is best known, and as the Pilgrims' Way that it  has been written about and tracked and traced and surrounded with legend  and story and the haunting melancholy of an old road once used and now  half forgotten. The Pilgrims' Way is more than the old Way, for it runs  by more than one road. The old Way took its followers along the ridge or  just under it, high in the sun and wind where the traders and fighters  could see their route clear above the thick woods of the Weald. The  Pilgrims' Way lies as often on the low ground as on the hill. But it  follows the line of the chalk ridge, and the parallel roads, though here  and there it would be difficult to choose between them as to which was  most used by travellers, have become vaguely named the Pilgrims' Way,  and as the Pilgrims' Way they remain.    [Illustration: _Along the Chalk Ridge.--Leith Hill in the Distance._]    The Way became the Pilgrims' Way in 1174, four years after Thomas a  Becket was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral. His tomb in the Cathedral  became the second shrine in Christendom, and pilgrims came to it along  the old trackway through Surrey, from Farnham east of the Hog's Back  along the hills to Canterbury in Kent. Henry the Second, one of the  earliest pilgrims of all, made his act of repentance a few days after  landing at Southampton from France, on February 8, 1174. Or so legend  relates, and adds that he swore to walk barefoot; history is less  precise. After Henry the stream of devotees multiplied. Pilgrims  landed, like Henry, at Southampton, or between Southampton and  Chichester, and came through Winchester or Alton to Farnham; travellers  from the West of England joined the foreigners at Winchester, or came to  Farnham by the old Harrow Way, another ancient track from Salisbury  Plain. Thousands made the journey; more and more followed year by year.  At last it was determined to divide the stream. St. Thomas was murdered  on December 29, and the great pilgrimage to Canterbury and the return  centred round that date. In 1220 pilgrims were given a chance of paying  their vows in summer as well as winter. St. Thomas's body, on July 7,  was moved from the crypt under the nave to the grand altar in the nave,  and from that day forward the Feast of the Translation took its share of  the pilgrims' numbers. A constant stream journeyed east and west;  travellers with vows unpaid met travellers returning from the shrine,  and on and round the peopled highway sprang up booths and shelters to  meet the pilgrim's needs. Pedlars and merchants hawked their wares and  drove bargains by the road. Fairs were instituted in the villages along  the route; strolling musicians earned idle wages; beggars sat by the  roadside, at the churchyard corners, at the foot of the hills, and asked  for alms.    [Illustration: _The \"Hog's Back.\"_]    And here, before we follow the pilgrims across the county from Farnham  to the lane by which they leave it east of Titsey, I want to make a  point clear. The pilgrims did not all travel to Canterbury by the same  road, along the selfsame track so many feet wide, as the Ordnance map  and some of those who have written on the Pilgrims' Way would argue.  There is not one single, separate path along which every pilgrim who set  out from Winchester to Canterbury travelled through Surrey. All that the  pilgrims did was to journey forward either on, or near, the old Way from  west to east and east to west, and it has happened that they used, more  than any other track besides the Way itself, one particular road. This  road can be followed parallel to the old Way for a long distance,  running from church to church under the chalk ridge; and it is this road  which is marked in the maps as the Pilgrims' Way. Perhaps that is  convenient, but it should be understood that not all the pilgrims went  by it. For pilgrims, after all, were as human then as walkers along  country roads are to-day. They would not all want to do the same thing  in the same way. Some of them would set out to do one thing and some  another. Some would prefer to walk alone high up on the ridge; others  would choose a bevy of companions and chatter along the road under the  hill. Some would be thin, ascetic persons, who liked to stride along and  see how far they could go without eating or drinking; some would be  pleasant, good-tempered creatures, who would amble by dusty places and  be thankful for cool beer; some would eat or drink mechanically, filled  with a single thought of prayer and pilgrimage to a shrine. Some would  be always perverse, and because most people travelled by one path, or  halted at an easy spot, would choose deliberately another path, and halt  where others passed on. Some would determine, come what might of wind or  rain or sun, to sleep at a certain village at nightfall; others would  let the weather decide for them. The weather would decide much, and it  would choose differently for different travellers. One of the writers  who has discussed the problems of the Pilgrims' Way suggests that the  main route would vary with varying degrees of heat and cold. If the  weather were cold and wet, the pilgrims would travel on the chalk ridge;  and if it were hot, they would go by the leafy woodland path below. But  if I Were a pilgrim and the weather were hot, I should go by the top of  the ridge, so as to get the air and the view; probably I would go by the  ridge in any case, whatever the weather was.    If written proof were needed that the journeying pilgrims Were not  condemned to a sort of solemn observance of the rules of  \"Follow-my-leader,\" or bound by uncomfortable routine like so many  Cook's tourists, it would not be difficult to find. From a paper on the  Pilgrims' Way, written by Major-General E. Renouard James, you may learn  that in 1463, nearly three hundred years after the first pilgrim  followed Henry II to Canterbury, St. Martha's chapel by Guildford--St.  Martha's being a corruption of \"The Martyr's,\" that is, St. Thomas the  Martyr's chapel--was in need of repair. And so, through the Prior of  Newark, \"forty days' indulgence was granted to such as should resort to  this chapel on account of devotion, prayer, pilgrimage, or offering; and  should there say Paternoster, the Angel's Salutation, and the Apostles'  Creed; or should contribute, bequeath, or otherwise assign anything  towards the maintenance, repair, or rebuilding of the same.\" But what  does that mean? It must mean that not all the pilgrims went into St.  Martha's to pray, or even went by St. Martha's on their way east. The  Prior specially framed the terms of his indulgence to attract more  pilgrims.    In Mr. Hilaire Belloc's admirably interesting book _The Old Road_, in  which he describes the way in which he, sometimes with one companion and  sometimes with two, sought out the exact track of a single Pilgrims' Way  from Winchester to Canterbury, I find him writing of the compulsions of  the pilgrimage--\"The pilgrim set out from Winchester: 'You must pass by  that well,' he heard, 'it is sacred.' ... 'You must, of ritual, climb  that isolated hill which you see against the sky. The spirits haunted it  and were banished by the faith, and they say that martyrs died there.'  ... 'It "]]]
