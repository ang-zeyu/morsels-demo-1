Apotheosis of Hou Chi.--And so he grew to man's estate, and taught  the people husbandry, with a success that has never been rivalled.  Consequently, he was deified, and during several centuries of the Chou  dynasty was united in worship with God:--         O wise Hou Chi,       Fit Associate of our God,       Founder of our race,       There is none greater than thou!       Thou gavest us wheat and barley,       Which God appointed for our nourishment,       And without distinction of territory,       Didst inculcate the virtues over our vast dominions.    Other Deities.--During the long period covered by the Chou dynasty,  various other deities, of more or less importance, were called into  existence.    The patriarchal Emperor Shen Nung, B.C. 2838-2698, who had taught his  people to till the ground and eat of the fruits of their labour, was  deified as the tutelary genius of agriculture:--         That my fields are in such good condition       Is matter of joy to my husbandmen.       With lutes, and with drums beating,       We will invoke the Father of Husbandry,       And pray for sweet rain,       To increase the produce of our millet fields,       And to bless my men and their wives.    There were also sacrifices to the Father of War, whoever he may have  been; to the Spirits of Wind, Rain, and Fire; and even to a deity who  watched over the welfare of silkworms. Since those days, the number of  spiritual beings who receive worship from the Chinese, some in one part  of the empire, some in another, has increased enormously. A single  work, published in 1640, gives notices of no fewer than eight hundred  divinities.    Superstitions.--During the period under consideration, all kinds of  superstition prevailed; among others, that of referring to the rainbow.  The rainbow was believed by the vulgar to be an emanation from an  enormous oyster away in the great ocean which surrounded the world, i.e.  China. Philosophers held it to be the result of undue proportions in the  mixture of the two cosmogonical principles which when properly blended  produce the harmony of nature. By both parties it was considered to be  an inauspicious manifestation, and merely to point at it would produce a  sore on the hand.    Supernatural Manifestations.--Several events of a supernatural character  are recorded as having taken place under the Chou dynasty. In B.C. 756,  one of the feudal Dukes saw a vision of a yellow serpent which descended  from heaven and laid its head on the slope of a mountain. The Duke spoke  of this to his astrologer, who said, \"It is a manifestation of God;  sacrifice to it.\"    In B.C. 747, another Duke found on a mountain a being in the semblance  of a stone. Sacrifices were at once offered, and the stone was deified,  and received regular worship from that time forward.    In B.C. 659, a third Duke was in a trance for five days, when he saw  a vision of God, and received from Him instructions as to matters then  pressing. For many generations afterwards the story ran that the Duke  had been up to Heaven. This became a favourite theme for romancers. It  is stated in the biography of a certain Feng Po that \"one night he saw  the gate of heaven open, and beheld exceeding glory within, which shone  into his courtyard.\"    The following story is told by Huai-nan Tzu (d. B.C. 122):--\"Once when  the Duke of Lu-yang was at war with the Han State, and sunset drew near  while a battle was still fiercely raging, the Duke held up his spear and  shook it at the sun, which forthwith went back three zodiacal signs.\"    Only the Emperor worships God and Earth.--From the records of this  period we can also see how jealously the worship of God and Earth was  reserved for the Emperor alone.    In B.C. 651, Duke Huan of the Ch'i State, one of the feudal nobles to  be mentioned later on, wished to signalise his accession to the post of  doyen or leader of the vassal States by offering the great sacrifices  to God and to Earth. He was, however, dissuaded from this by a wise  Minister, who pointed out that only those could perform these ceremonies  who had personally received the Imperial mandate from God.    This same Minister is said to be responsible for the following  utterance:--    \"Duke Huan asked Kuan Chang, saying, To what should a prince attach the  highest importance? To God, replied the Minister; at which Duke Huan  gazed upwards to the sky. The God I mean, continued Kuan Chung, is not  the illimitable blue above. A true prince makes the people his God.\"    Sacrifices.--Much has been recorded by the Chinese on the subject  of sacrifice,--more indeed than can be easily condensed into a small  compass. First of all, there were the great sacrifices to God and to  Earth, at the winter and summer solstices respectively, which were  reserved for the Son of Heaven alone. Besides what may be called private  sacrifices, the Emperor sacrificed also to the four quarters, and to the  mountains and rivers of the empire; while the feudal nobles sacrificed  each to his own quarter, and to the mountains and rivers of his own  domain. The victim offered by the Emperor on a blazing pile of wood was  an ox of one colour, always a young animal; a feudal noble would use any  fatted ox; and a petty official a sheep or a pig. When sacrificing to  the spirits of the land and of grain, the Son of Heaven used a bull, a  ram, and a boar; the feudal nobles only a ram and a boar; and the common  people, scallions and eggs in spring, wheat and fish in summer, millet  and a sucking-pig in autumn, and unhulled rice and a goose in winter.  If there was anything infelicitous about the victim intended for God, it  was used for Hou Chi. The victim intended for God required to be kept in  a clean stall for three months; that for Hou Chi simply required to  be perfect in its parts. This was the way in which they distinguished  between heavenly and earthly spirits.    In primeval times, we are told, sacrifices consisted of meat and drink,  the latter being the \"mysterious liquid,\" water, for which wine was  substituted later on. The ancients roasted millet and pieces of pork;  they made a hole in the ground and scooped the water from it with their  two hands, beating upon an earthen drum with a clay drumstick. Thus they  expressed their reverence for spiritual beings.    \"Sacrifices,\" according to the _Book of Rites_ (Legge's translation),  \"should not be frequently repeated. Such frequency is an indication of  importunateness; and importunateness is inconsistent with reverence. Nor  should they be at distant intervals. Such infrequency is indicative  of indifference; and indifference leads to forgetting them altogether.  Therefore the superior man, in harmony with the course of Nature, offers  the sacrifices of spring and autumn. When he treads on the dew which  has descended as hoar-frost he cannot help a feeling of sadness, which  arises in his mind, and which cannot be ascribed to the cold. In spring,  when he treads on the ground, wet with the rains and dews that have  fallen heavily, he cannot avoid being moved by a feeling as if he were  seeing his departed friends. We meet the approach of our friends with  music, and escort them away with sadness, and hence at the sacrifice in  spring we use music, but not at the sacrifice in autumn.\"    \"Sacrifice is not a thing coming to a man from without; it issues from  within him, and has its birth in his heart. When the heart is deeply  moved, expression is given to it by ceremonies; and hence, only men  of ability and virtue can give complete exhibition to the idea of  sacrifice.\" It was in this sense that Confucius warned his followers not  to sacrifice to spirits which did not belong to them, i.e. to other than  those of their own immediate ancestors. To do otherwise would raise a  suspicion of ulterior motives.    Ancestral Worship.--For the purpose of ancestral worship, which had been  practised from the earliest ages, the Emperor had seven shrines, each  with its altar representing various forefathers; and at all of these a  sacrifice was offered every month. Feudal nobles could have only five  sets of these, and the various officials three or fewer, on a descending  scale in proportion to their rank. Petty officers and the people  generally had no ancestral shrine, but worshipped the shades of their  forefathers as best they could in their houses and cottages.    For three days before sacrificing to ancestors, a strict vigil and  purification was maintained, and by the end of that time, from sheer  concentration of thought, the mourner was able to see the spirits of  the departed; and at the sacrifice next day seemed to hear their very  movements, and even the murmur of their sighs.    The object of the ceremony was to bring down the spirits from above,  together with the shades of ancestors, and thus to secure the blessing  of God; at the same time to please the souls of the departed, and to  create a link between the living and the dead.    \"The object in sacrifices is not to pray; the time should not be  hastened on; a great apparatus is not required; ornamental details are  not to be approved; the victims need not be fat and large (cf. Horace,  Od. III, 23; _Immunis aram_, etc.); a profusion of the other offerings  is not to be admired.\" There must, however, be no parsimony. A high  official, well able to afford better things, was justly blamed for  having sacrificed to the manes of his father a sucking-pig which did not  fill the dish.    Religious Dances.--\"The various dances displayed the gravity of the  performers, but did not awaken the emotion of delight. The ancestral  temple produced the impression of majesty, but did not dispose one to  rest on it.

Once again I felt  the agonizing, dagger sharp pain in my throat and--darkness._    _Have you ever wakened to a bright, sunny afternoon and heard yourself  pronounced dead? They spoke in low, hushed tones. How unfortunate. Young  fellow only thirty, dying so far away from his homeland. No family. Good  thing he was well-set in life. This sudden anemia was most  extraordinary; fellow showed no signs of it previously. All he had  really needed was rest. If he had recovered, that lovely Eve Orcaczy  might have made both their lives happier, richer. Sad ending to what  might have been an idyll. Good of her to claim the body. She said she  was going to inter it in the family vault in_ Konigstein Mountain _in  Transylvania._    _I heard them distinctly. I wanted to shout that I wasn't dead; I wanted  to wake up from this horrible nightmare. I was as alive as they. I knew  I had to get out of there, some way; to get away from Eve, whom I now  feared. They left to make arrangements._    _The lassitude crept through me without warning; I dozed in spite of  myself. And I dreamed again. I was a cat running, leaping through  windows, loping over the countryside, stopping for no one. I panted with  my exertions. Towns and cities flew by; I had to get someplace and  quickly. Then the dream ended._    _\"Tod,\" she said, \"Get up, my dear.\" I heard Her and I hated Her. Hated  Her while I was drawn to Her. There was a white mist before my eyes. I  reached up to brush it away. It was not a mist; it was a cloth. I  shivered._    _\"I must wake up,\" I whispered hoarsely, \"I must! I'm going mad!\"_    _There was a creaking sound and daylight descended upon me. When I saw  where I was, I covered my face with my hands and sobbed. I tried to  pray, but the words froze on my lips._ I was sitting in a coffin in a  mausoleum! I had been buried alive!    _\"What am I?\" I shrieked. \"Where am I and what have You done? I'm out of  my mind; stark, staring mad!\"_    _Eve's lips parted, showing the even white teeth--those slightly pointed  teeth._    _\"You're quite sane, my dear,\" She said calmly. \"You are now one of us;  a revenant, even as I, and to live you must feed on the living.\"_    _\"It's not true!\" I shouted. \"This is all a crazy nightmare, part of my  illness! You're not real! Nothing is real!\"_    _\"I'm quite real, Tod. To be trite, I am what I am, and have accepted it  calmly, as you shall in time. I have told you of my life. You have been  a student of legends. Legends are often--more often than you  think--reality. When one has been murdered, if one has lived a so-called  wicked life, he is doomed to walk the earth battening on the living. My  fate was sealed as I lay in my coffin. But that wasn't enough. As I lay  there, my pet cat, Suma, slunk into the room and leapt over me. That was  a double insurance of my life after death. Those whom I mark for my own  must, too, live on. Accept it, my dear. You have no other choice.\"_    _\"No!\" I cried. \"I'm an American! Things like this don't happen to us!  It's only in stories, and then to foreigners!\"_    _She chuckled drily. \"I'm afraid these things do happen, and in this  case, you're it, my dear. Make the best of it.\"_    _But I wouldn't; I refused to--for a while. I would not feast on the  blood of the living. Something within me fought. For a time._    _Then, the awful hunger began. The tearing pangs of hunger that ordinary  food wouldn't arrest. I fought it as long as I could. I lost._    _First it was small animals; animals that I loved. It was my life or  theirs. Then there was a little girl; a dear little creature who might  have been my child under different circumstances._    _After the episode of the little girl, Eve left me. She had no further  use for me; she had wanted the child, too, and I had got it. I was now  competition to be shunned. I was alone once again alone and thoroughly  miserable. I couldn't understand myself, my motives, so how could I  expect someone else to understand?_    _I only knew what I was; nor could I rationalize on why I had become  this way. I could only presume it had happened to others equally as  innocent as myself of wrong-doing. In the daytime, when I was like  others, I reproached myself; goodness knows I loathed myself and what I  had to do in order to \"live.\" I wished I might really die, for I was  tired--so frightfully tired and sick of it all. But I knew of no way to  accomplish this, so I had to bear it all, fasting until my voracious,  disgusting appetites got the better of me._    _I decided there must be some information on my kind, particularly in  this area where vampire legends are rife, so I took to haunting reading  rooms. It was there I met Maria. She told me, after we knew each other  better, that she was doing graduate work in regional superstitions and  had decided that her thesis would treat of the history of vampirism. She  found it terribly amusing, but at the same time frightening: Didn't I? I  fear I saw nothing laughable about it, but I held my peace. Why, I could  have done a thesis for her that would have driven some mild-mannered  prof completely out of his mind! I kept my knowledge to myself, though;  I didn't want to scare Maria._    _She was like a flash of sunshine in a darkened room. She made each day  worth living. For the first time the hunger pangs ceased. Ceased for one  week, then two. I was certain I was cured. Perhaps, I thought, the whole  thing was just a dream and I am finally awake._    _I felt then I had the right to tell her of my love. She looked  infinitely sad. She wasn't certain, she said. She knew she was awfully  fond of me, but she was confused. She had just come away from the  States, trying to make up her mind about someone dear, whom she didn't  want to hurt, and she wanted a breather. I said I would wait up to and  through eternity, if she wished._    _Things, went along peacefully then. We would walk for hours together,  walk in complete silence and understanding. My strength seemed to be  returning more day by day. We went far afield in search of material for  her thesis. She would track down the most minute speck of hearsay, to  get authenticity._    _One day, in our wanderings, I thoughtlessly let myself be led too near  my resting place. One of the locals mentioned a \"place of horror\" nearby  and Maria wanted to investigate. I had no choice. We poked amid the  still fustiness of the deserted mausoleum I knew so well. She thought it  odd that the door was unlocked. I said, yes, wasn't it. Then she saw the  box, that gleaming copper box which Eve had so thoughtfully provided.  She stroked it gently, commenting on its beauty, and before I could  prevent it or divert her attention, she had lifted the heavy lid  exposing the disarranged shroud, the remains of one or two hapless small  creatures, the horrible blood-stained satin lining. She screamed and  dropped the lid, somehow pinching her finger. She hopped on one foot, as  one usually does to fight down sudden pain. Then she was clinging to me,  thoroughly frightened._    _\"What does it mean, Tod?\"_    _I quieted her with the usual platitudes. Then I was kissing that poor,  red little finger. Without warning to myself or her, I nipped it  affectionately. A warm glow spread through me; there was a taste more  delightful than fine old brandy, or vintage wine, and I knew irrevocably  that I was not cured; no, nor ever should be! And I knew, too, that I  wanted Maria--not just as a man longs for the woman he loves--but to  drink of the fountain of her life, that warm, intoxicating fountain,  greedily, joyously. She never knew what went through my mind at that  moment. If I could have killed myself then, I would have, and with no  compunction. But there is more to killing a revenant than that. The  Church knows the procedure. I hurried Maria home as fast as I could and  told her I had to go away for a week on business. She believed me and  said she would miss me. But I didn't go away. That night I fought a  losing battle with myself, and then and every night thereafter, I  returned to her, partook of her and slunk away, loathing myself. I knew  that I must soon kill the one being I loved above all others, kill, too,  her immortal soul, and there was nothing I could do to prevent it._    _She began to fade visibly. When I \"returned\" in a week, she was so ill  that a few steps tired her. Her appetite all but vanished. She seemed  genuinely glad to see me. She was beset by nightmares, she said. Could I  help her get some rest? I took her to a physician who sagely prescribed  a change in climate, rest and a diet rich in blood and iron, gave her a  prescription for sedatives, and called it a day._    _You know how she looked when you saw her. The day was approaching when  she would have no more blood, when life as you know it would stop and  she would become like me. Somehow I couldn't take her with me without  some warning, but I didn't know how to do it. You see, since I was an  innocent victim myself. I could speak, could warn my intended victim,  because although my soul had all but died, there was still a spark that  evil hadn't touched. I knew she would think it a joke if I told her  about myself without warning._    _Then, happily for me, you came along. I knew you would sense something  amiss and I didn't care. I was almost certain of her love, and I decided  to seize the few minutes left me and devil take the hindmost! When you  told her to confront me, you gave me the happiest days of my life. For  this I thank you sincerely. For what I have done and will ask you to do,  forgive me!_    _Maria asked me directly, as you had known she would. I replied frankly,  sparing her nothing. I told her that the fact that this life had been  wished on me, as it were, gave me some rights, and that I could tell her  how to rid herself of me, if she wished. Then she turned to me, her  large, lovely eyes"]]]
