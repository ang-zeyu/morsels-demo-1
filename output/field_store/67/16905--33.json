Purl is sometimes  manufactured with a coloured silk twisted round the metal though not  concealing it, and giving rich tints to the work.           *       *       *       *       *    _Spangles_ were anciently much used in embroidery, and were sometimes  of pure gold. They are but little used now.           *       *       *       *       *    _Plate_ consists of narrow plates of gold or silver stitched on to the  embroidery by threads of silk, which pass over them.           *       *       *       *       *    The French and English gold thread is made of thin plates of metal cut  into strips, and wound round strands of cotton in the same manner as  the Japanese gold. If the metal is real, the cost is of course great.  It is sold by weight, gold being about 20s. per oz., and silver, 10s.  per oz. In addition to its superiority in wear, it has this advantage,  that old gold or silver thread is always of intrinsic value, and may  be sold at the current price of the metal whatever state it may be in.  Many varieties of gilt thread are manufactured in France and England,  which may be used when the great expense of \"real gold\" is objected  to. But although it looks equally well at first, it soon becomes  tarnished, and spoils the effect of the embroidery. Gold and silver  threads are difficult to work with in England, and especially in  London, as damp and coal-smoke tarnish them almost before the work is  out of the frame. Mrs. Dolby recommends cloves being placed in the  papers in which they are kept.      [Decoration]    RECIPES FOR PRESERVING GOLD.    We give here two recipes, which may be found serviceable. They are  from different sources; the first is a very old one. They may preserve  gold for a certain time.    1. Isinglass dissolved in spirits of wine and brushed over the thread  or braid, which should be hung over something to dry, and not touched  with the hand.    2. Spirits of wine and mastic varnish mixed very thin and put on in  the same way with a brush.    [Decoration]          [Decoration]    CHAPTER II.    TEXTILE FABRICS USED AS GROUNDS FOR EMBROIDERY.      LINENS.    There are many varieties of unglazed, half-bleached linens, from that  thirty-six and forty inches wide, used for chair-back covers, to that  ninety inches wide, used for large table-covers, curtains, &c. There  are also endless varieties of fancy linens, both of hand and  power-loom weaving, for summer dresses, for bed furniture, chair-back  covers, table-cloths, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    _Flax_ is the unbleached brown linen, often used for chair-back  covers.           *       *       *       *       *    _Twill_ is a thick linen suitable for coverings for furniture.           *       *       *       *       *    _Kirriemuir Twill_ is a fine twilled linen made at Kirriemuir, and is  good for tennis aprons, dresses, curtains, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    _Sailcloth_ is a stout linen, of yellow colour, and is only suitable  for screen panels.           *       *       *       *       *    _Oatcake Linen_, so called from its resemblance to Scotch oatcake, has  been popular for screen panels or washstand backs. It is very coarse  and rough.           *       *       *       *       *    _Oatmeal Linen_ is finer and of a greyer tone. It is also used for  screens, and for smaller articles.           *       *       *       *       *    _Smock Linen_ is a strong even green cloth. It makes an excellent  ground for working screens, and is also used for tennis aprons.           *       *       *       *       *    _Crash._--Properly speaking, the name \"_crash_\" is only applied to the  coarse Russian home-spun linen, which has been such a favourite from  the beauty of its tone of colour. It is, however, erroneously applied  to all linens used for embroidery, whether woven by hand-loom or  machinery; and this confusion of names frequently leads to mistakes.  Crash is almost always very coarse, is never more than eighteen inches  wide, and cannot be mistaken for a machine-made fabric. It is woven by  the Russian peasants in their own homes, in lengths varying from five  to ten yards, and, therefore, though sent over in large bales, it is  very difficult to find two pieces among a hundred that in any way  match each other.           *       *       *       *       *    _Bolton, or Workhouse Sheeting_, is a coarse twilled cotton fabric,  seventy-two inches wide, of a beautiful soft creamy colour, which  improves much in washing. It is inexpensive, and an excellent ground  for embroidery, either for curtains, counterpanes, chair coverings, or  for ladies' dresses, or tennis aprons.    It resembles the twilled cotton on which so much of the old crewel  embroidery was worked in the seventeenth century, and is one of the  most satisfactory materials when of really good quality.           *       *       *       *       *    All descriptions of linen, except the \"oatcake\" and \"sailcloth,\" can  be embroidered in the hand.    [Decoration]      [Decoration]    TEXTILE FABRICS.    SATINS AND SILKS.    _Satins and Silks_ can only be embroidered in a frame. Furniture  satins of stout make, with cotton backs, may be used without backing;  but ordinary dress satins require to have a thin cotton or linen  backing to bear the strains of the work and framing. Nothing is more  beautiful than a rich white satin for a dress embroidered in coloured  silks.    For fans, a very fine, closely woven satin is necessary, as it will  not fold evenly unless the satin is thin; and yet it must be rich  enough to sustain the fine embroidery, without pulling, or looking  poor. A special kind of satin is made for the manufacture of fans, and  none other is available.           *       *       *       *       *    \"_Silk Sheeting_\" of good quality, \"_Satin de Chine_\" and other  silk-faced materials of the same class, may either be embroidered in  the hand, or framed; but for large pieces of work a frame is  essential. These materials are suitable for curtains, counterpanes,  piano coverings, or panels, and indeed for almost any purpose. The  finer qualities are very beautiful for dresses, as they take rich and  graceful folds, and carry embroidery well.           *       *       *       *       *    _Tussore and Corah Silks_ are charming for summer dresses, light  chair-back covers, or embroidered window blinds. They will only bear  light embroidering in silk or filoselle.    Within the last year successful experiments have been made in dyeing  these Indian silks in England. The exact shades which we admire so  much in the old Oriental embroideries have been reproduced, with the  additional advantage of being perfectly fast in colour.    Nothing can be more charming as lining for table-covers, screens,  curtains, &c.; and they are rather less expensive than other lining  silks.    The fabrics known as _Plain Tapestries_ are a mixture of silk and  cotton, manufactured in imitation of the handworked backgrounds so  frequent in ancient embroideries--especially Venetian. Almost all the  varieties of _Opus Pulvinarium_, or cushion stitch, have been  reproduced in these woven fabrics.           *       *       *       *       *    _Brocatine_ is a silk-faced material, woven to imitate couched  embroidery. The silk is thrown to the surface and is tied with cotton  threads from the back.    As ground for embroidery it has an excellent effect.      [Decoration]    TEXTILE FABRICS.    COTTONS AND WOOLLENS.    _Velveteen_, if of good quality, makes an excellent ground for screen  panels, chair-covers, portieres, curtains, borders, &c. It can be  worked in the hand if the embroidery be not too heavy or large in  style.           *       *       *       *       *    _Utrecht Velvet_ is only suitable for coarse crewel or tapestry wool  embroidery. It is fit for curtain dados or wide borderings.           *       *       *       *       *    _Velvet Cloth_ is a rich plain cloth, finished without any gloss. It  is a good ground for embroidery, either for curtains or altar-cloths.  It is two yards wide.           *       *       *       *       *    _Felt_ is sometimes used for the same purposes, but does not wear  nearly so well, and is difficult to work.           *       *       *       *       *    _Diagonal Cloth_ can be worked either in the hand or frame, although  it is always much better in the latter. It is used for table-covers,  curtains, chair-seats, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    _Serge_ is usually made thirty-six inches wide. It has long been in  favour for curtains, small table-covers, dresses, &c. It can now be  obtained at the school fifty-four inches wide, in many shades.           *       *       *       *       *    _Soft or Super Serge_, also fifty-four inches wide, is an excellent  material, much superior in appearance to diagonal cloth, or to the  ordinary rough serge. It takes embroidery well.           *       *       *       *       *    _Cricketing flannel_ is used for coverlets for cots, children's  dresses, and many other purposes. It is of a beautiful creamy colour,  and is a good ground for fine crewel or silk embroidery. It need not  be worked in a frame.           *       *       *       *       *    _Genoa or Lyons Velvet_ makes a beautiful ground for embroidery; but  it can only be worked in a frame, and requires to be \"backed\" with a  thin cotton or linen lining, if it is to sustain any mass of  embroidery. For small articles, such as sachets or casket-covers, when  the work is fine and small, the backing is not necessary. Screen  panels of velvet, worked wholly in crewels, or with crewel brightened  with silk, are very effective. Three-piled velvet is the best for  working upon, but is so expensive that it is seldom asked for.           *       *       *       *       *    _Silk Velvet Plush_ (a new "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24968"],[0,"Behind the Scenes (#3)"],[1,"hopes to see her soon. Alas! he looked forward to a meeting in vain.  Year after year the one great hope swelled in his heart, but the hope  was only realized beyond the dark portals of the grave.    When I was about seven years old I witnessed, for the first time, the  sale of a human being. We were living at Prince Edward, in Virginia, and  master had just purchased his hogs for the winter, for which he was  unable to pay in full. To escape from his embarrassment it was necessary  to sell one of the slaves. Little Joe, the son of the cook, was selected  as the victim. His mother was ordered to dress him up in his Sunday  clothes, and send him to the house. He came in with a bright face, was  placed in the scales, and was sold, like the hogs, at so much per pound.  His mother was kept in ignorance of the transaction, but her suspicions  were aroused. When her son started for Petersburgh in the wagon, the  truth began to dawn upon her mind, and she pleaded piteously that her  boy should not be taken from her; but master quieted her by telling her  that he was simply going to town with the wagon, and would be back in  the morning. Morning came, but little Joe did not return to his mother.  Morning after morning passed, and the mother went down to the grave  without ever seeing her child again. One day she was whipped for  grieving for her lost boy. Colonel Burwell never liked to see one of his  slaves wear a sorrowful face, and those who offended in this particular  way were always punished. Alas! the sunny face of the slave is not  always an indication of sunshine in the heart. Colonel Burwell at one  time owned about seventy slaves, all of which were sold, and in a  majority of instances wives were separated from husbands and children  from their parents. Slavery in the Border States forty years ago was  different from what it was twenty years ago. Time seemed to soften the  hearts of master and mistress, and to insure kinder and more humane  treatment to bondsmen and bondswomen. When I was quite a child, an  incident occurred which my mother afterward impressed more strongly on  my mind. One of my uncles, a slave of Colonel Burwell, lost a pair of  ploughlines, and when the loss was made known the master gave him a new  pair, and told him that if he did not take care of them he would punish  him severely. In a few weeks the second pair of lines was stolen, and my  uncle hung himself rather than meet the displeasure of his master. My  mother went to the spring in the morning for a pail of water, and on  looking up into the willow tree which shaded the bubbling crystal  stream, she discovered the lifeless form of her brother suspended  beneath one of the strong branches. Rather than be punished the way  Colonel Burwell punished his servants, he took his own life. Slavery had  its dark side as well as its bright side.          CHAPTER II    GIRLHOOD AND ITS SORROWS      I must pass rapidly over the stirring events of my early life. When I  was about fourteen years old I went to live with my master's eldest son,  a Presbyterian minister. His salary was small, and he was burdened with  a helpless wife, a girl that he had married in the humble walks of life.  She was morbidly sensitive, and imagined that I regarded her with  contemptuous feelings because she was of poor parentage. I was their  only servant, and a gracious loan at that. They were not able to buy me,  so my old master sought to render them assistance by allowing them the  benefit of my services. From the very first I did the work of three  servants, and yet I was scolded and regarded with distrust. The years  passed slowly, and I continued to serve them, and at the same time grew  into strong, healthy womanhood. I was nearly eighteen when we removed  from Virginia to Hillsboro', North Carolina, where young Mr. Burwell  took charge of a church. The salary was small, and we still had to  practise the closest economy. Mr. Bingham, a hard, cruel man, the  village schoolmaster, was a member of my young master's church, and he  was a frequent visitor to the parsonage. She whom I called mistress  seemed to be desirous to wreak vengeance on me for something, and  Bingham became her ready tool. During this time my master was unusually  kind to me; he was naturally a good-hearted man, but was influenced by  his wife. It was Saturday evening, and while I was bending over the bed,  watching the baby that I had just hushed into slumber, Mr. Bingham came  to the door and asked me to go with him to his study. Wondering what he  meant by his strange request, I followed him, and when we had entered  the study he closed the door, and in his blunt way remarked: \"Lizzie, I  am going to flog you.\" I was thunderstruck, and tried to think if I had  been remiss in anything. I could not recollect of doing anything to  deserve punishment, and with surprise exclaimed: \"Whip me, Mr. Bingham!  what for?\"    \"No matter,\" he replied, \"I am going to whip you, so take down your  dress this instant.\"    Recollect, I was eighteen years of age, was a woman fully developed, and  yet this man coolly bade me take down my dress. I drew myself up  proudly, firmly, and said: \"No, Mr. Bingham, I shall not take down my  dress before you. Moreover, you shall not whip me unless you prove the  stronger. Nobody has a right to whip me but my own master, and nobody  shall do so if I can prevent it.\"    My words seemed to exasperate him. He seized a rope, caught me roughly,  and tried to tie me. I resisted with all my strength, but he was the  stronger of the two, and after a hard struggle succeeded in binding my  hands and tearing my dress from my back. Then he picked up a rawhide,  and began to ply it freely over my shoulders. With steady hand and  practised eye he would raise the instrument of torture, nerve himself  for a blow, and with fearful force the rawhide descended upon the  quivering flesh. It cut the skin, raised great welts, and the warm blood  trickled down my back. Oh God! I can feel the torture now--the terrible,  excruciating agony of those moments. I did not scream; I was too proud  to let my tormentor know what I was suffering. I closed my lips firmly,  that not even a groan might escape from them, and I stood like a statue  while the keen lash cut deep into my flesh. As soon as I was released,  stunned with pain, bruised and bleeding, I went home and rushed into the  presence of the pastor and his wife, wildly exclaiming: \"Master Robert,  why did you let Mr. Bingham flog me? What have I done that I should be  so punished?\"    \"Go away,\" he gruffly answered, \"do not bother me.\"    I would not be put off thus. \"What _have_ I done? I _will_ know why I  have been flogged.\"    I saw his cheeks flush with anger, but I did not move. He rose to his  feet, and on my refusing to go without an explanation, seized a chair,  struck me, and felled me to the floor. I rose, bewildered, almost dead  with pain, crept to my room, dressed my bruised arms and back as best I  could, and then lay down, but not to sleep. No, I could not sleep, for I  was suffering mental as well as bodily torture. My spirit rebelled  against the unjustness that had been inflicted upon me, and though I  tried to smother my anger and to forgive those who had been so cruel to  me, it was impossible. The next morning I was more calm, and I believe  that I could then have forgiven everything for the sake of one kind  word. But the kind word was not proffered, and it may be possible that I  grew somewhat wayward and sullen. Though I had faults, I know now, as I  felt then, harshness was the poorest inducement for the correction of  them. It seems that Mr. Bingham had pledged himself to Mrs. Burwell to  subdue what he called my \"stubborn pride.\" On Friday following the  Saturday on which I was so savagely beaten, Mr. Bingham again directed  me come to his study. I went, but with the determination to offer  resistance should he attempt to flog me again. On entering the room I  found him prepared with a new rope and a new cowhide. I told him that I  was ready to die, but that he could not conquer me. In struggling with  him I bit his finger severely, when he seized a heavy stick and beat me  with it in a shameful manner. Again I went home sore and bleeding, but  with pride as strong and defiant as ever. The following Thursday Mr.  Bingham again tried to conquer me, but in vain. We struggled, and he  struck me many savage blows. As I stood bleeding before him, nearly  exhausted with his efforts, he burst into tears, and declared that it  would be a sin to beat me any more. My suffering at last subdued his  hard heart; he asked my forgiveness, and afterwards was an altered man.  He was never known to strike one of his servants from that day forward.  Mr. Burwell, he who preached the love of Heaven, who glorified the  precepts and examples of Christ, who expounded the Holy Scriptures  Sabbath after Sabbath from the pulpit, when Mr. Bingham refused to whip  me any more, was urged by his wife to punish me himself. One morning he  went to the wood-pile, took an oak broom, cut the handle off, and with  this heavy handle attempted to conquer me. I fought him, but he proved  the strongest. At the sight of my bleeding form, his wife fell upon her  knees and begged him to desist. My distress even touched her cold,  jealous heart. I was so badly bruised that I was unable to leave my bed  for five days. I will not dwell upon the bitter anguish of these hours,  for even the thought of them now makes me shudder. The Rev. Mr. Burwell  was not yet satisfied. He resolved to make another attempt to subdue my  proud, rebellious spirit--made the attempt and again failed, when he  told me, with an air of penitence, that he should never strike me  another blow; and faithfully he kept his word. These revolting scenes  created a great sensation at the time, were the talk of the town and  neighborhood, and I flatter myself that the actions of those"]]]
