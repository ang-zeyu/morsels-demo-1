To offer the least violence to a Persian woman, was to incur certain  death from her husband or guardian. Even their kings, though the most  absolute in the universe, could not alter the manners or customs of the  country, which related to the fair sex.    Widely different from this is the present state of Persia. By a law of  that country, their monarch is now authorized to go, whenever he  pleases, into the harem of any of his subjects; and the subject, on  whose prerogative he thus encroaches, so far from exerting his usual  jealousy, thinks himself highly honored by such a visit.    A laughable story, on this subject, is told of Shah Abbas, who having  got drunk at the house of one of his favorites, and intending to go into  the apartment of his wives, was stopped by the door-keeper, who bluntly  told him, \"Not a man, sir, besides my master, shall put a mustachio  here, so long as I am porter.\" \"What,\" said the king, \"dost thou not  know me?\" \"Yes,\" answered the fellow, \"I know that you are king of the  men, but not of the women.\"      GRECIAN WOMEN.    Woman, in ancient Greece, seems to have been regarded merely in the  light of an instrument for raising up members of the state. And surely  it may be said of them that they nobly fulfilled this duty. The  catalogue of heroes and sages which shine in Grecian history bright and  numerous as stars in the firmament, are so many testimonials to the  faithfulness of Grecian women in this respect.    The sexes were but little society for each other. Even husbands were, in  Sparta, limited as to the time and duration of the visits made to their  wives.    That women in ancient Greece did not enjoy that delicate consideration  which other refined nations accord to their sex, may be inferred from  the inferiority of the apartments allotted to them. The famous Helen is  said to have had her chamber in the attic; and Penelope, the queen of  Ulysses, descended from hers by a ladder.      GRECIAN COURTEZANS.    The rank which the courtezans enjoyed, even in the brightest ages of  Greece, and particularly at Athens, is one of the greatest singularities  in the manners of any people. By what circumstances could that order of  women, who debase at once their own sex and ours--in a country where the  women were possessed of modesty, and the men of sentiment, arrive at  distinction, and sometimes even at the highest degree of reputation and  consequence? Several reasons may be assigned for that phenomenon in  society.    In Greece, the courtezans were in some measure connected with the  religion of the country. The Goddess of Beauty had her altars; and she  was supposed to protect prostitution, which was to her a species of  worship. The people invoked Venus in times of danger; and, after a  battle, they thought they had done honor to Miltiades and Themistocles,  because the Laises and the Glyceras of the age had chaunted hymns to  their Goddess.    The courtezans were likewise connected with religion, by means of the  arts. Their persons afforded models for statues, which were afterwards  adored in the temples. Phryne served as a model to Praxiteles, for his  Venus of Cnidus. During the feasts of Neptune, near Eleusis, Apelles  having seen the same courtezan on the sea-shore, without any other veil  than her loose and flowing hair, was so much struck with her appearance,  that he borrowed from it the idea of his Venus rising from the waves.    They were, therefore connected with statuary and painting, as they  furnished the practisers of those arts with the means of embellishing  their works.    The greater part of them were skilled in music; and, as that art was  attended with higher effects in Greece than it ever was in any other  country, it must have possessed, in their hands, an irresistible charm.    Every one knows how enthusiastic the Greeks were of beauty. They adored  it in the temples. They admired it in the principal works of art. They  studied it in the exercises and the games. They thought to perfect it by  their marriages. They offered rewards to it at the public festivals. But  virtuous beauty was seldom to be seen. The modest women were confined to  their own apartments, and were visited only by their husbands and  nearest relations. The courtezans offered themselves every where to  view; and their beauty as might be expected, obtained universal homage.    Greece was governed by eloquent men; and the celebrated courtezans,  having an influence over those orators must have had an influence on  public affairs. There was not one, not even the thundering, the  inflexible Demosthenes, so terrible to tyrants, but was subjected to  their sway. Of that great master of eloquence it has been said, \"What he  had been a whole year in erecting, a woman overturned in a day.\" That  influence augmented their consequence; and their talent of pleasing  increased with the occasions of exerting it.    The laws and the public institutions, indeed, by authorizing the  privacy of women, set a high value on the sanctity of the marriage vow.  But in Athens, imagination, sentiment, luxury, the taste in arts and  pleasures, was opposite to the laws. The courtezans, therefore may be  said to have come in support of the manners.    There was no check upon public licentiousness; but private infidelity,  which concerned the peace of families, was punished as a crime. By a  strange and perhaps unequalled singularity the men were corrupted, yet  the domestic manners were pure. It seems as if the courtezans had not  been considered to belong to their sex; and, by a convention to which  the laws and the manners bended, while other women were estimated merely  by their virtues, they were estimated only by their accomplishments.    These reasons will in some measure, account for the honors, which the  votaries of Venus so often received in Greece. Otherwise we should have  been at a loss to conceive, why six or seven writers had exerted their  talents to celebrate the courtezans of Athens--why three great painters  had uniformly devoted their pencils to represent them on canvass--and  why so many poets had strove to immortalize them in verses. We should  hardly have believed that so many illustrious men had courted their  society--that Aspasia had been consulted in deliberations of peace and  war--that Phryne had a statue of gold placed between the statues of two  kings at Delphos--that, after death, magnificent tombs had been erected  to their memory.    \"The traveller,\" says a Greek writer, \"who, approaching to Athens, sees  on the side of the way a monument which attracts his notice at a  distance, will imagine that it is the tomb of Miltiades or Pericles, or  of some other great man, who has done honor to his country by his  services. He advances, he reads, and he learns that it is a courtezan of  Athens who is interred with so much pomp.\"    Theopompus, in a letter to Alexander the Great, speaks also of the same  monument in words to the following effect--\"Thus, after her death, is a  prostitute honored; while not one of those brave warriors who fell in  Asia, fighting for you, and for the safety of Greece, has so much as a  stone erected to his memory, or an inscription to preserve his ashes  from insult.\"    Such was the homage which that enthusiastic people, voluptuous and  passionate, paid to beauty. More guided by sentiment than reason, and  having laws rather than principles, they banished their great men,  honored their courtezans, murdered Socrates, permitted themselves to be  governed by Aspasia, preserved inviolate the marriage bed, and placed  Phryne in the temple of Apollo!      ROMAN WOMEN.    Among the Romans, a grave and austere people, who, during five hundred  years, were unacquainted with the elegancies and the pleasures of life,  and who, in the middle of furrows and fields of battle, were employed in  tillage or in war, the manners of the women were a long time as solemn  and severe as those of the men, and without the smallest mixture of  corruption, or of weakness.    The time when the Roman women began to appear in public, marks a  particular era in history.    The Roman women, for many ages, were respected over the whole world.  Their victorious husbands re-visited them with transport, at their  return from battle. They laid at their feet the spoils of the enemy, and  endeared themselves in their eyes by the wounds which they had received  for them and for the state. Those warriors often came from imposing  commands upon kings, and in their own houses accounted it an honor to  obey. In vain the too rigid laws made them the arbiters of life and  death. More powerful than the laws, the women ruled their judges. In  vain the legislature, foreseeing the wants which exist only among a  corrupt people, permitted divorce. The indulgence of the polity was  proscribed by the manners.    Such was the influence of beauty at Rome before the licentious  intercourse of the sexes had corrupted both.    The Roman matrons do not seem to have possessed that military courage  which Plutarch has praised in certain Greek and barbarian women; they  partook more of the nature of their sex; or, at least, they departed  less from its character. Their first quality was decency. Every one  knows the story of Cato the censor, _who stabbed a Roman Senator for  kissing his own wife in the presence of his daughter_.    To these austere manners, the Roman women joined an enthusiastic love of  their country, which discovered itself upon many great occasions. On the  death of Brutus, they all clothed themselves in mourning. In the time of  Coriolanus they saved the city.

The soldiers, too, were discontented. They hated Popery indeed; and they  had not loved the banished King. But they keenly felt that, in the short  campaign which had decided the fate of their country, theirs had been an  inglorious part. Forty fine regiments, a regular army such as had  never before marched to battle under the royal standard of England,  had retreated precipitately before an invader, and had then, without a  struggle, submitted to him. That great force had been absolutely of no  account in the late change, had done nothing towards keeping William  out, and had done nothing towards bringing him in. The clowns, who,  armed with pitchforks and mounted on carthorses, had straggled in  the train of Lovelace or Delamere, had borne a greater part in the  Revolution than those splendid household troops, whose plumed hats,  embroidered coats, and curvetting chargers the Londoners had so often  seen with admiration in Hyde Park. The mortification of the army was  increased by the taunts of the foreigners, taunts which neither orders  nor punishments could entirely restrain. [5] At several places the anger  which a brave and highspirited body of men might, in such circumstances,  be expected to feel, showed itself in an alarming manner. A battalion  which lay at Cirencester put out the bonfires, huzzaed for King James,  and drank confusion to his daughter and his nephew. The garrison of  Plymouth disturbed the rejoicings of the County of Cornwall: blows were  exchanged, and a man was killed in the fray. [6]    The ill humour of the clergy and of the army could not but be noticed by  the most heedless; for the clergy and the army were distinguished from  other classes by obvious peculiarities of garb. \"Black coats and red  coats,\" said a vehement Whig in the House of Commons, \"are the curses  of the nation.\" [7] But the discontent was not confined to the black coats  and the red coats. The enthusiasm with which men of all classes had  welcomed William to London at Christmas had greatly abated before the  close of February. The new king had, at the very moment at which  his fame and fortune reached the highest point, predicted the coming  reaction. That reaction might, indeed, have been predicted by a less  sagacious observer of human affairs. For it is to be chiefly ascribed  to a law as certain as the laws which regulate the succession of the  seasons and the course of the trade winds. It is the nature of man to  overrate present evil, and to underrate present good; to long for what  he has not, and to be dissatisfied with what he has. This propensity, as  it appears in individuals, has often been noticed both by laughing  and by weeping philosophers. It was a favourite theme of Horace and  of Pascal, of Voltaire and of Johnson. To its influence on the fate  of great communities may be ascribed most of the revolutions and  counterrevolutions recorded in history. A hundred generations have  elapsed since the first great national emancipation, of which an account  has come down to us. We read in the most ancient of books that a  people bowed to the dust under a cruel yoke, scourged to toil by hard  taskmasters, not supplied with straw, yet compelled to furnish the daily  tale of bricks, became sick of life, and raised such a cry of misery as  pierced the heavens. The slaves were wonderfully set free: at the moment  of their liberation they raised a song of gratitude and triumph: but, in  a few hours, they began to regret their slavery, and to murmur against  the leader who had decoyed them away from the savoury fare of the house  of bondage to the dreary waste which still separated them from the land  flowing with milk and honey. Since that time the history of every great  deliverer has been the history of Moses retold. Down to the present  hour rejoicings like those on the shore of the Red Sea have ever been  speedily followed by murmurings like those at the Waters of Strife. [8]  The most just and salutary revolution must produce much suffering. The  most just and salutary revolution cannot produce all the good that had  been expected from it by men of uninstructed minds and sanguine tempers.  Even the wisest cannot, while it is still recent, weigh quite fairly the  evils which it has caused against the evils which it has removed. For  the evils which it has caused are felt; and the evils which it has  removed are felt no longer.    Thus it was now in England. The public was, as it always is during  the cold fits which follow its hot fits, sullen, hard to please,  dissatisfied with itself, dissatisfied with those who had lately been  its favourites. The truce between the two great parties was at an end.  Separated by the memory of all that had been done and suffered during a  conflict of half a century, they had been, during a few months, united  by a common danger. But the danger was over: the union was dissolved;  and the old animosity broke forth again in all its strength.    James had during the last year of his reign, been even more hated by  the Tories than by the Whigs; and not without cause for the Whigs he was  only an enemy; and to the Tories he had been a faithless and thankless  friend. But the old royalist feeling, which had seemed to be extinct in  the time of his lawless domination, had been partially revived by his  misfortunes. Many lords and gentlemen, who had, in December, taken arms  for the Prince of Orange and a Free Parliament, muttered, two months  later, that they had been drawn in; that they had trusted too much  to His Highness's Declaration; that they had given him credit for a  disinterestedness which, it now appeared, was not in his nature. They  had meant to put on King James, for his own good, some gentle force, to  punish the Jesuits and renegades who had misled him, to obtain from  him some guarantee for the safety of the civil and ecclesiastical  institutions of the realm, but not to uncrown and banish him. For his  maladministration, gross as it had been, excuses were found. Was it  strange that, driven from his native land, while still a boy, by rebels  who were a disgrace to the Protestant name, and forced to pass his  youth in countries where the Roman Catholic religion was established,  he should have been captivated by that most attractive of all  superstitions? Was it strange that, persecuted and calumniated as he  had been by an implacable faction, his disposition should have become  sterner and more severe than it had once been thought, and that, when  those who had tried to blast his honour and to rob him of his birthright  were at length in his power, he should not have sufficiently tempered  justice with mercy? As to the worst charge which had been brought  against him, the charge of trying to cheat his daughters out of their  inheritance by fathering a supposititious child, on what grounds did it  rest? Merely on slight circumstances, such as might well be imputed to  accident, or to that imprudence which was but too much in harmony with  his character. Did ever the most stupid country justice put a boy in  the stocks without requiring stronger evidence than that on which the  English people had pronounced their King guilty of the basest and most  odious of all frauds? Some great faults he had doubtless committed,  nothing could be more just or constitutional than that for those faults  his advisers and tools should be called to a severe reckoning; nor did  any of those advisers and tools more richly deserve punishment than the  Roundhead sectaries whose adulation had encouraged him to persist in the  fatal exercise of the dispensing power. It was a fundamental law of the  land that the King could do no wrong, and that, if wrong were done by  his authority, his counsellors and agents were responsible. That great  rule, essential to our polity, was now inverted. The sycophants, who  were legally punishable, enjoyed impunity: the King, who was not legally  punishable, was punished with merciless severity. Was it possible for  the Cavaliers of England, the sons of the warriors who had fought under  Rupert, not to feel bitter sorrow and indignation when they reflected  on the fate of their rightful liege lord, the heir of a long line of  princes, lately enthroned in splendour at Whitehall, now an exile, a  suppliant, a mendicant? His calamities had been greater than even those  of the Blessed Martyr from whom he sprang. The father had been slain by  avowed and mortal foes: the ruin of the son had been the work of his  own children. Surely the punishment, even if deserved, should have been  inflicted by other hands. And was it altogether deserved? Had not the  unhappy man been rather weak and rash than wicked? Had he not some of  the qualities of an excellent prince? His abilities were certainly not  of a high order: but he was diligent: he was thrifty: he had fought  bravely: he had been his own minister for maritime affairs, and had, in  that capacity, acquitted himself respectably: he had, till his spiritual  guides obtained a fatal ascendency over his mind, been regarded as a man  of strict justice; and, to the last, when he was not misled by them, he  generally spoke truth and dealt fairly. With so many virtues he might,  if he had been a Protestant, nay, if he had been a moderate Roman  Catholic, have had a prosperous and glorious reign. Perhaps it might not  be too late for him to retrieve his errors. It was difficult to believe  that he could be so dull and perverse as not to have profited by the  terrible discipline which he had recently undergone; and, if that  discipline had produced the effects which might reasonably be expected  from it, England might still enjoy, under her legitimate ruler, a larger  measure of happiness and tranquillity than she could expect from the  administration of the best and ablest usurper.    We should do great injustice to those who held this language, if we  supposed that they had, as a body, ceased"]]]
