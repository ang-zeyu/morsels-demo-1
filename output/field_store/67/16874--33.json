Yet it is the fashion to say that we lack organising ability. This is  true, I fear, to a certain extent, of those who have been nurtured in  the new traditions. We have laboured under a terrible handicap owing to  an almost fatal departure from the Swadeshi spirit. We, the educated  classes, have received our education through a foreign tongue. We have  therefore not reacted upon the masses. We want to represent the masses,  but we fail. They recognise us not much more than they recognise the  English officers. Their hearts are an open book to neither. Their  aspirations are not ours. Hence there is a break. And you witness not in  reality failure to organise but want of correspondence between the  representatives and the represented. If during the last fifty years we  had been educated through the vernaculars, our elders and our servants  and our neighbours would have partaken of our knowledge; the discoveries  of a Bose or a Ray would have been household treasures as are the  Ramayan and the Mahabharat. As it is, so far as the masses are  concerned, those great discoveries might as well have been made by  foreigners. Had instruction in all the branches of learning been given  through the vernaculars, I make bold to say that they would have been  enriched wonderfully. The question of village sanitation, etc., would  have been solved long ago. The village panchayats would be now a living  force in a special way, and India would almost be enjoying  self-government suited to its requirements and would have been spared  the humiliating spectacle of organised assassination on its sacred soil.  It is not too late to mend. And you can help if you will, as no other  body or bodies can.    And now for the last division of Swadeshi, much of the deep poverty of  the masses is due to the ruinous departure from Swadeshi in the economic  and industrial life. If not an article of commerce had been brought from  outside India, she would be today a land flowing with milk and honey.  But that was not to be. We were greedy and so was England. The  connection between England and India was based clearly upon an error.  But she does not remain in India in error. It is her declared policy  that India is to be held in trust for her people. If this be true,  Lancashire must stand aside. And if the Swadeshi doctrine is a sound  doctrine, Lancashire can stand aside without hurt, though it may sustain  a shock for the time being. I think of Swadeshi not as a boycott  movement undertaken by way of revenge. I conceive it as religious  principle to be followed by all. I am no economist, but I have read some  treatises which show that England could easily become a self-sustained  country, growing all the produce she needs. This may be an utterly  ridiculous proposition, and perhaps the best proof that it cannot be  true, is that England is one of the largest importers in the world. But  India cannot live for Lancashire or any other country before she is able  to live for herself. And she can live for herself only if she produces  and is helped to produce everything for her requirements within her own  borders. She need not be, she ought not to be, drawn into the vertex of  mad and ruinous competition which breeds fratricide, jealousy and many  other evils. But who is to stop her great millionaires from entering  into the world competition? Certainly not legislation. Force of public  opinion, proper education, however, can do a great deal in the desired  direction. The hand-loom industry is in a dying condition. I took  special care during my wanderings last year to see as many weavers as  possible, and my heart ached to find how they had lost, how families had  retired from this once flourishing and honourable occupation. If we  follow the Swadeshi doctrine, it would be your duty and mine to find out  neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them to supply them  where they do not know how to proceed, assuming that there are  neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation. Then every village of  India will almost be a self-supporting and self-contained unit,  exchanging only such necessary commodities with other villages where  they are not locally producible. This may all sound nonsensical. Well,  India is a country of nonsense. It is nonsensical to parch one's throat  with thirst when a kindly Mahomedan is ready to offer pure water to  drink. And yet thousands of Hindus would rather die of thirst than drink  water from a Mahomedan household. These nonsensical men can also, once  they are convinced that their religion demands that they should wear  garments manufactured in India only and eat food only grown in India,  decline to wear any other clothing or eat any other food. Lord Curzon  set the fashion for tea-drinking. And that pernicious drug now bids fair  to overwhelm the nation. It has already undermined the digestive  apparatus of hundreds of thousands of men and women and constitutes an  additional tax upon their slender purses. Lord Hardinge can set the  fashion for Swadeshi, and almost the whole of India forswear foreign  goods. There is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, which, freely rendered,  means, masses follow the classes. It is easy to undo the evil if the  thinking portion of the community were to take the Swadeshi vow even  though it may, for a time, cause considerable inconvenience. I hate  legislative interference, in any department of life. At best it is the  lesser evil. But I would tolerate, welcome, indeed, plead for a stiff  protective duty upon foreign goods. Natal, a British colony, protected  its sugar by taxing the sugar that came from another British colony,  Mauritius. England has sinned against India by forcing free trade upon  her. It may have been food for her, but it has been poison for this  country.    It has often been urged that India cannot adopt Swadeshi in the economic  life at any rate. Those who advance this objection do not look upon  Swadeshi as a rule of life. With them it is a mere patriotic effort not  to be made if it involved any self-denial. Swadeshi, as defined here, is  a religious discipline to be undergone in utter disregard of the  physical discomfort it may cause to individuals. Under its spell the  deprivation of a pin or a needle, because these are not manufactured in  India, need cause no terror. A Swadeshist will learn to do without  hundreds of things which today he considers necessary. Moreover, those  who dismiss Swadeshi from their minds by arguing the impossible, forget  that Swadeshi, after all, is a goal to be reached by steady effort. And  we would be making for the goal even if we confined Swadeshi to a given  set of articles allowing ourselves as a temporary measure to use such  things as might not be procurable in the country.    There now remains for me to consider one more objection that has been  raised against Swadeshi. The objectors consider it to be a most selfish  doctrine without any warrant in the civilised code of morality. With  them to practise Swadeshi is to revert to barbarism. I cannot enter into  a detailed analysis of the position. But I would urge that Swadeshi is  the only doctrine consistent with the law of humility and love. It is  arrogance to think of launching out to serve the whole of India when I  am hardly able to serve even my own family. It were better to  concentrate my effort upon the family and consider that through them I  was serving the whole nation and, if you will, the whole of humanity.  This is humility and it is love. The motive will determine the quality  of the act. I may serve my family regardless of the sufferings I may  cause to others. As for instance, I may accept an employment which  enables me to extort money from people, I enrich myself thereby and then  satisfy many unlawful demands of the family. Here I am neither serving  the family nor the State. Or I may recognise that God has given me hands  and feet only to work with for my sustenance and for that of those who  may be dependent upon me. I would then at once simplify my life and that  of those whom I can directly reach. In this instance I would have served  the family without causing injury to anyone else. Supposing that  everyone followed this mode of life, we should have at once an ideal  state. All will not reach that state at the same time. But those of us  who, realising its truth, enforce it in practice will clearly anticipate  and accelerate the coming of that happy day. Under this plan of life, in  seeming to serve India to the exclusion of every other country I do not  harm any other country. My patriotism is both exclusive and inclusive.  It is exclusive in the sense that in all humility I confine my attention  to the land of my birth, but it is inclusive in the sense that my  service is not of a competitive or antagonistic nature. _Sic utere tuo  ut alienum non la_ is not merely a legal maxim, but it is a grand  doctrine of life. It is the key to a proper practice of Ahimsa or love.  It is for you, the custodians of a great faith, to set the fashion and  show, by your preaching, sanctified by practice, that patriotism based  on hatred \"killeth\" and that patriotism based on love \"giveth life.\"    FOOTNOTE:    [3] Address delivered before the Missionary Conference on February 14,  1916.          AHIMSA[4]      There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief that an  exaggerated practice of Ahimsa synchronises with our becoming bereft of  manly virtues. During the past 1,500 years we have, as a nation, given  ample proof of physical courage, but we have been torn by internal  dissensions and have been dominated by love of self instead of love of  country. We have, that is to say, been swayed by the spirit of  irreligion rather than of religion.

He had then returned to his father's parish and taken up the  duties of a curate. He had a thorough knowledge of the contents of the  Prayer-book, the ways of a Common Room, the conjugations of the Greek  Irregular Verbs, and the small jests of a country parsonage; and the  defects of his experience in other directions were replaced by a zeal  and a piety which were soon to prove themselves equal, and more than  equal, to whatever calls might be made upon them. The superabundance of  his piety overflowed into verse; and the holy simplicity of the  Christian Year carried his name into the remotest lodging-houses of  England.    As for his zeal, however, it needed another outlet. Looking forth upon  the doings of his fellow-men through his rectory windows in  Gloucestershire, Keble felt his whole soul shaken with loathing, anger,  and dread. Infidelity was stalking through the land; authority was  laughed at; the hideous doctrines of Democracy were being openly  preached. Worse still, if possible, the Church herself was ignorant and  lukewarm; she had forgotten the mysteries of the sacraments, she had  lost faith in the Apostolical Succession; she was no longer interested  in the Early Fathers; and she submitted herself to the control of a  secular legislature, the members of which were not even bound to profess  belief in the Atonement. In the face of such enormities what could Keble  do? He was ready to do anything, but he was a simple and an unambitious  man, and his wrath would in all probability have consumed itself  unappeased within him had he not chanced to come into contact, at the  critical moment, with a spirit more excitable and daring than his own.    Hurrell Froude, one of Keble's pupils, was a clever young man to whom  had fallen a rather larger share of self-assurance and intolerance than  even clever young men usually possess. What was singular about him,  however, was not so much his temper as his tastes. The sort of ardour  which impels more normal youths to haunt Music Halls and fall in love  with actresses took the form, in Froude's case, of a romantic devotion  to the Deity and an intense interest in the state of his own soul. He  was obsessed by the ideals of saintliness, and convinced of the supreme  importance of not eating too much. He kept a diary in which he recorded  his delinquencies, and they were many. 'I cannot say much for myself  today,' he writes on September 29th, 1826 (he was twenty-three years  old). 'I did not read the Psalms and Second Lesson after breakfast,  which I had neglected to do before, though I had plenty of time on my  hands. Would have liked to be thought adventurous for a scramble I had  at the Devil's Bridge. Looked with greediness to see if there was a  goose on the table for dinner; and though what I ate was of the plainest  sort, and I took no variety, yet even this was partly the effect of  accident, and I certainly rather exceeded in quantity, as I was fuzzy  and sleepy after dinner.' 'I allowed myself to be disgusted, with--'s  pomposity,' he writes a little later, 'also smiled at an allusion in the  Lessons to abstemiousness in eating. I hope not from pride or vanity,  but mistrust; it certainly was unintentional.' And again, 'As to my  meals, I can say that I was always careful to see that no one else would  take a thing before I served myself; and I believe as to the kind of my  food, a bit of cold endings of a dab at breakfast, and a scrap of  mackerel at dinner, are the only things that diverged from the strict  rule of simplicity.' 'I am obliged to confess,' he notes, 'that in my  intercourse with the Supreme Being, I am be come more and more  sluggish.' And then he exclaims: 'Thine eye trieth my inward parts, and  knoweth my thoughts ... Oh that my ways were made so direct that I might  keep Thy statutes. I will walk in Thy Commandments when Thou hast set my  heart at liberty.'    Such were the preoccupations of this young man. Perhaps they would have  been different, if he had had a little less of what Newman describes as  his 'high severe idea of the intrinsic excellence of Virginity'; but it  is useless to speculate.    Naturally enough the fierce and burning zeal of Keble had a profound  effect upon his mind. The two became intimate friends, and Froude,  eagerly seizing upon the doctrines of the elder man, saw to it that they  had as full a measure of controversial notoriety as an Oxford common  room could afford. He plunged the metaphysical mysteries of the Holy  Catholic Church into the atmosphere of party politics. Surprised Doctors  of Divinity found themselves suddenly faced with strange questions which  had never entered their heads before. Was the Church of England, or was  it not, a part of the Church Catholic? If it was, were not the Reformers  of the sixteenth century renegades? Was not the participation of the  Body and Blood of Christ essential to the maintenance of Christian life  and hope in each individual? Were Timothy and Titus Bishops? Or were  they not? If they were, did it not follow that the power of  administering the Holy Eucharist was the attribute of a sacred order  founded by Christ Himself? Did not the Fathers refer to the tradition of  the Church as to something independent of the written word, and  sufficient to refute heresy, even alone? Was it not, therefore, God's  unwritten word? And did it not demand the same reverence from us as the  Scriptures, and for exactly the same reason--BECAUSE IT WAS HIS WORD?  The Doctors of Divinity were aghast at such questions, which seemed to  lead they hardly knew whither; and they found it difficult to think of  very apposite answers. But Hurrell Froude supplied the answers himself  readily enough. All Oxford, all England, should know the truth. The time  was out of joint, and he was only too delighted to have been born to set  it right.    But, after all, something more was needed than even the excitement of  Froude combined with the conviction of Keble to ruffle seriously the  vast calm waters of Christian thought; and it so happened that that  thing was not wanting: it was the genius of John Henry Newman. If Newman  had never lived, or if his father, when the gig came round on the fatal  morning, still undecided between the two Universities, had chanced to  turn the horse's head in the direction of Cambridge, who can doubt that  the Oxford Movement would have flickered out its little flame unobserved  in the Common Room of Oriel? And how different, too, would have been the  fate of Newman himself! He was a child of the Romantic Revival, a  creature of emotion and of memory, a dreamer whose secret spirit dwelt  apart in delectable mountains, an artist whose subtle senses caught,  like a shower in the sunshine, the impalpable rainbow of the immaterial  world. In other times, under other skies, his days would have been more  fortunate. He might have helped to weave the garland of Meleager, or to  mix the lapis lazuli of Fra Angelico, or to chase the delicate truth in  the shade of an Athenian palaestra, or his hands might have fashioned  those ethereal faces that smile in the niches of Chartres. Even in his  own age he might, at Cambridge, whose cloisters have ever been  consecrated to poetry and common sense, have followed quietly in Gray's  footsteps and brought into flower those seeds of inspiration which now  lie embedded amid the faded devotion of the Lyra Apostolica.    At Oxford, he was doomed. He could not withstand the last enchantment of  the Middle Age. It was in vain that he plunged into the pages of Gibbon  or communed for long hours with Beethoven over his beloved violin. The  air was thick with clerical sanctity, heavy with the odours of tradition  and the soft warmth of spiritual authority; his friendship with Hurrell  Froude did the rest. All that was weakest in him hurried him onward, and  all that was strongest in him too. His curious and vaulting imagination  began to construct vast philosophical fabrics out of the writings of  ancient monks, and to dally with visions of angelic visitations and the  efficacy of the oil of St Walburga; his emotional nature became absorbed  in the partisan passions of a University clique; and his subtle  intellect concerned itself more and more exclusively with the  dialectical splitting of dogmatical hairs. His future course was marked  out for him all too clearly; and yet by a singular chance the true  nature of the man was to emerge triumphant in the end. If Newman had  died at the age of sixty, today he would have been already forgotten,  save by a few ecclesiastical historians; but he lived to write his  Apologia, and to reach immortality, neither as a thinker nor as a  theologian, but as an artist who has embalmed the poignant history of an  intensely human spirit in the magical spices of words.    When Froude succeeded in impregnating Newman with the ideas of Keble,  the Oxford Movement began. The original and remarkable characteristic of  these three men was that they took the Christian Religion au pied de la  lettre. This had not been done in England for centuries. When they  declared every Sunday that they believed in the Holy Catholic Church,  they meant it. When they repeated the Athanasian Creed, they meant it.  Even, when they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles, they meant it-or  at least they thought they did. Now such a state of mind was  dangerous--more dangerous indeed--than they at first realised. They had  started with the innocent assumption that the Christian Religion was  contained in the doctrines of the Church of England; but, the more they  examined this matter, the more difficult and dubious it became. The  Church of England bore everywhere upon it the signs of human  imperfection; it was the outcome of revolution and of compromise, of the  exigencies of politicians and the caprices of princes, of the prejudices  of theologians and the necessities"]]]
