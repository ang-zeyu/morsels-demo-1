Let the  greater revolutions be retained, but the lesser, of horoscopes and  houses, be rejected--the former being like ordnance which shoot to a  great distance, whilst the other are but like small bows, that do no  execution. 2. The celestial operations affect not all kinds of bodies,  but only the more sensible, as humours, air, and spirits. 3. All the  celestial operations rather extend to masses of things than to  individuals, though they may obliquely reach some individuals also which  are more sensible than the rest, as a pestilent constitution of the air  affects those bodies which are least able to resist it. 4. All the  celestial operations produce not their effects instantaneously, and in a  narrow compass, but exert them in large portions of time and space. Thus  predictions as to the temperature of a year may hold good, but not with  regard to single days. 5. There is no fatal necessity in the stars; and  this the more prudent astrologers have constantly allowed. 6. We will  add one thing more, which, if amended and improved, might make for  astrology--viz. that we are certain the celestial bodies have other  influences besides heat and light, but these influences act not  otherwise than by the foregoing rules, though they lie so deep in  physics as to require a fuller explanation. So that, upon the whole, we  must register as needed,[6] an astrology written in conformity with  these principles, under the name of _Astrologia Sana_.'    He then proceeds to show what this just astrology should comprehend--as,  1, the doctrine of the commixture of rays; 2, the effect of nearest  approaches and farthest removes of planets to and from the point  overhead (the planets, like the sun, having their summer and winter); 3,  the effects of distance, 'with a proper enquiry into what the vigour of  the planets may perform of itself, and what through their nearness to  us; for,' he adds, but unfortunately without assigning any reason for  the statement, 'a planet is more brisk when most remote, but more  communicative when nearest;' 4, the other accidents of the planet's  motions as they pursue      Their wand'ring course, now high, now low, then hid,    Progressive, retrograde, or standing still;    5, all that can be discovered of the general nature of the planets and  fixed stars, considered in their own essence and activity; 6, lastly,  let this just astrology, he says, 'contain, from tradition, the  particular natures and alterations of the planets and fixed stars; for'  (here is a reason indeed) 'as these are delivered with general consent,  they are not lightly to be rejected, unless they directly contradict  physical considerations. Of such observations let a just astrology be  formed; and according to these alone should schemes of the heavens be  made and interpreted.'    The astrology thus regarded by Bacon as sane and just did not differ, as  to its primary object, from the false systems which now seem to us so  absurd. 'Let this astrology be used with greater confidence in  prediction,' says Bacon, 'but more cautiously in election, and in both  cases with due moderation. Thus predictions may be made of comets, and  all kinds of meteors, inundations, droughts, heats, frosts, earthquakes,  fiery eruptions, winds, great rains, the seasons of the year, plagues,  epidemic diseases, plenty, famine, wars, seditions, sects,  transmigrations of people, and all commotions, or great innovations of  things, natural and civil. Predictions may possibly be made more  particular, though with less certainty, if, when the general tendencies  of the times are found, a good philosophical or political judgment  applies them to such things as are most liable to accidents of this  kind. For example, from a foreknowledge of the seasons of any year, they  might be apprehended more destructive to olives than grapes, more  hurtful in distempers of the lungs than the liver, more pernicious to  the inhabitants of hills than valleys, and, for want of provisions, to  monks than courtiers, etc. Or if any one, from a knowledge of the  influence which the celestial bodies have upon the spirits of mankind,  should find it would affect the people more than their rulers, learned  and inquisitive men more than the military, etc. For there are  innumerable things of this kind that require not only a general  knowledge gained from the stars which are the agents, but also a  particular one of the passive subjects. Nor are elections to be wholly  rejected, though not so much to be trusted as predictions; for we find  in planting, sowing, and grafting, observations of the moon are not  absolutely trifling, and there are many particulars of this kind. But  elections are more to be curbed by our rules than predictions; and this  must always be remembered, that election only holds in such cases where  the virtue of the heavenly bodies, and the action of the inferior bodies  also, is not transient, as in the examples just mentioned; for the  increases of the moon and planets are not sudden things. But punctuality  of time should here be absolutely rejected. And perhaps there are more  of these instances to be found in civil matters than some would  imagine.'    The method of inquiry suggested by Bacon as proper for determining the  just rules of the astrology he advocated, was, as might be expected,  chiefly inductive. There are, said he, 'but four ways of arriving at  this science, viz.--1, by future experiments; 2, past experiments; 3,  traditions; 4, physical reasons.' But he was not very hopeful as to the  progress of the suggested researches. It is vain, he said, to think at  present of future experiments, because many ages are required to procure  a competent stock of them. As for the past, it is true that past  experiments are within our reach, 'but it is a work of labour and much  time to procure them. Thus astrologers may, if they please, draw from  real history all greater accidents, as inundations, plagues, wars,  seditions, deaths of kings, etc., as also the positions of the celestial  bodies, not according to fictitious horoscopes, but the above-mentioned  rules of their revolutions, or such as they really were at the time,  and, when the event conspires, erect a probable rule of prediction.'  Traditions would require to be carefully sifted, and those thrown out  which manifestly clashed with physical considerations, leaving those in  full force which complied with such considerations. Lastly, the physical  reasons worthiest of being enquired into are those, said Bacon, 'which  search into the universal appetites and passions of matter, and the  simple genuine motions of the heavenly bodies.'    It is evident there was much which, in our time at least, would be  regarded as wild and fanciful in the 'sound and just astrology'  advocated by Bacon. Yet, in passing, it may be noticed that even in our  own time we have seen similar ideas promulgated, not by common  astrologers and fortune-tellers (who, indeed, know nothing about such  matters), but by persons supposed to be well-informed in matters  scientific. In a roundabout way, a new astrology has been suggested,  which is not at all unlike Bacon's 'astrologia sana,' though not based,  as he proposed that astrology should be, on experiment, or tradition, or  physical reasons. It has been suggested, first, that the seasons of our  earth are affected by the condition of the sun in the matter of spots,  and very striking evidence has been collected to show that this must be  the case. For instance, it has been found that years when the sun has  been free from spots have been warmer than the average; and it has also  been found that such years have been cooler than the average: a  double-shotted argument wholly irresistible, especially when it is also  found that when the sun has many spots the weather has sometimes been  exceptionally warm and sometimes exceptionally cold. If this be not  considered sufficient, then note that in one country or continent or  hemisphere the weather, when the sun is most spotted (or least, as the  case may be), may be singularly hot, while in another country,  continent, or hemisphere, the weather may be as singularly cold. So with  wind and calm, rain and drought, and so forth. Always, whether the sun  is very much spotted or quite free from spots, something unusual in the  way of weather must be going on somewhere, demonstrating in the most  significant way the influence of sun-spots or the want of sun-spots on  the weather. It is true that captious minds might say that this method  of reasoning proved too much in many ways, as, for example,  thus--always, whether the sun is very much spotted or quite free from  spots, some remarkable event, as a battle, massacre, domestic tragedy on  a large scale, or the like, may be going on, demonstrating in the most  significant way the influence of sun-spots or the want of sun-spots on  the passions of men--which sounds absurd. But the answer is twofold.  First, such reasoning is captious, and secondly, it is not certain that  sun-spots, or the want of them, may not influence human passions; it may  be worth while to enquire into this possible solar influence as well as  the other, which can be done by crossing the hands of the new  fortune-tellers with a sufficient amount of that precious metal which  astrologers have in all ages dedicated to the sun.    That the new system of divination is not solely solar, but partly  planetary also, is seen when we remember that the sun-spots wax and wane  in periods of time which are manifestly referable to the planetary  motions. Thus, the great solar spot-period lasts about eleven years, the  successive spotless epochs being separated on the average by about that  time; and so nearly does this period agree with the period of the planet  Jupiter's revolution around the sun, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558"],[0,"Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking (#3)"],[1,"hot  cheese sauce.
