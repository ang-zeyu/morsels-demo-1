I believe I have found him. I discharged the last boy because he  lied to me about some trifling offence for which I would have forgiven  him if he had told the truth. I can bear with incompetency, but  falsehood and deceit I cannot and will not tolerate,\" he said, so  sternly that Dan's face paled. \"I am convinced that you are incapable  of either. Will you take the place, Dan?\"    \"I will if you think I can fill it, sir. I will do my best.\"    \"Yes, I believe you will. Perhaps I know more about you than you  think. Businessmen must keep their eyes open. We'll regard this matter  as settled then. Come up tomorrow at eight o'clock. And one word more,  Dan. You have perhaps heard that I am an unjust and hard master. I am  not the former, and you will never have occasion to find me the latter  if you are always as truthful and straightforward as you have been  today. You might easily have deceived me in this matter. That you did  not do so is the best and only recommendation I require. Take those  trout up to my house and leave them. That will do. Good afternoon.\"    Dan somehow got his dazed self through the glass door and out of the  building. The whole interview had been such a surprise to him that he  was hardly sure whether or not he had dreamed it all.    \"I feel as if I were some person else,\" he said to himself, as he  started down the hot white road. \"But Mother was right. I'll stick to  her motto. I wonder what Sam will say to this.\"          A Christmas Inspiration      \"Well, I really think Santa Claus has been very good to us all,\" said  Jean Lawrence, pulling the pins out of her heavy coil of fair hair and  letting it ripple over her shoulders.    \"So do I,\" said Nellie Preston as well as she could with a mouthful of  chocolates. \"Those blessed home folks of mine seem to have divined by  instinct the very things I most wanted.\"    It was the dusk of Christmas Eve and they were all in Jean Lawrence's  room at No. 16 Chestnut Terrace. No. 16 was a boarding-house, and  boarding-houses are not proverbially cheerful places in which to spend  Christmas, but Jean's room, at least, was a pleasant spot, and all the  girls had brought their Christmas presents in to show each other.  Christmas came on Sunday that year and the Saturday evening mail at  Chestnut Terrace had been an exciting one.    Jean had lighted the pink-globed lamp on her table and the mellow  light fell over merry faces as the girls chatted about their gifts. On  the table was a big white box heaped with roses that betokened a bit  of Christmas extravagance on somebody's part. Jean's brother had sent  them to her from Montreal, and all the girls were enjoying them in  common.    No. 16 Chestnut Terrace was overrun with girls generally. But just now  only five were left; all the others had gone home for Christmas, but  these five could not go and were bent on making the best of it.    Belle and Olive Reynolds, who were sitting on the bed--Jean could  never keep them off it--were High School girls; they were said to be  always laughing, and even the fact that they could not go home for  Christmas because a young brother had measles did not dampen their  spirits.    Beth Hamilton, who was hovering over the roses, and Nellie Preston,  who was eating candy, were art students, and their homes were too far  away to visit. As for Jean Lawrence, she was an orphan, and had no  home of her own. She worked on the staff of one of the big city  newspapers and the other girls were a little in awe of her  cleverness, but her nature was a \"chummy\" one and her room was a  favourite rendezvous. Everybody liked frank, open-handed and hearted  Jean.    \"It was so funny to see the postman when he came this evening,\" said  Olive. \"He just bulged with parcels. They were sticking out in every  direction.\"    \"We all got our share of them,\" said Jean with a sigh of content.    \"Even the cook got six--I counted.\"    \"Miss Allen didn't get a thing--not even a letter,\" said Beth quickly.  Beth had a trick of seeing things that other girls didn't.    \"I forgot Miss Allen. No, I don't believe she did,\" answered Jean  thoughtfully as she twisted up her pretty hair. \"How dismal it must be  to be so forlorn as that on Christmas Eve of all times. Ugh! I'm glad  I have friends.\"    \"I saw Miss Allen watching us as we opened our parcels and letters,\"  Beth went on. \"I happened to look up once, and such an expression as  was on her face, girls! It was pathetic and sad and envious all at  once. It really made me feel bad--for five minutes,\" she concluded  honestly.    \"Hasn't Miss Allen any friends at all?\" asked Beth.    \"No, I don't think she has,\" answered Jean. \"She has lived here for  fourteen years, so Mrs. Pickrell says. Think of that, girls! Fourteen  years at Chestnut Terrace! Is it any wonder that she is thin and  dried-up and snappy?\"    \"Nobody ever comes to see her and she never goes anywhere,\" said Beth.  \"Dear me! She must feel lonely now when everybody else is being  remembered by their friends. I can't forget her face tonight; it  actually haunts me. Girls, how would you feel if you hadn't anyone  belonging to you, and if nobody thought about you at Christmas?\"    \"Ow!\" said Olive, as if the mere idea made her shiver.    A little silence followed. To tell the truth, none of them liked Miss  Allen. They knew that she did not like them either, but considered  them frivolous and pert, and complained when they made a racket.    \"The skeleton at the feast,\" Jean called her, and certainly the  presence of the pale, silent, discontented-looking woman at the No. 16  table did not tend to heighten its festivity.    Presently Jean said with a dramatic flourish, \"Girls, I have an  inspiration--a Christmas inspiration!\"    \"What is it?\" cried four voices.    \"Just this. Let us give Miss Allen a Christmas surprise. She has not  received a single present and I'm sure she feels lonely. Just think  how we would feel if we were in her place.\"    \"That is true,\" said Olive thoughtfully. \"Do you know, girls, this  evening I went to her room with a message from Mrs. Pickrell, and I do  believe she had been crying. Her room looked dreadfully bare and  cheerless, too. I think she is very poor. What are we to do, Jean?\"    \"Let us each give her something nice. We can put the things just  outside of her door so that she will see them whenever she opens it.  I'll give her some of Fred's roses too, and I'll write a Christmassy  letter in my very best style to go with them,\" said Jean, warming up  to her ideas as she talked.    The other girls caught her spirit and entered into the plan with  enthusiasm.    \"Splendid!\" cried Beth. \"Jean, it is an inspiration, sure enough.  Haven't we been horribly selfish--thinking of nothing but our own  gifts and fun and pleasure? I really feel ashamed.\"    \"Let us do the thing up the very best way we can,\" said Nellie,  forgetting even her beloved chocolates in her eagerness. \"The shops  are open yet. Let us go up town and invest.\"    Five minutes later five capped and jacketed figures were scurrying up  the street in the frosty, starlit December dusk. Miss Allen in her  cold little room heard their gay voices and sighed. She was crying by  herself in the dark. It was Christmas for everybody but her, she  thought drearily.    In an hour the girls came back with their purchases.    \"Now, let's hold a council of war,\" said Jean jubilantly. \"I hadn't  the faintest idea what Miss Allen would like so I just guessed wildly.  I got her a lace handkerchief and a big bottle of perfume and a  painted photograph frame--and I'll stick my own photo in it for fun.  That was really all I could afford. Christmas purchases have left my  purse dreadfully lean.\"    \"I got her a glove-box and a pin tray,\" said Belle, \"and Olive got her  a calendar and Whittier's poems. And besides we are going to give her  half of that big plummy fruit cake Mother sent us from home. I'm sure  she hasn't tasted anything so delicious for years, for fruit cakes  don't grow on Chestnut Terrace and she never goes anywhere else for a  meal.\"    Beth had bought a pretty cup and saucer and said she meant to give one  of her pretty water-colours too. Nellie, true to her reputation, had  invested in a big box of chocolate creams, a gorgeously striped candy  cane, a bag of oranges, and a brilliant lampshade of rose-coloured  crepe paper to top off with.    \"It makes such a lot of show for the money,\" she explained. \"I am  bankrupt, like Jean.\"    \"Well, we've got a lot of pretty things,\" said Jean in a tone of  satisfaction. \"Now we must do them up nicely. Will you wrap them in  tissue paper, girls, and tie them with baby ribbon--here's a box of  it--while I write that letter?\"    While the others chatted over their parcels Jean wrote her letter, and  Jean could write delightful letters. She had a decided talent in that  respect, and her correspondents all declared her letters to be things  of beauty and joy forever. She put her best into Miss Allen's  Christmas letter. Since then she has written many bright and clever  things, but I do not believe she ever in her life wrote anything more  genuinely original and delightful than that letter. Besides, it  breathed the very spirit of Christmas, and all the girls declared that  it was splendid.    \"You must all sign it now,\" said Jean, \"and I'll put it in one of  those big envelopes; and, Nellie, won't you write her name on it in  fancy letters?\"    Which Nellie proceeded to do, and furthermore embellished the envelope  by a border of chubby cherubs, dancing hand in hand around it and a  sketch of No. 16 Chestnut Terrace in the corner in lieu of a stamp.  Not content with this she hunted out a huge sheet of drawing paper and  drew upon it an original pen-and-ink design after her own heart.

Never marry a woman with a family nose, son.\"    A woman with a family nose came into the library at this juncture and  beamed maternally upon them both. \"There's a bite for you in the  dining room. After you've eaten it you must dress. Mind you brush your  hair well down, Father. The green room is ready for you, Selwyn.  Tomorrow I'll have a good talk with you, but tonight I'll be too busy  to remember you're around. How are we all going to get over to  Wish-ton-wish? Leo and Bertha are going in the pony carriage. It won't  hold a third passenger. You'll have to squeeze in with Father and me  in the buggy, Selwyn.\"    \"By no means,\" replied Selwyn briskly. \"I'll walk over to  Wish-ton-wish. Ifs only half a mile across lots. I suppose the old way  is still open?\"    \"It ought to be,\" answered Mr. Grant drily; \"Leo has kept it well  trodden. If you've forgotten how it runs he can tell you.\"    \"I haven't forgotten,\" said Selwyn, a little brusquely. He had his own  reasons for remembering the wood path. Leo had not been the first  Grant to go courting to Wish-ton-wish.    When he started, the moon was rising round and red and hazy in an  eastern hill-gap. The autumn air was mild and spicy. Long shadows  stretched across the fields on his right and silvery mosaics patterned  the floor of the old beechwood lane. Selwyn walked slowly. He was  thinking of Esme Graham or, rather, of the girl who had been Esme  Graham, and wondering if he would see her at the wedding. It was  probable, and he did not want to see her. In spite of ten years'  effort, he did not think he could yet look upon Tom St. Clair's wife  with the proper calm indifference. At the best, it would taint his own  memory of her; he would never again be able to think of her as Esme  Graham but only as Esme St. Clair.    The Grahams had come to Wish-ton-wish eleven years before. There was a  big family of girls of whom the tall, brown-haired Esme was the  oldest. There was one summer during which Selwyn Grant had haunted  Wish-ton-wish, the merry comrade of the younger girls, the boyishly,  silently devoted lover of Esme. Tom St. Clair had always been there  too, in his right as second cousin, Selwyn had supposed. One day he  found out that Tom and Esme had been engaged ever since she was  sixteen; one of her sisters told him. That had been all. He had gone  away soon after, and some time later a letter from home made casual  mention of Tom St. Clair's marriage.    He narrowly missed being late for the wedding ceremony. The bridal  party entered the parlour at Wish-ton-wish at the same moment as he  slipped in by another door. Selwyn almost whistled with amazement at  sight of the bride. _That_ Alice Graham, that tall, stately, blushing  young woman, with her masses of dead-black hair, frosted over by the  film of wedding veil! Could that be the scrawny little tomboy of ten  years ago? She looked not unlike Esme, with that subtle family  resemblance that is quite independent of feature and colouring.    Where was Esme? Selwyn cast his eyes furtively over the assembled  guests while the minister read the marriage ceremony. He recognized  several of the Graham girls but he did not see Esme, although Tom St.  Clair, stout and florid and prosperous-looking, was standing on a  chair in a faraway corner, peering over the heads of the women.    After the turmoil of handshakings and congratulations, Selwyn fled to  the cool, still outdoors, where the rosy glow of Chinese lanterns  mingled with the waves of moonshine to make fairyland. And there he  met her, as she came out of the house by a side door, a tall, slender  woman in some glistening, clinging garment, with white flowers shining  like stars in the coils of her brown hair. In the soft glow she looked  even more beautiful than in the days of her girlhood, and Selwyn's  heart throbbed dangerously at sight of her.    \"Esme!\" he said involuntarily.    She started, and he had an idea that she changed colour, although it  was too dim to be sure. \"Selwyn!\" she exclaimed, putting out her  hands. \"Why, Selwyn Grant! Is it really you? Or are you such stuff as  dreams are made of? I did not know you were here. I did not know you  were home.\"    He caught her hands and held them tightly, drawing her a little closer  to him, forgetting that she was Tom St. Clair's wife, remembering only  that she was the woman to whom he had given all his love and life's  devotion, to the entire beggaring of his heart.    \"I reached home only four hours ago, and was haled straightway here to  Leo's wedding. I'm dizzy, Esme. I can't adjust my old conceptions to  this new state of affairs all at once. It seems ridiculous to think  that Leo and Alice are married. I'm sure they can't be really grown  up.\"    Esme laughed as she drew away her hands. \"We are all ten years older,\"  she said lightly.    \"Not you. You are more beautiful than ever, Esme. That sunflower  compliment is permissible in an old friend, isn't it?\"    \"This mellow glow is kinder to me than sunlight now. I am thirty, you  know, Selwyn.\"    \"And I have some grey hairs,\" he confessed. \"I knew I had them but I  had a sneaking hope that other folks didn't until Leo destroyed it  today. These young brothers and sisters who won't stay children are  nuisances. You'll be telling me next thing that 'Baby' is grown up.\"    \"'Baby' is eighteen and has a beau,\" laughed Esme. \"And I give you  fair warning that she insists on being called Laura now. Do you want  to come for a walk with me--down under the beeches to the old lane  gate? I came out to see if the fresh air would do my bit of a headache  good. I shall have to help with the supper later on.\"    They went slowly across the lawn and turned into a dim, moonlight lane  beyond, their old favourite ramble. Selwyn felt like a man in a dream,  a pleasant dream from which he dreads to awaken. The voices and  laughter echoing out from the house died away behind them and the  great silence of the night fell about them as they came to the old  gate, beyond which was a range of shining, moonlight-misted fields.    For a little while neither of them spoke. The woman looked out across  the white spaces and the man watched the glimmering curve of her neck  and the soft darkness of her rich hair. How virginal, how sacred, she  looked! The thought of Tom St. Clair was a sacrilege.    \"It's nice to see you again, Selwyn,\" said Esme frankly at last.  \"There are so few of our old set left, and so many of the babies grown  up. Sometimes I don't know my own world, it has changed so. It's an  uncomfortable feeling. You give me a pleasant sensation of really  belonging here. I'd be lonesome tonight if I dared. I'm going to miss  Alice so much. There will be only Mother and Baby and I left now. Our  family circle has dwindled woefully.\"    \"Mother and Baby and you!\" Selwyn felt his head whirling again. \"Why,  where is Tom?\"    He felt that it was an idiotic question, but it slipped from his  tongue before he could catch it. Esme turned her head and looked at  him wonderingly. He knew that in the sunlight her eyes were as mistily  blue as early meadow violets, but here they looked dark and  unfathomably tender.    \"Tom?\" she said perplexedly. \"Do you mean Tom St. Clair? He is here,  of course, he and his wife. Didn't you see her? That pretty woman in  pale pink, Lil Meredith. Why, you used to know Lil, didn't you? One of  the Uxbridge Merediths?\"    To the day of his death Selwyn Grant will firmly believe that if he  had not clutched fast hold of the top bar of the gate he would have  tumbled down on the moss under the beeches in speechless astonishment.  All the surprises of that surprising evening were as nothing to this.  He had a swift conviction that there were no words in the English  language that could fully express his feelings and that it would be a  waste of time to try to find any. Therefore he laid hold of the first  baldly commonplace ones that came handy and said tamely, \"I thought  you were married to Tom.\"    \"You--thought--I--was--married--to--Tom!\" repeated Esme slowly. \"And  have you thought _that_ all these years, Selwyn Grant?\"    \"Yes, I have. Is it any wonder? You were engaged to Tom when I went  away, Jenny told me you were. And a year later Bertha wrote me a  letter in which she made some reference to Tom's marriage. She didn't  say to _whom_, but hadn't I the right to suppose it was to you?\"    \"Oh!\" The word was partly a sigh and partly a little cry of  long-concealed, long-denied pain. \"It's been all a funny  misunderstanding. Tom and I _were_ engaged once--a boy-and-girl affair  in the beginning. Then we both found out that we had made a  mistake--that what we had thought was love was merely the affection of  good comrades. We broke our engagement shortly before you went away.  All the older girls knew it was broken but I suppose nobody mentioned  the matter to Jen. She was such a child, we never thought about her.  And you've thought I was Tom's wife all this time? It's--funny.\"    \"Funny. You mean tragic! Look here, Esme, I'm not going to risk any  more misunderstanding. There's nothing for it but plain talk when  matters get to such a state as this. I love you--and I've loved you  ever since I met you. I went away because I could not stay here and  see you married to another man. I've stayed away for the same reason.  Esme, is it too late? Did you ever care anything for me?\"    \"Yes, I did,\" she said slowly.    \"Do you care still?\" he asked.    She hid her face against his shoulder. \"Yes,\" she whispered.    \"Then we'll go back to the house and be married,\" he said joyfully.    Esme broke away and stared at him. \"Married!\"    \"Yes, married. We've wasted ten years and we're not going to waste  another minute. We're _not_, I say.\"    \"Selwyn! It's impossible.\"    \"I have expurgated that word from my dictionary. It's the very  simplest thing when you look at it in an unprejudiced way. Here is a"]]]
