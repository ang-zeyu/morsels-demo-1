The strong, vindictive spirit of his race was soon roused to the  pitch of fury, and liberty became only desired for one object.  That was  revenge,--revenge on the man who, instead of releasing him from his  imprisonment, only exulted in its continuance.    The Bushman had not been injured in falling into the pit, as may be  supposed.  After fully comprehending the manner in which his amusement  had been so suddenly brought to a termination, his first thought was to  extricate himself, without asking assistance from the man who had  furnished him with the fun.  His pride would be greatly mortified should  the Kaffir get out of his pit, and find him in the other.  That would be  a humiliating rencontre.    In silence, therefore, he listened to Congo's cries for assistance,  while at the same time doing all in his power to extricate himself.  He  tried to pull up a sharp-pointed stake that stood in the bottom of the  pit.  This piece of timber had been placed there for the purpose of  impaling and killing the hippopotamus or elephant that should drop down  upon it; and had the Bushman succeeded in taking it from the place where  it had been planted, he might have used it in working his own way to the  surface of the earth.  This object, however, he was unable to  accomplish, and his mind became diverted to another idea.    Swartboy had a system of logic, not wholly peculiar to himself, by which  he was enabled to discover that there must be some first cause for his  being in a place from which he could not escape.  That cause was no  other than Congo.  Had the Kaffir not fallen into a pit, Swartboy was  quite certain that he would have escaped the similar calamity.    He would have liberated Congo from his confinement, and perhaps  sympathised with his misfortune, after the first ebullitions of his  mirth had been exhausted; but now, on being entrapped himself, he was  only conscious that some one was to blame for the disagreeable incident,  and was unable to admit that this some one was himself.  The mishap had  befallen him in company with the Kaffir.  It was that individual's  misfortune that had conducted to his own, and this was another reason  why he now submitted to his captivity in profound silence.    Unlike Congo, he did not experience the soul-harrowing thought of being  neglected, and could therefore endure his confinement with some degree  of patience not possible to his companion.  Moreover, he had the hope of  speedy deliverance, which to Congo was denied.    He knew that Arend would soon return to the camp with the stray horse,  and miss them.  The water-vessel would also be missed, and a search  would be made for it in the right direction.  No doubt Arend, seeing  that the bucket was taken away from the camp, and finding that they did  not return, would come toward the drift,--the only place where water  could be dipped up.  In doing so he must pass within sight of the pits.  With this calculation, therefore, Swartboy could reconcile himself to  patience and silence, whereas the Kaffir had no such consolatory data to  reflect upon.        CHAPTER FOUR.    IN THE PITS.    As time passed on, however, and Swartboy saw that the sun was  descending, and that the shades of night would soon be gathering over  the river, his hopes began to sink within him.  He could not understand  why the young hunter had not long ago come to release them.  Groot  Willem, Hendrik, and Hans should have returned by that time; and the  four should have made an effectual search for their missing servants.  He had remained silent for a long time, under very peculiar  circumstances.  But silence now became unbearable, and he was seized  with a sudden desire to express his dissatisfaction at the manner Fate  had been dealing out events,--a desire no longer to be resisted.  The  silence was at last broken by his calling out--    \"Congo, you ole fool, where are you?  What for don't you go home?\"    On the Kaffir's ear the voice fell dull and distant; and yet he  immediately understood whence it came.  Like himself, the Bushman was in  a living grave!  That explained his neglect to render the long-desired  assistance.    \"Lor', Swart! why I waiting for you,\" answered Congo, for the first time  since his imprisonment attempting a smile; \"I don't want to go to the  camp and leave you behind me.\"    \"You think a big sight too much of yourself,\" rejoined the Bushman.  \"Who wants to be near such a black ole fool as you?  You may go back to  the camp, and when you get there jus' tell Baas Hendrik that Swartboy  wants to see him.  I've got something particular to tell him.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the Kaffir, becoming more reconciled to his  position; \"what for you want see Baas Hendrik?  I'll tell him what you  want without making him come here.  What shall I say?\"    In answer to this question, Swartboy made a long speech, in which the  Kaffir was requested to report himself as a fool for having fallen into  a pit,--that he had shown himself more stupid than the sea-cows, that  had apparently shunned the trap for years.    On being requested to explain how one was more stupid than the other,--  both having met with the same mischance,--Swartboy went on to prove that  his misfortune was wholly owing to the fault of Congo, by the Kaffir  having committed the first folly of allowing himself to be entrapped.    Nothing, to the Bushman's mind, could be more clear than that Congo's  stupidity in falling into the first pit had led to his own downfall into  the second.    This was now a source of much consolation to him, and the verbal  expression of his wrongs enabled him for a while to feel rather happy at  the fine opportunity afforded for reviling his rival.  The amusement,  however, could not prevent his thoughts from returning to the positive  facts that he was imprisoned; that in place of passing the day in  cooking and eating _duyker_, he had been fasting and fretting in a dark,  dirty pit, in the companionship of loathsome reptiles.    His mind now expanding under the exercise of a startled imagination, he  became apprehensive.  What if some accident should have occurred to  Arend, and prevented his return to the camp?  What if Groot Willem and  the others should have strayed, and not find their way back to the place  for two or three days?  He had heard of such events happening to other  stupid white men, and why not to them?  What if they had met a tribe of  the savage inhabitants of the country, and been killed or taken  prisoners?    These conjectures, and a thousand others, flitted through the brain of  the Bushman, all guiding to the conclusion that, should either of them  prove correct, he would first have to eat the reptiles in the pit, and  then starve.    It was no consolation to him to think that his rival in the other pit  would have to submit to a similar fate.    His unpleasant reveries were interrupted by a short, angry bark; and,  looking up to the opening through which he had descended, he beheld the  countenance of a wild dog,--the \"wilde honden\" of the Dutch Boers.    Uttering another and a different cry, the animal started back; and from  the sounds now heard overhead, the Bushman was certain that it was  accompanied by many others of its kind.    An instinctive fear of man led them to retreat for a short distance; but  they soon found out that \"the wicked flee when no man pursueth,\" and  they returned.    They were hungry, and had the sense to know that the enemy they had  discovered was, for some reason, unable to molest them.    Approaching nearer, and more near, they again gathered around the pits,  and saw that food was waiting for them at the bottom of both.  They  could contemplate their victims unharmed, and this made them courageous  enough to think of an attack.  The human voice and the gaze of human  eyes had lost their power, and the pack of wild hounds, counting several  score, began to think of taking some steps towards satisfying their  hunger.    They commenced scratching and tearing away the covering of the pits,  sending down a shower of dust, sand, and grass that nearly suffocated  the two men imprisoned beneath.    The poles supporting the screen of earth were rotten with age, and the  whole scaffolding threatened to come down as the wild dogs scampered  over it.    \"If there should be a shower of dogs,\" thought Swartboy, \"I hope that  fool Congo will have his share of it.\"    This hope was immediately realised, for the next instant he heard the  howling of one of the animals evidently down in the adjoining pit.  It  had fallen through, but, fortunately for Congo, not without injuring  itself in a way that he had but narrowly escaped.  The dog had got  transfixed on the sharp-pointed stake, planted firmly in the centre of  the pit, and was now hanging on it in horrible agony, unable to get  clear.    Without lying down in the mud, the Kaffir was unable to keep his face  more than twelve inches from the open jaws of the dog, that in its  struggles spun round as on a pivot; and Congo had to press close against  the side of the pit, to keep out of the reach of the creature yelping in  his ears.    Swartboy could distinguish the utterances of this dog from those of its  companions above, and the interpretation he gave to them was, that a  fierce combat was taking place between it and the Kaffir.    The jealousy and petty ill-will so often exhibited by the Bushman was  not so strong as he had himself believed.  His intense anxiety to know  which was getting the best of the fight, added to the fear that Congo  was being torn to pieces, told him that his friendship for the Kaffir  far outweighed the animosity he fancied himself to have felt.    The fiendish yells of the dogs, the unpleasant situation in which he was  placed, and the uncertainty of the time he was to endure it, were  well-nigh driving him distracted; when just then the wild honden  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#3)"],[1,"was made to  slant up toward the first. And when he thought that they were both deep  enough he would set his teeth firmly in the wood between them, and pull  and jerk and twist at it until he had wrenched out a chip--a chip  perhaps two inches long, and from an eighth to a quarter of an inch  thick. He would make bigger ones when he grew to be bigger himself, but  you mustn't expect too much at first. Chip after chip was torn out in  this way, and gradually he would work around the tree until he had  completely encircled it. Then the groove was made deeper, and after a  while it would have to be broadened so that he could get his head  farther into it. He seemed to think it was of immense importance to get  the job done as quickly as possible, for he worked away with tremendous  energy and eagerness, as if felling that tree was the only thing in the  world that was worth doing. Once in a while he would pause for a moment  to feel of it with his hands, and to glance up at the top to see whether  it was getting ready to fall, and several times he stopped long enough  to take a refreshing dip in the pond; but he always hurried back, and  pitched in again harder than ever. In fact, he sometimes went at it so  impetuously that he slipped and rolled over on his back. Little by  little he dug away the tree's flesh until there was nothing left but its  heart, and at last it began to crack and rend. The Beaver jumped aside  to get out of the way, and hundreds and hundreds of small, tender  branches, and delicious little twigs and buds came crashing down where  he could cut them off and eat them or carry them away at his leisure.    And so the citizens labored, and their labor brought its rich reward,  and everybody was busy and contented, and life was decidedly worth  living.    But one black November night our hero's father, the wisest old beaver in  all the town, went out to his work and never came home again. A trapper  had found the rebuilt city--a scientific trapper who had studied his  profession for years, and who knew just how to go to work. He kept away  from the lodges as long as he could, so as not to frighten anyone; and  before he set a single trap he looked the ground over very carefully,  located the different trails that ran back from the water's edge toward  the timber, visited the stumps of the felled trees, and paid particular  attention to the tooth-marks on the chips. No two beavers leave marks  that are exactly alike. The teeth of one are flatter or rounder than  those of another, while a third has large or small nicks in the edges of  his yellow chisels; and each tooth leaves its own peculiar signature  behind it. By noting all these things the trapper concluded that a  particular runway in the wet, grassy margin of the pond was the one by  which a certain old beaver always left the water in going to his night's  labor. That beaver, he decided, would best be the first one taken, for  he was probably the head of a family, and an elderly person of much  wisdom and experience; and if one of his children should be caught first  he might become alarmed, and take the lead in a general exodus.    So the trapper set a heavy double-spring trap in the edge of the water  at the foot of the runway, and covered it with a thin sheet of moss.  And that night, as the old beaver came swimming up to the shore, he put  his foot down where he shouldn't, and two steel jaws flew up and clasped  him around the thigh. He had felt that grip before. Was not half of his  right hand gone, and three toes from his left hind foot? But this was a  far more serious matter than either of those adventures. It was not a  hand that was caught this time, nor yet a toe, or toes. It was his right  hind leg, well up toward his body, and the strongest beaver that ever  lived could not have pulled himself free. Now when a beaver is  frightened, he of course makes for deep water. There, he thinks, no  enemy can follow him; and, what is more, it is the highway to his lodge,  and to the burrow that he has hollowed in the bank for a refuge in case  his house should be attacked. So this beaver turned and jumped back into  the water the way he had come; but, alas! he took his enemy with him.  The heavy trap dragged him to the bottom like a stone, and the short  chain fastened to a stake kept him from going very far toward home. For  a few minutes he struggled with all his might, and the soft black mud  rose about him in inky clouds. Then he quieted down and lay very, very  still; and the next day the trapper came along and pulled him out by  the chain.    Something else happened the same night. Another wise old beaver, the  head man of another lodge, was killed by a falling tree. He ought to  have known better than to let such a thing happen. I really don't see  how he could have been so careless. But the best of us will make  mistakes at times, and any pitcher may go once too often to the well. I  suppose that he had felled hundreds of trees and bushes, big and little,  in the course of his life, and he had never yet met with an accident;  but this time he thought he would take one more bite after the tree had  really begun to fall. So he thrust his head again into the narrowing  notch, and the wooden jaws closed upon him with a nip that was worse  than his own. He tried to draw back, but it was too late, his skull  crashed in, and his life went out like a candle.    And so, in a few hours, the city lost two of its best citizens--the very  two whom it could least afford to lose. If they had been spared they  might, perhaps, have known enough to scent the coming danger, and to  lead their families and neighbors away from the doomed town, deeper into  the heart of the wilderness. As it was, the trapper had things all his  own way, and by working carefully and cautiously he added skin after  skin to his store of beaver-pelts. I haven't time to tell you of all the  different ways in which he set his traps, nor can we stop to talk of the  various baits that he used, from castoreum to fresh sticks of birch or  willow, or of those other traps, still more artfully arranged, which had  no bait at all, but were cunningly hidden where the poor beavers would  be almost certain to step into them before they saw them. After all, it  was his awful success that mattered, rather than the way in which he  achieved it. Our friend's mother was one of the next to go, and the way  his brothers and sisters disappeared one after another was a thing to  break one's heart.    One night the Beaver himself came swimming down the pond, homeward  bound, and as he dived and approached the submarine entrance of the  lodge he noticed some stakes driven into the mud--stakes that had never  been there before. They seemed to form two rows, one on each side of his  course, but as there was room enough for him to pass between them he  swam straight ahead without stopping. His hands had no webs between the  fingers, and were of little use in swimming, so he had folded them back  against his body; but his big feet were working like the wheels of a  twin-screw steamer, and he was forging along at a great rate. Suddenly,  half-way down the lines of stakes, his breast touched the pan of a steel  trap, and the jaws flew up quick as a wink and strong as a vise.  Fortunately there was nothing that they could take hold of. They struck  him so hard that they lifted him bodily upward, but they caught only a  few hairs.    Even a scientific trapper may sometimes make mistakes, and when this one  came around to visit his trap, and found it sprung but empty, he thought  that the beavers must have learned its secret and sprung it on purpose.  There was no use, he decided, in trying to catch such intelligent  animals in their own doorway, and he took the trap up and set it in a  more out-of-the-way place. And so one source of danger was removed, just  because the Beaver was lucky enough to touch the pan with his breast  instead of with a foot.    A week later he was really caught by his right hand, and met with one of  the most thrilling adventures of his life. Oh, but that was a glorious  night! Dark as a pocket, no wind, thick black clouds overhead, and the  rain coming down in a steady, steady drizzles--just the kind of a night  that the beavers love, when the friendly darkness shuts their little  city in from all the rest of the world, and when they feel safe and  secure. Then, how the long yellow teeth gouge and tear at the tough  wood, how the trees come tumbling down, and how the branches and the  little logs come hurrying in to augment the winter food-piles! Often of  late the Beaver had noticed an unpleasant odor along the shores, an odor  that frightened him and made him very uneasy, but to-night the rain had  washed it all away, and the woods smelled as sweet and clean as if God  had just made them over new. And on this night, of all others, the  Beaver put his hand squarely into a steel trap.    He was in a shallow portion of the pond, and the chain was too short for  him to reach water deep enough to drown him; but now a new danger  appeared, for there on the low, mossy bank was an otter, glaring at him  through the darkness. Beaver-meat makes a very acceptable meal for an  otter, and the Beaver knew it. And he knew, also, how utterly helpless  he was, either to fly or to resist, with that heavy trap on his arm, and  its chain binding him to the stake. His heart sank like lead, and he  trembled from his nose to the end of his tail, and whimpered and cried  like a baby. But, strange to say, it was the trapper who saved him,  though, of course, it was done quite unintentionally. As the otter  advanced to the attack there came a sudden sharp click, and in another  second he too was struggling for dear life. Two traps had been set in  the shallow water. The Beaver had found one, and the otter the other.    The full story of that night, with all its details of fear and suffering"]]]
