Beautiful climate,  charming scenery, the choicest Art treasures in the world, every mile  teeming with historic and poetic interest, good hotels, and generally  comfortable travelling!\"    \"Yes, Italy will do,\" decided my wife; and we folded up the map and  proceeded at once to examine the time-tables, lists of fares, calculate  the costs of first and second class, and plan our route. The book of  mystification was then almost ungratefully closed, and the serious  business of packing commenced.    On the 20th of December, 1882, my wife and I,        \"Fired with ideas of fair Italy,\"    started on our travels in good spirits. Having secured our tickets, we  put up at the Charing Cross Hotel for the night, so as to be ready to  start the first thing in the morning.    Whatever vague feelings of regret we might secretly have nourished in  leaving dear old England and our time-honoured, old-fashioned Christmas,  were quickly dispelled the next morning, for as we sped away by the 7.40  train for Dover the weather assumed its most dismal aspect--cold, raw,  damp, and foggy. So we started with easy consciences, resolved to obtain  all possible benefit and enjoyment from the change.    Before reaching Dover, a little sunshine struggled forth to gladden us;  but it was blowing rather hard when we arrived at our destination, and  there was something of a sea to frighten the timorous. Being pretty fair  sailors, however, and by the exercise of a little thoughtful physical  preparation, we did not suffer from the voyage, and were able to render  some assistance to others less fortunate.    After being at sea even for a few hours, there is much in the sound of  \"land ahead\" to raise one's spirits, perhaps more especially when  crossing the Channel. There is no one who does not hail with delight the  first sight of the shore. It gladdens the hearts of the sickly ones, and  soon their childlike helplessness disappears; hope and life return,  sending the warm blood once more to the pallid cheek, and lighting the  languid eye with fresh joy and anticipation. It is pleasant to see how  quickly the sufferers shake off the evil spirit of the sea--the terrible  _mal de mer_, pull themselves together, and step on shore, beaming with  heroic smiles.    It is just at this time that the submarine Channel Tunnel scheme  possesses peculiar interest for the thoughtful. All lovers of Old  England feel proudly and justly that this little \"silver streak,\" with  its stormy waves and rock-bound shores, is, under the blessing of  Providence, her natural and national strength and glory. It has made her  sons daring and hardy, industrious, prosperous, and happy. It has  enabled her to people more than half the world with the Anglo-Saxon  race, and has extended her empire and influence beyond the setting sun.  It has made her the arbiter of the world, her sword--nay, her very word,  turning the scale against any power of wrong and might. It has protected  the world against the lust and avarice of Spain, and the conquering  tyranny of a Napoleon. It has made her the Bank and commercial depot of  the whole globe, and the first of civilized and civilizing powers.    It is true that the more closely nations are connected by mutual  interests, the more prosperous they become and the more friendly they  are. And doubtless such a means of communication between Great Britain  and the continent would materially increase that mutual interest--might  even make sulky France more friendly towards us, and probably prove of  benefit both commercially and socially; but only so long as the insular  power of England is maintained. Although our army and navy are hardly as  strong as they should be, we want no conscription here. What we do want  is to preserve the peace and honour of our homes, our children in the  colonies, and to increase rather than decrease the power of England for  the good of the whole world.    Therefore, if a tunnel or tunnels be made, we must be sure beforehand  that they can be perfectly protected against the means of surprise and  invasion, that in no manner of way can they be made a weak point in our  harness. As for destroying the tunnel, there would in all probability be  a train or two in it when a surprise was intended, and what commander  would blow up or destroy it under such circumstances? I fear the tunnel  would prove a grand place for ruffians; and what hideous depredations  and murderous attacks might not be committed in transit! Five minutes is  in all conscience long enough to be under the depressing influence of a  Hadean tunnel, but it would be an evil spirit who could tolerate it for  the best part of an hour.    Arrived at Calais, the train was already waiting to carry us onward, but  there was ample time for breakfast.    Calais station always seems to be undergoing a certain kind of  metamorphosis; and with its sand-hills and generally unfinished  condition, reminds the traveller of some remote part of the world, such  as Panama, for instance. Some day it may possibly be able to digest the  passenger traffic from England to the continent, but at present much  time is lost there from its being so gorged. It is absolutely refreshing  to catch a glimpse of the Calais fish women, with their gay costume,  wonderfully frilled, spotless white caps, and healthy faces.    Soon we are spinning along towards Paris, the weather pretty fine so  far, but the country sadly flooded; and, the lowlands being under water,  the gaunt and leafless poplar trees are the most conspicuous objects of  the landscape. Then for miles we travel along through a gloomy drizzling  rain, the land looking most forlornly desolate. The arrival at Amiens,  however, cheers us a little, and here we get a stretch and some  refreshment. After leaving this place, always interesting for its  beautiful Cathedral, the weather brightens up, and we reach Paris in  good time for dinner.    Thus far we have found travelling second class very agreeable, for when  the trains are fast there are advantages in so doing--more room and less  expense than by first class.    At Paris the examination of luggage is a perfect nuisance. An  Englishman, and still more an English _woman_, very reluctantly hands  over her keys to a French gen d'arme, who, be your presence never so  imposing, ruthlessly capsizes your careful and thoughtful stowage,  whilst you angrily or impatiently watch your travelling sanctum pried  into by dirty-handed, over-zealous officials. The one examination at  Calais, when there was plenty of time, should surely have sufficed; but  at the end of a journey, when one is tired and anxious to get to one's  hotel and dinner, it is aggravating beyond measure.    On this occasion the ladies' baggage was particularly selected for  inspection, much to the annoyance of my wife, who most unwillingly gave  up her keys, and declared her opinion that \"it was because gentlemen put  their cigars into the ladies' trunks.\" Of course this fully explained  it!    There is some difficulty in claiming one's possessions after their  examination, as there are legions of voracious hotel touters ready to  pounce upon not only \"somebody's,\" but everybody's luggage, and the  owners too, if possible, and carry all off to the omnibuses attached to  their several hotels.    However, we at last arrive at the St. James Hotel, in the Rue St.  Honore, where, as usual, there is quite an army of waiters to welcome  the \"coming guest.\" To an inexperienced traveller, and indeed to my  pleased wife, this is gratefully accepted as a _warm welcome_, but those  who have had some little experience know better, or rather worse.  Fortunately, we secure a room on the third floor, and therefore so far  carry out our resolutions of economy! and now, in preference to the  sumptuous _table d'hote_, we decide to dine _a la carte_, which means a  little table to yourself, where you may select what you wish to eat,  have it at any hour you please, and pay for just what you order. This is  not only less expensive, but far more quiet and comfortable after the  fatigue of a journey, than the crowded and imposing _table d'hote_, with  its never-ceasing clatter and chatter, where you will be lucky if you  find a dish that will prove agreeable to your palate. Sometimes,  however, the change is enjoyable, as you cannot fail to be amused at the  eccentricities of your neighbours; perhaps finding your own weaknesses  reflected in them. Often you will find a dozen nationalities  represented, and a perfect Babel-like talk, each little exclusive party,  like crows, intent only upon covering its own nest.    Paris is beautifully brilliant at the festive seasons, the shops filled  with lovely and costly presents, arranged with that exquisite taste so  natural to the French artiste. I think they have some very pretty  sentiments about their \"Noel.\" For instance, at early morn on Christmas  Day, whilst still in the land of dreams, a light tap comes at your  chamber door, and on rising you find it is a messenger bearing a bouquet  of choice and lovely flowers, with some dear friend's greeting.    Unfortunately the weather continued wet and cold; still, under cover of  the colonnades and on the fine boulevards there is always so  light-hearted and gay a throng, and so much to interest one, that it is  impossible to feel dull. Things here, however, quickly change from gay  to grave. A general officer's funeral passed through the boulevards  where we were standing, followed by a procession in which nearly every  branch of the army was represented. The open hearse, with coffin, was  covered with beautiful wreaths of flowers, among which lay the deceased  officer's sword, honours, etc. The touching expression of regret in the  faces of his comrades, and the respectful reverence evinced by the  people, making it altogether a very impressive sight.    The weather being still so wet, we decided not to remain after the  second"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23991"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 2 (#3)"],[1," 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 21-1/2 in., S-4-S.    Rear horizontals, 4 pieces, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 19-1/4 in., S-4-S.    Side horizontals, 4 pieces, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.    Back slats, 2 pieces, 5/16 by 3-1/2 by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.    Arms, 2 pieces, 1-1/8 by 4 by 24 in., S-4-S.    Seat slats, 5 pieces, 1/2 by 2-1/4 by 20 in., S-4-S.    Begin work by squaring up the ends of the front posts and shaping the  rear ones Chamfer the ends of the tops and bottoms slightly so that they  shall not splinter through usage. Next lay out the mortises and tenons.    The curved horizontals for the back should now be prepared and steamed  as described on another page. The curved form to which the steamed piece  is to be clamped to give shape to it should be curved slightly more than  is wanted in the piece, as the piece when released will tend to  straighten a little.    The arms of the chair may be shaped while these pieces are drying on the  forms. The rails of the front and back may be tenoned, too. It should  be noted that the front of the chair is wider than the back. This will  necessitate care in mortising and tenoning the side rails so as to get  good fits for the shoulders The bevel square will be needed in laying  out the shoulders of the tenons.    [Illustration: Arm Chair Having Bent-Wood Back]    [Illustration: Details of Curved Back Arm Chair]    Assemble the back, then the front. When the glue has hardened on these  parts so that the clamps may be removed, put in the side rails or  horizontals and again adjust the clamps. The arms are to be fastened  to the posts with dowels and glue.    The seat, it will be seen from the drawing, is to be a loose leather  cushion to rest upon slats. These seat slats may be fastened to cleats  which have been previously fastened to the inside of the front and back  seat rails or they may be \"let in\" to these rails by grooving their  inner surfaces before the rails have been put in place. The latter  method is more workmanlike, but more difficult.    A cushion such as is shown can be purchased ready made up, or it may be  made by the amateur by lacing together two pieces of Spanish leather cut  to size and punched along the edges so as to allow a lacing of leather  thong. It may be filled with hair or elastic felt such as upholsterers  use.    Probably the simplest finish that can be used is weathered oak. Put on a  coat of weather oak oil stain, sandpaper lightly when dry and then put  on a very thin coat of shellac. Sand this lightly and follow with two or  more coats of floor wax put on in very thin coatings and polished well.          A PLATE RACK      The plate rack shown in the accompanying illustration is designed for  use in a room furnished in mission style. The dimensions may be changed  to suit the wall space. The parts are held together entirely by keys.  The bar across the front is for keeping the plates from falling out, but  this may be left out if the plates are allowed to lean against the wall.    The following list of material will be needed, and, if the builder does  not care to do the rough work, the stock can be ordered planed, sanded  and cut to the exact size of the dimensions given.      2 ends, 7/8 by 5 by 20 in.    1 top, 7/8 by 6 by 36 in.    1 shelf, 7/8 by 5 by 36 in.    1 bar, 7/8 in. square by 36 in.    4 keys. Scrap pieces will do.    Lay out and cut the mortises on the end pieces for the tenons of the  shelf, also the tenons on the top ends and the diamond shaped openings.  In laying these out, work from the back edge of the pieces. Cut the  tenons on the ends of the shelf to fit the mortises in the end pieces,  numbering each one so the parts can be put together with the tenons in  the proper mortises. Mark out and cut the mortises in the top to receive  the tenons on the end pieces.    [Illustration: Parts Held Together by Keys]    In laying out the mortises for the keys allow a little extra on the side  toward the shoulder so the ends and tops may be drawn up tightly when  the keys are driven in the mortises. All the mortises and diamond  shaped openings should be marked and cut with a chisel from both sides  of the board.    If the bar is used, it may be attached with a flat side or edge out as  shown.    [Illustration: Details of Plate Rack]    Finish the pieces separately with any weathered or fumed oak stain. When  thoroughly dry, apply a very thin coat of shellac. Finish with two coats  of wax. The rack can be attached to the wall by two mirror plates  fastened on the back edges of the end pieces.          TOOL FOR MARKING DOWEL HOLES      On some work it is quite difficult to locate the exact point for a  dowel, but with the tool illustrated placed between the joint to be made  and the parts gently pressed together you have the exact point for the  dowel in each piece. The tool is made from a piece of sheet steel about  1/2 in. square with a pin having a point on both ends driven in the  center, as shown in Fig. 1. The tool is placed between the pieces that  are to be joined, as shown in Fig. 2. The small pin will mark the point  for the bit in both pieces exactly opposite.    [Illustration: Marking Bore Holes for Dowels]          A MAGAZINE TABLE      This little magazine table will be found a very useful piece of  furniture for the den or library. Its small size permits it to be set  anywhere in a room without being in the way. Quarter-sawed oak should be  used in its construction, and the following pieces will be needed:      4 legs, 2 by 2 by 29 in., S-4-S.    4 end slats, 1/2 by 2 by 10 in., S-4-S.    1 shelf, 1 by 16 by 30 in., S-1-S.    1 top board, 1 by 18 by 36 in., S-1-S.    If you are convenient to a planing mill you can secure these pieces  ready cut to length, squared and sanded. This will save you considerable  labor.    The four legs are finished on all sides and chamfered at the bottom to  prevent the corners from splitting. The mortises for the shelf should  be cut 9 in. from the top of each leg, as shown in the sketch. Care  should be taken to make these a perfect fit.    [Illustration: Table Complete]    The shelf should be finished on the top side and the four edges, and the  corners cut out to fit the mortises in the table legs. An enlarged view  of this joint is shown in the sketch.    The top board may have to be made of two 9-in. boards, dove-tailed and  glued together. It should be finished on the top side and the edges. The  edges can be beveled if desired. The board is fastened to the legs by  means of screws through four small brass angles. These angles can be  made or they can be purchased at any hardware store.    [Illustration: Details of Magazine Table]    The top board and the shelf should be mortised at each end for the 1/2  by 2-in. slats. These slats should be finished on all sides.    The table is now ready to be assembled and glued together. The glue  should dry at least 24 hours before the clamps are removed.    After the glue is dry, carefully go over the entire table with fine  sandpaper and remove all surplus glue and rough spots. It can now be  finished in any one of the mission stains which are supplied by the  trade for this purpose.          A WASTE PAPER BASKET      A waste paper basket of pleasing design, and very easy to construct, is  shown in the accompanying sketch. Quarter-sawed oak is the best wood to  use, and it is also the easiest to obtain. The following pieces will be  needed:       1 bottom piece, 3/4 by 9 in. square.     4 corner pieces, 3/4 in. square by 15-1/2 in.     4 top rails, 3/4 in. square by 7-1/2 in.    12 slats, 1/4 by 3/4 by 16-1/4 in.     4 blocks, 1 in. square.     4 F.H. screws, 2-1/2 in. long.    24 R.H. screws, 3/4 in. long.    [Illustration: A WASTE PAPER BASKET]    If the pieces are ordered from the mill cut to length, squared and  sanded, much labor will be saved. First bevel the ends of the corner  posts and the slats, as shown, and finish them with sandpaper. Bore the  holes in the posts and the railing for the dowel pins. These pins should  be about 3/8 in. in diameter and 3/4 in. long. When this is done the  parts can be glued together and laid aside to dry. The four blocks 1 in.  square are for the feet. Bore holes through these blocks and the corners  of the bottom board for the large screws to go through. Fasten them  together by running the screws through the blocks, and the board into  the ends of the corner posts as shown in the sketch. The 1/4-in. slats  can now be fastened on with the small round-headed screws. They should  be evenly spaced on the four sides. This completes the basket except for  the finish. This can be any one of the many finishes supplied by the  trade for this purpose.    [Illustration: DETAILS OF WASTE PAPER BASKET]          AN OAK WRITING DESK      For the writing desk shown in the accompanying picture the following  stock will be needed. The thicknesses of all the pieces are specified.  On the legs the widths, too, are specified. Quarter-sawed white oak is  the best wood to use, and it should be well seasoned and clear of shakes  and other imperfections.    STOCK BILL      2 front posts, 1-5/8 by 1-5/8 by 34 in., S-4-S., oak.    2 back posts, 1-5/8 by 1-5/8 by 42 in., S-4-S., oak.    2 lower side rails, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 15 in., S-2-S., oak.    1 lower back rail, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 27 in., S-2-S., oak.    2 sides, 3/4 by 9 by 14 in., S-2-S., oak.    2 sides, 3/4 by 10-1/2 by 14 in., S-2-S., oak.    1 back, 3/4 by 9 by 26 in., S-2-S., oak.    1 back, 3/4 by 10-1/2 by 26 in., S-2-S., oak.    1 top, 3/4 by 6 by 30-in., S-2-S., oak.    1 lid, 3/4 by 15 by 28 in., S-2-S., oak.    2 side shelves, 3/4 by 5 by 16 in., S-2-S., oak.    4 braces, 3/4 by 1-1/4 by 9 in., S-2-S., oak.    1 bottom of case, 3/4 by 16 by 28 in., S-2-S., oak.    INTERIOR      1 piece, 3/4 by 16 by 27 in., S-2-S., oak.    4 drawer and case bottom supports, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 28 in., S-2-S., oak.    6 drawer and case bottom supports, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 16 in., S-2-S., oak."]]]
