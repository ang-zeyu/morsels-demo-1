[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22925"],[0,"The Story of Young Abraham Lincoln (#3)"],[1,"Nancy Hanks  Lincoln at her wedding, a fresh-looking girl, I should say over twenty.  Tom was a respectable mechanic and could choose, and she was treated  with respect.    \"I was at the infare, too, given by John H. Parrott, her guardian, and  only girls with money had guardians appointed by the court. We had bear  meat; venison; wild turkey and ducks' eggs, wild and tame--so common  that you could buy them at two bits a bushel; maple sugar, swung on a  string, to bite off for coffee; syrup in big gourds, peach and honey; a  sheep that the two families barbecued whole over coals of wood burned in  a pit, and covered with green boughs to keep the juices in. Our table  was of the puncheons cut from solid logs, and the next day they were the  floor of the new cabin.\"    Thomas Lincoln took his bride to live in a little log cabin in a  Kentucky settlement--not a village or hardly a hamlet--called  Elizabethtown. He evidently thought this place would be less lonesome  for his wife, while he was away hunting and carpentering, than the  lonely farm he had purchased in Hardin County, about fourteen miles  away. There was so little carpentering or cabinet making to do that he  could make a better living by farming or hunting. Thomas was very fond  of shooting and as he was a fine marksman he could provide game for the  table, and other things which are considered luxuries to-day, such as  furs and skins needed for the primitive wearing apparel of the  pioneers. A daughter was born to the young couple at Elizabethtown, whom  they named Sarah.    Dennis Hanks, a cousin of Nancy, lived near the Lincolns in the early  days of their married life, and gave Mrs. Eleanor Atkinson this  description of their early life together:    \"Looks didn't count them days, nohow. It was stren'th an' work an'  daredevil. A lazy man or a coward was jist pizen, an' a spindlin' feller  had to stay in the settlemints. The clearin's hadn't no use fur him. Tom  was strong, an' he wasn't lazy nor afeer'd o' nothin', but he was kind  o' shif'less--couldn't git nothin' ahead, an' didn't keer putickalar.  Lots o' them kind o' fellers in 'arly days, 'druther hunt and fish, an'  I reckon they had their use. They killed off the varmints an' made it  safe fur other fellers to go into the woods with an ax.    \"When Nancy married Tom he was workin' in a carpenter shop. It wasn't  Tom's fault he couldn't make a livin' by his trade. Thar was sca'cely  any money in that kentry. Every man had to do his own tinkerin', an'  keep everlastin'ly at work to git enough to eat. So Tom tuk up some  land. It was mighty ornery land, but it was the best Tom could git,  when he hadn't much to trade fur it.    \"Pore? We was all pore, them days, but the Lincolns was porer than  anybody. Choppin' trees an' grubbin' roots an' splittin' rails an'  huntin' an' trappin' didn't leave Tom no time. It was all he could do to  git his fambly enough to eat and to kiver 'em. Nancy was turrible  ashamed o' the way they lived, but she knowed Tom was doin' his best,  an' she wa'n't the pesterin' kind. She was purty as a pictur' an' smart  as you'd find 'em anywhere. She could read an' write. The Hankses was  some smarter'n the Lincolns. Tom thought a heap o' Nancy, an' he was as  good to her as he knowed how. He didn't drink or swear or play cyards or  fight, an' them was drinkin', cussin', quarrelsome days. Tom was  popylar, an' he could lick a bully if he had to. He jist couldn't git  ahead, somehow.\"      \"NANCY'S BOY BABY\"    Evidently Elizabethtown failed to furnish Thomas Lincoln a living wage  from carpentering, for he moved with his young wife and his baby girl to  a farm on Nolen Creek, fourteen miles away. The chief attraction of the  so-called farm was a fine spring of water bubbling up in the shade of a  small grove. From this spring the place came to be known as \"Rock Spring  Farm.\" It was a barren spot and the cabin on it was a rude and primitive  sort of home for a carpenter and joiner to occupy. It contained but a  single room, with only one window and one door. There was a wide  fireplace in the big chimney which was built outside. But that rude hut  became the home of \"the greatest American.\"    Abraham Lincoln was born to poverty and privation, but he was never a  pauper. His hardships were those of many other pioneers, the wealthiest  of whom suffered greater privations than the poorest laboring man has to  endure to-day.    After his nomination to the presidency, Mr. Lincoln gave to Mr. Hicks, a  portrait painter, this memorandum of his birth:            \"I was born February 12, 1809, in then Hardin          County, Kentucky, at a point within the now          county of Larue, a mile or a mile and a half          from where Hodgen's mill now is. My parents          being dead, and my memory not serving, I know          no means of identifying the precise locality.          It was on Nolen Creek.                                                    \"A. LINCOLN.          \"JUNE 14, 1860.\"    The exact spot was identified after his death, and the house was found  standing many years later. The logs were removed to Chicago, for the  World's Columbian Exposition, in 1893, and the cabin was reconstructed  and exhibited there and elsewhere in the United States. The materials  were taken back to their original site, and a fine marble structure now  encloses the precious relics of the birthplace of \"the first American,\"  as Lowell calls Lincoln in his great \"Commemoration Ode.\"    Cousin Dennis Hanks gives the following quaint description of \"Nancy's  boy baby,\" as reported by Mrs. Eleanor Atkinson in her little book on  \"Lincoln's Boyhood.\"    \"Tom an' Nancy lived on a farm about two miles from us, when Abe was  born. I ricollect Tom comin' over to our house one cold mornin' in  Feb'uary an' sayin' kind o' slow, 'Nancy's got a boy baby.'    \"Mother got flustered an' hurried up 'er work to go over to look after  the little feller, but I didn't have nothin' to wait fur, so I cut an'  run the hull two mile to see my new cousin.    \"You bet I was tickled to death. Babies wasn't as common as blackberries  in the woods o' Kaintucky. Mother come over an' washed him an' put a  yaller flannel petticoat on him, an' cooked some dried berries with wild  honey fur Nancy, an' slicked things up an' went home. An' that's all the  nuss'n either of 'em got.    \"I rolled up in a b'ar skin an' slep' by the fireplace that night, so's  I could see the little feller when he cried an' Tom had to get up an'  tend to him. Nancy let me hold him purty soon. Folks often ask me if Abe  was a good lookin' baby. Well, now, he looked just like any other baby,  at fust--like red cherry pulp squeezed dry. An' he didn't improve none  as he growed older. Abe never was much fur looks. I ricollect how Tom  joked about Abe's long legs when he was toddlin' round the cabin. He  growed out o' his clothes faster'n Nancy could make 'em.    \"But he was mighty good comp'ny, solemn as a papoose, but interested in  everything. An' he always did have fits o' cuttin' up. I've seen him  when he was a little feller, settin' on a stool, starin' at a visitor.  All of a sudden he'd bu'st out laughin' fit to kill. If he told us what  he was laughin' at, half the time we couldn't see no joke.    \"Abe never give Nancy no trouble after he could walk excep' to keep him  in clothes. Most o' the time he went bar'foot. Ever wear a wet buckskin  glove? Them moccasins wasn't no putection ag'inst the wet. Birch bark  with hickory bark soles, strapped on over yarn socks, beat buckskin all  holler, fur snow. Abe'n me got purty handy contrivin' things that way.  An' Abe was right out in the woods about as soon's he was weaned,  fishin' in the creek, settin' traps fur rabbits an' muskrats, goin' on  coon-hunts with Tom an' me an' the dogs, follerin' up bees to find  bee-trees, an' drappin' corn fur his pappy. Mighty interestin' life fur  a boy, but thar was a good many chances he wouldn't live to grow up.\"    When little Abe was four years old his father and mother moved from Rock  Spring Farm to a better place on Knob Creek, a few miles to the  northeast of the farm where he was born.          CHAPTER III    THE BOY LINCOLN'S BEST TEACHER      At Knob Creek the boy began to go to an \"A B C\" school. His first  teacher was Zachariah Riney. Of course, there were no regular schools in  the backwoods then. When a man who \"knew enough\" happened to come along,  especially if he had nothing else to do, he tried to teach the children  of the pioneers in a poor log schoolhouse. It is not likely that little  Abe went to school more than a few weeks at this time, for he never had  a year's schooling in his life. There was another teacher afterward at  Knob Creek--a man named Caleb Hazel. Little is known of either of these  teachers except that he taught little Abe Lincoln. If their pupil had  not become famous the men and their schools would never have been  mentioned in history.    An old man, named Austin Gollaher, used to like to tell of the days when  he and little Abe went to school together. He said:    \"Abe was an unusually bright boy at school, and made splendid progress  in his studies. Indeed, he learned faster than any of his schoolmates.  Though so young, he studied very hard.\"    Although Nancy Lincoln insisted on sending the children to school, when  there was any, she had a large share in Abe's early education, just as  she had taught his father to write his own name. She told them Bible  stories and such others as she had picked up in her barren, backwoods  life. She and her husband were too religious to believe in telling their  children fairy tales.    The best thing of all was the reading of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" during  the long Winter evenings, after the wood was brought in and Father Tom  had set his traps and done his other work for the night. Nancy's voice  was low, with soft, southern tones and accents.

(1) Its area of approximately 590,000 square miles makes it two and a  half times as large as the State of Texas.    (2) But it is not, like Texas, one homogeneous body of land; it is not,  in any geographical sense, one country at all. \"Sweeping in a great arc  over sixteen degrees of latitude and fifty-eight degrees of longitude,\"  it is no less than four, and some might say five, different countries,  differing from one another in almost every way that one country can  differ from another: in climate, in population, in resources, in  requirements; and--    (3) These different countries are not merely different from one another,  they are _separated_ from one another by formidable natural barriers.          TEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLED          CHAPTER I    FAIRBANKS TO THE CHANDALAR THROUGH CIRCLE CITY AND FORT YUKON      THE plan for the winter journey of 1905-6 (my second winter on the  trail) was an ambitious one, for it contemplated a visit to Point Hope,  on the shore of the Arctic Ocean between Kotzebue Sound and Point  Barrow, and a return to Fairbanks. In the summer such a journey would be  practicable only by water: down the Tanana to the Yukon, down the Yukon  to its mouth, and then through the straits of Bering and along the  Arctic coast; in the winter it is possible to make the journey across  country. A desire to visit our most northerly and most inaccessible  mission in Alaska and a desire to become acquainted with general  conditions in the wide country north of the Yukon were equal factors in  the planning of a journey which would carry me through three and a half  degrees of latitude and no less than eighteen degrees of longitude.    The course of winter travel in Alaska follows the frozen waterways so  far as they lead in the general direction desired, leaves them to cross  mountain ranges and divides at the most favourable points, and drops  down into the streams again so soon as streams are available. The  country is notably well watered and the waterways are the natural  highways. The more frequented routes gradually cut out the serpentine  bends of the rivers by land trails, but in the wilder parts of the  country travel sticks to the ice.    Our course, therefore, lay up the Chatanika River and one of its  tributaries until the Tanana-Yukon watershed was reached; then through  the mountains, crossing two steep summits to the Yukon slope, and down  that slope by convenient streams to the Yukon River at Circle City.    [Sidenote: THE GOLD TRAIN]    We set out on the 27th of November with six dogs and a \"basket\" sled and  about five hundred pounds' weight of load, including tent and stove,  bedding, clothes for the winter, grub box and its equipment, and dog  feed. The dogs were those that I had used the previous winter, with one  exception. The leader had come home lame from the fish camp where he had  been boarded during the summer, and, despite all attentions, the  lameness had persisted; so he must be left behind, and there was much  difficulty in securing another leader. A recent stampede to a new mining  district had advanced the price of dogs and gathered up all the good  ones, so it was necessary to hunt all over Fairbanks and pay a hundred  dollars for a dog that proved very indifferent, after all. \"Jimmy\" was a  handsome beast, the handsomest I ever owned and the costliest, but, as I  learned later from one who knew his history, had \"travelled on his  looks all his life.\" He earned the name of \"Jimmy the Fake.\"    Midway to Cleary \"City,\" on the chief gold-producing creek of the  district, our first day's run, we encountered the gold train. For some  time previous a lone highwayman had robbed solitary miners on their way  to Fairbanks with gold-dust, and now a posse was organised that went the  rounds of the creeks and gathered up the dust and bore it on mule-back  to the bank, escorted by half a dozen armed and mounted men. Sawed-off  shotguns were the favourite weapons, and one judged them deadly enough  at short range. The heavy \"pokes\" galled the animals' backs, however  they might be slung, and the little procession wound slowly along, a man  ahead, a man behind, and four clustered round the treasure.    These raw, temporary mining towns are much alike the world over, one  supposes, though perhaps a little worse up here in the far north. It was  late at night when we reached the place, but saloon and dance-hall were  ablaze with light and loud with the raucity of phonographs and the  stamping of feet. Everything was \"wide open,\" and there was not even the  thinnest veneer of respectability. Drinking and gambling and dancing go  on all night long. Drunken men reel out upon the snow; painted faces  leer over muslin curtains as one passes by. Without any government,  without any pretence of municipal organisation, there is no co-operation  for public enterprise. There are no streets, there are no sidewalks  save such as a man may choose to lay in front of his own premises, and  the simplest sanitary precautions are entirely neglected. Nothing but  the cold climate of the north prevents epidemic disease from sweeping  through these places. They rise in a few days wherever gold is found in  quantities, they flourish as the production increases, decline with its  decline, and are left gaunt, dark, and abandoned so soon as the diggings  are exhausted.    The next day we were on the Chatanika River, to which Cleary Creek is  tributary, and were immediately confronted with one of the main troubles  and difficulties of winter travel in this and, as may be supposed, in  any arctic or subarctic country--overflow water.    [Sidenote: OVERFLOW WATER AND ICE]    In the lesser rivers, where deep pools alternate with swift shallows,  the stream freezes solid to the bottom upon the shoals and riffles.  Since the subterranean fountains that supply the river do not cease to  discharge their waters in the winter, however cold it may be, there  comes presently an increasing pressure under the ice above such a  barrier. The pent-up water is strong enough to heave the ice into mounds  and at last to break forth, spreading itself far along the frozen  surface of the river. At times it may be seen gushing out like an  artesian well, rising three or four feet above the surface of the ice,  until the pressure is relieved. Sometimes for many miles at a stretch  the whole river will be covered with a succession of such overflows,  from two or three inches deep to eight or ten, or even twelve; some just  bursting forth, some partially frozen, some resolved into solid \"glare\"  ice. Thus the surface of the river is continually renewed the whole  winter through, and a section of the ice crust in the spring would show  a series of laminations; here ice upon ice, there ice upon  half-incorporated snow, that mark the successive inundations.    This explanation has been given at length because of the large part that  the phenomenon plays in the difficulty and danger of winter travel, and  because it seems hard to make those who are not familiar with it  understand it. At first sight it would seem that after a week or ten  days of fifty-below-zero weather, for instance, all water everywhere  would be frozen into quiescence for the rest of the winter. Throw a  bucket of water into the air, and it is frozen solid as soon as it  reaches the ground. There would be no more trouble, one would think,  with water. Yet some of the worst trouble the traveller has with  overflow water is during very cold weather, and it is then, of course,  that there is the greatest danger of frost-bite in getting one's feet  wet.
