I was specially urged to make as large a  collection as possible, and the choice of locality was generously left  to my discretion.    Leaving Washington on the 25th of May, I obtained a collection and  returned with it to that city on the 15th of September, having spent  three months in the field. The material brought back by the expedition  was catalogued under 966 entries, numbering somewhat over a thousand  specimens. The majority of these objects are fine examples of mortuary  pottery of excellent character, fully 500 of which are decorated.    I was particularly fortunate in my scientific collaborators. Mr F. W.  Hodge, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, joined me at Sikyatki, and  remained with the expedition until it disbanded, at the close of  August. Much of my success in the work at that ruin was due to his  advice and aid. He was constantly at the excavations, and the majority  of the beautiful specimens were taken out of the graves by him. It is  with the greatest pleasure that I am permitted to express my  appreciation of his assistance in my archeological investigations at  Sikyatki. Mr G. P. Winship, now librarian of the John Carter Brown  Library at Providence, visited our camp at the ruin mentioned, and  remained with us a few weeks, rendering important aid and adding an  enthusiastic student to our number. Mr James S. Judd was a volunteer  assistant while we were at Sikyatki, aiding me in many ways,  especially in the management of our camp. I need only to refer to the  beautiful drawings which accompany this memoir to show how much I am  indebted to Mrs Hodge for faithful colored figures of the remarkable  pottery uncovered from the Tusayan sands. My party included Mr S.  Goddard, of Prescott, Arizona, who served as cook and driver, and Mr  Erwin Baer, of the same city, as photographer. The manual work at the  ruins was done by a number of young Indians from the East Mesa, who  very properly were employed on the Moki reservation. An all too  prevalent and often unjust criticism that Indians will not work if  paid for their labor, was not voiced by any of our party. They gave  many a weary hour's labor in the hot sun, in their enthusiasm to make  the collection as large as possible.    On my return to Washington I was invited to prepare a preliminary  account of my work in the field, which the Secretary of the  Smithsonian Institution did me the honor to publish in his report for  1895. This report was of a very general character, and from necessity  limited in pages; consequently it presented only the more salient  features of my explorations.    The following account was prepared as a more exhaustive discussion of  the results of my summer's work. The memoir is much more extended than  I had expected to make it when I accepted the invitation to collect  archeological objects for the Museum, and betrays, I fear,  imperfections due to the limited time spent in the field. The main  object of the expedition was a collection of specimens, the majority  of which, now on exhibition in the National Museum, tell their own  story regarding its success.    I am under deep obligations to the officers of the Smithsonian  Institution, the National Museum, and the Bureau of American Ethnology  for many kindnesses, and wish especially to express my thanks to Mr S.  P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, for the  opportunity to study the ancient ruins of Tusayan. Nothing had a  greater influence on my final decision to abandon other congenial work  and undertake this, than my profound respect for the late Dr G. Brown  Goode, who suggested the expedition to me and urged me to plan and  undertake it.                               JESSE WALTER FEWKES.    _Washington, May, 1897._          PLAN OF THE EXPEDITION      It seemed to me in making a plan for archeological field work in 1895,  that the prehistoric cliff houses, cave dwellings, and ruined pueblos  of Arizona afforded valuable opportunities for research, and past  experience induced me to turn my steps more especially to the northern  and northeastern parts of the territory.[1] The ruins of ancient  habitations in these regions had been partially, and, I believe,  unsatisfactorily explored, especially those in a limited area called  Tusayan, now inhabited by the Moki or Hopi Indians. These agricultural  people claim to be descendants of those who once lived in the now  deserted villages of that province.    I had some knowledge of the ethnology of the Hopi, derived from  several summers' field work among them, and I believed this  information could be successfully utilized in an attempt to solve  certain archeological questions which presented themselves.[2] I  desired, among other things, to obtain new information on the former  extension, in one direction, of the ancestral abodes of certain clans  of the sedentary people of Tusayan which are now limited to six  pueblos in the northeastern part of the territory. In carrying out  this general plan I made an examination of cliff dwellings and other  ruins in Verde valley, and undertook an exploration of two old pueblos  near the Hopi villages. The reason which determined my choice of the  former as a field for investigation was a wish to obtain archeological  data bearing on certain Tusayan traditions. It is claimed by the  traditionists of Walpi, especially those of the Patki[3] or  Water-house phratry, that their ancestors came from a land far to the  south of Tusayan, to which they give the name Palatkwabi. The  situation of this mythic place is a matter of considerable conjecture,  but it was thought that an archeological examination of the country at  or near the headwaters of the Rio Verde and its tributaries might shed  light on this tradition.    It is not claimed, however, that all the ancestors of the Tusayan  people migrated from the south, nor do I believe that those who came  from that direction necessarily passed through Verde valley. Some, no  doubt, came from Tonto Basin, but I believe it can be shown that a  continuous line of ruins, similar in details of architecture, extend  along this river from its junction with Salt river to well-established  prehistoric dwelling places of the Hopi people. Similar lines may  likewise be traced along other northern tributaries of the Salt or the  Gila, which may be found to indicate early migration stages.    The ruins of Verde valley were discovered in 1854 by Antoine Leroux, a  celebrated guide and trapper of his time, and were thus described by  Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner in the following year:         The river banks were covered with ruins of stone houses and       regular fortifications; which, he [Leroux] says, appeared to       have been the work of civilized men, but had not been       occupied for centuries. They were built upon the most       fertile tracts of the valley, where were signs of acequias       and of cultivation. The walls were of solid masonry, of       rectangular form, some twenty or thirty paces in length, and       yet remaining ten or fifteen feet in height. The buildings       were of two stories, with small apertures or loopholes for       defence when besieged.... In other respects, however, Leroux       says that they reminded him of the great pueblos of the       Moquinos.[4]    A fragment of folklore, which is widely distributed among both the  aboriginal peoples of Gila valley and the modern Tusayan Indians,  recounts how the latter were at one time in communication with the  people of the south, and traditions of both distinctly connect the  sedentary people of Tusayan with those who formerly inhabited the  great pueblos, now in ruins, dotting the plain in the delta between  Gila and Salt rivers. That archeology might give valuable information  on this question had long been my conviction, and was the main  influence which led me to the studies recorded in the following pages.    An examination of a map of Arizona will show that one of the pathways  or feasible routes of travel possible to have been used in any  connection between the pueblos of the Gila and those of northern  Arizona would naturally be along Rio Verde valley. Its tributaries  rise at the foot of San Francisco mountains, and the main river  empties into the Salt, traversing from north to south a comparatively  fertile valley, in the main advantageous for the subsistence of  semisedentary bands in their migrations. Here was a natural highway  leading from the Gila pueblos, now in ruins, to the former villages in  the north.    The study of the archeology of Verde valley had gone far enough to  show that the banks of the river were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23692"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 1 (of 8) (#3)"],[1,"kraals by the river, their camp fires, their flocks  and herds, and immunity from the vexation of monopolies and taxes.  And here at once will be seen how the seeds sprang up of a rooted  antagonism between Boer and Briton that nothing can ever remove, and  no diplomacy can smooth away. The Boer nature naturally inclines to  a sluggish content, while the British one invariably pants for  advance. The temperamental tug of war, therefore, has been one that  has grown stronger and stronger with the progress of years. The  principles of give and take have been tried, but they have failed.  Reciprocity is not in the nature of the Boer, and without  reciprocity society and States are at a standstill. The Boer is  accredited with the primitive virtues, innocence, sturdiness,  contentment. If he has these, he has also the defects of his  qualities. He is crafty, stubborn, and narrow, and intolerant of  everything beyond the limits of his native comprehension.  Innovations of any kind are sufficient to fill him with suspicion,  and those started by the British in their first efforts at Cape  government were as gall and wormwood to his untrammelled taste.  These efforts, it must be owned, were not altogether happy. There  was first a rearrangement of local governments and of the Law  Courts; then, in 1827, followed a decree that English should be the  official language. As at that time not more than one colonist in  seven was British, the new arrangement was calculated to make  confusion worse confounded! The disgust of the Cape Dutch may be  imagined! The finishing touch came in 1834. By the abolition of  slavery--humane though its object was--the Cape colonists were  exceedingly hard hit; and though the owners of slaves were  compensated to the tune of a million and a quarter (the slaves were  valued at three millions sterling), they continued to maintain a  simmering resentment. Added to this came the intervention of the  missionaries, who attempted to instil into the Boer mind a sense of  the equality, in the sight of Heaven, of the black and the white  races.    At this time 12,000 Kaffirs had crossed over the border and invaded  the settlements, dealing death and destruction wherever they went.  They were finally repulsed by the British, and Sir Benjamin D'Urban,  the Governor at the Cape, proclaimed the annexation of the country  beyond the Keiskamma, on the eastern boundary of the Colony, as far  as the Kei. But no sooner had he accomplished this diplomatic move  in his wise discretion, than orders came from the British Government  to the effect that the land was to be restored to the Kaffirs and  the frontier boundary moved back to its original place--Keiskamma.  Sir Benjamin D'Urban carried out these orders much to his disgust,  for he deemed the annexation of the province to be necessary to the  peace of all the surrounding districts. But this was neither the  first nor the last occasion in the history of Cape government on  which men of practical experience have had to give way before wise  heads in Downing Street arm-chairs.    This action on the part of the Government was as the last straw to  the overladen camel. The patience of the Dutch Boers broke down. The  introduction of a foreign and incomprehensible tongue, the abolition  of slavery, and finally the restoration to the despised Kaffirs of a  conquered province, were indignities past bearing. There was a  general exodus. Off to the neighbourhood of the Orange and the Vaal  Rivers lumbered the long waggon trains drawn by innumerable oxen,  bearing, to pastures new and undefiled by the British, the irate  Boers and their household gods. It was a pathetic departure, this  voluntary exile into strange and unknown regions. The first  pioneers, after a long and wearisome journey to Delagoa Bay, fell  sick and retraced their steps to Natal only to die. The next great  company started forth in the winter of 1836. Some went to the  districts between the Orange and the Vaal Rivers--the district now  known as the Orange Free State; others went into the country north  of the Vaal River--the district now called the Transvaal; while  others again went beyond the mountains to the district now named  Natal. Here the Boer hoped to lead a new and a peaceful life, to  encamp himself by some river course with his kraal for his sheep and  his goats, the wide veldt for his carpet, and the blue dome of  heaven or the canvas of his waggon for his untaxed roof. But his  hopes were of short duration. The poor trekker--to use the vulgar  phrase--had fallen out of the frying-pan into the fire. He had fled  from the \"British tyrant\" only to encounter the Matabele Zulu  savage. A terrible feud between the Bantu tribes was then causing  much violence and blood-spilling, and the Zulu chief Moselekalse,  having driven the Bechuanas beyond the Limpopo, had established the  kingdom of the Matabele. With this chief, the Boer Potgieter and a  party of burghers, on exploration intent, came suddenly into  collision. Some of the Boers fled, the rest were promptly massacred.  Those who remained alive made plans for self-defence. They lashed  their waggons together to form a laager, and within it placed their  women and children in partial safety. They then gave the warriors of  Moselekalse a warm reception. The fight was maintained with great  energy, the Zulus raining assegais over the waggons, while the Boers  returned the compliment with their firearms. For these they had  plenty of ammunition, and relays of guns were loaded and handed out  gallantly by their women from within the laager. The Boers were  victorious. Their aim was true, their pluck enormous, and after a  sharp engagement the enemy were forced to retire. The savages were  not vanquished, however, till terrible damage had been inflicted on  the laager. Not content with the loss of many of their number, their  sheep and their cattle, the plucky Boers started forth to punish the  Matabele. Though few in number the burghers had the advantage of  rifles, and succeeded in triumphing over the enemy and establishing  themselves at Winburg, on the Vet River, to west of Harrismith.  Later on the Boer farmers prepared to trek into Natal. They had  prospected the place and found it entirely suited to their  agricultural needs. Water and game were plentiful, and the whole  country was fertile as a garden. Here they proposed to settle down.  At Port Natal--now known by the name of Durban--was a party of  Englishmen with whom the Boer explorers got on friendly terms. Both  Englishmen and Boers were aware that the district was under Zulu  sway, and it was decided that the chief, Dingaan, should be  interviewed as to the approaching settlement of the Boers. The wily  Zulu received his late enemies with every show of amity. He offered  them refreshments, he made entertainments for their amusement. He  finally agreed to cede such territory as was demanded by the Boers,  provided they would secure to him certain cattle that had been  stolen from him by a chief named Sikonyela. This the Boers agreed to  do. They promptly travelled to see Sikonyela, and by threats,  persuasions, or other mysterious means, extracted from him his  ill-gotten gains. With the restored cattle the whole party of Boers  then passed on their way from Drakensberg to Natal, full of the hope  of finally making a settlement in a region so well suited to their  pastoral instincts.    On again visiting the chief Dingaan, they were again received with  honour. More festivities were arranged, and the date of the signing  of the treaty was fixed for the 4th of February 1838.    The day came. The burghers arrived in the customary picturesqueness  of woollen shirts, round hats, rough coats, and leathern  veldt-broeks. Dingaan, amiable to excess, insisted that they should  accompany him to his kraal, and there make a formal leave-taking.  They were requested to leave their arms outside as an earnest of  good faith, and, with some suspicion, they acceded. Their reception  was splendid. Their health was drunk, the calabash passed round, and  then--then, at a given signal from the chief, the Zulu hordes rushed  in, fully armed and raging. In less time than it takes to describe  the deed, the defenceless company of Boer farmers were slaughtered  in cold blood--slaughtered before they could lift even a fist in  self-defence! This horrible act of treachery served to do away at  one fell swoop with the whole Boer party. Their bones, piled in a  heap without the kraal, alone remained to tell to their kindred the  tale of their undoing. The Zulus then proceeded in their tens of  thousands to attack the nearest encampment, and cut down all who  came in their way. Men--women--children--they spared none. The  tidings being carried to the outer encampments of the Boers, they  prepared themselves for the worst. They and their gallant _vrows_,  who fought with as cool and obstinate a courage as their husbands,  resisted the onslaught staunchly and successfully; but they paid  dearly for their boldness. Their cattle were demolished, and their  numbers were miserably thinned. Some thought of retiring from Natal;  some contemplated revenge.    The pathetic state of the Boers attracted the sympathy of the  Englishmen then in Natal, and they joined hands. Potgieter and Uys  then commanded a force, and marched out on the enemy, but  unfortunately fell into an ambush and were slain. Among the dead  were the commandant Uys and his son.    Then the Englishmen, not to be behindhand in the fray, came to the  rescue. Though there were but seventeen of them, they went out  accompanied by 1500 Hottentots to meet the enemy. They followed the  retreating savages beyond the Tugela, when suddenly they found  themselves face to face with a fierce multitude of 70,000 Zulus. A  conflict of the most terrible kind ensued: a conflict the more  terrible because at the same time so heroic and so hopeless. From"]]]
