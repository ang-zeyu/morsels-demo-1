In the cities stone and brick were much used,  and by 1700 nearly all Philadelphia houses had balconies running the  entire length of the second story. The stoop before the door was  universal.    For half a century nearly all New England houses were cottages. Many had  thatched roofs. Seaside towns set aside for public use certain reedy  lots between salt-marsh and low-water mark, where thatch could be freely  cut. The catted chimneys were of logs plastered with clay, or platted,  that is, made of reeds and mortar; and as wood and hay were stacked in  the streets, all the early towns suffered much from fires, and soon laws  were passed forbidding the building of these unsafe chimneys; as brick  was imported and made, and stone was quarried, there was certainly no  need to use such danger-filled materials. Fire-wardens were appointed  who peered around in all the kitchens, hunting for what they called foul  chimney hearts, and they ordered flag-roofs and wooden chimneys to be  removed, and replaced with stone or brick ones. In Boston every  housekeeper had to own a fire-ladder; and ladders and buckets were kept  in the church. Salem kept its \"fire-buckets and hook'd poles\" in the  town-house. Soon in all towns each family owned fire-buckets made of  heavy leather and marked with the owner's name or initials. The entire  town constituted the fire company, and the method of using the  fire-buckets was this. As soon as an alarm of fire was given by shouts  or bell-ringing, every one ran at once towards the scene of the fire.  All who owned buckets carried them, and if any person was delayed even  for a few minutes, he flung his fire-buckets from the window into the  street, where some one in the running crowd seized them and carried them  on. On reaching the fire, a double line called lanes of persons was made  from the fire to the river or pond, or a well. A very good  representation of these lanes is given in this fireman's certificate of  the year 1800.    The buckets, filled with water, were passed from hand to hand, up one  line of persons to the fire, while the empty ones went down the other  line. Boys were stationed on the _dry lane_. Thus a constant supply of  water was carried to the fire. If any person attempted to pass through  the line, or hinder the work, he promptly got a bucketful or two of  water poured over him. When the fire was over, the fire-warden took  charge of the buckets; some hours later the owners appeared, each picked  out his own buckets from the pile, carried them home, and hung them up  by the front door, ready to be seized again for use at the next alarm of  fire.    Many of these old fire-buckets are still preserved, and deservedly are  cherished heirlooms, for they represent the dignity and importance due  a house-holding ancestor. They were a valued possession at the time of  their use, and a costly one, being, made of the best leather. They were  often painted not only with the name of the owner, but with family  mottoes, crests, or appropriate inscriptions, sometimes in Latin. The  leather hand-buckets of the Donnison family of Boston are here shown;  those of the Quincy family bear the legend _Impavadi Flammarium_; those  of the Oliver family, _Friend and Public_. In these fire-buckets were  often kept, tightly rolled, strong canvas bags, in which valuables  could be thrust and carried from the burning building.    The first fire-engine made in this country was for the town of Boston,  and was made about 1650 by Joseph Jencks, the famous old iron-worker in  Lynn. It was doubtless very simple in shape, as were its successors  until well into this century. The first fire-engine used in Brooklyn,  New York, is here shown. It was made in 1785 by Jacob Boome. Relays of  men at both handles worked the clumsy pump. The water supply for this  engine was still only through the lanes of fire-buckets, except in rare  cases.    By the year 1670 wooden chimneys and log houses of the Plymouth and Bay  colonies were replaced by more sightly houses of two stories, which were  frequently built with the second story jutting out a foot or two over  the first, and sometimes with the attic story still further extending  over the second story. A few of these are still standing: The  White-Ellery House, at Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1707, is here  shown. This \"overhang\" is popularly supposed to have been built for the  purpose of affording a convenient shooting-place from which to repel the  Indians. This is, however, an historic fable. The overhanging second  story was a common form of building in England in the time of Queen  Elizabeth, and the Massachusetts and Rhode Island settlers simply and  naturally copied their old homes.    The roofs of many of these new houses were steep, and were shingled with  hand-riven shingles. The walls between the rooms were of clay mixed with  chopped straw. Sometimes the walls were whitened with a wash made of  powdered clam-shells. The ground floors were occasionally of earth, but  puncheon floors were common in the better houses. The well-smoothed  timbers were sanded in careful designs with cleanly beach sand.    By 1676 the Royal Commissioners wrote of Boston that the streets were  crooked, and the houses usually wooden, with a few of brick and stone.  It is a favorite tradition of brick houses in all the colonies that the  brick for them was brought from England. As excellent brick was made  here, I cannot believe all these tales that are told. Occasionally a  house, such as the splendid Warner Mansion, still standing in  Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is proved to be of imported brick by the  bills which are still existing for the purchase and transportation of  the brick. A later form of many houses was two stories or two stories  and a half in front, with a peaked roof that sloped down nearly to the  ground in the back over an ell covering the kitchen, added in the shape  known as a lean-to, or, as it was called by country folk, the linter.  This sloping roof gave the one element of unconscious picturesqueness  which redeemed the prosaic ugliness of these bare-walled houses. Many  lean-to houses are still standing in New England. The Boardman Hill  House, built at North Saugus, Massachusetts, two centuries and a half  ago, and the two houses of lean-to form, the birthplaces of President  John Adams and of President John Quincy Adams, are typical examples.    The next roof-form, built from early colonial days, and popular a  century ago, was what was known as the gambrel roof. This resembled, on  two sides, the mansard roof of France in the seventeenth century, but  was also gabled at two ends. The gambrel roof had a certain grace of  outline, especially when joined with lean-tos and other additions. The  house partly built in 1636 in Dedham, Massachusetts, by my far-away  grandfather, and known as the Fairbanks House, is the oldest  gambrel-roofed house now standing. It is still occupied by one of his  descendants in the eighth generation. The rear view of it, here given,  shows the picturesqueness of roof outlines and the quaintness which  comes simply from variety. The front of the main building, with its  eight windows, all of different sizes and set at different heights,  shows equal diversity. Within, the boards in the wall-panelling vary  from two to twenty-five inches in width.    The windows of the first houses had oiled paper to admit light. A  colonist wrote back to England to a friend who was soon to follow,  \"Bring oiled paper for your windows.\" The minister, Higginson, sent  promptly in 1629 for glass for windows. This glass was set in the  windows with nails; the sashes were often narrow and oblong, of  diamond-shaped panes set in lead, and opening up and down the middle on  hinges. Long after the large towns and cities had glass windows,  frontier settlements still had heavy wooden shutters. They were a safer  protection against Indian assault, as well as cheaper. It is asserted  that in the province of Kennebec, which is now the state of Maine, there  was not, even as late as 1745, a house that had a square of glass in it.  Oiled paper was used until this century in pioneer houses for windows  wherever it was difficult to transport glass.    Few of the early houses in New England were painted, or colored, as it  was called, either without or within. Painters do not appear in any of  the early lists of workmen. A Salem citizen, just previous to the  Revolution, had the woodwork of one of the rooms of his house painted.  One of a group of friends, discussing this extravagance a few days  later, said: \"Well! Archer has set us a fine example of expense,--he has  laid one of his rooms in oil.\" This sentence shows both the wording and  ideas of the times.    There was one external and suggestive adjunct of the earliest pioneer's  home which was found in nearly all the settlements which were built in  the midst of threatening Indians. Some strong houses were always  surrounded by a stockade, or \"palisado,\" of heavy, well-fitted logs,  which thus formed a garrison, or neighborhood resort, in time of danger.  In the valley of Virginia each settlement was formed of houses set in a  square, connected from end to end of the outside walls by stockades  with gates; thus forming a close front. On the James River, on Manhattan  Island, were stockades. The whole town plot of Milford, Connecticut, was  enclosed in 1645, and the Indians taunted the settlers by shouting out,  \"White men all same like pigs.\" At one time in Massachusetts, twenty  towns proposed an all-surrounding palisade. The progress and condition  of our settlements can be traced in our fences. As Indians disappeared  or succumbed, the solid row of pales gave place to a log-fence, which  served well to keep out depredatory animals. When dangers from Indians  or wild animals entirely disappeared,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#3)"],[1,"obvious truth into more vehement  language than M. Venizelos: \"To tie Greece to the apron-strings of the  Sea Powers,\" was his maxim.  And the times were such that those Powers  needed a Greek statesman whom they could trust to apply that maxim  unflinchingly.    {5}    With the recovery of Greece synchronized, not by chance, the doom of  Turkey: a sentence in which all the members of the Entente, starting  from different points and pursuing different objects, concurred.  The  executioners were, naturally, the Balkan States.  Russia began the work  by bringing about an agreement between Bulgaria and Servia; England  completed it by bringing Greece into the League.  There ensued a local,  which, in accordance with the old diplomatic prophecy, was soon to lead  to the universal conflagration.  Organized as she was, Greece succeeded  better than anyone expected; and the national gratitude--the exuberant  gratitude of a Southern people--went out to the two men directly  responsible for that success: to King Constantine, whose brilliant  generalship beat the enemy hosts; and to M. Venizelos, whose able  statesmanship had prepared the field.  Poets and pamphleteers vied with  each other in expatiating on the wonders they had performed, to the  honour and advantage of their country.  In this ecstasy of popular  adoration the spirit of the soldier and the spirit of the lawyer seemed  to have met.    But the union was illusive and transient.  Between these two men, so  strangely flung together by destiny, there existed no link of sympathy;  and propinquity only forced the growth of their mutual antagonism.  The  seeds of discord had already borne fruit upon the common ground of  their Balkan exploits.  Immediately after the defeat of Turkey a  quarrel over the spoils arose among the victors.  King Constantine,  bearing in mind Bulgaria's long-cherished dream of hegemony, and  persuaded that no sacrifices made by Greece and Servia could do more  than defer a rupture, urged a Graeco-Servian alliance against their  truculent partner.  He looked at the matter from a purely Greek  standpoint and was anxious to secure the maximum of profit for his  country.  M. Venizelos, on the other hand, aware that the Western  Powers, and particularly England, wanted a permanent Balkan coalition  as a barrier against Germany in the East, and anxious to retain those  Powers' favour, was prepared to concede {6} much for the sake of  averting a rupture.  Not until the Bulgars betrayed their intentions by  actual aggressions in Macedonia did he withdraw his opposition to the  alliance with Servia, which ushered in the Second Balkan War and led to  the Peace of Bucharest.  He yielded to the pressure of the  circumstances brought to bear upon him; but the encounter represented  no more than the preliminary crossing of swords between two strong  antagonists.          {7}    CHAPTER I    From the moment when the rupture between Austria and Servia, in July,  1914, came to disturb the peace, Greece deliberately adopted an  attitude of neutrality, with the proviso that she would go to Servia's  assistance in case of a Bulgarian attack upon the latter.  Such an  attitude was considered to be in accordance with the Graeco-Servian  Alliance.  For, although the Military Convention accompanying the  Treaty contained a vague stipulation for mutual support in case of war  between one of the allied States and \"a third Power,\" the Treaty itself  had as its sole object mutual defence against Bulgaria.[1]    In the opinion of M. Venizelos, her pact did not oblige Greece to go to  Servia's assistance against Austria, but at most to mobilize 40,000  men.[2]  Treaty obligations apart, neutrality was also imposed by  practical considerations.  It was to the interest of Greece--a matter  of self-preservation--not to tolerate a Bulgarian attack on Servia  calculated to upset the Balkan balance of power established by the  Peace of Bucharest, and she was firmly determined, in concert with  Rumania, to oppose such an attack with all her might.  But as to  Austria, M. Venizelos had to consider whether Greece could or could not  offer her ally effective aid, and after consideration he decided that  she {8} should not proceed even to the mobilization of 40,000 men, for  such a measure might provoke a Bulgarian mobilization and precipitate  complications.  For the rest, the attitude of Greece in face of  Servia's war with Austria, M. Venizelos pointed out, corresponded  absolutely with the attitude which Servia had taken up in face of  Greece's recent crisis with Turkey.[3]  On that occasion Greece had  obtained from her ally merely moral support, the view taken being that  the _casus faederis_ would arise only in the event of Bulgarian  intervention.[4]    Accordingly, when the Servian Government asked if it could count on  armed assistance from Greece, M. Streit, Minister for Foreign Affairs  under M. Venizelos, answered that the Greek Government was convinced  that it fully performed its duty as a friend and ally by adopting,  until Bulgaria moved, a policy of most benevolent neutrality.  The  co-operation of Greece in the war with Austria, far from helping, would  harm Servia; by becoming a belligerent Greece could only offer her ally  forces negligible compared with the enemy's, while she would inevitably  expose Salonica, the only port through which Servia could obtain war  material, to an Austrian attack; and, moreover, she would weaken her  army which, in the common interest, ought to be kept intact as a check  on Bulgaria.[5]    A similar communication, emphasizing the decision to keep out of the  conflict, and to intervene in concert with Rumania only should Bulgaria  by intervening against Servia jeopardize the _status quo_ established  by the Bucharest Treaty--in which case the action of Greece would have  a purely Balkan character--was made to the Greek Ministers abroad after  a Council held in the Royal Palace under the presidency of the King.[6]    This policy brought King Constantine into sharp collision with one of  the Central Powers, whose conceptions in regard to the Balkans had not  yet been harmonized.  Vienna readily acquiesced in the Greek  Government's declaration that it could not permit Bulgaria to  compromise {9} the Bucharest Treaty, and since by an eventual action  against Bulgaria Greece would not quarrel with Austria, the Austrian  Government, on its part, promised to abstain from manifesting any  solidarity with Bulgaria in the event of a Graeco-Bulgarian war.[7]  Not so Berlin.    The German Emperor egotistically presumed to dictate the course which  Greece should pursue, and on 31 July he invited King Constantine to  join Germany, backing the invitation with every appeal to sentiment and  interest he could think of.  The memory of his father, who had been  assassinated, made it impossible for Constantine to favour the Servian  assassins; never would Greece have a better opportunity of emancipating  herself, under the protection of the Central Powers, from the tutelage  which Russia aimed at exercising over the Balkan Peninsula; if,  contrary to the Kaiser's expectations, Greece took the other side, she  would be exposed to a simultaneous attack from Italy, Bulgaria and  Turkey, and by the same token all personal relations between him and  Constantine would be broken for ever.  He ended with the words: \"I have  spoken frankly, and I beg you to let me know your decision without  delay and with the same absolute frankness.\"    He had nothing to complain of on that score.  King Constantine on 2  August replied that, while it was not the policy of Greece to take an  active part in the Austro-Servian conflict, it was equally impossible  for her \"to make common cause with the enemies of the Serbs and to fall  upon them, since they are our allies.  It seems to me that the  interests of Greece demand an absolute neutrality and the maintenance  of the _status quo_ in the Balkans such as it has been created by the  Treaty of Bucharest.\"  He went on to add that Greece was determined, in  concert with Rumania, to prevent Bulgaria from aggrandizing herself at  the expense of Servia; if that happened, the balance in the Balkans  would be upset and it would bring about the very Russian tutelage which  the Kaiser feared.  \"This way of thinking,\" he concluded, \"is shared by  the whole of my people.\"    What the Kaiser thought of these opinions was summed up in one word on  the margin, \"Rubbish.\"  This, however, was not meant for his  brother-in-law's ears.  To him he {10} used less terse language.  On 4  August he informed King Constantine through the Greek Minister in  Berlin that an alliance had that day been concluded between Germany and  Turkey, that Bulgaria and Rumania were similarly ranging themselves on  Germany's side, and that the German men-of-war in the Mediterranean  were going to join the Turkish fleet in order to act together.  Thus  all the Balkan States were siding with Germany in the struggle against  Slavism.  Would Greece alone stand out?  His Imperial Majesty appealed  to King Constantine as a comrade, as a German Field Marshal of whom the  German Army was proud, as a brother-in-law; he reminded him that it was  thanks to his support that Greece was allowed to retain Cavalla; he  begged him to mobilize his army, place himself by the Kaiser's side and  march hand in hand against the common enemy--Slavism.  He made this  urgent appeal for the last time, convinced that the King of Greece  would respond to it.  If not, all would be over between the two  countries--this being a slightly attenuated version of another marginal  note: \"I will treat Greece as an enemy if she does not adhere at once.\"    King Constantine's answer was tactful but final: His personal  sympathies and his political opinions, he said, were on the Kaiser's  side.  But alas! that which the Kaiser asked him to do was completely  out of the question.  Greece"]]]
