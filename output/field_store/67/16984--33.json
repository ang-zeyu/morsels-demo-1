Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself to the top,  with the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak  legs. He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find  an entrance-slit, nibbles it a little, renders it insensible and,  without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for  days on end.    When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;  and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint  stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in  the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually  converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which  the first attack was delivered. These small details tell us how  promptly the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how  dexterously the Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall  from a very slippery vertical support and without even shaking him on  his slight line of adhesion.    Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy  legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed  to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable. And this  apparatus the Lampyris possesses. At the hinder end of the animal we  see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short,  fleshy appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread  into a rosette. There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion. If he  would fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a  grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on  the support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness. The same  organ, rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist  the act of progression. In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of  self-propelled cripple, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty  white rose, a kind of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but  moving in every direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but  stick.    The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and  brush. At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and  repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder-parts, a  performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine. This is  done point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a  scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes  in the operation. What is his object in thus sponging himself, in  dusting and polishing himself so carefully? It is a question,  apparently, of removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of  viscidity that remain from the evil contact with the snail. A wash and  brush-up is not superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the  mollusc has been treated.    If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming  his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be  unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself  like a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving  fame. Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while  retaining her larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best  during the hottest part of summer. The lighting-apparatus occupies the  last three segments of the abdomen. On each of the first two, it takes  the form, on the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the  whole of the arch; on the third, the luminous part is much less and  consists simply of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two  spots which shine through to the back and are visible both above and  below the animal. Belts and spots emit a glorious white light,  delicately tinged with blue. The general lighting of the Glow-worm  thus comprises two groups: first, the wide belts of the two segments  preceding the last; secondly, the two spots of the final segments. The  two belts, the exclusive attribute of the marriageable female, are the  part richest in light: to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons  her brightest gauds; she lights her two resplendent scarves. But,  before that, from the time of the hatching, she had only the modest  rush-light of the stern. This efflorescence of light is the equivalent  of the final metamorphosis, which is usually represented by the gift  of wings and flight. Its brilliance heralds the pairing-time. Wings  and flight there will be none: the female retains her humble larval  form, but she kindles her blazing beacon.    The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,  acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he  possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end  segment. This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the  entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season. It appears  upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged. And we  must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on  the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the  female shine only under the abdomen.    My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were, but,  as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the  luminous organs. I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to  separate pretty neatly half of one of the shining belts. I place my  preparation under the microscope. On the skin, a sort of white-wash  lies spread, formed of a very fine, granular substance. This is  certainly the light-producing matter. To examine this white layer more  closely is beyond the power of my weary eyes. Just beside it is a  curious air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches  suddenly into a sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.  These creep over the luminous sheet, or even dip into it. That is all.    The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs  and the work produced is an oxidization. The white sheet supplies the  oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush  distributes the flow of air over it. There remains the question of the  substance whereof this sheet is formed. The first suggestion was  phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word. The Glow-worm has been  calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple  substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a  satisfactory answer along these lines. Phosphorus seems to play no  part here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes  bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam. The answer lies elsewhere, no one  knows where.    We are better informed as regards another question. Has the Glow-worm  a free control of the light which he emits? Can he turn it on or down  or put it out as he pleases? Has he an opaque screen which is drawn  over the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed? There is  no need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for  its revolving light.    The thick tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the flow  of air and the light is intensified; the same air-tube, swayed by the  animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the  light grows fainter or even goes out. It is, in short, the mechanism  of a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.    Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion. We must here  distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the  exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the  modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any  age. In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden  and complete, or nearly so. In my nocturnal hunts for young  Glow-worms, measuring about 5 millimetres long,[3] I can plainly see  the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the least false step  disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at once and the  coveted insect becomes invisible. Upon the full-grown females, lit up  with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has but a slight  effect and often none at all.    [Footnote 3: .195 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my  menagerie of females in the open air. The explosion produces no  result. The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before. I  take a spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the  flock. Not one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most,  there is a brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases. I  send a puff of smoke from my pipe into the cage. This time, the pause  is more marked. There are even some extinctions, but these do not last  long. Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.  I take some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease  them a little. The illumination continues and is not much diminished,  if I do not press too hard with my thumb. At this period, with the  pairing close at hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its  passionate splendour; and nothing short of very serious reasons would  make it put out its signals altogether.    All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm  himself manages his lighting-apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling  it at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of  the insect is without effect. I detach a strip of the epidermis  showing one of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube,  which I close with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid too rapid an  evaporation. Well, this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although  not quite as brilliantly as on the living body.    Life's aid is now superfluous. The oxidizable substance, the  luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding  atmosphere; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#3)"],[1,"round,  never heeding his poor clothes, but eying him respectfully and waiting  eagerly to hear him play again.    They chose a song he knew; and after one or two false starts they got  going, and violin, flute, and piano led a chorus of boyish voices that  made the old roof ring again. It was too much for Nat, more feeble than  he knew; and as the final shout died away, his face began to work, he  dropped the fiddle, and turning to the wall sobbed like a little child.    \"My dear, what is it?\" asked Mrs. Bhaer, who had been singing with all  her might, and trying to keep little Rob from beating time with his  boots.    \"You are all so kind and it's so beautiful I can't help it,\" sobbed Nat,  coughing till he was breathless.    \"Come with me, dear; you must go to bed and rest; you are worn out, and  this is too noisy a place for you,\" whispered Mrs. Bhaer; and took him  away to her own parlor, where she let him cry himself quiet.    Then she won him to tell her all his troubles, and listened to the  little story with tears in her own eyes, though it was not a new one to  her.    \"My child, you have got a father and a mother now, and this is home.  Don't think of those sad times any more, but get well and happy; and be  sure you shall never suffer again, if we can help it. This place is made  for all sorts of boys to have a good time in, and to learn how to help  themselves and be useful men, I hope. You shall have as much music as  you want, only you must get strong first. Now come up to Nursey and have  a bath, and then go to bed, and to-morrow we will lay some nice little  plans together.\"    Nat held her hand fast in his, but had not a word to say, and let his  grateful eyes speak for him, as Mrs. Bhaer led him up to a big room,  where they found a stout German woman with a face so round and cheery  that it looked like a sort of sun, with the wide frill of her cap for  rays.    \"This is Nursey Hummel, and she will give you a nice bath, and cut your  hair, and make you all 'comfy,' as Rob says. That's the bath-room in  there; and on Saturday nights we scrub all the little lads first, and  pack them away in bed before the big ones get through singing. Now then,  Rob, in with you.\"    As she talked, Mrs. Bhaer had whipped off Rob's clothes and popped him  into a long bath-tub in the little room opening into the nursery.    There were two tubs, besides foot-baths, basins, douche-pipes, and all  manner of contrivances for cleanliness. Nat was soon luxuriating in the  other bath; and while simmering there, he watched the performances of  the two women, who scrubbed, clean night-gowned, and bundled into bed  four or five small boys, who, of course, cut up all sorts of capers  during the operation, and kept every one in a gale of merriment till  they were extinguished in their beds.    By the time Nat was washed and done up in a blanket by the fire, while  Nursey cut his hair, a new detachment of boys arrived and were shut into  the bath-room, where they made as much splashing and noise as a school  of young whales at play.    \"Nat had better sleep here, so that if his cough troubles him in the  night you can see that he takes a good draught of flax-seed tea,\" said  Mrs. Bhaer, who was flying about like a distracted hen with a large  brood of lively ducklings.    Nursey approved the plan, finished Nat off with a flannel night-gown, a  drink of something warm and sweet, and then tucked him into one of the  three little beds standing in the room, where he lay looking like a  contented mummy and feeling that nothing more in the way of luxury  could be offered him. Cleanliness in itself was a new and delightful  sensation; flannel gowns were unknown comforts in his world; sips of  \"good stuff\" soothed his cough as pleasantly as kind words did his  lonely heart; and the feeling that somebody cared for him made that  plain room seem a sort of heaven to the homeless child. It was like a  cosy dream; and he often shut his eyes to see if it would not vanish  when he opened them again. It was too pleasant to let him sleep, and he  could not have done so if he had tried, for in a few minutes one of the  peculiar institutions of Plumfield was revealed to his astonished but  appreciative eyes.    A momentary lull in the aquatic exercises was followed by the sudden  appearance of pillows flying in all directions, hurled by white goblins,  who came rioting out of their beds. The battle raged in several rooms,  all down the upper hall, and even surged at intervals into the nursery,  when some hard-pressed warrior took refuge there. No one seemed to  mind this explosion in the least; no one forbade it, or even looked  surprised. Nursey went on hanging up towels, and Mrs. Bhaer laid out  clean clothes, as calmly as if the most perfect order reigned. Nay,  she even chased one daring boy out of the room, and fired after him the  pillow he had slyly thrown at her.    \"Won't they hurt 'em?\" asked Nat, who lay laughing with all his might.    \"Oh dear, no! We always allow one pillow-fight Saturday night. The cases  are changed to-morrow; and it gets up a glow after the boys' baths; so  I rather like it myself,\" said Mrs. Bhaer, busy again among her dozen  pairs of socks.    \"What a very nice school this is!\" observed Nat, in a burst of  admiration.    \"It's an odd one,\" laughed Mrs. Bhaer, \"but you see we don't believe  in making children miserable by too many rules, and too much study. I  forbade night-gown parties at first; but, bless you, it was of no use.  I could no more keep those boys in their beds than so many jacks in the  box. So I made an agreement with them: I was to allow a fifteen-minute  pillow-fight every Saturday night; and they promised to go properly to  bed every other night. I tried it, and it worked well. If they don't  keep their word, no frolic; if they do, I just turn the glasses round,  put the lamps in safe places, and let them rampage as much as they  like.\"    \"It's a beautiful plan,\" said Nat, feeling that he should like to join  in the fray, but not venturing to propose it the first night. So he lay  enjoying the spectacle, which certainly was a lively one.    Tommy Bangs led the assailing party, and Demi defended his own room with  a dogged courage fine to see, collecting pillows behind him as fast as  they were thrown, till the besiegers were out of ammunition, when they  would charge upon him in a body, and recover their arms. A few slight  accidents occurred, but nobody minded, and gave and took sounding  thwacks with perfect good humor, while pillows flew like big snowflakes,  till Mrs. Bhaer looked at her watch, and called out:    \"Time is up, boys. Into bed, every man jack, or pay the forfeit!\"    \"What is the forfeit?\" asked Nat, sitting up in his eagerness to know  what happened to those wretches who disobeyed this most peculiar, but  public-spirited school-ma'am.    \"Lose their fun next time,\" answered Mrs. Bhaer. \"I give them five  minutes to settle down, then put out the lights, and expect order. They  are honorable lads, and they keep their word.\"    That was evident, for the battle ended as abruptly as it began, a parting  shot or two, a final cheer, as Demi fired the seventh pillow at the  retiring foe, a few challenges for next time, then order prevailed. And  nothing but an occasional giggle or a suppressed whisper broke the quiet  which followed the Saturday-night frolic, as Mother Bhaer kissed her new  boy and left him to happy dreams of life at Plumfield.        CHAPTER II. THE BOYS    While Nat takes a good long sleep, I will tell my little readers  something about the boys, among whom he found himself when he woke up.    To begin with our old friends. Franz was a tall lad, of sixteen now, a  regular German, big, blond, and bookish, also very domestic, amiable,  and musical. His uncle was fitting him for college, and his aunt for a  happy home of his own hereafter, because she carefully fostered in him  gentle manners, love of children, respect for women, old and young,  and helpful ways about the house. He was her right-hand man on all  occasions, steady, kind, and patient; and he loved his merry aunt like a  mother, for such she had tried to be to him.    Emil was quite different, being quick-tempered, restless, and  enterprising, bent on going to sea, for the blood of the old vikings  stirred in his veins, and could not be tamed. His uncle promised that he  should go when he was sixteen, and set him to studying navigation, gave  him stories of good and famous admirals and heroes to read, and let him  lead the life of a frog in river, pond, and brook, when lessons were  done. His room looked like the cabin of a man-of-war, for every thing  was nautical, military, and shipshape. Captain Kyd was his delight, and  his favorite amusement was to rig up like that piratical gentleman, and  roar out sanguinary sea-songs at the top of his voice. He would dance  nothing but sailors' hornpipes, rolled in his gait, and was as  nautical in conversation to his uncle would permit. The boys called him  \"Commodore,\" and took great pride in his fleet, which whitened the  pond and suffered disasters that would have daunted any commander but a  sea-struck boy.    Demi was one of the children who show plainly the effect of intelligent  love and care, for soul and body worked harmoniously together. The  natural refinement which nothing but home influence can teach, gave  him sweet and simple manners: his mother had cherished an innocent and  loving heart in him; his father had watched over the physical growth of  his boy, and kept the little body straight and strong on wholesome food  and exercise and sleep, while Grandpa March cultivated the little mind  with the tender wisdom of a modern Pythagoras, not tasking it with long,  hard lessons, parrot-learned, but helping it to unfold as naturally and  beautifully as sun and dew help roses bloom. He was not a perfect child,  by any means, but his faults"]]]
