They make  his empire richer in men and money - commodities of which Mexico  has sorely felt the want.    Once when a Methodist clergyman went to Diaz, remonstrated against  that polygamy which he permitted, and spoke of immoralities, Diaz  snapped his fingers.    \"Do you see their children?\" cried Diaz. \"Well, I think more of  their children than of your arguments.\"    From this Mexican nursery the Mormon President can, when he will,  order an emigration into Nevada or any of those other States I've  mentioned, to support the Church where it is weakest. Moreover,  as related, the settlements in Mexico offer a haven of retreat  should any tempest of prosecution beat upon the Utah polygamists  through some slip of policy or accidental Gentile strength.    In Nevada, in Colorado, in Oregon, in Idaho, in every one of  those States wherein the Church has planted the standards of  Mormonism, the Mormon, as fast as he may, is making himself a  power in politics. He is never a Democrat, never a Republican,  always a Mormon. What sparks of independent political action  broke into brief, albeit fiery, life a few years ago were fairly  beaten out when Thatcher and Roberts were punished for daring to  act outside the Mormon command.    Now, pretend what they will, assert what lie they choose, the  Mormon President holds the Mormon vote, in whatever State it  abides, in the hollow of his hand. He can, and does, place it to  this or that party's support, according as he makes his bargain.  He will use it to elect legislators and Congressmen in those  States. He will employ it to select the Senators whom those  States send to Washington. And when they are there, as Smoot is  there, for the safeguarding of polygamy and what other crimes  Mormonism may find it convenient to rest upon from time to time,  those Senators and Representatives will act by the Mormon  President's orders. \"When the lion's hide is too short,\" said the  Greek, \"I piece it out with foxes.\" And the Mormons, in a day  when the Danites have gone with those who called them into bloody  being, and murder as a Churchly argument is no longer safe,  profit by the Grecian's wisdom.    But the darkest side of Mormonism is seen when one considers the  stamp of moral and mental degradation it sets upon those men and  women who comprise what one might term the peasantry of the  Church. Woman is, as the effect of Mormonism, peculiarly made to  retrograde. Instead of being uplifted she is beaten down. She  must not think; she must not feel; she must not know; she must  not love. Her only safety lies in being blind and deaf and dull  and senseless to every better sentiment of womanhood. She is to  divide a husband with one or two or ten or twenty; she is not to  be a wife, but the fraction of a wife. The moment she looks upon  herself as anything other than a bearer of children she is lost.  Should she rebel - and in her helplessness she does not know how  to enter upon practical revolt - she becomes an outcast; a  creature of no shelter, no food, no friend, no home. Woman is the  basis or, if you will, the source and fountain of a race; woman  is a race's inspiration. And what shall a race be, what shall its  children be, with so lowered and befouled an origin?    At the hearing before the Senate Committee President Smith,  stroking his long white beard in the manner of the patriarchs,  made no secret of his five wives, and seemed to court the Gentile  condemnation. This hardihood was of deliberate plan on the part  of President Smith. He was inviting what he would call \"persecution.\"  He did not fear actual prosecution in the Utah courts; as to the  Federal forums, those tribunals were powerless against him now  that Utah was a State. Being safe in the flesh, President Smith  would bring upon himself and Mormonism the whole fury of the  press. It would serve to quiet schism and bicker within the  Mormon Church. An opposition or a \"persecution\" would act as a  pressure to bring Mormons together. That pressure would squeeze  out the last drop of political independence among Mormons, which  to the extent that it existed might interfere with his disposal  of the compact Mormon vote. In short, an attack upon himself and  upon Mormonism by the Gentiles would tighten the hold of  President Smith, close-herd the Mormons, and leave them ready  politically to be driven hither and yon as seemed most profitable  for Church purposes.    Gray, wise, crafty, sly, soft, one who carries mendacity to the  heights of art, President Smith gives in all he says and does and  looks the color of truth to this explanation of his frankness. He  would not prodigiously care if Smoot were cast into outer Senate  darkness. It would not be an evil past a remedy. He could send  Smoot back; and send him back again. Meanwhile, he might lift up  the cry of the Church persecuted; that of itself would stiffen  the Mormon line of battle and multiply recruits.    President Smith looks forward to a time when one Senate vote will  be decisive. He cannot prophesy the day; but by the light of what  has been, he knows that it must dawn. About a decade ago the  Democrats took the Senate from the Republicans by one vote -  Senator Peffer's. In Garfield's day the Senate, before Conkling  stepped down and out, was in even balance with a tie. What was,  will be; and President Smith intends, when that moment arrives  and the Senate is in poise between the parties, to have at least  one Utah vote, and as many more as he may, to be a stock in trade  wherewith to traffic security for his Church of Mormon and its  crimes. Given a balance of power in the Senate - and it might  easily come within his hands - President Smith could enforce such  liberal terms for Mormonism as to privilege it in its sins and  prevent chance of punishment.    There be those who, for a Mormon or a personal political reason,  will find fault with this work and its now appearance in print;  they will argue that some motive of politics underlies the  publication. It is fair to state that in so arguing they will be  right. The motive is three-ply - made up of a purpose to  withstand the Mormon Church as a political force, limit its  spread as a so-called religion, and buckler the mothers and  daughters and sisters of the country against an enemy whose  advances are aimed peculiarly at them. The morals of a people are  in the custody of its women; and, against Mormonism - that  sleepless menace to American morality - these confessions of Lee  the Danite are set in types to become a weapon in their hands. It  was the womanhood of the nation that compelled the present Senate  investigation of Smoot and what Mormon influences and conspiracies  produced him as their representative; and it is for a defense of  womanhood and its purity that this book is made. The battle will  not be wholly won with Smoot's eviction from his Senate seat;  indeed, the going of Smoot will be only an incident. The war  should continue until all of Mormonism and what it stands for is  destroyed; for then, and not before, may wifehood or womanhood  write itself safe between the oceans. Congress must not alone  cleanse itself of Smoot; it must go forward to methods that shall  save the politics of the country from a least of Mormon interference,  and the aroused womanhood of the land should compel Congress to  this work. He who would hold his house above his head must mind  repairs, and the word is quite as true when spoken of a country.    Alfred Henry Lewis. New York City,    December 15, 1904.        THE MORMON MENACE OR, THE CONFESSIONS OF JOHN DOYLE LEE        CHAPTER I - THE STORMY YOUTH OF LEE    In justice to myself, my numerous family, and the public in  general, I consider it my duty to write a history of my life. I  shall content myself with giving facts, and let the readers draw  their own conclusion therefrom. By the world at large I am called  a criminal, and have been sentenced to be shot for deeds  committed by myself and others nearly twenty years ago. I have  acted my religion, nothing more. I have obeyed the orders of the  Church. I have acted as I was commanded to do by my superiors. My  sins, if any, are the result of doing what I was commanded to do  by those who were my superiors in authority in the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    My birthday was the 6th day of September, A.D. 1812. I was born  in the town of Kaskaskia, Randolph County, Illinois. My father,  Ralph Lee, was born in the State of Virginia. He was of the  family of Lees of Revolutionary fame. He served his time as an  apprentice and learned the carpenter's trade in the city of  Baltimore. My mother was born in Nashville, Tennessee. She was  the daughter of John Doyle, who for many years held the position  of Indian Agent over the roving tribes of Indians in southeastern  Illinois. He served in the War of the Revolution, and was wounded  in one of the many battles in which he took part with the sons of  liberty against the English oppressors.    At the time of my birth my father was considered one of the  leading men of that section of country; he was a master workman,  sober and attentive to business, prompt and punctual to his  engagements. He contracted largely and carried on a heavy  business; he erected a magnificent mansion, for that age and  country, on his land adjoining the town of Kaskaskia.    This tract of land was the property of my mother when she married  my father. My grandfather Doyle was a wealthy man. He died in  1809 at Kaskaskia, Illinois, and left his whole fortune to my  mother and her sister Charlotte, by will. They being his only  children, he divided the property equally between them.    My father and mother were both Catholics, were raised in that  faith; I was christened in that Church. When about one year old,  my mother being sick, I was sent to a French nurse, a negro  woman. At this time my sister Eliza was eleven years old,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#3)"],[1,"is to me a revelation of bombast,  self-righteousness, falsehood, and hypocrisy. What shocks one most is  the familiar and perpetual calling upon God to witness that He alone  has led the Germans to victory and blessed their cause. I read a poem  yesterday, which began \"Du Gott der Deutschen,\" as if indeed the Deity  were the especial property of the German Nation! Massacre, pillage,  destruction, violation of territory, everything wicked God is supposed  to bless! What hideously distorted minds, and where is the sane, if  prosaic Teuton of one's imaginings! I wake often in the morning and  wonder if all that has happened here has not been a horrible  nightmare--if it can be possible in the twentieth century that I, a  woman, am a prisoner, and for no sin that one has committed. I cannot  order an Einspaenner and drive to the station without a challenge and  danger. I cannot possibly get away without my passport. If I attempted  to drive to the Rhine my fate might be that of the poor Russians who  were shot the other day. In any case I could not leave Germany without  my passport nor enter Dutch territory without permission from the  Netherlands Consul at Frankfort. It seems all hopeless and  heartbreaking.    _August 20th._--Another terrific blow! Fraulein S---- came into my  room this morning and said: \"Kein Englaender, kein Auslaender, kann  Deutschland verlassen\" (no Englishman, no foreigner can leave  Germany). I rushed off immediately to the Polizei Amt and found it  only too terribly true. Worse! Mr. W---- and Mr. S----, who tried to  arrange for a steamer on the Rhine to take us away, have been  arrested, and are being tried on a trumped-up charge of _forgery_, and  the Company who were the go-betweens demand 3,000 marks because the  boat came a certain distance down the river in order to embark us.    (_Later_) The Englishmen have been acquitted of forgery, but we fear  we shall have to pay the L120. I have one mark left!    There is jubilation all over the town as the Germans have taken  Belfort. Kaethchen enters triumphantly. \"Unter Fuehrung des Kronprinzen  von Bayern haben Truppen gestern in Schlachten zwischen Metz und den  Vogesen noch einen Sieg erkaempft,\" and she goes on with the weary old  story of \"viele tausend Gefangene\" (many thousand prisoners).    _August 21st._--I found that charming old American friends of mine,  the W----s, were here, and I went to see them at the Grand Hotel. They  have been to a Nach Kur in Thuringia, and have had most alarming and  unpleasant adventures coming back. However, being American their pains  and penalties are nearly over. A special train is to take them and  their compatriots to the Hague on Wednesday next. They go to the  flesh-pots of Egypt, and we are left to eat manna in the wilderness!  They can drive in the country, while we poor Britishers may not go  outside the town, and oh! how sick we are of the avenues and streets  of the red-roofed Bath Houses and shop windows whose contents we know  by heart. Mr. W---- told me a good tale of the _chef_ of a Hotel here,  who was obliged to obey his country's call and join the French forces.  When he found German bullets whizzing about him at Muelhausen, he said  to himself (so the story goes), \"What is my duty? Is it best for me to  let these cursed Germans make an end of me, or live to cook another  day for my country?\" He decided that living was his game, threw his  rifle away, lay flat on his face, and let the bullets whistle over  him. He was taken prisoner to his great relief, and now lies in  Frankfort prison where his German brother chef has visited him! The  French of course are a brave nation, but I daresay the poor cook was  more at home with his pots and pans than with bayonets and rifles!    No papers! no letters! no news! no chance of escape! Two men were put  in prison yesterday for laughing at Germany. Two Russians were stopped  in a motor car, and when arms were found upon them they were put up  against a wall and shot.    _August 22nd._--Altheim has gone mad with joy over the victory near  Metz. Church bells chime and German children sing \"Deutschland ueber  Alles\" _ad nauseam_; and the Kur Haus and all private dwellings are  draped with bunting. Red Cross people are busy preparing for the  wounded--sewing classes are held every day in Bad Haus 8, and the  doctors are full of work. Mr. S----, a young Englishman, formerly in  the army, has been arrested, and also the hall-porter of the \"Grand,\"  and two English valets.    _August 24th._--A terrible day! First of all Kaethchen announced with  complacency and obvious triumph, that there had been a great victory  \"ganz herrlich!\" and that an English Cavalry Brigade had been cut to  pieces at Luneville, and that those who were not killed had \"run  away\"! Of course I did not believe this, but it made one terribly  anxious. Then in came Miss H---- saying that two men of our little  colony had been arrested and taken to the police-station, whence after  examination they were to be sent to Frankfurt. At the Polizei Amt the  Officials exhibited the results of their _Kultur_ by being rude and  rough to the unfortunate people arrested. A Polish woman whose son had  been made prisoner sobbed and cried, whereupon the grim old inspector  came into the room and said sternly: \"Kein Frauen Jammer hier!\"  ordering her out of the room. I was in the Park Strasse and heard some  Germans chuckling and saying: \"Zwei Englaender sind verhaftet\" (two  Englishmen are arrested), looked round, and saw two of our little  community, both service men, following each other in Einspaenners, each  surrounded by soldiers and fixed bayonets. It was anything but a  pleasing sight to me!    _August 25th._--The clouds are lifting, thank God! Cheering news has  come that we are to be allowed to leave this delightful country in  eight days' time; most likely we shall have to travel either by way of  Switzerland or Denmark. Those sagacious personages in Berlin seem to  imagine that the secrets of the Rhine fortresses will reveal  themselves to us as we go by! What a compliment to our powers of  clairvoyance!    Fraulein G---- has just been in to see me. Usually she is a most  pleasant, gentle little woman, kind and charming; now she is full of  scorn and hatred of England. She says the Englishmen were arrested  because they were heard to say that German papers were \"full of lies.\"  \"So they are,\" said I, \"and you can go now and get me arrested too.\"  \"Oh, no,\" said she, \"I would not tell on _you_!\" In spite of her  magnanimity I cannot think our interview was a success. We argued  until I said, \"If we are to remain friends, we must not discuss the  war. I _can_not think England wrong, and as a loyal German you think  Germany right. Don't let us talk about it any more.\"    The \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" declares that no workmen in England will  fight for their country, only the \"mercenaries\" who are well paid to  risk their lives. Oh, this life is hard to bear! Such intense,  frightful hatred speaks in every look, in every action of our enemies.  It is consoling to remember that their own Nietzsche says: \"One does  not hate as long as one dis-esteems, and only when one esteems an  equal or superior.\"    _August 26th._--A chauffeur at the Bellevue was arrested to-day and  taken to Frankfort. He is only twenty, a Glasgow lad, and absolutely  harmless.    I am so sick of \"Heil Dir im Sieger Kranz\" that as the children pass  my villa shouting it or \"Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?\" I go out on  my balcony and retaliate by singing \"Rule Britannia.\" Small children  with flags and paper cocked hats, toy swords and tiny drums march  through the streets, day after day, singing patriotic songs, whilst  (poor dears!) their fathers are being slaughtered in thousands. No  reverses are ever reported in the German papers, nothing but victories  appear, and Germans are treated like children. If it were not for the  \"Corriere della Sera\" we should be tempted to believe the Allies in a  bad way. The \"beehrte gaeste\" departed this morning. At the station a  band played, flags were waved, and every American man and woman was  presented with a small white book which contained the telegrams which  passed between the belligerent nations at the beginning of the war.  Again we hear that Copenhagen is to be our destination.    [Illustration: IN POLYNESIEN  (The German idea of an Australian)]    _August 27th._--I saw Dr. G---- this morning. He begged me to be most  careful what I said. Two patients of his (English) Levantines were  talking on the Terrace, and one said to the other, \"We had better  shave off our moustaches, or we shall be taken for military men.\" They  were promptly arrested, having been overheard by a spy. We are now  ordered to get health certificates, which are to go to Frankfort, and  be forwarded to the military authorities in Berlin. There is an idea  that we may go away on Tuesday next. We have found out that our  passports never went to Berlin at all, but are lying at this moment in  the drawer of that old demon in the \"Polizei-Amt.\"    _August 28th._--Nothing new. The German papers, as usual, full of  their victories and their piety, and their patriotism, and their  \"Kultur,\" and goodness knows what not besides. Both Kaisers praising  each other and distributing iron crosses _ad lib._, early though it be  in the day. No mention of English troops or England, except to abuse  the \"Verfluechte\" English.    A train of wounded men arrived yesterday, and bandaged and lame  soldiers are to be seen limping about the town, looking ghastly pale  and ill. At the Lazarett behind the \"Prince of Wales' Hotel\" there are  many sad cases. The Red Cross Society has made every provision for  their comfort and happiness possible. Sheets have been hemmed, pillow  cases sewn, bandages got ready. The Germans, however, are chary of  admitting English women to share their labours, and those who go and  offer"]]]
