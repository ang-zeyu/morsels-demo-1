[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#3)"],[1,"about one or two key future  trends.    Birth rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of births  during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also  known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant  factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both  the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.    Budget:  This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital  expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Capital:  This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its  geographic coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if  applicable, information on daylight saving time (DST). Where  appropriate, a special note has been added to highlight those countries  that have multiple time zones.    Climate:  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather  regimes throughout the year.    Coastline:  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between  the land area (including islands) and the sea.    Communications:  This category deals with the means of exchanging  information and includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet  host entries.    Communications - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous  communications information of significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution:  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,  and major amendments.    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):  UTC is the international atomic time  scale that serves as the basis of timekeeping for most of the world.  The hours, minutes, and seconds expressed by UTC represent the time of  day at the Prime Meridian (0 deg. longitude) located near Greenwich,  England as reckoned from midnight. UTC is calculated by the Bureau  International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM  averages data collected from more than 200 atomic time and frequency  standards located at about 50 laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis  for all civil time with the Earth divided into time zones expressed as  positive or negative differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to as  \"Zulu time.\" See the Standard Time Zones of the World map included with  the Reference Maps.    Country data codes:  see Data codes    Country map:  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in  color. The maps were produced from the best information available at  the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed  subsequently.    Country name:  This entry includes all forms of the country's name  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an  example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional short  form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form  (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also  see the Terminology note.    Crude oil:  See entry for oil.    Currency (code):  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange  and, in parenthesis, gives the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.    Current account balance:  This entry records a country's net trade in  goods and services, plus net earnings from rents, interest, profits,  and dividends, and net transfer payments (such as pension funds and  worker remittances) to and from the rest of the world during the period  specified. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Data codes:  This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-  Reference List of Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference  List of Hydrographic Data Codes.    Date of information:  In general, information available as of 1 January  2007, was used in the preparation of this edition.    Daylight Saving Time (DST):  This entry is included for those entities  that have adopted a policy of adjusting the official local time  forward, usually one hour, from Standard Time during summer months.  Such policies are most common in mid-latitude regions.    Death rate:  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths  during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude  death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the  mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current  mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly  affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a  rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in  mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging  population.    Debt - external:  This entry gives the total public and private debt  owed to nonresidents repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Dependency status:  This entry describes the formal relationship  between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas:  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all  nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular  independent state.    Diplomatic representation:  The US Government has diplomatic relations  with 188 independent states, including 187 of the 192 UN members  (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US  itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 1  independent state that is not in the UN, the Holy See, as well as with  the EU.    Diplomatic representation from the US:  This entry includes the chief  of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX  number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and  consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation in the US:  This entry includes the chief of  mission, chancery, telephone, FAX, consulate general locations, and  consulate locations.    Disputes - international:  This entry includes a wide variety of  situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to  unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding  disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has  been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other  situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as  resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;  however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index:  This index measures the  degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country.  The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative  family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from  the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area  between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b)  the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly  equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to  the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian  country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income  distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and  the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of  50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve  would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if  income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would  coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the  index would be 100.    Economic aid - donor:  This entry refers to net official development  assistance (ODA) from Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) nations to developing countries and multilateral  organizations. ODA is defined as financial assistance that is  concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic  development and welfare of the less developed countries (LDCs), and  contains a grant element of at least 25%. The entry does not cover  other official flows (OOF) or private flows. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Economic aid - recipient:  This entry, which is subject to major  problems of definition and statistical coverage, refers to the net  inflow of Official Development Finance (ODF) to recipient countries.  The figure includes assistance from the World Bank, the IMF, and other  international organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal  commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from the data are  grants by private organizations. Aid comes in various forms including  outright grants and loans. The entry thus is the difference between new  inflows and repayments. These figures are calculated on an exchange  rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Economy:  This category includes the entries dealing with the size,  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor,  and capital.    Economy - overview:  This entry briefly describes the type of economy,  including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic  development, the most important natural resources, and the unique areas  of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and  policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a statement  about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption:  This entry consists of total electricity  generated annually plus imports and minus exports, expressed in  kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity  generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is  accounted for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2735"],[0,"The Golden Dog (#3)"],[1,"Beauharnais was the ancestor of a  vigorous and beautiful race, among whose posterity was the fair Hortense  de Beauharnais, who in her son, Napoleon III., seated an offshoot of  Canada upon the imperial throne of France long after the abandonment of  their ancient colony by the corrupt House of Bourbon.    Conspicuous among the distinguished officers by his tall, straight  figure and quick movements, was the Chevalier La Corne St. Luc, supple  as an Indian, and almost as dark, from exposure to the weather and  incessant campaigning. He was fresh from the blood and desolation of  Acadia, where France, indeed, lost her ancient colony, but St. Luc  reaped a full sheaf of glory at Grand Pre, in the Bay of Minas, by the  capture of an army of New Englanders. The rough old soldier was just now  all smiles and gaiety, as he conversed with Monseigneur de Pontbriant,  the venerable Bishop of Quebec, and Father de Berey, the Superior of the  Recollets.    The Bishop, a wise ruler of his Church, was also a passionate lover of  his country: the surrender of Quebec to the English broke his heart, and  he died a few months after the announcement of the final cession of the  Colony.    Father de Berey, a jovial monk, wearing the gray gown and sandals of the  Recollets, was renowned throughout New France for his wit more than for  his piety. He had once been a soldier, and he wore his gown, as he had  worn his uniform, with the gallant bearing of a King's Guardsman. But  the people loved him all the more for his jests, which never lacked the  accompaniment of genuine charity. His sayings furnished all New France  with daily food for mirth and laughter, without detracting an iota of  the respect in which the Recollets were held throughout the colony.    Father Glapion, the Superior of the Jesuits, also accompanied the  Bishop. His close, black soutane contrasted oddly with the gray, loose  gown of the Recollet. He was a meditative, taciturn man,--seeming rather  to watch the others than to join in the lively conversation that went on  around him. Anything but cordiality and brotherly love reigned between  the Jesuits and the Order of St. Francis, but the Superiors were too  wary to manifest towards each other the mutual jealousies of their  subordinates.    The long line of fortifications presented a stirring appearance that  morning. The watch-fires that had illuminated the scene during the night  were dying out, the red embers paling under the rays of the rising sun.  From a wide circle surrounding the city the people had come in--many  were accompanied by their wives and daughters--to assist in making the  bulwark of the Colony impregnable against the rumored attack of the  English.    The people of New France, taught by a hundred years of almost constant  warfare with the English and with the savage nations on their frontiers,  saw as clearly as the Governor that the key of French dominion hung  inside the walls of Quebec, and that for an enemy to grasp it was to  lose all they valued as subjects of the Crown of France.        CHAPTER II. THE WALLS OF QUEBEC.      Count de la Galissoniere, accompanied by his distinguished attendants,  proceeded again on their round of inspection. They were everywhere  saluted with heads uncovered, and welcomed by hearty greetings. The  people of New France had lost none of the natural politeness and ease of  their ancestors, and, as every gentleman of the Governor's suite was at  once recognized, a conversation, friendly even to familiarity, ensued  between them and the citizens and habitans, who worked as if they were  building their very souls into the walls of the old city.    \"Good morning, Sieur de St. Denis!\" gaily exclaimed the Governor to a  tall, courtly gentleman, who was super-intending the labor of a body of  his censitaires from Beauport. \"'Many hands make light work,' says the  proverb. That splendid battery you are just finishing deserves to be  called Beauport. What say you, my Lord Bishop?\" turning to the smiling  ecclesiastic. \"Is it not worthy of baptism?\"    \"Yes, and blessing both; I give it my episcopal benediction,\" replied  the Bishop, \"and truly I think most of the earth of it is taken from the  consecrated ground of the Hotel Dieu--it will stand fire!\"    \"Many thanks, my Lord!\"--the Sieur de St. Denis bowed very low--\"where  the Church bars the door Satan will never enter, nor the English either!  Do you hear, men?\" continued he, turning to his censitaires, \"my Lord  Bishop christens our battery Beauport, and says it will stand fire!\"    \"Vive le Roi!\" was the response, an exclamation that came spontaneously  to the lips of all Frenchmen on every emergency of danger or emotion of  joy.    A sturdy habitan came forward, and doffing his red tuque or cap,  addressed the Governor: \"This is a good battery, my Lord Governor, but  there ought to be one as good in our village. Permit us to build one and  man it, and we promise your Excellency that no Englishman shall ever get  into the back door of Quebec while we have lives to defend it.\" The old  habitan had the eye of a soldier--he had been one. The Governor knew the  value of the suggestion, and at once assented to it, adding, \"No better  defenders of the city could be found anywhere than the brave habitans of  Beauport.\"    The compliment was never forgotten; and years afterwards, when Wolfe  besieged the city, the batteries of Beauport repelled the assault of his  bravest troops, and well-nigh broke the heart of the young hero over the  threatened defeat of his great undertaking, as his brave Highlanders and  grenadiers lay slain by hundreds upon the beach of Beauport.    The countenances of the hardy workers were suddenly covered with smiles  of welcome recognition at the sight of the well-known Superior of the  Recollets.    \"Good morning!\" cried out a score of voices; \"good morning, Father de  Berey! The good wives of Beauport send you a thousand compliments.  They are dying to see the good Recollets down our way again. The Gray  Brothers have forsaken our parish.\"    \"Ah!\" replied the Superior, in a tone of mock severity, while his eyes  overran with mirthfulness, \"you are a crowd of miserable sinners who  will die without benefit of clergy--only you don't know it! Who was it  boiled the Easter eggs hard as agates, which you gave to my poor brother  Recollets for the use of our convent? Tell me that, pray! All the salts  and senna in Quebec have not sufficed to restore the digestion of my  poor monks since you played that trick upon them down in your misnamed  village of Beauport!\"    \"Pardon, Reverend Father de Berey!\" replied a smiling habitan, \"it was  not we, but the sacrilegious canaille of St. Anne who boiled the Easter  eggs! If you don't believe us, send some of the good Gray Friars down  to try our love. See if they do not find everything soft for them at  Beauport, from our hearts to our feather beds, to say nothing of our  eggs and bacon. Our good wives are fairly melting with longing for a  sight of the gray gowns of St. Francis once more in our village.\"    \"Oh! I dare be bound the canaille of St. Anne are lost dogs like  yourselves--catuli catulorum.\"    The habitans thought this sounded like a doxology, and some crossed  themselves, amid the dubious laughter of others, who suspected Father de  Berey of a clerical jest.    \"Oh!\" continued he, \"if fat Father Ambrose, the cook of the convent,  only had you, one at a time, to turn the spit for him, in place of the  poor dogs of Quebec, which he has to catch as best he can, and set to  work in his kitchen! but, vagabonds that you are, you are rarely set to  work now on the King's corvee--all work, little play, and no pay!\"    The men took his raillery in excellent part, and one, their spokesman,  bowing low to the Superior, said,--\"Forgive us all the same, good  Father. The hard eggs of Beauport will be soft as lard compared with the  iron shells we are preparing for the English breakfast when they shall  appear some fine morning before Quebec.\"    \"Ah, well, in that case I must pardon the trick you played upon Brothers  Mark and Alexis; and I give you my blessing, too, on condition you send  some salt to our convent to cure our fish, and save your reputations,  which are very stale just now among my good Recollets.\"    A general laugh followed this sally, and the Reverend Superior went off  merrily, as he hastened to catch up with the Governor, who had moved on  to another point in the line of fortifications.    Near the gate of St. John they found a couple of ladies, encouraging  by their presence and kind words a numerous party of habitans,--one an  elderly lady of noble bearing and still beautiful, the rich and powerful  feudal Lady of the Lordship, or Seigniory, of Tilly; the other her  orphan niece, in the bloom of youth, and of surpassing loveliness, the  fair Amelie de Repentigny, who had loyally accompanied her aunt to the  capital with all the men of the Seigniory of Tilly, to assist in the  completion of its defences.    To features which looked as if chiselled out of the purest Parian  marble, just flushed with the glow of morn, and cut in those perfect  lines of proportion which nature only bestows on a few chosen favorites  at intervals to show the possibilities of feminine beauty, Amelie de  Repentigny added a figure which, in its perfect symmetry, looked smaller  than it really was, for she was a tall girl: it filled the eye and held  fast the fancy with the charms of a thousand graces as she moved  or stood, suggestive of the beauty of a tame fawn, that in all its  movements preserves somewhat of the coyness and easy grace of its free  life.    Her hair was very dark and thick, matching her deep liquid eyes, that  lay for the most part so quietly and restfully beneath their long  shading lashes,--eyes gentle, frank, and modest, looking tenderly on  all things innocent, fearlessly on all things harmful; eyes that  nevertheless"]]]
