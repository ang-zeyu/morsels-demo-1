The frontier reached by the  Pacific Railroad, surveyed into rectangles, guarded by the United States  Army, and recruited by the daily immigrant ship, moves forward at a  swifter pace and in a different way than the frontier reached by the  birch canoe or the pack horse. The geologist traces patiently the shores  of ancient seas, maps their areas, and compares the older and the newer.  It would be a work worth the historian's labors to mark these various  frontiers and in detail compare one with another. Not only would there  result a more adequate conception of American development and  characteristics, but invaluable additions would be made to the history  of society.    Loria,[11:1] the Italian economist, has urged the study of colonial life  as an aid in understanding the stages of European development, affirming  that colonial settlement is for economic science what the mountain is  for geology, bringing to light primitive stratifications. \"America,\" he  says, \"has the key to the historical enigma which Europe has sought for  centuries in vain, and the land which has no history reveals luminously  the course of universal history.\" There is much truth in this. The  United States lies like a huge page in the history of society. Line by  line as we read this continental page from West to East we find the  record of social evolution. It begins with the Indian and the hunter; it  goes on to tell of the disintegration of savagery by the entrance of the  trader, the pathfinder of civilization; we read the annals of the  pastoral stage in ranch life; the exploitation of the soil by the  raising of unrotated crops of corn and wheat in sparsely settled farming  communities; the intensive culture of the denser farm settlement; and  finally the manufacturing organization with city and factory  system.[11:2] This page is familiar to the student of census statistics,  but how little of it has been used by our historians. Particularly in  eastern States this page is a palimpsest. What is now a manufacturing  State was in an earlier decade an area of intensive farming. Earlier yet  it had been a wheat area, and still earlier the \"range\" had attracted  the cattle-herder. Thus Wisconsin, now developing manufacture, is a  State with varied agricultural interests. But earlier it was given over  to almost exclusive grain-raising, like North Dakota at the present  time.    Each of these areas has had an influence in our economic and political  history; the evolution of each into a higher stage has worked political  transformations. But what constitutional historian has made any adequate  attempt to interpret political facts by the light of these social areas  and changes?[12:1]    The Atlantic frontier was compounded of fisherman, fur-trader, miner,  cattle-raiser, and farmer. Excepting the fisherman, each type of  industry was on the march toward the West, impelled by an irresistible  attraction. Each passed in successive waves across the continent. Stand  at Cumberland Gap and watch the procession of civilization, marching  single file--the buffalo following the trail to the salt springs, the  Indian, the fur-trader and hunter, the cattle-raiser, the pioneer  farmer--and the frontier has passed by. Stand at South Pass in the  Rockies a century later and see the same procession with wider intervals  between. The unequal rate of advance compels us to distinguish the  frontier into the trader's frontier, the rancher's frontier, or the  miner's frontier, and the farmer's frontier. When the mines and the cow  pens were still near the fall line the traders' pack trains were  tinkling across the Alleghanies, and the French on the Great Lakes were  fortifying their posts, alarmed by the British trader's birch canoe.  When the trappers scaled the Rockies, the farmer was still near the  mouth of the Missouri.    Why was it that the Indian trader passed so rapidly across the  continent? What effects followed from the trader's frontier? The trade  was coeval with American discovery. The Norsemen, Vespuccius, Verrazani,  Hudson, John Smith, all trafficked for furs. The Plymouth pilgrims  settled in Indian cornfields, and their first return cargo was of beaver  and lumber. The records of the various New England colonies show how  steadily exploration was carried into the wilderness by this trade. What  is true for New England is, as would be expected, even plainer for the  rest of the colonies. All along the coast from Maine to Georgia the  Indian trade opened up the river courses. Steadily the trader passed  westward, utilizing the older lines of French trade. The Ohio, the Great  Lakes, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Platte, the lines of  western advance, were ascended by traders. They found the passes in the  Rocky Mountains and guided Lewis and Clark,[13:1] Fremont, and Bidwell.  The explanation of the rapidity of this advance is connected with the  effects of the trader on the Indian. The trading post left the unarmed  tribes at the mercy of those that had purchased fire-arms--a truth which  the Iroquois Indians wrote in blood, and so the remote and unvisited  tribes gave eager welcome to the trader. \"The savages,\" wrote La Salle,  \"take better care of us French than of their own children; from us only  can they get guns and goods.\" This accounts for the trader's power and  the rapidity of his advance. Thus the disintegrating forces of  civilization entered the wilderness. Every river valley and Indian trail  became a fissure in Indian society, and so that society became  honeycombed. Long before the pioneer farmer appeared on the scene,  primitive Indian life had passed away. The farmers met Indians armed  with guns. The trading frontier, while steadily undermining Indian power  by making the tribes ultimately dependent on the whites, yet, through  its sale of guns, gave to the Indian increased power of resistance to  the farming frontier. French colonization was dominated by its trading  frontier; English colonization by its farming frontier. There was an  antagonism between the two frontiers as between the two nations. Said  Duquesne to the Iroquois, \"Are you ignorant of the difference between  the king of England and the king of France? Go see the forts that our  king has established and you will see that you can still hunt under  their very walls. They have been placed for your advantage in places  which you frequent. The English, on the contrary, are no sooner in  possession of a place than the game is driven away. The forest falls  before them as they advance, and the soil is laid bare so that you can  scarce find the wherewithal to erect a shelter for the night.\"    And yet, in spite of this opposition of the interests of the trader and  the farmer, the Indian trade pioneered the way for civilization. The  buffalo trail became the Indian trail, and this became the trader's  \"trace;\" the trails widened into roads, and the roads into turnpikes,  and these in turn were transformed into railroads. The same origin can  be shown for the railroads of the South, the Far West, and the Dominion  of Canada.[14:1] The trading posts reached by these trails were on the  sites of Indian villages which had been placed in positions suggested by  nature; and these trading posts, situated so as to command the water  systems of the country, have grown into such cities as Albany,  Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Council Bluffs, and Kansas  City. Thus civilization in America has followed the arteries made by  geology, pouring an ever richer tide through them, until at last the  slender paths of aboriginal intercourse have been broadened and  interwoven into the complex mazes of modern commercial lines; the  wilderness has been interpenetrated by lines of civilization growing  ever more numerous. It is like the steady growth of a complex nervous  system for the originally simple, inert continent. If one would  understand why we are to-day one nation, rather than a collection of  isolated states, he must study this economic and social consolidation of  the country. In this progress from savage conditions lie topics for the  evolutionist.[15:1]    The effect of the Indian frontier as a consolidating agent in our  history is important. From the close of the seventeenth century various  intercolonial congresses have been called to treat with Indians and  establish common measures of defense. Particularism was strongest in  colonies with no Indian frontier. This frontier stretched along the  western border like a cord of union. The Indian was a common danger,  demanding united action. Most celebrated of these conferences was the  Albany congress of 1754, called to treat with the Six Nations, and to  consider plans of union. Even a cursory reading of the plan proposed by  the congress reveals the importance of the frontier. The powers of the  general council and the officers were, chiefly, the determination of  peace and war with the Indians, the regulation of Indian trade, the  purchase of Indian lands, and the creation and government of new  settlements as a security against the Indians. It is evident that the  unifying tendencies of the Revolutionary period were facilitated by the  previous cooperation in the regulation of the frontier. In this  connection may be mentioned the importance of the frontier, from that  day to this, as a military training school, keeping alive the power of  resistance to aggression, and developing the stalwart and rugged  qualities of the frontiersman.    It would not be possible in the limits of this paper to trace the other  frontiers across the continent. Travelers of the eighteenth century  found the \"cowpens\" among the canebrakes and peavine pastures of the  South, and the \"cow drivers\" took their droves to Charleston,  Philadelphia, and New York.[16:1] Travelers at the close of the War of  1812 met droves of more than a thousand cattle and swine from the  interior of Ohio"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/230"],[0,"The Bucolics and Eclogues (#3)"],[1,"Do you first begin,  Good Mopsus, whether minded to sing aught  Of Phyllis and her loves, or Alcon's praise,  Or to fling taunts at Codrus. Come, begin,  While Tityrus watches o'er the grazing kids.    MOPSUS  Nay, then, I will essay what late I carved  On a green beech-tree's rind, playing by turns,  And marking down the notes; then afterward  Bid you Amyntas match them if he can.    MENALCAS  As limber willow to pale olive yields,  As lowly Celtic nard to rose-buds bright,  So, to my mind, Amyntas yields to you.  But hold awhile, for to the cave we come.    MOPSUS  \"For Daphnis cruelly slain wept all the Nymphs-  Ye hazels, bear them witness, and ye streams-  When she, his mother, clasping in her arms  The hapless body of the son she bare,  To gods and stars unpitying, poured her plaint.  Then, Daphnis, to the cooling streams were none  That drove the pastured oxen, then no beast  Drank of the river, or would the grass-blade touch.  Nay, the wild rocks and woods then voiced the roar  Of Afric lions mourning for thy death.  Daphnis, 'twas thou bad'st yoke to Bacchus' car  Armenian tigresses, lead on the pomp  Of revellers, and with tender foliage wreathe  The bending spear-wands. As to trees the vine  Is crown of glory, as to vines the grape,  Bulls to the herd, to fruitful fields the corn,  So the one glory of thine own art thou.  When the Fates took thee hence, then Pales' self,  And even Apollo, left the country lone.  Where the plump barley-grain so oft we sowed,  There but wild oats and barren darnel spring;  For tender violet and narcissus bright  Thistle and prickly thorn uprear their heads.  Now, O ye shepherds, strew the ground with leaves,  And o'er the fountains draw a shady veil-  So Daphnis to his memory bids be done-  And rear a tomb, and write thereon this verse:  'I, Daphnis in the woods, from hence in fame  Am to the stars exalted, guardian once  Of a fair flock, myself more fair than they.'\"    MENALCAS  So is thy song to me, poet divine,  As slumber on the grass to weary limbs,  Or to slake thirst from some sweet-bubbling rill  In summer's heat. Nor on the reeds alone,  But with thy voice art thou, thrice happy boy,  Ranked with thy master, second but to him.  Yet will I, too, in turn, as best I may,  Sing thee a song, and to the stars uplift  Thy Daphnis- Daphnis to the stars extol,  For me too Daphnis loved.    MOPSUS                                Than such a boon  What dearer could I deem? the boy himself  Was worthy to be sung, and many a time  Hath Stimichon to me your singing praised.    MENALCAS  \"In dazzling sheen with unaccustomed eyes  Daphnis stands rapt before Olympus' gate,  And sees beneath his feet the clouds and stars.  Wherefore the woods and fields, Pan, shepherd-folk,  And Dryad-maidens, thrill with eager joy;  Nor wolf with treacherous wile assails the flock,  Nor nets the stag: kind Daphnis loveth peace.  The unshorn mountains to the stars up-toss  Voices of gladness; ay, the very rocks,  The very thickets, shout and sing, 'A god,  A god is he, Menalcas \"Be thou kind,  Propitious to thine own. Lo! altars four,  Twain to thee, Daphnis, and to Phoebus twain  For sacrifice, we build; and I for thee  Two beakers yearly of fresh milk afoam,  And of rich olive-oil two bowls, will set;  And of the wine-god's bounty above all,  If cold, before the hearth, or in the shade  At harvest-time, to glad the festal hour,  From flasks of Ariusian grape will pour  Sweet nectar. Therewithal at my behest  Shall Lyctian Aegon and Damoetas sing,  And Alphesiboeus emulate in dance  The dancing Satyrs. This, thy service due,  Shalt thou lack never, both when we pay the Nymphs  Our yearly vows, and when with lustral rites  The fields we hallow. Long as the wild boar  Shall love the mountain-heights, and fish the streams,  While bees on thyme and crickets feed on dew,  Thy name, thy praise, thine honour, shall endure.  Even as to Bacchus and to Ceres, so  To thee the swain his yearly vows shall make;  And thou thereof, like them, shalt quittance claim.\"    MOPSUS  How, how repay thee for a song so rare?  For not the whispering south-wind on its way  So much delights me, nor wave-smitten beach,  Nor streams that race adown their bouldered beds.    MENALCAS  First this frail hemlock-stalk to you I give,  Which taught me \"Corydon with love was fired  For fair Alexis,\" ay, and this beside,  \"Who owns the flock?- Meliboeus?\"    MOPSUS                                      But take you  This shepherd's crook, which, howso hard he begged,  Antigenes, then worthy to be loved,  Prevailed not to obtain- with brass, you see,  And equal knots, Menalcas, fashioned fair!          ECLOGUE VI    TO VARUS    First my Thalia stooped in sportive mood  To Syracusan strains, nor blushed within  The woods to house her. When I sought to tell  Of battles and of kings, the Cynthian god  Plucked at mine ear and warned me: \"Tityrus,  Beseems a shepherd-wight to feed fat sheep,  But sing a slender song.\" Now, Varus, I-  For lack there will not who would laud thy deeds,  And treat of dolorous wars- will rather tune  To the slim oaten reed my silvan lay.  I sing but as vouchsafed me; yet even this  If, if but one with ravished eyes should read,  Of thee, O Varus, shall our tamarisks  And all the woodland ring; nor can there be  A page more dear to Phoebus, than the page  Where, foremost writ, the name of Varus stands.    Speed ye, Pierian Maids! Within a cave  Young Chromis and Mnasyllos chanced to see  Silenus sleeping, flushed, as was his wont,  With wine of yesterday. Not far aloof,  Slipped from his head, the garlands lay, and there  By its worn handle hung a ponderous cup.  Approaching- for the old man many a time  Had balked them both of a long hoped-for song-  Garlands to fetters turned, they bind him fast.  Then Aegle, fairest of the Naiad-band,  Aegle came up to the half-frightened boys,  Came, and, as now with open eyes he lay,  With juice of blood-red mulberries smeared him o'er,  Both brow and temples. Laughing at their guile,  And crying, \"Why tie the fetters? loose me, boys;  Enough for you to think you had the power;  Now list the songs you wish for- songs for you,  Another meed for her\" -forthwith began.  Then might you see the wild things of the wood,  With Fauns in sportive frolic beat the time,  And stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow.  Not Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag  So ravish, nor Orpheus so entrance the heights  Of Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang  How through the mighty void the seeds were driven  Of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire,  How all that is from these beginnings grew,  And the young world itself took solid shape,  Then 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep  Shut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things  Little by little; and how the earth amazed  Beheld the new sun shining, and the showers  Fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods  'Gan first to rise, and living things to roam  Scattered among the hills that knew them not.  Then sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast,  Of Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft,  And the Caucasian birds, and told withal  Nigh to what fountain by his comrades left  The mariners cried on Hylas till the shore  \"Then Re-echoed \"Hylas, Hylas! soothed  Pasiphae with the love of her white bull-  Happy if cattle-kind had never been!-  O ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul  The daughters too of Proetus filled the fields  With their feigned lowings, yet no one of them  Of such unhallowed union e'er was fain  As with a beast to mate, though many a time  On her smooth forehead she had sought for horns,  And for her neck had feared the galling plough.  O ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills,  While on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side  Reposing, under some dark ilex now  Chews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks  Amid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs,  Ye Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades,  If haply there may chance upon mine eyes  The white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike  Following the herd, or by green pasture lured,  Some kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls.  Then sings he of the maid so wonder-struck  With the apples of the Hesperids, and then  With moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms  Of Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground  Up-towering into poplars. Next he sings  Of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream,  And by a sister of the Muses led  To the Aonian mountains, and how all  The choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how  The shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine,  Brow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake:  \"These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou,  Erst to the aged bard of Ascra given,  Wherewith in singing he was wont to draw  Time-rooted ash-trees from the mountain heights.  With these the birth of the Grynean grove  Be voiced by thee, that of no grove beside  Apollo more may boast him.\" Wherefore speak  Of Scylla, child of Nisus, who, 'tis said,  Her fair white loins with barking monsters girt  Vexed the Dulichian ships, and, in the deep  Swift-eddying whirlpool, with her sea-dogs tore  The trembling mariners? or how he told  Of the changed limbs of Tereus- what a feast,  What gifts, to him by Philomel were given;  How swift she sought the desert, with what wings  Hovered in anguish o'er her ancient home?  All that, of old, Eurotas, happy stream,  Heard, as Apollo mused upon the lyre,  And bade his laurels learn, Silenus sang;  Till from Olympus, loth at his approach,  Vesper, advancing, bade the shepherds tell  Their tale of sheep, and pen them in the fold.          ECLOGUE VII    MELIBOEUS   CORYDON   THYRSIS    Daphnis beneath a rustling ilex-tree  Had sat him down; Thyrsis and Corydon  Had gathered in the flock, Thyrsis the sheep,  And Corydon the she-goats swollen with milk-  Both in the flower of age, Arcadians both,  Ready to sing, and in like strain reply.
