APRIL 1, 1851. No. I          JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.    [Illustration]      The readers of the _International_ have in the above engraving, from a  Daguerreotype by Brady, the best portrait ever published of an  illustrious countryman of ours, who, as a novelist, take him all in all,  is entitled to precedence of every other now living. \"With what amazing  power,\" exclaims Balzac, in the _Revue de Paris_, \"has he painted  nature! how all his pages glow with creative fire! Who is there writing  English among our contemporaries, if not of him, of whom it can be said  that he has a genius of the first order?\" And the _Edinburgh Review_  says, \"The empire of the sea, has been conceded to him by acclamation;\"  that, \"in the lonely desert or untrodden prairie, among the savage  Indians or scarcely less savage settlers, all equally acknowledge his  dominion. 'Within this circle none dares walk but he.'\" And Christopher  North, in the _Noctes_: \"He writes like a hero!\" And beyond the limits  of his own country, every where, the great critics assign him a place  among the foremost of the illustrious authors of the age. In each of the  departments of romantic, fiction in which he has written, he has had  troops of imitators, and in not one of them an equal. Writing not from  books, but from nature, his descriptions, incidents, and characters, are  as fresh as the fields of his triumphs. His Harvey Birch, Leather  Stocking, Long Tom Coffin, and other heroes, rise before the mind, each  in his clearly defined and peculiar lineaments, as striking original  _creations_, as actual persons. His infinitely varied descriptions of  the ocean, ships gliding like beings of the air upon its surface, vast  solitary wildernesses, and indeed all his delineations of nature, are  instinct with the breath of poetry; he is both the Horace Vernet and the  Claude Lorraine of novelists; and through all his works are sentiments  of genuine courtesy and honor, and an unobtrusive and therefore more  powerful assertion of natural rights and dignity.    WILLIAM COOPER, the emigrant ancestor of JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, arrived  in this country in 1679, and settled at Burlington, New Jersey. He  immediately took an active part in public affairs, and his name appears  in the list of members of the Colonial Legislature for 1681. In 1687, or  subsequent to the establishment of Penn at Philadelphia, he obtained a  grant of land opposite the new city, extending several miles along the  margin of the Delaware and the tributary stream which has since borne  the name of Cooper's Creek. The branch of the family to which the  novelist belongs removed more than a century since into Pennsylvania, in  which state his father was born. He married early, and while a young man  established himself at a hamlet in Burlington county, New Jersey, which  continues to be known by his name, and afterward in the city of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#3)"],[1,"natural diffidence has held the hands of the great majority.  For sins of omission and commission I beg the forgiveness of those with  whom I had the great honour of serving and for whom, as comrades, men,  and soldiers, I have the greatest respect and admiration.    The sources of information upon which I have had to mainly depend have  been:--A very imperfect Official War Diary; my own letters; my memory;  and a few contributions from former comrades. These last have been  received from Major E. G. Glyde, Captains A. M. P. Montgomery, A. S.  Isaac, N. W. Sundercombe, G. D. Shaw, T. O. Nicholls, and C. C. Flower.  But more particularly am I indebted to Lieut. J. T. Blair, who placed at  my disposal a considerable quantity of material which he had been at  great pains to collect whilst in London.    As regards photographs and maps: Valuable prints and drafts have been  supplied by the Trustees of the Australian War Museum. Mr. C. E. W.  Bean, the Australian War Correspondent and Official Historian, has very  kindly lent me photographs from his private collection. Mr. E. L.  Mitchell and Mr. W. Owen, both of Perth, have generously given  unrestricted permission to reproduce from their negatives, and certain  members, and relatives of members, have also contributed interesting  specimens. For the map of the Australian Corps' Front on Gallipoli, and  the plans and diagrams referring to Cairo, Tel-el-Kebir, and the  Pyramid, I have especially to thank Captain E. A. E. Andrewartha of the  Australian Staff Corps.    The publication of the Nominal Rolls of Members of the Battalion has  been made possible largely through the assistance of Major J. M. Lean,  M.B.E., the Officer in Charge of Base Records, Melbourne.    For historical data, descriptive matter, and a few other essentials, I  have also consulted the following works:--Barrett and Deane (\"The  A.A.M.C. in Egypt\"); Callwell (\"The Dardanelles Campaign and its  Lessons\"); Ellis (\"Story of the 5th Division\"); Hamilton (\"Gallipoli  Diary\"); Masefield (\"Gallipoli\"); \"Military History of the Campaign of  1882 in Egypt\" (official); Nevinson (\"The Dardanelles Campaign\");  Schuler (\"Australia in Arms\"); Sladen (\"Oriental Cairo\"); Woods (\"Washed  by Four Seas\"), and several others the names of which I cannot now  recall. I am also under a great obligation to J. S. Battye, Litt.D.,  B.A., LL.B., the General Secretary of the Public Library, whose  invaluable advice has guided me through a pleasing but arduous task.
