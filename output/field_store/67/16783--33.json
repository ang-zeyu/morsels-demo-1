Are you sure you're not a professional?\"    \"Quite sure,\" answered Kit, smiling.    \"You never traveled with a show, then?\"    Kit shook his head.    \"Where on earth did you pick up all these acts?\"    \"I took lessons of Professor Donaldson.\"    \"You did! Well, that explains it. I say, kid, you ought to join a  circus. You'd command a fine salary.\"    \"Would I? How much could I get?\" asked Kit, with interest.    \"Ten or twelve dollars a week and all expenses paid. That's pretty good  pay for a kid, isn't it?\"    \"It's more than I ever earned yet,\" answered Kit, with a smile.    \"I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Barlow would give you that now. If you ever  make up your mind to join a show, come round and see him.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Kit.    Soon after the boys left the circus lot and went home.    \"Would you really join a circus, Kit?\" asked Dan.    \"It isn't the life I would choose,\" answered Kit, seriously, \"but I may  have to find some way of earning a living, and that very soon.\"    \"I thought your father left you a fortune.\"    \"So did I; but I hear that I am to be taken from boarding school, and  possibly set to work. Ralph has given me a hint of it. I shall soon  know, as my uncle intimates that he has a communication to make me.\"    \"I hope it isn't as bad as you think, Kit.\"    \"I hope so too, but I can tell you better to-morrow. We will meet  to-night at the show.\"          CHAPTER IV.    A SCENE NOT DOWN ON THE BILLS.      Just before supper Kit was asked to an interview with his uncle.    \"You wish to speak to me, Uncle Stephen?\" he said.    \"Yes; I have decided not to postpone the explanation for which you asked  yesterday.\"    \"I shall be glad to hear it, sir.\"    \"Ever since your father's death I have supported you, not because I was  morally or legally bound to do so, but because you were my nephew.\"    \"But didn't my father leave any property?\" asked Kit in amazement.    \"He was supposed to have done so.\"    \"This house and grounds are surely worth a good deal of money!\"    \"So they are,\" answered Stephen Watson, dryly, \"but unfortunately they  did not belong to your father.\"    \"This is certainly a mistake,\" exclaimed Kit, indignantly.    \"Wait till I have finished. These stood in your father's name, but there  was a mortgage of two thousand dollars held by the Smyrna Savings Bank.\"    \"Surely the place is worth far more than two thousand dollars!\"    \"Curb your impatience, and you will soon understand me. The place _is_  worth far more than two thousand dollars. I consider it worth ten  thousand.\"    \"Then I don't see----\"    \"Your father left large debts, which of course had to be paid. I was  therefore obliged to sell the estate, in order to realize the necessary  funds.\"    \"For how much did you sell the place?\"    \"For nine thousand dollars. I regarded that as a good price, considering  that it was paid in cash or the equivalent.\"    \"To whom did you sell?\"    \"I bought it in myself; I was not willing that the place which my  brother had loved so well, should pass into the hands of strangers.\"    \"May I ask who was my father's principal creditor?\" asked Kit.    \"Ahem! I was,\" answered Stephen Watson, in a tone of slight  embarrassment.    \"You!\" exclaimed Kit, in fresh surprise.    \"Yes; your father owed me twelve thousand dollars borrowed at various  times.\"    \"How could he have been obliged to borrow so much?\" asked Kit. \"He  always seemed comfortably situated. I never once heard him complain of  being pressed for money.\"    \"Very likely; he was very reticent about his affairs. I would explain,  but the matter is rather a delicate one.\"    \"I think I am entitled to know all about it, Uncle Stephen,\" said Kit,  firmly.    \"Be it so! Perhaps you are right. Let me tell you in the briefest terms,  then, that in his later years your father speculated in Wall Street--not  heavily, for he had not the means, but heavily for one of his property.  Of course he lost. Almost every one does, who ventures into the  'street.' His first losses, instead of deterring him from further  speculation, led him on to rasher ventures. It was then that he came to  me for money.\"    \"Didn't you urge him to give up speculating?\" asked Kit.    \"Yes, but my words availed little. Perhaps you will think I ought to  have refused him loans, but he assured me in the strongest terms that  unless he obtained money from some source he would be ruined, and I  yielded. I might have been weak--it was weak, for I stood a chance of  losing all, having merely his notes of hand to show for the money I  lent. But it is hard to refuse a brother. I think I should do the same  again.\"    Kit was silent. His uncle's words were warm, and indicated strong  sympathy for Kit's father, but his tone was cold, and there seemed a  lack of earnestness. Kit could not repress a feeling of incredulity.  There was another obstacle to his accepting with full credence the tale  which his uncle told him. He had always understood from his father that  his uncle was a poor and struggling man. How could he have in his  possession the sum of twelve thousand dollars to lend his brother? This  question was certainly difficult to answer. He paused, then refraining  from discussing the subject, said:    \"Why have you not told me this before, Uncle Stephen?\"    \"Would it have made you any happier?\" returned Stephen Watson.    \"No.\"    \"Till you had acquired a fair education, I thought it better to keep the  unpleasant truth from you. It would only have annoyed you to feel that  you owed everything to my generosity, and were in fact a child of  charity.\"    Kit's face flushed deeply as he heard this expression from his uncle's  lips.    \"Do you mean that my father left absolutely nothing?\" he asked.    \"Yes, absolutely nothing. Well, no, not quite that. I think there was a  balance of a little over a hundred dollars left after paying all debts.  That is hardly worth counting.\"    \"Yes, that is hardly worth counting,\" said Kit in a dull, mechanical  tone.    \"Still, I determined to educate you, and give you equal advantages with  my own son. I have done so up to the present moment. I wish I could  continue to do so, but Ralph is getting more expensive as he grows older  (and you also), and I cannot afford to keep you both at school. You will  therefore stop studying, and I shall secure you some work.\"    \"If things are as you say, I cannot complain of this,\" Kit said in a  dull, spiritless tone, \"but it comes upon me like a thunderbolt.\"    \"No doubt, no doubt. I knew it would be a shock, and I have postponed  telling you as long as possible.\"    \"I suppose I ought to thank you. Have you anything more to say to me  now?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then, sir, I will leave you. I will ask further particulars some other  day.\"    \"He takes it hard,\" muttered Stephen Watson, eyeing the retreating form  of his nephew thoughtfully. \"I wonder if he will suspect that there is  anything wrong. Even if he does, he is only a boy, and can prove  nothing.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"What makes you so glum, Kit?\" asked Dan Clark, when they met at seven  o'clock, as agreed, to go together to the show.    \"Not much, Dan, only I have learned that I am a pauper.\"    \"But the estate--the house and the grounds?\" said Dan, bewildered.    \"Belong to my uncle.\"    \"Who says so?\"    \"He says so. But I don't want to say any more about it now. Let us start  for the circus, and I will try to forget my pauper position, for one  evening at least.\"    Before they reached the lot, they heard the circus band discoursing  lively music. They were in a crowd, for all Smyrna, men, women and  children, were bound for the show. It was a grand gala night. In the  city, where there are many amusements, the circus draws well, but in the  country everybody goes.    Outside the great tent were the side shows. In one of them Kit found his  friends of the morning, the giant, the dwarf, and the fat lady, with  other curiosities hereafter to be mentioned. Just inside the tent, in  what might be called the ante chamber, was the collection of animals.  The elephants were accorded more freedom than the rest, but the lion,  tiger, and leopard were shut up in cages. The lion seemed particularly  restless. He was pacing his narrow quarters, lashing his tail, and from  time to time emitting deep growls, betokening irritation and anger.    \"How would you like to go into the cage?\" asked Dan.    \"I don't care for an interview with his majesty,\" responded Kit.    A stranger was standing near the cage.    \"Don't go too near, boys!\" he said. \"That lion is particularly fierce.  He nearly killed a man last season in Pennsylvania.\"    \"How was that?\"    \"The man ventured too near the cage. The lion stretched out his claws,  and fastened them in the man's shoulder, lacerating it fearfully before  he could be released. He came near dying of blood poisoning.\"    Kit and Dan sheered off. The lion looked wicked enough to kill a dozen  men.    At eight o'clock the performance commenced. First there was a procession  of elephants and horses, the latter carrying the bareback riders and  other members of the circus, with the curiosities and freaks. Then came  two bareback riders, who jumped through hoops, and over banners, and  performed somersaults, to the wondering delight of the boys. Then came  tumblers, and in preparation for another scene a gaudily dressed clown  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#3)"],[1,"    \"Do look, my dear, how funny it is. He shuts himself up to write this.  He paces up and down, talking to himself. As for me, I understand  nothing of what he does.\"    And then came endless regrets, and recollections of her past life.    \"Ah! if I had known. When I think that I might have married Aubertot and  Fajon, the linen-drapers.\" She always spoke of the two partners at the  same time, as though she would have married the firm. Neither did she  restrain her feelings in her husband's presence.    [Illustration: p031-042]    She disturbed him, prevented all work, settling down with her friends in  the very room he was writing in, and filling it with the silly  chatter of idle women, who talked loud, full of disdain for a literary  profession which brought in so little, and whose most laborious hours  always resemble a capricious idleness. From time to time Heurtebise  strove to escape from the life which he felt was daily becoming more  dismal. He rushed off to Paris, hired a small room at an hotel, tried to  fancy he was a bachelor; but suddenly he thought of his son, and with a  desperate longing to embrace him hurried back the same evening into the  country.    [Illustration: p032-043]    On these occasions, in order to avoid the inevitable scene on his  return, he took a friend back with him and kept him there as long as he  could. As soon as he was no longer alone face to face with his wife,  his fine intellect awoke and his interrupted schemes of work little by  little and one after the other came back to him. But what anguish it was  when his friends left! He would have kept his guests for ever, clinging  to them by all the strength of his _ennui_. With what sadness would he  accompany us to the stand of the little suburban omnibus which bore us  back to Paris! and when we left, how slowly he turned homewards over the  dusty road, with rounded shoulders and listless arms, listening to the  vanishing wheels.    In truth their _tete-a-tete_ life had become unbearable, and to avoid  it, he tried always to keep his house full. With his easy goodnature,  his weariness and indifference, he was soon surrounded by a lot of  literary starvelings. A set of scribblers, lazy, cracked day-dreamers,  settled down upon him and became more at home than himself; and as his  wife was but a fool, incapable of judging, because they talked more  loudly, she found them charming and very superior to her husband. The  days were spent in idle discussions. There was a clash of empty words,  a firing of smallest shot, and poor Heurtebise, motionless and silent  in the midst of the tumult, merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders.  Sometimes, however, towards the end of an interminable repast, when all  his guests, elbows on table, began around the brandy flasks one of  those lengthy maundering conversations, benumbing like clouds of tobacco  smoke, an immense feeling of disgust would seize hold of him, and not  having the courage to turn out all these poor wretches, he would himself  disappear and remain absent for a week.    [Illustration: p034-045]    \"My house is full of imbeciles,\" he said one day to me. \"I dare not  return.\" With this kind of existence, he no longer wrote. His name was  never seen, and his fortune, squandered in a perpetual craving to have  people in his house, disappeared in the outstretched hands around him.    [Illustration: p035-046]    It was a long time since we had met when I received one morning a line  of his dear little handwriting, formerly so firm, now trembling and  uncertain. \"We are in Paris. Come and see me. I am so dull.\" I found him  with his wife, his child and his dogs, in a lugubrious little apartment  in the Batignolles. The disorder which in this narrow space could not be  spread about, seemed more hideous even than in the country. While the  child and dogs rolled about in rooms the size of a chessboard  compartment, Heurtebise; who was ill, lay with his face to the wall, in  a state of utter prostration. His wife, dressed out as usual, and ever  placid, hardly looked at him. \"I don't know what is the matter with  him,\" she said to me with a gesture of indifference. On seeing me he had  for a moment a return of gaiety, and a minute of his old hearty laugh,  but it was soon stifled. As they had kept up in Paris all their suburban  habits, there appeared at the breakfast hour, in the midst of this  household disorganized by poverty and illness, a parasite, a seedy  looking little bald man, cranky and peevish, of whom they always spoke  as \"the man who has read Proudhon.\" It was thus that Heurtebise, who  probably had never known his name, introduced him to everybody. When he  was asked \"Who is that?\" he unhesitatingly replied, \"Oh! a very clever  fellow, who has thoroughly studied Proudhon.\" His knowledge was  certainly not very apparent, for this deep thinker rarely made himself  heard except to complain at table of an ill-cooked roast or a spoilt  sauce. On this occasion, the man who had read Proudhon declared that the  breakfast was detestable, which however did not prevent his devouring  the larger half of it himself.    How long and lugubrious this meal by the bedside of my sick friend  appeared to me! The wife gossiped as usual, with a tap now and then to  the child, a bone to the dogs, and a smile to the philosopher. Not once  did Heurtebise turn towards us, and yet he was not asleep. I hardly know  whether he thought. Dear, valiant fellow! In those paltry and ceaseless  struggles, the mainspring of his strong nature had broken, and he was  already beginning to die. The silent death agony, which however was  rather an abandonment of life, lasted several months; and then Madame  Heurtebise found herself a widow. Then, as no tears had dimmed her clear  eyes, as she always bestowed the same care on her glossy locks, and as  Aubertot and Fajon were still available, she married Aubertot and Fajon.  Perhaps it was Aubertot, perhaps it was Fajon, perhaps even both of  them. In any case, she was able to resume the life she was fitted for,  and the voluble gossip and eternal smile of the shopwoman.    [Illustration: p038-049]    [Illustration: p041-052]          THE CREDO OF LOVE.    To be the wife of a poet! that had been the dream of her life! but  ruthless fate, instead of the romantic and fevered existence she sighed  for, had doomed her to a peaceful, humdrum happiness, and married her to  a rich man at Auteuil, gentle and amiable, perhaps indeed a trifle  old for her, possessed of but one passion,--perfectly inoffensive and  unexciting--that of horticulture. This excellent man spent his days  pruning, scissors in hand, tending and trimming a magnificent collection  of rose trees, heating a greenhouse, watering flower beds; and really it  must be admitted that, for a poor little heart hungering after an ideal,  this was hardly sufficient food. Nevertheless for ten years her life  remained straightforward and uniform, like the smooth sanded paths in  her husband's garden, and she pursued it with measured steps, listening  with resigned weariness to the dry and irritating sound of the  ever-moving scissors, or to the monotonous and endless showers that fell  from the watering pots on to the leafy shrubs. The rabid horticulturist  bestowed on his wife the same scrupulous attention he gave to his  flowers. He carefully regulated the temperature of the drawing-room,  overcrowded with nosegays, fearing for her the April frosts or March  sun; and like the plants in pots that are put out and taken in at stated  times, he made her live methodically, ever watchful of a change of  barometer or phase of the moon.    She remained like this for a long time, closed in by the four walls  of the conjugal garden, innocent as a clematis, full however of wild  aspirations towards other gardens, less staid, less humdrum, where the  rose trees would fling out their branches untrained, and the wild growth  of weed and briar be taller than the trees, and blossom with unknown and  fantastic flowers, luxuriantly coloured by a warmer sun. Such gardens  are rarely found save in the books of poets, and so she read many  verses, all unknown to the nurseryman, who knew no other poetry than a  few almanac distichs such as:         Quand il pleut a la Saint-Medard,       Il pleut quarante jours plus tard.*         * When it rains on Saint Medard's day,       It rains on for forty more days.    At haphazard, the unfortunate creature ravenously devoured the paltriest  rhymes, satisfied if she found in them lines ending in \"love\" and  \"passion\"; then closing the book, she would spend hours dreaming and  sighing: \"That would have been the husband for me!\"    It is probable that all this would have remained in a state of vague  aspiration, if at the terrible age of thirty, which seems to be the  decisive critical moment for woman's virtue, as twelve o'clock is for  the day's beauty, the irresistible Amaury had not chanced to cross her  path. Amaury was a drawing-room poet, one of those fanatics in dress  coat and grey kid gloves, who between ten o'clock and midnight, go  and recite to the world their ecstasies of love, their raptures, their  despair, leaning mournfully against the mantel-piece, in the blaze of  the lights, while seated around him women, in full evening dress, listen  entranced behind their fans.    This one might pose as the very ideal of his kind; with his vulgar but  irresistible countenance, sunken eye, pallid complexion, hair cut short  and moustaches stiffly plastered with cosmetic. A desperate man such  as women love, hopeless of life but irreproachably dressed, a lyric  enthusiast, chilled and disheartened, in whom the madness of inspiration  can be divined only in the loose and neglected tie of his cravat. But  also what success awaits him, when he delivers in a strident voice  a tirade from his poem, the _Credo of Love_, more especially the one  ending in this extraordinary line:        "]]]
