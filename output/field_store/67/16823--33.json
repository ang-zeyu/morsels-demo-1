[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#3)"],[1,"of, consideration of Dr.  Royce's review of the Shirley Letters will be resumed.    The Doctor, on page 350 of his work, says, \"In her little library she  had a Bible, a prayer-book, Shakespeare, and Lowell's 'Fable for the  Critics,' with two or three other books.\" Shirley (p. 100, post) says  she had a--        Bible and prayer-book, Shakespeare, Spenser, Coleridge, Shelley,      Keats, Lowell's Fable for Critics, Walton's Complete Angler, and      some Spanish books.    The poet Spenser's name was spelled with a _c_ in the Pioneer, but the  article \"the\" was not used before \"Critics,\" as in the extract from  Royce,--an unpardonable error in a book printed in Cambridge, and at  the Riverside Press too.    The Spanish books mentioned by Shirley were evidently not neglected by  her, and her acquaintance with and friendship for the Spanish-speaking  population scattered along the banks of the Rio de las Plumas must have  made her very familiar with their tongue. In reading these Letters one  cannot fail to perceive how fittingly Spanish words and phrases are  interwoven with her own English. At the time these Letters were  written, many Spanish words were a part of the California vernacular,  but to Shirley belongs the honor of introducing them into the  literature of California; hence, in printing the Letters, such words  are not italicized, as they usually are, by printers who should know  better.    Dr. Royce also says on page 350, \"Prominent in the society of the Bar  was a trapper, of the old Fremont party, who told blood-curdling tales  of Indian fights.\" (See post, p. 111.) It is singular that the Doctor  has failed to identify this trapper with the well-known James P.  Beckwourth, whose Life and Adventures (Harpers, New York, 1856) was  written from his own dictation by Thomas D. Bonner, a justice of the  peace in Butte County in 1852. His name is preserved in \"Beckwourth  Pass.\" He first entered this pass probably in the spring of the year  1851, although 1850 is the year given in his Life. The Western Pacific  Railroad utilizes the pass for its tracks entering California, and  through it came the pioneers of whom Shirley has much to say in Letter  the Twenty-second.    Among punishments for thefts, the Doctor, on page 351, speaks of a  \"decidedly barbarous case of hanging\" for that offense. It is referred  to here for the reason that in the sequel of the hanging Bret Harte  found more than a suggestion for his finale of The Outcasts of Poker  Flat. Both are reprinted here for the purpose of comparison. Shirley  says (post, p. 157),--        The body of the criminal was allowed to hang for some hours after      the execution. It had commenced storming in the earlier part of the      evening, and when those whose business it was to inter the remains      arrived at the spot, they found them enwrapped in a soft white      shroud of feathery snowflakes, as if pitying nature had tried to      hide from the offended face of Heaven the cruel deed which her      mountain-children had committed.    The finale of The Outcasts of Poker Flat follows, in part, with no  other changes than those of punctuation and capitalization.        They slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when      voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. And when      pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could      scarcely have told, from the equal peace that dwelt upon them,      which was she that had sinned. Even the law of Poker Flat      recognized this, and turned away, leaving them still locked in each      other's arms. But at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest      pine-trees, they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a      bowie-knife.... And pulseless and cold, with a derringer by his      side and a bullet in his heart, though still calm as in life,      beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the      weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat.    The phrase, \"though still calm as in life,\" in the last sentence of the  extract immediately preceding, is one that would seem to invite the  challenge of a proof-reader. It is passed without further notice.    Dr. Royce is not at his best in reviewing Letter the Nineteenth. The  suggestion for The Outcasts of Poker Flat was found therein by Bret  Harte, as previously noted. On page 354 the Doctor says,--        A \"majestic-looking Spaniard\" had quarreled with an Irishman about      a Mexican girl (\"Shirley\" for the first time, I think, thus showing      a knowledge of the presence at Indian Bar of those women who seem,      in the bright and orderly days of her first arrival, to have been      actually unknown in the camp). The Mexican, having at last stabbed      and killed the other, fled to the hills.    It does not appear from the letter that a girl of any kind was involved  in this stabbing and death. Shirley distinguishes between the Spaniard  and the Mexican; the Doctor does not. As to the presence of \"those  women,\" Shirley, without commenting, sheds much light upon that  subject, as will be perceived from the following extracts. Dr. Royce's  review does not coincide with the facts.        Seven miners from Old Spain, enraged at the cruel treatment which      their countrymen had received on the Fourth,... had united for the      purpose of taking revenge on seven Americans. All well armed,...      intending to challenge each one his man,... on arriving at Indian      Bar ... they drank a most enormous quantity of champagne and      claret. Afterwards they proceeded to [a vile resort kept by an      Englishman], when one of them commenced a playful conversation with      one of his countrywomen. This enraged the Englishman, who instantly      struck the Spaniard a violent blow.... Thereupon ensued a spirited      fight, which ... ended without bloodshed.... Soon after,... Tom      Somers, who is said always to have been a dangerous person when in      liquor, without any apparent provocation struck Domingo (one of the      original seven) a violent blow.... The latter,... mad with wine,      rage, and revenge, without an instant's pause drew his knife and      inflicted a fatal wound upon his insulter. [Post, p. 271.]        In the bakeshop, which stands next door to our cabin, young Tom      Somers lay straightened for the grave (he lived but fifteen minutes      after he was wounded), while over his dead body a Spanish woman was      weeping and moaning in the most piteous and heartrending manner.      [Post, p. 264.]        Domingo, with a Mexicana hanging upon his arm, and brandishing      threateningly the long, bloody knife,... was parading up and down      the street unmolested.... The [Americans] rallied and made a rush      at the murderer, who immediately plunged into the river and swam      across,... and without doubt is now safe in Mexico. [Post, p. 263.]    A disregard of exactness is not peculiar to Dr. Royce. Secondary  authorities are generally open to criticism. Of the authenticity of  Shirley's facts there can be no question. Dr. Royce recognized this,  while subjecting the work of other writers to severe scrutiny. But  Shirley's printer did her much evil. It is not necessary here to say  much concerning trade usages in making an author's manuscript  presentable in type,--the essentially different ways of and differences  between the job, the newspaper, and the book printer. Shirley's  letters, not having been written for publication, required exceptional  care while being put in type, and especially so since the manuscript  was not prepared for the press. It is amusing to read what the printers  of the Pioneer have to say of themselves.        Our facilities for doing FINE BOOK WORK, are very great, possessing      as we do, large founts of new type, and an ADAMS POWER PRESS. We      refer to the Pioneer Magazine, as a specimen. We have in use a      MAMMOTH PRESS, which gives us a great advantage in the execution of      the LARGEST SIZE MAMMOTH POSTERS, in colors or plain.    In the estimation of the printers, the materiel was the principal  thing; the personnel, not worthy of mention,--and it so happened that  it wasn't, for, judging from the typographical inaccuracies of the  Pioneer, the compositors were of a very low order of intelligence, and  if a proof-reader was employed, he assuredly stood high in their  estimation, as he evidently caused them but little trouble.    Much has been said by writers on matters typographical as to what is  meet and necessary in the reprinting of a book, and much more on  literary blunders and mistakes. Some printers are rash, and perpetrate  a worse blunder than that attempted to be corrected in reprinting.  Worse than such people are the amateur proof-readers, who generally run  to extremes, that is, they either cannot see a blunder, and hence pass  it unchallenged, or else they manifest a disposition to challenge and  \"improve\" everything they do not comprehend, and, knowing nothing of  typographical usages or style, they are a decidedly malignant quantity.    Every old printer knows, what is often said, that English is a  grammarless tongue, and that no grammarian ever wrote a sentence worth  reading. No proof-reader, with the experience of a printer behind him,  will change a logically expressed idea so as to make it conform to  grammatical rules, nor will he harass the author thereof with  suggestions looking to that end.    Critical readers of these Letters must ever bear in mind the fact that  Shirley was not writing for publication, and that the printer of this  edition had no desire to and did not alter Shirley's text to suit his  ideas of what was fitting and proper, further than to smooth or round  out in many instances rugged or careless construction. Punctuation,  hyphenization, capitalization, italicizing, spelling, required much,  and of course received much, attention.    In some instances where Shirley"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#3)"],[1," two!\" came the cry.    \"Not much! Here is where we score!\"    But alas for the hopes of Hixley High! The next man up went out on  strikes, and the fellow to follow knocked a foul which was easily  gathered in by the third baseman.    \"Now here is where we bring home the bacon!\" cried Ned Lowe, one of  the Colby Hall fans.    Andy Rover had been burning to distinguish himself, and now his chance  came. First to the bat, he made a very neat base hit. Then, however,  came an out, and the Colby Hall boys were, for a moment, downcast. But  they quickly recovered when the next player made a single and Andy  slid around safely to third.    \"Now then, a hit! Just a neat little hit!\" came the entreating cry.    \"Oh, if only they do get it!\" murmured Ruth Stevenson. \"I wish Jack  was at the bat.\"    \"It's my cousin Dick!\" cried May Powell, and she was right--Spouter  Powell was up.    Spouter was not a particularly strong ball player, but he had one  feature which was in his favor--he knew how to keep cool, and that  helped greatly in this heart-breaking emergency. He waited calmly  until two strikes and two balls had been called, and then he struck a  low one, sending it just inside the first-base line. It slipped past  the baseman, and as Spouter's feet crossed the bag, Fred Rover slid in  safely to the home plate.    \"Hurrah! Hurrah! Colby Hall wins!\"    Then followed a wild cheering and yelling, in the midst of which the  crowds on the bleachers and the grandstand broke forth to mingle with  the players on the ball field. Of course, the Hixley High students  were much crestfallen, yet they tried to take their defeat in good  part.    \"Three cheers for Hixley High!\" shouted Gif Garrison, and they were  given with a will. Then followed a cheer from the high-school students  for those of the military academy, and then the crowd started to  disperse.    \"Oh, boys! some celebration to-night, what?\" cried Randy Rover, and in  the exuberance of his spirits he turned several handsprings on the  grass.    \"You bet we'll celebrate!\" exclaimed his cousin Fred.    \"Say! we ought to shoot off the old cannon for this,\" burst out Andy  Rover. He referred to an ancient fieldpiece located on the front lawn  of the school.    \"Too dangerous,\" interposed his cousin Jack. \"That old cannon is too  rusty, and it would fly into a million pieces.\"    \"Yes, but we might----\"    _Boom!_    It was a loud explosion coming from a considerable distance. The  cadets, as well as all the others gathered on the ball field, looked  at each other in surprise.    \"What could that have been?\" questioned Fred Rover.    \"Sounds like a big cannon going off,\" answered Walt Baxter.    _Boom! Boom!_    Two more explosions rent the air, both much louder than the first. The  very ground seemed to be shaken by the concussion.    \"Say, that sounds like a warship!\"    \"No warships around here,\" was the answer.    \"Maybe it's a German Zeppelin!\"    \"Gee! do you suppose the Germans have come over here to bombard us?\"    _Boom! Boom! Boom!_    Several more explosions came now close upon the others, each explosion  heavier than those which had gone before. The ground all around seemed  to tremble, and those who were still in the grandstand cried out in  alarm.    \"The grandstand is going down! Everybody jump for his life!\"    \"Look! Look!\" was the sudden cry from Jack Rover, and he pointed to a  place on the opposite shore of Clearwater Lake. A dense volume of  smoke was rolling skyward. Then came another tremendous explosion, and  a mass of wreckage could be seen to be lifted skyward.    \"It's the Hasley ammunition factory going up!\" cried Fred Rover. \"What  an awful thing to happen!\"    \"That factory is right across the lake from our school!\" cried Martha  Rover. \"I wonder if it will damage that place any?\"    \"I shouldn't be surprised,\" answered her cousin Andy. And then he  added quickly: \"I hope Mary will be safe.\"    \"Oh, oh! do you think Mary is in danger?\" cried Ruth Stevenson, who  had just joined the others. Mary was Fred Rover's sister, who had been  left behind at the girls' boarding school because she had been  suffering that day with a severe headache, and had said she preferred  resting to attending the ball game, even though she loved to be with  the others.    \"There goes another building!\" yelled Andy Rover, as another report  rent the air. Then those who were looking down the river and across  the lake saw some strange objects being hurled through the sky in the  direction of Clearwater Hall.    \"If that whole ammunition factory starts to go up, it will certainly  mean damage to the boarding school,\" declared Jack. \"I guess the best  we can do is to get down there and see if Mary is safe.\"    \"That's just what I say!\" declared Fred. \"I'm going to get down there  just as fast as I can.\" And he ran off, to board one of the  automobiles headed in that direction.    Now, I know it will not be at all necessary to introduce the Rover  boys or their friends to my old readers, but for the benefit of those  who have not perused any of my former stories a few words concerning  these characters will be necessary. In the first volume, entitled \"The  Rover Boys at School,\" I told how three brothers, Dick, Tom, and Sam  Rover, were sent off to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they made  a great number of friends, including a youth named Lawrence Colby.  From Putnam Hall the lads went to Brill College, and on leaving that  institution of learning went into business in New York City with  offices on Wall Street. They organized The Rover Company, of which  Dick was now president, Tom secretary and general manager, and Sam  treasurer.    While at Putnam Hall the three Rovers had become acquainted with three  very charming girls, Dora Stanhope and her two cousins, Nellie and  Grace Laning, and when Dick went into business he made Dora Stanhope  his lifelong partner. A short time later Tom married Nellie Laning and  Sam married Grace.    The three brothers purchased a fine plot of ground on Riverside Drive  overlooking the noble Hudson River, and there they built three  connecting houses, Dick and his family living in the middle house,  with Tom on one side and Sam on the other.    About a year after their marriage Dick and his wife became the proud  parents of a little son, who was named John after Mr. Laning. This son  was followed by a daughter, called Martha after her great-aunt Martha  of Valley Brook Farm, where the older Rovers had spent many of their  younger days. Little Jack, as he was commonly called, was a manly lad  with many of the qualities which had made his father so well liked and  so successful.    It was about this time that Tom and Nellie Rover came to the front  with a surprise for all of the others. This was in the shape of a pair  of very lively twins, one of whom was named Anderson, after his  grandfather, and the other, Randolph, after his great-uncle Randolph  of Valley Brook Farm. Andy and Randy, as they were always called, were  very active lads, in that particular being a second edition of their  father.    About the time Tom's twins were born Sam and Grace Rover came along  with a beautiful little girl, whom they named Mary after Mrs. Laning.  Then, a year later, the girl was followed by a sturdy boy, christened  Fred after Sam Rover's old and well-known school chum, Fred Garrison.    Residing so close together, the younger generation of Rover boys, as  well as their sisters, were brought up very much like one family. They  spent their winters usually in New York City, and during the summer  often went out to Valley Brook Farm, where their grandfather, Anderson  Rover, still resided with Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.    At first the boys and girls had been sent to private schools in the  Metropolis; but soon the lads, led by Andy and Randy, showed such a  propensity for \"cutting loose\" that their parents were compelled to  hold a consultation.    \"We'll have to do as Uncle Randolph did with us,\" said Dick Rover.  \"We'll have to send them to some strict boarding school--some military  academy.\" And to this the others had agreed.    Some time previous their old school chum, Lawrence Colby, who had  since become a colonel in the state militia, had opened a military  academy, called Colby Hall.    \"We'll send them to that place,\" was the decision of the older Rovers.  \"Lawrence Colby is just the fellow to make them behave themselves, and  as we are such good friends he will be sure to give them extra  attention.\"    So the boys were sent off to this school, as related in detail in the  first volume of my second series, entitled \"The Rover Boys at Colby  Hall.\" This military school was located about half a mile from the  town of Haven Point on Clearwater Lake, a beautiful sheet of water  about two miles long and nearly half a mile wide. At the head of the  lake was the Rick Rack River, running down from the hills and woods  beyond.    The school consisted of a large stone building, facing the river at a  point not far from where the stream emptied into the lake. It was a  three-storied structure, and contained the classrooms and a mess hall  and also the dormitories and private rooms for the scholars. Close by  was a smaller brick building, occupied by Colonel Colby and his family  and some of the professors.    On the opposite side was an up-to-date gymnasium, while at the water's  edge were a number of small buildings used as boathouses and bathing  pavilions. Behind the hall were a stable and barn, and also a garage,  and further back were a large garden and several farm fields and a  great athletic field where the boys played baseball in the spring and  football in the fall.    On arriving at Colby Hall the young Rovers had found several of their  friends awaiting them, one of these being Dick Powell, the son of  Songbird Powell, a former schoolmate of their fathers. Dick was always  called Spouter because of his fondness for long"]]]
