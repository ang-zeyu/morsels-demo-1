(#3)"],[1," are ranked by naturalists as varieties or geographical races. We  shall see how difficult, or rather how impossible it often is, to  distinguish between races and sub-species, as the less well-marked forms  have sometimes been denominated; and again between sub-species and true  species. I shall further attempt to show that it is the common and widely  ranging, or, as they may be called, the dominant species, which most  frequently vary; and that it is the large and flourishing genera which  include the greatest number of varying species. Varieties, as we shall see,  may justly be called incipient species.    But it may be urged, granting that organic beings in a state of nature  present some varieties,--that their organization is in some slight degree  plastic; granting that many animals and plants have varied greatly under  domestication, and that man by his power of selection has gone on  accumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked and firmly  inherited races; granting all this, how, it may be asked, have species  arisen in a state of nature? The differences between natural varieties are  slight; whereas the differences are {5} considerable between the species of  the same genus, and great between the species of distinct genera. How do  these lesser differences become augmented into the greater difference? How  do varieties, or as I have called them incipient species, become converted  into true and well-defined species? How has each new species been adapted  to the surrounding physical conditions, and to the other forms of life on  which it in any way depends? We see on every side of us innumerable  adaptations and contrivances, which have justly excited in the mind of  every observer the highest admiration. There is, for instance, a fly  (Cecidomyia)[3] which deposits its eggs within the stamens of a  Scrophularia, and secretes a poison which produces a gall, on which the  larva feeds; but there is another insect (Misocampus) which deposits its  eggs within the body of the larva within the gall, and is thus nourished by  its living prey; so that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous  insect, and this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a  particular organ of a particular plant. So it is, in a more or less plainly  marked manner, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases, with the lowest  as well as with the highest productions of nature.    This problem of the conversion of varieties into species,--that is, the  augmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into the  greater differences characteristic of species and genera, including the  admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic  conditions of life,--will form the main subject of my second work. We shall  therein see that all organic beings, without exception, tend to increase at  so high a ratio, that no district, no station, not even the whole surface  of the land or the whole ocean, would hold the progeny of a single pair  after a certain number of generations. The inevitable result is an  ever-recurrent Struggle for Existence. It has truly been said that all  nature is at war; the strongest ultimately prevail, the weakest fail; and  we well know that myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the  earth. If then organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight  degree, owing to changes in the surrounding {6} conditions, of which we  have abundant geological evidence, or from any other cause; if, in the long  course of ages, inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous  to any being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life;  and it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise,  seeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his own  profit or pleasure; if then these contingencies ever occur, and I do not  see how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted, then the severe  and often-recurrent struggle for existence will determine that those  variations, however slight, which are favourable shall be preserved or  selected, and those which are unfavourable shall be destroyed.    This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess  any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called  Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea  by the Survival of the Fittest. The term \"natural selection\" is in some  respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be  disregarded after a little familiarity. No one objects to chemists speaking  of \"elective affinity;\" and certainly an acid has no more choice in  combining with a base, than the conditions of life have in determining  whether or not a new form be selected or preserved. The term is so far a  good one as it brings into connection the production of domestic races by  man's power of selection, and the natural preservation of varieties and  species in a state of nature. For brevity sake I sometimes speak of natural  selection as an intelligent power;--in the same way as astronomers speak of  the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets, or as  agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of  selection. In the one case, as in the other, selection does nothing without  variability, and this depends in some manner on the action of the  surrounding circumstances on the organism. I have, also, often personified  the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but  I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural  laws,--and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events. {7}    In the chapter devoted to natural selection I shall show from experiment  and from a multitude of facts, that the greatest amount of life can be  supported on each spot by great diversification or divergence in the  structure and constitution of its inhabitants. We shall, also, see that the  continued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies  that each new variety has some advantage over others, almost inevitably  leads to the extermination of the older and less improved forms. These  latter are almost necessarily intermediate in structure as well as in  descent between the last-produced forms and their original parent-species.  Now, if we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in  the course of time to produce other varieties, the principle of good being  derived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the  preservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences  characteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater  differences characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the  older intermediate forms, new species come to be distinctly defined  objects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that organic beings can be  classed by what is called a natural method in distinct groups--species  under genera, and genera under families.    As all the inhabitants of each country may be said, owing to their high  rate of reproduction, to be striving to increase in numbers; as each form  is related to many other forms in the struggle for life,--for destroy any  one and its place will be seized by others; as every part of the  organization occasionally varies in some slight degree, and as natural  selection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are  advantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being  is exposed, no limit exists to the number, singularity, and perfection of  the contrivances and co-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal  or a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in  the most intricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the  physical conditions of its home. Variations in the organization will in  some cases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they  will be governed by the direct action {8} of the surrounding physical  conditions and by correlation of growth.    On the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or  necessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of  organization. We are almost compelled to look at the specialization or  differentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or  even sole standard of advancement; for by such division of labour each  function of body and mind is better performed. And, as natural selection  acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of  structure, and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more  and more complex, from the increasing number of different forms which  inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect  structure, we may confidently believe, that, on the whole, organization  advances. Nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions  of life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or unimproved; for what  would it profit an infusorial animalcule, for instance, or an intestinal  worm, to become highly organized? Members of a high group might even  become, and this apparently has occurred, fitted for simpler conditions of  life; and in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade  the organization, for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be  useless or even disadvantageous.    In a second work, after treating of the Variation of organisms in a state  of nature, of the Struggle for Existence and the principle of Natural  Selection, I shall discuss the difficulties which are opposed to the  theory. These difficulties may be classed under the following heads:--the  apparent impossibility in some cases of a very simple organ graduating by  small steps into a highly perfect organ; the marvellous facts of Instinct;  the whole"]]]
