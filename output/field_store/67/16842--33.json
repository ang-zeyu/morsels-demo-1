He tried to revive her, to bring her back.    She only whispered, \"Good-bye, my love. I am going fast. You will see me  no more, but come to this place a year from now. It may be Maka Ina will  be kind, and will send you a little one that is yours and mine.\"    Her white body melted away, as he bent over it and wept.    He came back every morning, but saw Snowroba no more. One year from that  day, as he lingered sadly over the sacred spot, he saw a new and  wonderful flower come forth. Its bloom was of the tenderest violet blue,  and it was full of expression. As he gazed, he saw those eyes again; the  scalding tears dropped from his eyes, and burned its leaves into a  blotched and brownish colour. He remembered, and understood her promise  now. He knew that this was their blue-eyed little one.    In the early springtime we can see it. Three sunny days on the edge of  the snowdrift will bring it forth. The hunterfolk who find it, say that  it is just one of the spring flowers, out earlier than any other, and is  called Liverleaf, but we Woodcrafters know better. We know it is  Hepatica, the child of El Sol and Snowroba.      TALE 2    The Story of the White Dawnsinger    or    How the Bloodroot Came    Have you noticed that there are no snow-white birds in our woods during  summer? Mother Carey long ago made it a rule that all snow-white  landbirds should go north, when the snow was gone in the springtime. And  they were quite obedient; they flew, keeping just on the south edge of  the melting snow.    But it so happened that one of the sweetest singers of all--the  snow-white Dawnsinger with the golden bill and the ruby legs--was flying  northward with his bride, when she sprained her wing so she could not  fly at all.    There was no other help for it; they must stay in that thicket till her  wing grew strong again.    The other white birds flew on, but the Dawnsinger waited. He sang his  merriest songs to cheer her. He brought her food: and he warned her when  enemies were near.    A moon had come and gone. Now she was well again, and strong on the  wing. He was anxious to go on to their northern home. A second warning  came from Mother Carey, \"White birds go north.\"    But the sunny woodside had become very pleasant, food was abundant, and  the little white lady said, \"Why should we go north when it is so much  nicer right here?\"    The Dawnsinger felt the same way, and the next time the warning came,  \"White birds go north,\" he would not listen at all, and they settled  down to a joyful life in the woods.    They did not know anything about the Yellow-eyed Whizz. They never would  have known, had they gone north at their right time. But the Yellow-eyed  Whizz was coming. It came, and It always goes straight after white  things in the woods, for brown things It cannot see.    Dawnsinger was high on a tree, praising the light in a glorious song,  that he had just made up, when It singled him out by his whiteness, and  pierced him through.    He fell fluttering and dying; and as she flew to him, with a cry of  distress, the Yellow-eyed wicked Whizz struck her down by his side.    The Chewinks scratched leaves over the two white bodies, and--I  think--that Mother Carey dropped a tear on the place.    That was the end of the White Dawnsinger and his bride. Yet every year,  at that same place, as the snow goes, the brown leaves move and part,  and up from beneath there comes a beautiful white flower.    [Illustration: The Story of the White Dawnsinger]    Its bloom threads are yellow like the Dawnsinger's beak, and its stem is  ruby like his legs; all the rest is snow-white like his plumes. It  rises, looks about, faces the sun, and sings a little odour-song, a  little aroma-lay. If you look deep down into the open soul of the  Dawnsinger you will see the little golden thoughts he sings about. Then  up from the same grave comes another, just the same, but a little  smaller, and for a while they stand up side by side, and praise the  light. But the Wither-bloom that haunts the flowers as the Yellow-eyed  Whizz does the birds, soon finds them out; their song is ended, their  white plumes are scattered, and they shrink back into their grave, to be  side by side again.    You can find their little bodies, but deal gently with them, for they  are wounded; you may make them bleed again.    And when you hear the Chewinks scratching in the underbrush, remember  they are putting leaves on the grave of the White Dawnsinger.           *       *       *       *       *    Surely you have guessed the secret; the flower is the Bloodroot, and the  Whizz is the Sharp-shinned Hawk.      TALE 3    The Prairie-girl with Yellow Hair    [Illustration: The Prairie-girl]    Tall and fair was the Prairie-girl. She was not very pretty, but her  form was slender and graceful, and her head was covered with a mass of  golden hair that made you see her from afar off. It has been whispered  that she was deeply in love with El Sol, for wherever he went, she  turned her head to look at him; and when she could not see him, she  drooped and languished. But he never seemed to notice her. As she grew  older her golden head turned white, and at last the swish of Mother  Carey's horses carried away all her white hair, and left her old, bald,  and ugly. So she pined and died, and Maka Ina buried her poor little  body under the grass. But some say it was Father Time that blew her hair  away, and that El Sol had the body cremated.           *       *       *       *       *    If you look on the lawns or the fields in springtime, you are sure to  find the Prairie-girl. The Guide can show her to you, if you do not  know her. But he will call her \"Common Dandelion,\" and I do not know of  any flower that has so many things for us children to remember.    If you are learning French, you will see how it got the name  \"Dandelion\"; it used to be written _dent de lion_; that is, \"tooth of a  lion\"; because its leaves are edged with sharp teeth, like a lion's jaw.    Its golden-yellow flower is said to open when the Swallows arrive from  the south, that is, in April; and though it blooms chiefly in springtime  it keeps on blooming till long after the Swallows fly away. It certainly  thrives as long as the sun shines on it, and fades when the cold dark  season comes. But I have seen it out in November; that is, the Dandelion  blooms for fully nine months. I do not know of any other flower that  does; most of them are done in one month.    When the yellow flower is over, its place is taken by a beautiful globe  of soft, white plumes; this is why the story says its golden hair turns  white with age. The children believe that this woolly head will tell you  the time of day. You hold it up, then pretend you are Father Time  blowing her hair away, blow a sharp puff with your breath, then another  and another, till the plumes are blown away. If it takes four blows,  they say it means four o'clock; but it is not a very true clock.    Some children make a wish, then blow once and say, \"this year\"; the  second time, \"next year\"; the third time, \"some time\"; the fourth time,  \"never.\" Then begin all over, and keep on as long as any plumes are  left, to tell when the wish is coming true.    Now pull the head off the stalk. You will find it leaves a long, open  tube that sounds like a trumpet when you blow through it from the small  end. If you force your finger into the big end, and keep pushing, you  split the tube into two or three pieces; put these in your mouth and  they will curl up like ringlets. Some children hang these on their ears  for ornaments. Take a stalk for each year of your age; pull its head  off. Then you will find that the top end will go into the bottom and  make a ring. Use all the stalks you have gathered, to make a chain; now  throw this chain into a low tree. If it sticks the first time, your wish  will come true this year. Each time it falls puts your wish a year  farther away.    This may not be true; but it is a game to play. Some big girls use it,  to find out when they are going to be married.    Now dig up the whole plant, root and all--the gardener will be much  obliged to you for doing so--take it home, and ask the Guide to make the  leaves into a salad; you will find it good to eat; most Europeans eat it  regularly, either raw, or boiled as greens.    Last of all, ask the Guide to roast the root, till it is brown and  crisp, then grind it in a coffee-mill, and use it to make coffee. Some  people think it better than real coffee; at any rate, the doctors say it  is much healthier, for it is nourishing food, and does not do one any  harm at all. But perhaps you will not like it. You may think all the  time you are eating the body of the poor little Prairie-girl, who died  of love.      TALE 4    The Cat's-eye Toad, a Child of Maka Ina    When you were little, O Guide! didn't you delight in the tales of gnomes  or _nibelungen_, those strange underground creatures that lived hidden  from the light, and busied themselves with precious stones and metals?  How unwillingly we gave up those glad beliefs, as we inevitably grew old  and lost our fairyland eyes!    [Illustration: The Cat's eye Toad (life size)]    But you must not give up all your joyful creeds; you must keep on  believing in the weird underground dwarfs; for I am going to tell you of  one that the cold calculating Professor Science has at last accepted,  and that lives in your own back-yard. That is, the Cat's-eye Toad or  Spadefoot. It is much like a common Toad, but a little smoother, the  digging spade on its hind foot is bigger and its eye, its beautiful  gold-stone eye, has the pupil up and down like that of a Cat, instead of  level as in its cousin, the warty Hoptoad.    But the wonderful thing about the Cat's-eye is that it spends most of  its life underground, coming out in the early"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23668"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Salisbury (#3)"],[1," their alms with a  ready mind according to the ability which God had given them. But in  process of time the nobility being returned from Wales, several of  them came thither, and laid a stone, binding themselves to some  special contribution for the whole seven years following.\"    Another account, differing from the more generally accepted version  just quoted, says that: Pendulph, the Pope's legate, in 1216 laid the  first five stones; the first for the Pope, the second for the King,  the third for the Earl of Salisbury, the fourth for the countess, and  the fifth for the bishop. This statement is wrong in date, for Bishop  Poore was not translated to the see of Sarum until the year 1217. In  the charter of Henry I. the first stone is mentioned as having been  laid by the king, _i.e._, in his name.    \"On the 15th of August, 1220, at a general chapter when the bishop was  present, it was provided that if any canon of the church failed paying  what he had promised to the fabric for seven years, that next after  fifteen days from the term elapsed, some one should be sent on the  part of the bishop and chapter to raise what was due from the corn  found on the prebend, and so long as he should remain there for that  purpose he should be maintained with all necessaries by the goods of  the said prebend. But if the prebend or any person failing in the  payment of what was promised be in any other bishopric than Sarum,  such canon should be denounced to that bishop by the letter of the  bishop and chapter for his contumacy, either to be suspended from  entering the church, or from celebration of divine service, or  excommunicated according as the chapter shall judge it.\"    In the year 1225, Richard Poore, Bishop of Sarum, \"finding the fabric  of the new church was by God's alliance so far advanced that divine  service might be conveniently performed therein, he rejoiced  exceedingly, since he bestowed great pains and contributed greatly  towards it. Thereupon he commanded William the Dean to cite all the  canons to be present on the day of S. Michael following, at the joyful  solemnity of their mother church, that is to say, at the first  celebration of divine service therein. According on the vigil of S.  Michael, which happened on a Sunday, the bishop came in the morning  and consecrated three altars, the first in the east part, in honour of  the holy and undivided Trinity and All Saints, on which henceforth the  mass of the Blessed Virgin was appointed to be said every day. And the  said bishop offered that day for the service of the said altar and for  daily service of the Blessed Virgin, two silver basons and two silver  candlesticks which were bequeathed by the will of the noble lady  Gundria de Warren to the church of Sarum. Moreover the bishop gave out  of his property to the clerks that were to officiate at the said mass  thirty marks of silver a year until he settled so much in certain  rents, and likewise ten marks every year to maintain lamps round the  said altar. Then he dedicated another altar in the north part of the  church in honour of St. Peter, the prince of the apostles, and the  rest of the apostles; he also dedicated another altar in the south  part thereof to St. Stephen and the rest of the martyrs. At this  dedication were present: Henry, Bishop of Dublin, Stephen, Lord  Archbishop of Canterbury.\"    We read further in the same chronicle that the bishops and their  retinues were entertained for a week by Bishop Poore at his sole  charge.    The next day, the feast of SS. Michael and All Angels, the Archbishop  of Canterbury preached to a large company including many English and  foreign prelates, Otto, the Pope's nuncio, and others. On the Thursday  following, \"Our Lord the King and Hubert de Burgh the justice came to  the church and the King there heard the mass of the glorious Virgin  and offered ten marks of silver and one piece of silk, and he granted  to the same place that every year there should be a fair.\" The same  day the justice made a vow that he would give a gold text set in the  precious stones and the relics of divers saints in honour of the  Blessed Virgin Mary, and the service of the new church; afterwards the  King went down with many of his nobles to the Bishop's palace and were  entertained. On the Friday following Hubert de Burgh offered his  \"texte after John, gilt with gold and having precious stones and  relics of divers saints.\"    \"On the Nativity of our Lord following, the King and his justice  Hubert de Burgh came to Sarum on the day of the Holy Innocents, and  there the King offered one gold ring with a precious stone called a  ruby, one piece of silk, and one gold cup of the weight of ten marks;  and when the mass was celebrated the King told the dean that he would  have that stone which he had offered and the gold of the ring applied  to adorn the text which the justice had before given; and then the  justice caused the text which he had given to be brought and offered  with great devotion on the altar.\"    On the 10th of January, 1226, William Longespee, Earl of Salisbury,  returned from Gascoigne, where he had resided twelve months with  Richard, the King's brother, for the defence of Bordeaux (after three  months on the channel between the Isle of Rhe and the coast of  Cornwall, owing to the tempestuous weather, that so long delayed his  landing), \"and the said Earl came that day after nine o'clock to  Sarum, where he was received with great joy, with a procession for the  new fabric.\" The scandalous account of his death (as given by Stow),  which occurred at the castle of Old Sarum, on the 7th of March in the  same year, and the part played in the transaction by Hubert de Burgh  cannot be told here, beyond the fact that the justice was strongly  suspected of poisoning him. On the 8th of March, at the same hour of  the day on which he had been received with great joy, he was brought  to New Sarum with many tears and lamentations, and honourably buried  in the new church of the Blessed Virgin. Matthew Paris gravely records  that at his funeral, despite gusts of wind and rain, the candles  furnished a continual light the whole of the way. Of all secular  figures connected with this cathedral his is perhaps the most  prominent, nor is his fame merely local. He was active in public  affairs during the reign of King John, and one of the noticeable  heroes in an expedition to the Holy Land in 1220, when, at the battle  of Damietta, Matthew Paris tells us, he resisted the shock of the  infidels like a wall. He fought both in Flanders and in France, was at  his King's side at Runnymede, and a witness to Magna Charta--a copy of  which famous charter, made probably for his special use, is still  preserved in the cathedral library.    In 1226, on the Feast of the Holy Trinity, which was then the 18th day  of the calends of July, the bodies of the three bishops, Jocelin,  Roger, and Osmund (the latter not yet canonized), were brought from  Old Sarum. Whether their tombs were also brought, is not said, nor is  any mention made of Herman, who by popular report is credited with a  monument in the cathedral.    A Charter of Henry III., dated 30th of January, 1227, gives certain  powers to make new roads and bridges, to inclose the city of New  Saresbury, to institute a fair from the Vigil of the Assumption of the  Blessed Mary to the octave of the same feast, etc., etc. This  development of the city, more especially by its roads and bridges, is  held to have been fatal to the prosperity of Wilton, which from that  time ceased to progress, and was over-shadowed by the now rapidly  increasing New Sarum.    Bishop Poore was ably supported in his great undertaking by a group of  notable men, among whom were: William de Wanda, the Dean, who threw  his whole soul into the work, and traversed the diocese of London to  collect alms in its behalf, besides leaving us most elaborate accounts  of the various ceremonies; and the Precentor, Roger de Sarum, a man of  some weight, who soon after became Bishop of Bath and Wells; Henry de  Bishopston, a learned man and a scholar, should also be remembered,  and, if Leland could be credited, we should need to add another member  to this group, and find in Robert Hilcot, of Sarum, the author of the  \"Philobiblon\" so generally attributed to Richard de Bury.    After Bishop Poore was translated to Durham, his three successors,  Bishops Robert Bingham (1229-1246), William of York (1247-1256), and  Giles of Bridport (1257-1262), continued the works of the new building  with great energy. In 1258 it was consecrated--some accounts say by  Bishop Giles of Bridport, \"who covered the roof throughout with lead,\"  but more probably by Boniface of Savoy, Archbishop of Canterbury.  Henry III. and his queen were present at the consecration; and as  indulgences of a year and forty days were offered to all who should be  present during the octave of the dedication, vast crowds visited it.  It was not entirely completed according to a note in a Book of  Statutes, until 1266, and it has been said that with all our modern  appliances we could hardly shorten the forty-six years it occupied.  The cost of the whole building, according to ancient authority, was  about 40,000 marks, equal to L26,666 13s. 4d., of the money of that  day, and probably equivalent roughly to half a million in our own  time. Among many benefactors, one, Lady Alicia Bruere, who according  to Leland contributed the marble and stone for twelve years, deserves  to be mentioned. The cloisters and chapter house were not commenced  until the episcopate of Bishop Walter de la Wyle (1263-1271) and  possibly not completed until some ten years later. From the will of  Robert de Careville, the treasurer in 1267, we find that there were  seven altars in the church at this date; he bequeathed seven pounds to  provide fourteen silver phials (each bearing a representation of three  keys) in order"]]]
