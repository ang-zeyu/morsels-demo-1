VON JAGOW.          The American Rejoinder    THE SECRETARY OF STATE AT WASHINGTON TO THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AT  BERLIN      DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  Washington, July 21, 1915.    The Secretary of State to Ambassador Gerard:    You are instructed to deliver textually the following note to the  Minister for Foreign Affairs:    The note of the Imperial German Government, dated the 8th day of July,  1915, has received the careful consideration of the Government of the  United States, and it regrets to be obliged to say that it has found  it very unsatisfactory, because it fails to meet the real differences  between the two Governments, and indicates no way in which the  accepted principles of law and humanity may be applied in the grave  matter in controversy, but proposes, on the contrary, arrangements for  a partial suspension of those principles which virtually set them  aside.    The Government of the United States notes with satisfaction that the  Imperial German Government recognizes without reservation the validity  of the principles insisted on in the several communications which this  Government has addressed to the Imperial German Government with regard  to its announcement of a war zone and the use of submarines against  merchantmen on the high seas--the principle that the high seas are  free, that the character and cargo of a merchantman must first be  ascertained before she can lawfully be seized or destroyed, and that  the lives of noncombatants may in no case be put in jeopardy unless  the vessel resists or seeks to escape after being summoned to submit  to examination, for a belligerent act of retaliation is per se an act  beyond the law, and the defense of an act as retaliatory is an  admission that it is illegal.    The Government of the United States is, however, keenly disappointed  to find that the Imperial German Government regards itself as in large  degree exempt from the obligation to observe these principles, even  when neutral vessels are concerned, by what it believes the policy and  practice of the Government of Great Britain to be in the present war  with regard to neutral commerce. The Imperial German Government will  readily understand that the Government of the United States cannot  discuss the policy of the Government of Great Britain with regard to  neutral trade except with that Government itself, and that it must  regard the conduct of other belligerent governments as irrelevant to  any discussion with the Imperial German Government of what this  Government regards as grave and unjustifiable violations of the  rights of American citizens by German naval commanders.    Illegal and inhuman acts, however justifiable they may be thought to  be, against an enemy who is believed to have acted in contravention of  law and humanity, are manifestly indefensible when they deprive  neutrals of their acknowledged rights, particularly when they violate  the right to life itself. If a belligerent cannot retaliate against an  enemy without injuring the lives of neutrals, as well as their  property, humanity, as well as justice and a due regard for the  dignity of neutral powers, should dictate that the practice be  discontinued. If persisted in it would in such circumstances  constitute an unpardonable offense against the sovereignty of the  neutral nation affected.    The Government of the United States is not unmindful of the  extraordinary conditions created by this war or of the radical  alterations of circumstance and method of attack produced by the use  of instrumentalities of naval warfare which the nations of the world  cannot have had in view when the existing rules of international law  were formulated, and it is ready to make every reasonable allowance  for these novel and unexpected aspects of war at sea; but it cannot  consent to abate any essential or fundamental right of its people  because of a mere alteration of circumstance. The rights of neutrals  in time of war are based upon principle, not upon expediency, and the  principles are immutable. It is the duty and obligation of  belligerents to find a way to adapt the new circumstances to them.    The events of the past two months have clearly indicated that it is  possible and practicable to conduct such submarine operations as have  characterized the activity of the Imperial German Navy within the  so-called war zone in substantial accord with the accepted practices  of regulated warfare. The whole world has looked with interest and  increasing satisfaction at the demonstration of that possibility by  German naval commanders. It is manifestly possible, therefore, to lift  the whole practice of submarine attack above the criticism which it  has aroused and remove the chief causes of offense.    In view of the admission of illegality made by the Imperial Government  when it pleaded the right of retaliation in defense of its acts, and  in view of the manifest possibility of conforming to the established  rules of naval warfare, the Government of the United States cannot  believe that the Imperial Government will longer refrain from  disavowing the wanton act of its naval commander in sinking the  Lusitania or from offering reparation for the American lives lost, so  far as reparation can be made for a needless destruction of human life  by an illegal act.    The Government of the United States, while not indifferent to the  friendly spirit in which it is made, cannot accept the suggestion of  the Imperial German Government that certain vessels be designated and  agreed upon which shall be free on the seas now illegally proscribed.  The very agreement would, by implication, subject other vessels to  illegal attack, and would be a curtailment and therefore an  abandonment of the principles for which this Government contends, and  which in times of calmer counsels every nation would concede as of  course.    The Government of the United States and the Imperial German Government  are contending for the same great object, have long stood together in  urging the very principles upon which the Government of the United  States now so solemnly insists. They are both contending for the  freedom of the seas. The Government of the United States will continue  to contend for that freedom, from whatever quarter violated, without  compromise and at any cost. It invites the practical co-operation of  the Imperial German Government at this time, when co-operation may  accomplish most and this great common object be most strikingly and  effectively achieved.    The Imperial German Government expresses the hope that this object may  be in some measure accomplished even before the present war ends. It  can be. The Government of the United States not only feels obliged to  insist upon it, by whomsoever violated or ignored, in the protection  of its own citizens, but is also deeply interested in seeing it made  practicable between the belligerents themselves, and holds itself  ready at any time to act as the common friend who may be privileged to  suggest a way.    In the meantime the very value which this Government sets upon the  long and unbroken friendship between the people and Government of the  United States and the people and Government of the German nation  impels it to press very solemnly upon the Imperial German Government  the necessity for a scrupulous observance of neutral rights in this  critical matter. Friendship itself prompts it to say to the Imperial  Government that repetition by the commanders of German naval vessels  of acts in contravention of those rights must be regarded by the  Government of the United States, when they affect American citizens,  as deliberately unfriendly.    LANSING.          German and American Press Opinion    ON THE GERMAN NOTE OF JULY 8      The German answer to the United States with regard to submarine  warfare was reported from Berlin on July 10 as having caused the most  intense satisfaction among the Germans and brought relief to them, for  the mere thought that the submarine war would be abandoned would cause  widespread resentment.    The Berlin newspapers printed long editorials approving the  Government's stand and \"conciliatory\" tone. Captain Perseus, in the  Tageblatt, said that the \"new note makes clearer that the present  course will be continued with the greatest possible consideration for  American interests.\" The note \"stands under the motto, 'On the way to  an understanding,' without, however, failing to emphasize the firm  determination that our interests must hold first place,\" in other  words, that Germany \"cannot surrender the advantages that the use of  the submarine weapon gives to the German people.\"    The Lokal Anzeiger of Berlin commented:    \"Feeling has undoubtedly cooled down somewhat on the other side of the  water, and Americans will undoubtedly admit that it is not Germany  that tries to monopolize the freedom of the seas for itself alone.    \"In any event, we have now done our utmost and can quietly await what  answer President Wilson and his advisers will think suitable.\"    George Bernhard in the Vossische Zeitung remarked that the publication  of the note means \"liberation from many of the doubts that have  excited a large part of the German people in recent weeks. The note  ... means unconditional refusal to let any outsider prescribe to us  how far and with what weapons we may defend ourselves against  England's hunger war.\"    What they considered the moderation of the note impressed most Berlin  newspapers. Thus the Morgen Post said: \"Those who had advised that we  ought to humble ourselves before America will be just as disappointed  as those who thought we ought to bring the fist down on the table and  answer America's representations with a war threat.\"    Count von Reventlow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#3)"],[1,"168  THE PAREDAOZINHO                                                        176  TYPICAL SCENERY OF MATTO GROSSO                                         176  VOLCANIC SCENERY OF MATTO GROSSO (CHAPADA IN FOREGROUND)                184  PECULIAR FORMATION OF CENTRAL PLATEAU                                   184  CURIOUS DOMES OF LAVA WITH UPPER STRATUM OF EARTH, SAND AND ASHES       192  GREAT UNDULATING CAMPOS OF MATTO GROSSO                                 192  TYPICAL BRAZILIAN PLATEAU, SHOWING WORK OF EROSION                      200  ON THE PLATEAU OF MATTO GROSSO (ALCIDES IN FOREGROUND)                  200  A FINE BORORO TYPE ON A VISIT TO AUTHOR'S CAMP                          208  BORORO MEN, SHOWING LIP ORNAMENT                                        216  BORORO MEN                                                              216  BORORO INDIANS                                                          224  BORORO MEN (THE APRONS ARE NOT ACTUALLY WORN)                           228  BORORO WARRIORS                                                         232  BORORO WARRIORS                                                         232  THE HORRORS OF PHOTOGRAPHY: BORORO CHILDREN                             236  BORORO CHIEF RATTLING GOURDS FILLED WITH PEBBLES, IN ORDER TO          CALL MEMBERS OF HIS TRIBE (_Coloured Plate_)                    238  BORORO CHILD SHOWING STRONG MALAY CHARACTERISTICS                       240  BORORO GIRLS                                                            244  BORORO GIRLS (SIDE VIEW)                                                244  BORORO WOMEN, SHOWING METHOD OF CARRYING CHILDREN                       248  BOROROS SHOWING FORMATION OF HANDS                                      248  BORORO WOMEN                                                            252  BORORO WOMEN                                                            252  BOROROS THRASHING INDIAN CORN                                           256  A BORORO BLIND WOMAN                                                    256  BORORO CHILDREN                                                         260  BORORO WOMEN                                                            260  ISOLATED CONICAL HILLS WITH TOWER-LIKE ROCKY FORMATIONS ON SUMMIT       268  THE ENDLESS CAMPOS OF MATTO GROSSO                                      268  GEOMETRICAL PATTERN ON THE SURFACE OF A FLOW OF LAVA          (CAUSED BY SUDDEN CONTRACTION IN COOLING)                       272  THE OBSERVATORY AT THE SALESIAN COLONY.

There is no spot on earth that takes so long to reach.\" (Hearty laughter  at his own wit.)    That exclamation, and wise words that follow, came from the assistant of  one of the largest firms of cinematograph appliances in Paris, where I  had called in order to purchase a moving picture apparatus and 10,000  metres of film to be used on my forthcoming journey across the South  American continent.    The shop assistant had very honestly warned me that if the films were to  be used in a damp, tropical climate, they must be exposed and developed  within three months of their manufacture. After that time they would  become so perforated and fogged as to be quite useless. I had remarked  that it would take me more than three months to reach the spot where I  should begin to take cinematograph pictures.    \"Will Monsieur please tell where is the spot where he would be likely to  use the films?\" continued the assistant, still overcome with surprise.    \"In the heart of Brazil.\"    \"In the heart of Brazil ... in the very heart of Brazil?... _Oh, mon  Dieu! mon Dieu!_\" (More laughter and a look of compassion at me.) \"_Mais  nous avons une de nos maisons tout a fait pres de la!_\" (Why, indeed, we  have one of our factories quite close to there.)    It was then my turn for hearty laughter and the look of compassion.    \"Pray,\" I inquired, \"tell me more exactly. Where is your factory close to  the heart of Brazil?\"    \"It is quite, quite close. It is in Montreal, Canada.... You will send  your films there ... two or three days' journey.... It will take us a  week to develop them ... two or three days for their return journey. In a  fortnight you will have them back again.\"    Quite close, indeed: only a distance of some 65 deg. of latitude--or some  7170 kilometres as the crow flies--with no direct communication by land  or water!    That was the Frenchman's knowledge of geography; but I find that the  average Englishman, unless he is directly interested in those countries,  knows little better, and perhaps even less. Time after time I have been  asked in London if Brazil were not a province of Mexico, and whether it  is not through Brazil that the Americans are cutting the Panama Canal!  There are many who have a vague idea that Brazil is a German colony;  others, more patriotic, who claim it as an English possession. Many of  those who have looked at the map of the world are under the impression  that Spanish is spoken in Brazil, and are surprised when you tell them  that Portuguese happens to be the local language. Others, more  enlightened in their geography by that great play _Charley's Aunt_,  imagine it a great forest of nut trees. Others, more enlightened still,  believe it to be a land where you are constantly walking in avenues  adorned with wonderful orchids, with a sky overhead swarming with birds  of beautiful plumage. I have been asked in all seriousness whether I  found the Andes quite flat--great prairies (the person had heard of the  Argentine _pampas_ and got mixed up)--or whether \"it\" was merely a large  lagoon!    I could quote dozens more of these extreme cases of ignorance, but of one  thing I am certain, and that is, that there are few people in the British  Isles who realize the actual size of the great Brazilian Republic.    Brazil is 8,524,778 square kilometres--with the territory of the Acre  newly acquired from Bolivia, 8,715,778 sq. kil. in extent; that is to  say, it covers an area larger than the United States of North America,  Germany, Portugal, Greece and Montenegro taken together.    Some of the States of the Republic are larger than some of the largest  countries in Europe: such as the State of the Amazonas with 1,894,724 sq.  kil.; the State of Matto Grosso with 1,378,784 sq. kil.; the State of  Para with an area of 1,149,712 sq."]]]
