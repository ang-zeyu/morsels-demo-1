[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#3)"],[1," Legendary Tales (pp. 84-99), is a very poetical  and charming aspect of the Baiame belief. Mr. Hartland says that I will  \"seek to put\" the first set of stories out of court, as \"a kind of  joke with no sacredness about it\". Not I, but the Noongahburrah tribe  themselves make this essential distinction. Mrs. Langloh Parker says:(1)  \"The former series\" (with the low Baiame myths) \"were all such legends  as are told to the black picaninnies; among the present are some they  would not be allowed to hear, touching as they do on sacred things,  taboo to the young\". The blacks draw the line which I am said to seek to  draw.      (1) More Legendary Tales, p. xv.      In yet another case(1) grotesque hunting adventures of Baiame are  told in the mysteries, and illustrated by the sacred temporary  representations in raised earth. I did not know it; I merely followed  Mr. Howitt. But I do not doubt it. My reply is, that there was  \"something sacred\" in Greek mysteries, something purifying, ennobling,  consoling. For this Lobeck has collected (and disparaged) the evidence  of Pindar, Sophocles, Cicero and many others, while even Aristophanes,  as Prof. Campbell remarks, says: \"We only have bright sun and cheerful  life who have been initiated and lived piously in regard to strangers  and to private citizens\".(2) Security and peace of mind, in this world  and for the next, were, we know not how, borne into the hearts of Pindar  and Sophocles in the Mysteries. Yet, if we may at all trust the Fathers,  there were scenes of debauchery, as at the Mysteries of the Fijians  (Nanga) there was buffoonery (\"to amuse the boys,\" Mr. Howitt says of  some Australian rites), the story of Baubo is only one example, and, in  other mysteries than the Eleusinian, we know of mummeries in which an  absurd tale of Zeus is related in connection with an oak log. Yet surely  there was \"something sacred\" in the faith of Zeus! Let us judge the  Australians as we judge Greeks. The precepts as to \"speaking the  straightforward truth,\" as to unselfishness, avoidance of quarrels,  of wrongs to \"unprotected women,\" of unnatural vices, are certainly  communicated in the Mysteries of some tribes, with, in another,  knowledge of the name and nature of \"Our Father,\" Munganngaur. That a  Totemistic dance, or medicine-dance of Emu hunting, is also displayed(3)  at certain Mysteries of a given tribe, and that Baiame is spoken of  as the hero of this ballet, no more deprives the Australian moral and  religious teaching (at the Mysteries) of sacred value, than the stupid  indecency whereby Baubo made Demeter laugh destroys the sacredness of  the Eleusinia, on which Pindar, Sophocles and Cicero eloquently dwell.  If the Australian mystae, at the most solemn moment of their lives, are  shown a dull or dirty divine ballet d'action, what did Sophocles see,  after taking a swim with his pig? Many things far from edifying, yet the  sacred element of religious hope and faith was also represented. So it  is in Australia.      (1) J. A. I., xxiv. p. 416.    (2) Religion in Greek Literature, p. 259. It is to be regretted that the  learned professor gives no references. The Greek Mysteries are treated  later in this volume.    (3) See A picture of Australia, 1829, p. 264.      These studies ought to be comparative, otherwise they are worthless. As  Mr. Hartland calls Daramulun \"an eternal Creator with a game leg\" who  \"died,\" he may call Zeus an \"eternal father, who swallowed his wife,  lay with his mother and sister, made love as a swan, and died, nay, was  buried, in Crete\". I do not think that Mr. Hartland would call Zeus \"a  ghost-god\" (my own phrase), or think that he was scoring a point against  me, if I spoke of the sacred and ethical characteristics of the Zeus  adored by Eumaeus in the Odyssey. He would not be so humorous about  Zeus, nor fall into an ignoratio elenchi. For my point never was  that any Australian tribe had a pure theistic conception unsoiled and  unobliterated by myth and buffoonery. My argument was that AMONG  their ideas is that of a superhuman being, unceasing (if I may not say  eternal), a maker (if I may not say a Creator), a guardian of certain  by no means despicable ethics, which I never proclaimed as supernormally  inspired! It is no reply to me to say that, in or out of Mysteries, low  fables about that being are told, and buffooneries are enacted. For,  though I say that certain high ideas are taught in Mysteries, I do not  think I say that in Mysteries no low myths are told.    I take this opportunity, as the earliest, to apologise for an error in  my Making of Religion concerning a passage in the Primitive Culture of  my friend Mr. E. B. Tylor. Mr. Tylor quoted(1) a passage from Captain  John Smith's History of Virginia, as given in Pinkerton, xiii. pp.  13-39, 1632. In this passage no mention occurs of a Virginian deity  named Ahone but \"Okee,\" another and more truculent god, is named. I  observed that, if Mr. Tylor had used Strachey's Historie of Travaile  (1612), he would have found \"a slightly varying copy\" of Smith's text of  1632, with Ahone as superior to Okee. I added in a note (p. 253): \"There  is a description of Virginia, by W. Strachey, including Smith's remarks  published in 1612. Strachey interwove some of this work with his own MS.  in the British Museum.\" Here, as presently will be shown, I erred, in  company with Strachey's editor of 1849, and with the writer on Strachey  in the Dictionary of National Biography. What Mr. Tylor quoted from an  edition of Smith in 1632 had already appeared, in 1612, in a book  (Map of Virginia, with a description of the Countrey) described on the  title-page as \"written by Captain Smith,\" though, in my opinion, Smith  may have had a collaborator. There is no evidence whatever that Strachey  had anything to do with this book of 1612, in which there is no mention  of Ahone. Mr. Arber dates Strachey's own MS. (in which Ahone occurs) as  of 1610-1615.(2) I myself, for reasons presently to be alleged, date  the MS. mainly in 1611-1612. If Mr. Arber and I are right, Strachey must  have had access to Smith's MS. before it was published in 1612, and we  shall see how he used it. My point here is that Strachey mentioned Ahone  (in MS.) before Smith's book of 1612 was published. This could not be  gathered from the dedication to Bacon prefixed to Strachey's MS., for  that dedication cannot be earlier that 1618.(3) I now ask leave to  discuss the evidence for an early pre-Christian belief in a primal  Creator, held by the Indian tribes from Plymouth, in New England, to  Roanoke Island, off Southern Virginia.      (1) Prim. Cult. ii. p. 342.    (2) Arber's Smith, p. cxxxiii.    (3) Hakluyt Society, Strachey, 1849, pp. xxi., xxii.      THE GOD AHONE.    An insertion by a manifest plagiary into the work of a detected liar  is not, usually, good evidence. Yet this is all the evidence, it may be  urged, which we have for the existence of a belief, in early Virginia,  as to a good Creator, named Ahone. The matter stands thus: In 1607-1609  the famed Captain John Smith endured and achieved in Virginia sufferings  and adventures. In 1608 he sent to the Council at home a MS. map and  description of the colony. In 1609 he returned to England (October). In  May, 1610, William Strachey, gent., arrived in Virginia, where he was  \"secretary of state\" to Lord De la Warr. In 1612 Strachey and Smith  were both in England. In that year Barnes of Oxford published A Map  of Virginia, with a description, etc., \"written by Captain Smith,\"  according to the title-page. There was annexed a compilation from  various sources, edited by \"W. S.,\" that is, NOT William Strachey,  but Dr. William Symonds. In the same year, 1612, or in 1611, William  Strachey wrote his Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia, at  least as far as page 124 of the Hakluyt edition of 1849.(1)      (1) For proof see p. 24. third line from foot of page, where 1612 is  indicated. Again, see p. 98, line 5, where \"last year\" is dated as  \"1610, about Christmas,\" which would put Strachey's work at this point  as actually of 1611; prior, that is, to Smith's publication. Again, p.  124, \"this last year, myself being at the Falls\" (of the James River),  \"I found in an Indian house certain clawes... which I brought away and  into England\".      If Strachey, who went out with Lord De la Warr as secretary in 1610,  returned with him (as is likely), he sailed for England on 28th March,  1611. In that case, he was in England in 1611, and the passages cited  leave it dubious whether he wrote his book in 1611, 1612, or in both  years.(1)      (1) Mr. Arber dates the MS. \"1610-1615,\" and attributes to Strachey Laws  for Virginia, 1612.      Strachey embodies in his work considerable pieces of Smith's Map of  Virginia and Description, written in 1608, and published in 1612. He  continually deserts Smith, however, adding more recent information,  reflections and references to the ancient classics, with allusions to  his own travels in the Levant. His glossary is much more extensive than  Smith's, and he inserts a native song of triumph over the English in the  original.(1) Now, when Strachey comes to the religion of the natives(2)  he gives eighteen pages (much of it verbiage) to five of Smith's.(3)  What Smith (1612) says of their chief god I quote, setting Strachey's  version (1611-1612) beside it.      (1) Strachey, pp. 79-80. He may have got the song from Kemps or  Machumps, friendly natives.    (2) Pp. 82-100.    (3) Arber, pp. 74-79.      SMITH (Published, 1612).    But their chiefe God they worship is the Diuell. Him they call Oke, and  serue him more of feare than loue. They say they have conference with  him, and fashion themselues as near to his shape as they can imagine.  In their Temples, they have his image euile favouredly carved, and then  painted, and adorned with chaines, copper, and beades; and covered with  a skin, in such manner as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#3)"],[1,"regard to Shakespeare's and to George  Eliot's testimony, that their concession to the \"importance\" of their  Juliets and Cleopatras and Portias (even with Portia as the very type  and model of the young person intelligent and presumptuous) and to that  of their Hettys and Maggies and Rosamonds and Gwendolens, suffers the  abatement that these slimnesses are, when figuring as the main props of  the theme, never suffered to be sole ministers of its appeal, but have  their inadequacy eked out with comic relief and underplots, as the  playwrights say, when not with murders and battles and the great  mutations of the world. If they are shown as \"mattering\" as much as  they could possibly pretend to, the proof of it is in a hundred other  persons, made of much stouter stuff; and each involved moreover in a  hundred relations which matter to THEM concomitantly with that one.  Cleopatra matters, beyond bounds, to Antony, but his colleagues,  his antagonists, the state of Rome and the impending battle also  prodigiously matter; Portia matters to Antonio, and to Shylock, and  to the Prince of Morocco, to the fifty aspiring princes, but for these  gentry there are other lively concerns; for Antonio, notably, there  are Shylock and Bassanio and his lost ventures and the extremity of  his predicament. This extremity indeed, by the same token, matters to  Portia--though its doing so becomes of interest all by the fact that  Portia matters to US. That she does so, at any rate, and that almost  everything comes round to it again, supports my contention as to this  fine example of the value recognised in the mere young thing. (I say  \"mere\" young thing because I guess that even Shakespeare, preoccupied  mainly though he may have been with the passions of princes, would  scarce have pretended to found the best of his appeal for her on her  high social position.) It is an example exactly of the deep difficulty  braved--the difficulty of making George Eliot's \"frail vessel,\" if not  the all-in-all for our attention, at least the clearest of the call.    Now to see deep difficulty braved is at any time, for the really  addicted artist, to feel almost even as a pang the beautiful incentive,  and to feel it verily in such sort as to wish the danger intensified.  The difficulty most worth tackling can only be for him, in these  conditions, the greatest the case permits of. So I remember feeling  here (in presence, always, that is, of the particular uncertainty of my  ground), that there would be one way better than another--oh, ever so  much better than any other!--of making it fight out its battle. The  frail vessel, that charged with George Eliot's \"treasure,\" and thereby  of such importance to those who curiously approach it, has likewise  possibilities of importance to itself, possibilities which permit of  treatment and in fact peculiarly require it from the moment they are  considered at all. There is always the escape from any close account  of the weak agent of such spells by using as a bridge for evasion, for  retreat and flight, the view of her relation to those surrounding her.  Make it predominantly a view of THEIR relation and the trick is played:  you give the general sense of her effect, and you give it, so far as the  raising on it of a superstructure goes, with the maximum of ease. Well,  I recall perfectly how little, in my now quite established connexion,  the maximum of ease appealed to me, and how I seemed to get rid of it  by an honest transposition of the weights in the two scales. \"Place the  centre of the subject in the young woman's own consciousness,\" I said to  myself, \"and you get as interesting and as beautiful a difficulty as you  could wish. Stick to THAT--for the centre; put the heaviest weight  into THAT scale, which will be so largely the scale of her relation  to herself. Make her only interested enough, at the same time, in the  things that are not herself, and this relation needn't fear to be too  limited. Place meanwhile in the other scale the lighter weight (which is  usually the one that tips the balance of interest): press least hard, in  short, on the consciousness of your heroine's satellites, especially the  male; make it an interest contributive only to the greater one. See, at  all events, what can be done in this way. What better field could there  be for a due ingenuity? The girl hovers, inextinguishable, as a charming  creature, and the job will be to translate her into the highest terms  of that formula, and as nearly as possible moreover into ALL of them. To  depend upon her and her little concerns wholly to see you through will  necessitate, remember, your really 'doing' her.\"    So far I reasoned, and it took nothing less than that technical rigour,  I now easily see, to inspire me with the right confidence for erecting  on such a plot of ground the neat and careful and proportioned pile of  bricks that arches over it and that was thus to form, constructionally  speaking, a literary monument. Such is the aspect that to-day \"The  Portrait\" wears for me: a structure reared with an \"architectural\"  competence, as Turgenieff would have said, that makes it, to the  author's own sense, the most proportioned of his productions after \"The  Ambassadors\" which was to follow it so many years later and which has,  no doubt, a superior roundness. On one thing I was determined; that,  though I should clearly have to pile brick upon brick for the creation  of an interest, I would leave no pretext for saying that anything is  out of line, scale or perspective. I would build large--in fine embossed  vaults and painted arches, as who should say, and yet never let it  appear that the chequered pavement, the ground under the reader's  feet, fails to stretch at every point to the base of the walls. That  precautionary spirit, on re-perusal of the book, is the old note that  most touches me: it testifies so, for my own ear, to the anxiety of my  provision for the reader's amusement. I felt, in view of the possible  limitations of my subject, that no such provision could be excessive,  and the development of the latter was simply the general form of that  earnest quest. And I find indeed that this is the only account I can  give myself of the evolution of the fable it is all under the head thus  named that I conceive the needful accretion as having taken place, the  right complications as having started. It was naturally of the essence  that the young woman should be herself complex; that was rudimentary--or  was at any rate the light in which Isabel Archer had originally dawned.  It went, however, but a certain way, and other lights, contending,  conflicting lights, and of as many different colours, if possible, as  the rockets, the Roman candles and Catherine-wheels of a \"pyrotechnic  display,\" would be employable to attest that she was. I had, no doubt, a  groping instinct for the right complications, since I am quite unable  to track the footsteps of those that constitute, as the case stands, the  general situation exhibited. They are there, for what they are worth,  and as numerous as might be; but my memory, I confess, is a blank as to  how and whence they came.    I seem to myself to have waked up one morning in possession of them--of  Ralph Touchett and his parents, of Madame Merle, of Gilbert Osmond and  his daughter and his sister, of Lord Warburton, Caspar Goodwood and  Miss Stackpole, the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer's  history. I recognised them, I knew them, they were the numbered pieces  of my puzzle, the concrete terms of my \"plot.\" It was as if they had  simply, by an impulse of their own, floated into my ken, and all in  response to my primary question: \"Well, what will she DO?\" Their answer  seemed to be that if I would trust them they would show me; on which,  with an urgent appeal to them to make it at least as interesting as  they could, I trusted them. They were like the group of attendants and  entertainers who come down by train when people in the country give a  party; they represented the contract for carrying the party on. That was  an excellent relation with them--a possible one even with so broken a  reed (from her slightness of cohesion) as Henrietta Stackpole. It is a  familiar truth to the novelist, at the strenuous hour, that, as certain  elements in any work are of the essence, so others are only of the  form; that as this or that character, this or that disposition of the  material, belongs to the subject directly, so to speak, so this or that  other belongs to it but indirectly--belongs intimately to the treatment.  This is a truth, however, of which he rarely gets the benefit--since it  could be assured to him, really, but by criticism based upon perception,  criticism which is too little of this world. He must not think of  benefits, moreover, I freely recognise, for that way dishonour lies:  he has, that is, but one to think of--the benefit, whatever it may be,  involved in his having cast a spell upon the simpler, the very simplest,  forms of attention. This is all he is entitled to; he is entitled to  nothing, he is bound to admit, that can come to him, from the reader, as  a result on the latter's part of any act of reflexion or discrimination.  He may ENJOY this finer tribute--that is another affair, but on  condition only of taking it as a gratuity \"thrown in,\" a mere miraculous  windfall, the fruit of a tree he may not pretend to have shaken. Against  reflexion, against discrimination, in his interest, all earth and air  conspire; wherefore it is that, as I say, he must in many a case have  schooled himself, from the first, to work but for a \"living wage.\" The  living wage is the reader's grant of the least possible quantity of  attention required for consciousness of a \"spell.\" The occasional  charming \"tip\" is an act of his intelligence over and beyond this, a  golden apple, for the writer's lap, straight from the wind-stirred"]]]
