Communications - note  This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Country data codes  see Data codes    Country map  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps  were produced from the best information available at the time of  preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name  This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional  long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local  long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the  Terminology note.    Crude oil  See entry for oil.    Currency  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic  subunit.    Currency code  This entry gives the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.    Current account balance  This entry records a country's net trade in goods and services, plus  net earnings from rents, interest, profits, and dividends, and net  transfer payments (such as pension funds and worker remittances) to and  from the rest of the world during the period specified.    Data codes  This information is presented in Appendix D:  Cross-Reference List of  Country Data Codes and Appendix E:  Cross-Reference List of  Hydrographic Data Codes.  This appendix includes the US Government  approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and  Internet codes for land entities.  The appendix also includes the  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart  and Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Geospatial-  Intelligence Agency or NGA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency  (DIA) codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet  approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-  4 standard for country data codes.    Date of information  In general, information available as of 1 January 2004, was used in the  preparation of this edition.    Death rate  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death  rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a  country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all  ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt - external  This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents  repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.    Dependency status  This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation  The US Government has diplomatic relations with 186 independent states,  including 185 of the 191 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US  has diplomatic relations with 1 independent state that is not in the UN  - Holy See.    Diplomatic representation in the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, chancery, telephone, FAX,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation from the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Disputes - international  This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving borders  or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,  geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does  not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US  Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index  This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of  family income in a country.  The index is calculated from the Lorenz  curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number  of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the  ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45  degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45  degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the  closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini  index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more  unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve  from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-  Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with  perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree  line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with  perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal  axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.    Economic aid - donor  This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations to  developing countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as  financial assistance that is concessional in character, has the main  objective to promote economic development and welfare of the less  developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private  flows.    Economic aid - recipient  This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and  statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development  Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and  from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included  in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.  Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The  entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.    Economy  This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,  and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy - overview  This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree  of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most  important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It  also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most  recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key  future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption  This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy  between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in  transmission and distribution.    Electricity - exports  This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - imports  This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - production  This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed in kilowatt-  hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted  for as loss in transmission and distribution.    Electricity - production by source  This entry states the percentage share of electricity generated from  each energy source. These are fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, and other  (solar, geothermal, and wind).    Elevation extremes  This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point.    Entities  Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. \"Independent state\" refers to a people politically  organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.  \"Dependencies\" and \"areas of special sovereignty\" refer to a broad  category of political entities that are associated in some way with an  independent state. \"Country\" names used in the table of contents or for  page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,  dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic  entities. There are a total of 271 separate geographic entities in The  World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:    INDEPENDENT STATES     192 Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and  Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, The  Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,  Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil,  Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,  Canada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, China,  Colombia, Comoros, Democratic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#3)"],[1,"mpiegne, but the  marquise was so insistent as to the necessity for further and better  advice than anything he could get away from home, that M. d'Aubray  decided to go. He made the journey in his own carriage, leaning upon his  daughter's shoulder; the behaviour of the marquise was always the same:  at last M. d'Aubray reached Paris. All had taken place as the marquise  desired; for the scene was now changed: the doctor who had witnessed the  symptoms would not be present at the death; no one could discover the  cause by studying the progress of the disorder; the thread of  investigation was snapped in two, and the two ends were now too distant  to be joined again. In spite, of every possible attention, M. d'Aubray  grew continually worse; the marquise was faithful to her mission, and  never left him for an hour. At list, after four days of agony, he died  in his daughter's arms, blessing the woman who was his murderess. Her  grief then broke forth uncontrolled. Her sobs and tears were so vehement  that her brothers' grief seemed cold beside hers. Nobody suspected a  crime, so no autopsy was held; the tomb was closed, and not the  slightest suspicion had approached her.    But the marquise had only gained half her purpose. She had now more  freedom for her love affairs, but her father's dispositions were not so  favourable as she expected: the greater part of his property, together  with his business, passed to the elder brother and to the second  brother, who was Parliamentary councillor; the position of, the marquise  was very little improved in point of fortune.    Sainte-Croix was leading a fine and joyous life. Although nobody  supposed him to be wealthy, he had a steward called Martin, three  lackeys called George, Lapierre, and Lachaussee, and besides his coach  and other carriages he kept ordinary bearers for excursions at night. As  he was young and good-looking, nobody troubled about where all these  luxuries came from. It was quite the custom in those days that a  well-set-up young gentleman should want for nothing, and Sainte-Croix  was commonly said to have found the philosopher's stone. In his life in  the world he had formed friendships with various persons, some noble,  some rich: among the latter was a man named Reich de Penautier,  receiver-general of the clergy and treasurer of the States of Languedoc,  a millionaire, and one of those men who are always successful, and who  seem able by the help of their money to arrange matters that would  appear to be in the province of God alone. This Penautier was connected  in business with a man called d'Alibert, his first clerk, who died all  of a sudden of apoplexy. The attack was known to Penautier sooner than  to his own family: then the papers about the conditions of partnership  disappeared, no one knew how, and d'Alibert's wife and child were  ruined. D'Alibert's brother-in-law, who was Sieur de la Magdelaine, felt  certain vague suspicions concerning this death, and wished to get to the  bottom of it; he accordingly began investigations, which were suddenly  brought to an end by his death.    In one way alone Fortune seemed to have abandoned her favourite: Maitre  Penautier had a great desire to succeed the Sieur of Mennevillette, who  was receiver of the clergy, and this office was worth nearly 60,000  livres. Penautier knew that Mennevillette was retiring in favour of his  chief clerk, Messire Pierre Hannyvel, Sieur de Saint-Laurent, and he had  taken all the necessary, steps for buying the place over his head: the  Sieur de Saint-Laurent, with the full support of the clergy, obtained  the reversion for nothing--a thing that never happened before. Penautier  then offered him 40,000 crowns to go halves, but Saint-Laurent refused.  Their relations, however, were not broken off, and they continued to  meet. Penautier was considered such a lucky fellow that it was generally  expected he would somehow or other get some day the post he coveted so  highly. People who had no faith in the mysteries of alchemy declared  that Sainte-Croix and Penautier did business together.    Now, when the period for mourning was over, the relations of the  marquise and Sainte-Croix were as open and public as before: the two  brothers d'Aubray expostulated with her by the medium of an older sister  who was in a Carmelite nunnery, and the marquise perceived that her  father had on his death bequeathed the care and supervision of her to  her brothers. Thus her first crime had been all but in vain: she had  wanted to get rid of her father's rebukes and to gain his fortune; as a  fact the fortune was diminished by reason of her elder brothers, and she  had scarcely enough to pay her debts; while the rebukes were renewed  from the mouths of her brothers, one of whom, being civil lieutenant,  had the power to separate her again from her lover. This must be  prevented. Lachaussee left the service of Sainte-Croix, and by a  contrivance of the marquise was installed three months later as servant  of the elder brother, who lived with the civil lieutenant. The poison to  be used on this occasion was not so swift as the one taken by M.  d'Aubray so violent a death happening so soon in the same family might  arouse suspicion. Experiments were tried once more, not on animals--for  their different organisation might put the poisoner's science in the  wrong--but as before upon human subjects; as before, a 'corpus vili' was  taken. The marquise had the reputation of a pious and charitable lady;  seldom did she fail to relieve the poor who appealed: more than this,  she took part in the work of those devoted women who are pledged to the  service of the sick, and she walked the hospitals and presented wine and  other medicaments. No one was surprised when she appeared in her  ordinary way at l'Hotel-Dieu. This time she brought biscuits and cakes  for the convalescent patients, her gifts being, as usual, gratefully  received. A month later she paid another visit, and inquired after  certain patients in whom she was particularly interested: since the last  time she came they had suffered a relapse--the malady had changed in  nature, and had shown graver symptoms. It was a kind of deadly fatigue,  killing them by a slows strange decay. She asked questions of the  doctors but could learn nothing: this malady was unknown to them, and  defied all the resources of their art. A fortnight later she returned.  Some of the sick people were dead, others still alive, but desperately  ill; living skeletons, all that seemed left of them was sight, speech,  and breath. At the end of two months they were all dead, and the  physicians had been as much at a loss over the post-mortems as over the  treatment of the dying.    Experiments of this kind were reassuring; so Lachaussee had orders to  carry out his instructions. One day the civil lieutenant rang his bell,  and Lachaussee, who served the councillor, as we said before, came up  for orders. He found the lieutenant at work with his secretary, Couste  what he wanted was a glass of wine and water. In a moment Lachaussee  brought it in. The lieutenant put the glass to his lips, but at the  first sip pushed it away, crying, \"What have you brought, you wretch? I  believe you want to poison me.\" Then handing the glass to his secretary,  he added, \"Look at it, Couste: what is this stuff?\" The secretary put a  few drops into a coffee-spoon, lifting it to his nose and then to his  mouth: the drink had the smell and taste of vitriol. Meanwhile  Lachaussee went up to the secretary and told him he knew what it must  be: one of the councillor's valets had taken a dose of medicine that  morning, and without noticing he must have brought the very glass his  companion had used. Saying this, he took the glass from the secretary's  hand, put it to his lips, pretending to taste it himself, and then said  he had no doubt it was so, for he recognised the smell. He then threw  the wine into the fireplace.    As the lieutenant had not drunk enough to be upset by it, he soon forgot  this incident and the suspicions that had been aroused at the moment in  his mind. Sainte-Croix and the marquise perceived that they had made a  false step, and at the risk of involving several people in their plan  for vengeance, they decided on the employment of other means. Three  months passed without any favourable occasion presenting itself; at  last, on one of the early days of April 1670, the lieutenant took his  brother to his country place, Villequoy, in Beauce, to spend the Easter  vacation. Lachaussee was with his master, and received his instructions  at the moment of departure.    The day after they arrived in the country there was a pigeon-pie for  dinner: seven persons who had eaten it felt indisposed after the meal,  and the three who had not taken it were perfectly well. Those on whom  the poisonous substance had chiefly acted were the lieutenant, the  councillor, and the commandant of the watch. He may have eaten more, or  possibly the poison he had tasted on the former occasion helped, but at  any rate the lieutenant was the first to be attacked with vomiting two  hours later, the councillor showed the same symptoms; the commandant and  the others were a prey for several hours to frightful internal pains;  but from the beginning their condition was not nearly so grave as that  of the two brothers. This time again, as usual, the help of doctors was  useless. On the 12th of April, five days after they had been poisoned,  the lieutenant and his brother returned to Paris so changed that anyone  would have thought they had both suffered a long and cruel illness.  Madame de Brinvilliers was in the country at the time, and did not come  back during the whole time that her brothers were ill. From the very  first consultation in the lieutenant's case the doctors entertained no  hope. The symptoms were the same as those to which his father had  succumbed, and they supposed it was an "]]]
