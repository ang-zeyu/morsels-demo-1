Events were not slow to prove that  this accusation was false.    As we have stated, Mary was much attached to the Prior of St. Andrews, a  son of James V and of a noble descendant of the Earls of Mar, who had  been very handsome in her youth, and who, in spite of the well-known  love for her of James V, and the child who had resulted, had none the  less wedded Lord Douglas of Lochleven, by whom she had had two other  sons, the elder named William and the younger George, who were thus  half-brothers of the regent. Now, scarcely had she reascended the throne  than Mary had restored to the Prior of St. Andrews the title of Earl of  Mar, that of his maternal ancestors, and as that of the Earl of Murray  had lapsed since the death of the famous Thomas Randolph, Mary, in her  sisterly friendship for James Stuart, hastened to add, this title to  those which she had already bestowed upon him.    But here difficulties and complications arose; for the new Earl of  Murray, with his character, was not a man to content himself with a  barren title, while the estates which were crown property since the  extinction of the male branch of the old earls, had been gradually  encroached upon by powerful neighbours, among whom was the famous Earl  of Huntly, whom we have already mentioned: the result was that, as the  queen judged that in this quarter her orders would probably encounter  opposition, under pretext of visiting her possessions in the north, she  placed herself at the head of a small army, commanded by her brother,  the Earl of Mar and Murray.    The Earl of Huntly was the less duped by the apparent pretext of this  expedition, in that his son, John Cordon, for some abuse of his powers,  had just been condemned to a temporary imprisonment. He,  notwithstanding, made every possible submission to the queen, sending  messengers in advance to invite her to rest in his castle; and following  up the messengers in person, to renew his invitation viva voce.  Unfortunately, at the very moment when he was about to join the queen,  the governor of Inverness, who was entirely devoted to him, was refusing  to allow Mary to enter this castle, which was a royal one. It is true  that Murray, aware that it does not do to hesitate in the face of such  rebellions, had already had him executed for high treason.    This new act of firmness showed Huntly that the young queen was not  disposed to allow the Scottish lords a resumption of the almost  sovereign power humbled by her father; so that, in spite of the  extremely kind reception she accorded him, as he learned while in camp  that his son, having escaped from prison, had just put himself at the  head of his vassals, he was afraid that he should be thought, as  doubtless he was, a party to the rising, and he set out the same night  to assume command of his troops, his mind made up, as Mary only had with  her seven to eight thousand men, to risk a battle, giving out, however,  as Buccleuch had done in his attempt to snatch James V from the hands of  the Douglases, that it was not at the queen he was aiming, but solely at  the regent, who kept her under his tutelage and perverted her good  intentions.    Murray, who knew that often the entire peace of a reign depends on the  firmness one displays at its beginning, immediately summoned all the  northern barons whose estates bordered on his, to march against Huntly.  All obeyed, for the house of Cordon was already so powerful that each  feared it might become still more so; but, however, it was clear that if  there was hatred for the subject there was no great affection for the  queen, and that the greater number came without fixed intentions and  with the idea of being led by circumstances.    The two armies encountered near Aberdeen. Murray at once posted the  troops he had brought from Edinburgh, and of which he was sure, on the  top of rising ground, and drew up in tiers on the hill slope all his  northern allies. Huntly advanced resolutely upon them, and attacked his  neighbours the Highlanders, who after a short resistance retired in  disorder. His men immediately threw away their lances, and, drawing  their swords, crying, \"Cordon, Cordon!\" pursued the fugitives, and  believed they had already gained the battle, when they suddenly ran  right against the main body of Murray's army, which remained motionless  as a rampart of iron, and which, with its long lances, had the advantage  of its adversaries, who were armed only with their claymores. It was  then the turn of the Cordons to draw back, seeing which, the northern  clans rallied and returned to the fight, each soldier having a sprig of  heather in his cap that his comrades might recognise him. This  unexpected movement determined the day: the Highlanders ran down the  hillside like a torrent, dragging along with them everyone who could  have wished to oppose their passage. Then Murray seeing that the moment  had come for changing the defeat into a rout, charged with his entire  cavalry: Huntly, who was very stout and very heavily armed, fell and was  crushed beneath the horses' feet; John Cordon, taken prisoner in his  flight, was executed at Aberdeen three days afterwards; finally, his  brother, too young to undergo the same fate at this time, was shut up in  a dungeon and executed later, the day he reached the age of sixteen.    Mary had been present at the battle, and the calm and courage she  displayed had made a lively impression on her wild defenders, who all  along the road had heard her say that she would have liked to be a man,  to pass her days on horseback, her nights under a tent, to wear a coat  of mail, a helmet, a buckler, and at her side a broadsword.    Mary made her entry into Edinburgh amid general enthusiasm; for this  expedition against the Earl of Huntly, who was a Catholic, had been very  popular among the inhabitants, who had no very clear idea of the real  motives which had caused her to undertake it: They were of the Reformed  faith, the earl was a papist, there was an enemy the less; that is all  they thought about. Now, therefore; the Scotch, amid their acclamations,  whether viva voce or by written demands, expressed the wish that their  queen, who was without issue by Francis II, should re-marry: Mary agreed  to this, and, yielding to the prudent advice of those about her, she  decided to consult upon this marriage Elizabeth, whose heir she was, in  her title of granddaughter of Henry VII, in the event of the Queen of  England's dying without posterity. Unfortunately, she had not always  acted with like circumspection; for at the death of Mary Tudor, known as  Bloody Mary, she had laid claim to the throne of Henry VIII, and,  relying on the illegitimacy of Elizabeth's birth, had with the dauphin  assumed sovereignty over Scotland, England, and Ireland, and had had  coins struck with this new title, and plate engraved with these new  armorial bearings.    Elizabeth was nine years older than Mary--that is to say, that at this  time she had not yet attained her thirtieth year; she was not merely her  rival as queen, then, but as woman. As regards education, she could  sustain comparison with advantage; for if she had less charm of mind,  she had more solidity of judgment: versed in politics, philosophy,  history; rhetoric, poetry and music, besides English, her maternal  tongue, she spoke and wrote to perfection Greek, Latin, French, Italian  and Spanish; but while Elizabeth excelled Mary on this point, in her  turn Mary was more beautiful, and above all more attractive, than her  rival. Elizabeth had, it is true, a majestic and agreeable appearance,  bright quick eyes, a dazzlingly white complexion; but she had red hair,  a large foot,--[Elizabeth bestowed a pair of her shoes on the University  of Oxford; their size would point to their being those of a man of  average stature.]--and a powerful hand, while Mary, on the contrary,  with her beautiful ashy-fair hair,--[Several historians assert that Mary  Stuart had black hair; but Brantome, who had seen it, since, as we have  said, he accompanied her to Scotland, affirms that it was fair. And, so  saying, he (the executioner) took off her headdress, in a contemptuous  manner, to display her hair already white, that while alive, however,  she feared not to show, nor yet to twist and frizz as in the days when  it was so beautiful and so fair.]--her noble open forehead, eyebrows  which could be only blamed for being so regularly arched that they  looked as if drawn by a pencil, eyes continually beaming with the  witchery of fire, a nose of perfect Grecian outline, a mouth so ruby red  and gracious that it seemed that, as a flower opens but to let its  perfume escape, so it could not open but to give passage to gentle  words, with a neck white and graceful as a swan's, hands of alabaster,  with a form like a goddess's and a foot like a child's, Mary was a  harmony in which the most ardent enthusiast for sculptured form could  have found nothing to reproach.    This was indeed Mary's great and real crime: one single imperfection in  face or figure, and she would not have died upon the scaffold. Besides,  to Elizabeth, who had never seen her, and who consequently could only  judge by hearsay, this beauty was a great cause of uneasiness and of  jealousy, which she could not even disguise, and which showed itself  unceasingly in eager questions. One day when she was chatting with James  Melville about his mission to her court, Mary's offer to be guided by  Elizabeth in her choice of a husband,--a choice which the queen of  England had seemed at first to wish to see fixed on the Earl of  Leicester,--she led the Scotch ambassador into a cabinet, where she  showed him several portraits with labels in her own handwriting: the  first was one of the Earl of Leicester. As this nobleman was precisely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#3)"],[1,"patriots you will rather praise my  resolution than seek to turn me from it.    \"The country calls once more for help, and this time the call is  addressed to me, too, for now I have courage and strength. It cast me a  great in ward struggle, believe me, to abstain when in 1813 she gave her  first cry, and only the conviction held me back that thousands of others  were then fighting and conquering for Germany, while I had to live far  the peaceful calling to which I was destined. Now it is a question of  preserving our newly re-established liberty, which in so many places has  already brought in so rich a harvest. The all-powerful and merciful Lord  reserves for us this great trial, which will certainly be the last; it  is for us, therefore, to show that we are worthy of the supreme gift  which He has given us, and capable of upholding it with strength and  firmness.    \"The danger of the country has never been so great as it is now, that is  why, among the youth of Germany, the strong should support the wavering,  that all may rise together. Our brave brothers in the north are already  assembling from all parts under their banners; the State of Wurtemburg  is, proclaiming a general levy, and volunteers are coming in from every  quarter, asking to die for their country. I consider it my duty, too, to  fight for my country and for all the dear ones whom I love. If I were  not profoundly convinced of this truth, I should not communicate my  resolution to you; but my family is one that has a really German heart,  and that would consider me as a coward and an unworthy son if I did not  follow this impulse. I certainly feel the greatness of the sacrifice; it  costs me something, believe me, to leave my beautiful studies and go to  put myself under the orders of vulgar, uneducated people, but this only  increases my courage in going to secure the liberty of my brothers;  moreover, when once that liberty is secured, if God deigns to allow, I  will return to carry them His word.    \"I take leave, therefore, for a time of you, my most worthy parents, of  my brothers, my sisters, and all who are dear to me. As, after mature  deliberation, it seems the most suitable thing for me to serve with the  Bavarians. I shall get myself enrolled, for as long as the war may last,  with a company of that nation. Farewell, then; live happily; far away  from you as I shall be, I shall follow your pious exhortations. In this  new track I shall still I hope, remain pure before God, and I shall  always try to walk in the path that rises above the things of earth and  leads to those of heaven, and perhaps in this career the bliss of saving  some souls from their fall may be reserved for me.    \"Your dear image will always be about me; I will always have the Lord  before my eyes and in my heart, so that I may endure joyfully the pains  and fatigues of this holy war. Include me in your Prayers; God will send  you the hope of better times to help you in bearing the unhappy time in  which we now are. We cannot see one another again soon, unless we  conquer; and if we should be conquered (which God forbid!), then my last  wish, which I pray you, I conjure you, to fulfil, my last and supreme  wish would be that you, my dear and deserving German relatives, should  leave an enslaved country for some other not yet under the yoke.    \"But why should we thus sadden one another's hearts? Is not our cause  just and holy, and is not God just and holy? How then should we not be  victors? You see that sometimes I doubt, so, in your letters, which I am  impatiently expecting, have pity on me and do not alarm my soul, far in  any case we shall meet again in another country, and that one will  always be free and happy.    \"I am, until death, your dutiful and grateful son, \"KARL SAND.\"    These two lines of Korner's were written as a postscript:        \"Perchance above our foeman lying dead       We may behold the star of liberty.\"    With this farewell to his parents, and with Korner's poems on his lips,  Sand gave up his books, and on the 10th of May we find him in arms among  the volunteer chasseurs enrolled under the command of Major  Falkenhausen, who was at that time at Mannheim; here he found his second  brother, who had preceded him, and they underwent all their drill  together.    Though Sand was not accustomed to great bodily fatigues, he endured  those of the campaign with surprising strength, refusing all the  alleviations that his superiors tried to offer him; for he would allow  no one to outdo him in the trouble that he took for the good of the  country. On the march he invariably shared: anything that he possessed  fraternally with his comrades, helping those who were weaker than  himself to carry their burdens, and, at once priest and soldier,  sustaining them by his words when he was powerless to do anything more.    On the 18th of June, at eight o'clock in the evening, he arrived upon  the field of battle at Waterloo, On the 14th of July he entered Paris.    On the 18th of December, 1815, Karl Sand and his brother were back at  Wonsiedel, to the great joy of their family. He spent the Christmas  holidays and the end of the year with them, but his ardour for his new  vacation did not allow him to remain longer, and an the 7th of January  he reached Erlangen. Then, to make up for lost time, he resolved to  subject his day to fixed and uniform rules, and to write down every  evening what he had done since the morning. It is by the help of this  journal that we are able to follow the young enthusiast, not only in all  the actions of his life, but also in all the thoughts of his mind and  all the hesitations of his conscience. In it we find his whole self,  simple to naivete, enthusiastic to madness, gentle even to weakness  towards others, severe even to asceticism towards himself. One of his  great griefs was the expense that his education occasioned to his  parents, and every useless and costly pleasure left a remorse in his  heart. Thus, on the 9th of February 1816, he wrote:--    \"I meant to go and visit my parents. Accordingly I went to the  'Commers-haus', and there I was much amused. N. and T. began upon me  with the everlasting jokes about Wonsiedel; that went on until eleven  o'clock. But afterwards N. and T. began to torment me to go to the  wine-shop; I refused as long as I could. But as, at last, they seemed to  think that it was from contempt of them that I would not go and drink a  glass of Rhine wine with them, I did not dare resist longer.  Unfortunately, they did not stop at Braunberger; and while my glass was  still half full, N. ordered a bottle of champagne. When the first had  disappeared, T. ordered a second; then, even before this second battle  was drunk, both of them ordered a third in my name and in spite of me. I  returned home quite giddy, and threw myself on the sofa, where I slept  for about an hour, and only went to bed afterwards.    \"Thus passed this shameful day, in which I have not thought enough of my  kind and worthy parents, who are leading a poor and hard life, and in  which I suffered myself to be led away by the example of people who have  money into spending four florins--an expenditure which was useless, and  which would have kept the whole family for two days. Pardon me, my God,  pardon me, I beseech Thee, and receive the vow that I make never to fall  into the same fault again. In future I will live even more abstemiously  than I usually do, so as to repair the fatal traces in my poor cash-box  of my extravagance, and not to be obliged to ask money of my mother  before the day when she thinks of sending me some herself.\"    Then, at the very time when the poor young man reproaches himself as if  with a crime with having spent four florins, one of his cousins, a  widow, dies and leaves three orphan children. He runs immediately to  carry the first consolations to the unhappy little creatures, entreats  his mother to take charge of the youngest, and overjoyed at her answer,  thanks her thus:--    \"Far the very keen joy that you have given me by your letter, and for  the very dear tone in which your soul speaks to me, bless you, O my  mother! As I might have hoped and been sure, you have taken little  Julius, and that fills me afresh with the deepest gratitude towards you,  the rather that, in my constant trust in your goodness, I had already in  her lifetime given our good little cousin the promise that you are  fulfilling for me after her death.\"    About March, Sand, though he did not fall ill, had an indisposition that  obliged him to go and take the waters; his mother happened at the time  to be at the ironworks of Redwitz, same twelve or fifteen miles from  Wonsiedel, where the mineral springs are found. Sand established himself  there with his mother, and notwithstanding his desire to avoid  interrupting his work, the time taken up by baths, by invitations to  dinners, and even by the walks which his health required, disturbed the  regularity of his usual existence and awakened his remorse. Thus we find  these lines written in his journal for April 13th:    \"Life, without some high aim towards which all thoughts and actions  tend, is an empty desert: my day yesterday is a proof of this; I spent  it with my own people, and that, of course, was a great pleasure to me;  but how did I spend it? In continual eating, so that when I wanted to  work I could do nothing worth doing. Full of indolence and slackness, I  dragged myself into the company of two or three sets of people, and came  from them in the same state of mind as I went to them.\"    Far these expeditions Sand made use of a little chestnut horse which  belonged to his brother, and of which he was very fond. This little  horse had been bought with great difficulty; for, as we have said, the  whole family was poor. The following note, in relation to the animal,  will give an idea of Sand's simplicity of heart:--    \"19th April \"To-day I"]]]
