UNCLE REMUS INITIATES THE LITTLE BOY    One evening recently, the lady whom Uncle Remus calls \"Miss  Sally\" missed her little seven-year-old. Making search for him  through the house and through the yard, she heard the sound of  voices in the old man's cabin, and, looking through the window,  saw the child sitting by Uncle Remus. His head rested against the  old man's arm, and he was gazing with an expression of the most  intense interest into the rough, weather-beaten face, that beamed  so kindly upon him. This is what \"Miss Sally\" heard:    \"Bimeby, one day, atter Brer Fox bin doin' all dat he could fer  ter ketch Brer Rabbit, en Brer Rabbit bein doin' all he could fer  ter keep 'im fum it, Brer Fox say to hisse'f dat he'd put up a  game on Brer Rabbit, en he ain't mo'n got de wuds out'n his mouf  twel Brer Rabbit came a lopin' up de big road, lookin' des ez  plump, en ez fat, en ez sassy ez a Moggin hoss in a barley-patch.    \"'Hol' on dar, Brer Rabbit,' sez Brer Fox, sezee.    \"'I ain't got time, Brer Fox,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee, sorter  mendin' his licks.    \"'I wanter have some confab wid you, Brer Rabbit,' sez Brer Fox,  sezee.    \"'All right, Brer Fox, but you better holler fum whar you stan'.

Spose'n you drap roun' ter-morrer en  take dinner wid me. We ain't got no great doin's at our house,  but I speck de ole 'oman en de chilluns kin sorter scramble roun'  en git up sump'n fer ter stay yo' stummick.'    \"'I'm 'gree'ble, Brer Rabbit,' sez Brer Fox, sezee.    \"'Den I'll 'pen' on you,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"Nex' day, Mr. Rabbit an' Miss Rabbit got up soom, 'fo' day, en  raided on a gyarden like Miss Sally's out dar, en got some  cabbiges, en some roas'n--years, en some sparrer-grass, en dey  fix up a smashin' dinner. Bimeby one er de little Rabbits,  playin' out in de back-yard, come runnin' in hollerin', 'Oh, ma!  oh, ma! I seed Mr. Fox a comin'!' En den Brer Rabbit he tuck de  chilluns by der years en make um set down, en den him and Miss  Rabbit sorter dally roun' waitin' for Brer Fox. En dey keep on  waitin' for Brer Fox. En dey keep on waitin', but no Brer Fox  ain't come. Atter 'while Brer Rabbit goes to de do', easy like,  en peep out, en dar, stickin' fum behime de cornder, wuz de  tip-een' er Brer Fox tail. Den Brer Rabbit shot de do' en sot  down, en put his paws behime his years en begin fer ter sing:    \"'De place wharbouts you spill de grease,  Right dar you er boun' ter slide,  An' whar you fin' a bunch er ha'r,  You'll sholy fine de hide.'    \"Nex' day, Brer Fox sont word by Mr. Mink, en skuze hisse'f kaze  he wuz too sick fer ter come, en he ax Brer Rabbit fer ter come  en take dinner wid him, en Brer Rabbit say he wuz 'gree'ble.    \"Bimeby, w'en de shadders wuz at der shortes', Brer Rabbit he  sorter brush up en sa'nter down ter Brer Fox's house, en w'en he  got dar, he hear somebody groanin', en he look in de do' an dar  he see Brer Fox settin' up in a rockin'-cheer all wrop up wid  flannil, en he look mighty weak. Brer Rabbit look all roun', he  did, but he ain't see no dinner. De dish-pan wuz settin' on de  table, en close by wuz a kyarvin' knife.    \"'Look like you gwineter have chicken fer dinner, Brer Fox,' sez  Brer Rabbit, sezee.    \"'Yes, Brer Rabbit, dey er nice, en fresh, en tender, 'sez Brer  Fox, sezee.    \"Den Brer Rabbit sorter pull his mustarsh, en say: 'You ain't got  no calamus root, is you, Brer Fox?

En Brer Fox  ain't never kotch 'im yit, en w'at's mo', honey, he ain't  gwineter.\"      II. THE WONDERFUL TAR BABY STORY    \"Didn't the fox never catch the rabbit, Uncle Remus?\" asked the  little boy the next evening.    \"He come mighty nigh it, honey, sho's you born--Brer Fox did. One  day atter Brer Rabbit fool 'im wid dat calamus root, Brer Fox  went ter wuk en got 'im some tar, en mix it wid some turkentime,  en fix up a contrapshun w'at he call a Tar-Baby, en he tuck dish  yer Tar-Baby en he sot 'er in de big road, en den he lay off in  de bushes fer to see what de news wuz gwine ter be.
