As applied to the  conditions of the Franco-Dutch population in the Cape Colony it was,  in fact, a serious interference with their \"domestic concerns and  internal economy.\" And as such it produced the extraordinary protest  known to history as the \"Rebellion\" of Slaghter's Nek. There was no  question as to the facts. Booy, the Hottentot, had completed his term  of service with Frederick Bezuidenhout, the Boer, and was therefore  entitled, under the Cape law, to leave his master's farm, and to  remove his property. All this Bezuidenhout admitted; but when it came  to a question of yielding obedience to the magistrate's order, the  Boer said \"No.\" In the words of Pringle, \"He boldly declared that he  considered this interference between him (a free burgher) and _his_  Hottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an  intolerable usurpation of tyrannical authority.\"    And the danger of allowing the Boers to pursue their  seventeenth-century dealings with the natives became rapidly greater  when the European Colonists, Dutch and English, were brought, by their  natural eastward expansion, into direct contact with the masses of  military Bantu south and east of the Drakenberg chain of  mountains--the actual dark-skinned \"natives\" of South Africa as it is  known to the people of Great Britain. The Boer frontiersman, with his  aggressive habits and ingrained contempt for a dark-skin,  disintegrated the Bantu mass before we were ready to undertake the  work of reconstruction. And therefore the local British authority soon  learnt that non-interference in the case of the Boer generally meant  the necessity of a much more serious interference at a subsequent date  with both Boer and Kafir. And so non-interference, in the admirable  spirit of the Duke of Portland's despatch, came to bear one meaning in  Downing Street and quite another in Capetown.    [Sidenote: D'Urban's policy.]    The earliest of the three crucial \"divergences of opinion,\" to which  collectively the history of our South African administration owes its  sombre hue, was that which led to the reversal of Sir Benjamin  D'Urban's frontier policy by Charles Grant (afterwards Lord Glenelg)  at the end of the year 1835. The circumstances were these. On  Christmas Day, 1834, the Kafirs (without any declaration of war,  needless to say) invaded the Cape Colony, murdering the settlers in  the isolated farms, burning their homesteads, and driving off their  cattle. After a six months' campaign, in which the Dutch and British  settlers fought by the side of the regular troops, a treaty was made  with the Kafir chiefs which, in the opinion of D'Urban and his local  advisers, would render the eastern frontier of the Colony secure from  further inroads. The Kafirs were to retire to the line of the Kei  River, thus surrendering part of their territory to the European  settlers who had suffered most severely from the invasion; while a  belt of loyal Kafirs, supported by a chain of forts, was to be  interposed between the defeated tribes and the colonial farmsteads. In  addition to these measures, D'Urban proposed to compensate the  settlers for the enormous losses[1] which they had incurred; since, as  a contemporary and not unfriendly writer[2] puts it, the British  Government had exposed them for fourteen years to Kafir depredations,  rather than acknowledge the existence of a state of affairs that must  plainly have compelled it to make active exertions for their  protection.             [Footnote 1: The official returns showed that 456 farm-houses           had been wholly, and 350 partially, destroyed; and that 60           waggons, 5,715 horses, 111,930 head of horned cattle, and           161,930 sheep had been carried off by the Kafirs. And this           apart from the remuneration claimed by the settlers for           services in the field, and commandeered cattle and supplies.]             [Footnote 2: Cloete. See note, p. 16.]    The view of the home authority was very different. In the opinion of  His Majesty's ministers at Downing Street the Kafir invasion was the  result of a long series of unjustifiable encroachments on the part of  the European settlers. D'Urban was instructed, therefore, to reinstate  the Kafirs in the districts from which they had retired under the  treaty of September, 1835, and to cancel all grants of land beyond the  Fish River--the original eastern boundary of the Colony--which the  Colonial Government had made to its European subjects from 1817  onwards; while, as for compensation, any indemnity was altogether out  of the question, since the colonists had only themselves to thank for  the enmity of the natives--if, indeed, they had not deliberately  provoked the war with a view to the acquisition of fresh territory.    The divergence between these two opinions is sufficiently well marked.  To trace the precise agencies through which two diametrically opposed  views were evolved on this occasion from the same groundwork of facts  would be too lengthy a business; but, by way of comment, we may recall  two statements, each significant and authentic. Cloete, writing while  the events in question were still fresh in his mind, says of Lord  Glenelg's despatch: \"A communication more cruel, unjust, and insulting  to the feelings not only of Sir Benjamin D'Urban ... but of the  inhabitants ... could hardly have been penned by a declared enemy of  the country and its Governor.\" And Sir George Napier, by whom D'Urban  was superseded, stated in evidence given before the House of Commons:  \"My own experience, and what I saw with my own eyes, have confirmed me  that I was wrong and Sir Benjamin D'Urban was perfectly right; that if  he meant to keep Kafirland under British rule, the only way of doing  so was by having a line of forts, and maintaining troops in them.\"    [Sidenote: The Great Trek.]    This settlement of a South African question upon a basis of British,  or rather non-South African, ideas was followed by events as notorious  as they were disastrous. It must be remembered that in 1819-20 the  first and only effort to introduce a considerable British population  into South Africa had been successfully carried out when the \"Albany\"  settlers, to the number of some five thousand, were established in  this and other districts upon the eastern border of the Cape Colony.  The colonial farmers who suffered from the Kafir invasion of 1834-5  were not exclusively Boers. Among them there were many members of the  new British population, and the divergence of opinion between D'Urban  and Lord Glenelg was all the more significant, since in this case the  British settlers were in agreement with the Boers. It was no longer  merely a divergence of views as between the local and the home  authority, but as between the British in Britain and the British in  South Africa. It must also be remembered that, in the same year as the  Kafir invasion, a social revolution--the emancipation of slaves--had  been accomplished in the Cape Colony by an Act of the British  Parliament, in comparison with which the nationalisation of the  railways or of the mines in England would seem a comparatively  trifling disturbance of the system of private property to the  Englishman of to-day. The reversal of D'Urban's arrangements for the  safety of the eastern frontier was not only bad in itself, but it came  at a bad time. Whether the secession of the Emigrant Farmers would in  any case have taken place as the result of the emancipation of slaves  is a matter which cannot now be decided. But, however this may be, the  fact remains that two men so well qualified to give an opinion on the  subject as Judge Cloete and Sir John Robinson, the first Prime  Minister of Natal, unhesitatingly ascribe the determining influence  which drove the Boers to seek a home beyond the jurisdiction of the  British Government to the sense of injustice created by the measures  dictated by Lord Glenelg, and by the whole spirit of his despatch.[3]  And this judgment is supported by the fact that the wealthier Dutch of  the Western Province were much more seriously affected by the  emancipation of slaves than the \"Boers\" of the eastern districts of  the Colony; yet it was these latter, of course, who provided the bulk  of the emigrants who crossed the Orange River in the years of the  Great Trek (1835-8) We shall not therefore be drawing an extravagantly  improbable conclusion, if we decide that the movement which divided  European South Africa was due to a well-ascertained divergence of  opinion between the home and local authorities--both British.             [Footnote 3: For the benefit of those who may desire to read           the passages in which these opinions are expressed, I append           the references. Cloete's opinion is to be found in his \"Five           Lectures on the Emigration of the Dutch Farmers,\" delivered           before the Natal Society and published at Capetown in 1856. A           reprint of this work was published by Mr. Murray in 1899. Sir           John Robinson's opinion, which endorses the views of Mrs.           Anna Elizabeth Steenekamp as expressed in _The Cape Monthly           Magazine_ for September, 1876, is to be found at pp. 46, 47           of his \"A Lifetime in South Africa\" (Smith, Elder, 1900).]    [Sidenote: The birth of the republic.]    [Sidenote: Sir George Grey.]    The results of this secession of something like one-fourth of the  Franco-Dutch population are common knowledge. Out of the scattered  settlements founded by the Emigrant Farmers beyond the borders of the  Colony were created, in 1852 (Sand River Convention) and 1854  (Bloemfontein Convention), the two Boer Republics, which half a century  later withstood for two years and eight months the whole available  military force of the British Empire."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#3)"],[1,"Frogmore, 425--dog found      swimming across the Channel, 425--dog finds its way back from      Ireland to Liverpool, 425--three hounds escape from their kennel      in Ireland and return to Leicestershire, 426--bitch after losing      her eye continues to follow the fox, 427--three hounds hunt a fox      alone for seven hours, 428--pack of hounds hunt a fox for eight      hours, 428--a hound follows a fox for thirty hours, 429--foxhound      follows with her new-born pup in mouth, 429--hounds follow a fox      for four days, 430--fox leaps a precipice of sixty yards and is      followed by the hounds, 433--foxhounds refuse to eat a bag-fox,      435.

[Illustration: SPANIEL AND NEWFOUNDLAND DOGS.]      A French writer has boldly affirmed, that with the exception of women  there is nothing on earth so agreeable, or so necessary to the comfort  of man, as the dog. This assertion may readily be disputed, but still  it will be allowed that man, deprived of the companionship and  services of the dog, would be a solitary and, in many respects, a  helpless being. Let us look at the shepherd, as the evening closes in  and his flock is dispersed over the almost inaccessible heights of  mountains; they are speedily collected by his indefatigable dog--nor  do his services end here: he guards either the flock or his master's  cottage by night, and a slight caress, and the coarsest food, satisfy  him for all his trouble. The dog performs the services of a horse in  the more northern regions; while in Cuba and some other hot countries,  he has been the scourge and terror of the runaway negroes. In the  destruction of wild beasts, or the less dangerous stag, or in  attacking the bull, the dog has proved himself to possess pre-eminent  courage. In many instances he has died in the defence of his master.  He has saved him from drowning, warned him of approaching danger,  served him faithfully in poverty and distress, and if deprived of  sight has gently led him about. When spoken to, he tries to hold  conversation with him by the movement of his tail or the expression of  his eyes. If his master wants amusement in the field or wood, he is  delighted to have an opportunity of procuring it for him; if he finds  himself in solitude, his dog will be a cheerful and agreeable  companion, and maybe, when death comes, the last to forsake the grave  of his beloved master.    There are a thousand little facts connected with dogs, which many, who  do not love them as much as I do, may not have observed, but which  all tend to develope their character. For instance, every one knows  the fondness of dogs for warmth, and that they never appear more  contented than when reposing on the rug before a good fire. If,  however, I quit the room, my dog leaves his warm berth, and places  himself at the door, where he can the better hear my footsteps, and be  ready to greet me when I re-enter. If I am preparing to take a walk,  my dog is instantly aware of my intention. He frisks and jumps about,  and is all eagerness to accompany me. If I am thoughtful or  melancholy, he appears to sympathise with me; and, on the contrary,  when I am disposed to be merry, he shows by his manner that he  rejoices with me. I have often watched the effect which a change in my  countenance would produce. If I frown or look severe, but without  saying a word or uttering a sound, the effect is instantly seen by the  ears dropping, and the eyes showing unhappiness, together with a  doubtful movement of the tail. If I afterwards smile and look pleased,  the tail wags joyously, the eyes are filled with delight, and the ears  even are expressive of happiness. Before a dog, however, arrives at  this knowledge of the human countenance, he must be the companion of  your walks, repose at your feet, and receive his food from your hands:  treated in this manner, the attachment of the dog is unbounded; he  becomes fond, intelligent, and grateful. Whenever Stanislas, the  unfortunate King of Poland, wrote to his daughter, he always  concluded his letter with these words--\"Tristan, my companion in  misfortune, licks your feet:\" thus showing that he had still one  friend who stuck to him in his adversity. Such is the animal whose  propensities, instincts, and habits, I propose to illustrate by  various anecdotes.    The propensities of the dog, and some of them are most extraordinary,  appear to be independent of that instinct which Paley calls, \"a  propensity previous to experience, and independent of instruction.\"  Some of these are hereditary, or derived from the habits of the  parents, and are suited to the purposes to which each breed has long  been and is still applied. In fact, their organs have a fitness or  unfitness for certain functions without education;--for instance, a  very young puppy of the St. Bernard breed of dogs, when taken on snow  for the first time, will begin to scratch it with considerable  eagerness. I have seen a young pointer of three or four weeks old  stand steadily on first seeing poultry, and a well-bred terrier puppy  will show a great deal of ferocity at the sight of a rat or mouse.    Sir John Sebright, perhaps the best authority that can be quoted on  this subject, says that he had a puppy of the wild breed of Australia;  that the mother was with young when caught, and the puppy was born in  the ship that brought her over. This animal was so like a wolf, not  only in its appearance, but in all its habits, that Sir John at first  doubted if it really were a dog, but this was afterwards proved by  experiment.    Of all the propensities of the brute creation, the well-known  attachment of the dog to man is the most remarkable, arising probably  from his having been for so many years his constant companion, and the  object of his care. That this propensity is not instinctive is proved,  by its not having existed, even in the slightest degree, in the  Australian dog.    Sir John Sebright kept this animal for about a year, almost always in  his room. He fed him himself, and took every means that he could think  of to reclaim him, but with no effect. He was insensible to caresses,  and never appeared to distinguish Sir John from any other person. The  dog would never follow him, even from one room to another; nor would  he come when called, unless tempted by the offer of food. Wolves and  foxes have shown much more sociability than he did. He appeared to be  in good spirits, but always kept aloof from the other dogs. He was  what would be called tame for an animal in a menagerie; that is, he  was not shy, but would allow strangers to handle him, and never  attempted to bite. If he were led near sheep or poultry, he became  quite furious from his desire to attack them.    Here, then, we see that the propensities that are the most marked, and  the most constant in every breed of domestic dogs, are not to be found  in animals of the same species in their natural state, or even in  their young, although subjected to the same treatment from the moment  of their birth.    Notwithstanding the above-mentioned fact, we may, I think, consider  the domestic dog as an animal _per se_; that is, that it neither owes  its origin to the fox nor wolf, but is sprung from the wild dog. In  giving this opinion, I am aware that some naturalists have endeavoured  to trace the origin of the dog from the fox; while others, and some of  the most eminent ones, are of opinion that it sprung from the wolf. I  shall be able to show that the former is out of the question. The  wolf, perhaps, has some claim to be considered as the parent animal,  and that he is susceptible of as strong attachment as the dog is  proved by the following anecdote, related by Cuvier.    He informs us, that a young wolf was brought up as a dog, became  familiar with every person whom he was in the habit of seeing, and in  particular, followed his master everywhere, evincing evident chagrin  at his absence, obeying his voice, and showing a degree of submission  scarcely differing in any respect from that of the domesticated dog.  His master, being obliged to be absent for a time, presented his pet  to the Menagerie du Roi, where the animal, confined in a den,  continued disconsolate, and would scarcely eat his food. At length,  however, his health returned, he became attached to his keepers, and  appeared to have forgotten all his former affection; when, after an  absence of eighteen months, his master returned. At the first word he  uttered, the wolf, who had not perceived him amongst the crowd,  recognised him, and exhibited the most lively joy. On being set at  liberty, the most affectionate caresses were lavished on his old  master, such as the most attached dog would have shown after an  absence of a few days.    A"]]]
