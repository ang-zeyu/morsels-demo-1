It has not heretofore  been possible, even with the best painted specimens of birds in the  hand, to satisfactorily identify the pretty creatures, but with BIRDS  as a companion, which may readily be consulted, the student cannot be  led into error.          THE RED BREASTED MERGANSER.      Why this duck should be called red-breasted is not at first apparent,  as at a distance the color can not be distinguished, but seen near,  the reason is plain. It is a common bird in the United States in  winter, where it is found in suitable localities in the months of May  and June. It is also a resident of the far north, breeding abundantly  in Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland, and Iceland. It is liberally  supplied with names, as Red-Breasted Goosander or Sheldrake, Garbill,  Sea Robin, etc.    There is a difference in opinion as to the nesting habits of the  Red-Breast, some authorities claiming that, like the Wood Duck, the  nest is placed in the cavity of a tree, others that it is usually  found on the ground among brushwood, surrounded with tall grasses and  at a short distance from water. Davie says that most generally it is  concealed by a projecting rock or other object, the nest being made of  leaves and mosses, lined with feathers and down, which are plucked  from the breast of the bird. The observers are all probably correct,  the bird adapting itself to the situation.    Fish is the chief diet of the Merganser, for which reason its flesh is  rank and unpalatable. The Bird's appetite is insatiable, devouring its  food in such quantities that it has frequently to disgorge several  times before it is able to rise from the water. This Duck can swallow  fishes six or seven inches in length, and will attempt to swallow  those of a larger size, choking in the effort.    The term Merganser is derived from the plan of the bird's bill, which  is furnished with saw teeth fitting into each other.    The eggs of the Red-Breasted Merganser vary from six to twelve, are  oval in shape, and are of a yellowish or reddish-drab, sometimes a  dull buffy-green.    You may have seen pictures of this Duck, which frequently figures in  dining rooms on the ornamental panels of stuffed game birds, but none  which could cause you to remember its life-like appearance. You here  see before you an actual Red-Breasted Merganser.     [Illustration: From col. J. G. Parker, Jr.                  RED-BREASTED MERGANSER.]          BIRD SONG--Continued from page 41.      with exactness, will deceive Mistress Pullet herself.    To carry the idea further, we will take the notes of some of the birds  depicted in this number of BIRDS. The Osprey, or Fish-Hawk, has been  carefully observed, and his only discovered note is a high, rapidly  repeated whistle, very plaintive. Doubtless this noise is agreeable  and intelligible to his mate, but cannot be called a song, and has no  significance to the listener.    The Vulture utters a low, hissing sound when disturbed. This is its  only note. Not so with the Bald Eagle, whose scream emulates the rage  of the tempest, and implies courage, the quality which associates him  with patriotism and freedom. In the notes of the Partridge there is a  meaning recognizable by every one. After the nesting season, when the  birds are in bevies, their notes are changed to what sportsmen term  \"scatter calls.\" Not long after a bevy has been flushed, and perhaps  widely scattered, the members of the disunited family may be heard  signaling to one another in sweet minor calls of two and three notes,  and in excitement, they utter low, twittering notes.    Of the Sora Rails, Mr. Chapman says, \"knowing their calls, you have  only to pass a May or June evening near a marsh to learn whether they  inhabit it. If there, they will greet you late in the afternoon with  a clear whistled _ker-wee_, which soon comes from dozens of invisible  birds about you, and long after night has fallen, it continues like a  springtime chorus of piping hylas. Now and again it is interrupted by  a high-voiced, rolling whinney, which, like a call of alarm, is taken  up and repeated by different birds all over the marsh.\"    Poor Red-Breasted Merganser! He has only one note, a croak. Perhaps  it was of him that Bryant was thinking when he wrote the stanzas \"To  a Water-Fowl.\"    \"The sentiment of feeling awakened by any of the aquatic fowls is  pre-eminently one of loneliness,\" says John Burroughs. \"The Wood Duck  (see July BIRDS) which you approach, starts from the pond or the  marsh, the Loon neighing down out of the April sky, the Wild Goose,  the Curlew, the Stork, the Bittern, the Sandpiper, etc., awaken quite  a different train of emotions from those awakened by the land birds.  They all have clinging to them some reminiscence and suggestion of the  sea. Their cries echo its wildness and desolation; their wings are the  shape of its billows.\"    But the Evening Grosbeak, the Kentucky Warbler, the Skylark, land  birds all, are singers. They have music in their throats and in their  souls, though of varying quality. The Grosbeak's note is described by  different observers as a shrill _cheepy tee_ and a frog-like _peep_,  while one writer remarks that the males have a single metallic cry  like the note of a trumpet, and the females a loud chattering like the  large Cherry Birds.    The Kentucky Warbler's song is entirely unlike that of any other  Warbler, and is a loud, clearly whistled performance of five, six, or  seven notes, _turdle, turdle, turdle_, resembling in tone some of the  calls of the Carolina Wren. He is so persistent in his singing,  however, that the Red-Breasted Merganser's simple croak would  sometimes be preferable to it.    But the Skylark--                  \"All the earth and air                  With thy voice is loud,                As, when night is bare                  From one lonely cloud   The moon rains out her beams and heaven is over-flowed.\"                                    --C. C. MARBLE.          THE YELLOW LEGS.      Yellow Legs, or Lesser Tell tale sometimes called Yellow-leg Snipe,  and Little Cucu, inhabits the whole of North America, nesting in the  cold temperate and subarctic districts of the northern continent,  migrating south in winter to Argentine and Chili. It is much rarer in  the western than eastern province of North America, and is only  accidental in Europe. It is one of the wading birds, its food  consisting of larvae of insects, small shell fish and the like.    The nest of the Lesser Yellow Shanks, which it is sometimes called,  is a mere depression in the ground, without any lining. Sometimes,  however, it is placed at the foot of a bush, with a scanty lining  of withered leaves. Four eggs of light drab, buffy or cream color,  sometimes of light brown, are laid, and the breast of the female is  found to be bare of feathers when engaged in rearing the young. The  Lesser Yellow legs breeds in central Ohio and Illinois, where it is  a regular summer resident, arriving about the middle of April, the  larger portion of flocks passing north early in May and returning  about the first of September to remain until the last of October.    A nest of this species of Snipe was found situated in a slight  depression at the base of a small hillock near the border of a prairie  slough near Evanston, Illinois, and was made of grass stems and  blades. The color of the eggs in this instance was a deep grayish  white, three of which were marked with spots of dark brown, and the  fourth egg with spots and well defined blotches of a considerably  lighter shade of the same.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  YELLOW LEGS.]           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  SKY LARK.]    THE SKYLARK.      This is not an American bird. I have allowed his picture to be taken  and placed here because so many of our English friends desired it.    The skylark is probably the most noted of birds in Europe. He is found  in all of the countries of Europe, but England seems to claim it. Here  it stays during the summer, and goes south in the winter.    Like our own Meadow Lark, he likes best to stay in the fields. Here  you will find it when not on the wing.    Early in the spring the Skylark begins his song, and he may be heard  for most of the year.    Sometimes he sings while on the ground, but usually it is while he is  soaring far above us.    Skylarks do not often seek the company of persons. There are some  birds, you know, that seem happy only when they are near people. Of  course, they are somewhat shy, but as a rule they prefer to be near  people. While the Skylark does not seek to be near persons, yet it is  not afraid of them.    A gentleman, while riding through the country, was surprised to see  a Skylark perch on his saddle. When he tried to touch it, the Lark  moved along on the horse's back, and finally dropped under the horse's  feet. Here it seemed to hide. The rider, looking up, saw a hawk flying  about. This explained the cause of the skylark's strange actions.    A pair of these Larks had built their nest in a meadow. When the time  came for mowing the grass, the little ones were not large enough to  leave the nest. The mother bird laid herself flat on the ground, with  her wings spread out. The father bird took one of the little ones from  the nest and placed it on the mother's back. She flew away, took the  baby bird to a safe place, and came back for another.    This time the father took his turn. In this way they carried the  little ones to a safe place before the mowers came.    Like our Meadow Lark, the Skylark builds her nest on the ground--never  in bushes or trees. Usually it is built in a hole below the surface of  the ground. It is for this reason that it is hard to find.    Then, too, the color of the nest is much like that of the ground.    Four or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26672"],[0,"Bookbinding, and the Care of Books (#3)"],[1,"at the price usually paid without materially  altering the appearance of the binding. The polished calf and  imitation crushed morocco must go, and in its place a rougher,  thicker leather must be employed. The full-gilt backs must go, the  coloured lettering panel must go, the hollow backs must go, but in the  place of these we may have the books sewn on tapes with the ends  securely fastened into split boards, and the thick leather attached  directly to the backs of the sections. (See specification III. page  307.)    Such a binding would look well and not be more expensive than the  usual library binding. It should allow the book to open flat, and if  the materials are well selected, be very durable, and specially strong  in the joints, the weak place in most bindings. The lettering on the  back may be damaged in time if the book is much used, but if so it can  easily be renewed at a fraction of the cost of rebinding, and without  injury to the book.    While the majority of books in most libraries must be bound at a small  cost, at most not exceeding a few shillings a volume, there is a large  demand for good plain bindings, and a limited, but growing, demand for  more or less decorated bindings for special books.    Any decoration but the simplest should be restricted to books bound as  well as the binder can do them. The presence of decoration should be  evidence that the binder, after doing his best with the \"forwarding,\"  has had time in which to try to make his work a beautiful, as well as  a serviceable, production.    Many books, although well bound, are better left plain, or with only a  little decoration. But occasionally there are books that the binder  can decorate as lavishly as he is able. As an instance of bindings  that cannot be over-decorated, those books which are used in important  ceremonies, such as Altar Books, may be mentioned. Such books may be  decorated with gold and colour until they seem to be covered in a  golden material. They will be but spots of gorgeousness in a great  church or cathedral, and they cannot be said to be over-decorated as  long as the decoration is good.    So, occasionally some one may have a book to which he is for some  reason greatly attached, and wishing to enshrine it, give the binder a  free hand to do his best with it. The binder may wish to make a  delicate pattern with nicely-balanced spots of ornament, leaving the  leather for the most part bare, or he may wish to cover the outside  with some close gold-tooled pattern, giving a richness of texture  hardly to be got by other means. If he decides on the latter, many  people will say that the cover is over-decorated. But as a book cover  can never be seen absolutely alone, it should not be judged as an  isolated thing covered with ornament without relief, but as a spot of  brightness and interest among its surroundings. If a room and  everything in it is covered with elaborate pattern, then anything with  a plain surface would be welcome as a relief; but in a room which is  reasonably free from ornament, a spot of rich decoration should be  welcome.    It is not contended that the only, or necessarily the best, method of  decorating book covers is by elaborate all-over gold-tooled pattern;  but it is contended that this is a legitimate method of decoration for  exceptional books, and that by its use it is possible to get a  beautiful effect well worth the trouble and expense involved.    Good leather has a beautiful surface, and may sometimes be got of a  fine colour. The binder may often wish to show this surface and  colour, and to restrict his decoration to small portions of the  cover, and this quite rightly, he aiming at, and getting, a totally  different effect than that got by all-over patterns. Both methods are  right if well done, and both methods can equally be vulgarised if  badly done.    A much debated question is, how far the decoration of a binding should  be influenced by the contents of the book? A certain appropriateness  there should be, but as a general thing, if the binder aims at making  the cover beautiful, that is the best he can do. The hints given for  designing are not intended to stop the development of the student's  own ideas, but only to encourage their development on right lines.    There should be a certain similarity of treatment between the general  get-up of a book and its binding. It is a great pity that printers and  binders have drifted so far apart; they are, or should be, working for  one end, the production of a book, and some unity of aim should be  evident in the work of the two.    The binding of manuscripts and early printed books should be strong  and simple. It should be as strong and durable as the original old  bindings, and, like them, last with reasonable care for four hundred  years or more. To this end the old bindings, with their stout sewing  cord, wooden boards, and clasps, may be taken as models.    The question is constantly asked, especially by women, if a living can  be made by setting up as bookbinders. Cheap binding can most  economically be done in large workshops, but probably the best  bindings can be done more satisfactorily by binders working alone, or  in very small workshops.    If any one intends to set up as a bookbinder, doing all the work  without help, it is necessary to charge very high prices to get any  adequate return after the working expenses have been paid. In order to  get high prices, the standard of work must be very high; and in order  to attain a high enough standard of work, a very thorough training is  necessary. It is desirable that any one hoping to make money at the  craft should have at least a year's training in a workshop where good  work is done, and after that, some time will be spent before quite  satisfactory work can be turned out rapidly enough to pay, supposing  that orders can be obtained or the books bound can be sold.    There are some successful binders who have had less than a year's  training, but they are exceptional. Those who have not been accustomed  to manual work have usually, in addition to the necessary skill, to  acquire the habit of continuous work. Bookbinding seems to offer an  opening for well-educated youths who are willing to serve an  apprenticeship in a good shop, and who have some small amount of  capital at their command.    In addition to the production of decorated bindings, there is much to  be done by specialising in certain kinds of work requiring special  knowledge. Repairing and binding early printed books and manuscripts,  or the restoration of Parish Registers and Accounts, may be suggested.                                        CHAPTER II           Entering--Books in Sheets--Folding--Collating--Pulling to                  Pieces--Refolding--Knocking out Joints                                     ENTERING    On receiving a book for binding, its title should be entered in a book  kept for that purpose, with the date of entry, and customer's name  and address, and any instructions he may have given, written out in  full underneath, leaving room below to enter the time taken on the  various operations and cost of the materials used. It is well to  number the entry, and to give a corresponding number to the book. It  should be at once collated, and any special features noted, such as  pages that need washing or mending. If the book should prove to be  imperfect, or to have any serious defect, the owner should be  communicated with, before it is pulled to pieces. This is very  important, as imperfect books that have been \"pulled\" are not  returnable to the bookseller. Should defects only be discovered after  the book has been taken to pieces, the bookbinder is liable to be  blamed for the loss of any missing leaves.                                  BOOKS IN SHEETS    The sheets of a newly printed book are arranged in piles in the  printer's warehouse, each pile being made up of repetitions of the  same sheet or \"signature.\" Plates or maps are in piles by themselves  To make a complete book one sheet is gathered from each pile,  beginning at the last sheet and working backwards to signature A. When  a book is ordered from a publisher in sheets, it is such a \"gathered\"  copy that the binder receives. Some books are printed \"double,\" that  is, the type is set up twice, two copies are printed at once at  different ends of a sheet of paper, and the sheets have to be divided  down the middle before the copies can be separated. Sometimes the  title and introduction, or perhaps only the last sheet, will be  printed in this way. Publishers usually decline to supply in sheets  fewer than two copies of such double-printed books.    If a book is received unfolded, it is generally advisable at once to  fold up the sheets and put them in their proper order, with  half-title, title, introduction, &c., and, if there are plates, to  compare them with the printed list.    Should there be in a recently published book defects of any kind, such  as soiled sheets, the publisher will usually replace them on  application, although they sometimes take a long time to do so. Such  sheets are called \"imperfections,\" and the printers usually keep a  number of \"overs\" in order to make good such imperfections as may  occur.                                      FOLDING    Books received in sheets must be folded. Folding requires care, or the  margins of different leaves will be unequal, and the lines of printing  not at right angles to the back.    Books of various sizes are known as \"folio,\" \"quarto,\" \"octavo,\"  \"duodecimo,\" &c. These names signify the number of folds, and  consequently the number of leaves the paper has been folded into.  Thus, a folio is made up of sheets of paper folded once down the  centre, forming two leaves and four pages. The sheets of a quarto have  a second fold, making four leaves and eight pages, and in an octavo  the sheet has a third fold, forming eight leaves and"]]]
