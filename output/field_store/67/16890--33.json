The pictures to which the existing fragments  belong could not have been large: the figures in our picture are but nine  inches high. A few pieces have been found which must have belonged to  larger pictures, and there is one which shows a part of a face belonging  to a figure at least three feet high; but this is very unusual.    The Assyrian paintings have a broad outline which is of a lighter color  than the rest of the picture; it is generally white or yellow. There are  very few colors used in them. This does not accord with our notions of the  dresses and stuffs of the Assyrians, for we suppose that they were rich  and varied in color--probably they had so few pigments that they could not  represent in their paintings all the colors they knew.    No one can give a very satisfactory account of Assyrian painting; but,  judging from the little of it which remains, and from the immense number  of Assyrian sculptures which exist, we may conclude that the chief aim of  Assyrian artists was to represent each object they saw with absolute  realism. The Dutch painters were remarkable for this trait and for the  patient attention which they gave to the details of their work, and for  this reason Oppert has called the Assyrians the Dutchmen of antiquity.      BABYLON.    In Babylon, in the sixth century B.C., under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,  the art of tile-painting reached a high state of perfection. The  Babylonians had no such splendid alabaster as had the Assyrians, neither  had they lime-stone; so they could not make fine sculptured slabs, such as  are found at Nineveh and in other Assyrian ruins. But the Babylonians had  a fine clay, and they learned how to use it to the best advantage. The  city of Babylon shone with richly colored tiles, and one traveller writes:  \"By the side of Assyria, her colder and severer sister of the North,  Babylon showed herself a true child of the South,--rich, glowing, careless  of the rules of taste, only desiring to awaken admiration by the dazzling  brilliance of her appearance.\"    Many of the Babylonish tiles are in regular, set patterns in rich tints;  some are simply in solid colors. These last are found in the famous  terrace-temple of Borsippe, near Babylon. We know from ancient writings  that there were decorative paintings in Babylon which represented hunting  scenes and like subjects, and, according to the prophet Ezekiel, chap.  xxiii., verse 14, there were \"men portrayed upon the wall, the images of  the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their  loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to  look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their  nativity.\" Some writers assume that this must have been a description of  tapestries; but most authorities believe them to have been glazed  tile-paintings.    A whole cargo of fragments of Babylonish tile-paintings was once collected  for the gallery of the Louvre at Paris, and, when on board a ship and  ready to be sent away, by some accident the whole was sunk. From the  descriptions of them which were written, we find that there were portions  of pictures of human faces and other parts of the body, of animals,  mountains, and forests, of water, walls, and trees.    Judging from what still remains, the art of painting was far less  important and much less advanced among the Eastern or Oriental nations  than were those of architecture and sculpture. It is very strange that  these peoples, who seem to have observed nature closely, and to have  mastered the mathematical sciences, made no steps toward the discovery of  the laws of perspective; neither did they know how to give any expression  of thought or feeling to the human face. In truth, their pictures were  a mere repetition of set figures, and were only valuable as pieces of  colored decorations for walls, adding a pleasing richness and variety by  their different tints, but almost worthless as works of art.      ANCIENT GREECE AND ITALY.    The painting of Greece and that of ancient Italy are so much the same that  it is almost impossible to speak of them separately; the art of painting  was carried from Greece to Italy by the Etruscans, and the art of ancient  Rome was simply that of Greece transplanted. If Greek artists were  employed by Romans, certainly their works were Greek; and if Romans  painted they aimed to imitate the Greeks exactly, so that Italian painting  before the time of the Christian era must be considered together with that  of Greece.    In architecture and sculpture the ancient Greeks accepted what had been  done by the Egyptians and Assyrians as a foundation, and went on to  perfect the work of the older nations through the aid of poetic and  artistic imaginations. But in painting the Greeks followed nothing that  had preceded them. They were the first to make pictures which were a  life-like reproduction of what they saw about them: they were the first to  separate painting from sculpture, and to give it such importance as would  permit it to have its own place, quite free from the influence of any  other art, and in its own way as grand and as beautiful as its sister  arts.    There are writers who trace the origin and progress of Greek painting from  the very earliest times; but I shall begin with Apollodorus, who is spoken  of as the first Greek painter worthy of fame, because he was the first  one who knew how to make his pictures appear to be real, and to follow the  rules of perspective so as to have a background from which his figures  stood out, and to shade his colors and soften his outlines. He was very  famous, and was called _skiagraphos_, which means shadow painter.    Apollodorus was an Athenian, and lived at about the close of the fifth  century B.C. Although he was a remarkable artist then, we must not fancy  that his pictures would have satisfied our idea of the beautiful--in fact,  Pliny, the historian, who saw his pictures six hundred years later, at  Pergamos, says that Apollodorus was but the gatekeeper who threw open the  gates of painting to the famous artists who lived after him.    Zeuxis was a pupil of Apollodorus, and a great artist also. He was born at  Heraclea, probably in Lower Italy. When young he led a wandering life; he  studied at Athens under Apollodorus, and settled in Ephesus. He was in the  habit of putting his pictures on exhibition, and charging an admittance  fee, just as artists do now: he called himself \"the unsurpassable,\" and  said and did many vain and foolish things. Near the end of his life he  considered his pictures as beyond any price, and so gave them away. Upon  one of his works he wrote, \"Easier to carp at than to copy.\" It is said  that he actually laughed himself to death from amusement at one of his own  pictures, which represented an old woman.    Zeuxis had a rival in the painter Parrhasius, and their names are often  associated. On one occasion they made trial of their artistic skill.  Zeuxis painted a bunch of grapes so naturally that the birds came to peck  at them. Then Parrhasius painted a hanging curtain, and when his picture  was exposed to the public Zeuxis asked him to draw aside his curtain,  fully believing it to be of cloth and concealing a picture behind it. Thus  it was judged that Parrhasius was the best artist, for he had deceived  Zeuxis, while the latter had only deceived the birds.    From these stories it appears that these artists tried to imitate objects  with great exactness. Parrhasius, too, was a vain man, and went about in  a purple robe with a gold wreath about his head and gold clasps on his  sandals; he painted his own portrait, and called it the god Hermes, or  Mercury; he wrote praises of himself in which he called himself by many  high-sounding names, for all of which he was much ridiculed by others.    However, both these artists were surpassed by Timanthes, according to the  ancient writers, who relate that he engaged in a trial of skill with  Parrhasius, and came off the victor in it. The fame of his picture of the  \"Sacrifice of Iphigenia\" was very great, and its one excellence seems to  have been in the varied expression of its faces. The descriptions of this  great work lead to the belief that this Pompeian wall-painting, from which  we give a cut, closely resembles that of Timanthes, which no longer  exists.    The story of Iphigenia says that when her father, King Agamemnon, killed  a hart which was sacred to Diana, or Artemis, that goddess becalmed his  fleet so that he could not sail to Troy. Then the seer, Calchas, advised  the king to sacrifice his daughter in order to appease the wrath of Diana.  Agamemnon consented; but it is said that the goddess was so sorry for the  maiden that she bore her away to Tauris, and made her a priestess, and  left a hart to be sacrificed instead of Iphigenia. In our cut you see  Calchas on the right; two men are bearing the maiden to her doom, while  her father stands on the left with his head veiled from sight (Fig. 4).    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--SACRIFICE OF IPHIGENIA. _From a Pompeian  wall-painting._]    Zeuxis, Parrhasius, and Timanthes belonged to the Ionian school of  painting, which flourished during the Peloponnesian war. This school was  excelled by that of Sikyon, which reached its highest prosperity between  the end of the Peloponnesian war and the death of Alexander the Great.  The chief reason why this Dorian school at Sikyon was so fine was that  here, for the first time, the pupils followed a regular course of study,  and were trained in drawing and mathematics, and taught to observe nature  with the strictest attention. The most famous master of this school was  Pausias; some of his works were carried to Rome, where they were much  admired. His picture of the garland-weaver, Glykera, gained him a great  name, and by it he earned the earliest reputation as a flower-paint"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#3)"],[1,"ctions. This done, he replaced the empty bag in his wallet,  and marched on, leaving his companions amazed at his folly. Thirty of  the pearls were recovered by the soldiers. The gems were of great size,  and perfect in every particular; and it was estimated that the six  pounds of pearls would have fetched six thousand ducats in Spain (over  twelve thousand dollars). The folly of the foot soldier gave rise to  a saying in the army, that is no doubt current in Spain to this  day,--\"There are no pearls for Juan Terron,\" which means that a fool  makes no profits.    Continuing their march, the Spaniards came to the town of Chiaha,--a  site that is now occupied by the flourishing city of Rome. De Soto  remained at Chiaha a month, sending out exploring expeditions in search  of the much-coveted gold. They found traces of the precious metal, but  nothing more. On the 1st of July, 1540, De Soto left Chiaha, going down  the valley of the Coosa. His expedition was organized by the spirit of  greed. It spread desolation wherever it went, and it ended in disaster  and despair. De Soto himself found a grave in the waters of the  Mississippi, and the survivors who made their way back home were broken  in health and spirits.    An attempt has been made to throw a halo of romance over this march  of the Spaniards through the wilderness of the New World, but there  is nothing romantic or inspiring about it. It was simply a search for  riches, in which hundreds of lives were most cruelly sacrificed, and  thousands of homes destroyed.          OGLETHORPE AND HIS GENTLE COLONY    General James Edward Oglethorpe, the founder of the Colony of Georgia,  was among the few really good and great men that history tells us of.  We need to keep a close eye on the antics of history. She places the  laurels of fame in the hands of butchers, plunderers, and adventurers,  and even assassins share her favors; so that, if we are going to enjoy  the feast that history offers us, we must not inquire too closely into  the characters of the men whom she makes heroes of. We find, when we  come to look into the matter, that but few of those who figured as the  great men of the world have been entirely unselfish; and unselfishness  is the test of a man who is really good and great. Judged by this test,  General Oglethorpe stands among the greatest men known to history.    He had served in the army with distinction, as his father had before  him. He was on the staff of the great soldier Eugene of Savoy, and  under that commander made himself conspicuous by his fidelity and  fearlessness. A story is told of him that is interesting, if not  characteristic. While serving under Eugene, he one day found himself  sitting at table with a prince of Wuertemberg. He was a beardless  youngster, and the prince thought to have some sport with him. Taking up  a glass of wine, the prince gave it a fillip, so that a little flew in  Oglethorpe's face. The young Englishman, looking straight at the prince,  and smiling, said, \"My prince, that is only a part of the joke as the  English know it: I will show you the whole of it.\" With that he threw a  glassful of wine in the prince's face. An old general who sat by laughed  dryly, and remarked, \"He did well, my prince: you began it.\"    [Illustration: Oglethorpe 028]    Born in 1689, Oglethorpe entered the English army when twenty-one years  of age. In 1714 he became captain lieutenant of the first troop of the  queen's guards. He shortly afterwards joined Eugene on the continent,  and remained with that soldier until the peace of 1718. On the death of  his brother, he succeeded to the family estate in England. In 1722 he  was elected to Parliament from Haslemere, county of Surrey, and  this borough he represented continuously for thirty-two years. His  parliamentary career was marked by wise prudence and consistency;  and his sympathies were warmly enlisted for the relief of unfortunate  soldiers, and in securing reform in the conduct of prisons. In this way  Oglethorpe became a philanthropist, and, without intending it, attracted  the attention of all England. Pope, the poet, eulogizes his \"strong  benevolence of soul.\"    In that day and time, men were imprisoned for debt in England. The  law was brutal, and those who executed it were cruel. There was no  discrimination between fraud and misfortune. The man who was unable to  pay his debts was judged to be as criminal as the man who, though able,  refused to pay. Both were thrown into the same prison, and subjected  to the same hardships. In \"Little Dorrit,\" Charles Dickens has told  something of those unfortunates who were thrown into prison for debt.    There was apparently nothing too atrocious to be sanctioned by the  commercial ambition of the English. It armed creditors with the power to  impose the most cruel burdens upon their debtors, and it sanctioned the  slave trade. Many crimes have been committed to promote the commercial  supremacy of Great Britain, and on that blind policy was based the law  which suffered innocent debtors to be deprived of their liberty and  thrown into prison.    This condition of affairs Oglethorpe set himself to reform; and while  thus engaged, he became impressed with the idea that many of the  unfortunates, guilty of no crime, and of respectable connections, might  benefit themselves, relieve England of the shame of their imprisonment,  and confirm and extend the dominion of the mother country in the New  World, by being freed from the claims of those to whom they owed money,  on condition that they would consent to become colonists in America.  To this class were to be added recruits from those who, through lack  of work and of means, were likely to be imprisoned on account of their  misfortunes. Oglethorpe was also of the opinion that men of means,  enterprise, and ambition could be enlisted in the cause; and in this he  was not mistaken.    He had no hope whatever of personal gain or private benefit. The plan  that he had conceived was entirely for the benefit of the unfortunate,  based on broad and high ideas of benevolence; and so thoroughly was this  understood, that Oglethorpe had no difficulty whatever in securing  the aid of men of wealth and influence. A charter or grant from the  government was applied for, in order that the scheme might have the  sanction and authority of the government. Accordingly a charter was  granted, and the men most prominent in the scheme of benevolence were  incorporated under the name of \"The Trustees for establishing the  Colony of Georgia in America.\" Georgia in America, was, under the terms  of the charter, a pretty large slice of America. It embraced all that  part of the continent lying between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers,  and extending westerly from the heads of these rivers in direct lines to  the South Seas; so that the original territory of Georgia extended from  ocean to ocean.    In aid of this enterprise, Oglethorpe not only contributed largely from  his private means, and solicited contributions from his wealthy friends,  but wrote a tract in which he used arguments that were practical as well  as ingenious.    On the 17th of November, 1732, all arrangements having been completed,  the \"Anne\" set sail for the Colony of Georgia, accompanied by  Oglethorpe, who furnished his own cabin, and laid in provisions not  only for himself, but for his fellow-passengers. On the 13th of January,  1733, the \"Anne\" anchored in Charleston harbor. From Charleston the  vessel sailed to Port Royal; and the colonists were soon quartered  in the barracks of Beaufort-town, which had been prepared for their  reception. Oglethorpe left the colonists at Beaufort, and, in company  with Colonel William Bull, proceeded to the Savannah River. He went up  this stream as far as Yamacraw Bluff, which he selected as the site of  the settlement he was about to make. He marked out the town, and named  it Savannah. The site was a beautiful one in Oglethorpe's day, and it is  still more beautiful now. The little settlement that the founder of the  Colony marked out has grown into a flourishing city, and art has added  its advantages to those of nature to make Savannah one of the most  beautiful cities in the United States.    Close by the site which Oglethorpe chose for his colony was an Indian  village occupied by the Yamacraws,--a small tribe, of which Tomochichi  was chief. At this point, too, was a trading post, which had been  established by a white man named John Musgrove. This man had married a  half-breed woman whose Indian name was Coosaponakesee, but who was  known as Mary Musgrove. In order to insure the friendly reception of his  little colony and its future safety, Oglethorpe went to the village and  had a talk with Tomochichi. Mary Musgrove not only acted as interpreter,  but used her influence, which was very great, in favor of her husband's  countrymen. This was fortunate, for the Indians were very uneasy when  they learned that a colony of whites was to be established near their  village, and some of them even threatened to use force to prevent it;  but Oglethorpe's friendly attitude, and Mary Musgrove's influence, at  last persuaded them to give their consent. They made an agreement to  cede the necessary land, and promised to receive the colonists in a  friendly manner. Oglethorpe returned to Beaufort when he had concluded  this treaty, and the Sunday following his return was celebrated as a day  of thanksgiving. After religious services there was a barbecue, which,  history tells us, consisted of four fat hogs, turkeys, fowls English  beef, a hogshead of punch, a hogshead of beer, and a quantity of wine.    [Illustration: Mary Musgrove 032]    On the 30th of January, 1733, the immigrants set sail from Beaufort, and  on the afternoon of the next day they arrived at Yamacraw Bluff. On the  site of the town that had already been marked off, they pitched four  tents large enough to"]]]
