The Argument    Up the street two hundred yards from the Houston House Skinny and Pete  lay hidden behind a bowlder. Three hundred yards on the other side of  the hotel Johnny and Billy were stretched out in an arroyo. Buck was  lying down now, and Hopalong, from his position in the barn belonging to  the hotel, was methodically dropping the horses of the besieged, a job  he hated as much as he hated poison. The corral was their death trap.  Red and Lanky were emitting clouds of smoke from behind the store,  immediately across the street from the barroom. A buffalo gun roared  down by the plaza and several Sharps cracked a protest from different  points. The town had awakened and the shots were dropping steadily.    Strange noises filled the air. They grew in tone and volume and then  dwindled away to nothing. The hum of the buffalo gun and the sobbing  pi-in-in-ing of the Winchesters were liberally mixed with the sharp  whines of the revolvers.    There were no windows in the hotel now. Raw furrows in the bleached wood  showed yellow, and splinters mysteriously sprang from the casings. The  panels of the door were producing cracks and the cheap door handle  flew many ways at once. An empty whisky keg on the stoop boomed out  mournfully at intervals and finally rolled down the steps with a  rumbling protest. Wisps of smoke slowly climbed up the walls and seemed  to be waving defiance to the curling wisps in the open.      Pete raised his shoulder to refill the magazine of his smoking rifle and  dropped the cartridges all over his lap. He looked sheepishly at Skinny  and began to load with his other hand.    \"Yore plum loco, yu are. Don't yu reckon they kin hit a blue shirt  at two hundred?\" Skinny cynically inquired. \"Got one that time,\" he  announced a second later.    \"I wonder who's got th' buffalo,\" grunted Pete. \"Mus' be Cowan,\" he  replied to his own question and settled himself to use his left hand.    \"Don't yu git Shorty; he's my meat,\" suggested Skinny.    \"Yu better tell Buck--he ain't got no love fer Shorty,\" replied Pete,  aiming carefully.    The panic in the corral ceased and Hopalong was now sending his regrets  against the panels of the rear door. He had cut his last initial in the  near panel and was starting a wobbly \"H\" in its neighbor. He was in a  good position. There were no windows in the rear wall, and as the door  was a very dangerous place he was not fired at.    He began to get tired of this one-sided business and crawled up on the  window ledge, dangling his feet on the outside. He occasionally sent a  bullet at a different part of the door, but amused himself by annoying  Buck.    \"Plenty hot down there?\" he pleasantly inquired, and as he received no  answer he tried again. \"Better save some of them cartridges fer some  other time, Buck.\"    Buck was sending 45-70's into the shattered window with a precision that  presaged evil to any of the defenders who were rash enough to try to  gain the other end of the room.    Hopalong bit off a chew of tobacco and drowned a green fly that was  crawling up the side of the barn. The yellow liquid streaked downward a  short distance and was eagerly sucked up by the warped boards.    A spurt of smoke leaped from the battered door and the bored Hopalong  promptly tumbled back inside. He felt of his arm, and then, delighted  at the notice taken of his artistic efforts, shot several times from  a crack on his right. \"This yer's shore gittin' like home,\" he gravely  remarked to the splinter that whizzed past his head. He shot again at  the door and it sagged outward, accompanied by the thud of a falling  body. \"Pies like mother used to make,\" he announced to the loft as he  slipped the magazine full of .45-70'S. \"An' pills like popper used to  take,\" he continued when he had lowered the level of the water in his  flask.    He rolled a cigarette and tossed the match into the air, extinguishing  it by a shot from his Colt.    \"Got any cigarettes, Hoppy?\" said a voice from below.    \"Shore,\" replied the joyous puncher, recognizing Pete; \"how'd yu git  here?\"    \"Like a cow. Busy?\"    \"None whatever. Comin' up?\"    \"Nope. Skinny wants a smoke too.\"    Hopalong handed tobacco and papers down the hole. \"So long.\"    \"So long,\" replied the daring Pete, who risked death twice for a smoke.    The hot afternoon dragged along and about three o'clock Buck held up an  empty cartridge belt to the gaze of the curious Hopalong. That observant  worthy nodded and threw a double handful of cartridges, one by one, to  the patient and unrelenting Buck, who filled his gun and piled the few  remaining ones up at his side. \"Th' lives of mice and men gang aft all  wrong,\" he remarked at random.    \"Th' son-of-a-gun's talkin' Shakespeare,\" marveled Hopalong. \"Satiate  any, Buck?\" he asked as that worthy settled down to await his chance.    \"Two,\" he replied, \"Shorty an' another. Plenty damn hot down here,\" he  complained. A spurt of alkali dust stung his face, but the hand that  made it never made another. \"Three,\" he called. \"How many, Hoppy?\"     \"One. That's four.  Wonder if th' others got any?\"    \"Pete said Skinny got one,\" replied the intent Buck.    \"Th' son-of-a-gun, he never said nothin' about it, an' me a fillin' his  ornery paws with smokin'.\" Hopalong was indignant.    \"Bet yu ten we don't git 'em afore dark,\" he announced.    \"Got yu. Go yu ten more I gits another,\" promptly responded Buck.    \"That's a shore cinch. Make her twenty.\"    \"She is.\"    \"Yu'll have to square it with Skinny, he shore wanted Shorty plum' bad,\"  Hopalong informed the unerring marksman.    \"Why didn't he say suthin' about it? Anyhow, Jimmy was my bunkie.\"    Hopalong's cigarette disintegrated and the board at his left received  a hole. He promptly disappeared and Buck laughed. He sat up in the loft  and angrily spat the soaked paper out from between his lips.    \"All that trouble fer nothin', th' white-eyed coyote,\" he muttered.  Then he crawled around to one side and fired at the center of his \"C.\"  Another shot hurtled at him and his left arm fell to his side. \"That's  funny--wonder where th' damn pirut is?\" He looked out cautiously and saw  a cloud of smoke over a knothole which was situated close up under the  eaves of the barroom; and it was being agitated. Some one was blowing at  it to make it disappear. He aimed very carefully at the knot and fired.  He heard a sound between a curse and a squawk and was not molested any  further from that point.    \"I knowed he'd git hurt,\" he explained to the bandage, torn from the  edge of his kerchief, which he carefully bound around his last wound.    Down in the arroyo Johnny was complaining.    \"This yer's a no good bunk,\" he plaintively remarked.    \"It shore ain't--but it's th' best we kin find,\" apologized Billy.    \"That's th' sixth that feller sent up there. He's a damn poor shot,\"  observed Johnny; \"must be Shorty.\"    \"Shorty kin shoot plum' good--tain't him,\" contradicted Billy.    \"Yas--with a six-shooter. He's off'n his feed with a rifle,\" explained  Johnny.    \"Yu wants to stay down from up there, yu ijit,\" warned Billy as the  disgusted Johnny crawled up the bank. He slid down again with a welt on  his neck.    \"That's somebody else now. He oughter a done better'n that,\" he said.    Billy had fired as Johnny started to slide and he smoothed his aggrieved  chum. \"He could onct, yu means.\"    \"Did yu git him?\" asked the anxious Johnny, rubbing his welt. \"Plum'  center,\" responded the business-like Billy. \"Go up agin, mebby I kin git  another,\" he suggested tentatively.    \"Mebby you kin go to blazes. I ain't no gallery,\" grinned the now  exuberant owner of the welt.    \"Who's got the buffalo?\" he inquired as the great gun roared.    \"Mus' be Cowan. He's shore all right. Sounds like a bloomin' cannon,\"  replied Billy. \"Lemme alone with yore fool questions, I'm busy,\" he  complained as his talkative partner started to ask another. \"Go an' git  me some water--I'm alkalied. An' git some .45's, mine's purty near gone.\"    Johnny crawled down the arroyo and reappeared at Hopalong's barn.    As he entered the door a handful of empty shells fell on his hat and  dropped to the floor. He shook his head and remarked, \"That mus' be that  fool Hopalong.\"    \"Yore shore right. How's business?\" inquired the festive Cassidy.    \"Purty fair. Billy's got one. How many's gone?\"    \"Buck's got three, I got two and Skinny's got one. That's six, an' Billy  is seven. They's five more,\" he replied.    \"How'd yu know?\" queried Johnny as he filled his flask at the horse  trough.    \"Because they's twelve cayuses behind the hotel. That's why.\"    \"They might git away on 'em,\" suggested the practical Johnny.    \"Can't. They's all cashed in.\"    \"Yu said that they's five left,\" ejaculated the puzzled water carrier.    \"Yah; yore a smart cuss, ain't yu?\"    Johnny grinned and then said, \"Got any smokin'?\" Hopalong looked  grieved. \"I ain't no store. Why don't yu git generous and buy some?\"    He partially filled Johnny's hand, and as he put the sadly depleted bag  away he inquired, \"Got any papers?\"    \"Nope.\"    \"Got any matches?\" he asked cynically.    \"Nope.\"    \"Kin yu smoke 'em?\" he yelled, indignantly.    \"Shore nuff,\" placidly replied the unruffled Johnny. \"Billy wants some  .45-70's.\"    Hopalong gasped. \"Don't he want my gun, too?\"    \"Nope. Got a better one. Hurry up, he'll git mad.\" Hopalong was a very  methodical person. He was the only one of his crowd to carry a second  cartridge strap. It hung over his right shoulder and rested on his  left hip. His waist belt held thirty cartridges for the revolvers. He  extracted twenty from that part of the shoulder strap hardest to get at,  the back, by simply pulling it over his shoulder and plucking out the  bullets as they came into reach.    \"That's all yu kin have. I'm Buck's ammernition jackass,\" he explained.  \"Bet yu ten we gits 'em afore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#3)"],[1,"race can claim no small share in the moulding of the  modern Briton.    The Celt, however, had his day of supremacy and passed: the Roman  crushed his power of initiative and made him helpless and dependent,  and the Teuton, whether as Saxon, Angle, Frisian, or Jute, dwelt in  his homes and ruled as slaves the former owners of the land. These  new-comers were not physically unlike the Celts whom they  dispossessed. Tall and fair, grey-eyed and sinewy, the Teuton was a  hardier, more sturdy warrior than the Celt: he had not spent centuries  of quiet settlement and imitative civilisation under the aegis of  Imperial Rome: he had not learnt to love the arts of peace and he  cultivated none but those of war; he was by choice a warrior and a  sailor, a wanderer to other lands, a plougher of the desolate places  of the \"vasty deep,\" yet withal a lover of home, who trod at times,  with bitter longing for his native land, the thorny paths of exile. To  him physical cowardice was the unforgivable sin, next to treachery to  his lord; for the loyalty of thane to his chieftain was a very deep  and abiding reality to the Anglo-Saxon warrior, and in the early poems  of our English race, love for \"his dear lord, his chieftain-friend,\"  takes the place of that love of woman which other races felt and  expressed. A quiet death bed was the worst end to a man's life, in the  Anglo-Saxon's creed; it was \"a cow's death,\" to be shunned by every  means in a man's power; while a death in fight, victor or vanquished,  was a worthy finish to a warrior's life. There was no fear of death  itself in the English hero's mind, nor of Fate; the former was the  inevitable,        \"Seeing that Death, a necessary end,      Will come when it will come,\"[10]    and the latter a goddess whose decrees must needs be obeyed with proud  submission, but not with meek acceptance. Perhaps there was little of  spiritual insight in the minds of these Angles and Saxons, little love  of beauty, little care for the amenities of life; but they had a  sturdy loyalty, an uprightness, a brave disregard of death in the  cause of duty, which we can still recognise in modern Englishmen. To  the Saxon belong the tales where                        \"The warrior kings,      In height and prowess more than human, strive      Again for glory, while the golden lyre      Is ever sounding in heroic ears      Heroic hymns.\"[11]    When the English (Anglo-Saxons, as we generally call them) had settled  down in England, had united their warring tribes, and developed a  somewhat centralised government, their whole national existence was  imperilled by the incursions of the Danes. Kindred folk to the  Anglo-Saxons were these Danes, these Vikings from Christiania Wik,  these Northmen from Norway or Iceland, whose fame went before them,  and the dread of whom inspired the petition in the old Litany of the  Church, \"From the fury of the Northmen, good Lord, deliver us!\" Their  fair hair and blue or grey eyes, their tall and muscular frames, bore  testimony to their kinship with the races they harried and plundered,  but their spirit was different from that of the conquered Teutonic  tribes. The Viking _loved_ the sea; it was his summer home, his field  of war and profit. To go \"a-summer-harrying\" was the usual employment  of the true Viking, and in the winter only could he enjoy domestic  life and the pleasures of the family circle. The rapturous fight with  the elements, in which the Northman lived and moved and had his being,  gave him a strain of ruthless cruelty unlike anything in the more  peaceful Anglo-Saxon character: his disregard of death for himself led  to a certain callousness with regard to human life, and to a certain  enjoyment in inflicting physical anguish. There was an element of Red  Indian ruthlessness in the Viking, which looms large in the story of  the years of Norse ascendancy over Western Europe. Yet there was also  a power of bold and daring action, of reckless valour, of rapid  conception and execution, which contrasted strongly with the slower  and more placid temperament of the Anglo-Saxon, and to this Danish  strain modern Englishmen probably owe the power of initiative, the  love of adventure, and the daring action which have made England the  greatest colonising nation on the earth. The Danish, Norse, or Viking  element spread far and wide in mediaeval Europe--Iceland, Normandy  (Northman's Land), the Isle of Man, the Hebrides, the east of  Ireland, the Danelagh of East Anglia, and the Cumberland dales all  show traces of the conquering Danish race; and raider after raider  came to England and stayed, until half of our island was Danish, and  even our royal family became for a time one with the royal line of  Denmark. The acceptance of Christianity by the Danes in England when  Guthrum was baptized rendered much more easy their amalgamation with  the English; but it was not so in Ireland, where the Round Towers  still stand to show (as some authorities hold) how the terrified  native Irish sheltered from the Danish fury which nearly destroyed the  whole fabric of Irish Christianity. The legends of Ireland, too, are  full of the terror of the men of \"Lochlann,\" which is generally taken  to mean Norway; and the great coast cities of Ireland--Dublin, Cork,  Waterford, Wexford, and others--were so entirely Danish that only the  decisive battle of Clontarf, in which the saintly and victorious Brian  Boru was slain, saved Ireland to Christendom and curbed the power of  the heathen invaders.    A second wave of Norse invasion swept over England at the Norman  Conquest, and for a time submerged the native English population. The  chivalrous Norman knights who followed William of Normandy's sacred  banner, whether from religious zeal or desire of plunder, were as  truly Vikings by race as were the Danes who settled in the Danelagh.  The days when Rolf (Rollo, or Rou), the Viking chief, won Normandy  were not yet so long gone by that the fierce piratical instincts of  his followers had ceased to influence their descendants: piety and  learning, feudal law and custom, had made some impression upon the  character of the Norman, but at heart he was still a Northman. The  Norman barons fought for their independence against Duke William with  all the determination of those Norse chiefs who would not acknowledge  the overlordship of Harold Fairhair, but fled to colonise Iceland when  he made himself King of Norway. The seafaring instincts which drove  the Vikings to harry other lands in like manner drove the Normans to  piratical plundering up and down the English Channel, and, when they  had settled in England, led to continual sea-fights in the Channel  between English and French, hardy Kentish and Norman, or Cornish and  Breton, sailors, with a common strain of fighting blood, and a common  love of the sea.    The Norman Conquest of England was but one instance of Norman  activity: Sicily, Italy, Constantinople, even Antioch, and the Holy  Land itself, showed in time Norman states, Norman laws, Norman  civilisation, and all alike felt the impulse of Norman energy and  inspiration. England lay ready to hand for Norman invasion--the hope  of peaceable succession to the saintly Edward the Confessor had to be  abandoned by William; the gradual permeation of sluggish England with  Norman earls, churchmen, courtiers, had been comprehended and checked  by Earl Godwin and his sons (themselves of Danish race); but there  still remained the way of open war and an appeal to religious zeal;  and this way William took. There was genius as well as statesmanship  in the idea of combining a personal claim to the throne held by Harold  the usurper with a crusading summons against the schismatic and  heretical English, who refused obedience to the true successor of St.  Peter. The success of the idea was its justification: the success of  the expedition proved the need that England had of some new leaven to  energise the sluggish temperament of her sons. The Norman Conquest not  only revived and quickened, but unified and solidified the English  nation. The tyranny of the Norman nobles, held in check at first only  by the tyranny of the Norman king, was the factor in mediaeval English  life that made for a national consciousness; it also helped the  appreciation of the heroism of revolt against tyranny which is seen in  Hereward the Wake, in Robin Hood, in William of Cloudeslee, and in  many other English hero-rebels; but it gradually led men to a  realization of their own rights as Englishmen. When all men alike felt  themselves sons of England, the days were past when Norman and Saxon  were aliens to each other, and Norman robber soon became as truly  English as Danish viking, Anglo-Saxon seafarer, or Celtic settler.  Then the full value of the Norman infusion was seen in quicker  intellectual apprehension, nimbler wit, a keener sense of reverence, a  more spiritual piety, a more refined courtesy, and a more enlightened  perception of the value of law. The materialism of the original Saxon  race was successively modified by many influences, and not least of  these was the Norman Conquest.    From the Norman Conquest onward England has welcomed men of many  nations--French, Flemings, Germans, Dutch: men brought by war, by  trade, by love of adventure, by religion; traders, refugees, exiles,  all have found in her a hospitable shelter and a second home, and all  have come to love the \"grey old mother\" that counted them among her  sons and grew to think them her own in very truth.    Geographically, also, we must recognise the admixture of races in our  islands. The farthest western borders show most strongly the type of  man whom we can imagine the Iberian to have been: Western Ireland, the  Hebrides, Central and South Wales, and Cornwall are still inhabited by  folk of Iberian descent. The blue-eyed Celt yet dwells in the  Highlands and the greater part of Wales and the"]]]
