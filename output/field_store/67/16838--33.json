(#3)"],[1,"ell, I ain't much  younger than you were, Drew Rennie, when you joined up with Captain  Castleman and rode south to join General Morgan--you and Shelly. And you  know that, too! I'll be sixteen on the fifteenth of this July. And this  time I'm goin'! Where's the General now, Drew?\"    The scout shrugged. \"Movin' fast. Your rumors probably know as much as I  do. They plant him half a dozen places at once. He might be in any one  of them or fifty miles away; that's how Morgan rides.\"    \"But you're goin' to join him, and you'll take me with you, won't you,  Drew?\"    The lightness was gone from the older boy's eyes, his mouth set in  controlled anger. \"I am not goin' to do anything of the kind, Boyd  Barrett.\" He spoke the words slowly, in an even tone, with a fraction of  pause between each. Men of the command had once or twice heard young  Rennie speak that way. Although difficult to know well, he had the  general reputation of being easy to get along with. But a few times he  had erupted into action as might a spring uncoiling from tight pressure,  and that action was usually preceded by just such quiet statements as  the one he had just made to Boyd.    Boyd, however, was never one to be defeated in a first skirmish of  wills. \"Why not?\" he demanded now.    \"Because,\" Drew offered the first argument he could think of which might  be acceptable to the other, \"I'm on scout in enemy-held territory. If  I'm taken, it's not good. I have to ride light and fast, and this is  duty I've been trained to do. So I can't afford to be hampered by a  green kid----\"    \"I can ride just as fast and hard as you can, Drew Rennie, and I have  Whirlaway for my own now. He's certainly better than that nag!\" With an  arrogant lift of the chin, Boyd indicated the roan, who had raised his  head and was chewing rather noisily, regarding the two by the tree house  with mild interest.    \"Don't underrate Shawnee.\" For an instant Drew rose to the roan's  defense and then found himself irritated at being so drawn from the main  argument. \"And I wouldn't care if you had Gray Eagle, himself, under  you, boy--I'm not taking you with me. Let us be snapped up by the  Yankees, and you'd be in bigger trouble than I would.\" He gestured to  his shirt and breeches. \"I'm in uniform; you ain't.\"    \"No blue bellies could drop on us,\" Boyd pushed. \"I know where all the  garrisons are round here--all about their patrols. I could get us  through quicker'n you can, yourself. I ain't no green kid!\"    Drew slapped the blanket down on Shawnee's back, smoothed it flat with a  palm stroke, and jerked his saddle from the platform. He could not stay  right here now that Boyd had smoked him out--maybe nowhere in the  neighborhood with this excitable boy dogging him.    The scout was driven to his second line of defense. \"What about Cousin  Merry?\" he asked as he tightened the cinch. \"Have you talked this over  with her--enlistin', I mean?\"    Boyd's lower lip protruded in a child's pout. His eyes shifted away from  Drew's direct gaze.    \"She never said No----\"    \"Did you ask her?\" Drew challenged.    \"Did you ask your grandfather when you left?\" Boyd tried a  counterattack.    This time Drew's laughter was harsh, without humor. \"You know I didn't,  and you also know why. But I didn't leave a mother!\"    He was being purposefully brutal now, for a good reason. Sheldon had  ridden away before; Boyd must not go now. In Drew's childhood, his  father's cousin, Meredith Barrett, had been the only one who had really  cared about him. His only escape from the cold bleakness of Red Springs  had been Barrett's Oak Hill. There was a big debt he owed Cousin Merry;  he could not add to it the burden of taking away her second son.    Sure, he had been only a few months older than this boy when he had run  away to war, but he had not left anyone behind who would worry about  him. And Alexander Mattock's cold discipline had tempered his grandson  into someone far more able to take hard knocks than Boyd Barrett might  be for years to come. Drew had met those knocks, thick and fast,  enduring them as the price of his freedom.    \"You were mad at your grandfather, and you ran away. Well, I ain't mad  at Mother, but I ain't goin' to sit at home with General Morgan comin'!  He needs men. They've been recruitin' for him on the quiet; you know  they have. And I've got to make up for Sheldon----\"    Drew swung around and caught Boyd's wrist in a grip tight enough to  bring a reflex backward jerk from the boy. \"That's no way to make up for  Sheldon's death-runnin' away from home to fight. Don't give me any  nonsense about goin' to kill Yankees because they killed him! When a man  goes to war ... well, he takes his chances. Shelly did at Chickamauga.  War ain't a private fight, just one man up against another--\"    But he was making no impression; he couldn't. At Boyd's age you could  not imagine death as coming to you; nor were you able to visualize the  horrors of an ill-equipped field hospital. Any more than you could  picture all the rest of it--the filth, hunger, cold, and boredom with  now and then a flash of whirling horses and men clashing on some road or  field, or the crazy stampede of other men, yelling their throats raw as  they charged into a hell of Minie balls and canister shot.    \"I'm goin' to ride with General Morgan, like Shelly did,\" Boyd repeated  doggedly, with that stubbornness which seasons ago had kept him  eternally tagging his impatient elders.    \"That's up to you.\" Suddenly Drew was tired, tired of trying to find  words to pierce to Boyd's thinking brain--if one had a thinking brain at  his age. Slinging his carbine, Drew mounted Shawnee. \"But I do know one  thing--you're not goin' with me.\"    \"Drew-Drew, just listen once....\"    Shawnee answered to the pressure of his rider's knees and leaped the  brook. Drew bowed his head to escape the lash of a low branch. There was  no going back ever, he thought bitterly, shutting his ears to Boyd's  cry. He'd been a fool to ride this way at all.          2    _Guns in the Night_      There were sounds enough in the middle of the night to tell the  initiated that a troop was on the march--creak of saddle leather, click  of shod hoof, now and then the smothered exclamation of a man shaken out  of a cavalryman's mounted doze. To Drew's trained ears all this was loud  enough to send any Union picket calling out the guard. Yet there was no  indication that the enemy ahead was alert.    Near two o'clock he made it, and the advance were walking their horses  into the fringe of Lexington--this was home-coming for a good many of  the men sagging in the saddles. Morgan's old magic was working again.  Escaping from the Ohio prison, he had managed to gather up the remnants  of a badly shattered command, weld them together, and lead them up from  Georgia to their old fighting fields--the country which they considered  rightfully theirs and in which during other years they had piled one  humiliating defeat for the blue coats on another. General Morgan could  _not_ lose in Kentucky!    And they already had one minor victory to taste sweet: Mount Sterling  had fallen into their hold as easily as it had before. Now  Lexington--with the horses they needed--friends and families waiting to  greet them.    Captain Tom Quirk's Irish brogue, unmistakable even in a half whisper,  came out of the dark: \"Pull up, boys!\"    Drew came to a halt with his flanking scout. There was a faint drum of  hoofs from behind as three horsemen caught up with the first wave of  Quirk's Scouts.    \"Taking the flag in ...\" Drew caught a snatch of sentence passed between  the leader of the newcomers and his own officer. He recognized the voice  of John Castleman, his former company commander.    \"... worth a try ...\" that was Quirk.    But when the three had cantered on into the mouth of the street the  scout captain turned his head to the waiting shadows. \"Rennie, Bruce,  Croxton ... give them cover!\"    Drew sent Shawnee on, his carbine resting ready across his saddle. The  streets were quiet enough, too quiet. These dark houses showed no signs  of life, but surely the Yankees were not so confident that they would  not have any pickets posted. And Fort Clay had its garrison....    Then that ominous silence was broken by Castleman's call: \"Bearer of  flag of truce!\"    \"... Morgan's men?\" A woman called from a window up ahead, her voice so  low pitched Drew heard only a word or two. Castleman answered her before  he gave the warning:    \"Battery down the street, boys. Take to the sidewalks!\"    A lantern bobbed along in their direction. Drew had a glimpse of a  blue-uniformed arm above it. A moment later Castleman rode back. One of  his companions swerved close-by, and Drew recognized Key Morgan, the  General's brother.    \"They say, 'No surrender.'\"    Perhaps that was what they said. But the skirmishers were now drifting  into town. Orders snapped from man to man through the dark. The crackle  of small-arms fire came sporadically, to be followed by the heavier  _boom-boom_ as cannon balls from Fort Clay ricocheted through the  streets, the Yankees being forced back into the protection of that  stronghold. Riders threaded through alleys and cross streets; lamps  flared up in house windows. There was a pounding on doors, and shouted  greetings. Fire made a splash of angry color at the depot, to be  answered with similar blazes at the warehouses.    \"Spur up those crowbaits of yours, boys!\" Quirk rounded up the scouts.  \"We're out for horses--only the best, remember that!\"    Out of the now aroused Lexington just as daylight was gray overhead,  they were on the road to Ashland. If Red Springs might have proved poor  picking, John Clay's stables did not. One sleek thoroughbred after  another was led from the stalls while Quirk fairly purred.    \"Skedaddle! Would you believe it? Here's Skedaddle, himself, just aching  to show heels to the blue bellies, ain't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23625"],[0,"The Magic Pudding (#3)"],[1,"With Spanish silver and Spanish gold,    And out of every ship I sink    I'll collar the best of food and drink.      '\"For Caribbee, or Barbaree,    Or the shores of South Amerikee    Are all the same to a Pirate bold,    Whose thoughts are fixed on Spanish gold.\"      'So one fine day I runs away      A Pirate for to be;    But I found there was never a Pirate left      On the coast of Caribbee.      'For Pirates go, but their next of kin    Are Merchant Captains, hard as sin,    And Merchant Mates as hard as nails    Aboard of every ship that sails.      'And I worked aloft and I worked below,    I worked wherever I had to go,    And the winds blew hard and the winds blew cold,    And I sez to meself as the ship she rolled,      '\"O Caribbee!

O, never go there: if the truth be told,    You'll get more kicks than Spanish gold.\"'    [Illustration]    'And that's the truth, mate,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum. 'There ain't  no pirates nowadays at sea, except western ocean First Mates, and many's  the bootin' I've had for not takin' in the slack of the topsail halyards  fast enough to suit their fancy. It's a hard life, the sea, and Sam  here'll bear me out when I say that bein' hit on the head with a  belayin' pin while tryin' to pick up the weather earing is an  experience that no man wants twice. But toon up, and a song all round.'    [Illustration]    'I shall sing you the \"Penguin Bold\",' said Sam, and, striking a  graceful attitude, he sang this song--      'To see the penguin out at sea,      And watch how he behaves,    Would prove that penguins cannot be      And never shall be slaves.    You haven't got a notion    How penguins brave the ocean      And laugh with scorn at waves.      'To see the penguin at his ease      Performing fearful larks    With stingarees of all degrees,      As well as whales and sharks;    The sight would quickly let you know    The great contempt that penguins show      For stingarees and sharks.    [Illustration]      'O see the penguin as he goes      A-turning Catherine wheels,    Without repose upon the nose      Of walruses and seals.    But bless your heart, a penguin feels    Supreme contempt for foolish seals,      While he never fails, where'er he goes,      To turn back-flaps on a walrus nose.'    'It's all very fine,' said the Puddin' gloomily, 'singing about the joys  of being penguins and pirates, but how'd you like to be a Puddin' and be  eaten all day long?'    And in a very gruff voice he sang as follows:--      'O, who would be a puddin',      A puddin' in a pot,    A puddin' which is stood on      A fire which is hot?    O sad indeed the lot    Of puddin's in a pot.      'I wouldn't be a puddin'      If I could be a bird,    If I could be a wooden      Doll, I would'n say a word.    Yes, I have often heard    It's grand to be a bird.      'But as I am a puddin',      A puddin' in a pot,    I hope you get the stomach ache      For eatin' me a lot.    I hope you get it hot,    You puddin'-eatin' lot!'    'Very well sung, Albert,' said Bill encouragingly, 'though you're a  trifle husky in your undertones, which is no doubt due to the gravy in  your innards. However, as a reward for bein' a bright little feller we  shall have a slice of you all round before turnin' in for the night.'    So they whistled up the plum-duff side of the Puddin', and had supper.  When that was done, Bill stood up and made a speech to Bunyip Bluegum.    'I am now about to put before you an important proposal,' said Bill.  'Here you are, a young intelligent feller, goin' about seein' the world  by yourself. Here is Sam an' me, two as fine fellers as ever walked,  goin' about the world with a Puddin'. My proposal to you is--Join us,  and become a member of the Noble Society of Puddin'-owners. The duties  of the Society,' went on Bill, 'are light. The members are required to  wander along the roads, indulgin' in conversation, song and story,  eatin' at regular intervals at the Puddin'. And now, what's your  answer?'    'My answer,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'is, Done with you.' And, shaking  hands warmly all round, they loudly sang--    THE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' ANTHEM      'The solemn word is plighted,      The solemn tale is told,    We swear to stand united,      Three puddin'-owners bold.      'When we with rage assemble,    Let puddin'-snatchers groan;    Let puddin'-burglars tremble,      They'll ne'er our puddin' own.      'Hurrah for puddin'-owning,      Hurrah for Friendship's hand,    The puddin'-thieves are groaning      To see our noble band.      'Hurrah, we'll stick together,      And always bear in mind    To eat our puddin' gallantly,      Whenever we're inclined.'    [Illustration]    Having given three rousing cheers, they shook hands once more and turned  in for the night. After such a busy day, walking, talking, fighting,  singing, and eating puddin', they were all asleep in a pig's whisper.          Second Slice      The Society of Puddin'-owners were up bright and early next morning, and  had the billy on and tea made before six o'clock, which is the best part  of the day, because the world has just had his face washed, and the air  smells like Pears' soap.    'Aha,' said Bill Barnacle, cutting up slices of the Puddin', 'this is  what I call grand. Here we are, after a splendid night's sleep on dry  leaves, havin' a smokin' hot slice of steak-and-kidney for breakfast  round the camp fire. What could be more delightful?'    'What indeed?' said Bunyip Bluegum sipping tea.    'Why, as I always say,' said Bill, 'if there's one thing more entrancin'  than sittin' round a camp fire in the evenin' it's sitting round a camp  fire in the mornin'. No bed and blankets and breakfast tables for Bill  Barnacle. For as I says in my \"Breakfast Ballad\"--      'If there's anythin' better than lyin' on leaves,      It's risin' from leaves at dawnin',    If there's anythin' better than sleepin' at eve,      It's wakin' up in the mawnin'.      'If there's anythin' better than camp firelight,      It's bright sunshine on wakin'.    If there's anythin' better than puddin' at night,      It's puddin' when day is breakin'.      'If there's anythin' better than singin' away      While the stars are gaily shinin',    Why, it's singin' a song at dawn of day,      On puddin' for breakfast dinin'.'    [Illustration]    There was a hearty round of applause at this song, for as Bunyip Bluegum  remarked, 'Singing at breakfast should certainly be more commonly  indulged in, as it greatly tends to enliven what is on most occasions a  somewhat dull proceeding.'    'One of the great advantages of being a professional Puddin'-owner,'  said Sam Sawnoff, 'is that songs at breakfast are always encouraged.  None of the ordinary breakfast rules, such as scowling while eating, and  saying the porridge is as stiff as glue and the eggs are as tough as  leather, are observed. Instead, songs, roars of laughter, and boisterous  jests are the order of the day. For example, this sort of thing,' added  Sam, doing a rapid back-flap and landing with a thump on Bill's head. As  Bill was unprepared for this act of boisterous humour, his face was  pushed into the Puddin' with great violence, and the gravy was splashed  in his eye.    [Illustration]    'What d'yer mean, playin' such bungfoodlin' tricks on a man at  breakfast?' roared Bill.    'What d'yer mean,' shouted the Puddin', 'playing such foodbungling  tricks on a Puddin' being breakfasted at?'    'Breakfast humour, Bill, merely breakfast humour,' said Sam hastily.    'Humour's humour,' shouted Bill, 'but puddin' in the whiskers is no  joke.'    'Whiskers in the Puddin' is worse than puddin' in the whiskers,' shouted  the Puddin', standing up in his basin.    'Observe the rules, Bill,' said Sam hurriedly. 'Boisterous humour at the  breakfast table must be greeted with roars of laughter.'    'To Jeredelum with the rules,' shouted Bill. 'Pushing a man's face into  his own breakfast is beyond rules or reason, and deserves a punch in the  gizzard.'    Seeing matters arriving at this unpromising situation, Bunyip Bluegum  interposed by saying, 'Rather than allow this happy occasion to be  marred by unseemly recriminations, let us, while admitting that our  admirable friend, Sam, may have unwittingly disturbed the composure of  our admirable friend, Bill, at the expense of our admirable Puddin's  gravy, let us, I say, by the simple act of extending the hand of  friendship, dispel in an instant these gathering clouds of disruption.  In the words of the poem--      'Then let the fist of Friendship      Be kept for Friendship's foes.    Ne'er let that hand in anger land      On Friendship's holy nose.'    These fine sentiments at once dispelled Bill's anger. He shook hands  warmly with Sam, wiped the gravy from his face, and resumed breakfast  with every appearance of hearty good humour.    The meal over, the breakfast things were put away in the bag, Sam and  Bill took Puddin' between them, and all set off along the road,  enlivening the way with song and story. Bill regaled them with portions  of the 'Ballad of the _Salt Junk Sarah_', which is one of those songs  that go on for ever. Its great advantage, as Bill remarked, was that as  it hadn't got an ending it didn't need a beginning, so you could start  it anywhere.    'As for instance,' said Bill, and he roared out--      'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_,    Rollin' home across the line,    The Bo'sun collared the Captain's hat    And threw it in the brine.    Rollin' home, rollin' home,    Rollin' home across the foam,    The Captain sat without a hat    The whole way rollin' home.'    [Illustration]    Entertaining themselves in this way as they strolled along, they were  presently arrested by shouts of 'Fire! Fire!' and a Fireman in a large  helmet came bolting down the road, pulling a fire hose behind him.    'Aha!' said Bill. 'Now we shall have the awe-inspirin' spectacle "]]]
