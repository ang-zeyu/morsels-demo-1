There  were few things which such an assembly could pertinaciously refuse to  the Sovereign; and, happily for the nation, those few things were the  very things on which James had set his heart.    One of his objects was to obtain a repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act,  which he hated, as it was natural that a tyrant should hate the most  stringent curb that ever legislation imposed on tyranny. This feeling  remained deeply fixed in his mind to the last, and appears in the  instructions which he drew up, in exile, for the guidance of his son.  [2] But the Habeas Corpus Act, though passed during the ascendency of  the Whigs, was not more dear to the Whigs than to the Tories. It is  indeed not wonderful that this great law should be highly prized by all  Englishmen without distinction of party: for it is a law which, not by  circuitous, but by direct operation, adds to the security and happiness  of every inhabitant of the realm. [3]    James had yet another design, odious to the party which had set him on  the throne and which had upheld him there. He wished to form a great  standing army. He had taken advantage of the late insurrection to make  large additions to the military force which his brother had left. The  bodies now designated as the first six regiments of dragoon guards,  the third and fourth regiments of dragoons, and the nine regiments of  infantry of the line, from the seventh to the fifteenth inclusive, had  just been raised. [4] The effect of these augmentations, and of the  recall of the garrison of Tangier, was that the number of regular troops  in England had, in a few months, been increased from six thousand to  near twenty thousand. No English King had ever, in time of peace, had  such a force at his command. Yet even with this force James was not  content. He often repeated that no confidence could be placed in the  fidelity of the train-bands, that they sympathized with all the passions  of the class to which they belonged, that, at Sedgemoor, there had been  more militia men in the rebel army than in the royal encampment, and  that, if the throne had been defended only by the array of the counties,  Monmouth would have marched in triumph from Lyme to London.    The revenue, large as it was when compared with that of former Kings,  barely sufficed to meet this new charge. A great part of the produce of  the new taxes was absorbed by the naval expenditure. At the close of the  late reign the whole cost of the army, the Tangier regiments included,  had been under three hundred thousand pounds a year. Six hundred  thousand pounds a year would not now suffice. [5] If any further  augmentation were made, it would be necessary to demand a supply  from Parliament; and it was not likely that Parliament would be in a  complying mood. The very name of standing army was hateful to the whole  nation, and to no part of the nation more hateful than to the Cavalier  gentlemen who filled the Lower House. In their minds a standing army  was inseparably associated with the Rump, with the Protector, with the  spoliation of the Church, with the purgation of the Universities, with  the abolition of the peerage, with the murder of the King, with the  sullen reign of the Saints, with cant and asceticism, with fines and  sequestrations, with the insults which Major Generals, sprung from  the dregs of the people, had offered to the oldest and most honourable  families of the kingdom. There was, moreover, scarcely a baronet or a  squire in the Parliament who did not owe part of his importance in his  own county to his rank in the militia. If that national force were  set aside, the gentry of England must lose much of their dignity and  influence. It was therefore probable that the King would find it more  difficult to obtain funds for the support of his army than even to  obtain the repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act.    But both the designs which have been mentioned were subordinate to one  great design on which the King's whole soul was bent, but which was  abhorred by those Tory gentlemen who were ready to shed their blood  for his rights, abhorred by that Church which had never, during three  generations of civil discord, wavered in fidelity to his house, abhorred  even by that army on which, in the last extremity, he must rely.    His religion was still under proscription. Many rigorous laws against  Roman Catholics appeared on the Statute Book, and had, within no long  time, been rigorously executed. The Test Act excluded from civil and  military office all who dissented from the Church of England; and, by a  subsequent Act, passed when the fictions of Oates had driven the nation  wild, it had been provided that no person should sit in either House of  Parliament without solemnly abjuring the doctrine of transubstantiation.  That the King should wish to obtain for the Church to which he belonged  a complete toleration was natural and right; nor is there any reason  to doubt that, by a little patience, prudence, and justice, such a  toleration might have been obtained.    The extreme antipathy and dread with which the English people regarded  his religion was not to be ascribed solely or chiefly to theological  animosity. That salvation might be found in the Church of Rome, nay,  that some members of that Church had been among the brightest examples  of Christian virtue, was admitted by all divines of the Anglican  communion and by the most illustrious Nonconformists. It is notorious  that the penal laws against Popery were strenuously defended by many who  thought Arianism, Quakerism, and Judaism more dangerous, in a spiritual  point of view, than Popery, and who yet showed no disposition to enact  similar laws against Arians, Quakers, or Jews.    It is easy to explain why the Roman Catholic was treated with less  indulgence than was shown to men who renounced the doctrine of the  Nicene fathers, and even to men who had not been admitted by baptism  within the Christian pale. There was among the English a strong  conviction that the Roman Catholic, where the interests of his religion  were concerned, thought himself free from all the ordinary rules of  morality, nay, that he thought it meritorious to violate those rules if,  by so doing, he could avert injury or reproach from the Church of which  he was a member.    Nor was this opinion destitute of a show of reason. It was impossible  to deny that Roman Catholic casuists of great eminence had written in  defence of equivocation, of mental reservation, of perjury, and even  of assassination. Nor, it was said, had the speculations of this  odious school of sophists been barren of results. The massacre of Saint  Bartholomew, the murder of the first William of Orange, the murder of  Henry the Third of France, the numerous conspiracies which had been  formed against the life of Elizabeth, and, above all, the gunpowder  treason, were constantly cited as instances of the close connection  between vicious theory and vicious practice. It was alleged that every  one of these crimes had been prompted or applauded by Roman Catholic  divines. The letters which Everard Digby wrote in lemon juice from the  Tower to his wife had recently been published, and were often quoted.  He was a scholar and a gentleman, upright in all ordinary dealings, and  strongly impressed with a sense of duty to God. Yet he had been deeply  concerned in the plot for blowing up King, Lords, and Commons, and had,  on the brink of eternity, declared that it was incomprehensible to him  how any Roman Catholic should think such a design sinful. The inference  popularly drawn from these things was that, however fair the general  character of a Papist might be, there was no excess of fraud or cruelty  of which he was not capable when the safety and honour of his Church  were at stake.    The extraordinary success of the fables of Oates is to be chiefly  ascribed to the prevalence of this opinion. It was to no purpose that  the accused Roman Catholic appealed to the integrity, humanity, and  loyalty which he had shown through the whole course of his life. It was  to no purpose that he called crowds of respectable witnesses, of his  own persuasion, to contradict monstrous romances invented by the most  infamous of mankind. It was to no purpose that, with the halter round  his neck, he invoked on himself the whole vengeance of the God before  whom, in a few moments, he must appear, if he had been guilty of  meditating any ill to his prince or to his Protestant fellow countrymen.  The evidence which he produced in his favour proved only how little  Popish oaths were worth. His very virtues raised a presumption of his  guilt. That he had before him death and judgment in immediate prospect  only made it more likely that he would deny what, without injury to the  holiest of causes, he could not confess. Among the unhappy men who  were convicted of the murder of Godfrey was one Protestant of no  high character, Henry Berry. It is a remarkable and well attested  circumstance, that Berry's last words did more to shake the credit of  the plot than the dying declarations of all the pious and honourable  Roman Catholics who underwent the same fate. [6]    It was not only by the ignorant populace, it was not only by zealots in  whom fanaticism had extinguished all reason and charity, that the Roman  Catholic was regarded as a man the very tenderness of whose conscience  might make him a false witness, an incendiary, or a murderer, as a man  who, where his Church was concerned, shrank from no atrocity and could  be bound by no oath. If there were in that age two persons inclined by  their judgment and by their temper to toleration, those persons were  Tillotson and Locke. Yet Tillotson, whose indulgence for various kinds  of schismatics and heretics brought on him the reproach of heterodoxy,  told the House of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#3)"],[1,"was to engage my attention.  My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was  exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and  break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I  eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and  spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.    He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,  confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to  have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in  science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance  into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,  and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample  and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man  would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some  definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the  exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters  unless he has some very good reason for doing so.    His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary  literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.  Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he  might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,  when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory  and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human  being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth  travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact  that I could hardly realize it.    \"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of  surprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"    \"To forget it!\"    \"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man's brain originally is  like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture  as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he  comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets  crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that  he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman  is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will  have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of  these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It  is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can  distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every  addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is  of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing  out the useful ones.\"    \"But the Solar System!\" I protested.    \"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say  that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a  pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"    I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something  in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I  pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw  my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which  did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he  possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own  mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was  exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.  I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran  in this way--      SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.      1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.    2.

When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.  \"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all  these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\"  I said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"    I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These  were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.  That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because  at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other  favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any  music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of  an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle  which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and  melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they  reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided  those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim  or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against  these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them  by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a  slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.    During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think  that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,  however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most  different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,  dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came  three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,  fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same  afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew  pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely  followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old  white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on  another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these  nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to  beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.  He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \"I have  to use this room as a place of business,\" he said, \"and these people  are my clients.\" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank  question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to  confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for  not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to  the subject of his own accord.    It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I  rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not  yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my  late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With  the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt  intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table  and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched  silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the  heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.    Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted to  show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic  examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a  remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was  close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched  and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch  of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts.  Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one  trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible  as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear  to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had  arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.    \"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the  possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of  one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is  known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,  the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired  by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal  to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to  those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest  difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary  problems.
