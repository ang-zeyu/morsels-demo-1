It could not be.  No, no, doctor.  You set me thinking and asking myself questions about why not, and all  that sort of rubbish.  Why, sir, for the first time since our  acquaintance began, you have been playing the tempter, and nearly won,  what with your litters and palanquins and ponies.  No, sir; it's  impossible.\"    \"I say, Mark,\" said Dean, in a loud whisper, \"didn't uncle once say that  there was hardly such a word as impossible for a man or boy with a  will?\"    \"Silence, sir!\" cried Sir James angrily.    \"I say, dad,\" said Mark, closing up to his father's chair and leaning  upon his shoulder, \"I said I wouldn't go unless you did.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" cried his father fiercely, \"and if you dare to let me hear  you utter such insubordinate words again I'll--\"    The boy leaned over to look him full in the eyes, and gazed at him  firmly, and the others saw him move his lips in a slow, deliberate way  as if he were saying something emphatically; and then he drew himself up  and seemed to intensify his gaze.    \"Well, baby,\" cried Sir James, \"what do you mean by those dumb motions?  Speak out.\"    Mark shook his head and tightened his lips, compressing them into a long  line across the bottom of his face, the curve disappearing and a couple  of dot-like dimples forming at either end.    \"What do you mean by that, sir?\" cried Sir James.  \"Tell me what you  mean?\"    The boy shook his head once more, and then the line disappeared, the  curves came back, and he silently shaped the words as before.    \"Do you want to aggravate me, sir?  Such foolery!  Speak out, sir, at  once.\"    Mark drew back, walked sharply across the room and half opened the door,  before turning to face his father again, the others gazing at him in  wonder.    \"What's come to him, doctor?\" cried Sir James.  \"Here, Mark, I command  you, sir: speak out!\"    \"If you don't come with us, father,\" said the boy, slowly and  deliberately--\"oh, Dean, I am sorry for you--there will be no  expedition, for I won't go.\"    There was a moment or two's silence, and then Sir James raged out,  \"Well, of all the daring--here, doctor, is this the result of your moral  teaching of my boys?  Now, sir, frankly, what am I to do in a case like  this?\"    The doctor was silent for a moment or two.  Then after drawing a deep  breath he turned to Sir James.    \"You want my advice, sir, as frankly as I can give it, between man and  man?\"    \"Of course I do, sir,\" snapped out Sir James.    \"Well, sir, my advice is this.  Dismiss us now.\"    \"What for--to conspire against me?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the doctor, rising; \"to give you time to calmly and  dispassionately weigh this matter over--I even go so far as to say, to  sleep on it.\"    \"No, I can decide now.  You don't want me with you.\"    It is a curious fact, but three voices at the same moment gave vent to  the same ejaculation, which blended together and formed one big round  \"O!\"    \"I should be an encumbrance upon you.\"    \"You would be a great help and counsel to me, Sir James, and of course  take all the responsibility off my shoulders.\"    \"Humph!  Yes.  Well, that's true,\" said Sir James.  \"But you, Dean--now,  sir, be honest--I want the simple truth.\"    \"I always do tell the truth, uncle,\" said the boy, rather surlily; \"at  least, I always try to.\"    \"Then let's have it out now, sir, without a shadow of a doubt.  Let  there be no trying.  Wouldn't you rather that I stayed at home?\"    \"No, uncle,\" came sharply, and almost before the question was uttered.    \"Now you, Mark,\" cried Sir James.    There was silence again for what seemed a minute, but probably was not  half.    \"Well, sir, I'm waiting.\"    There was another pause, and then as the baronet jerked himself forward  in his chair, gazing at his son fiercely as if to drag a reply from his  lips, the boy seemed to swallow something, and, as Dean afterwards said  to his cousin when talking the matter over, \"I could see it go down your  throat just as if you were a big bull calf gulping down the cud.\"    \"I can't help it, father; something seems to make me say it: I won't go  unless you come too.\"    Sir James sank back in his chair, fixing his eyes first upon the doctor,  then upon Dean, and lastly upon his son, and it was quite a minute now  before he opened his lips to emit a long pent up breath.  Then he said,  \"I must give in, doctor; I'm beaten.\"    \"And you will come too, father?\" cried Mark, and his utterance was full  of joyous excitement.    \"Yes, my boy; I'll come.\"        CHAPTER THREE.    FITS OF TEMPER.    \"Don't go to sleep, Dozey.\"    \"Who's going to sleep?\"    \"Your eyes were nearly shut.\"    \"Well, who's to keep them open in this glaring sun?\" cried Dean, half  angrily.    \"Well, don't jump down a fellow's throat.\"    \"It's enough to make one.  I just put my eyes half to, because there's  no shade, and you begin at me directly because once or twice I wouldn't  keep awake to listen to your prosing about something or another after we  had gone to bed, and I did not want to hear.\"    \"I beg pardon,\" cried Mark, with mock politeness.    \"Don't!\" cried Dean pettishly.  \"Now then, what was it you wanted to  say?\"    \"Well, I was going to say, what do you think of it now we have got  here?\"    \"Not much; and if it's going to be all like this I shall soon be wishing  we had stayed at home.\"    \"Same here.  I say, what a lot of gammon they do write in books!  I  always thought Africa was quite a grand country; very hot--\"    \"Oh, it's hot enough,\" said Dean sharply.  \"Yes, it's hot enough to make  everyone seem lazy.  Look at those black fellows there, fast asleep in  the sun with their mouths open and the flies buzzing about.  But I say,  I don't think much of these soldiers.  What little under-sized fellows!\"    \"Haven't done growing, perhaps,\" said Dean.    \"Oh, yes; they are old 'uns.  But they do look like sunburnt boys.  But  I say, I expected something very different from this.  What stuff people  do write in books!  I mean to say it's too bad.\"    \"Yes; just over a month since we started from Southampton, and here we  are dropped in this miserable place along with all our luggage and  boxes, and been caged up in that hotel.  Do you know what I felt when I  first looked ashore?\"    \"No, but I know what I did--as if I should have liked to tell uncle that  we had better stop aboard the steamer, for I was sure we had made a  mistake and come to the wrong place.\"    \"No, no, I say, play fair; that's what I felt,\" said Mark.    \"You felt?  You couldn't, because that's what I felt.\"    \"Well, I could, for I did feel it exactly.  I say, though; where are Bob  and Pretty Dance?\"    \"Pretty Dance,\" said Dean dreamily.  \"Yes, we have been in a pretty  dance, and no mistake.  I don't know where they are.  Wandering about  somewhere having a look at what shipping there is, for there isn't much  to see in the town.\"    \"I say, I hope those two fellows are keeping an eye on the cases.  It  would be a nice job if someone opened our luggage and got at the guns.\"    \"Oh, the landlord said that would be all right.  Phew!  It is hot!  Here, let's go and talk to the doctor.\"    \"No, don't disturb him; he's lying down and having a nap.  Let's go and  talk to uncle.\"    \"He's gone to lie down and have a nap too.\"    \"Bother!  I thought as soon as we got ashore it was all going to be  interesting and beautiful, and that we should be having glorious  adventures.  I don't know how we are going to get through it.\"    \"Get through what?\"    \"Those three days before we can start up the country.\"    \"Oh, there they are,\" said Dean sharply.    \"Who?\"    \"Our two keepers.\"    \"Let's go and talk to them, then.  Poor old Bacon.  If it's going to be  like this Bob will be frizzled.\"    \"Well, don't walk so fast.  I say, it must be hot.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because I feel as if I had got too many clothes on.\"    \"Ah, it will be hotter than this; but it's the only thing that makes me  think we are in a foreign country.  Here, who's this?  Why, it's that  sailor again.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dean.  \"What does he want?  He was following us about all  day yesterday when we were trying to look at the town.\"    \"What does he want?  Coppers, of course.  He's a beggar.\"    \"Well, he doesn't look like one.  No, that isn't it.  He's got a boat  somewhere, and wants to take us up the river for a row.  Shall we go?\"    \"No; it's too hot.  Think we could buy an umbrella somewhere?\"    \"What for?  It looks as if it had not rained here for a twelvemonth.\"    \"Keep the sun off.\"    \"Oh, I see.  Come along, then, till we get to those stores, and we can  buy one there, I daresay; but I shan't walk with you if you put it up.  Bother you and your umbrella!  Are you afraid you'll melt?\"    \"I am melting.\"    As Dean spoke very surlily, \"that sailor,\" as Mark called him, a little  stumpy fellow who looked as though he should have been plump and rosy,  but who was ghastly pale instead, sauntered up slowly, looking very hard  at Mark, and opened his lips as if to say something, but closed them  again as if with an effort.    He was dressed in a sailor's canvas frock and loose trousers, both of  which articles of attire were old and shabby but scrupulously clean,  while his hat, a very old straw, showed an ugly rent which its owner had  apparently tried to hide by means of the silken band just above its  brim.  But the band had slipped upwards so that a good-sized patch of  crisp, curly, black hair had escaped and thrust its way out into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#3)"],[1,"their  pen and scattered in every direction, through barnyard and garden and  nearer fields. Bleating and stampeding, they ran. Link Ferris blinked  after them, and broke into speech. Loudly and luridly he swore.    This stampede might well mean an hour's running to and fro before the  scattered flock could be herded once more. An hour of panting and  blasphemous pursuit, at the very outset of an overbusy day. And all  because of one worthless dog.    His father had been right. Link saw that--now that it was too late. A  dog had no place on a farm. A poor man could not afford the silly  luxury of a useless pet. With whistle and call Ferris sought to check  the flight of the flock. But, as every farmer knows, there is nothing  else on earth quite so unreasonable and idiotic as a scared sheep. The  familiar summons did not slacken nor swerve the stampede.    The fact that this man had been their protector and friend made no  difference to the idiotic sheep. They were frightened. And, therefore,  the tenuously thin connecting line between them and their human master  had snapped. For the moment they were merely wild animals, and he was a  member of a hostile race--almost as much as was the huge dog that had  caused their fright.    A wistful whine from Chum interrupted Link's volley of swearing. The  dog had noted his master's angry excitement and was seeking to offer  sympathy or help.    But the reminder of Chum's presence did not check Link's wrath at the  unconscious cause of the stampede. He loosed his hold on the collar,  resolving to take out his rage in an unmerciful beating should the dog  seek to chase the fleeing sheep. That would be at least an outlet for  the impotent wrath which Ferris sought to wreak on someone or something.    \"Go get 'em then, if you're so set on it!\" he howled at the collie,  waving a windmill arm at the fugitives. \"Only I'll whale your measly  head off if you do!\"    The invitation and the gesture that went with it seemed to rouse some  long-dormant memory in the collie's soul. Like a flash he was off in  flying pursuit of the sheep. Ferris, in the crazy rage which possessed  him, hoped Chum might bite at least one of the senseless creatures that  were causing him such a waste of precious time and of grudged effort.    Wherefore he did not call back the fastrunning collie. It would be time  enough to whale the daylight out of him--yes, and to rescue his  possible victims from death--when the dog should have overhauled the  woolly pests. So, in dour fury, Link watched the pursuit and the flight.    Then, of a sudden, the black rage in Ferris's visage changed to  perplexity, and slowly from that to crass wonderment.    Six of the sheep had remained bunched in their runaway dash, while all  the rest had scattered singly. It was after this bleating sextet that  Chum was now racing.    Nor did he stop when he came up with them. Tearing past them he wheeled  almost in midair and slackened his pace, running transversely ahead of  them and breaking into a clamor of barks.    The six, seeing their foe menacing them from in front, came to a  jumbled and slithering halt, preparing to break their formation and to  scatter. But Chum would not have it so.    Still threatening them with his thunderous bark he made little dashes  at one or another of them that tried to break away; and he crowded back  the rest.    As a result, there was but one direction the dazed sheep could  take--the direction whence they had come. And, uncertainly,  shamblingly, they made their way back toward the fold.    Scarce had they been fairly started in their cowed progress when Chum  was off at a tangent, deserting his six charges and bearing down with  express train speed on a stray wether that had paused in his escape to  nibble at a line of early peas in the truck garden.    At sight of the approaching collie the sheep flung up its head and  began again to  run. But the dog was in front of it, whichever way the  panic-stricken  animal turned;--in every direction but one. And in that  direction fled the fugitive. Nor did it stop in its headlong flight  until it was alongside the six which Chum had first \"turned\".    Pausing only long enough to round up one or two sheep which were  breaking loose from the bunch Chum was off again in headlong chase of  still another and another and another stray.    Link Ferris, in blank incredulity, stood gaping at the picture before  him--staring at the tireless swiftness of his dog in turning back and  rounding up a scattered flock which Ferris himself could not have  bunched in twenty times the space of minutes. Chum, he noted, did not  touch one of the foolish beasts. His bark and his zigzag dashes served  the purpose, without the aid of teeth or of actual contact.    Presently, as the dumbfounded man gazed, the last stray was added to  the milling, bleating bunch, and Chum was serenely trotting to and fro,  driving back such of the sheep as sought to break loose from the  huddle. Terrified and trembling, but mastered, the flock cowered  motionless. The work was done.    As in a dream Link tumbled toward the prisoners. His mind functioning  subconsciously, he took up his interrupted task of driving them to  pasture. The moment he succeeded in getting them into motion they broke  again. And again, like a furry whirlwind, Chum was encircling them;  chasing the strays into place. He saw, without being told, the course  his master was taking, and he drove his charges accordingly.    Thus, in far less time and in better order than ever before, the flock  reached the  rickety gateway of the stone-strewn sheep pasture and  scuttled jostlingly  in through it.    Link shut the gate after them. Then, still in a daze, he turned on the  dog.    \"Chum,\" he said confusedly, \"it don't make sense to me, not even yet. I  don't get the hang of it. But I know this much: I know you got ten  times the sense what I'VE got. Where you got it an' how you got it the  good Lord only knows. But you've got it. I--I was figgerin' on lickin'  you 'most to death, a few minutes back. Chum. Honest, I was. I'm clean  'shamed to look you in the face when I think of it. Say! Do me a favor,  Chum. If ever I lift hand to lick you, jes' bite me and give me  hydrophoby. For I'll sure be deservin' it. Now come on home!\"    He patted the silken head of the jubilant dog as he talked, rumpling  the soft ears and stroking the long, blazed muzzle. He was sick at  heart at memory of his recent murderous rage at this wonder-comrade of  his.    Chum was exultantly happy. He had had a most exhilarating ten minutes.  The jolliest bit of fun he could remember in all his two years of life.  The sight of those queer sheep--yes, and the scent of them, especially  the scent--had done queer things to his brain; had aroused a million  sleeping ancestral memories.    He had understood perfectly well his master's order that he leave them  alone. And he had been disappointed by it. He himself had not known  clearly what it was he would have liked to do to them. But he had known  he and they ought to have some sort of relationship. And then at the  gesture and the snarled command of \"Go get them!\" some closed door in  Chum's  mind had swung wide, and, acting  on an instinct he himself did  not understand, he had hurled himself into the gay task of rounding up  the flock.    So, for a thousand generations on the Scottish hills, had Chum's  ancestors earned their right to live. And so through successive  generations had they imbued their progeny with that accomplishment  until it had become a primal instinct. Even as the unbroken pointer of  the best type knows by instinct the rudiments of his work in the field  so will many a collie take up sheep herding by ancestral training.    There had been nothing wonderful in Chum's exploit. Hundreds of  untrained collies have done the same thing on their first sight of  sheep. The craving to chase and slay sheep is a mere perversion of this  olden instinct; just as the disorderly \"flushing\" and scattering of  bird coveys is a perversion of the pointer or setter instinct. Chum,  luckily for himself and for his master's flock, chanced to run true to  form in this matter of heredity, instead of inheriting his tendency in  the form of a taste for sheep murder.    The first collie, back in prehistoric days, was the first dog with the  wit to know his master's sheep apart from all other sheep. Perhaps that  is the best, if least scientific, theory of the collie's origin.    But to Link Ferris's unsophisticated eyes the achievement was all but  supernatural, and it doubled his love for the dog.    That afternoon, by way of experiment, Ferris took Chum along when he  went to drive the sheep back from pasture to the fold. By the time he  and the dog were within a hundred yards of the pasture gate Chum began  to dance, from sheer anticipation; mincing sidewise on the tips of his  toes in true collie fashion,  and varying the dance by little rushes  forward.    Link opened the crazy gate. Waiting for no further encouragement the  dog sped into the broad field and among the grazing sheep that were  distributed unevenly over the entire area of the lot.    Ordinarily--unless the sheep were ready to come home--it was a matter  of ten or fifteen minutes each evening for Link to collect them and  start them on their way. To-day, in less than three minutes, Chum had  the whole flock herded and trotting through the opening, to the lane  outside.    Nor, this time, did the sheep flee from him in the same panic dread as  in the morning. They seemed to have learned--if indeed a sheep can ever  learn anything--that Chum was their driver, not their enemy.    From the fold Link as usual went to the woodlot where his five head of  lean milch cattle were at graze. Three of the cows were waiting at the  bars for him, but one heifer and a new-dry Holstein were hidden  somewhere in the recesses of the second-growth"]]]
