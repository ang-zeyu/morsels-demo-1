Said Leopard to Baviaan (and it was a very hot day), 'Where has all the  game gone?'    And Baviaan winked. He knew.    Said the Ethiopian to Baviaan, 'Can you tell me the present habitat  of the aboriginal Fauna?' (That meant just the same thing, but the  Ethiopian always used long words. He was a grown-up.)    And Baviaan winked. He knew.    Then said Baviaan, 'The game has gone into other spots; and my advice to  you, Leopard, is to go into other spots as soon as you can.'    And the Ethiopian said, 'That is all very fine, but I wish to know  whither the aboriginal Fauna has migrated.'    Then said Baviaan, 'The aboriginal Fauna has joined the aboriginal Flora  because it was high time for a change; and my advice to you, Ethiopian,  is to change as soon as you can.'    That puzzled the Leopard and the Ethiopian, but they set off to look for  the aboriginal Flora, and presently, after ever so many days, they saw  a great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks all 'sclusively speckled  and sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and slashed and hatched  and cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud, and you will  see how very shadowy the forest must have been.)    'What is this,' said the Leopard, 'that is so 'sclusively dark, and yet  so full of little pieces of light?'    'I don't know, said the Ethiopian, 'but it ought to be the aboriginal  Flora. I can smell Giraffe, and I can hear Giraffe, but I can't see  Giraffe.'    'That's curious,' said the Leopard. 'I suppose it is because we have  just come in out of the sunshine. I can smell Zebra, and I can hear  Zebra, but I can't see Zebra.'    'Wait a bit, said the Ethiopian. 'It's a long time since we've hunted  'em. Perhaps we've forgotten what they were like.'    'Fiddle!' said the Leopard. 'I remember them perfectly on the High  Veldt, especially their marrow-bones. Giraffe is about seventeen feet  high, of a 'sclusively fulvous golden-yellow from head to heel; and  Zebra is about four and a half feet high, of a'sclusively grey-fawn  colour from head to heel.'    'Umm, said the Ethiopian, looking into the speckly-spickly shadows of  the aboriginal Flora-forest. 'Then they ought to show up in this dark  place like ripe bananas in a smokehouse.'    But they didn't. The Leopard and the Ethiopian hunted all day; and  though they could smell them and hear them, they never saw one of them.    'For goodness' sake,' said the Leopard at tea-time, 'let us wait till it  gets dark. This daylight hunting is a perfect scandal.'    So they waited till dark, and then the Leopard heard something breathing  sniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through the branches, and  he jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra, and it felt like Zebra,  and when he knocked it down it kicked like Zebra, but he couldn't see  it. So he said, 'Be quiet, O you person without any form. I am going to  sit on your head till morning, because there is something about you that  I don't understand.'    Presently he heard a grunt and a crash and a scramble, and the Ethiopian  called out, 'I've caught a thing that I can't see. It smells like  Giraffe, and it kicks like Giraffe, but it hasn't any form.'    'Don't you trust it,' said the Leopard. 'Sit on its head till the  morning--same as me. They haven't any form--any of 'em.'    So they sat down on them hard till bright morning-time, and then Leopard  said, 'What have you at your end of the table, Brother?'    The Ethiopian scratched his head and said, 'It ought to be 'sclusively a  rich fulvous orange-tawny from head to heel, and it ought to be Giraffe;  but it is covered all over with chestnut blotches. What have you at your  end of the table, Brother?'    And the Leopard scratched his head and said, 'It ought to be 'sclusively  a delicate greyish-fawn, and it ought to be Zebra; but it is covered  all over with black and purple stripes. What in the world have you been  doing to yourself, Zebra? Don't you know that if you were on the High  Veldt I could see you ten miles off? You haven't any form.'    'Yes,' said the Zebra, 'but this isn't the High Veldt. Can't you see?'    'I can now,' said the Leopard. 'But I couldn't all yesterday. How is it  done?'    'Let us up,' said the Zebra, 'and we will show you.    They let the Zebra and the Giraffe get up; and Zebra moved away to some  little thorn-bushes where the sunlight fell all stripy, and Giraffe  moved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all blotchy.    'Now watch,' said the Zebra and the Giraffe. 'This is the way it's done.  One--two--three! And where's your breakfast?'    Leopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but all they could see were stripy  shadows and blotched shadows in the forest, but never a sign of Zebra  and Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden themselves in the  shadowy forest.    'Hi! Hi!' said the Ethiopian. 'That's a trick worth learning. Take a  lesson by it, Leopard. You show up in this dark place like a bar of soap  in a coal-scuttle.'    'Ho! Ho!' said the Leopard. 'Would it surprise you very much to know  that you show up in this dark place like a mustard-plaster on a sack of  coals?'    'Well, calling names won't catch dinner, said the Ethiopian. 'The long  and the little of it is that we don't match our backgrounds. I'm going  to take Baviaan's advice. He told me I ought to change; and as I've  nothing to change except my skin I'm going to change that.'    'What to?' said the Leopard, tremendously excited.    'To a nice working blackish-brownish colour, with a little purple in  it, and touches of slaty-blue. It will be the very thing for hiding in  hollows and behind trees.'    So he changed his skin then and there, and the Leopard was more excited  than ever; he had never seen a man change his skin before.    'But what about me?' he said, when the Ethiopian had worked his last  little finger into his fine new black skin.    'You take Baviaan's advice too. He told you to go into spots.'    'So I did,' said the Leopard. I went into other spots as fast as I  could. I went into this spot with you, and a lot of good it has done  me.'    'Oh,' said the Ethiopian, 'Baviaan didn't mean spots in South Africa. He  meant spots on your skin.'    'What's the use of that?' said the Leopard.    'Think of Giraffe,' said the Ethiopian. 'Or if you prefer stripes,  think of Zebra. They find their spots and stripes give them per-feet  satisfaction.'    'Umm,' said the Leopard. 'I wouldn't look like Zebra--not for ever so.'    'Well, make up your mind,' said the Ethiopian, 'because I'd hate to  go hunting without you, but I must if you insist on looking like a  sun-flower against a tarred fence.'    'I'll take spots, then,' said the Leopard; 'but don't make 'em too  vulgar-big. I wouldn't look like Giraffe--not for ever so.'    'I'll make 'em with the tips of my fingers,' said the Ethiopian.  'There's plenty of black left on my skin still. Stand over!'    Then the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together (there was plenty  of black left on his new skin still) and pressed them all over the  Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little  black marks, all close together. You can see them on any Leopard's skin  you like, Best Beloved. Sometimes the fingers slipped and the marks got  a little blurred; but if you look closely at any Leopard now you will  see that there are always five spots--off five fat black finger-tips.    'Now you are a beauty!' said the Ethiopian. 'You can lie out on the bare  ground and look like a heap of pebbles. You can lie out on the naked  rocks and look like a piece of pudding-stone. You can lie out on a leafy  branch and look like sunshine sifting through the leaves; and you  can lie right across the centre of a path and look like nothing in  particular. Think of that and purr!'    'But if I'm all this,' said the Leopard, 'why didn't you go spotty too?'    'Oh, plain black's best for a nigger,' said the Ethiopian. 'Now come  along and we'll see if we can't get even with Mr. One-Two-Three Where's  your Breakfast!'    So they went away and lived happily ever afterward, Best Beloved. That  is all.    Oh, now and then you will hear grown-ups say, 'Can the Ethiopian change  his skin or the Leopard his spots?' I don't think even grown-ups would  keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian  hadn't done it once--do you? But they will never do it again, Best  Beloved. They are quite contented as they are.         I AM the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in most wise tones,     'Let us melt into the landscape--just us two by our lones.'     People have come--in a carriage--calling. But Mummy is there....     Yes, I can go if you take me--Nurse says she don't care.     Let's go up to the pig-sties and sit on the farmyard rails!     Let's say things to the bunnies, and watch 'em skitter their tails!     Let's--oh, anything, daddy, so long as it's you and me,     And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!     Here's your boots (I've brought 'em), and here's your cap and stick,     And here's your pipe and tobacco. Oh, come along out of it--quick.          THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD    IN the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no  trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he  could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things  with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's  Child--who was full of 'satiable curtiosity, and that means he asked  ever so many questions. And he lived in Africa, and he filled all Africa  with his 'satiable curtiosities. He asked his tall aunt, the Ostrich,  why her tail-feathers grew just so, and his tall aunt the Ostrich  spanked him with her hard, hard claw.

ON THE ACQUISITION OF DHARMA, ARTHA AND KAMA.      Man, the period of whose life is one hundred years, should practise  Dharma, Artha, and Kama at different times and in such a manner that  they may harmonize together and not clash in any way. He should acquire  learning in his childhood, in his youth and middle age he should attend  to Artha and Kama, and in his old age he should perform Dharma, and thus  seek to gain Moksha, _i.e._, release from further transmigration. Or, on  account of the uncertainty of life, he may practise them at times when  they are enjoined to be practised. But one thing is to be noted, he  should lead the life of a religious student until he finishes his  education.    _Dharma_ is obedience to the command of the Shastra or Holy Writ of the  Hindoos to do certain things, such as the performance of sacrifices,  which are not generally done because they do not belong to this world,  and produce no visible effect; and not to do other things, such as  eating meat, which is often done because it belongs to this world, and  has visible effects.    Dharma should be learnt from the Shruti (Holy Writ), and from those  conversant with it.    _Artha_ is the acquisition of arts, land, gold, cattle, wealth,  equipages and friends. It is, further, the protection of what is  acquired, and the increase of what is protected.    Artha should be learnt from the king's officers, and from merchants who  may be versed in the ways of commerce.    _Kama_ is the enjoyment of appropriate objects by the five senses of  hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, and smelling, assisted by the mind  together with the soul. The ingredient in this is a peculiar contact  between the organ of sense and its object, and the consciousness of  pleasure which arises from that contact is called Kama.    Kama is to be learnt from the Kama Sutra (aphorisms on love) and from  the practice of citizens.    When all the three, viz., Dharma, Artha, and Kama come together, the  former is better than the one which follows it, _i.e._, Dharma is better  than Artha, and Artha is better than Kama. But Artha should be always  first practised by the king, for the livelihood of men is to be obtained  from it only. Again, Kama being the occupation of public women, they  should prefer it to the other two, and these are exceptions to the  general rule.      _Objection 1._    Some learned men say that as Dharma is connected with things not  belonging to this world, it is appropriately treated of in a book; and  so also is Artha, because it is practised only by the application of  proper means, and a knowledge of those means can only be obtained by  study and from books. But Kama being a thing which is practised even by  the brute creation, and which is to be found everywhere, does not want  any work on the subject.      _Answer._    This is not so. Sexual intercourse being a thing dependent on man and  woman requires the application of proper means by them, and those means  are to be learnt from the Kama Shastra. The non-application of proper  means, which we see in the brute creation, is caused by their being  unrestrained, and by the females among them only being fit for sexual  intercourse at certain seasons and no more, and by their intercourse not  being preceded by thought of any kind.      _Objection 2._    The Lokayatikas[4] say:--Religious ordinances should not be observed,  for they bear a future fruit, and at the same time it is also doubtful  whether they will bear any fruit at all. What foolish person will give  away that which is in his own hands into the hands of another?  Moreover, it is better to have a pigeon to-day than a peacock to-morrow;  and a copper coin which we have the certainty of obtaining, is better  than a gold coin, the possession of which is doubtful.      _Answer._    It is not so. 1st. Holy Writ, which ordains the practice of Dharma, does  not admit of a doubt.    2nd. Sacrifices such as those made for the destruction of enemies, or  for the fall of rain, are seen to bear fruit.    3rd. The sun, moon, stars, planets and other heavenly bodies appear to  work intentionally for the good of the world.    4th. The existence of this world is effected by the observance of the  rules respecting the four classes[5] of men and their four stages of  life.    5th. We see that seed is thrown into the ground with the hope of future  crops.    Vatsyayana is therefore of opinion that the ordinances of religion must  be obeyed.      _Objection 3._    Those who believe that destiny is the prime mover of all things say:--We  should not exert ourselves to acquire wealth, for sometimes it is not  acquired although we strive to get it, while at other times it comes to  us of itself without any exertion on our part. Everything is therefore  in the power of destiny, who is the lord of gain and loss, of success  and defeat, of pleasure and pain. Thus we see the Bali[6] was raised to  the throne of Indra by destiny, and was also put down by the same power,  and it is destiny only that can re-instate him.      _Answer._    It is not right to say so. As the acquisition of every object  pre-supposes at all events some exertion on the part of man, the  application"]]]
