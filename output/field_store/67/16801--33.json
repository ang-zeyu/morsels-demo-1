Europe was menaced; the South of France was  all but destroyed.    Again the Frank descended; and like a great wind blowing clouds from a  stormy sky, Charles Martel swept back the Arabs and saved Christianity.  Before 740, he had returned a third time to the South, not as a  deliverer, but for pure love of conquest; and by dismantling Nimes,  destroying the maritime cities of Maguelonne and Agde, and taking the  powerful strongholds of Arles and Marseilles, he paved the way for his  great descendant who nominally united \"all France.\"    But Charlemagne's empire fell in pieces; and as Carlovingian had  succeeded Merovingian, so in 987 Capetian displaced the weak descendants  of the mighty head of the \"Holy Roman Empire.\" The map changed with  bewildering frequency; and in these changes, the nobles--more stable  than their kings--grew to be the real lords of their several domains.  History speaks of France from Clovis to the Revolution as a kingdom; but  even later than the First Crusade the kingdom lay somewhere between  Paris and Lyons; the Royal Domain, not France as we know it now. The  Duchy of Aquitaine, the Duchy of Brittany, Burgundy, the Counties of  Toulouse, Provence, Champagne, Normandy, and many smaller possessions,  were as proudly separate in spirit as Norway and Sweden, and often as  politically distinct as they from Denmark.    In the midst of these times of turmoil the Church had steadily grown.  Every change, however fatal to North or South, brought to her new  strength. Confronted with cultured paganism in the first centuries, the  blood of her martyrs made truly fruitful seed for her victories; and  later, facing paganism of another, wilder race, she triumphed more  peacefully in the one supreme conversion of Clovis; and the devotion and  interest which from that day grew between Church and King, gradually  made her the greatest power of the country. After the decline of Roman  culture the Church was the one intellectual, almost peaceful, and  totally irresistible force. The great lords scorned learning. An Abbot,  quaintly voicing the Church's belief, said that \"every letter writ on  paper is a sword thrust in the devil's side.\" When there was cessation  of war, the occupation of men, from Clovis' time throughout Mediaevalism,  was gone. They could not read; they could not write; the joy of hunting  was, in time, exhausted. They were restless, lost. The justice meted out  by the great lords was, too often, the right of might. But at the  Council of Orleans, in 511, a church was declared an inviolable refuge,  where the weak should be safe until their case could be calmly and  righteously judged. The beneficent care of the Church cannot be  overestimated. Between 500 and 700 she had eighty-three councils in  Gaul, and scarcely one but brought a reform,--a real amelioration of  hardships.    Something of the general organisation of her great power in those rude  times deserves more than the usual investigation. Even in its small  place in the \"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France,\" it is an  interesting bit of Church politics and psychology.    The ecclesiastical tradition of France goes back to the very first years  of the Christian era. Lazarus, Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Mary the  Mother of James, are only a few of those intimately connected with  Christ Himself, who are believed to have come into Gaul; and in their  efforts to systematically and surely establish Christianity, to have  founded the first French Bishoprics. This is tradition. But even the  history of the II century tells of a venerable, martyred Bishop of  Lyons, a disciple of that Polycarp who knew Saint John; and in the III  century Gaul added no less than fourteen to the Sees she already had.  Enthusiastic tradition aside, it is evident that the missionary ardour  of the Gallic priests was intense; and the glory of their early  victories belongs entirely to a branch of the Church known as \"the  Secular Clergy.\"    [Illustration: THE TOWER OF AN EARLY MARITIME CATHEDRAL.--AGDE.]    The other great branch, \"the Religious Orders,\" were of later  institution. From the oriental deserts of the Thebaid, where Saint  Anthony had early practised the austerities of monkish life, Saint  Martin drew his inspiration for the monasticism of the West. But it was  not until the last of the IV century that he founded, near Poitiers, the  first great monastery in France. The success of this form of pious life,  if not altogether edifying, was immediate. Devotional excesses were less  common in the temperate climate of France than under the exciting  oriental sun, yet that most bizarre of Eastern fanatics, the \"Pillar  Saint,\" had at least one disciple in Gaul. He--the good Brother  Wulfailich--began the life of sanctity by climbing a column near Treves,  and prepared himself to stand on it, barefooted, through winter and  summer, till, presumably, angels should bear him triumphantly to heaven.  But the West is not the East. And the good Bishops of the neighbourhood  drew off, instead of waiting at the pillar, as an exalted emperor had  humbly stood beneath that of Saint Simeon Stylites. Far from being  awe-struck, they were scandalised; and they forced Wulfailich to descend  from his eminence, and destroyed it. This is one of the first Gallic  instances of the antagonisms between the \"secular\" and the \"regular\"  branches of the reverend clergy.    Within the French Church from early times, these two great forces were  arrayed, marching toward the same great end,--but never marching  together. It is claimed they were, and are, inimical. In theory, in  ideal, nothing could be further from truth. They were in fact sometimes  unfriendly; and more often than not mutually suspicious. For the great  Abbot inevitably lived in a Bishop's See; and with human tempers beneath  their churchly garb, Abbot and Bishop could not always agree. Now the  Bishop was lord of the clergy, supreme in his diocese; but should he  call to account the lowest friar of any monastery, my Lord Abbot replied  that he was \"answerable only to the Pope,\" and retired to his vexatious  \"imperium in imperio.\"    The beginning of the VI century saw much that was irregular in monastic  life. The whole country was either in a state of war or of unrestful  expectation of war. Many Abbeys were yet to be established; many merely  in process of foundation. Wandering brothers were naturally beset by the  dangers and temptations of an unsettled life; and if history may be  believed, fell into many irregularities and even shamed their cloth by  licentiousness. Into this disorder came the great and holy Benedict, the  \"learnedly ignorant, the wisely unlearned,\" the true organiser of  Western Monachism. Under his wise \"Rules\" the Abbey of the VI century  was transformed. It became \"not only a place of prayer and meditation,  but a refuge against barbarism in all its forms. And this home of books  and knowledge had departments of all kinds, and its dependencies formed  what we would call to-day a 'model farm.' There were to be found  examples of activity and industry for the workman, the common tiller of  the soil, or the land-owner himself. It was a school,\" continues  Thierry, \"not of religion, but of practical knowledge; and when it is  considered that there were two hundred and thirty-eight of such schools  in Clovis' day, the power of the Orders, though late in coming, will be  seen to have grown as great as that of the Bishops.\"    From these two branches sprang all that is greatest in the  ecclesiastical architecture of France. As their strength grew, their  respective churches were built, and to-day, as a sign of their dual  power, we have the Abbey and the Cathedral.    The Bishop's church had its prototype in the first Christian meeting  places in Rome and was planned from two basic ideas,--the part of the  Roman house which was devoted to early Christian service, and the  growing exigencies of the ritual itself. At the very first of the  Christian era, converts met in any room, but these little groups so soon  grew to communities that a larger place was needed and the \"basilica\" of  the house became the general and accepted place of worship. The  \"basilica\" was composed of a long hall, sometimes galleried, and a  hemicycle; and its general outline was that of a letter T. Into this  purely secular building, Christian ceremonials were introduced. The  hemicycle became the apse; the gallery, a clerestory; the hall, a  central nave. Here the paraphernalia of the new Church were installed.  The altar stood in the apse; and between it and the nave, on either  side, a pulpit or reading-desk was placed. Bishop and priests sat around  the altar, the people in the nave. This disposition of clergy, people,  and the furniture of the sacred office is essentially that of the  Cathedral of to-day. There were however many amplifications of the first  type. The basilica form, T, was enlarged to that of a cross; and  increasingly beautiful architectural forms were evolved. Among the first  was the tower of the early Italian churches. This single tower was  doubled in the French Romanesque, often multiplied again by Gothic  builders, and in Byzantine churches, increased to seven and even nine  domes. Transepts were added, and as, one by one, the arts came to the  knowledge of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, each was pressed into  the service of the Cathedral builders. The interior became so beautiful  with carvings, windows of marvellously painted glass, rich tapestries  and frescoes, that the ritual seemed yearly more impressive and  awe-inspiring. The old, squat exterior of early days was forgotten in  new height and majesty, and the Cathedral became the dominant building  of the city.    Although the country was early christianised, and on the map of  Merovingian France nearly all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#3)"],[1,"1844 MS. is written in my  father's hand \"This was sketched in 1839.\" Again in a letter to Mr  Wallace{20} (Jan. 25, 1859) he speaks of his own contributions to the  Linnean paper{21} of July 1, 1858, as \"written in 1839, now just twenty  years ago.\" This statement as it stands is undoubtedly incorrect, since  the extracts are from the MS. of 1844, about the date of which no doubt  exists; but even if it could be supposed to refer to the 1842 Essay, it  must, I think, be rejected. I can only account for his mistake by the  supposition that my father had in mind the date (1839) at which the  framework of his theory was laid down. It is worth noting that in his  Autobiography (p. 88) he speaks of the time \"about 1839, when the theory  was clearly conceived.\" However this may be there can be no doubt that  1842 is the correct date. Since the publication of _Life and Letters_ I  have gained fresh evidence on this head. A small packet containing 13  pp. of MS. came to light in 1896. On the outside is written \"First  Pencil Sketch of Species Theory. Written at Maer and Shrewsbury during  May and June 1842.\" It is not however written in pencil, and it consists  of a single chapter on _The Principles of Variation in Domestic  Organisms_. A single unnumbered page is written in pencil, and is headed  \"Maer, May 1842, useless\"; it also bears the words \"This page was  thought of as introduction.\" It consists of the briefest sketch of the  geological evidence for evolution, together with words intended as  headings for discussion,--such as \"Affinity,--unity of type,--foetal  state,--abortive organs.\"         {18} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 116.         {19} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 10.         {20} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 146.         {21} _J. Linn. Soc. Zool._ iii. p. 45.    The back of this \"useless\" page is of some interest, although it does  not bear on the question of date,--the matter immediately before us.    It seems to be an outline of the Essay or sketch of 1842, consisting of  the titles of the three chapters of which it was to have consisted.    \"I. The Principles of Var. in domestic organisms.    \"II. The possible and probable application of these same principles to  wild animals and consequently the possible and probable production of  wild races, analogous to the domestic ones of plants and animals.    \"III. The reasons for and against believing that such races have really  been produced, forming what are called species.\"    It will be seen that Chapter III as originally designed corresponds to  Part II (p. 22) of the Essay of 1842, which is (p. 7) defined by the  author as discussing \"whether the characters and relations of animated  things are such as favour the idea of wild species being races descended  from a common stock.\" Again at p. 23 the author asks \"What then is the  evidence in favour of it (the theory of descent) and what the evidence  against it.\" The generalised section of his Essay having been originally  Chapter III{22} accounts for the curious error which occurs in pp. 18  and 22 where the second Part of the Essay is called Part III.         {22} It is evident that _Parts_ and _Chapters_ were to some extent       interchangeable in the author's mind, for p. 1 (of the MS. we have       been discussing) is headed in ink Chapter I, and afterwards altered       in pencil to Part I.    The division of the Essay into two parts is maintained in the enlarged  Essay of 1844, in which he writes: \"The Second Part of this work is  devoted to the general consideration of how far the general economy of  nature justifies or opposes the belief that related species and genera  are descended from common stocks.\" The _Origin of Species_ however is  not so divided.    We may now return to the question of the date of the Essay. I have found  additional evidence in favour of 1842 in a sentence written on the back  of the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS.--not the copied version but the  original in my father's writing: \"This was written and enlarged from a  sketch in 37 pages{23} in Pencil (the latter written in summer of 1842  at Maer and Shrewsbury) in beginning of 1844, and finished it <_sic_> in  July; and finally corrected the copy by Mr Fletcher in the last week in  September.\" On the whole it is impossible to doubt that 1842 is the date  of the earlier of the two Essays.         {23} On p. 23 of the MS. of the _Foundations_ is a reference to the       \"back of p. 21 bis\": this suggests that additional pages had been       interpolated in the MS. and that it may once have had 37 in place       of 35 pp.    The sketch of 1842 is written on bad paper with a soft pencil, and is in  many parts extremely difficult to read, many of the words ending in mere  scrawls and being illegible without context. It is evidently written  rapidly, and is in his most elliptical style, the articles being  frequently omitted, and the sentences being loosely composed and often  illogical in structure. There is much erasure and correction, apparently  made at the moment of writing, and the MS. does not give the impression  of having been re-read with any care. The whole is more like hasty  memoranda of what was clear to himself, than material for the convincing  of others.    Many of the pages are covered with writing on the back, an instance of  his parsimony in the matter of paper{24}. This matter consists partly of  passages marked for insertion in the text, and these can generally  (though by no means always) be placed where he intended. But he also  used the back of one page for a preliminary sketch to be rewritten on a  clean sheet. These parts of the work have been printed as footnotes, so  as to allow what was written on the front of the pages to form a  continuous text. A certain amount of repetition is unavoidable, but much  of what is written on the backs of the pages is of too much interest to  be omitted. Some of the matter here given in footnotes may, moreover,  have been intended as the final text and not as the preliminary sketch.         {24} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 153.    When a word cannot be deciphered, it is replaced by:--<illegible>, the  angular brackets being, as already explained, a symbol for an insertion  by the editor. More commonly, however, the context makes the  interpretation of a word reasonably sure although the word is not  strictly legible. Such words are followed by an inserted mark of  interrogation <?>. Lastly, words inserted by the editor, of which the  appropriateness is doubtful, are printed thus <variation?>.    Two kinds of erasure occur in the MS. of 1842. One by vertical lines  which seem to have been made when the 35 pp. MS. was being expanded into  that of 1844, and merely imply that such a page is done with: and  secondly the ordinary erasures by horizontal lines. I have not been  quite consistent in regard to these: I began with the intention of  printing (in square brackets) all such erasures. But I ultimately found  that the confusion introduced into the already obscure sentences was  greater than any possible gain; and many such erasures are altogether  omitted. In the same way I have occasionally omitted hopelessly obscure  and incomprehensible fragments, which if printed would only have  burthened the text with a string of <illegible>s and queried words. Nor have I  printed the whole of what is written on the backs of the pages, where it  seemed to me that nothing but unnecessary repetition would have been the  result.    In the matter of punctuation I have given myself a free hand. I may no  doubt have misinterpreted the author's meaning in so doing, but without  such punctuation, the number of repellantly crabbed sentences would have  been even greater than at present. In dealing with the Essay of 1844, I  have corrected some obvious slips without indicating such alterations,  because the MS. being legible, there is no danger of changing the  author's meaning.    The sections into which the Essay of 1842 is divided are in the original  merely indicated by a gap in the MS. or by a line drawn across the page.  No titles are given except in the case of Sec. VIII.; and Sec. II. is the only  section which has a number in the original. I might equally well have  made sections of what are now subsections, _e.g. Natural Selection_ p.  7, or _Extermination_ p. 28. But since the present sketch is the germ of  the Essay of 1844, it seemed best to preserve the identity between the  two works, by using such of the author's divisions as correspond to the  chapters of the enlarged version of 1844. The geological discussion with  which Part II begins corresponds to two chapters (IV and V) of the 1844  Essay. I have therefore described it as Sec.Sec. IV. and V., although I cannot  make sure of its having originally consisted of two sections. With this  exception the ten sections of the Essay of 1842 correspond to the ten  chapters of that of 1844.    The _Origin of Species_ differs from the sketch of 1842 in not being  divided into two parts. But the two volumes resemble each other in  general structure. Both begin with a statement of what may be called the  mechanism of evolution,--variation and selection: in both the argument  proceeds from the study of domestic organisms to that of animals and  plants in a state of nature. This is followed in both by a discussion of  the _Difficulties on Theory_ and this by a section _Instinct_ which in  both cases is treated as a special case of difficulty.    If I had to divide the _Origin_ (first edition) into two parts without  any knowledge of earlier MS., I should, I think, make Part II begin with  Ch. VI, _Difficulties on Theory_. A possible reason why this part of the  argument is given in Part I of the Essay of 1842 may be found in the  Essay of 1844, where it is clear that the chapter on instinct is placed  in Part I because the author thought it of importance to show that  heredity and variation occur in mental attributes.
