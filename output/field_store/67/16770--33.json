Again she has dropped from the clouds!\" The object of his  interest was a tall young woman, scarcely more than twenty-five years of  age, gowned in white cloth with black trimmings, with a white hat turned  straight up on the left side and lined in black. She showed grace and  energy in every movement and intellect and force in every glance.    Her large, sapphire-blue eyes gleamed with the intensity of her  feelings, and the touches of bronze hair that could be seen beneath her  hat gave evidence of the vivacious character of her life.    As she marched with queenly grace at the head of this mighty host of six  thousand American women, Dr. Earl had visions of the reality of the myth  or history, whichever it may be, of Semiramis invading Assyria and the  Amazons conquering Asia.    The entire line of march was no doubt interesting, but the head of the  column was absorbing to our hero, so block after block he marched as  nearly abreast of the banner on the sidewalk as a dense crowd would  permit him, and when the column broke ranks at Union Square he was there  to witness it.    No sooner did the mysterious banner bearer quit the march than she  rushed to the custodian of the posters, and, gathering an armful, she  coaxed, or with mock heroics terrorized, every person she approached  into buying one for \"the good of the Cause!\"    Earl was certain his heart would never beat again when she asked him in  deep, musical tones to \"Please buy one for the Cause.\" He did so, and  loitered around watching her a few moments longer, then started up  Broadway.    When he swung into Fifth Avenue he was impressed again, as he had been  when he came from the boat, with the changed atmosphere of the street.  He had always read the mood of New York in its silent reflection in this  expressive part of the city's physiognomy. Long ago, he had discovered  that Fifth Avenue smiles or weeps, applauds or hisses, effervesces with  enthusiasm or gazes somberly like the image of despair, revels in  fervent expressions of patriotism or looks with gloomy distrust upon  public affairs--all according to the mood of the dominant portion of New  York's population--those who control the destinies of the huge private  enterprises that are the marvel of the age, and the management of which  means so much in the way of industrial slavery or economic freedom to  the American people.    This evening there was a note of more seriousness in the air than he had  ever before witnessed on this gay thoroughfare. The rush of automobiles  and taxicabs and carriages with beautifully gowned women and  fine-looking men as occupants was as great as ever; the perfectly  groomed New York woman on the sidewalk, with figure and carriage such as  outclasses the women of every other large city in the world, was there  in numbers quite as great as formerly; the Western woman, who had come  on to take New York by storm, or who imagined the acme of human  existence was in New York cafe life, with all of its vulgar display and  raucous manners, was abundantly in evidence.    But over the entire concourse there appeared to drift an atmosphere of  the spiritual, which lifted them from the plane of the Fifth Avenue  crowd of a year and a half before, and impressed him in the same manner  that he had been impressed in the far East by adepts when they gave  public demonstrations of their powers, or conversed with their Chelae  without the medium of written or spoken language.    When he left America the woman suffrage movement in New York was a  subject of more or less ridicule; a few wealthy women had begun to  identify themselves with it, but they were called \"faddists\" and their  efforts were not taken seriously. It was apparent now that the suffrage  cause had been given the impetus of the world-wide movement that was  reaching the women of all countries, and had changed from a gospel of  tracts to a militant crusade for their share of the duties and  responsibilities of life and the power properly to discharge them. Never  had he seen so many of the real leaders of New York society engaged in  any work, charitable or otherwise, as had taken part in this parade,  marching on foot the full two miles, and often side by side with the  working-women of the city.    He had once seen a painting of the Maid of Orleans in a foreign gallery  that carried so much of spiritual earnestness that he felt that he could  appreciate how easy it was for the French army instinctively to follow  her lead, and how much easier it was for the poor dupes of ignorance and  superstition to believe that this overmastering spiritual nature was the  product of witchcraft.    Absorbing though these thoughts were, they did not exclude another train  which had to do with the mysterious banner bearer, and as he entered his  hotel he clenched his right hand suddenly and muttered to himself, \"I  must dismiss her from my thoughts.\"          CHAPTER III    THE MYSTERIOUS YOUNG WOMAN      Dr. Earl took a late dinner at his sister's house, after having spent an  hour with his fiancee on the way. There were just the four of them at  table, his sister and her husband, his brother and himself.    His sister was the oldest member of his family, which comprised but the  three of them, his father and mother having died some years before.    During the college days of both himself and his brother, who was two  years his junior, his sister had assumed the role of a mother to them,  and right devotedly had she filled the part. She had been more of a  \"pal\" to them than anything else, and some years' residence in England  during her schooldays had broadened her vision of the true meaning and  value of this relation between those of opposite sex and particularly  between brother and sister.    She possessed now, as always, the unbounded respect and confidence of  these two young men of thoroughly dissimilar character and temperament,  and she was the repository of the sacred secrets of each of them, which  she was warned she must never betray to the other. And she never did.    Eight years previous to these occurrences, she had married George  Ramsey, President of the Gotham Trust Company, which institution had  recently absorbed half a dozen weaker concerns doing a similar business,  and more recently had taken over from the New York bankers, who were  stockholders in the trust company, the handling of most of the public  utility securities that were floated in this country. But George Ramsey  was not the pretentious pawnbroker in spirit and manner that so often  presides over the destinies of American banks, but he was a  philosophical financier who understood perfectly the strength and  weakness of the system under which he worked, and who, while he wondered  at the supine idiocy of the people that would permit of the prevailing  Dick Turpin methods of high finance, never took his eye from the horizon  of public action, where daily he expected to see \"the cloud no bigger  than a man's hand\" that was to expand into the storm that would engulf  these and other long permitted public ills.    Many times recently he had sounded the alarm of the dangers attending  recapitalization of properties that already bore a heavy weight of  watered securities, but his colleagues had laughed at what they termed  his fears, and had attempted to reassure him of their complete  possession of the departments of government that controlled such  matters. Bred to the banking business, he had no thought of transferring  his abilities and energies to the realm of statesmanship, but in the  sanctum of his own home he would often pour forth his disgust with, and  his fear of, such methods, to the tall, clear-eyed, clear-brained and  beautiful woman from whom John and Frank Earl were wont to seek advice  in their perplexities. And from her he always received valuable  suggestions, a keener insight into the motives of men, a broader, more  humane view-point, and withal a firmness to set himself, in part, where  the law of the land should have been set wholly, as a barrier against  the worst of these public depredations.    Mr. and Mrs. George Ramsey were the same lovers now that they were  during their honeymoon. In the crowded ballroom, at the opera, in the  automobile after the harassing cares of the day, on land or sea, he was  always the admiring and devoted attendant, and gave expression to his  feelings in a variety of new and interesting ways. It was evident that  they had not run counter to the influence of the stars in waiting for a  natural affinity. In their home they entered into the spirit of whatever  was borne to them by their guests. With scholars and philosophers they  held their own in abstruse and abstract discussions. With musicians and  music lovers they were at ease, for both played and sang with more than  amateur skill. With young people bent on a frolic, they could be the  gayest of the party. Their outlook upon life was always across green  meadows or perfectly kept beds of beautiful flowers.    Every guest found ready sympathy for whatever was nearest and dearest to  him, and went away convinced that he had never rightly understood his  own hobby before.    In this atmosphere, and at table with this couple, John and Frank Earl  seated themselves at eight o'clock for dinner.    It would be difficult to imagine two brothers more widely separated in  physical and mental characteristics. John was tall, athletic, with dark  hair, large, dreamy brown eyes, perfect poise, a silent and dignified  bearing that easily commanded attention when he spoke, a low, musical  voice and an exceedingly strong and graceful hand.    Frank was of medium height, spare of figure, with light hair,  penetrating blue eyes, resilient voice, quick and nervous of speech,  with large hands and feet, and not a shadow of dignity in his bearing.    The one personified "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#3)"],[1,"as seen from  a height. No account is taken of the habitual height of the eye in  relation to the picture. The line of the horizon is placed very high,  parallel lines, instead of joining at the horizon, remain parallel, and  the different planes range one above the other in such a way that the  glance embraces a vast space. Under these conditions, the picture becomes  either high and narrow--a hanging picture--to show the successive planes,  or broad in the form of a scroll, unrolling to reveal an endless  panorama. These are the two forms best known under their Japanese names  of _kakemono_ and _makimono_.[2]    But the Chinese painter must attenuate the forms where they are parallel,  give a natural appearance to their position on different levels and  consider the degree of their reduction demanded by the various planes.  Even he must compromise with binocular vision and arrive at a _perspective  de sentiment_ which, like our own, while scientifically false, is  artistically true. To this linear perspective is added moreover an  atmospheric perspective.    Having elected from a very early time to paint in monochrome, Chinese  painters were led by the nature of this medium to seek to express  atmospheric perspective by means of tone values and harmony of shading  instead of by color. Thus they were familiar with chiaroscuro before the  European painters. Wang Wei established the principles of atmospheric  perspective in the eighth century. He explains how tints are graded, how  the increasing thickness of layers of air deprives distant objects of  their true coloring, substituting a bluish tinge, and how forms become  indistinct in proportion as their distance from the observer increases.  His testimony in this respect is similar to that of Leonardo da Vinci in  his \"Treatise on Painting.\"      [2] The Chinese terms are _Li Chou_ for a vertical painting and    _Heng P'i_ for a horizontal painting.--TRANSLATOR.

DIVISION OF SUBJECTS      The Chinese divide the subjects of painting into four principal classes,  as follows:              Landscape.            Man and Objects.            Flowers and Birds.            Plants and Insects.    Nowhere do we see a predominant place assigned to the drawing or painting  of the human figure. This alone is sufficient to mark the wide difference  between Chinese and European painting.    The exact name for _Landscape_ is translated by the words _mountain and  water picture_. They recall the ancient conception of Creation on which  the Oriental system of the world is founded. The mountain exemplifies the  teeming life of the earth. It is threaded by veins wherein waters  continuously flow. Cascades, brooks and torrents are the outward evidence  of this inner travail. By its own superabundance of life, it brings forth  clouds and arrays itself in mists, thus being a manifestation of the two  principles which rule the life of the universe.    The second class, _Man and Objects_, must be understood principally as  concerning man, his works, his belongings, and, in a general sense, all  things created by the hand of man, in combination with landscape. This was  the convention in early times when the first painters whose artistic  purpose can be formulated with certainty, portrayed the history of the  legendary beings of Taoism,--the genii and fairies dwelling amidst an  imaginary Nature. The records tell us, to be sure, that the early masters  painted portraits, but it was at a later period that _Man and Objects_  composed a class distinct from _Landscape_, a period responsible for those  ancestral portraits painted after death, which are almost always  attributable to ordinary artisans. Earlier they endeavored to apply to  figure painting the methods, technique and laws established for an  ensemble in which the thought of nature predominated. Special rules  bearing on this subject are sometimes found of a very early date but there  is no indication that they were collected into a definite system until the  end of the seventeenth century. Up to the present time our only knowledge  of their content is through a small treatise published at the beginning of  the nineteenth century.    The third class, _Flowers and Birds_, deals with those paintings wherein  the Chinese gave rein to their fancy for painting the bird in conjunction  with the plant life associated with its home and habits. The bird is  treated with a full understanding of its life, and flowers are studied  with such a comprehension of their essential structure that a botanist  can readily detect the characteristics typical of a species, despite the  simplifications which an artist always imposes on the complexity of forms.      [Illustration: PLATE IV. PALACE OF KIU CHENG-KUNG BY LI CHAO-TAO    T'ang Period. Collection of V. Goloubew.]    This general class is subdivided. The epidendrum, the iris, the orchis  and the chrysanthemum became special studies each of which had its own  masters, both from the standpoint of painting itself, and of the  application of the aesthetic rules which govern this art. The bamboo and  the plum tree are also allied to this class. Under the influence of  philosophic and symbolic ideas they furnished a special category of  subjects to the imagination of the painter and form a division apart which  has its own laws and methods, regarding which the Chinese treatises on  Aesthetics inform us fully.    Finally, the fourth class, _Plants and Insects_, is based upon the same  conception as that of _Flowers and Birds_. The insect is represented with  the plant which is his habitat when in the stage of caterpillar and larva,  or flying above the flowers and plants upon which he subsists on reaching  the stage of butterfly and insect. Certain books add to this fourth class  a subdivision comprising fishes.    Lastly we must note that in the Far East, as in Europe, there is a special  class to be taken into consideration, _Religious paintings_. In China,  this refers almost exclusively to Buddhist paintings.          IV. INSPIRATION      The aesthetic conceptions of the Far East have been deeply influenced by a  special philosophy of nature. The Chinese consider the relation of the two  principles, male and female, the _yang_ and the _yin_, as the source of  the universe. Detached from the primordial unity, they give birth to the  forms of this world by ever varying degrees of combination. Heaven  corresponds to the male principle, earth to the female principle.  Everything upon the earth, beings, plants, animals or man is formed by the  mingling of _yang_ and _yin_. While the mountain, enveloped in mists,  recalls the union of these two principles, the legend of forces thus  revealed by no means pauses here. Fabulous or real, the animals and plants  habitually seen in Chinese paintings express a like conception.    The dragon is the ancestor of everything that bears feathers or scales. He  represents the element of water, the waters of the earth, the mists of the  air, the heavenly principle. He is seen breaking through the clouds like  some monstrous apparition, unveiling for an instant the greatness of a  mystery barely discerned. The tiger is the symbol of the earthly  principle, a personification of quadrupeds as distinct from birds and  reptiles. His ferocious form lurks in the tempest. Defying the hurricane  which bends the bamboos and uproots trees, he challenges the furies of  nature that are hostile to the expression of the universal soul. The  bamboo is the symbol of wisdom, the pine is the emblem of will-power and  life. The plum tree in flower is a harmonious combination of the two  principles. It symbolizes virginal purity.      [Illustration: PLATE V. PORTRAIT OF LUe TUNG-PING BY T'ENG CH'ANG-YU    T'ang Period. Collection of August Jaccaci. Lent to the Metropolitan    Museum, New York.]    Thus is built up a complete system of allusions similar to the allegories  of our own classics but superior in that they never degenerate into frozen  symbols, but on the contrary keep in close touch with nature, investing  her with a vibrant life, in which human consciousness vanishes making way  for the dawning consciousness of infinitude.    Buddhism goes still further. It does not even believe in the reality of  the world. In this belief, forms are but transitory, the universe an  illusion forever flowing into an unending future. Outside of the supreme  repose, in the six worlds of desire,[3] the things that are susceptible to  pain and death pursue their evolution. Souls travel this closed cycle  under the most diverse forms, from hell to the gods, advancing or  retreating, in accordance with the good deeds or errors committed in  previous existences. A stone, a plant, an insect, a demon, or a god are  only illusory forms, each encompassing an identical soul on its way to  deliverance, as it is caught at different stages of its long calvary and  imprisoned through original sin and the instinctive desire for life.  Whence we see emerging a new feeling of charity which embraces all beings.  Their moral character is felt to be the same as that of man, their goal is  the same, and in the vast world of illusion each seeks to fulfill the same  destiny.      [3] These are: the worlds of animals, of man, of gods or _devas_, of    giants or _asuras_, of _pretas_ or wandering spirits, and of hells.    Freedom from perpetual transmigration in these six worlds is attained    only through the extinction of desire.    Behind the changes of the universe the Buddhist perceives the primal  substance that pervades all creation. There results from this an intimacy  with things which exists in no other creed. From inert matter to the most  highly organized being, all creation is thus endowed with a sense of  kinship that is destined to make a"]]]
