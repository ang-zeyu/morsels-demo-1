The Committee was responsible for book selection, carried out mainly  during the session. While control over the Library in the recess lay  with representatives of the House and Council, from the first H. F.  Carleton, Chairman of Committees of the House, and a classical scholar,  was responsible for seeing the books were obtained and that the funds  were expended.    Until 1861 the only assistance in the Library was provided by a  sessional messenger, but a full-time sub-librarian was provided from  1862. When Parliament moved to Wellington different arrangements were  necessary and in 1866 the Committee suggested that a permanent  librarian should be appointed. It was thought necessary to have  somebody for the custody of a collection increasing in value from year  to year. The House disagreed with this view, but perhaps with the hope  of making the way clear for such appointment Major Campbell had given  up his responsibility for the Library.    This left a gap which appears to have been filled by the Hon. Alfred  Domett. As in addition to being a Legislative Councillor, he was  Secretary for Crown Lands, Land Claims Commissioner, and Registrar-General  he cannot have been able to spend much time with the Library. For all  that, his influence was considerable and Gisborne, in his book _New  Zealand Rulers and Statesmen_, says \"He was for many years the mainstay  of the General Assembly Library. He was, it may be said, the father of  that institution; and it is mainly owing to his love of literature, and  to his great ability in the organisation and classification of a  library that the success of the institution with comparatively small  means was so marked at the date of his departure from the Colony in  1871.\"    Just how long he was Librarian is not clear, but probably with the  library attendant and additional assistance during the session there  was sufficient staff to carry out all the work. It was not until 1875  that Ewen McColl, the attendant, became Sub-Librarian, though it is  possible he may have been in fact Librarian as early as 1871.                                    1870-1900    The last 30 years of the nineteenth century were spent by the Library  Committee in enlarging the Library and in trying to obtain an adequate  and suitable building to house it. The vote was raised to L300 in 1867  and L600 in 1874, while in addition the adoption of a new standing  order for Private Bills in 1870 gave the fees up to L25 for a Bill that  passed both Houses to the Library fund. Fines levied on members were  also devoted to the Library fund, though this has never been a  lucrative source. Among others, the fine of L75 imposed on Mr Lusk was  received in 1875, and a similar sum from the Hon. Mr Robinson, but the  historic fine of L500 inflicted on the manager of the Bank of New  Zealand in 1896 was never received.    Private Bill fees varied from nothing to L150, so that the income was  between L650 and L750. The money was not spent on books only, but  included expenditure on binding, periodicals, and on insurance. In the  eighties and early nineties insurance premiums on the collection housed  in a wooden building were L100 per annum and, though they were reduced,  even in the last years of the century, L40 had to be used for this  purpose.    Even so the Library stock was increasing annually by some 1,400  volumes. In 1871 there were 8,330 volumes, in 1877, 14,580. Five years  later the figure had increased to 21,000, and to 30,000 in 1887,  reaching 52,000 in 1902. Most of the growth was due to purchase, but  the Library had many friends, especially among members, and they were  most generous. Their gifts filled gaps specially in New Zealand  material, while others gave books of value on subjects not of great  interest to Parliament. Among such donors were Carleton, Mantell, and  Sheehan, to mention only a few.    The Library had other friends who were no less helpful. New Zealand was  represented at the Philadelphia Centenary Exhibition in 1876 by Dr  Hector. He made arrangements with the Smithsonian Institution in  Washington for the General Assembly Library to receive United States  Government papers and for New Zealand in turn to supply New Zealand  official publications to the Institution. This was the Library's first  large exchange agreement and, while the material received under it has  often threatened to swamp it, very many valuable items have been added  from this source.    The overtures to the British Government first made in 1858 do not  finally seem to have succeeded until 1883. In this year Lord Derby in a  circular dispatch to all colonies offered to exchange British official  papers for those of the colonies to be sent to the British Museum. The  Library Committee jumped at the offer; it had since 1874 been buying  sets of parliamentary papers and immediately approached the Cabinet to  authorise that New Zealand publications should be sent. As a result the  Library possesses an extremely valuable and still growing collection of  British official papers.    The Library was in addition receiving New Zealand newspapers and  publications of all kinds and it had other exchange arrangements with  Canada and the Australian States. Until 1884, 81 newspapers were being  bound regularly out of 153 received, but in this year because of the  lack of space and the expense the number was reduced to 24. For all  this the Library was adding to its holdings of newspapers at a fairly  rapid rate.    The increase in the number of books necessitated an increase in storage  space. The first attempt was made in 1869 when a motion was brought  before both Houses asking that the Library building should be added to  in order to provide additional room. The matter was deferred until a  general enlargement of the buildings took place. This was done in the  recess of 1872-73, and the Library was given the old smoking room, but  only after a division when an attempt to have a proper building for the  Library had been defeated.    There was genuine concern on the part of the Committee for the safety  of the Library. In 1875 the building caught fire which was only put out  by the efforts of members. Two days later the Committee passed a motion  stating that the time had come when the erection of a proper Library  building could no longer be delayed. Sir George Grey was asked to move  the motion in the House. This was passed and a Royal Commission set up  to superintend the construction, L5,000 being voted in the Estimates  for the job, which it was thought would take two years and cost  L14,000.    Nothing was done before the session of 1876 and the Committee set to  work again. Several resolutions concerning the Library, its location,  and the calling of competitive designs were passed, but though the  Government proposed to put L7,000 on the estimates towards a Library,  it was not done. The resolutions seem to have confused rather than  helped the situation.    The session of 1877 began with no further progress. To the Joint  Committee's requests for information the Minister of Public Works  replied that no designs had been settled on and in any case competitive  designs would involve reconstruction of the whole block. More debate  ensued and finally the sum of L2,500 was placed on the Estimates and a  second Royal Commission set up to superintend the erection of the  building. The money was not voted, however, and the Commission did not  meet.    The Library now occupied three rooms, with a further office for the  Librarian, but the growth was continuous. Two more rooms were taken  over from the Legislative Council in 1881 and temporarily the Library  could shelve all its books.    No success had rewarded the Committee's desire for new buildings in the  seventies, but in 1882 it seemed that luck was in its way. L20,000 was  placed on the Estimates for the partial reconstruction of the buildings  which were to include a new Bellamy's as well as a new Library. Only  L10,000 was voted, however, and this was spent on Bellamy's. The new  building had a bad effect on the Library, cutting off the sun and  making it damp, though the Committee had a consolation prize, receiving  the old Bellamy's for book storage.    So the matter dragged on. In 1886, on the initiative of the Premier,  L5,000 was voted for a new building, plans were prepared as quickly as  possible and tenders called, but none was accepted before the end of  the financial year so the vote lapsed.    By now the Committee seems to have been almost reconciled to the fact  that there was little immediate chance of a Library being erected.  Frequent requests were however made for something to be done and the  slightest possibility of a surplus in the Consolidated Fund always  raised hopes. Assurances were frequent that Cabinet was worried about  the housing of the Library, and whenever possible an extra room was  given.    In 1885 the Library was located in six rooms, some remote. More were  given later, though some were taken away. In 1892 the Librarian  reported that the building \"simply cannot any longer accommodate the  books\". But it was to be nearly 10 years before the new building was to  be ready for storing books.    The situation was indeed growing more and more desperate. Many books,  particularly old novels and duplicate periodicals, were given away to  hospitals and libraries, and files of newspapers were no longer  preserved, while much of the Library stock could only be located with  difficulty. In 1897 the Library was spread all over the building with  many of the rooms outside the control of the Librarian. Books were  stored in two Ministers' rooms, the ladies' tearoom, and two committee  rooms. A motion was brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#3)"],[1," at  Commandant-General Joubert's offices. The ante-chamber leading to the  Generalissimo's \"sanctum-sanctorum\" was crowded with brilliantly-uniformed  officers of our State Artillery, and it was only by dint of using my  elbows very vigorously that I gained admission to my chief-in-command.    The old General seemed to feel keenly the gravity of the situation. He  looked careworn and troubled: \"Good-morning, Commandant,\" he said;  \"aren't you away yet?\"    I explained that I was on my way to the railway station, but I thought  before I left I'd like to see him about one or two things.    \"Well, go on, what is it?\" General Joubert enquired, petulantly.    \"I want to know, General Joubert,\" I said, \"whether England has  declared war against us, or whether we are taking the lead. And  another thing, what sort of general have I to report myself to at  Volksrust?\"    The old warrior, without looking up or immediately answering me, drew  various cryptic and hieroglyphic pothooks and figures on the paper  before him. Then he suddenly lifted his eyes and pierced me with a  look, at which I quailed and trembled.    He said very slowly: \"Look here; there is as yet no declaration of  war, and hostilities have not yet commenced. You and my other officers  should understand that very clearly, because possibly the differences  between ourselves and Great Britain may still be settled. We are only  going to occupy our frontiers because England's attitude is extremely  provocative, and if England see that we are fully prepared and that we  do not fear her threats, she will perhaps be wise in time and  reconsider the situation. We also want to place ourselves in a  position to prevent and quell a repetition of the Jameson Raid with  more force than we exerted in 1896.\"    An hour afterwards I was on board a train travelling to Johannesburg  in the company of General Piet Cronje and his faithful wife. General  Cronje told me that he was proceeding to the western districts of the  Republic to take up the command of the Potchefstroom and Lichtenburg  burghers. His instructions, he said, were to protect the Western  frontier.    I left General Cronje at Johannesburg on the 29th September, 1899, and  never saw him again until I met him at St. Helena nearly two and a  half years afterwards, on the 25th March, 1902. When I last saw him we  greeted each other as free men, as free and independent legislators  and officers of a free Republic. We fought for our rights to live as a  nation.    Now I meet the veteran Cronje a broken old man, captive like myself,  far away from our homes and our country.    Then and Now!    Then we went abroad free and freedom-loving men, burning with  patriotism. Our wives and our women-folk watched us go; full of sorrow  and anxiety, but satisfied that we were going abroad in our country's  cause.    And Now!    Two promising and prosperous Republics wrecked, their fair homesteads  destroyed, their people in mourning, and thousands of innocent women  and children the victims of a cruel war.    There is scarcely an Afrikander family without an unhealable wound.  Everywhere the traces of the bloody struggle; and, alas, most poignant  and distressing fact of all, burghers who fought side by side with us  in the earlier stages of the struggle are now to be found in the ranks  of the enemy.    These wretched men, ignoring their solemn duty, left their companions  in the lurch without sense of shame or respect for the braves who fell  fighting for their land and people.    Oh, day of judgment! The Afrikander nation will yet avenge your  treachery.          CHAPTER III.    THE INVASION OF NATAL.      After taking leave of my friend Cronje at Johannesburg Station, my  first duty was to visit my various field cornets. About four o'clock  that afternoon I found my commando was as nearly ready as could be  expected. When I say ready, I mean ready on paper only, as later  experience showed. My three field cornets were required to equip 900  mounted men with waggons and provisions, and of course they had _carte  blanche_ to commandeer. Only fully enfranchised burghers of the South  African Republic were liable to be commandeered, and in Johannesburg  town there was an extraordinary conglomeration of cosmopolitans  amenable to this gentle process of enlistment.    It would take up too much time to adequately describe the excitement  of Johannesburg on this memorable day. Thousands of Uitlanders were  flying from their homes, contenting themselves, in their hurry to get  away, to stand in Kaffir or coal trucks and to expose themselves  cheerfully to the fierce sun, and other elements. The streets were  palpitating with burghers ready to proceed to the frontier that night,  and with refugees speeding to the stations. Everybody was in a state  of intense feeling. One was half-hearted, another cheerful, and a  third thirsting for blood, while many of my men were under the  influence of alcohol.    When it was known that I had arrived in the town my room in the North  Western Hotel was besieged. I was approached by all sorts of people  pleading exemption from commando duty. One Boer said he knew that his  solemn duty was to fight for his country and his freedom, but he would  rather decline. Another declared that he could not desert his family;  while yet another came forward with a story that of his four horses,  three had been commandeered, and that these horses were his only means  of subsistence. A fourth complained that his waggons and mules had  been clandestinely (although officially) removed. Many malingerers  suddenly discovered acute symptoms of heart disease and brought  easily-obtained doctor's certificates, assuring me that tragic  consequences would attend their exposure in the field. Ladies came to  me pleading exemption for their husbands, sisters for brothers,  mothers for sons, all offering plausible reasons why their loved ones  should be exempted from commando duty. It was very difficult to deal  with all these clamorous visitors. I was much in the position of King  Solomon, though lacking his wisdom. But I would venture to say that  his ancient majesty himself would have been perplexed had he been in  my place. It is necessary that the reader should know that the main  part of the population was composed of all nationalities and lacked  every element of Boer discipline.    On the evening of the 29th of September, I left with the Johannesburg  commando in two trains. Two-thirds of my men had no personal  acquaintance with me, and at the departure there was some difficulty  because of this. One burgher came into my private compartment  uninvited. He evidently forgot his proper place, and when I suggested  to him that the compartment was private and reserved for officers, he  told me to go to the devil, and I was compelled to remove him somewhat  precipitately from the carriage. This same man was afterwards one of  my most trustworthy scouts.    The following afternoon we reached Standerton, where I received  telegraphic instructions from General Joubert to join my commando to  that of Captain Schiel, who was in charge of the German Corps, and to  place myself under the supreme command of Jan Kock, a member of the  Executive Council, who had been appointed a general by the Government.    We soon discovered that quite one-third of the horses we had taken  with us were untrained for the serious business of fighting, and also  that many of the new burghers of foreign nationality had not the  slightest idea how to ride. Our first parade, or \"Wapenschouwing\"  gave food for much hilarity. Here one saw horses waltzing and jumping,  while over there a rider was biting the sand, and towards evening the  doctors had several patients. It may be stated that although not  perfectly equipped in the matter of ambulances, we had three  physicians with us, Doctors Visser, Marais, and Shaw. Our spiritual  welfare was being looked after by the Reverends Nel and Martins, but  not for long, as both these gentlemen quickly found that commando life  was unpleasant and left us spiritually to ourselves, even as the  European Powers left us politically. But I venture to state that no  member of my commando really felt acutely the loss of the theological  gentlemen who primarily accompanied us.    [Illustration: The Capture of the Train at Elandslaagte.]    On the following day General Kock and a large staff arrived at the  laager, and, together with the German Corps, we trekked to Paardekop  and Klip River, in the Orange Free State, where we were to occupy  Botha's Pass. My convoy comprised about a hundred carts, mostly drawn  by mules, and it was amusing to see the variety of provisions my  worthy field-cornets had gathered together. There were three full  waggons of lime-juice and other unnecessary articles which I caused to  be unloaded at the first halting-place to make room for more  serviceable provisions. It should be mentioned that of my three  field-cornets only one, the late Piet Joubert of Jeppestown, actually  accompanied my commando. The others sent substitutes, perhaps because  they did not like to expose themselves to the change of air. We rested  some days at the Klip River, in the Orange Free State, and from thence  I was sent with a small escort of burghers by our General to  Harrismith to meet a number of Free State officers. After travelling  two days I came upon Chief Free State Commandant Prinsloo, who  afterwards deserted, and other officers. The object of my mission was  to organise communications with these officers. On the 11th of  October, having returned to my commando, we received a report that our  Government had despatched the Ultimatum to England, and that the time  specified for the reply to that document had elapsed. Hostilities had  begun.    We received orders to invade Natal, and crossed the frontier that very  evening. I, with a patrol of 50 men, had not crossed the frontier very  far when"]]]
