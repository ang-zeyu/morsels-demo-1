And you both can soon return to Erin of the Streams, but I  shall not see it till three hundred years have passed away, for I am  Liban the Mermaid, daughter of a line of kings. But I may not keep you  here. The Fairy Queen is waiting for you in her snow-white palace and  her fragrant bowers. And now kiss me once more, Nora, and kiss me,  Connla.  May luck and joy go with you, and all gentleness be upon you  both.\"[1]    Then the children said good-by to the mermaid, and the rocks opened for  them and they passed through, and soon they found themselves in a meadow  starred with flowers, and through the meadow sped a sunlit stream. They  followed the stream until it led them into a garden of roses, and beyond  the garden, standing on a gentle hill, was a palace white as snow.  Before the palace was a crowd of fairy maidens pelting each other with  rose-leaves. But when they saw the children they gave over their play,  and came trooping towards them.    \"Our queen is waiting for you,\" they said; and then they led the  children to the palace door. The children entered, and after passing  through a long corridor they found themselves in a crystal hall so like  the one they had seen in the mountain of the golden spear that they  thought it was the same. But on all the crystal couches fairies, dressed  in silken robes of many colors, were sitting, and at the end of the  hall, on a crystal throne, was seated the fairy queen, looking lovelier  than the evening star. The queen descended from her throne to meet  the children, and taking them by the hands, she led them up the shining  steps. Then, sitting down, she made them sit beside her, Connla on her  right hand and Nora on her left.    Then she ordered the nine little pipers to come before her, and she said  to them:    \"So far you have done your duty faithfully, and now play one more sweet  air and your task is done.\"    And the little pipers played, and from the couches at the first sound of  the music all the fairies rose, and forming partners, they danced over  the crystal floor as lightly as the young leaves dancing in the wind.    Listening to the fairy music, and watching the wavy motion of the  dancing fairies, the children fell asleep. When they awoke next morning  and rose from their silken beds they were no longer children. Nora was a  graceful and stately maiden, and Connla a handsome and gallant youth.  They looked at each other for a moment in surprise, and then Connla  said:    \"Oh, Nora, how tall and beautiful you are!\"    \"Oh, not so tall and handsome as you are, Connla,\" said Nora, as she  flung her white arms round his neck and kissed her brother's lips.    Then they drew back to get a better look of each other, and who should  step between them but the fairy queen.    \"Oh, Nora, Nora,\" said she, \"I am not as high as your knee, and as for  you, Connla, you look as straight and as tall as one of the round towers  of Erin.\"    \"And how did we grow so tall in one night?\" said Connla.    \"In one night!\" said the fairy queen. \"One night, indeed! Why, you have  been fast asleep, the two of you, for the last seven years!\"    \"And where was the little mother all that time?\" said Connla and Nora  together.    \"Oh, the little mother was all right. She knew where you were; but she  is expecting you to-day, and so you must go off to see her, although  I would like to keep you--if I had my way--all to myself here in the  fairyland under the sea. And you will see her to-day; but before you go  here is a necklace for you, Nora; it is formed out of the drops of the  ocean spray, sparkling in the sunshine. They were caught by my fairy  nymphs, for you, as they skimmed the sunlit billows under the shape of  sea-birds, and no queen or princess in the world can match their luster  with the diamonds won with toil from the caves of earth. As for you,  Connla, see here's a helmet of shining gold fit for a king of Erin--and  a king of Erin you will be yet; and here's a spear that will pierce any  shield, and here's a shield that no spear can pierce and no sword can  cleave as long as you fasten your warrior cloak with this brooch of  gold.\"    And as she spoke she flung round Connla's shoulders a flowing mantle of  yellow silk, and pinned it at his neck with a red gold brooch.    \"And now, my children, you must go away from me. You, Nora, will be a  warrior's bride in Erin of the Streams. And you, Connla, will be king  yet over the loveliest province in all the land of Erin; but you will  have to fight for your crown, and days of battle are before you. They  will not come for a long time after you have left the fairyland under  the sea, and until they come lay aside your helmet, shield, and spear,  and warrior's cloak and golden brooch. But when the time comes when you  will be called to battle, enter not upon it without the golden brooch  I give you fastened in your cloak, for if you do harm will come to you.  Now, kiss me, children; your little mother is waiting for you at the  foot of the golden spear, but do not forget to say good-by to Liban the  Mermaid, exiled from the land she loves, and pining in sadness beneath  the sea.\"    Connla and Nora kissed the fairy queen, and Connla, wearing his golden  helmet and silken cloak, and carrying his shield and spear, led Nora  with him. They passed from the palace through the garden of roses,  through the flowery meadow, through the dark gray rocks, until they  reached the golden strand; and there, sitting and singing the strange,  sweet song, was Liban the Mermaid.    \"And so you are going up to Erin,\" she said, \"up through the covering  waters. Kiss me, children, once again; and when you are in Erin of the  Streams, sometimes think of the exile from Erin beneath the sea.\"    And the children kissed the mermaid, and with sad hearts, bidding her  good-by, they walked along the golden strand. When they had gone what  seemed to them a long way, they began to feel weary; and just then  they saw coming towards them a little man in a red jacket leading  a coal-black steed.    When they met the little man, he said: \"Connla, put Nora up on this  steed; then jump up before her.\"    Connla did as he was told, and when both of them were mounted--    \"Now, Connla,\" said the little man, \"catch the bridle in your hands,  and you, Nora, clasp Connla round the waist, and close your eyes.\"    They did as they were bidden, and then the little man said, \"Swash,  swish!\" and the steed shot up from the strand like a lark from the  grass, and pierced the covering sea, and went bounding on over the  level waters; and when his hoofs struck the hard ground, Connla and  Nora opened their eyes, and they saw that they were galloping towards  a shady wood.    On went the steed, and soon he was galloping beneath the branches that  almost touched Connla's head. And on they went until they had passed  through the wood, and then they saw rising up before them the \"Golden  Spear.\"    \"Oh, Connla,\" said Nora, \"we are at home at last.\"    \"Yes,\" said Connla, \"but where is the little house under the hill?\"    And no little house was there; but in its stead was standing a  lime-white mansion.    \"What can this mean?\" said Nora.    But before Connla could reply, the steed had galloped up to the door  of the mansion, and, in the twinkling of an eye, Connla and Nora were  standing on the ground outside the door, and the steed had vanished.    Before they could recover from their surprise the little mother came  rushing out to them, and flung her arms around their necks, and kissed  them both again and again.    \"Oh, children! children! You are welcome home to me; for though I knew  it was all for the best, my heart was lonely without you.\"    And Connla and Nora caught up the little mother in their arms, and they  carried her into the hall and set her down on the floor.    \"Oh, Nora!\" said the little mother, \"you are a head over me; and as for  you, Connla, you look almost as tall as one of the round towers of Erin.\"    \"That's what the fairy queen said, mother,\" said Nora.    \"Blessings on the fairy queen,\" said the little mother. \"Turn round,  Connla, till I look at you.\"    Connla turned round, and the little mother said:    \"Oh, Connla, with your golden helmet and your spear, and your glancing  shield, and your silken cloak, you look like a king. But take them off,  my boy, beautiful as they are. Your little mother would like to see you,  her own brave boy, without any fairy finery.\"    And Connla laid aside his spear and shield, and took off his golden  helmet and his silken cloak. Then he caught the little mother and kissed  her, and lifted her up until she was as high as his head. And said he:    \"Don't you know, little mother, I'd rather have you than all the world.\"    And that night, when they were sitting down by the fire together, you  may be sure that in the whole world no people were half as happy as  Nora, Connla, and the little mother.          THE HOUSE IN THE LAKE[2]      A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut, in the midst of one  of the inland lakes of Erin, an old fisherman and his son. The hut was  built on stakes driven into the bed of the lake, and was so high above  the waters that even when they were stirred into waves by the wind  coming down from the mountains they did not reach the threshold of the  door. Around, outside the hut, on a level with the floor, was a little  wicker-work platform, and under the platform, close to the steps leading  up to it from the water, the fisherman's curragh, made of willows,  covered with skins, was moored, and it was only by means of the curragh  that he and his son, Enda, could leave their lake dwelling.    On many a summer evening Enda lay stretched on the platform, watching  the sunset fading from the mountain-tops, and the twilight creeping over  the waters of the lake, and it chanced that once when he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#3)"],[1," built their capabilities  for plunder must have been realized. The filibustering expedition of  Jason and the loot of the Golden Fleece is an early instance, and the  Greeks at all times have distinguished themselves by acting up to  Jason's example by sea and land. The Moslems, however, were some time  in accustoming themselves to the perils of the deep. At first they  marvelled greatly at \"those that go down to the sea in ships, and have  their business in great waters,\" but they did not hasten to follow  them. In the early days of the conquest of Egypt the Khalif 'Omar  wrote to his general and asked him what the sea was like, to which  'Amr made answer: \"The Sea is a huge beast which silly folk ride like  worms on logs;\" whereupon, much distressed, the prudent Khalif gave  orders that no Moslem should voyage on so unruly an element without  his leave. But it soon became clear that if the Moslems were to hold  their own with their neighbours (still more if they meant to hold  their neighbours' own) they must learn how to navigate; and  accordingly, in the first century of the Hijra, we find the Khalif  'Abd-el-Melik instructing his lieutenant in Africa to use Tunis as an  arsenal and dockyard, and there to collect a fleet. From that time  forward the Mohammedan rulers of the Barbary coast were never long  without ships of some sort. The Aghlab[=i] princes sailed forth from  Tunis, and took Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. The F[=a]tim[=i]  Khalifs waged war with the navies of 'Abd-er-Rahm[=a]n, the Great  Khalif of Cordova, at a strength of two hundred vessels a side. The  Almohades possessed a large and capacious fleet, in which they  transported their armies to Spain, and their successors in North  Africa, though less powerful, were generally able to keep up a number  of vessels for offensive as well as commercial purposes.    During the later Middle Ages the relations between the rulers of the  Barbary coast--the kings of Tunis, Tilims[=a]n, Fez, &c.--and the  trading nations of Christendom were amicable and just. Treaties show  that both parties agreed in denouncing and (so far as they could)  suppressing piracy and encouraging mutual commerce. It was not till  the beginning of the sixteenth century that a change came over these  peaceful conditions, and the way it happened was this.    When the united wisdom of Ferdinand and Isabella resolved on the  expatriation of the Spanish Moors, they forgot the risk of an exile's  vengeance.[1] No sooner was Granada fallen than thousands of desperate  Moors left the land which for seven hundred years had been their home,  and, disdaining to live under a Spanish yoke, crossed the strait to  Africa, where they established themselves at various strong points,  such as Shersh[=e]l, Oran, and notably at Algiers, which till then had  hardly been heard of. No sooner were the banished Moors fairly settled  in their new seats than they did what anybody in their place would  have done: they carried the war into their oppressors' country. To  meet the Spaniards in the open field was impossible in their reduced  numbers, but at sea their fleetness and knowledge of the coasts gave  them the opportunity of reprisal for which they longed.    Science, tradition, and observation inform us that primitive man had  certain affinities to the beast of prey. By superior strength or  ingenuity he slew or snared the means of subsistence. Civilized man  leaves the coarsest forms of slaughter to a professional class, and,  if he kills at all, elevates his pastime to the rank of sport by the  refining element of skill and the excitement of uncertainty and  personal risk. But civilized man is still only too prone to prey upon  his fellows, though hardly in the brutal manner of his ancestors. He  preys upon inferior intelligence, upon weakness of character, upon the  greed and upon the gambling instinct of mankind. In the grandest scale  he is called a financier; in the meanest, a pickpocket. This predatory  spirit is at once so ancient and so general, that the reader, who is,  of course, wholly innocent of such reprehensible tendencies, must  nevertheless make an effort to understand the delights of robbery  considered as a fine art. Some cynics there are who will tell us that  the only reason we are not all thieves is because we have not pluck  enough; and there must certainly be some fascination, apart from  natural depravity or original sin, to make a man prefer to run  countless risks in an unlawful pursuit sooner than do an honest day's  work. And in this sentence we have the answer: It is precisely the  risk, the uncertainty, the danger, the sense of superior skill and  ingenuity, that attract the adventurous spirit, the passion for sport,  which is implanted in the vast majority of mankind.    Our Moorish robbers had all this, and more, to attract them. Brave and  daring men they had shown themselves often before in their tussles  with the Spaniards, or in their wild sea courses and harryings of  Christian shores, in Sardinia, perhaps, or Provence; but now they  pursued a quest alluring beyond any that had gone before, a righteous  vengeance upon those who had banished them from house and home, and  cast them adrift to find what new anchorage they might in the world--a  Holy War against the slaughterers of their kith and kin, and the  blasphemers of their sacred Faith. What joy more fierce and jubilant  than to run the light brigantine down the beach of Algiers and man her  for a cruise in Spanish waters? The little ship will hold but ten oars  a side, each pulled by a man who knows how to fight as well as to  row--as indeed he must, for there is no room for mere landsmen on  board a _firkata_. But if there be a fair wind off the land, there  will be little rowing; the big lateen sail on her one mast will span  the narrow waters between the African coast and the Balearic Isles,  where a convenient look-out may be kept for Spanish galleons or  perhaps an Italian polacca. Drawing little water, a small squadron of  brigantines could be pushed up almost any creek, or lie hidden behind  a rock, till the enemy hove in sight. Then oars out, and a quick  stroke for a few minutes, and they are alongside their unsuspecting  prey, and pouring in their first volley. Then a scramble on board, a  hand-to-hand scuffle, a last desperate resistance on the poop, under  the captain's canopy, and the prize is taken, the prisoners ironed, a  jury crew sent on board, and all return in triumph to Algiers, where  they are received with acclamations.    Or it might be a descent on the shores of their own beloved Andalusia.  Then the little vessels are run into the crevices between the rocks,  or even buried in the sand, and the pirates steal inland to one of the  villages they know so well, and the loss of which they will never  cease to mourn. They have still friends a-many in Spain, who are  willing enough to help them against the oppressor and to hide them  when surprised. The sleeping Spaniards are roused and then grimly  silenced by the points of swords; their wives and daughters are borne  away on the shoulders of the invaders; everything valuable is cleared;  and the rovers are soon sailing merrily into the roads at Algiers,  laden with spoil and captives, and often with some of the persecuted  remnant of their race, who thankfully rejoin their kinsmen in the new  country. To wreak such vengeance on the Spaniard added a real zest to  life.    [Illustration: CARAVEL OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.    (_Jurien de la Graviere._)]    With all their skill and speed, their knowledge of the coasts, and the  help of their compatriots ashore, there was still the risk of capture.  Sometimes their brigantines \"caught a Tartar\" when they expected an  easy victim, and then the Moors found the tables turned, and had to  grace their captors' triumph, and for years, perhaps for ever, to sit  on the banks of a Venetian or Genoese galley, heavily chained, pulling  the infidel's oar even in the chase of the true believers, and gazing  to satiety upon the weals which the lash kept raw on the bare back of  the man in front. But the risk added a zest to the Corsair's life, and  the captive could often look forward to the hope of recapture, or  sometimes of ransom by his friends. The career of the pirate, with all  its chances, was a prosperous one. The adventurers grew rich, and  their strong places on the Barbary coast became populous and well  garrisoned; and, by the time the Spaniards began to awake to the  danger of letting such troublesome neighbours alone, the evil was past  a cure. For twenty years the exiled Moors had enjoyed immunity, while  the big Spanish galleys were obstinately held in port, contemptuous of  so small a foe. At last Don Pedro Navarro was despatched by Cardinal  Ximenes to bring the pirates to book. He had little difficulty in  taking possession of Oran and Buj[=e]ya; and Algiers was so  imperfectly fortified, that he imposed his own terms. He made the  Algerines vow to renounce piracy; and, to see that they kept their  word, he built and garrisoned a strong fort, the \"Penon de Alger,\"[2]  to stop their boats from sallying forth. But the Moors had still more  than one strong post on the rocky promontories of Barbary, and having  tasted the delights of chasing Spaniards, they were not likely to  reform, especially as the choice lay between piracy and starvation.  Dig they would not, and they preferred to beg by force, like the  \"gentlemen of the road.\" So they bided their time, till Ferdinand the  Catholic passed away to his account, and then, in defiance of the  Penon, and reckless of all the pains and penalties of Spanish  retribution, they threw up their allegiance, and looked about for  allies.    Help was not far off, though in this case it meant mastery. The day of  the Moorish pirates was over; henceforth they might, and did,  triumphantly assault and batter Spanish and Venetian ships, but they  "]]]
