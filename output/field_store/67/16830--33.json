You can see I'm  frozen! Be quick and give me the presents, and then get away to your  home.\" Then King Frost began to make the girl still colder. And he kept  making it colder and colder till he had frozen her through and through.    [Illustration]    Meanwhile her mother was saying to the old man at home: \"Go into the  forest now, and bring back my daughter. And mind, don't forget to take  the trunk and the fine clothes as well.\" So the old man started off, and  his wife began to watch at the window.    She waited and waited, and at last she saw her husband driving towards  home, and said to herself: \"That's all right, there comes the old man  bringing back my daughter all in silver and in gold.\"    [Illustration]    But the doggie outside said: \"Bow, wow, bow-wow-wow, the old man's  bringing back bones in his sledge!\" The old man drove up, and it was too  true, instead of the bad old woman's daughter there was only an icicle!    [Illustration]          THE BEAR'S PAW.    [Illustration]      One day a peasant saw a bear asleep in the forest, so he crept up to him  and cut off one of his hind paws with an axe. And he brought the paw  home, and said to his wife: \"Boil some soup from the flesh, and knit  some warm gloves out of the wool.\" So she took off the skin, threw the  flesh into the pot to boil, and sat down to spin the wool.    And when Bruin woke up, he found his paw gone. There was no help for  it, so he cut a bit of wood off a tree, hewed it, tied it on instead of  his leg, and set out for the village. As he went along he sang:    [Illustration]      \"Hobble, hobble, hobble,    On my lime-tree leg,    On my birchen crutch!    The water's asleep,    And the earth's asleep,    The whole village is asleep,    Only one woman's awake,    And she's boiling my flesh,    Sitting on my skin,    And spinning my wool!\"    [Illustration]    And the peasant's wife got very frightened, and hid as quick as she  could in the cellar under the floor. And Bruin went into the house, and  saw there was no one there. So he took his bit of skin, got his flesh  out of the pot and made off.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: May I?]          THE BEAR AND THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTERS.      There was once an old man and he had three little daughters, and one day  he said to them: \"I am going out into the fields to plough, and you, my  little daughters, bake me a loaf and bring it to me.\" \"But how are we to  find you, daddy?\" they said.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"As I go along,\" he said, \"I shall drop shavings in a row along the  path, and that will help you to find me.\" And as the old man rode along  he threw down the shavings one after the other, and a bear came and  drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Then the eldest daughter said to the youngest: \"Go and take the bread to  daddy.\" And the youngest said: \"But how am I to find daddy, and where am  I to take the bread to?\" Then the eldest answered: \"He kept dropping  shavings in a row along the path as he went.\" Then she took the loaf,  and started off to follow the shavings, when lo and behold! she came to  the bear's den.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! What a nice little girl has come  to see me!\"    [Illustration]    The next day the old man went off to sow, and he said to his daughters:  \"My dear little daughters, my clever little ones, bake me a loaf and  bring it to me in the field.\" \"But how are we to find you, daddy?\" they  said. And he answered: \"Yesterday I threw one row of shavings down,  to-day I will throw two.\" And he set off, throwing the shavings down in  two rows, and the bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that  led to his den. Then the second daughter started out with the loaf,  following the shavings, and went straight to the bear's den. And the  bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's another little girl come to see  me!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next day the old man went off to the field to harrow, and he said to  his daughter: \"My dear little daughter, bake me a loaf and bring it to  me in the field. I will throw three rows of shavings.\" And the old man  went off, throwing the shavings down in three rows, and the bear came  and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den. And the  eldest daughter set out, and she, too, came to the bear's den. And the  bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's a third little girl come to see me  in my den!\" And there they went on living, when one day the eldest  sister said: \"Bruin, Bruin, I'll bake some pies, and you take them and  give them to my daddy to eat.\" \"All right,\" answered the bear, \"I'll  take them.\" And so she popped her youngest sister into a sack, and  said: \"Here, Bruin, take this to my daddy, and mind, don't you eat it  yourself on the way!\" And the bear took the sack and set off with it to  the old man. And as he went along, he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I  sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the  youngest daughter in the sack heard him and said: \"Don't sit down on a  stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought that this  was the eldest sister, and said to himself: \"There now, fancy that! I've  come a long way, and yet she can still hear me!\" And he brought the  sack right up to the old man's courtyard, when the dogs all rushed out  and began to bark at him! So he flung down the sack and ran off home.  And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did they make you welcome, Bruin, and  give you nice things to eat?\" \"They didn't give me anything to eat,\" he  answered, \"but their welcome was loud enough.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next day the eldest sister said: \"Bruin, take my daddy some more  pies to eat!\" And she tied up her other sister in the sack, and the bear  put it on his back and carried it off into the village. And as he went  through the forest he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I sit down on a  stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the second daughter  said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't!  Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy that!  I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me, and tells me not to  eat a pie!\" And so he reached the old man's courtyard, and when the dogs  went for him that time, they all but worried him to death! So he flung  down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did  they welcome you warmly, Bruin, and give you plenty to eat?\" \"It was  _such_ a warm welcome, and they gave me so much to eat, that I shan't  forget it in a hurry!\" he answered.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And the next day the eldest girl said: \"I'll bake some more pies, and  you take them to my daddy for him to eat.\" And so she herself sat down  in the sack, and the bear carried her off. And as he carried her along  he kept saying to himself: \"Oh, I _should_ so like to sit down on a  stump, and I _should_ so like to eat one little pie!\" And the eldest  daughter said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump,  don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy  that! Look at the long way I've come, and yet she can still see and hear  me!\" And so he brought the sack to the old man, and then the dogs came  upon him and all but tore him in bits. And he ran off into the forest  without as much as looking round, and the old man began once more to  live with his three little daughters.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: I don't like what is nice, but what I like _is_ nice!]          THE STRAW OX.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife, and one day she  said to him: \"Make me a straw ox and smear him over with pitch.\" And he  asked: \"What for?\" And she answered: \"Do what I tell you! Never mind  what it's for--that's my business!\" So the old man made a straw ox and  smeared him over with pitch. Then his wife got ready in the early  morning and drove the ox to pasture. She sat down under a tree, and  began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh  green grass. Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on  spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick  wood, from out of the dark forest, a bear came running, and ran right up  against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And the ox  answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over  with pitch.\" Then the bear said: \"Well, if you're smeared over with  pitch, give me some to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered:  \"Take some!\" So the bear seized hold of the ox, when lo and behold! his  paw stuck in the pitch. And when he tried to free it with the other  paw, that one stuck too. Then he started gnawing with his teeth, and  they stuck too. He couldn't tear himself away anyhow. And the old woman  woke up and saw the bear stuck fast to the ox. So she ran home and  shouted to her husband: \"Come along quick, a bear has stuck fast to our  ox, hurry up and catch him!\" And he came along, took the bear, led him  home, and shut him up in the lumber room.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next day, as soon as the sun rose, the old woman again drove the ox  to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning  flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of  the field! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field!\" And  she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of  the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a wolf came running, and  ran right up against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And  the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-ol"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2347"],[0,"The Adventure of the Dying Detective (#3)"],[1,"to my work, Dr. Watson, but  this case is certainly exceptional.  I will come with you at once.\"    I remembered Holmes's injunction.    \"I have another appointment,\" said I.    \"Very good.  I will go alone.  I have a note of Mr. Holmes's address.  You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.\"    It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes's bedroom. For all  that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous  relief,  he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as  ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in  a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness  and lucidity.    \"Well, did you see him, Watson?\"    \"Yes; he is coming.\"    \"Admirable, Watson!  Admirable!  You are the best of messengers.\"    \"He wished to return with me.\"    \"That would never do, Watson.  That would be obviously impossible.  Did  he ask what ailed me?\"    \"I told him about the Chinese in the East End.\"    \"Exactly!  Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could.  You can now disappear from the scene.\"    \"I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.\"    \"Of course you must.  But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion  would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are  alone.  There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.\"    \"My dear Holmes!\"    \"I fear there is no alternative, Watson.  The room does not lend itself  to concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse  suspicion.  But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.\"  Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face.  \"There are the wheels, Watson.  Quick, man, if you love me!  And don't  budge, whatever happens--whatever happens, do you hear?  Don't speak!  Don't move!  Just listen with all your ears.\"  Then in an instant his  sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk  droned away into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.    From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard  the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the  bedroom door.  Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken  only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man.  I could  imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down  at the sufferer.  At last that strange hush was broken.    \"Holmes!\" he cried.  \"Holmes!\" in the insistent tone of one who awakens  a sleeper.  \"Can't you hear me, Holmes?\"  There was a rustling, as if  he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.    \"Is that you, Mr. Smith?\"  Holmes whispered.  \"I hardly dared hope that  you would come.\"    The other laughed.    \"I should imagine not,\" he said.  \"And yet, you see, I am here. Coals  of fire, Holmes--coals of fire!\"    \"It is very good of you--very noble of you.  I appreciate your special  knowledge.\"    Our visitor sniggered.    \"You do.  You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you  know what is the matter with you?\"    \"The same,\" said Holmes.    \"Ah!  You recognize the symptoms?\"    \"Only too well.\"    \"Well, I shouldn't be surprised, Holmes.  I shouldn't be surprised if  it WERE the same.  A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a  dead man on the fourth day--a strong, hearty young fellow.  It was  certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted  an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London--a disease,  too, of which I had made such a very special study.  Singular  coincidence, Holmes.  Very smart of you to notice it, but rather  uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect.\"    \"I knew that you did it.\"    \"Oh, you did, did you?  Well, you couldn't prove it, anyhow.  But what  do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then  crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble?  What sort of a  game is that--eh?\"    I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man.  \"Give me the  water!\" he gasped.    \"You're precious near your end, my friend, but I don't want you to go  till I have had a word with you.  That's why I give you water.  There,  don't slop it about!  That's right.  Can you understand what I say?\"    Holmes groaned.    \"Do what you can for me.  Let bygones be bygones,\" he whispered. \"I'll  put the words out of my head--I swear I will.  Only cure me, and I'll  forget it.\"    \"Forget what?\"    \"Well, about Victor Savage's death.  You as good as admitted just now  that you had done it.  I'll forget it.\"    \"You can forget it or remember it, just as you like.  I don't see you  in the witnessbox.  Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure  you.  It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died.  It's not him we are talking about.  It's you.\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"The fellow who came for me--I've forgotten his name--said that you  contracted it down in the East End among the sailors.\"    \"I could only account for it so.\"    \"You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not?  Think yourself  smart, don't you?  You came across someone who was smarter this time.  Now cast your mind back, Holmes.  Can you think of no other way you  could have got this thing?\"    \"I can't think.  My mind is gone.  For heaven's sake help me!\"    \"Yes, I will help you.  I'll help you to understand just where you are  and how you got there.  I'd like you to know before you die.\"    \"Give me something to ease my pain.\"    \"Painful, is it?  Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards  the end.  Takes you as cramp, I fancy.\"    \"Yes, yes; it is cramp.\"    \"Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow.  Listen now!  Can you remember  any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms  began?\"    \"No, no; nothing.\"    \"Think again.\"    \"I'm too ill to think.\"    \"Well, then, I'll help you.  Did anything come by post?\"    \"By post?\"    \"A box by chance?\"    \"I'm fainting--I'm gone!\"    \"Listen, Holmes!\"  There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying  man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my  hiding-place.  \"You must hear me.  You SHALL hear me.  Do you remember  a box--an ivory box?  It came on Wednesday.  You opened it--do you  remember?\"    \"Yes, yes, I opened it.  There was a sharp spring inside it. Some  joke--\"    \"It was no joke, as you will find to your cost.  You fool, you would  have it and you have got it.  Who asked you to cross my path?  If you  had left me alone I would not have hurt you.\"    \"I remember,\" Holmes gasped.  \"The spring!  It drew blood.  This  box--this on the table.\"    \"The very one, by George!  And it may as well leave the room in my  pocket.  There goes your last shred of evidence.  But you have the  truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed  you.  You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent  you to share it.  You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here  and I will watch you die.\"    Holmes's voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.    \"What is that?\" said Smith.  \"Turn up the gas?  Ah, the shadows begin  to fall, do they?  Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the  better.\" He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened.  \"Is  there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?\"    \"A match and a cigarette.\"    I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement.  He was speaking in his  natural voice--a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew.  There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in  silent amazement looking down at his companion.    \"What's the meaning of this?\" I heard him say at last in a dry, rasping  tone.    \"The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,\" said Holmes.  \"I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor  drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water.  But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome.  Ah, here ARE some  cigarettes.\"  I heard the striking of a match.  \"That is very much  better.  Halloa! halloa!  Do I hear the step of a friend?\"    There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton  appeared.    \"All is in order and this is your man,\" said Holmes.    The officer gave the usual cautions.    \"I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,\" he  concluded.    \"And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,\"  remarked my friend with a chuckle.  \"To save an invalid trouble,  Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by  turning up the gas.  By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the  right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove.  Thank you.  I would handle it gingerly if I were you.  Put it down  here. It may play its part in the trial.\"    There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron  and a cry of pain.    \"You'll only get yourself hurt,\" said the inspector.  \"Stand still,  will you?\"  There was the click of the closing handcuffs.    \"A nice trap!\" cried the high, snarling voice.  \"It will bring YOU into  the dock, Holmes, not me.  He asked me to come here to cure him.  I was  sorry for him and I came.  Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have  said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane  suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes.  My word is always as good  as yours.\"    \"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes.  \"I had totally forgotten him.  My dear  Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies.  To think that I should have  overlooked you!  I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since  I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the  cab below?  I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some  use at the station.    \"I never needed it more,\" said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a  glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet.  \""]]]
