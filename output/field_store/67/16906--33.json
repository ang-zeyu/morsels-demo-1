This is a short and efficacious way of fighting with distractions;  because those who endeavour directly to oppose them, irritate and  increase them; but by losing ourselves in the thought of a present God,  and suffering our thoughts to be drawn to Him, we combat them  indirectly, and without thinking of them, but in an effectual manner.  And here let me warn beginners not to run from one truth to another,  from one subject to another; but to keep themselves to one so long as  they feel a taste for it: this is the way to enter deeply into truths,  to taste them, and to have them impressed upon us. I say it is difficult  at first thus to retire within ourselves, because of the habits, which  are natural to us, of being taken up with the outside; but when we are a  little accustomed to it, it becomes exceedingly easy; both because we  have formed the habit of it, and because God, who only desires to  communicate Himself to us, sends us abundant grace, and an experimental  sense of His presence, which renders it easy.    Let us apply this method to the Lord's Prayer. We say \"Our Father,\"  thinking that God is within us, and will indeed be our Father. After  having pronounced this word _Father_, we remain a few moments in  silence, waiting for this heavenly Father to make known His will to us.  Then we ask this King of Glory _to reign_ within us, abandoning  ourselves to Him, that He may do it, and yielding to Him the right that  He has over us. If we feel here an inclination to peace and silence, we  should not continue, but remain thus so long as the condition may last;  after which we proceed to the second petition, \"Thy will be done on  earth, as it is in heaven.\" We then desire that God may accomplish, in  us and by us, all His will; we give up to God our heart and our liberty,  that He may dispose of them at His pleasure. Then, seeing that the  occupation of the will should be love, we desire to love, and we ask God  to give us _His love_. But all this is done quietly, peacefully; and so  on with the rest of the prayer.    At other times we hold ourselves in the position of sheep near to the  Shepherd, asking of Him our true food. O Divine Shepherd! Thou feedest  Thy sheep with Thine own hand, and Thou art their food from day to day.  We may also bring before Him our family desires; but it must all be done  with the remembrance by faith of the presence of God within us.    We can form no imagination of what God is: a lively faith in His  presence is sufficient; for we can conceive no image of God, though we  may of Christ, regarding Him as crucified, or as a child, or in some  other condition, provided that we always seek Him within ourselves.    At other times we come to Him as to a Physician, bringing our maladies  to Him that He may heal them; but always without effort, with a short  silence from time to time, that the silence may be mingled with the  action, gradually lengthening the silence and shortening the spoken  prayer, until at length, as we yield to the operation of God, He gains  the supremacy. When the presence of God is given, and the soul begins to  taste of silence and repose, this experimental sense of the presence of  God introduces it to the second degree of prayer.          CHAPTER III.    SECOND DEGREE OF PRAYER, CALLED HERE \"THE PRAYER OF SIMPLICITY.\"      The second degree has been variously termed _Contemplation_, _The Prayer  of Silence_, and _of repose_; while others again have called it the  _Prayer of Simplicity_; and it is of this last term that I shall make  use here, being more appropriate than that of _Contemplation_, which  signifies a degree of prayer more advanced than that of which I speak.    After a time, as I have said, the soul becomes sensible of a facility in  recognising the presence of God; it collects itself more easily; prayer  becomes natural and pleasant; it knows that it leads to God; and it  perceives the smell of His perfumes.    Then it must change its method, and observe carefully what I am about to  say, without being astonished at its apparent implausibility.    First of all, when you bring yourself into the presence of God by faith,  remain a short time in an attitude of respectful silence. If from the  beginning, in making this act of faith, you are sensible of a little  taste of the presence of God, remain as you are without troubling  yourself on any subject, and keep that which has been given you, so long  as it may remain.    If it leaves you, excite your will by means of some tender affection,  and if you then find that your former state of peace has returned,  remain in it. The fire must be blown softly, and as soon as it is  lighted, cease to blow it, or you will put it out. It is also necessary  that you should go to God, not so much to obtain something from Him, as  to please Him, and to do His will; for a servant who only serves his  master in proportion to the recompense he receives, is unworthy of any  remuneration.    Go, then, to prayer, not only to enjoy God, but to be as He wills: this  will keep you equal in times of barrenness and in times of abundance;  and you will not be dismayed by the repulses of God, nor by His apparent  indifference.          CHAPTER IV.    ON SPIRITUAL DRYNESS.      As God's only desire is to give Himself to the loving soul who desires  to seek Him, He often hides Himself in order to arouse it, and compel it  to seek Him with love and fidelity. But how does He reward the  faithfulness of His beloved! And how are His apparent flights followed  by loving caresses!    The soul imagines that it is a proof of its fidelity and of its  increased love that it seeks God with an effort, or that at least such  seeking will soon lead to His return.    But no! This is not the way in this degree. With a loving impatience,  with deep humility and abasement, with an affection deep and yet  restful, with a respectful silence, you must await the return of your  Beloved.    You will thus show Him that it is _Himself_ alone that you love, and His  good pleasure, and not the pleasure that you find in loving Him.  Therefore it is said, \"Make not haste in time of trouble. Cleave unto  Him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end\"  (Ecclus. ii. 2, 3). Suffer the suspensions and the delays of the visible  consolations of God.    Be patient in prayer, even though you should do nothing all your life  but wait in patience, with a heart humbled, abandoned, resigned, and  content for the return of your Beloved. Oh, excellent prayer! How it  moves the heart of God, and obliges Him to return more than anything  else!          CHAPTER V.    ABANDONMENT TO GOD--ITS FRUIT AND ITS IRREVOCABILITY--IN WHAT IT  CONSISTS--GOD EXHORTS US TO IT.      It is here that true _abandonment_ and consecration to God should  commence, by our being deeply convinced that all which happens to us  moment by moment is the will of God, and therefore all that is necessary  to us.    This conviction will render us contented with everything, and will make  us see the commonest events in God, and not in the creature.    I beg of you, whoever you may be, who are desirous of giving yourselves  to God, not to take yourselves back when once you are given to Him, and  to remember that a thing once given away is no longer at your disposal.  _Abandonment_ is the key to the inner life: he who is thoroughly  abandoned will soon be perfect.    You must, then, hold firmly to your abandonment, without listening to  reason or to reflection. A great faith makes a great abandonment; you  must trust wholly in God, against hope believing in hope (Rom. iv. 18).  _Abandonment_ is the casting off of all care of ourselves, to leave  ourselves to be guided entirely by God.    All Christians are exhorted to abandonment, for it is said to all, \"Take  no thought for the morrow; for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have  need of all these things\" (Matt. vi. 32, 34). \"In all thy ways  acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths\" (Prov. iii. 6). \"Commit  thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established\" (Prov.  xvi. 3). \"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall  bring it to pass\" (Ps. xxxvii. 5).    Abandonment, then, ought to be an utter leaving of ourselves, both  outwardly and inwardly, in the hands of God, forgetting ourselves, and  thinking only of God. By this means the heart is kept always free and  contented.    Practically it should be a continual loss of our own will in the will  of God, a renunciation of all natural inclinations, however good they  may appear, in order that we may be left free to choose only as God  chooses: we should be indifferent to all things, whether temporal or  spiritual, for the body or the soul; leaving the past in forgetfulness,  the future to providence, and giving the present to God; contented with  the present moment, which brings with it God's eternal will for us;  attributing nothing which happens to us to the creature, but seeing all  things in God, and regarding them as coming infallibly from His hand,  with the exception only of our own sin.    Leave yourselves, then, to be guided by God as He will, whether as  regards the inner or the outward life.          CHAPTER VI.    OF SUFFERING WHICH MUST BE ACCEPTED AS FROM GOD--ITS FRUITS.      Be content with all the suffering that God may lay upon you. If you will  love Him purely, you will be as willing to follow Him to Calvary as to  Tabor.    He must be loved as much on Calvary as on Tabor, since it is there that  He makes the greatest manifestation of His love.    Do not act, then, like those people who give themselves at one time, and  take themselves back at another. They give themselves to be caressed,  and take themselves back when they are crucified; or else they seek for  consolation in the creature.    You can only find consolation in the love of the cross and in complete  abandonment.

The rate may be positive or negative.      _#_Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit  drugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,  and cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside medical channels.        Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,  Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),  hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).        Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush and the leaves contain the stimulant  cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa which comes from cacao  seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.        Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.        Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).        Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.        Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.        Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA,  STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues  (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).        Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).        Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.        Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).        Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and  thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and  hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or  Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and  others (Darvon, Lomotil).        Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.        Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.        Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried  opium poppy.        Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.        Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and  activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,  Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and  others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).      _#_Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one  year of age in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same  year.      _#_Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as  arable land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after  each harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent crops--land  cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest  (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently  used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--land under  dense or open stands of trees; and other--any land type not  specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The  percentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion of the entire  amount of land area that is artificially supplied with water.      _#_Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country  who represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not  involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head  of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day  activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief  of state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,  the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.      _#_Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived  by a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each  age remains constant in the future.      _#_Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of  literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most  common definition--the ability to read and write at a specified age.  Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the  ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.      _#_Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for  the foreseeable future.      _#_Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent  some national claims from being fully extended.      _#_Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All  commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which  excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.         Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory,  possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships  owned in the parent country. Also referred to as an offshore register,  the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive  register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local  variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation  rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive  register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned  abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience  register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.         Flag of convenience register--A national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.         Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which  holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home  or abroad. Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine  how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be  placed on the register.         Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of  a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by  foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state  (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International  Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most  notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental  in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in  attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.         Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight. Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately  restricted to commercial vessels only.         Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as  listed with the maritime authorities of a country. Also, the  compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of  a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws  of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the  nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.      _#_Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars  unless otherwise indicated.      _#_Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons  entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons  (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the  country is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000  population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net  emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).      _#_Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census  based on statistics from population censuses, vital registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on  assumptions about future trends.      _#_Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age.      _#_Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless  indicated as fiscal year (FY).      _#_Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from  material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence  Community estimates.
