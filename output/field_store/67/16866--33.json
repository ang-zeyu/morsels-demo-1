The forehead is high  and serious, and the hair, which one feels to be fine and thick and  fair, is drawn off it and lies close like a cap. The eyes are neither  large nor small, hazel probably, with a look at once shy and steady. A  pair of beautiful long hands are crossed below the lady's breast....    The chaplain of Kerfol, and other witnesses, averred that when the Baron  came back from Locronan he jumped from his horse, ordered another to  be instantly saddled, called to a young page to come with him, and  rode away that same evening to the south. His steward followed the next  morning with coffers laden on a pair of pack mules. The following week  Yves de Cornault rode back to Kerfol, sent for his vassals and tenants,  and told them he was to be married at All Saints to Anne de Barrigan of  Douarnenez. And on All Saints' Day the marriage took place.    As to the next few years, the evidence on both sides seems to show that  they passed happily for the couple. No one was found to say that Yves  de Cornault had been unkind to his wife, and it was plain to all that  he was content with his bargain. Indeed, it was admitted by the chaplain  and other witnesses for the prosecution that the young lady had a  softening influence on her husband, and that he became less exacting  with his tenants, less harsh to peasants and dependents, and less  subject to the fits of gloomy silence which had darkened his widowhood.  As to his wife, the only grievance her champions could call up in her  behalf was that Kerfol was a lonely place, and that when her husband was  away on business at Bennes or Morlaix--whither she was never taken--she  was not allowed so much as to walk in the park unaccompanied. But no  one asserted that she was unhappy, though one servant-woman said she  had surprised her crying, and had heard her say that she was a woman  accursed to have no child, and nothing in life to call her own. But  that was a natural enough feeling in a wife attached to her husband; and  certainly it must have been a great grief to Yves de Cornault that  she bore no son. Yet he never made her feel her childlessness as a  reproach--she admits this in her evidence--but seemed to try to make her  forget it by showering gifts and favours on her. Rich though he was, he  had never been openhanded; but nothing was too fine for his wife, in  the way of silks or gems or linen, or whatever else she fancied. Every  wandering merchant was welcome at Kerfol, and when the master was  called away he never came back without bringing his wife a handsome  present--something curious and particular--from Morlaix or Rennes  or Quimper. One of the waiting-women gave, in cross-examination, an  interesting list of one year's gifts, which I copy. From Morlaix, a  carved ivory junk, with Chinamen at the oars, that a strange sailor had  brought back as a votive offering for Notre Dame de la Clarte, above  Ploumanac'h; from Quimper, an embroidered gown, worked by the nuns of  the Assumption; from Rennes, a silver rose that opened and showed an  amber Virgin with a crown of garnets; from Morlaix, again, a length  of Damascus velvet shot with gold, bought of a Jew from Syria; and for  Michaelmas that same year, from Rennes, a necklet or bracelet of round  stones--emeralds and pearls and rubies--strung like beads on a fine gold  chain. This was the present that pleased the lady best, the woman said.  Later on, as it happened, it was produced at the trial, and appears to  have struck the Judges and the public as a curious and valuable jewel.    The very same winter, the Baron absented himself again, this time as far  as Bordeaux, and on his return he brought his wife something even odder  and prettier than the bracelet. It was a winter evening when he rode up  to Kerfol and, walking into the hall, found her sitting by the hearth,  her chin on her hand, looking into the fire. He carried a velvet box  in his hand and, setting it down, lifted the lid and let out a little  golden-brown dog.    Anne de Cornault exclaimed with pleasure as the little creature bounded  toward her. \"Oh, it looks like a bird or a butterfly!\" she cried as she  picked it up; and the dog put its paws on her shoulders and looked at  her with eyes \"like a Christian's.\" After that she would never have  it out of her sight, and petted and talked to it as if it had been a  child--as indeed it was the nearest thing to a child she was to know.  Yves de Cornault was much pleased with his purchase. The dog had been  brought to him by a sailor from an East India merchantman, and the  sailor had bought it of a pilgrim in a bazaar at Jaffa, who had stolen  it from a nobleman's wife in China: a perfectly permissible thing to do,  since the pilgrim was a Christian and the nobleman a heathen doomed to  hell-fire.    Yves de Cornault had paid a long price for the dog, for they were  beginning to be in demand at the French court, and the sailor knew he  had got hold of a good thing; but Anne's pleasure was so great that,  to see her laugh and play with the little animal, her husband would  doubtless have given twice the sum.    *****    So far, all the evidence is at one, and the narrative plain sailing;  but now the steering becomes difficult. I will try to keep as nearly as  possible to Anne's own statements; though toward the end, poor thing....    Well, to go back. The very year after the little brown dog was brought  to Kerfol, Yves de Cornault, one winter night, was found dead at the  head of a narrow flight of stairs leading down from his wife's rooms to  a door opening on the court. It was his wife who found him and gave the  alarm, so distracted, poor wretch, with fear and horror--for his blood  was all over her--that at first the roused household could not make out  what she was saying, and thought she had suddenly gone mad. But there,  sure enough, at the top of the stairs lay her husband, stone dead, and  head foremost, the blood from his wounds dripping down to the steps  below him. He had been dreadfully scratched and gashed about the face  and throat, as if with curious pointed weapons; and one of his legs  had a deep tear in it which had cut an artery, and probably caused his  death. But how did he come there, and who had murdered him?    His wife declared that she had been asleep in her bed, and hearing  his cry had rushed out to find him lying on the stairs; but this was  immediately questioned. In the first place, it was proved that from her  room she could not have heard the struggle on the stairs, owing to the  thickness of the walls and the length of the intervening passage; then  it was evident that she had not been in bed and asleep, since she was  dressed when she roused the house, and her bed had not been slept in.  Moreover, the door at the bottom of the stairs was ajar, and it was  noticed by the chaplain (an observant man) that the dress she wore was  stained with blood about the knees, and that there were traces of small  blood-stained hands low down on the staircase walls, so that it was  conjectured that she had really been at the postern-door when her  husband fell and, feeling her way up to him in the darkness on her hands  and knees, had been stained by his blood dripping down on her. Of course  it was argued on the other side that the blood-marks on her dress might  have been caused by her kneeling down by her husband when she rushed out  of her room; but there was the open door below, and the fact that the  finger-marks in the staircase all pointed upward.    The accused held to her statement for the first two days, in spite of  its improbability; but on the third day word was brought to her that  Herve de Lanrivain, a young nobleman of the neighbourhood, had been  arrested for complicity in the crime. Two or three witnesses thereupon  came forward to say that it was known throughout the country that  Lanrivain had formerly been on good terms with the lady of Cornault; but  that he had been absent from Brittany for over a year, and people had  ceased to associate their names. The witnesses who made this statement  were not of a very reputable sort. One was an old herb-gatherer  suspected of witchcraft, another a drunken clerk from a neighbouring  parish, the third a half-witted shepherd who could be made to say  anything; and it was clear that the prosecution was not satisfied  with its case, and would have liked to find more definite proof of  Lanrivain's complicity than the statement of the herb-gatherer, who  swore to having seen him climbing the wall of the park on the night of  the murder. One way of patching out incomplete proofs in those days was  to put some sort of pressure, moral or physical, on the accused person.  It is not clear what pressure was put on Anne de Cornault; but on  the third day, when she was brought in court, she \"appeared weak and  wandering,\" and after being encouraged to collect herself and speak  the truth, on her honour and the wounds of her Blessed Redeemer, she  confessed that she had in fact gone down the stairs to speak with Herve  de Lanrivain (who denied everything), and had been surprised there by  the sound of her husband's fall. That was better; and the prosecution  rubbed its hands with satisfaction. The satisfaction increased when  various dependents living at Kerfol were induced to say--with apparent  sincerity--that during the year or two preceding his death their master  had once more grown uncertain and irascible, and subject to the fits  of brooding silence which his household had learned to dread before his  second marriage. This seemed to show that things had not been going well  at Kerfol; though no one could be found to say that there had been any  signs of open disagreement between husband and wife.    Anne de Cornault, when questioned as to her reason for going down at  night to open the door to Herve de Lanrivain, made an answer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24384"],[0,"365 Luncheon Dishes: A Luncheon Dish for Every Day in the Year (#3)"],[1,"from the stove and add 2 tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine.      16.--Chicken Fritters.
