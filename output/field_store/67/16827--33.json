Similarly, the condition of  the animal is shown to a certain extent by the appearance of the mucous  membranes. For example, when the horse is anemic as a result of disease  or of inappropriate feed the mucous membranes become pale. This change  in the mucous membranes can be seen most readily in the lining of the  eyelids and in the lining of the nostril. For convenience of examination  the eyelids can readily be everted. Paleness means weak circulation or  poor blood. Increased redness occurs physiologically in painful  conditions, excitement, and following severe exertion. Under such  conditions the increase of circulation is transitory. In fevers there is  an increased redness in the mucous membrane, and this continues so long  as the fever lasts. In some diseases red spots or streaks form in the  mucous membrane. This usually indicates an infectious disease of  considerable severity, and occurs in blood poisoning, purpura  hemorrhagica, hemorrhagic septicemia, and in urticaria. When the liver  is deranged and does not operate, or when the red-blood corpuscles are  broken down, as in serious cases of influenza, there is a yellowish  discoloration of the mucous membrane. The mucous membranes become bluish  or blue when the blood is imperfectly oxidized and contains an excess of  carbon dioxid. This condition exists in any serious disease of the  respiratory tract, as pneumonia, and in heart failure.    The temperature of the skin varies with the temperature of the body. If  there is fever the temperature of the skin is likely to be increased.  Sometimes, however, as a result of poor circulation and irregular  distribution of the blood, the body may be warmer than normal, while the  extremities (the legs and ears) may be cold. Where the general surface  of the body becomes cold it is evident that the small blood vessels in  the skin have contracted and are keeping the blood away, as during a  chill, or that the heart is weak and is unable to pump the blood to the  surface, and that the animal is on the verge of collapse.    The skin is moist, to a certain degree, at all times in a healthy horse.  This moisture is not in the form of a perceptible sweat, but it is  enough to keep the skin pliable and to cause the hair to have a soft,  healthy feel. In some chronic diseased conditions and in fever, the skin  becomes dry. In this case the hair has a harsh feel that is quite  different from the condition observed in health, and from the fact of  its being so dry the individual hairs do not adhere to one another, they  stand apart, and the animal has what is known as \"a staring coat.\" When,  during a fever, sweating occurs, it is usually an indication that the  crisis is passed. Sometimes sweating is an indication of pain. A horse  with tetanus or azoturia sweats profusely. Horses sweat freely when  there is a serious impediment to respiration; they sweat under  excitement, and, of course, from the well-known physiological causes of  heat and work. Local sweating, or sweating of a restricted area of the  body, denotes some kind of nerve interference.    Swellings of the skin usually come from wounds or other external causes  and have no special connection with the diagnosis of internal diseases.  There are, however, a number of conditions in which the swelling of the  skin is a symptom of a derangement of some other part of the body. For  example, there is the well-known \"stocking,\" or swelling of the legs  about the fetlock joints, in influenza. There is the soft swelling of  the hind legs that occurs so often in draft horses when standing still  and that comes from previous inflammation (lymphangitis) or from  insufficient heart power. Dropsy, or edema of the skin, may occur  beneath the chest or abdomen from heart insufficiency or from chronic  collection of fluid in the chest or abdomen (hydrothorax, ascites, or  anemia). In anasarca or purpura hemorrhagica large soft swellings appear  on any part of the skin, but usually on the legs, side of the body, and  about the head.    Gas collects under the skin in some instances. This comes from a local  inoculation with an organism which produces a fermentation beneath the  skin and causes the liberation of gas which inflates the skin, or the  gas may be air that enters through a wound penetrating some  air-containing organ, as the lungs. The condition here described is  known as emphysema. Emphysema may follow the fracture of a rib when the  end of a bone is forced inward and caused to penetrate the lung, or it  may occur when, as a result of an ulcerating process, an organ  containing air is perforated. This accident is more common in cattle  than it is in horses. Emphysema is recognized by the fact that the  swelling that it causes is not hot or sensitive on pressure. It emits a  peculiar crackling sound when it is stroked or pressed upon.    Wounds of the skin may be of importance in the diagnosis of internal  disease. Wounds over the bony prominence, as the point of the hip, the  point of the shoulder, and the greatest convexity of the ribs, occur  when a horse is unable to stand for a long time and, through continually  lying upon his side, has shut off the circulation to the portion of the  skin that covers parts of the body that carry the greatest weight, and  in this way has caused them to mortify. Little, round, soft, doughlike  swellings occur on the skin and may be scattered freely over the surface  of the body when the horse is afflicted with urticaria. Similar  eruptions, but distributed less generally, about the size of a silver  dollar, may occur as a symptom of dourine, or colt distemper. Hard  lumps, from which radiate welt-like swellings of the lymphatics, occur  in glanders, and blisterlike eruptions occur around the mouth and  pasterns in horsepox.      THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION.    The first item in this portion of the examination consists in taking the  pulse. The pulse may be counted and its character may be determined at  any point where a large artery occupies a situation close to the skin  and above a hard tissue, such as a bone, cartilage, or tendon. The most  convenient place for taking the pulse of the horse is at the jaw. The  external maxillary artery runs from between the jaws, around the lower  border of the jawbone, and up on the outside of the jawbone to the face.  It is located immediately in front of the heavy muscles of the cheek.  Its throb can be felt most distinctly just before it turns around the  lower border of the jawbone. The balls of the first and second or of the  second and third fingers should be pressed lightly on the skin over this  artery when its pulsations are to be studied.    The normal pulse of the healthy horse varies in frequency as follows:        Stallion                     28 to 32 beats per minute.        Gelding                      33 to 38 beats per minute.        Mare                         34 to 40 beats per minute.        Foal 2 to 3 years old        40 to 50 beats per minute.        Foal 6 to 12 months old      45 to 60 beats per minute.        Foal 2 to 4 weeks old        70 to 90 beats per minute.    The pulse is accelerated by the digestion of rich food, by hot weather,  exercise, excitement, and alarm. It is slightly more rapid in the  evening than it is in the morning. Well-bred horses have a slightly more  rapid pulse than sluggish, cold-blooded horses. The pulse should be  regular; that is, the separate beats should follow each other after  intervals of equal length, and the beats should be of equal fullness, or  volume.    In disease, the pulse may become slower or more rapid than in health.  Slowing of the pulse may be caused by old age, great exhaustion, or  excessive cold. It may be due to depression of the central nervous  system, as in dumminess, or be the result of the administration of  drugs, such as digitalis or strophantus. A rapid pulse is almost always  found in fever, and the more severe the infection and the weaker the  heart the more rapid is the pulse. Under these conditions, the beats may  rise to 80, 90, or even 120 per minute. When the pulse is above 100 per  minute the outlook for recovery is not promising, and especially if this  symptom accompanies high temperature or occurs late in an infectious  disease. In nearly all of the diseases of the heart and in anemia the  pulse becomes rapid.    The pulse is irregular in diseases of the heart, and especially where  the valves are affected. The irregularity may consist in varying  intervals between the beats or the dropping of one or more beats at  regular or irregular intervals. The latter condition sometimes occurs in  chronic diseases of the brain. The pulse is said to be weak, or soft,  when the beats are indistinct, because little blood is forced through  the artery by each contraction of the heart. This condition occurs when  there is a constriction of the vessels leading from the heart and it  occurs in certain infectious and febrile diseases, and is an indication  of heart weakness.    In examining the heart itself it is necessary to recall that it lies in  the anterior portion of the chest slightly to the left of the median  line and that it extends from the third to the sixth rib. It extends  almost to the breastbone, and a little more than half of the distance  between the breastbone and the backbone. In contracting, it rotates  slightly on its axis, so that the point of the heart, which lies below,  is pressed against the left chest wall at a place immediately above the  point of the elbow. The heart has in it four chambers--two in the left  and two in the right side. The upper chamber of the left side (left  auricle) receives the blood as it comes from the lungs, passes it to the  lower chamber of the left side (left ventricle), and from here it is  sent with great force (for this chamber has very strong, thick walls)  through the aorta and its branches (the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2343"],[0,"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge (#3)"],[1," concerned in the murder and had fled  from justice.\"    \"That is certainly a possible point of view.  On the face of it you  must admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants  should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked  him on the one night when he had a guest.  They had him alone at their  mercy every other night in the week.\"    \"Then why did they fly?\"    \"Quite so.  Why did they fly?  There is a big fact.  Another big fact  is the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear  Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an  explanation which would cover both of these big facts?  If it were one  which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious  phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary  hypothesis.  If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit  themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a  solution.\"    \"But what is our hypothesis?\"    Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.    \"You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible.  There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of  Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.\"    \"But what possible connection?\"    \"Let us take it link by link.  There is, on the face of it, something  unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young  Spaniard and Scott Eccles.  It was the former who forced the pace.  He  called upon Eccles at the other end of London on the very day after he  first met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him  down to Esher.  Now, what did he want with Eccles?  What could Eccles  supply?  I see no charm in the man.  He is not particularly  intelligent--not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin.  Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met  as particularly suited to his purpose?  Has he any one outstanding  quality?  I say that he has.  He is the very type of conventional  British respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress  another Briton.  You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed  of questioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.\"    \"But what was he to witness?\"    \"Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another  way.  That is how I read the matter.\"    \"I see, he might have proved an alibi.\"    \"Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi.  We will  suppose, for argument's sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are  confederates in some design.  The attempt, whatever it may be, is to  come off, we will say, before one o'clock.  By some juggling of the  clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed  earlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia  went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more  than twelve.  If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by  the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation.  Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of  law that the accused was in the house all the time.  It was an  insurance against the worst.\"    \"Yes, yes, I see that.  But how about the disappearance of the others?\"    \"I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any  insuperable difficulties.  Still, it is an error to argue in front of  your data.  You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit  your theories.\"    \"And the message?\"    \"How did it run?  'Our own colours, green and white.'  Sounds like  racing.  'Green open, white shut.'  That is clearly a signal.  'Main  stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.'  This is an  assignation.  We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all.  It was clearly a dangerous quest.  She would not have said 'Godspeed'  had it not been so.  'D'--that should be a guide.\"    \"The man was a Spaniard.  I suggest that 'D' stands for Dolores, a  common female name in Spain.\"    \"Good, Watson, very good--but quite inadmissable.  A Spaniard would  write to a Spaniard in Spanish.  The writer of this note is certainly  English.  Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this  excellent inspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky  fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable  fatigues of idleness.\"            *           *           *    An answer had arrived to Holmes's telegram before our Surrey officer  had returned.  Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook  when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with  a laugh.    \"We are moving in exalted circles,\" said he.    The telegram was a list of names and addresses:    Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr.  Hynes Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old  Hall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.    \"This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,\" said  Holmes.  \"No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already  adopted some similar plan.\"    \"I don't quite understand.\"    \"Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that  the message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an  assignation.  Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in  order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the  seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a  very large one.  It is equally certain that this house cannot be more  than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that  direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back  in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would  only be valid up to one o'clock.  As the number of large houses close  to Oxshott must be limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to  the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them.  Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein  must lie among them.\"            *           *           *    It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty  Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.    Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable  quarters at the Bull.  Finally we set out in the company of the  detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge.  It was a cold, dark March  evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a  fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the  tragic goal to which it led us.          2.  The Tiger of San Pedro      A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high  wooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved  and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a  slate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door  there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.    \"There's a constable in possession,\" said Baynes.  \"I'll knock at the  window.\"  He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on  the pane.  Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a  chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room.  An  instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the  door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.    \"What's the matter, Walters?\" asked Baynes sharply.    The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh  of relief.    \"I am glad you have come, sir.  It has been a long evening, and I don't  think my nerve is as good as it was.\"    \"Your nerve, Walters?  I should not have thought you had a nerve in  your body.\"    \"Well, sir, it's this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the  kitchen.  Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come  again.\"    \"That what had come again?\"    \"The devil, sir, for all I know.  It was at the window.\"    \"What was at the window, and when?\"    \"It was just about two hours ago.  The light was just fading.  I was  sitting reading in the chair.  I don't know what made me look up, but  there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir,  what a face it was!  I'll see it in my dreams.\"    \"Tut, tut, Walters.  This is not talk for a police-constable.\"    \"I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and there's no use to deny  it.  It wasn't black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know  but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it.  Then  there was the size of it--it was twice yours, sir.  And the look of  it--the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a  hungry beast.  I tell you, sir, I couldn't move a finger, nor get my  breath, till it whisked away and was gone.  Out I ran and through the  shrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.\"    \"If I didn't know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black  mark against you for this.  If it were the devil himself a constable on  duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him.  I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?\"    \"That, at least, is very easily settled,\" said Holmes, lighting his  little pocket lantern.  \"Yes,\" he reported, after a short examination  of the grass bed, \"a number twelve shoe, I should say.  If he was all  on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.\"    \"What became of him?\"    \"He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.\"    \"Well,\" said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, \"whoever  he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he's gone for the  present, and we have more immediate things to attend to.  Now, Mr.  Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.\"    The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded"]]]
