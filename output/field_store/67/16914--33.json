A Garden Party in the Temple          On hospitable thoughts intent      To me the Inner Temple sent            An invitation,      A garden party 'twas to be,      And I accepted readily            And with elation;      Good reason too, but oft the seeds      Of reason flower in senseless deeds.        I stood as savage as a bear,      For not a human being there            Knew I from Adam      I heard around in various tones,      \"_So_ glad to see you, Mr. Jones;\"            \"Good morning, Madam.\"      It seemed so painfully absurd      To stand and never speak a word.        I brought my doom upon myself,      And there I was upon the shelf            In melancholy.      Why, say you, did I go at all?      I once met Chloris at a ball,            And in my folly      I went and suffered all this pain      In hopes to see her once again.        Of strawberries a pound at least      I ate, and made myself a beast            With tea and sherry;      And raspberries I ate and trembled,      Until I felt that I resembled            Myself a berry,      But 'twas the berry that at school      We used to call a gooseberry fool.        The I. C. R. V.[F] band droned on,      While guests had come and guests had gone            Since my arrival;      My brow grew gloomier with despair,      And on it sat the guilty air            Of a survival      Of some remorse for ancient crimes      Wrought in the pre-historic times.        My seventh cup of tea was done,      My seventh glass of wine begun,            Then of her coming      I was aware, nor shall forget      How she and that brown sherry set            My brains a-humming;      Well should I be rewarded soon      For all the weary afternoon.        Her eyes looked vaguely into mine      Without as much as half a sign            Of recognition.      My heart, my heart! the blow was sore,      But you have often been before            In this condition;      As said the bard of old, those eyes      Are not my only Paradise.[G]    [F] Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers.    [G] Dante, Par. xviii. 21.          The Spinning-House of the Future        \"Cada puta hile.\"--_Don Quixote_, i. 46.          Without my dinner here I lie,            And all because that proctor      With her stout bull-dogs passed, and I                        Mocked her.        For Clara is at Girton too,            That dragon is her tutor,      I threatened once what I would do,                        Shoot her.        Her life by Clara's tears was saved,            Wherefore she doth detest me,      And hither hungry and unshaved                        Pressed me.        I would that I could have commenced            An action 'gainst that devil,      Like that once brought by Kemp against                        Neville.[H]        To her I owe the statute framed            That one against it sinning      Should dwell within the house that's named                        Spinning.        Ah me! it runs in sections three:            Who speaks to Girton student      Is fined to teach him how to be                        Prudent.        Who loves a Girton girl must do            Twelve months on bread and water,      From a digestive point of view                        Slaughter.        Who kisses her commits a crime            By hanging expiated,      And she in tears must spend her time                        Gated.        Would that at Oxford I had been,            At Balliol or at Merton,      And then I never should have seen                        Girton.        Go down I must, no more shall I            And Clara cross the same bridge;      Still, Granta, art thou her and my                        Cambridge.        Some day on this her eyes may light,            This doggerel stiff and jointless,      And she may own it is not quite                        Pointless.    [H] An action brought in 1861 by a dressmaker at Cambridge against the  Vice-Chancellor for false imprisonment in the Spinning-House (the  University prison). The Court of Common Pleas held _inter alia_ that no  action lies against a judge for a judicial decision on a matter within  his jurisdiction (10 Common Bench Reports, New Series, 523).          How we found our Verdict          We sat in the jury-box, twelve were we all,      And the clock was just pointing to ten in the hall,      His Lordship he bowed to the jury, and we      Bowed back to his Lordship as gravely as he.        The case of _De Weller_ v. _Jones_ was the first,      And we all settled down and prepared for the worst      When old Smithers, Q.C., began slowly to preach      Of a promise of marriage and action for breach.        A barmaid the plaintiff was, wondrous the skill      Wherewith she was wont her tall tankards to fill,      The defendant, a publican, sought for his bride      Such a paragon, urged by professional pride.        But the course of true love ran no smoother for her      Than the Pas de Calais or the bark of a fir,      The defendant discovered a widow with gold      In the bank and the plaintiff was left in the cold.        An hour Smithers spoke, and he said that the heart      Of the plaintiff at Jones's fell touch flew apart,      But a cheque for a thousand might help to repair      The destruction effected by love and despair.        Miss de Weller was called, and in ladylike tones      She described all the injury suffered from Jones,      How he called her at first \"Angelina,\" and this      Soon cooled to \"Miss Weller,\" and lastly to \"Miss.\"        But the jury were shaken a little when Gore      Cross-examined about her engagements before,      For Jones was the sixth of the strings to her bow      And with five other verdicts she solaced her woe.        Re-examined by Smithers, she won us again,      For the tears of a maid are a terror to men,      Then his Lordship awoke from his nap and explained      How love that is frequent is love that is feigned.        Miss de Weller looked daggers, and under the paint      Of her cheeks she grew pale and fell down in a faint,      She played her trump-card in the late afternoon,      For damages satisfy girls who can swoon.        Till she fainted most thought that a farthing would do,      Though I was in favour of pounds--one or two;      But after the faint--and she _was_ so well dressed--      At a hundred the void in her heart was assessed.          A Greek Libel          ARCHILOCHUS.        Neobule, yesternight      Saw I thee in beauty dight,      On thy head a myrtle spray      Cast its shadow as the day      By the stars was put to flight.      Twining on thy temples white      Roses gave the myrtle light,      Sign thou wilt not say me nay,                    Neobule.

NEOBULE.        Sorry poet, who dost dare      Cast bold glances on my hair,      Let thy most presumptuous eyes      Seek another enterprise,      Ceasing now to linger there.      Hearken, I can tell thee where      Grow the bushes that will spare      Rods to teach thee humbler guise,                    Sorry poet.      Know I not that I am fair?      Need thy halting verse declare      What my mirror daily cries?      Rid me of thy silly sighs,      Rid me of thy hateful stare,                    Sorry poet.          ARCHILOCHUS.        Neobule, poets see      Dreams of things that are to be.      Vengeance is the poet's trade,      Come, iambus, to my aid      'Gainst the fools who scoff at me.      All the world will laugh with glee      When they mark my verses free      Grasp thee like a pillory,      And thy scorn with scorn repaid,                    Neobule.      E'en in death thou canst not flee      From the doom the Fates decree.      When my satire's keenest blade      Cuts thee to the heart, fond maid,      I shall laugh, but what of thee,                    Neobule?          Le Temps Passe          Those brave old days when King Abuse did reign      We sigh for, but we shall not see again.      Then Eldon sowed the seed of equity      That grew to bounteous harvest, and with glee      A Bar of modest numbers shared the grain.

O'er pauper settlements men fought amain,      And golden guineas followed in their train,      John Doe then flourished like a lusty tree,      And Richard Roe brought many a noble fee,      We mourn in unremunerated pain                            Those brave old days.    [I] See, for instance, the well-known case of _Mostyn_ v. _Fabrigas_, in  which the plaintiff declared that the defendant on the 1st of September,  in the year 1771, made an assault upon the said plaintiff at Minorca, to  wit, at London, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bow, in the Ward of Cheap.

There you read his penetrating analysis of the  figures on the Zionist stage upon whom he had to rely. There you are  made to feel his doubts, his dread of death. In the midst of life he  felt himself encircled by the Shadow of Death. There you found the  explanation of his great haste, why he was so anxious to bring a  measure of practical reality to the Jewish people even if it  necessitated a detour from the land which was becoming more and more a  part of his hopes and desires. The \"Diaries\" are unrestrained and  unstudied. They were written hurriedly in the heat of the moment. They  reveal the making of the great personality who gave only a glimpse of  himself in \"The Jewish State.\" They show the writer evolving as the  hero of a great and lasting legend. The pamphlet is one of the  chapters in the story of his struggle to achieve in eight years what  his people had not been able to achieve in two thousand years. He gave  his life to write it.          _Theodor Herzl_    A BIOGRAPHY  based on the work of    _Alex Bein_      Theodor Herzl was born on Wednesday, May 2, 1860, in the city of  Budapest.    Almost next door to his father's house was the liberal-reform temple.  To this house of worship the little boy went regularly with his father  on Sabbaths and Holy Days. At home, too, the essentials of the ritual  were observed. One ceremony which Theodor learned in childhood  remained with him; before every important event and decision he sought  the blessing of his parents.    Even stronger than these impressions, however, was the influence of  his mother. Her education had been German through and through; there  was not a day on which she did not slip into German literature,  especially the classics.    The Jewish world, not alien to her, did not find expression through  her; her conscious efforts were all directed toward implanting the  German cultural heritage in her children. Of even deeper significance  was her sympathetic attitude toward the pride which showed early in  her son, and her skill in transferring to him her sense of form, of  bearing, of tactfulness and of simple grace.    At about the age of twelve he read in a German book about the  Messiah-King whom many Jews still awaited and who would come riding,  like the poorest of the poor on an ass. The history of the Exodus and  the legend of the liberation by the King-Messiah ran together in the  boy's mind, inspiring in him the theme of a wonderful story which he  sought in vain to put into literary form.    A little while thereafter Herzl had the following dream: \"The  King-Messiah came, a glorious and majestic old man, took me in his  arms, and swept off with me on the wings of the wind. On one of the  iridescent clouds we encountered the figure of Moses. The features  were those familiar to me out of my childhood in the statue by  Michelangelo. The Messiah called to Moses: It is for this child that I  have prayed. But to me he said: Go, declare to the Jews that I shall  come soon and perform great wonders and great deeds for my people and  for the whole world.\"    It may be to this period (of his _Bar Mitzvah_) of reawakened Jewish  sensitivity, of heightened responsiveness to the expectations of his  elders, of resurgent interest in Jewish historical studies--it may be  to this period that the dream of a dedicated life belonged. It is  almost certain, too, that for the great event of the _Bar Mitzvah_ the  old grandfather of Semlin came to Pest. About this time, again,  Alkalai, that early, all-but-forgotten Zionist, passed through Vienna  and Budapest on his final journey to Palestine. Whether or not each  one of these circumstances had a direct effect on the boy, the whole  complex surrounds his _Bar Mitzvah_ with the suggestion of the mission  of his life, and, certainly, occasion was given for the awakening in  him of the feeling of dedication to a great enterprise.    The attention, energy and time which Herzl devoted to literature, at  fifteen, his absorption in himself, his activity in the school  literary society meant of course so much less given to his school  work. He found no time at all for science; Jewish questions likewise  disappeared from his interests; he was completely absorbed by German  literary culture. This is all the more astonishing when we reflect  that anti-Semitism continued to increase steadily. As a grown man  Herzl could recall that one of his teachers, in defining the word  \"heathen,\" had said, \"such as idolators, Mohammedans and Jews.\"  Whether it was this incident,--as the memory of the grown man always  insisted--which enraged him beyond endurance, or the increasingly bad  school reports, or both circumstances together, the fact remains that  on February 4, 1875 Herzl left the Technical School.    At sixteen to eighteen in High School, he struggled to define the  basic principles of various literary art forms in order that he might  see more clearly what he himself wanted to say. He took an active and  eager part in the work of the \"German Self-Education Society\" created  by the students of his school. The Jewish world, whose inferior  position always wounded his pride, and whose obstinate separatism  seemed to him utterly meaningless, drifted further and further out of  his mind.    At eighteen, after the sudden death of his only sister, the family  moved to Vienna where Herzl entered the University as a law student.  Herzl, who accounted himself a liberal and an Austrian patriot,  plunged eagerly into the activities of a large student Cultural  Association, attended its discussions and directed its literary  evenings. He had occasion, there, to deride certain Jewish fellow  members who, in his view, displayed an excessive eagerness in their  loyalty to various movements.    This was the extent to which, in these days, he occupied himself with  the Jewish question--at least externally. He concerned himself little  or not at all with the official Jewish world which was seeking to  submerge itself in the surrounding world. He seldom visited the  synagogue.    He was an omnivorous reader. His extraordinary knowledge of books was  evident in his conversation, for he liked to adorn his speech with  quotations, which came readily to his memory. Herzl read Eugen  Duehring's book _The Jewish-Problem as a Problem of Race, Morals and  Culture_--the first and most important effort to find a \"scientific,\"  philosophic, biologic and historical basis for the anti-Semitism which  was sweeping through Europe in those days (1881). Duehring saw the  Jewish question as a purely racial question, and for him the Jewish  race was without any worth whatsoever. Those peoples which, out of a  false sentiment of humanity, had permitted the Jews to live among them  with equal and sometimes even with superior rights, had to be  liberated from the harmful intruder, had to be de-Judaized.    The reading of this book had the effect upon him of a blow between the  eyes. The observations set down in his diary burn with indignation:  \"An infamous book.... If Duehring, who unites so much undeniable  intelligence with so much universality of knowledge, can write like  this, what are we to expect from the ignorant masses?\"    This passionate reaction to Duehring's book shows us how deeply he had  been moved, and how fearfully he had been shaken in his belief that  the Jewish question was on the point of disappearing. We shall find  echoes of this experience in the pages of the _Judenstaat_. For the  time being, however, he shrank from the logical consequences of his  reactions. His inner pride began to build itself up.    The more immediate reaction was undoubtedly a sharpened perception and  evaluation of his fellow-members in the Fraternity. Herzl had joined  and been active in a duelling Fraternity. Here, too, anti-Semitism was  breaking through; student after student expressed himself favorably  toward the Jew-baiting speeches of Schoenerer, who was making a  special effort to win over the universities. In the Fraternity debates  Herzl expressed himself sharply against any open or covert  manifestation of such sympathy. But he was already known for the  sharpness of his tongue and the individuality of his views. Thus he  won to himself neither the few co-religionists who belonged to the  Fraternity nor the mass of the Germanic students.    He had learned from newspaper reports that the Wagner Memorial  meeting, in which his Fraternity had taken a part, had been  transformed into an anti-Semitic demonstration. His Fraternity had,  therefore, identified itself with a movement which he, as a believer  in liberty, was bound to condemn, even if he had not been a Jew. \"It  is pretty clear that, handicapped as I am by my Semitism (the word was  not yet known at the time of my entry), I would today refrain from  seeking a membership which would, indeed, probably be refused me; it  must also be clear to every decent person that under these  circumstances I cannot wish to retain my membership.\" Herzl withdrew  from the organization.    On July 30, 1884, Herzl was admitted to the bar in Vienna. His student  days were over. A new era opened for him, with its challenge to prove  whether or not there was something in him to establish and proclaim to  the world.    In August, he entered on his law practice in the service of the state  and was soon transferred to the court of Salzburg. Though he may at  that time have been so far from Judaism that only pride and a decent  respect for the feelings of his parents stood between him and baptism,  he could not help perceiving that as a Jew he would find the higher  levels of the civil service hierarchy closed to him. On August 5,  1885, he withdrew from the service, determined to seek fame and  fortune as a writer.    Brimming with hope, he set out on a journey which was to be the  introduction to his literary life. He visited Belgium and Holland and  in Berlin"]]]
