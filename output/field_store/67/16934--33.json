And he gets disliked, very often, accordingly.    If you don't want to do a thing, _say_ so; don't make your husband the  scapegoat.    Of course the wife who does this kind of thing never dreams that people  will blame her husband: it's just a convenient fiction to her.    But people are apt to think less of her husband because of it.    So you'll be wise to find some other excuse when excuses are  necessary.--_Exchange._          A Necessity in the Pantry      \"How can you get along without a ham in the house?\" asked one housewife  of another; \"to me it is as necessary as anything we ever have in our  pantry.\"    This housewife, in saying the above, echoed the sentiments of many  others. There is no meat more \"necessary\" in the house than good ham.  Not only is the meat there in all its nutriment but it is  preserved--that is, cured and smoked--in such a way that there is given  to it a piquancy which whets the appetite and gives a stimulus to the  gastric juices, thus aiding--so the doctors tell us--the process of  digestion.    In so many cases of convalescence where the appetite is flagging and the  digestion weak, ham and bacon are prescribed, both for their tonic and  nutritive value.    On the crisp snappy mornings of autumn when a hearty breakfast is  necessary and the appetite has not yet recovered from the jading effects  of the hot weather what could be more tempting and more nourishing than  a slice of broiled ham--broiled just enough to be thoroughly cooked and  yet not enough to discolor the delicious appetising pink color of the  meat. Even the aroma thrown out in the process of cooking sends a  tempting appeal to the stomach that is impossible to resist.    Buying a whole ham at a time is the best and most economical way of  buying ham, as experience will prove. It can be boiled or baked whole  and sliced for whatever purpose intended. When baked ham is broiled for  breakfast it requires to be cooked just long enough to get hot all the  way through.    It is many years since the curing of ham was first tried and in those  years much has been accomplished. Today Armour's Star Hams represent  perfection in cured ham. In them the highest quality is allied to  skillful curing and careful smoking.    From many thousand hams those intended for the Star brand are chosen;  the process of curing is a specialty of Armour and Company, and careful  smoking over green hickory logs gives the final necessary touch.    They say \"the proof of the pudding is the tasting of it\" and this  applies to Armour's Star Hams as well.    [Many ways of using this, to most people, necessary meat, will be found  on page 12.]    [Illustration: _Built in Cupboards and Shelves Economize on Space and  are Especially Nice for Linens_]          Halloween Hints      Witch Apples    Bake large apples from which the core has been removed until soft, but  not long enough to burst the skin. When cooked, insert a marshmallow  into the core space, put a teaspoonful of sugar on top and a few  maraschino cherries. When ready to serve turn over each a scant  teaspoonful of brandy and light just as the table is reached. The brandy  will burn with a ghastly flame and melt the sugar and marshmallows.  Whipped cream served in a bowl is a delicious addition.      Witch Cake    Cream one half cupful of butter with one and one half cupfuls of sugar;  add three eggs and beat five minutes; add one cupful of milk. Sift  together one third cupful of cornstarch, and two cupfuls of flour, one  and one half teaspoonfuls of ground mixed spices, and three teaspoonfuls  of baking powder; then add to the mixture. Now add one cupful of seeded  floured raisins, also one cupful of chopped nuts. Turn into a well  greased loaf cake pan and bake in a moderate oven about forty-five  minutes. Frost with a white boiled icing. Melt sweet chocolate to equal  one third cupful, flavor with a teaspoonful of lemon juice, add one  cupful of boiled chestnuts which have been run through the meat grinder,  and enough confectionery sugar to make a paste easily handled. Roll and  cut (by pasteboard pattern) black cats or any other Halloween figure,  press them into the icing on the sides of the cake.          Sauteing and Frying    [Illustration]      \"What is the difference between sauteing potatoes and frying them?\" asks  a young housekeeper from South Dakota in the Day's Work, and as the  subject is of much importance and deserving of more space than may be  given to it in the correspondence columns it is answered here.    In a word, to saute--pronounced sotay--anything, is to cook it in a  shallow frying pan with a little fat, turning as one side is browned to  let the other color. Cooked potatoes are often warmed over this way. To  \"fry\" potatoes, croquettes, etc., is to cook them in deep boiling fat,  immersing the object to be fried while the fat is boiling hot.    That is the difference between sauteing and frying but there are one or  two points about frying--this much abused way of cooking--that must be  borne in mind if one would have the best results. In frying, a deep  kettle must be used and it is wise to keep one for this purpose only.  The one called a Scotch bowl is especially made for this purpose and is  most satisfactory.    Use only the best fat for frying--an absolutely pure leaf lard which  contains neither water nor salt and have your kettle two thirds full,  that is, deep enough to quite cover the article to be fried. Once  started, this quantity must be kept up, as it reduces slightly with each  frying, but the same fat may be used again and again if care be taken to  keep it clean and of a good color. After each frying let the fat cool a  little and strain to remove crumbs, etc., which would otherwise burn and  spoil the fat. If strained when very hot it is apt to unsolder the  strainer. Wipe the kettle clean, return the strained lard and set aside  until wanted again.    French Fried Potatoes are sliced thin or cut lengthwise in strips laid  in ice water for half an hour; then dried thoroughly between two towels  and plunged into boiling deep fat. As soon as they are delicately  browned they are fished out with a split spoon and laid in a hot  colander to drain off every drop of fat. Serve at once.    German Fried Potatoes are as a rule cooked and cold before they are  sauteed. Some prefer them to the French. To many minds they never get  quite rid of the stale taste that clings to the cold potato. The same  may be said of stewed cold, cooked potatoes. The least objectionable way  of serving them as left-overs is to saute them.    [Illustration: Simple Furniture of Quaint Shape and Design]    \"_To have bread excite thankfulness, and a drink of water send the heart  to God, is better than sighs for the unattainable. To plough a straight  furrow on Monday, or dust a room well on Tuesday, or kiss a bumped  forehead on Wednesday, is worth more than the most ecstatic thrill under  Sunday eloquence. Spirituality is seeing God in common things and  showing God in common tasks._\"--MALTBIE D. BACOCK.          The School Child's Sleep      The mother who has a child at school may not be able to help him with  his lessons, but there is one thing she can do for him which will  benefit him even more, and that is to see that he gets enough sleep.    Insufficient sleep affects the nerves, the temper, the digestion, the  mental quickness, and even the morals of children. The child who gets  enough sleep is the one who is bright and quick mentally, who grows  normally and well, who eats properly and who is not peevish and  irritable.    An early supper and an early bedtime are the things for the school  child. Then put him in a well-ventilated bedroom and let him have ten or  eleven full hours of slumber and he'll wake up bright and healthy and  good, too.    Many of the little whining nervous children we see are simply suffering  from lack of sleep. Many small naughtinesses simply come from tired  nerves and weariness of mind and body. So many mothers notice such a  difference in the behavior of children once they have started to school  and are at a loss to understand the reason. It is because the daily nap  which the child took before he went to school has been given up, but the  bedtime hour has not been changed. Consequently the nerves of the child  suffer.    Try giving the school child supper at half past five, a nourishing and  easily digested supper, too. Then at eight, promptly pack him off to  bed. If he doesn't sleep let him sip a cup of hot milk, and sit beside  him until he drowses off. Sleep is largely a habit and will be easily  acquired in a few evenings. And oh, the difference it will make to the  child in every way.--_Exchange._           *       *       *       *       *    Hints on Picture Hanging    Hang the pictures from the ceiling or picture rail by means of a thin  cord as nearly as possible the color of the walls. When this is done you  may, if you like, fill up the spaces left above the smaller pictures by  placing therein a miniature, or an old blue plate, or a little plaster  relief. This arrangement gives all the space, above or below, upon which  to rest your eyes, and is infinitely preferable to the usual way of  hanging pictures one over the other or all up and down the walls.  Fishing line makes an excellent substitute for picture wire and is much  less conspicuous.          From the Pantry Shelf         Keeping the pantry shelf supplied with foods that are easily       prepared and served is one of the things which mark the       careful housewife. The Veribest list of prepared foods       embraces soups, meats, baked beans and many varieties of       potted ham, veal, chicken, etc., all of which are perfect.       Their use means a saving of time, fuel and energy--with       satisfaction for the whole family.      CHICKEN MOUSSE    One cup of chicken stock (ma"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26014"],[0,"Practical Taxidermy (#3)"],[1,"(in a similar manner to our ordinary spirits of wine),  which, if followed by a caustic alkali (such as natron may have been),  to dissolve the solid albumen, fibrin and gelatine, ought certainly to  have exercised a decidedly tanning influence.    Following this is oil of cedar. The present oil of cedar (ol cedrat of  commerce) cannot be intended, as that is made from the citron, and  being merely an essential oil can have little of the antiseptic or  corrosive qualities imputed to the ancient oil of cedars. May it not  have been a product distilled from the actual cedar tree (one of the  coniferae) similar to our oil or spirit of turpentine? I have,  however, been unable to discover any writings in certain support of  this theory; \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" merely mentions it as \"a  certain oily liquor extracted from the cedar;\" while Boitard boldly  says, \"... Sans doute l'essence de terebenthine.\" [Footnote: The  Detroit Review of Medicine and Pharmacy for July, 1876. gives a report  of a case of poisoning through an overdose of oil of red cedar (oleum  juniper virginianae) which supports my theory as to there being  extracted an oil from the Lebanon (or other) cedars partaking of the  nature of turpentine and totally distinct from ol cedrat.]    Whatever may have been the composition of--and manner of applying--the  foregoing agents, it is certain that they had the effect intended, for  Diodorus writes fully within bounds when mentioning the life-like  appearance of the features in mummies, as we know by later  discoveries, for there are some well-known specimens still in  existence of which the eyelids, lashes, eyebrows, and hair are still  in their natural state, and this after an interval of thousands of  years. In some mummies, for instance, the contour of the features is  plainly discernible, and surely this is scientific \"preparation of  specimens\" not to be excelled in the present day.    The Egyptian mode of embalming was imitated occasionally by the Jews,  Greeks, Romans, and other nations, and has sometimes been adopted in  modern times, but never to the same extent or perfection as they  attained. The only other method which is known to have been adopted as  a national custom was that practised by the Guanches, the ancient  inhabitants of the Canary Isles. Their mummies are particularly  described by M. Bortj de St. Vincent, in his 'Essai sur les Isles  Fortunees.' Numerous and vast catacombs are filled with them in each  of the thirteen islands, but the best known is one in Teneriffe, which  contained upwards of a thousand bodies. The mummies are sewn up in  goat or sheep skins, and five or six are commonly found together, the  skin over the head of one being stitched to that over the feet of  another; but those of the great are contained in cases hollowed out of  a piece of savin wood. The bodies are not bandaged, and are dry, light  tan-coloured, and slightly aromatic. Several of them are completely  preserved with distinct, though distorted, features.    The method of embalming adopted by the Guanches consisted in removing  the viscera in either of the same ways as the Egyptians practised,  then filling the cavities with aromatic powders, frequently washing  and anointing the surface, and, lastly, drying the body very carefully  for fifteen or sixteen days in the sun or by a stove.    [Footnote: My friend, the late Thos. Baker, wrote me, some time before  his sad death by shipwreck: \"In an old work which I have, 'A General  Collection of Voyages,' I find the following relating to the  'Guanches' in vol. i, book ii, chap. i, page 184, 'The Voyage of Juan  Rejon to the Canary Islands, AD. 1491': 'When any person died, they  preserved the body in this manner: First, they carried it to a cave  and stretched it on a fiat stone, where they opened it and took out  the bowels; then, twice a day, they washed the porous parts of the  body, viz, the arm-pits, behind the ears, the groin, between the  fingers, and the neck, with cold water. After washing it sufficiently  they anointed those parts with sheep's butter (?), and sprinkled them  with a powder made of the dust of decayed pine trees, and a sort of  brushwood which the Spaniards call Brefsos, together with the powder  of pumice stone. Then they let the body remain till it was perfectly  dry, when the relatives of the deceased came and swaddled it in sheep  or goat skins dressed. Girding all tight with long leather thongs,  they put it in the cave which had been set apart by the deceased for  his burying place, without any covering. There were particular persons  set apart for this office of embalming, each sex performing it for  those of their own. During the process they watched the bodies very  carefully to prevent the ravens from devouring them, the relations of  the deceased bringing them victuals and waiting on them during the  time of their watching.'\"]    So complete is the desiccation of these mummies, that a whole body,  which Blumenbach possessed, weighed only 7.5 lb, though the dried  skeleton of a body of the same size, as usually prepared, weighs at  least 9 lb.    In some situations the conditions of the soil and atmosphere, by the  rapidity with which they permit the drying of the animal tissues to be  effected, are alone sufficient for the preservation of the body in the  form of a mummy; this is the case in some parts of Peru, especially at  Arica, where considerable numbers of bodies have been found quite dry  in pits dug in a saline dry soil. There is an excellent specimen of a  mummy of this kind in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, which was  brought from Caxamarca by General Paroissien--like most of them, it is  in a sitting posture, with the knees almost touching the chin, and the  hands by the sides of the face. It is quite dry and hard; the features  are distorted, but nearly perfect, and the hair has fallen off. The  Peruvian mummies do not appear to have been subjected to any  particular preparation, the dry and absorbent earth in which they are  placed being sufficient to prevent them from putrefying. M. Humboldt  found the bodies of many Spaniards and Peruvians lying on former  fields of battle dried and preserved in the open air. In the deserts  of Africa the preservation of the body is secured by burying it in the  hot sand; and even in Europe soils are sometimes met with in which the  bodies undergo a slow process of drying, and then remain almost  unalterable even on exposure to the air and moisture. There is a vault  at Toulouse in which a vast number of bodies that have been buried  were found, after many years, dry and without a trace of the effects  of putrefaction; and in the vaults of St. Michael's Church, Dublin,  the bodies are similarly preserved. In both cases putrefaction is  prevented by the constant absorption of the moisture from the  atmosphere, and through its medium from the body by the calcareous  soil in which the vaults are dug.--Penny Cyclopaedia, vol. xv, p.  477.\"    Having now given a brief sketch of the best-known methods of  preserving Nature's greatest handiwork--Man--I may mention that the  Egyptians also devoted their energies to the preservation of those  things more intimately connected with our theme, namely, mammals,  birds, etc. A people who knew how to preserve and arrest from decay the  carcase of so immense an animal as the hippopotamus (a mummy of which  was discovered at Thebes), or the various bulls, cows, dogs, cats,  mice, ichneumons, hawks, ibises, fishes, serpents, crocodiles, and  other sacred animals (mummies of which have been and are constantly  found), must have had some glimmerings of taxidermy; many of the  subjects are preserved in so beautiful a manner that mummied ibises,  hawks, etc, are occasionally discovered even in a good state of  preservation, and Cuvier actually found in the intestines of a mummied  ibis (Ibis religiosa, a species still found, though rarely, in Egypt)  the partly-digested skin and scales of a snake!    From this period of the world's history I can discover but few links  to the chain of Practical Taxidermy.    True it is that the Greeks, Romans, and the tribes which inhabited  ancient Britain must have had some knowledge of preserving Skins of  animals slaughtered by them in the chase, for we everywhere read of  the skins of lions, tigers, wolves, etc, being used for purposes of  necessity, as in the case of those barbarians who clothed themselves  with skins as a protection from the inclemency of the weather, and  also in the case of the luxurious Greeks and Romans, who used skins in  the adornment of their persons or homes. In fact, the conversion of  skins into leather must be of the highest antiquity, for, in the Leeds  mummy described in 1828, there was found on the bandages of the head  and face a thong composed of three straps of leather, and many of the  Egyptian divinities are represented with a lion or leopard skin as a  covering for the throne, etc.; and do we not read in many places in  Holy Writ of leather and of tanners?--a notable instance, to wit, in  Simon, the tanner--in fact, the ancient history of all nations teems  with the records of leather and of furs; but of the actual setting up  of animals as specimens I can find no trace.    I doubt, however, if we can carry taxidermy proper farther back than  to about 150 years ago, at which date naturalists appear to have had  some idea of the proper preservation and mounting of natural history  specimens; but Reaumur, more than a century and a quarter ago,  published a treatise on the preservation of skins of birds; however,  as his plan was simply setting up with wires birds which had  previously been steeped in spirits of wine, his method did not find  much favour. It appears that, just after that time, the system was  tried of skinning birds in their fresh state, and also of cutting the  skins longitudinally in two halves, and filling the one half with"]]]
