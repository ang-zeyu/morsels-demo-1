UNACCENTED VOWELS AND UMLAUT.    Sec. 6.    The two most characteristic differences between OHG. and MHG. are: (1)  the spread of umlaut (Sec. 10); (2) the weakening and partial loss of vowels  in unaccented syllables.      1. THE WEAKENING OF UNACCENTED VOWELS.    Sec. 7.    The short vowels a, i, o, u, and the long vowels [e], [i], [o], [u] were  weakened to {e}. This {e} was pronounced like the final {-e} in NHG.  {leute}, see Sec. 3. Examples are:--    {g[e:]ba}, _gift_, {h[e:]rza}, _heart_, {zunga}, _tongue_, {taga}, _days_ =  MHG. {g[e:]be}, {h[e:]rze}, {zunge}, {tage}; {heilag}, _holy_, neut.  {blinda[z]}, _blind_, {n[e:]man}, _to take_ = MHG. {heilec}, {blinde[z]},  {n[e:]men}.    {kunni}, _race, generation_, {gesti}, _guests_ = MHG. {k[u:]nne}, {geste};  {kuning}, _king_, {be[zz]isto}, _best_, dat. pl. {gestim}, _to guests_,  gen. pl. {lembiro}, _of lambs_, {nimit}, _he takes_ = MHG. {k[u:]nec},  {be[zz]est} ({beste}), {gesten}, {lember(e)}, {nimet}.    {haso}, _hare_, nom. acc. pl. fem. {blinto}, _blind_, gen. pl. {tago},  _of days_ = MHG. {hase}, {blinde}, {tage}; acc. sing. {hason}, _hare_ =  MHG. {hasen}.    {fridu}, _peace_, dat. sing. {g[e:]bu}, _to a gift_, {nimu}, _I take_ =  MHG. {fride}, {g[e:]be}, {nime}; dat. pl. {tagum}, _to days_, {n[a]mum}, _we  took_ = MHG. {tagen}, {n[a]men}.    Nom. sing. masc. {blint[e]r}, _blind_, {uns[e]r}, _our_, {hab[e]n}, _to have_,  {n[e:]m[e]m}, _we may take_ = MHG. {blinder}, {unser}, {haben}, {n[e:]men}.    {sc[o]n[i]}, _beauty_ = MHG. {sch[oe]ne}; {s[a]l[i]g}, _blessed_,  {n[a]m[i]m}, _we might take_ = MHG. {s[ae]lec}, {n[ae]men}.    {salb[o]n}, _to anoint_, {suoht[o]s(t)}, _thou soughtest_, dat. pl.  {g[e:]b[o]m}, {h[e:]rz[o]m} = MHG. {salben}, {suohtes(t)}, {g[e:]ben},  {h[e:]rzen}.    Gen. dat. acc. sing., nom. acc. pl. {zung[u]n} = MHG. {zungen}.      Sec. 8.    The vowel in suffixal and derivative syllables was generally weakened to  {e} just as in the inflexional syllables, but in some suffixal and  derivative syllables which had a secondary accent the vowel was not  weakened to {e}. This was especially the case with derivatives in {-[ae]re}  (denoting nomina agentis), {-inne}, {-inc} ({-ing}), {linc} ({-ling}),  diminutives in {-[i]n} and {-l[i]n}, abstract nouns in {-nisse} ({-nusse},  {-n[u:]sse}), {-unge}. In others the vowel fluctuated between the full  vowel and {e}, as in {-isch} beside {-esch}; {-ic} (= OHG. {-ag}, and  {-[)i]g}) beside {-ec}; superlative of adjectives {-ist} (= OHG. {-ist})  beside {-est} (= OHG. {-[o]st}); {-sal} beside {-sel}. Beside the full  forms {-l[i]ch}, {-r[i]ch} occurred the shortened forms {-lich}, {-rich}.    The OHG. endings of the present participle {-anti}, {-enti}, {-[o]nti},  {[e]nti} regularly became {-ende}, but {-ant} occurs in a few old  participles which had become nouns, as {heilant}, _Saviour_, {w[i]gant},  _warrior_, {v[i]ant} beside {v[i]ent} ({v[i]nt}), _fiend, enemy_. Examples  are: {garten[ae]re}, _gardener_, {schepf[ae]re}, _creator_, {schr[i]b[ae]re},  _scribe_.    {k[u:]neginne}, _queen_, {vriundinne}, _female friend_, {wirtinne},  _mistress_.    {edelinc}, _son of a nobleman_, {hendelinc}, _glove_, {vingerlinc},  _ring_; {m[u:]edinc}, _unhappy man_.    {maged[i]n}, _little girl_, {vinger[i]n}, _ring_; {kindel[i]n}, _little  child_, {vogel[i]n}, _little bird_.    {hindernisse}, _hindrance_, {verd[e:]rbnisse}, _destruction_,  {vinsternisse}, _darkness_, {vancn[u:]sse}, _captivity_.    {be[zz]erunge}, _improvement_, {handelunge}, _action_, {m[e:]ldunge},  _announcement_.    {himelisch}, _heavenly_, {irdisch}, _earthly_, {kindisch}, _childish_,  beside {-esch}.    {heilic} (OHG. {heilag}), _holy_, {honic} (OHG. {honag}, {honig}),  _honey_, {k[u:]nic} (OHG. {cuning}, {cunig}), _king_, {manic} (OHG.  {manag}), _many a_, {s[ae]lic} (OHG. {s[a]l[i]g}), _blessed_, beside {-ec}.    {oberist} beside {oberest}, _highest_.    {kumbersal}, _distress_, {tr[u:]ebsal}, _gloom_, {w[e:]hsal} beside  {w[e:]hsel}, _change_.    {bitterl[i]ch}, _bitterly_, {sicherl[i]ch}, _surely_, {w[i]sl[i]ch}, _wisely_,  beside {-lich}.    {Dietr[i]ch}, {Heinr[i]ch}, beside {-rich}.    The OHG. pronominal ending of the nom. sing. fem. and the nom. acc. pl.  neuter remained unweakened, as OHG. {blintiu} = MHG. {blindiu} (Sec. 55).      2. THE LOSS OF UNACCENTED VOWELS.    Sec. 9.    The weakened {e} regularly disappeared:--    1. After {l} and {r} in dissyllables with short stems, as {ar}, older  {are} (OHG. {aro}), _eagle_, acc. gen. dat. {arn}, beside {name},  _name_, {namen}; {wol}, older {wole} (OHG. {wola}), _well_; {gar} (OHG.  {garo}), _ready_, {milch} (OHG. {milih}), _milk_, {zal} (OHG. {zala}),  _number_; {kil}, _quill_, gen. {kil(e)s}, dat. {kil}, pl. nom. acc.  {kil}, dat. {kil(e)n}, beside {tac}, _day_, gen. {tages}, dat. {tage},  pl. nom. acc. {tage}, dat. {tagen}; {b[e:]rn}, _to bear_, {st[e:]ln}, _to  steal_, {nern}, _to rescue_, pres. sing. {stil}, {stils(t)}, {stilt};  {ner}, {ners(t)}, {nert}, beside {h[oe]ren}, _to hear_, pres. sing. {h[oe]re},  {h[oe]res(t)}, {h[oe]ret}.    2. After liquids and nasals in trisyllabic and polysyllabic forms with  long stems, as {s[ae]lde} (OHG. {s[a]lida}), _blessedness_, {h[e]rsen},  {h[e:]rsen} (OHG. {h[e]ris[o]n}), _to rule_, {zierde} (OHG. {ziarida}),  _adornment_, {wandelte} (OHG. {wantal[o]ta}), _I wandered_, {zw[i]feln}  (OHG. {zw[i]fal[o]n}), _to doubt_, {wundern} (OHG. {wuntar[o]n}), _to wonder_,  {sch[oe]nste} (OHG. {sc[o]nisto}), _most beautiful_, {diente}, {diende} (OHG.  {dion[o]ta}), _I served_; {dienest}, _service_, gen. {dienstes}; {engel},  _angel_, gen. {engel(e)s}, dat. {engel(e)}, pl. nom. acc. gen.  {engel(e)}, dat. {engel(e)n}, and similarly with words like {acker},  _acre_, {l[u]ter}, _clear_, {buosem}, _bosom_, {heiden}, _heathen_;  {gr[oe][z]er} (OHG. {gr[o][z]iro}), _greater_, fem. dat. sing. {gr[oe][z]er}  (OHG. {gr[o][z]iru}); dat. sing. {blindem(e)}, _blind_, {guotem(e)},  _good_ = OHG. {blintemu}, {guotemu}; gen. pl. {blinder(e)} = OHG. {blintero}.  After the analogy of forms with long stems it was also dropped in forms with  short stems, as pl. {nagel}, _nails_, {vogel}, _birds_, beside {nagele},  {vogele}; {wider} beside {widere} (OHG. {widaro}), _wether_, dat. sing.  {disem(e)}, _this_, {vadem(e)}, _thread_, gen. {vadem(e)s}.    There was however a strong tendency in MHG. for the medial vowel to  disappear in trisyllabic forms with long stems irrespectively as to  whether they contained a liquid or a nasal, as {market}, _market_, gen.  {marktes}; {r[i]chsen} (OHG. {r[i]chis[o]n}), _to rule_, {ahte} (OHG.  {aht[o]ta}), _he observed_, {wartte}, {warte} (OHG. {wart[e]ta}), _he  waited_, {vr[a]gte} beside {vr[a]gete} (OHG. {fr[a]g[e]ta}), _he asked_,  {dancte} beside {dankete} (OHG. {dank[o]ta}), _he thanked_. See Sec. 92.    3. In the medial syllable of trisyllabic forms with long stems having  liquids or nasals in successive syllables, as {d[i]me} beside {d[i]neme}  (OHG. {d[i]nemu}), dat. of {d[i]n}, _thy_; {eime} beside {ein(e)me} (OHG.  {einemu}), dat. of {ein}, _one_; {h[e]rre}, {h[e:]rre} (OHG. {h[e]riro}),  _master_; {minre} beside {minner(e)} (OHG. {minniro}), _less_; {tiurre}  (OHG. {tiuriro}), _dearer_.    4. Finally after a nasal, and medially after a nasal before a following  {t}, in forms with short stems, as {han(e)}, _cock_, {nam(e)}, _name_,  {sun} (OHG. {sun}, {sunu}), _son_, {won(e)}, _I dwell_; {man(e)t}, _he  admonishes_, {won(e)t}, _he dwells_, {scham(e)t}, _he shames_,  {nim(e)t}, _he takes_, {n[e:]m(e)t}, _ye take_; pret. {won(e)te},  {scham(e)te}. In these and similar forms the {e} was often restored  through the influence of forms which regularly preserved the {e}.      NOTE.--The {e}, when not preceded by a nasal, was sometimes dropped    in verbal forms ending in {t}. This was especially the case in    {wirst}, {wirt} older {wirdes(t)}, {wirdet}; {siht}, _he sees_,    {s[e:]ht}, _ye see_, older {sihet}, {s[e:]het}; and often in forms like    {gilt}, {vint}, {spricht}, {sticht} beside {giltet}, {vindet},    {sprichet}, {stichet}.    5. The superlative of adjectives often has double forms, the one with  the loss of the medial {e}, and the other with the loss of the final  {e}, as {beste}, _best_, {[e]rste}, _first_, {gr[oe]ste}, _greatest_,  {leste}, _last_, {min(ne)ste}, _least_, {wir(se)ste}, _worst_, beside  {be[zz]est(e)}, {[e]rest(e)}, {gr[oe][z]est(e)}, {le[zz]est(e)}, {minnest(e)},  {wirsest(e)}, OHG. {be[zz]isto}, {[e]risto}, {gr[o][z]isto}, {le[zz]isto},  {minnisto}, {wirsisto}.    6. In the unstressed forms of dissyllables, as adv. {ane}, {abe},  {"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],[0,"Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#3)"],[1,"ents, I have cleared my conscience.\"    Edward, in the quiet of his chamber, glanced at the heading of the  first: _A Dissent from Dissenters or the Comprehension Confuted_. He  felt the weight and thickness of the manuscript, and promptly confuted  their author by consigning the package to that particular corner of his  travelling trunk where he was least likely to come across it again.    On the other hand, his Aunt Rachel warned him with many head-shakings  against the forwardness of the ladies whom he would meet with in  Scotland (where she had never been). Then, more practically, she put  into his hand a purse of broad gold pieces, and set on his finger a  noble diamond ring.    As for Miss Celie Stubbs, she came to the Waverley church on the last  day before his departure, arrayed in all her best and newest clothes,  mighty fine with hoops, patches, and silks everywhere. But Master  Edward, who had his uniform on for the first time, his gold-laced hat  beside him on the cushion, his broadsword by his side, and his spurs on  his heels, hardly once looked at the Squire's pew. At which neglect  little Celie pouted somewhat at the time, but since within six months  she was married to Jones, the steward's son at Waverley-Honour, with  whom she lived happy ever after, we may take it that her heart could not  have been very deeply touched by Edward's inconstancy.           *       *       *       *       *    [As a suitable first taste of the original I now read to my audience  from a pocket _Waverley_, Chapter the Sixth, \"The Adieus of Waverley.\"  It was listened to on the whole with more interest than I had hoped for.  It was an encouraging beginning. But Sir Toady, always irrepressible,  called out a little impatiently: \"That's enough about him. Now tell us  what he _did!_\" And this is how I endeavoured to obey.]        II. THE ENCHANTED CASTLE    Edward Waverley found his regiment quartered at Dundee in Scotland, but,  the time being winter and the people of the neighbourhood not very fond  of the \"red soldiers,\" he did not enjoy the soldiering life so much as  he had expected. So, as soon as the summer was fairly come, he asked  permission to visit the Castle of Bradwardine, in order to pay his  respects to his uncle's friend.    It was noon of the second day after setting out when Edward Waverley  arrived at the village of Tully-Veolan to which he was bound. Never  before had he seen such a place. For, at his uncle's house of  Waverley-Honour, the houses of villagers, all white and neat, stood  about a village green, or lurked ancient and ivy-grown under the shade  of great old park trees. But the turf-roofed hovels of Tully-Veolan,  with their low doors supported on either side by all too intimate piles  of peat and rubbish, appeared to the young Englishman hardly fit for  human beings to live in. Indeed, from the hordes of wretched curs which  barked after the heels of his horse, Edward might have supposed them  meant to serve as kennels--save, that is, for the ragged urchins who  sprawled in the mud of the road and the old women who, distaff in hand,  dashed out to rescue them from being trampled upon by Edward's charger.    Passing gardens as full of nettles as of pot-herbs, and entering between  a couple of gate-posts, each crowned by the image of a rampant bear, the  young soldier at last saw before him, at the end of an avenue, the steep  roofs and crow-stepped gable ends of Bradwardine, half dwelling-house,  half castle. Here Waverley dismounted, and, giving his horse to the  soldier-servant who had accompanied him, he entered a court in which no  sound was to be heard save the plashing of a fountain. He saw the door  of a tall old mansion before him. Going up he raised the knocker, and  instantly the echoes resounded through the empty house. But no one came  to answer. The castle appeared uninhabited, the court a desert. Edward  glanced about him, half expecting to be hailed by some ogre or giant, as  adventurers used to be in the fairy tales he had read in childhood. But  instead he only saw all sorts of bears, big and little, climbing (as it  seemed) on the roof, over the windows, and out upon the ends of the  gables--while over the door at which he had been vainly knocking he read  in antique lettering the motto, \"BEWAR THE BAR.\" But all these bruins  were of stone, and each one of them kept as still and silent as did  everything else about this strange mansion--except, that is, the  fountain, which, behind him in the court, kept up its noisy splashing.    Feeling, somehow, vaguely uncomfortable, Edward Waverley crossed the  court into a garden, green and pleasant, but to the full as solitary as  the castle court. Here again he found more bears, all sitting up in rows  on their haunches, on parapets and along terraces, as if engaged in  looking at the view. He wandered up and down, searching for some one to  whom to speak, and had almost made up his mind that he had found a real  enchanted Castle of Silence, when in the distance he saw a figure  approaching up one of the green walks. There was something uncouth and  strange about the way the newcomer kept waving his hands over his  head--then, for no apparent reason, flapping them across his breast like  a groom on a frosty day, hopping all the time first on one foot and then  on the other. Tiring of this way of getting over the ground, he would  advance by standing leaps, keeping both feet together. The only thing he  seemed quite incapable of doing was to use his feet, one after the  other, as ordinary people do when they are walking. Indeed, this strange  guardian of the enchanted castle of Bradwardine looked like a gnome or  fairy dwarf. For he was clad in an old-fashioned dress of grey, slashed  with scarlet. On his legs were scarlet stockings and on his head a  scarlet cap, which in its turn was surmounted by a turkey's feather.    He came along dancing and singing in jerks and snatches, till, suddenly  looking up from the ground, he saw Edward. In an instant his red cap was  off, and he was bowing and saluting, and again saluting and bowing,  with, if possible, still more extravagant gestures than before. Edward  asked this curious creature if the Baron Bradwardine were at home, and  what was his astonishment to be instantly answered in rhyme:            \"The Knight's to the mountain             His bugle to wind;           The Lady's to greenwood             Her garland to bind.           The bower of Burd Ellen             Has moss on the floor,           That the step of Lord William,             Be silent and sure.\"    This was impressive enough, surely; but, after all, it did not tell  young Captain what he wanted to know. So he continued to question the  strange wight, and finally, after eliciting many unintelligible sounds,  was able to make out the single word \"butler.\"    [Illustration: \"HE came along dancing and singing in jerks and snatches,  till, suddenly looking up from the ground, he saw Edward. In an instant  his red cap was off, and he was bowing and saluting, and again saluting  and bowing, with, if possible, still more extravagant gestures than  before.\"]    Pouncing upon this, Edward commanded the Unknown to lead him instantly  to the butler.    Nothing loath, the fool danced and capered on in front, and, at a  turning of the path, they found an old man, who seemed by his dress to  be half butler, half gardener, digging diligently among the flower beds.  Upon seeing Captain Waverley, he let drop his spade, undid his green  apron, frowning all the time at Edward's guide for bringing his master's  guest upon him without warning, to find him digging up the earth like a  common labourer. But the Bradwardine butler had an explanation ready.    His Honour was with the folk, getting down the Black Hag (so he confided  to Edward). The two gardener lads had been ordered to attend his Honour.  So in order to amuse himself, he, the majordomo of Bradwardine, had been  amusing himself with dressing Miss Rose's flower beds. It was but seldom  that he found time for such like, though personally he was very fond of  garden work.    \"He cannot get it wrought in more than two days a week, at no rate  whatever!\" put in the scarecrow in the red cap and the turkey feather.    \"Go instantly and find his Honour at the Black Hag,\" cried the majordomo  of Bradwardine, wrathful at this interference, \"and tell him that there  is a gentleman come from England waiting him at the Hall.\"    \"Can this poor fellow deliver a letter?\" Edward asked doubtfully.    \"With all fidelity, sir,\" said the butler, \"that is, to any one whom he  respects. After all, he is more knave than fool. We call the innocent  Davie Dolittle, though his proper name is Davie Gellatley. But the truth  is, that since my young mistress, Miss Rose Bradwardine, took a fancy to  dress him up in fine clothes, the creature cannot be got to do a single  hand's turn of work. But here comes Miss Rose herself. Glad will she be  to welcome one of the name of Waverley to her father's house!\"      III. THE BARON AND THE BEAR    Rose Bradwardine was still quite young. Scarce did the tale of her  years number seventeen, but already she was noted over all the  countryside as a pretty girl, with a skin like snow, and hair that  glistened like pale gold when the light fell upon it. Living so far from  society, she was naturally not a little shy. But as soon as her first  feeling of bashfulness was over, Rose spoke freely and brightly. Edward  and she, however, had but little time to be alone together. For it was  not long before the Baron of Bradwardine appeared, striding toward them  as if he had possessed himself of the giant's seven-league boots.  Bradwardine was a tall, thin, soldierly man, who in his time had seen  much of the world, and who under a hard and even stern exterior, hid a  heart naturally warm.    He was much given to the singing of French songs and to making long and"]]]
