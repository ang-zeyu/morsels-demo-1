A Register of the Gang, [Reading.]  Crook-finger'd _Jack_. A Year and a half in the Service; Let me see how  much the Stock owes to his industry; one, two, three, four, five Gold  Watches, and seven Silver ones. A mighty clean-handed Fellow! Sixteen  Snuff-boxes, five of them of true Gold. Six Dozen of Handkerchiefs, four  silver-hilted Swords, half a Dozen of Shirts, three Tye-Periwigs, and a  Piece of Broad-Cloth. Considering these are only the Fruits of his  leisure Hours, I don't know a prettier Fellow, for no Man alive hath a  more engaging Presence of Mind upon the Road. _Wat Dreary_, alias _Brown  Will_, an irregular Dog, who hath an underhand way of disposing of his  Goods. I'll try him only for a Sessions or two longer upon his  Good-behaviour. _Harry Paddington_, a poor petty-larceny Rascal, without  the least Genius; that Fellow, though he were to live these six Months,  will never come to the Gallows with any Credit. Slippery _Sam_; he goes  off the next Sessions, for the Villain hath the Impudence to have Views  of following his Trade as a Tailor, which he calls an honest Employment.  _Mat of the Mint_; listed not above a Month ago, a promising sturdy  Fellow, and diligent in his way; somewhat too bold and hasty, and may  raise good Contributions on the Public, if he does not cut himself short  by Murder. _Tom Tipple_, a guzzling soaking Sot, who is always too drunk  to stand himself, or to make others stand. A Cart is absolutely  necessary for him. _Robin of Bagshot_, alias _Gorgon_, alias _Bluff  Bob_, alias _Carbuncle_, alias _Bob Booty_.      Enter _Mrs. Peachum_.    _Mrs. Peachum._ What of _Bob Booty_, Husband? I hope nothing bad hath  betided him. You know, my Dear, he's a favourite Customer of mine. 'Twas  he made me a present of this Ring.    _Peachum._ I have set his Name down in the Black List, that's all, my  Dear; he spends his Life among Women, and as soon as his Money is gone,  one or other of the Ladies will hang him for the Reward, and there's  forty Pound lost to us for-ever.    _Mrs. Peachum._ You know, my Dear, I never meddle in matters of Death;  I always leave those Affairs to you. Women indeed are bitter bad Judges  in these cases, for they are so partial to the Brave that they think  every Man handsome who is going to the Camp or the Gallows.      AIR III. Cold and raw, &c.    [Music]      If any Wench _Venus's_ Girdle wear,      Though she be never so ugly;    Lilies and Roses will quickly appear,      And her Face look wond'rous smugly.    Beneath the left Ear so fit but a Cord,      (A Rope so charming a Zone is!)    The Youth in his Cart hath the Air of a Lord,      And we cry, There dies an _Adonis_!    But really, Husband, you should not be too hard-hearted, for you never  had a finer, braver set of Men than at present. We have not had a Murder  among them all, these seven Months. And truly, my Dear, that is a great  Blessing.    _Peachum._ What a dickens is the Woman always a whimpring about Murder  for? No Gentleman is ever look'd upon the worse for killing a Man in his  own Defence; and if Business cannot be carried on without it, what would  you have a Gentleman do?    _Mrs. Peachum._ If I am in the wrong, my Dear, you must excuse me, for  no body can help the Frailty of an over-scrupulous Conscience.    _Peachum._ Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of.  How many fine Gentlemen have we in _Newgate_ every Year, purely upon  that Article! If they have wherewithal to persuade the Jury to bring it  in Manslaughter, what are they the worse for it? So, my Dear, have done  upon this Subject. Was Captain _Macheath_ here this Morning, for the  Bank-Notes he left with you last Week?    _Mrs. Peachum._ Yes, my Dear; and though the Bank hath stopt Payment, he  was so chearful and so agreeable! Sure there is not a finer Gentleman  upon the Road than the Captain! if he comes from _Bagshot_ at any  reasonable Hour, he hath promis'd to make one this Evening with _Polly_  and me, and _Bob Booty_ at a Party of Quadrille. Pray, my Dear, is the  Captain rich?    _Peachum._ The Captain keeps too good Company ever to grow rich.  _Marybone_ and the Chocolate-houses are his Undoing. The Man that  proposes to get Money by play should have the Education of a fine  Gentleman, and be train'd up to it from his Youth.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Really, I am sorry upon _Polly's_ Account the Captain  hath not more Discretion. What Business hath he to keep Company with  Lords and Gentlemen? he should leave them to prey upon one another.    _Peachum._ Upon _Polly's_ Account! What, a Plague, does the Woman mean?  --Upon _Polly's_ Account!    _Mrs. Peachum._ Captain _Macheath_ is very fond of the Girl.    _Peachum._ And what then?    _Mrs. Peachum._ If I have any Skill in the Ways of Women, I am sure  _Polly_ thinks him a very pretty Man.    _Peachum._ And what then? You would not be so mad to have the Wench  marry him! Gamesters and Highwaymen are generally very good to their  Whores, but they are very Devils to their Wives.    _Mrs. Peachum._ But if _Polly_ should be in Love, how should we help  her, or how can she help herself? Poor Girl, I am in the utmost Concern  about her.      AIR IV. Why is your faithful Slave disdain'd? &c.    [Music]      If Love the Virgin's Heart invade,    How, like a Moth, the simple Maid      Still plays about the Flame!    If soon she be not made a Wife,    Her Honour's sing'd, and then for Life,      She's-- what I dare not name.    _Peachum._ Look ye, Wife. A handsome Wench in our way of Business is as  profitable as at the Bar of a _Temple_ Coffee-House, who looks upon it  as her livelihood to grant every Liberty but one. You see I would  indulge the Girl as far as prudently we can. In any thing, but Marriage!  After that, my Dear, how shall we be safe? Are we not then in her  Husband's Power? For a Husband hath the absolute Power over all a Wife's  Secrets but her own. If the Girl had the Discretion of a Court-Lady, who  can have a Dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one,  I should not matter it; but _Polly_ is Tinder, and a Spark will at once  set her on a Flame. Married! If the Wench does not know her own Profit,  sure she knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property!  My Daughter to me should be, like a Court-Lady to a Minister of State,  a Key to the whole Gang. Married! If the Affair is not already done,  I'll terrify her from it, by the Example of our Neighbours.    _Mrs. Peachum._ May-hap, my Dear, you may injure the Girl. She loves to  imitate the fine Ladies, and she may only allow the Captain Liberties in  the view of Interest.    _Peachum._ But 'tis your Duty, my Dear, to warn the Girl against her  Ruin, and to instruct her how to make the most of her Beauty. I'll go to  her this moment, and sift her. In the meantime, Wife, rip out the  Coronets and Marks of these Dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs, for I can  dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the City.        [Exit _Peachum_.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Never was a Man more out of the way in an Argument than  my Husband! Why must our _Polly_, forsooth, differ from her Sex, and  love only her Husband? And why must _Polly's_ Marriage, contrary to all  Observations, make her the less followed by other Men? All Men are  Thieves in Love, and like a Woman the better for being another's  Property.      AIR V. Of all the simple Things we do, &c.    [Music]      A Maid is like the Golden Ore,      Which hath Guineas intrinsical in't,    Whose Worth is never known before      It is try'd and imprest in the Mint.    A Wife's like a Guinea in Gold,      Stampt with the Name of her Spouse;    Now here, now there; is bought, or is sold;      And is current in every House.      Enter _Filch_.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Come hither, _Filch_. I am as fond of this Child, as  though my Mind misgave me he were my own. He hath as fine a Hand at  picking a Pocket as a Woman, and is as nimble-finger'd as a Juggler. If  an unlucky Session does not cut the Rope of thy Life, I pronounce, Boy,  thou wilt be a great Man in History. Where was your Post last Night, my  Boy?    _Filch._ I ply'd at the Opera, Madam; and considering 'twas neither dark  nor rainy, so that there was no great Hurry in getting Chairs and  Coaches, made a tolerable Hand on't. These seven Handkerchiefs, Madam.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Colour'd ones, I see. They are of sure Sale from our  Warehouse at _Redriff_ among the Seamen.    _Filch._ And this Snuff-box.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Set in Gold! A pretty Encouragement this to a young  Beginner.    _Filch._ I had a fair Tug at a charming Gold Watch. Pox take the Tailors  for making the Fobs so deep and narrow! It stuck by the way, and I was  forc'd to make my Escape under a Coach. Really, Madam, I fear I shall be  cut off in the Flower of my Youth, so that every now and then (since I  was pumpt) I have Thoughts of taking up and going to Sea.    _Mrs. Peachum._ You should go to _Hockley in the Hole_, and to  _Marybone_, Child, to learn Valour. These are the Schools that have bred  so many brave Men. I thought, Boy, by this time, thou hadst lost Fear as  well as Shame.

But the young man  had his own plans, and went to the Leader and asked permission to go  and look at the enemy. With many cautions not to give an alarm and  prevent surprise, the Leader consented, and off Ish'-i-buz-zhi  started.    \"Catching sight of the enemy, he threw away his bow, and, armed only  with his club, rushed suddenly upon the foremost man, overthrew and  killed him. When the war party came upon the scene, they saw with  amazement what he had done,--how by the might of his single arm he had  killed the Leader of the enemy and scattered his warriors.    \"On the return of the Omaha men to their village the Herald, according  to custom, proclaimed the deed of Ish'-i-buz-zhi. The old mother  sitting in her tent heard his words, and called to her husband:    \"'What is this that I hear? Go you out and learn the truth.'    \"'It is only their ridicule of our boy,' said the old man, loath to  stir.    \"The Herald cried again, and the old man arose and stood at the door  of the tent. Then of a truth he learned that, single-handed, his son  had vanquished the enemy. Again and again did Ish'-i-buz-zhi join war  parties, and he was always the foremost to meet the enemy and to  scatter them with his club.    \"Many tales are told of him; for he was fond of joking, and was often  absent-minded. It is said that his wife was skilled in embroidery, and  would decorate his moccasins with fine porcupine quill work; and it  disturbed her to see him put them on to go out of a morning when the  dew was on the grass. So she took him to task for his thoughtlessness.    \"'While the grass is wet,'\" said she, \"'carry your moccasins in your  belt.'    \"He obeyed; but he forgot to put them on when the grass was dry, and  came home with feet bruised and sore, and his moccasins still in his  belt.    \"But these peculiarities no longer provoked ridicule, as when  Ish'-i-buz-zhi was a boy; for as a man, generous and strong, he was  beloved by the people. The child who had feasted on tales of the  old heroes had in his manhood reproduced their brave deeds. So it came  to pass that, when danger threatened, it was to him that the people  ran for help; and he never failed them.\"    The song refers to one of these appeals. An alarm arose, and to  Ish'-i-buz-zhi, sitting in his tent, the people cried, \"The enemy  comes and calls for you, Ish'-i-buz-zhi.\"    [Music: DANCE SONG. (ICHIBUZZHI.)    _Omaha.

After many years of warfare the Omaha tribe made peace with the Sioux.  One bright autumn day it was suggested that, in order to show their  friendly feeling, a party of Omahas should visit the Sioux tribe. So  the men and women made everything ready for the long journey.    Tent covers and camp belongings were fastened on trailing travaux,  ponies were laden with gayly painted parfleche packs, containing the  fine garments of the people and the gifts to be presented to the  Sioux. Soon the motley-coloured line could be seen winding over the  rolling prairie. The young men, mounted on their spirited horses,  dashed off, racing with each other to attract the attention of the  maidens, who could only follow with their eyes, so closely guarded  were they by the elder women. Old men jogged along in groups, talking  to each other, their lariats dragging through the grass, now and then  snapping off the head of a wild flower or catching in a tangle of  weeds. Boys made the air ring with their laughter, as they slipped off  their ponies to shoot their small arrows at some imaginary game. It  was a scene full of careless pleasure and happy movement under a  cloudless sky.    When nearing the Sioux village, the people paused beside a stream to  wash off the dust of travel, to put on their gayest attire, and to  newly paint their hair and faces. The prairie was their vast  dressing-room, and friendly eyes were their mirrors. Young men decked  each other, and girls slyly put on touches of finery. Every one was  moving about and busy, from the oldest man to the youngster captured  from play to be washed and painted. At last the transformation was  complete, from the dun, every-day colour to the brilliant hues of a  gala time. Now messengers were despatched with small bunches of  tobacco, tied up in bits of bladder skin (in lieu of visiting cards),  to give notice of the visiting party's approach.    Suddenly some one asked, \"What if the Sioux do not believe we are  coming in peace, and should capture our messengers and attack us as we  come near with our women and children?\"    Such a reception had not before been thought of; and silence fell upon  the people as they halted, under the gloom of the apprehension. At  length the Leader stood up and said,--\"We have made peace, we have  come in good faith, we will go forward, and Wa-ko_n_'-da shall decide  the issue.\"    Then he struck up this song and led the way; and, as the men and women  followed, they caught the tune, and all sang it as they came near the  Sioux village.    In the words the Leader, as representing the Omahas, speaks: \"I am  advancing. I am moving toward you. Behold me, young men, warriors of  the Sioux! Here I stand. Wa-ko_n_'-da alone decides the destinies of  men.\"    The visitors met with a welcome, and the breach between the two tribes  was healed for many a long day.    [Music: SONG OF THE LEADER.

According to the Omaha idea, a child during its infancy had no  recognised existence as an individual or distinct member of the tribe,  but remained as a part of its parents. When it could walk alone, at  about three years of age, it was initiated into the tribal  organisation through certain religious rites; but its responsible and  individual life did not begin until its mind had \"become white,\" as  the Indians say. This expression referred to the dawn, to the passing  of night into day, and represented the coming of the child out of the  period where nothing was clearly apprehended into a time when he could  readily recall past events with their distinctness of detail. This  seeming mastery of the minutiae of passing occurrences indicated that a  stage of growth had been reached where the youth could be inducted  into the religious mysteries through a distinct personal experience  acquired in the rite, No_n_'-zhi_n_-zho_n_,--a rite which brought him  into what was believed to be direct communication with the  supernatural powers.    In preparation for this rite the Omaha youth was taught the Tribal  Prayer. He was to sing it during the four nights and days of his  vigil in some lonely place. As he left his home, his parents put clay  on his head; and, to teach him self-control, they placed a bow and  arrows in his hand, with the injunction not to use them during his  long fast, no matter how great the temptation might be. He was bidden  to weep as he sang the prayer, and to wipe his tears with the palms of  his hands, to lift his wet hands to heaven, and then lay them on the  earth. With these instructions the youth departed, to enter upon the  trial of his endurance. When at last he fell into a sleep or trance,  and the vision came, of bird, or beast, or cloud, bringing with it a  cadence, this song became ever after the medium of communication  between the man and the mysterious power typified in his vision; and  by it he summoned help and strength in the hour of his need.    In this manner all mystery songs originated,--the songs sung when  healing plants were gathered and when the medicine was administered;  when a man set his traps or hunted for game; when he desired to look  into the future or sought supernatural guidance, or deliverance from  impending danger.    The Tribal Prayer was called in the Omaha tongue Wa-ko_n_'-da  gi-ko_n_: Wa-ko_n_'-da, the power which could make or bring to pass;  gi-ko_n_, to weep from conscious insufficiency, or the longing for  something that could bring happiness or prosperity. The words of the  prayer, Wa-ko_n_'-da dhe-dhu wah-pa'-dhi_n_ a-to_n_'-he, literally  rendered, are, Wa-ko_n_'-da, here needy he stands; and I am he.    This prayer is very old. Its supplicating cadences echoed through the  forests of this land long before our race had touched its shores,  voicing a cry recognised by every human heart.    [Music: THE OMAHA TRIBAL PRAYER.

The  following is an example.
