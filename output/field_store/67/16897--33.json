I take the same pride in the place Sandy  does. We have won a reputation here for doing things the way they ought  to be done--for minding the laws--for having clean, healthy stock. Sandy  says he shall dip his herd, anyway.\"    \"Bother Sandy! He's talked to you men until he's got you all upset. You  would have been with me if he had kept his mouth shut. But no matter  what he says I am running this ranch at present. I mean to run it in the  future, too. If you're wise you will do as I tell you.\"    \"Mr. Clark may have something to say about the dipping.\"    \"Don't you fret,\" sneered Thornton. \"I sounded him last night. He's a  tenderfoot. I don't believe he knows a thing about sheeping.\"    Mr. Clark drew Donald into the sun-flooded field before he spoke.    Then, after a thoughtful silence he turned:    \"Well, Don?\"    \"I wouldn't have that Thornton here another day, father!\" broke out the  boy hotly.    \"Slowly, son, slowly! We must be sure about Thornton before we condemn  him. He has been ten years on the ranch; more than that, we are without  a manager, and we have none in view. Remember 'he stumbles who runs  fast.' Take time, Don, take time.\"    Donald flushed.    \"I know it is the best way, but I was so angry to hear him talking that  way about you.\"    \"Loyalty is a fine trait, Don.\" Mr. Clark laid his hand affectionately  on his son's shoulder. \"I like to see you loyal. But in this matter we  must move slowly.\"    \"What about this dipping, father? What is it?\"    \"Something about washing the sheep. I do not clearly understand it  myself.\"    \"Shall you have it done?\"    \"What do you say?\"    \"Of course I do not know anything about it,\" Donald replied modestly,  \"but somehow I feel as if Sandy and the men are right.\"    \"I think so too.\"    \"Couldn't I ask Sandy what it is, father?\"    \"I am thinking of asking him myself, Don, if I get a good chance.\"    The chance came unexpectedly, for at that very moment Sandy McCulloch  came out of one of the sheep-pens and crossed the walk to the central  barn.    \"What are you up to to-day, Sandy?\" called Mr. Clark.    \"I am going to dip my flock, sir, down in the south meadow.\"    \"I am glad of that, for it will give us a chance to see it done,\"  observed Mr. Clark. Then lowering his voice he asked: \"Why do you dip  the sheep, Sandy?\"    \"Are you asking because you want to know?\" inquired Sandy with the  directness which characterized everything he said.    \"Yes, Both Donald and I wish to learn.\"    \"Well, sir, it is this way. After the shearing is over and the fleece  removed, the coat of the sheep is light and therefore easily dried. We  then take the flocks and run them through a bath of lime and sulphur.  Some shepherds prefer a coal-tar dip. Whatever the dip is made of, the  purpose is the same. It is to kill the parasites on the sheep and cure  any diseases of the eyes. If sheep are not dipped they get the 'scab.'  Some bit of a creature gets under their skin and burrows until it makes  the sheep sick. Often, too, the wool will peel off in great patches. One  sheep will take it from another, until by and by the whole herd is  infected.\"    Mr. Clark nodded.    \"I never mean to let a sickly sheep go on the range,\" continued Sandy.  \"I try to flax round and find out what is the matter with him so I can  cure him. We don't want our herd spoiling the feeding grounds and the  water-holes and giving their diseases to all the flocks that graze after  them. If we are let graze on the range the least we can do is to be  decent about it--that's the way I look at it.\"    \"Have our sheep always been dipped?\"    \"Aye, sir, that they have--dipped every spring after shearing; then we  clipped their feet before they started for the range. Sheep, you know,  walk on two toes, and if their feet are not trimmed they get sore from  traveling so much. I suppose nature intended sheep to climb over the  rocks and wear their hoofs down that way. They have a queer foot. Did  you know that there is a little oily gland between the toes to make the  hoof moist, and keep it from cracking?\"    \"No, I guess neither Donald nor I knew that, did we, Donald? Now about  this dipping--do you thoroughly understand how it is done, Sandy?\"    \"I do that, sir.\"    Donald wondered why his father was so thoughtful.    \"How long have you been at Crescent Ranch, Sandy?\" asked Mr. Clark at  last.    \"Ever since I was a lad of fifteen, sir.\"    \"That must be about ten years!\"    \"Fourteen.\"    A new thought came to Mr. Clark.    \"Why, then you must have known Old Angus,\" he exclaimed.    \"I did, sir.\"    \"He was a fine old man, they tell me.\"    \"He was.\"    \"I never saw him--I wish I had. It was a great loss to the ranch and to  all of us when he went.\"    \"It was indeed.\"    \"You must remember him well, Sandy.\"    Throwing back his head with a gesture of pride, Sandy confronted Mr.  Clark.    \"I do, sir,\" he replied simply. \"He was my father.\"    Mr. Clark and Donald stared.    \"Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?\" cried Donald's father,  stepping forward eagerly and seizing the hand of the young ranchman.    \"I thought mayhap you knew it. If not--why prate about it? It's on my  own feet I must stand and not on my father's. If I am of any use you  will find it out fast enough, father or no father; if I'm not 'twere  best you found that out as well.\"    \"Independent as your forebears, Sandy!\" laughed Mr. Clark.    \"I be a McCulloch, sir!\" was all Sandy said.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER III    THE DIPPING      It was a great surprise to Tom Thornton when Mr. Clark informed him that  he wanted the men to start in dipping the sheep as soon as they could  get ready.    \"I suppose, Thornton, you have everything in readiness for the work,\"  continued the owner casually.    Thornton did not hesitate.    \"Yes, indeed, sir. We can start right in to-day if you wish. It is for  you to say. But really, Mr. Clark, the flock hardly needs it. Our sheep  are in prime condition.\"    \"That's all the more reason for keeping them so, Thornton,\" was the  smiling reply.    \"Of course that is true, sir. Very well. We will go ahead. I think I  shall have time to give the orders, although I have got to be in Glen  City about ten days shipping the clip.\"    \"What?\"    \"Shipping the wool, sir.\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"I can start the work before I go.\"    \"I don't think you need bother, Thornton,\" remarked Mr. Clark slowly.  \"You go on down to Glen City and finish up your business there.\"    \"But somebody must see to the dipping if you really want it done.\"    \"I'll attend to it.\"    \"You!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Why--why--nothing, sir. I beg your pardon. Only I thought you might be  too tired after your trip.\"    \"Oh, no. I am not tired at all.\"    Thornton eyed him.    Even Donald was astonished.    Mr. Clark did not seem to be at all disturbed by the embarrassing  stillness, but went on shaving down a stick he was whittling.    \"I do not mean to manage the dipping myself,\" he explained at last. \"I  shall let Sandy McCulloch take charge of it.\"    \"Sandy McCulloch! Why, sir, that boy could never do it in the world! He  is a good lad--well enough in his way--but not very smart. Not at all  like his father.\"    \"Well, if he has no ability I shall soon find it out. I mean to try him,  anyway.\"    \"Oh, you can try him if you like, but I know the fellow better than you  do. You are foolish to turn any big work over to him. He can't handle  it.\"    \"I intend to give him the chance.\"    Thornton's annoyance began to get beyond his control.    \"Very well. It is not my business,\" he snapped as he left the room.    The instant he was gone Donald, who could not keep silent another  moment, cried:    \"Oh, father! I am so glad you are going to let Sandy manage the  dipping!\"    \"It is an experiment, Don. Sandy is young and he may make a mess of  things--not because he does not mean well, but because he lacks  experience. He has been here a long time, to be sure, but he never has  taken any care beyond watching his own flocks.\"    \"I do not think he will fail. The men will all help him. They like him.\"    \"I can see that.\"    \"And I like him too, father.\"    \"So do I, son. I am trusting him with this work not only because I like  him but because I feel sure that the son of such a father cannot go far  astray. It was a great surprise to me when I found Sandy was the son of  Old Angus. You see we all thought so much of the old Scotchman that he  was Old Angus to everybody. I had almost forgotten he had another name.  I don't think I ever heard any one call him Angus McCulloch in my life.  And yet I remember the name now, for I can recall seeing it written out  on checks and letters.\"    \"It is a fine name,\" Donald declared.    \"Sandy comes of good stock. I want to help him all I can. If he has the  right stuff in him perhaps we can give him a lift. I wish we might, for  I feel we owe his father more than we ever can repay.\"    It was great news to Sandy when he learned that not only was he to dip  his own flock, but that into his hands was to be put the dipping of the  entire herd.    \"I'm no so sure I can manage it, Mr. Clark,\" he said modestly, lapsing,  as he often did, into his broad Scotch. \"I'll do the best I can though,  sir.\"    \"I am sure you will.\"    And Sandy did do his best!    The hot dip, with the proper proportions of lime and sulphur, was  prepared, and Sandy tested its temperature by seeing if he could bear  his hand in it. Then the long cement troughs were filled. These troughs  were just wide enough so the sheep were not able to turn. Groups of  sheep that had been driven from the larger enclosures to the small pens  near the dipping troughs were then hurried, one by one, to the men  standing at the head of the troughs; it was the duty of these men to  push each sheep in turn down the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#3)"],[1,"4)  Made ready answer: \"Hermit, where  Are graces found so high and rare?  Yet listen, and my tongue shall tell  In whom alone these virtues dwell.  From old Ikshvaku's(15) line he came,  Known to the world by Rama's name:  With soul subdued, a chief of might,  In Scripture versed, in glory bright,  His steps in virtue's paths are bent,  Obedient, pure, and eloquent.  In each emprise he wins success,  And dying foes his power confess.  Tall and broad-shouldered, strong of limb,  Fortune has set her mark on him.  Graced with a conch-shell's triple line,  His throat displays the auspicious sign.(16)  High destiny is clear impressed  On massive jaw and ample chest,  His mighty shafts he truly aims,  And foemen in the battle tames.  Deep in the muscle, scarcely shown,  Embedded lies his collar-bone.  His lordly steps are firm and free,  His strong arms reach below his knee;(17)  All fairest graces join to deck  His head, his brow, his stately neck,  And limbs in fair proportion set:  The manliest form e'er fashioned yet.  Graced with each high imperial mark,  His skin is soft and lustrous dark.  Large are his eyes that sweetly shine  With majesty almost divine.  His plighted word he ne'er forgets;  On erring sense a watch he sets.  By nature wise, his teacher's skill  Has trained him to subdue his will.  Good, resolute and pure, and strong,  He guards mankind from scathe and wrong,  And lends his aid, and ne'er in vain,  The cause of justice to maintain.  Well has he studied o'er and o'er  The Vedas(18)and their kindred lore.  Well skilled is he the bow to draw,(19)  Well trained in arts and versed in law;  High-souled and meet for happy fate,  Most tender and compassionate;  The noblest of all lordly givers,  Whom good men follow, as the rivers  Follow the King of Floods, the sea:  So liberal, so just is he.  The joy of Queen Kausalya's(20)heart,  In every virtue he has part:  Firm as Himalaya's(21) snowy steep,  Unfathomed like the mighty deep:  The peer of Vishnu's power and might,  And lovely as the Lord of Night;(22)  Patient as Earth, but, roused to ire,  Fierce as the world-destroying fire;  In bounty like the Lord of Gold,(23)  And Justice self in human mould.      With him, his best and eldest son,  By all his princely virtues won  King Dasaratha(24) willed to share  His kingdom as the Regent Heir.  But when Kaikeyi, youngest queen,  With eyes of envious hate had seen  The solemn pomp and regal state  Prepared the prince to consecrate,  She bade the hapless king bestow  Two gifts he promised long ago,  That Rama to the woods should flee,  And that her child the heir should be.      By chains of duty firmly tied,  The wretched king perforce complied.  Rama, to please Kaikeyi went  Obedient forth to banishment.  Then Lakshman's truth was nobly shown,  Then were his love and courage known,  When for his brother's sake he dared  All perils, and his exile shared.  And Sita, Rama's darling wife,  Loved even as he loved his life,  Whom happy marks combined to bless,  A miracle of loveliness,  Of Janak's royal lineage sprung,  Most excellent of women, clung  To her dear lord, like Rohini  Rejoicing with the Moon to be.(25)  The King and people, sad of mood,  The hero's car awhile pursued.  But when Prince Rama lighted down  At Sringavera's pleasant town,  Where Ganga's holy waters flow,  He bade his driver turn and go.  Guha, Nishadas' king, he met,  And on the farther bank was set.  Then on from wood to wood they strayed,  O'er many a stream, through constant shade,  As Bharadvaja bade them, till  They came to Chitrakuta's hill.  And Rama there, with Lakshman's aid,  A pleasant little cottage made,  And spent his days with Sita, dressed  In coat of bark and deerskin vest.(26)  And Chitrakuta grew to be  As bright with those illustrious three  As Meru's(27) sacred peaks that shine  With glory, when the Gods recline  Beneath them: Siva's(28) self between  The Lord of Gold and Beauty's Queen.      The aged king for Rama pined,  And for the skies the earth resigned.  Bharat, his son, refused to reign,  Though urged by all the twice-born(29) train.  Forth to the woods he fared to meet  His brother, fell before his feet,  And cried, \"Thy claim all men allow:  O come, our lord and king be thou.\"  But Rama nobly chose to be  Observant of his sire's decree.  He placed his sandals(30) in his hand  A pledge that he would rule the land:  And bade his brother turn again.  Then Bharat, finding prayer was vain,  The sandals took and went away;  Nor in Ayodhya would he stay.  But turned to Nandigrama, where  He ruled the realm with watchful care,  Still longing eagerly to learn  Tidings of Rama's safe return.      Then lest the people should repeat  Their visit to his calm retreat,  Away from Chitrakuta's hill  Fared Rama ever onward till  Beneath the shady trees he stood  Of Dandaka's primeval wood,  Viradha, giant fiend, he slew,  And then Agastya's friendship knew.  Counselled by him he gained the sword  And bow of Indra, heavenly lord:  A pair of quivers too, that bore  Of arrows an exhaustless store.  While there he dwelt in greenwood shade  The trembling hermits sought his aid,  And bade him with his sword and bow  Destroy the fiends who worked them woe:  To come like Indra strong and brave,  A guardian God to help and save.  And Rama's falchion left its trace  Deep cut on Surpanakha's face:  A hideous giantess who came  Burning for him with lawless flame.  Their sister's cries the giants heard.  And vengeance in each bosom stirred:  The monster of the triple head.  And Dushan to the contest sped.  But they and myriad fiends beside  Beneath the might of Rama died.      When Ravan, dreaded warrior, knew  The slaughter of his giant crew:  Ravan, the king, whose name of fear  Earth, hell, and heaven all shook to hear:  He bade the fiend Maricha aid  The vengeful plot his fury laid.  In vain the wise Maricha tried  To turn him from his course aside:  Not Ravan's self, he said, might hope  With Rama and his strength to cope.  Impelled by fate and blind with rage  He came to Rama's hermitage.  There, by Maricha's magic art,  He wiled the princely youths apart,  The vulture(31) slew, and bore away  The wife of Rama as his prey.  The son of Raghu(32) came and found  Jatayu slain upon the ground.  He rushed within his leafy cot;  He sought his wife, but found her not.  Then, then the hero's senses failed;  In mad despair he wept and wailed.  Upon the pile that bird he laid,  And still in quest of Sita strayed.  A hideous giant then he saw,  Kabandha named, a shape of awe.  The monstrous fiend he smote and slew,  And in the flame the body threw;  When straight from out the funeral flame  In lovely form Kabandha came,  And bade him seek in his distress  A wise and holy hermitess.  By counsel of this saintly dame  To Pampa's pleasant flood he came,  And there the steadfast friendship won  Of Hanuman the Wind-God's son.  Counselled by him he told his grief  To great Sugriva, Vanar chief,  Who, knowing all the tale, before  The sacred flame alliance swore.  Sugriva to his new-found friend  Told his own story to the end:  His hate of Bali for the wrong  And insult he had borne so long.  And Rama lent a willing ear  And promised to allay his fear.  Sugriva warned him of the might  Of Bali, matchless in the fight,  And, credence for his tale to gain,  Showed the huge fiend(33) by Bali slain.  The prostrate corse of mountain size  Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes;  He lightly kicked it, as it lay,  And cast it twenty leagues(34) away.  To prove his might his arrows through  Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew.  He cleft a mighty hill apart,  And down to hell he hurled his dart.  Then high Sugriva's spirit rose,  Assured of conquest o'er his foes.  With his new champion by his side  To vast Kishkindha's cave he hied.  Then, summoned by his awful shout,  King Bali came in fury out,  First comforted his trembling wife,  Then sought Sugriva in the strife.  One shaft from Rama's deadly bow  The monarch in the dust laid low.  Then Rama bade Sugriva reign  In place of royal Bali slain.  Then speedy envoys hurried forth  Eastward and westward, south and north,  Commanded by the grateful king  Tidings of Rama's spouse to bring.      Then by Sampati's counsel led,  Brave Hanuman, who mocked at dread,  Sprang at one wild tremendous leap  Two hundred leagues across the deep.  To Lanka's(35) town he urged his way,  Where Ravan held his royal sway.  There pensive 'neath Asoka(36) boughs  He found poor Sita, Rama's spouse.  He gave the hapless girl a ring,  A token from her lord and king.  A pledge from her fair hand he bore;  Then battered down the garden door.  Five captains of the host he slew,  Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew;  Crushed youthful Aksha on the field,  Then to his captors chose to yield.  Soon from their bonds his limbs were free,  But honouring the high decree  Which Brahma(37) had pronounced of yore,  He calmly all their insults bore.  The town he burnt with hostile flame,  And spoke again with Rama's dame,  Then swiftly back to Rama flew  With tidings of the interview.      Then with Sugriva for his guide,  Came Rama to the ocean side.  He smote the sea with shafts as bright  As sunbeams in their summer height,  And quick appeared the Rivers' King(38)  Obedient to the summoning.  A bridge was thrown by Nala o'er  The narrow sea from shore to shore.(39)  They crossed to Lanka's golden town,  Where Rama's hand smote Ravan down.  Vibhishan there was left to reign  Over his brother's wide domain.  To meet her husband Sita came;  But Rama, stung with ire and shame,  With bitter words his wife addressed  Before the crowd that round her pressed.  But Sita, touched with noble ire,  Gave her fair body to the fire.  Then straight the God of Wind appeared,  And words from heaven her honour cleared.  And Rama clasped his wife again,  Uninjured, pure from spot and stain,  Obedient to the Lord of Fire  And the high mandate of his sire.  Led "]]]
