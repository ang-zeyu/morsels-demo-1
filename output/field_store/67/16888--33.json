[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#3)"],[1," which, of earlier  date than the surviving poem, can in a measure be reconstructed from  the Chronicle of Turpin and from a Latin _Carmen de proditione  Guenonis_. These, however, do not detract from the originality of  the noble work in our possession, some of the most striking episodes  of which are not elsewhere found. The oldest manuscript is at Oxford,  and the last line has been supposed to give the author's  name--Touroude (Latinised \"Turoldus\")--but this may have been the  name of the jongleur who sang, or the transcriber who copied. The  date of the poem lies between that of the battle of Hastings, 1066,  where the minstrel Taillefer sang in other words the deeds of Roland,  and the year 1099. The poet was probably a Norman, and he may have  been one of the Norman William's followers in the invasion of England.    More than any other poem, the _Chanson de Roland_ deserves to be named  the Iliad of the Middle Ages. On August 15, 778, the rearguard of  Charlemagne's army, returning from a successful expedition to the  north of Spain, was surprised and destroyed by Basque mountaineers  in the valley of Roncevaux. Among those who fell was Hrodland (Roland),  Count of the march of Brittany. For Basques, the singers substituted  a host of Saracens, who, after promise of peace, treacherously attack  the Franks, with the complicity of Roland's enemy, the traitor Ganelon.  By Roland's side is placed his companion-in-arms, Olivier, brave but  prudent, brother of Roland's betrothed, _la belle Aude_, who learns  her lover's death, and drops dead at the feet of Charlemagne. In fact  but thirty-six years of age, Charlemagne is here a majestic old man,  _a la barbe fleurie_, still full of heroic vigour. Around him are  his great lords--Duke Naime, the Nestor of this Iliad; Archbishop  Turpin, the warrior prelate; Oger the Dane; the traitor Ganelon. And  overhead is God, who will send his angels to bear heavenwards the  soul of the gallant Roland. The idea of the poem is at once national  and religious--the struggle between France, as champion of  Christendom, and the enemies of France and of God. Its spirit is that  of the feudal aristocracy of the eleventh century. The characters  are in some degree representative of general types, but that of Roland  is clearly individualised; the excess of soldierly pride which will  not permit him, until too late, to sound his horn and recall  Charlemagne to his aid, is a glorious fault. When all his comrades  have fallen, he still continues the strife; and when he dies, it is  with his face to the retreating foe. His fall is not unavenged on  the Saracens and on the traitor. The poem is written in decasyllabic  verse--in all 4000 lines--divided into sections or _laisses_ of  varying length, the lines of each _laisse_ being held together by  a single assonance.[2] And such is the form in which the best _chansons  de geste_ are written. The decasyllabic line, derived originally from  popular Latin verse, rhythmical rather than metrical, such as the  Roman legionaries sang, is the favourite verse of the older chansons.  The alexandrine,[3] first seen in the _Pelerinage de Jerusalem_ of  the early years of the twelfth century, in general indicates later  and inferior work. The _laisse_, bound in one by its identical  assonance, might contain five lines or five hundred. In chansons of  late date the full rhyme often replaces assonance; but inducing, as  it did in unskilled hands, artificial and feeble expansions of the  sense, rhyme was a cause which co-operated with other causes in the  decline of this form of narrative poetry.    [Footnote 2: _Assonance_, _i.e._ vowel-rhyme, without an agreement  of consonants.]    [Footnote 3: Verse of twelve syllables, with cesura after the sixth  accented syllable. In the decasyllabic line the cesura generally  followed the fourth, but sometimes the sixth, tonic syllable.]    Naturally the chansons which celebrated the achievements of one epic  personage or one heroic family fell into a group, and the idea of  cycles of songs having arisen, the later poets forced many independent  subjects to enter into the so-called cycle of the king (Charlemagne),  or that of William of Orange, or that of Doon of Mayence. The second  of these had, indeed, a genuine cyclic character: it told of the  resistance of the south of France to the Mussulmans. The last cycle  to develop was that of the Crusades. Certain poems or groups of poems  may be distinguished as _gestes_ of the provinces, including the  _Geste des Lorrains_, that of the North (_Raoul de Cambrai_), that  of Burgundy, and others.[4] Among these may be placed the beautiful  tale of _Amis et Amiles_, a glorification of friendship between man  and man, which endures all trials and self-sacrifices. Other poems,  again, are unconnected with any of these cycles; and, indeed, the  cyclic division is more a convenience of classification than a fact  in the spontaneous development of this form of art. The entire period  of the evolution of epic song extends from the tenth or eleventh to  the fifteenth century, or, we might say, from the _Chanson de Roland_  to the _Chronique de Bertrand Duguesclin_. The eleventh century  produced the most admirable work; in the twelfth century the chansons  are more numerous, but nothing was written of equal merit with the  Song of Roland; after the death of Louis VII. (1180) the old epic  material was rehandled and beaten thin--the decadence was already  in progress.    [Footnote 4: The epopee composed in Provencal, sung but not  transcribed, is wholly lost. The development of lyric poetry in the  South probably checked the development of the epic.]    The style in which the _chansons de geste_ are written is something  traditional, something common to the people and to the time, rather  than characteristic of the individual authors. They show little of  the art of arranging or composing the matter so as to produce an unity  of effect: the narrative straggles or condenses itself as if by  accident; skill in transitions is unknown. The study of character  is rude and elementary: a man is either heroic or dastard, loyal or  a traitor; wholly noble, or absolutely base. Yet certain types of  manhood and womanhood are presented with power and beauty. The feeling  for external nature, save in some traditional formulae, hardly  appears. The passion for the marvellous is everywhere present: St.  Maurice, St. George, and a shining company, mounted on white steeds,  will of a sudden bear down the hordes of the infidel; an angel stands  glorious behind the throne of Charlemagne; or in narrative of Celtic  origin angels may be mingled with fays. God, the great suzerain, to  whom even kings owe homage, rules over all; Jesus and Mary are watchful  of the soldiers of the cross; Paradise receives the souls of the  faithful. As for earth, there is no land so gay or so dear as _la  douce France_. The Emperor is above all the servant and protector  of the Church. As the influence of the great feudal lords increased,  they are magnified often at the expense of the monarchy; yet even  when in high rebellion, they secretly feel the duty of loyalty. The  recurring poetic epithet and phrase of formula found in the _chansons  de geste_ often indicate rather than veil a defect of imagination.  Episodes and adventures are endlessly repeated from poem to poem with  varying circumstances--the siege, the assault, the capture, the duel  of Christian hero and Saracen giant, the Paynim princess amorous of  a fair French prisoner, the marriage, the massacre, and a score of  other favourite incidents.    The popularity of the French epopee extended beyond France. Every  country of Europe translated or imitated the _chansons de geste_.  Germany made the fortunate choice of _Roland_ and _Aliscans_. In  England two of the worst examples, _Fierabras_ and _Otinel_, were  special favourites. In Norway the chansons were applied to the purpose  of religious propaganda. Italy made the tales of Roland, Ogier, Renaud,  her own. Meanwhile the national epopee declined in France; a breath  of scepticism touched and withered the leafage and blossom of  imagination; it even became possible to parody--as in _Audigier_--the  heroic manner. The employment of rhyme in place of assonance, and of  the alexandrine in place of the decasyllabic line, encouraged what may  be called poetical padding. The influence of the Breton romances  diverted the _chansons de geste_ into ways of fantasy; \"We shall never  know,\" writes M. Leon Gautier, \"the harm which the Round Table has  done us.\" Finally, verse became a weariness, and was replaced by  prose. The decline had progressed to a fall.      III  THE EPIC OF ANTIQUITY    Later to develop than the national epopee was that which formed the  cycle of antiquity. Their romantic matter made the works of the  Greco-Roman decadence even more attractive than the writings of the  great classical authors to poets who would enter into rivalry with  the singers of the _chansons de geste_. These poems, which  mediaevalise ancient literature--poems often of portentous  length--have been classified in three groups--epic romances,  historical or pseudo-historical romances, and mythological tales,  including the imitations of Ovid. The earliest in date of the first  group (about 1150-1155) is the ROMANCE OF THEBES, the work of an  unknown author, founded upon a compendium of the Thebaid of Statius,  preceded by the story of OEdipus. It opened the way for the vast  ROMANCE OF TROY, written some ten years later, by Benoit de  Sainte-More. The chief sources of Benoit were versions, probably more  or less augmented, of the famous records of the Trojan war, ascribed  to the Phrygian Dares, an imaginary defender of the city, and the  Cretan Dictys, one of the besiegers. Episodes were added, in which,  on a slender suggestion, Benoit set his own inventive faculty to work,  and among these by far the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#3)"],[1,"deprived of their  natural support and protection. If these weaker members of society,  not yet able to support and protect themselves, were not provided for,  they would perish and become thus lost to the race. From the time of  primeval man to the present, these weaker individuals of society who  have been deprived of their natural protectors, have been cared for by  the stronger members of society and afforded such support and  protection as they may need to make them independent. In a similar way  the sick and defective members of society are cared for by the strong.  Thus we see that the building and maintenance of orphanages,  hospitals, asylums and \"homes,\" are activities that belong clearly to  the group of phyletic or altruistic activities.      2. SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY.    Sacrifice and Compensation in Egoistic Activities.    The thoughtful student is very likely to ask--Why does man till the  fields? Why does man fell the forest trees? Why does he cultivate  domestic animals? Why does he delve in the earth for minerals? These  are all strenuous activities that require the outlay of time, talent  and strength. We may say that they are sacrifices that he makes and,  apparently, willingly. We have only to study the problem more closely  to see that he tills the fields and cultivates his domestic animals  for food; that he fells the forest trees to make for himself shelter;  that he cultivates certain plants and animals to procure for himself  clothing; that he delves in the earth to bring out mineral products to  use in the various industries that supply various elements of his  livelihood. It becomes manifest then that the egoistic activities of  an organism represent sacrifice followed by compensation. The  individual sacrifices in order that he may reap his reward or receive  his compensation. It may be stated as a general biological truth that,  _nature demands sacrifice or work on the part of all living organisms;  and, under normal conditions, metes out a compensation commensurate  with the sacrifice made_.      Sacrifice and Compensation in the Phyletic Activities.    a. =Lower Organisms.=--As an example of a lower organism we may take  the _amoeba_. If one watches an amoeba under the microscope he may see  it move about the field, creeping along the surface of the glass  plate; throwing out a pseudopodium here; invaginating a mouth or  stomach there; taking in and digesting minute plant organisms;  transporting itself across the field of the microscope through the aid  of improvised locomotory organs. All these activities are egoistic.  The amoeba is putting forth effort to gain its sustenance; it is  sacrificing energy to receive compensation in the form of support. If  we continue to watch this minute organism we will find that sooner or  later it goes into a resting stage which does not last long before we  can observe important internal changes making themselves manifest  first at the nucleus, which slowly divides into two equal portions  that separate, each carrying with it about half of the protoplasm of  the parent organism. As these two young amoebae lie side by side under  the microscope the thoughtful student will inquire--what has become of  the parent organism? Whereas at first there was one mature amoeba, now  we have before us two young amoebae of the next succeeding generation.  The parent organism has sacrificed its substance and its individuality  absolutely and completely for the next generation.        [Illustration: Plate I Reproduction in the Amoeba.]    It may be said in general that _reproduction always involves a  division of the parent organism_. In the case of the amoeba the  division is into two equal portions. In the case of some of the lower  plants and animals the substance of the parent organism is divided  into many equal minute spores or eggs, each of which develops a new  organism.    b. =Higher Organisms.=--These also suffer a division of their body  protoplasm. However, instead of dividing into two or more equal parts  and merging their individuality immediately into the next generation,  the higher organisms divide off a very small portion of their  protoplasm to make an egg or seed while the parent organism lives on  to produce eggs or seeds on subsequent occasions.    While the parental sacrifice in eggs or spermatozoa is minute and  inconsiderable in the higher animals, the sacrifices subsequent to  this initial division are incalculably greater in higher animals than  in the lower organisms. We can cite no better example than the human  subject. The human ovum, divided off from the maternal organism, is a  minute globule of protoplasm, almost microscopic in size. The  sacrifice of the mother in producing the ovum is inconsiderable, but  the production of the ovum is simply the first step in the sacrifice  which the maternal organism makes.    The fertilized ovum makes a lodgment on the inner surface of the  uterus or womb and begins immediately to absorb its nourishment from  the maternal organism. It soon develops a heart and blood vessels so  related to the blood vessels of the mother that throughout its  intra-uterine existence the mother's blood supplies the growing child  all of the substance that is built up into bone, muscle, brain and  glands, preparing the young child to come into the world a living,  breathing, sentient organism. These draughts upon the vitality of the  maternal organism are so great that they frequently result in a very  sensible depletion of the mother's physical power, particularly  manifest in the depletion of the blood.    During the period when the young child is developing within the body  of the mother, she must make other sacrifices, viz., the withdrawal  from society more closely within the four walls of her home where she  busies herself many days in preparation of the wardrobe for the  expected child. Then there are sacrifices incident to childbirth  represented especially in the pain and travail of parturition. During  the first year of the child's life in normal cases, it draws its  nourishment from its mother's breast. This nourishment in turn is  elaborated by the milk-secreting glands from the mother's blood--still  further depleting her system. During its childhood and youth the  mother prepares the food, clothing and shelter of her child at no  small expense of her own time and strength. For years the mother holds  herself ready to watch by the bedside of her child should he fall  sick, and there is hardly a mother in the land who has not spent many  nights in this vigil by the bed of her sick child.    We might turn now briefly to the consideration of the sacrifices that  the father makes.    As is the case with mother so with the father, the initial sacrifice  in the division of a portion of his body is too small to be  considered, but in his case as in the case of the mother, the  sacrifice for the coming progeny is only initiated with the act of  procreation and continues through a period of fifteen, twenty or even  thirty years--sometimes progressively increasing to the last. These  sacrifices take the form, for the most part, of support and  protection, and begin soon after conception on the part of the  mother--as the pregnant woman usually requires much greater solicitude  and care on the part of the husband than she does on other occasions.    The normal father, like the normal mother, holds himself in readiness  to watch by the bedside of the sick child should the occasion arise,  and to make other sacrifices incident to the protection and support of  the child.    It is shown above that sacrifices incident to the egoistic activities  receive their compensation. The question next demanding our attention  is--do the sacrifices which are made incident to our phyletic  activities receive a compensation? The most striking solution of this  question would be a personal solution. Let any young man ask his  parents if they have been compensated for all the sacrifices they  have made for him. If this son is such a one as brings pride and  satisfaction to the parents it is very evident what their unhesitating  answer would be, viz., that they have been compensated many times over  for all the sacrifices they have made. In what does such compensation  consist? It can be expressed most briefly: LOVE OF OFFSPRING. This  principle of _love of offspring_ seems to be a more or less general  one in the whole realm of conscious living nature. That a tree could  possess this no one would suggest; that a sea urchin could possess it  no one would be likely to contend. It is probably possessed by all of  those animals that are conscious of sacrifices; that is, if an animal  is conscious of sacrifice he is capable of being conscious of this  compensation which we term, _love of offspring_. For organisms too low  in the scale of life to be conscious of either sacrifice or love of  offspring, nature seems to have arranged another scale of sacrifices  and compensations--sacrifice taking the form of contention for  possession of females and sacrifice in their support and protection,  the recompense being the gratification incident to sexual intercourse.    That this last factor may enter, to a certain extent, as a determining  factor among the higher animals cannot be questioned. The higher we  get in the scale of animal life the less the part played by _sexual  gratification_ and the greater the part played by _love of offspring_.  In some of the higher animals, especially those in which the family  circle is maintained or the community life highly developed, there is  frequently at work still another consideration that may play no small  part in ameliorating or compensating the sacrifice incident to  reproduction. Reference is here made to the expectation on the part of  the parents that support and protection will be provided for them in  their old age when they are unable to support or protect"]]]
