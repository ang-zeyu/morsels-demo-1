The boundless curiosity of the Renaissance led back inevitably  to an interest in life and to an acceptance of things for what they  were,--for their intrinsic quality. The moment people stopped looking  fixedly toward heaven their eyes fell upon the earth, and they began to  see much on its surface that was pleasant. Their own faces and figures  must have struck them as surprisingly interesting, and, considering how  little St. Bernard and other mediaeval saints and doctors had led them to  expect, singularly beautiful. A new feeling arose that mere living was a  big part of life, and with it came a new passion, the passion for  beauty, for grace, and for comeliness.    It has already been suggested that the Renaissance was a period in the  history of modern Europe comparable to youth in the life of the  individual. It had all youth's love of finery and of play. The more  people were imbued with the new spirit, the more they loved pageants.  The pageant was an outlet for many of the dominant passions of the  time, for there a man could display all the finery he pleased, satisfy  his love of antiquity by masquerading as Caesar or Hannibal, his love of  knowledge by finding out how the Romans dressed and rode in triumph, his  love of glory by the display of wealth and skill in the management of  the ceremony, and, above all, his love of feeling himself alive. Solemn  writers have not disdained to describe to the minutest details many of  the pageants which they witnessed.    We have seen that the earlier elements of the Renaissance, the passion  for knowledge and glory, were not of the kind to give a new impulse to  painting. Nor was the passion for antiquity at all so direct an  inspiration to that art as it was to architecture and sculpture. The  love of glory had, it is true, led such as could not afford to put up  monumental buildings, to decorate chapels with frescoes in which their  portraits were timidly introduced. But it was only when the Renaissance  had attained to a full consciousness of its interest in life and  enjoyment of the world that it naturally turned, and indeed was forced  to turn, to painting; for it is obvious that painting is peculiarly  fitted for rendering the appearances of things with a glow of light and  richness of colour that correspond to and express warm human emotions.    =IV. Painting and the Renaissance.=--When it once reached the point  where its view of the world naturally sought expression in painting, as  religious ideas had done before, the Renaissance found in Venice clearer  utterance than elsewhere, and it is perhaps this fact which makes the  most abiding interest of Venetian painting. It is at this point that we  shall take it up.    The growing delight in life with the consequent love of health, beauty,  and joy were felt more powerfully in Venice than anywhere else in Italy.  The explanation of this may be found in the character of the Venetian  government which was such that it gave little room for the satisfaction  of the passion for personal glory, and kept its citizens so busy in  duties of state that they had small leisure for learning. Some of the  chief passions of the Renaissance thus finding no outlet in Venice, the  other passions insisted all the more on being satisfied. Venice,  moreover, was the only state in Italy which was enjoying, and for many  generations had been enjoying, internal peace. This gave the Venetians a  love of comfort, of ease, and of splendour, a refinement of manner, and  humaneness of feeling, which made them the first really modern people in  Europe. Since there was little room for personal glory in Venice, the  perpetuators of glory, the Humanists, found at first scant encouragement  there, and the Venetians were saved from that absorption in archaeology  and pure science which overwhelmed Florence at an early date. This was  not necessarily an advantage in itself, but it happened to suit Venice,  where the conditions of life had for some time been such as to build up  a love of beautiful things. As it was, the feeling for beauty was not  hindered in its natural development. Archaeology would have tried to  submit it to the good taste of the past, a proceeding which rarely  promotes good taste in the present. Too much archaeology and too much  science might have ended in making Venetian art academic, instead of  letting it become what it did, the product of a natural ripening of  interest in life and love of pleasure. In Florence, it is true, painting  had developed almost simultaneously with the other arts, and it may be  due to this very cause that the Florentine painters never quite realised  what a different task from the architect's and sculptor's was theirs. At  the time, therefore, when the Renaissance was beginning to find its best  expression in painting, the Florentines were already too much attached  to classical ideals of form and composition, in other words, too  academic, to give embodiment to the throbbing feeling for life and  pleasure.    Thus it came to pass that in the Venetian pictures of the end of the  fifteenth century we find neither the contrition nor the devotion of  those earlier years when the Church alone employed painting as the  interpreter of emotion, nor the learning which characterised the  Florentines. The Venetian masters of this time, although nominally  continuing to paint the Madonna and saints, were in reality painting  handsome, healthy, sane people like themselves, people who wore their  splendid robes with dignity, who found life worth the mere living and  sought no metaphysical basis for it. In short, the Venetian pictures of  the last decade of the century seemed intended not for devotion, as they  had been, nor for admiration, as they then were in Florence, but for  enjoyment.    The Church itself, as has been said, had educated its children to  understand painting as a language. Now that the passions men dared to  avow were no longer connected with happiness in some future state only,  but mainly with life in the present, painting was expected to give voice  to these more human aspirations and to desert the outgrown ideals of the  Church. In Florence, the painters seemed unable or unwilling to make  their art really popular. Nor was it so necessary there, for Poliziano,  Pulci, and Lorenzo dei Medici supplied the need of self-expression by  addressing the Florentines in the language which their early enthusiasm  for antiquity and their natural gifts had made them understand better  than any other--the language of poetry. In Venice alone painting  remained what it had been all over Italy in earlier times, the common  tongue of the whole mass of the people. Venetian artists thus had the  strongest inducements to perfect the processes which painters must  employ to make pictures look real to their own generation; and their  generation had an altogether firmer hold on reality than any that had  been known since the triumph of Christianity. Here again the comparison  of the Renaissance to youth must be borne in mind. The grasp that youth  has on reality is not to be compared to that brought by age, and we must  not expect to find in the Renaissance a passion for an acquaintance with  things as they are such as we ourselves have; but still its grasp of  facts was far firmer than that of the Middle Ages.    Painting, in accommodating itself to the new ideas, found that it could  not attain to satisfactory representation merely by form and colour, but  that it required light and shadow and effects of space. Indeed, venial  faults of drawing are perhaps the least disturbing, while faults of  perspective, of spacing, and of colour completely spoil a picture for  people who have an every-day acquaintance with painting such as the  Venetians had. We find the Venetian painters, therefore, more and more  intent upon giving the space they paint its real depth, upon giving  solid objects the full effect of the round, upon keeping the different  parts of a figure within the same plane, and upon compelling things to  hold their proper places one behind the other. As early as the beginning  of the sixteenth century a few of the greater Venetian painters had  succeeded in making distant objects less and less distinct, as well as  smaller and smaller, and had succeeded also in giving some appearance of  reality to the atmosphere. These are a few of the special problems of  painting, as distinct from sculpture for instance, and they are problems  which, among the Italians, only the Venetians and the painters closely  connected with them solved with any success.      =V. Pageant Pictures.=--The painters of the end of the fifteenth century  who met with the greatest success in solving these problems were  Giovanni and Gentile Bellini, Cima da Conegliano, and Carpaccio, and we  find each of them enjoyable to the degree that he was in touch with the  life of his day. I have already spoken of pageants and of how  characteristic they were of the Renaissance, forming as they did a sort  of safety-valve for its chief passions. Venice, too, knew the love of  glory, and the passion was perhaps only the more intense because it was  all dedicated to the State. There was nothing the Venetians would not do  to add to its greatness, glory, and splendour. It was this which led  them to make of the city itself that wondrous monument to the love and  awe they felt for their Republic, which still rouses more admiration and  gives more pleasure than any other one achievement of the art-impulse in  man. They were not content to make their city the most beautiful in the  world; they performed ceremonies in its honour partaking of all the  solemnity of religious rites. Processions and pageants by land and by  sea, free from that gross element of improvisation which characterised  them elsewhere in Italy, formed no "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22131"],[0,"The Story of the Upper Canadian Rebellion, Volume 1 (#3)"],[1," a man, no matter what his crimes, should have his  nervous system thus cruelly undermined; that his physical and mental  faculties should be slowly but surely filched from him in this  deliberate fashion, is an idea not to be borne with composure by anyone  whose breast is susceptible to human impulses. But Robert Gourlay was no  great criminal. He had engaged in no plot to blow up King, Lords and  Commons. He had been guilty of no treason or felony. He had threatened  no man's life, and taken no man's purse upon the highway. He was by no  means the stuff of which great criminals are made. He was not even a  vicious or immoral man. He was an affectionate husband, a fond and  indulgent father. His story, from beginning to end, even when subjected  to the fiercest light that can be thrown upon it, discloses nothing  cruel or revengeful, nothing vile or outrageously wicked, nothing  grovelling or base, nothing sordid or mean. On the other hand, it  discloses a man of many noble and generous impulses; a man with a great  heart in his bosom which could warmly sympathize with the wrongs of his  fellow-creatures; a man in whom was no selfishness or greed; a man of  decided principles and stainless morals; who was incapable of dishonesty  or cruelty; who had a high sense of human responsibility; who feared his  God and honoured his King. When we compare his virtuous and honourable,  albeit turbulent and much misguided life, with that of any one of his  immediate persecutors, the contrast is mournfully suggestive of Mr.  Lowell's antithesis about        \"Truth forever on the scaffold; wrong forever on the throne.\"    To what, then, was his long and bitter persecution to be attributed? Why  had he been deprived of his liberty; thrust into a dark and unwholesome  dungeon; refused the benefit of the Habeas Corpus Act; denied his  enlargement upon bail or main-prize; branded as a malefactor of the most  dangerous kind; badgered and tortured to the ruin of his health and his  reason? Merely this: he had imbibed, in advance, the spirit of Mr.  Arthur Clennam, and had \"wanted to know.\"[2] He had displayed a  persistent determination to let in the light of day upon the iniquities  and rascalities of public officials. He had denounced the system of  patronage and favouritism in the disposal of the Crown Lands. He had  inveighed against some of the human bloodsuckers of that day, in  language which certainly was not gracious or parliamentary, but which as  certainly was both forcible and true. He had even ventured to speak in  contumelious terms of the reverend Rector of York himself, whom he had  stigmatized as \"a lying little fool of a renegade Presbyterian.\" Nay, he  had advised the sending of commissioners to England to entreat Imperial  attention to colonial grievances. He had been the one man in Upper  Canada possessed of sufficient courage to do and to dare: to lift the  thin and flimsy veil which only half concealed the corruption whereby a  score of greedy vampires were rapidly enriching themselves at the public  cost. He had dared to hold up to general inspection the baneful effects  of an irresponsible Executive, and of a dominating clique whose one hope  lay in preserving the existing order of things undisturbed. It was for  this that the Inquisition had wreaked its vengeance upon him; for this  that the vials of Executive wrath had been poured upon his head; for  this that his body had been subjugated and his nerves lacerated by more  than seven months' close imprisonment; for this that he had been \"ruined  in his fortune and overwhelmed in his mind.\" And all these things took  place in \"this Canada of ours,\" in the year of grace eighteen hundred  and nineteen--barely sixty-six years ago--while the Duke of Richmond was  Governor-General, and his handsome scapegrace of a son-in-law nominally  administered the government of the Upper Province.    With a view to a clearer understanding of the circumstances which led to  this most villainous of Canadian State prosecutions, it will be well to  glance at some details of the prisoner's past life.[3]    Robert Gourlay was the son of a gentleman of considerable fortune--a  retired Writer to the Signet--and was born in the parish of Ceres,  Fifeshire, Scotland, in 1778. He received an education suitable to his  social position, and while at the University of St. Andrews was the  fellow-student and personal friend of young Thomas Chalmers, who  afterwards became one of the most eloquent pulpit orators of modern  times.[4] Robert was the eldest son of his parents, and, being heir to  the paternal estates, he grew up to manhood with the expectation of one  day succeeding to wealth and station in society. He was put to no  profession, and after leaving college, devoted himself to no settled  pursuit. He was on visiting terms with the resident gentry of his native  shire, and took some interest in local military matters. In 1806 he  offered to take charge of an expedition for the invasion of Paris, being  probably impelled thereto by the mad attempt of Lord Camelford several  years before. He was full of energy and robust health, bountiful and  generous to the poor of the parish, a practical philanthropist,  possessed of great intelligence and a genuine love for his kind; but  withal somewhat flighty and erratic, of impetuous temper, deficient in  tact and discretion, and given to revery and theorizing. He was, in  short, a bundle of contradictions, some of his idiosyncrasies being  doubtless inherited from his father, who was a generous and high-minded  but unpractical man. The sire would seem to have been conscious of his  son's weaknesses. \"Robert,\" he was wont to say, \"will hurt himself, but  do good to others.\" The son studied deeply the economical side of the  pauper question, and his researches in this direction brought him into  intimate relations with that eminent writer Mr. Arthur Young,[5] at  whose suggestion he was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the  condition of the poor in England. By virtue of this appointment he  travelled, chiefly on foot, through the most important agricultural  districts of the island, after which he was pronounced by competent  authorities to be the best-informed man in the kingdom respecting the  poor of Great Britain. As I have said elsewhere: \"He was consulted by  members of Parliament, political economists, parish overseers, and even  by members of the Cabinet, as to the best means for reforming the poor  laws, and was always ready to spend himself and his substance for the  public good.\"[6]    Having married and settled down on one of his father's estates, he took  upon himself various offices of public usefulness and philanthropy. His  enterprise and public spirit caused him to be much looked up to by the  yeomanry of Fifeshire, and he soon came to be recognized as the special  champion of the smaller tenantry at agricultural meetings. At one of  these meetings he conceived himself to have been discourteously treated  by his neighbour, the Earl of Kellie. The discourtesy does not seem to  have been of a serious nature, but Mr. Gourlay became irritated to a  degree altogether disproportionate to the offence. He wrote and  published a pamphlet, in which Lord Kellie was handled with much  severity. It was circulated by the author throughout Fifeshire, and  widely read; and from this time forward he was much given to taking the  public into his confidence respecting his personal grievances. His  attack on Lord Kellie, however, weakened his popularity, and in 1809,  partly owing to this cause, and partly to his being in temporary  ill-health, he accepted a proposal from the Duke of Somerset to become  the tenant of a farm belonging to his Grace, and situated in the parish  of Wily, in Wiltshire. For a time all went well with him in his new  abode. His farm was a model for the emulation of all the landholders in  the parish, and his products gained prize after prize at successive  agricultural exhibitions. But Mr. Gourlay was nothing if not critical,  and certain of his surroundings afforded legitimate grounds for  fault-finding. There were many and serious defects in the system of  administering the poor-laws of Great Britain in those days, and the  administration in the parish of Wily was attended by some specially  objectionable features. These erelong became painfully apparent to the  keen eyes of Mr. Gourlay, who began to agitate for a reform. He went  into the matter with characteristic earnestness, and, by dint of  constant speechifying and weekly letters addressed to the local  newspapers, he soon began to produce an impression. His appetite for  agitation grew by what it fed upon, insomuch that he became a confirmed  grievance-monger and hunter-up of abuses. The magnates of the county  began to look coldly upon him, and even, in some instances, to array  themselves in open opposition to him. This only tended still further to  arouse the native pugnacity of his disposition, and his attacks upon  local abuses and those who upheld them became more and more violent.  Now, in all this there can be no doubt that Mr. Gourlay was from first  to last chiefly actuated by genuine philanthropy. He certainly had no  selfish or pecuniary purpose to serve; and indeed it is hard to conceive  of a man less influenced by mercenary motives. His life was passed in a  perpetual war against veritable and undoubted evils; but unfortunately  his hotheadedness and want of tact prevented him from doing justice to  himself and his views. He lacked the calm intellect and patient temper  necessary to the successful fighting of life's stern battle, and had the  unhappy faculty of generally putting himself in the wrong, even when  there could be no doubt that he had originally been in the right. Some  of his letters to the newspapers were remarkable for nothing but their  indiscretion, violence and bad taste, and he came to be looked upon by  the landlords "]]]
