But Lad could  follow every phase of it; the cautious skirting of each chair; the  hesitant pause as a bit of ancient furniture creaked; the halt in front  of the safe; the queer grinding noise, muffled but persevering, at the  lock; then the faint creak of the swinging iron door, and the deft  groping of fingers.    Soon, the man started back toward the pale oblong of gloom which marked  the window's outlines from the surrounding black. Lad's tail began to  wag again. Apparently, this eccentric person was coming out, after all,  to keep him company. Now, the man was kneeling on the window-seat. Now,  in gingerly fashion, he reached forward and set the small bag down on  the veranda; before negotiating the climb across the broad seat,--a  climb that might well call for the use of both his hands.    Lad was entranced. Here was a game he understood. Thus, more than once,  had the Mistress tossed out to him his flannel doll, as he had stood in  pathetic invitation on the porch, looking in at her as she read or  talked. She had laughed at his wild tossings and other maltreatments of  the limp doll. He had felt he was scoring a real hit. And this hit he  decided to repeat.    Snatching up the swollen little satchel, almost before it left the  intruder's hand, Lad shook it, joyously, reveling in the faint clink  and jingle of the contents. He backed playfully away; the bag-handle  swinging in his jaws. Crouching low, he wagged his tail in ardent  invitation to the stranger to chase him and get back the satchel. Thus  did the Master romp with Lad, when the flannel doll was the prize of  their game. And Lad loved such races.    Yes, the stranger was accepting the invitation. The moment he had  crawled out on the veranda he reached down for the bag. As it was not  where he thought he had left it, he swung his groping hand forward in a  half-circle, his fingers sweeping the floor.    Make that enticing motion, directly in front of a playful collie pup;  specially if he has something he doesn't want you to take from  him;--and watch the effect.    Instantly, Lad was athrill with the spirit of the game. In one  scurrying backward jump, he was off the veranda and on the lawn, tail  vibrating, eyes dancing; satchel held tantalizingly towards its  would-be possessor.    The light sound of his body touching ground reached the man. Reasoning  that the sweep of his own arm had somehow knocked the bag off the  porch, he ventured off the edge of the veranda and flashed a swathed  ray of his pocket light along the ground in search of it.    The flashlight's lens was cleverly muffled; in a way to give forth but  a single subdued finger of illumination. That one brief glimmer was  enough to show the thief a right impossible sight. The glow struck  answering lights from the polished sides of the brown bag. The bag was  hanging in air, some six inches above the grass and perhaps five feet  away from him. Then he saw it swig frivolously to one side and vanish  in the night.    The astonished man had seen more. Feeble was the flashlight's shrouded  ray, too feeble to outline against the night the small dark body behind  the shining brown bag. But that same ray caught and reflected back to  the incredulous beholder two splashes of pale fire;--glints from a pair  of deep-set collie-eyes.    As the bag disappeared, the eerie fire-points were gone. The thief all  but dropped his flashlight. He gaped in nervous dread; and sought  vainly to account for the witch-work he had witnessed. He had plenty of  nerve. He had plenty of experience along his chosen line of endeavor.  But, while a crook may control his nerve, he cannot make  it phlegmatic  or steady. Always, he must be conscious of holding it in check, as a  clever driver checks and steadies and keeps in subjection a plunging  horse. Let the vigilance slacken, and there is a runaway.    Now this particular marauder had long ago keyed his nerve to the chance  of interruption from some gun-brandishing householder; and to the  possible pursuit of police; and to the need of fighting or of fleeing.  But all his preparations had not taken into account this newest  emergency. He had not steeled himself to watch unmoved the gliding away  of a treasure-satchel, apparently moving of its own will; nor the  shimmer of two greenish sparks in the air just above it. And, for an  instant, the man had to battle against a craven desire to bolt.    Lad, meanwhile, was having a beautiful time. Sincerely, he appreciated  the playful grab his nocturnal friend had made in his general  direction. Lad had countered this, by frisking away for another five or  six feet, and then wheeling about to face once more his playfellow and  to await the next move in the blithe gambol. The pup could see  tolerably well, in the darkness quite well enough to play the game his  guest had devised. And of course, he had no way of knowing that the man  could not see equally well.    Shaking off his momentary terror, the thief once more pressed the  button of his flashlight; swinging the torch in a swift semicircle and  extinguishing it at once; lest the dim glow be seen by any wakeful  member of the family.    That one quick sweep revealed to his gaze the shiny brown bag a  half-dozen feet ahead of him, still swinging several inches above  ground. He flung himself forward at it; refusing to believe he also saw  that queer double glow of pale light just above. He dived for the  satchel with the speed and the accuracy of a football tackle. And that  was all the good it did him.    Perhaps there is something in nature more agile and dismayingly elusive  than a romping young collie. But that \"something\" is not a mortal man.  As the thief sprang, Lad sprang in unison with him; darting to the left  and a yard or so backward. He came to an expectant standstill once  more; his tail wildly vibrating, his entire furry body tingling with  the glad excitement of the game. This sportive visitor of his was a  veritable godsend. If only he could be coaxed into coming to play with  him every night--!    But presently he noted that the other seemed to have wearied of the  game. After plunging through the air and landing on all fours with his  grasping hands closing on nothingness, the man had remained thus, as if  dazed, for a second or so. Then he had felt the ground all about him.  Then, bewildered, he had scrambled to his feet. Now he was standing,  moveless, his lips working.    Yes, he seemed to be tired of the lovely game;--and just when Laddie  was beginning to enter into the full spirit of it. Once in a while, the  Mistress or the Master stopped playing, during the romps with the  flannel doll. And Laddie had long since hit on a trick for reviving  their interest. He employed this ruse now.    As the man stood, puzzled and scared, something brushed very  lightly,-even coquettishly,--against his knuckles. He started in  nervous fright. An instant later, the same thing brushed his knuckles  again, this time more insistently. The man, in a spurt of fear-driven  rage, grabbed at the invisible object. His fingers slipped along the  smooth sides of the bewitched bag that Lad was shoving invitingly at  him.    Brief as was the contact, it was long enough for the thief's sensitive  finger tips to recognize what they touched. And both hands were brought  suddenly into play, in a mad snatch for the prize. The ten avid fingers  missed the bag; and came together with clawing force. But, before they  met, the finger tips of the left hand telegraphed to the man's brain  that they had had momentary light experience with something hairy and  warm,--something that had slipped, eel-like, past them into the  night;--something that most assuredly was no satchel, but ALIVE!    The man's throat contracted, in gagging fright. And, as before, fear  scourged him to feverish rage.    Recklessly he pressed the flashlight's button; and swung the muffled  bar of light in every direction. In his other hand he leveled the  pistol he had drawn. This time the shaded ray revealed to him not only  his bag, but,--vaguely,--the Thing that held it.    He could not make out what manner of creature it was which gripped the  satchel's handle and whose eyes pulsed back greenish flares into the  torch's dim glow. But it was an animal of some kind;--distorted and  formless in the wavering finger of blunted light; but still an animal.  Not a ghost.    And fear departed. The intruder feared nothing mortal. The mystery in  part explained, he did not bother to puzzle out the remainder of it.  Impossible as it seemed, his bag was carried by some living thing. All  that remained for him was to capture the thing, and recover his bag.  The weak light still turned on, he gave chase.    Lad's spirits arose with a bound. His ruse had succeeded. He had  reawakened in this easily-discouraged chum a new interest in the game.  And he gamboled across the lawn, fairly wriggling with delight. He did  not wish to make his friend lose interest again. So instead of dashing  off at full speed, he frisked daintily, just out of reach of the  clawing hand.    And in this pleasant fashion the two playfellows covered a hundred  yards of ground. More than once, the man came within an inch of his  quarry. But always, by the most imperceptible spurt of speed, Laddie  arranged to keep himself and his dear satchel from capture.    Then, in no time at all, the game ended; and with it ended Lad's baby  faith in the friendliness and trustworthiness of all human nature.    Realizing that the sound of his own stumblingly running feet and the  intermittent flashes of his torch might well awaken some light sleeper  in the house, the thief resolved on a daring move. This creature in  front of him,--dog or bear or goat, or whatever it was,--was  uncatchable. But by sending a bullet through it, he could bring the  animal to a sudden and permanent stop.    Then,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23920"],[0,"A Matter of Proportion (#3)"],[1," consternation, then, when he woke on D-day to find his windows plastered  with snow under a driving wind--not mentioned in last night's forecast  of course.    He could concoct a plausible excuse for postponement--which Filipson was  just the man to see through; or call help to get him to HQ--and have  Filipson bark, \"Man, you can't even make it across town on your own  power because of a little snow.\" No, come hell or blizzard, he'd have to  go solo. Besides, when he faced the inevitable unexpected behind Invader  lines, he couldn't afford a precedent of having flinched now.    He dressed and breakfasted with all the petty foresights that can mean  the shaving of clearance in a tight squeeze, and got off with all the  margin of time he could muster. In the apartment court, he had a parking  space by the basement exit and, for a wonder, no free-wheeling  nincompoop had done him out of it last night. Even so, getting to the  car door illustrated the ordeal ahead; the snow was the damp, heavy  stuff that packs and glares. The streets were nasty, but he had the  advantage of having learned restraint and foresight.    HQ had been the post office, a ponderous red-stone building filling a  whole block. He had scouted it thoroughly in advance, outside and in,  and scheduled his route to the general's office, allowing for minor  hazards. Now, he had half an hour extra for the unscheduled major  hazard.    But on arriving, he could hardly believe his luck. No car was yet parked  in front of the building, and the walk was scraped clean and salted to  kill the still falling flakes. No problems. He parked and began to  unload himself quickly, to forestall the elderly MP who hurried towards  him. But, as Scott prepared to thank him off, the man said, \"Sorry, Mac,  no one can park there this morning.\"    Scott felt the chill of nemesis. Knowing it was useless, he protested  his identity and mission.    But, \"Sorry, major. But you'll have to park around back. They're  bringing in the big computer. General himself can't park here. Them's  orders.\"    He could ask the sergeant to park the car. But the man couldn't leave  his post, would make a to-do calling someone--and that was Filipson's  suite overlooking the scene. No dice. Go see what might be possible.    But side and back parking were jammed with refugees from the computer,  and so was the other side. And he came around to the front again. Five  minutes wasted. He thought searchingly.    He could drive to a taxi lot, park there, and be driven back by taxi,  disembark on the clean walk, and there you were. Of course, he could  hear Filipson's \"Thought you drove your own car, ha?\" and his own  damaging excuses. But even Out Yonder, you'd cut corners in emergency.  It was all such a comfortable Out, he relaxed. And, relaxing, saw his  alternative.           *       *       *       *       *    He was driving around the block again, and noted the back entrance. This  was not ground level, because of the slope of ground; it faced a broad  landing, reached by a double flight of steps. These began on each side  at right-angles to the building and then turned up to the landing along  the face of the wall. Normally, they were negotiable; but now, even had  he found parking near them, he hadn't the chance of the celluloid cat in  hell of even crossing the ten feet of uncleaned sidewalk. You might as  well climb an eighty-degree, fifty-foot wall of rotten ice. But there  was always a way, and he saw it.    The unpassable walk itself was an avenue of approach. He swung his car  onto it at the corner, and drove along it to the steps to park in the  angle between steps and wall--and discovered a new shut-out. He'd  expected the steps to be a mean job in the raw wind that favored this  face of the building; but a wartime janitor had swept them sketchily  only down the middle, far from the balustrades he must use. By the  balustrades, early feet had packed a semi-ice far more treacherous than  the untouched snow; and, the two bottom steps curved out beyond the  balustrade. So ... a sufficiently reckless alpinist might assay a cliff  in a sleet storm and gale, but he couldn't even try if it began with an  overhang.    Still time for the taxi. And so, again Scott saw the way that was always  there: Set the car so he could use its hood to heft up those first  steps.    Suddenly, his thinking metamorphosed: He faced, not a miserable,  unwarranted forlorn hope, but the universe as it was. Titanic pressure  suit against the hurricanes of Jupiter, and against a gutter freshet,  life was always outclassed--and always fought back. Proportions didn't  matter, only mood.    He switched on his ICEG to record what might happen. I auditioned it,  but I can't disentangle it from what he told me. For example, in his  words: Multiply distances by five, heights by ten, and slickness by  twenty. And in the playback: Thirty chin-high ledges loaded with soft  lard, and only finger holds and toe holds. And you did it on stilts that  began, not at your heels, at your hips. Add the hazard of Helpful Hosea:  \"Here, lemme giveya hand, Mac!\", grabbing the key arm, and crashing down  the precipice on top of you.    Switching on the ICEG took his mind back to the snug apartment where its  receiver stood, the armchair, books, desk of diverting work. It looked  awful good, but ... life fought back, and always it found a way.           *       *       *       *       *    He shucked his windbreaker because it would be more encumbrance than  help in the showdown. He checked, shoelaces, and strapped on the cleats  he had made for what they were worth. He vetoed the bag of sand and salt  he kept for minor difficulties--far too slow. He got out of the car.    This could be the last job he'd have to do incognito--Seed-corn, he'd  get credit for. Therefore, he cherished it: triumph for its own sake.  Alternatively, he'd end at the bottom in a burlesque clutter of  chrom-alum splints and sticks, with maybe a broken bone to clinch the  decision. For some men, death is literally more tolerable than defeat in  humiliation.    Eighteen shallow steps to the turn, twelve to the top. Once, he'd have  cleared it in three heartbeats. Now, he had to make it to a  twenty-minute deadline, without rope or alpenstock, a Moon-man adapted  to a fraction of Earth gravity.    With the help of the car hood, the first two pitches were easy. For the  next four or five, wind had swept the top of the balustrade, providing  damp, gritty handhold. Before the going got tougher, he developed a  technic, a rhythm and system of thrusts proportioned to heights and  widths, a way of scraping holds where ice was not malignantly welded to  stone, an appreciation of snow texture and depth, an economy of effort.    He was enjoying a premature elation when, on the twelfth step, a cleat  strap gave. Luckily, he was able to take his lurch with a firm grip on  the balustrade; but he felt depth yawning behind him. Dourly, he took  thirty seconds to retrieve the cleat; stitching had been sawed through  by a metal edge--just as he'd told the cocksure workman it would be. Oh,  to have a world where imbecility wasn't entrenched! Well--he was  fighting here and now for the resources to found one. He resumed the  escalade, his rhythm knocked cockeyed.    Things even out. Years back, an Invader bomber had scored a near miss on  the building, and minor damage to stonework was unrepaired. Crevices  gave fingerhold, chipped-out hollows gave barely perceptible purchase to  the heel of his hand. Salutes to the random effects of unlikely causes!    He reached the turn, considered swiftly. His fresh strength was blunted;  his muscles, especially in his thumbs, were stiffening with chill. Now:  He could continue up the left side, by the building, which was tougher  and hazardous with frozen drippings, or by the outside, right-hand rail,  which was easier but meant crossing the open, half-swept wide step and  recrossing the landing up top. Damn! Why hadn't he foreseen that? Oh,  you can't think of everything. Get going, left side.           *       *       *       *       *    The wall of the building was rough-hewn and ornamented with surplus  carvings. Cheers for the 1890s architect!    Qualified cheers. The first three lifts were easy, with handholds in a  frieze of lotus. For the next, he had to heft with his side-jaw against  a boss of stone. A window ledge made the next three facile. The final  five stared, an open gap without recourse. He made two by grace of the  janitor's having swabbed his broom a little closer to the wall. His  muscles began to wobble and waver: in his proportions, he'd made  two-hundred feet of almost vertical ascent.    But, climbing a real ice-fall, you'd unleash the last convulsive effort  because you had to. Here, when you came down to it, you could always sit  and bump yourself down to the car which was, in that context, a mere  safe forty feet away. So he went on because he had to.    He got the rubber tip off one stick. The bare metal tube would bore into  the snow pack. It might hold, _if_ he bore down just right, and swung  his weight just so, and got just the right sliding purchase on the wall,  and the snow didn't give underfoot or undercane. And if it didn't  work--it didn't work.    Beyond the landing, westwards, the sky had broken into April blue, far  away over Iowa and Kansas, over Operation Seed-corn, over the refuge for  rebels that lay at the end of all his roads....    He got set ... and lifted. A thousand miles nearer the refuge! Got set  ... and lifted, balanced over plunging gulfs. His reach found a round  pilaster at the top, a perfect grip for a hand. He drew himself up, and  this time his cleated foot cut through snow to stone, and slipped, but  his hold was too good. And there he was.    No salutes, no cheers, only one more victory for life.    Even in victory, unlife gave you no respite. The doorstep was three feet"]]]
