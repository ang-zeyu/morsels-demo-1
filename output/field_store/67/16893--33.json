The first traveller of whom we have any account in history, is Hanno,  who was sent by the Carthaginian senate to colonize some parts of  the Western coast of Africa. The account of this expedition was  written in the Carthaginian language and afterwards translated into  Greek. It is known to us now by the name of the \"Periplus of Hanno.\"  At what period this explorer lived, historians are not agreed, but  the most probable account assigns the date B.C. 505 to his  exploration of the African coast.    Hanno left Carthage with a fleet of sixty vessels of fifty oars each,  carrying 30,000 persons, and provisions for a long voyage. These  emigrants, for so we may call them, were destined to people the new  towns that the Carthaginians hoped to found on the west coast of  Libya, or as we now call it, Africa.    The fleet successfully passed the Pillars of Hercules, the rocks of  Gibraltar and Ceuta which command the Strait, and ventured on the  Atlantic, taking a southerly course. Two days after passing the  Straits, Hanno anchored on the coast, and laid the foundation of the  town of Thumiaterion.    Then he put to sea again, and doubling the cape of Solois, made  fresh discoveries, and advanced to the mouth of a large African  river, where he found a tribe of wandering shepherds camping on the  banks. He only waited to conclude a treaty of alliance with them,  before continuing his voyage southward. He next reached the Island  of Cerne, situated in a bay, and measuring five stadia in  circumference, or as we should say at the present day, nearly 925  yards. According to Hanno's own account, this island should be  placed, with regard to the Pillars of Hercules, at an equal distance  to that which separates these Pillars from Carthage.    They set sail again, and Hanno reached the mouth of the river  Chretes, which forms a sort of natural harbour, but as they  endeavoured to explore this river, they were assailed with showers  of stones from the native negro race, inhabiting the surrounding  country, and driven back, and after this inhospitable reception they  returned to Cerne. We must not omit to add that Hanno mentions  finding large numbers of crocodiles and hippopotami in this river.  Twelve days after this unsuccessful expedition, the fleet reached a  mountainous region, where fragrant trees and shrubs abounded, and it  then entered a vast gulf which terminated in a plain. This region  appeared quite calm during the day, but after nightfall it was  illumined by tongues of flame, which might have proceeded from fires  lighted by the natives, or from the natural ignition of the dry  grass when the rainy season was over.    In five days, Hanno doubled the Cape, known as the Hespera Keras,  there, according to his own account, \"he heard the sound of fifes,  cymbals, and tambourines, and the clamour of a multitude of people.\"  The soothsayers, who accompanied the party of Carthaginian explorers,  counselled flight from this land of terrors, and, in obedience to  their advice, they set sail again, still taking a southerly course.  They arrived at a cape, which, stretching southwards, formed a gulf,  called Notu Keras, and, according to M. D'Avezac, this gulf must  have been the mouth of the river Ouro, which falls into the Atlantic  almost within the Tropic of Cancer. At the lower end of this gulf,  they found an island inhabited by a vast number of gorillas, which  the Carthaginians mistook for hairy savages. They contrived to get  possession of three female gorillas, but were obliged to kill them  on account of their great ferocity.    This Notu Keras must have been the extreme limit reached by the  Carthaginian explorers, and though some historians incline to the  belief that they only went to Bojador, which is two degrees North of  the tropics, it is more probable that the former account is the true  one, and that Hanno, finding himself short of provisions, returned  northwards to Carthage, where he had the account of his voyage  engraved in the temple of Baal Moloch.    After Hanno, the most illustrious of ancient travellers, was  Herodotus, who has been called the \"Father of History,\" and who was  the nephew of the poet Panyasis, whose poems ranked with those of  Homer and Hesiod. It will serve our purpose better if we only speak  of Herodotus as a traveller, not an historian, as we wish to follow  him so far as possible through the countries that he traversed.    Herodotus was born at Halicarnassus, a town in Asia Minor, in the  year B.C. 484. His family were rich, and having large commercial  transactions they were able to encourage the taste for explorations  which he showed. At this time there were many different opinions as  to the shape of the earth: the Pythagorean school having even then  begun to teach that it must be round, but Herodotus took no part in  this discussion, which was of the deepest interest to learned men of  that time, and, still young, he left home with a view of exploring  with great care all the then known world, and especially those parts  of it of which there were but few and uncertain data.    He left Halicarnassus in 464, being then twenty years of age, and  probably directed his steps first to Egypt, visiting Memphis,  Heliopolis, and Thebes. He seems to have specially turned his  attention to the overflow of the banks of the Nile, and he gives an  account of the different opinions held as to the source of this  river, which the Egyptians worshipped as one of their deities. \"When  the Nile overflows its banks,\" he says, \"you can see nothing but the  towns rising out of the water, and they appear like the islands in  the AEgean Sea.\" He tells of the religious ceremonies among the  Egyptians, their sacrifices, their ardour in celebrating the feasts  in honour of their goddess Isis, which took place principally at  Busiris (whose ruins may still be seen near Bushir), and of the  veneration paid to both wild and tame animals, which were looked  upon almost as sacred, and to whom they even rendered funeral  honours at their death. He depicts in the most faithful colours, the  Nile crocodile, its form, habits, and the way in which it is caught,  and the hippopotamus, the momot, the phoenix, the ibis, and the  serpents that were consecrated to the god Jupiter. Nothing can be  more life-like than his accounts of Egyptian customs, and the  notices of their habits, their games, and their way of embalming the  dead, in which the chemists of that period seem to have excelled.  Then we have the history of the country from Menes, its first king,  downwards to Herodotus' time, and he describes the building of the  Pyramids under Cheops, the Labyrinth that was built a little above  the Lake Moeris (of which the remains were discovered in A.D. 1799)"]]]
