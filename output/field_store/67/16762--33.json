Affection for her husband and for his memory prevented her  apologising for it, and her children were not of the sort to apologise  for their existence. A series of petty slights, small unkindnesses,  imbittered the mind of the poverty-stricken widow against her unmarried  sisters, and her feeling was strongly inherited by her children.    A house in Old Aberdeen has been already mentioned as the abode of Mrs  Margaret Brown, Dr Burton's last surviving aunt. This quaint old house  had been purchased by Mrs Brown's grandmother, mother of the laird of  Grandholm, and at the beginning of the century was inhabited by her  maiden daughter Margaret, or, as she was oftener called, Peggy Paton.  This lady lived to the age of ninety, and at her death left her house  and fortune to her niece and name-daughter, Margaret Paton (Mrs Brown),  who in her turn adopted a grand-niece, the daughter already mentioned of  Dr Burton's eldest brother, William,--the same who, having nursed her  aged aunt till her death, in the last year of his life so tenderly  ministered to her uncle, the subject of this notice.    The second in the line of female owners of the old house, Peggy Paton,  was, for the outer world, what George Eliot calls \"a charicter\"--one of  those distinguishing features of country-town life which the march of  improvement has swept away: a lady by birth, but owing little to  schools or teachers, books or travel: a woman of strong natural  understanding and some wit, who loved her nightly rubber at whist, could  rap out an oath or a strong pleasantry, and whose quick estimates of men  and things became proverbs with the younger generation.    For her inner circle Peggy Paton was a most motherly old maid. She it  was who, when she found her niece Eliza _would_ marry Lieutenant Burton,  mediated between father and daughter, and arranged matters as well as  might be in an affair in which her good sense found much to disapprove,  and her heart much to excuse. Not only to her niece Margaret, her  adopted daughter, but also to her other nieces at Grandholm, motherless  by death, and fatherless by desertion, did she fill a mother's part as  far as these robust virgins would permit her. Sister Eliza's rough  little children, or rougher great boys, always found kindness in the  house in the Old Town, first in their grand-aunt's[4] time, and  afterwards in that of her successor, Mrs Brown. David, Dr Burton's  younger brother, was lovingly tended by them during part of the  lingering illness of which he died, and the youngest of Eliza Paton's  sons remained an inmate of Mrs Brown's house that he might continue his  education in Aberdeen, when his mother removed to Edinburgh.    [Footnote 4: It may not be counted indelicate, as it refers to a period  120 years gone by, to mention that Peggy Paton once had a lover, and  that this, her first lover, was no other than the son of that Moir of  Stoneywood, whose correspondence is so frequently quoted in Dr Burton's  'History of Scotland.' The young man was Peggy's first cousin, the  lairds of Grandholm and Stoneywood having married sisters--Mackenzie by  name. The laird of Stoneywood is known to posterity by his ingenious  achievement of ferrying the rebel army across the Dornoch Firth in small  fishing-boats collected by Stoneywood all along the coast. On the defeat  of the Pretender, and the suppression of the insurrection in 1746,  Stoneywood's estate was confiscated, and he fled to the Continent.  Family tradition adds that his escape was achieved by his disguising  himself as a miller and swimming across the Don from Stoneywood to  Grandholm, where the laird of Grandholm, who was of opposite politics,  had removed the ferry-boat, and saw but did not denounce his kinsman.  The houses of Grandholm and Stoneywood are exactly opposite each other  on the two sides of the Don. Mrs Moir of Stoneywood did not immediately  follow her husband, but remained with her friends to bring up her  children, among them Miss Peggy's lover, who, soon after his engagement  to her, joined his father on the Continent and there died.]    For those who do not know Aberdeen, it may be proper to say that _Old_  Aberdeen is as entirely distinct from New Aberdeen as Edinburgh is from  Leith--in a different way. The distance between them is somewhat  greater, about two miles; and whereas New Aberdeen is a highly  prosperous commercial city, as entirely devoid of beauty or interest as  any city under the sun, Old Aberdeen is a sweet, still, little place,  hardly more than a village in size, in appearance utterly unlike any  other place in Scotland, resembling a little English cathedral  town,--the towers and spires of college and cathedral beautifully seen  through ancient trees from the windows of Miss Peggy Paton's old house,  to which that managing lady added a wing, and which possessed a good  flower and fruit garden, wherein grew plenty of gooseberries, ever Dr  Burton's favourite fruit. His birthday, 22d August, was, during his  mother's life, always celebrated by a family feast of them.    Such were the scenes and circumstances of Dr Burton's childhood and  early youth. As he grew old enough to begin those long walks which to  the end were the great pleasure of his life, he made acquaintance with  the beautiful scenery of the Upper Dee and Don. In holiday time his  mother used to give him a small sum of money, at most one pound, and  allow him to travel as far as the amount would take him. His legs were  almost always his only conveyance; throughout his life he entertained an  aversion to either riding or driving. His temper was too impatient, too  energetic, to allow him to enjoy progress without exertion. After  railways existed he sometimes used them in aid of his walking power; but  all horse vehicles were odious to him, partly by reason of an excessive  tenderness for animals. He could not bear to see a horse whipped, or any  living creature subjected to bodily pain.    Wonderful are the accounts the writer has heard of the duration of that  holiday pound: how Dr Burton and sometimes a chosen companion would  subsist day after day on twopence-worth of oatmeal, that by so doing  they might travel the farther; or how, having improvidently finished  their supply, they would walk some incredible distance without any food  at all, till they reached either their home or the house of some friend.    In these holiday rambles Dr Burton made the acquaintance of several  families either more or less related to him through his Grandholm  kindred, or willing, in the old Scotch fashion, to extend hospitality to  any wayfarer who needed it. In this way Dr Burton has described himself  as the guest of Mrs Gordon at Abergeldie, who, as he said, made a  request that when he came to visit her he would if possible arrive  before midnight. Invercauld, Glenkindie, Tough, and many other  country-houses, were visited in the same unceremonious way.    The letter here given was written to his mother during one of these  holiday rambles, when its writer was about twenty, and describes some of  the scenes of the wonderful flood of '29, so graphically described by  Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. The Colonel H. was the son of Dr Burton's  godfather, and a man of mature years at the time the Highlander and Dr  Burton describe him as having \"run away.\" The writer can offer no  explanation of this rather amusing passage in the letter: it might  either be a mere joke or refer to some family quarrel of the Colonel's.         \"LAKEFIELD, _8th September 1829_.         \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I have just arrived at Lakefield in the midst of       determined and ceaseless rain. I expected of course to meet A.H.       here, but it seems he ran away the other day, and will by this time       be in Aberdeen. He wrote to Mrs Grant from Elgin, but she has not       yet heard of his arrival in Aberdeen.         \"In my way here I ran a risk of being violently used for his sake.       As I was perambulating slowly the border of Loch Ness I met a tall,       gaunt-looking man, who eyed me rather suspiciously, and stretched       forth his hands in the attitude of one interrupting a stray sheep.       I looked at the being in my turn, and began to be a little       suspicious of his purpose, and to think of my dirk. The man       approached nearer still in the attitude of making a spring. When he       had come so close that I could hardly escape him, he roared out:       'Is't you 'at's the laad Colonel H. 'at's been runnan' awa'?' 'No,'       said I, 'I am not.'         \"The man continued to eye me rather suspiciously, and then went       slowly away. I suppose he hoped to be rewarded for me. I have told       you that I got rain. When I was proceeding to Huntly, as you are       aware, in the coach, there came two or three heavy gusts of wind       from the hills, carrying along with it a sort of soft drizzle, but       nothing like rain, and the roads appeared dry. After I had passed       Keith, however, the whole country had a drenched and draggled       appearance, the burns were swollen, the corn was hanging like wet       hair, the trees were drooping and black, and the country people       themselves looked as if they had been held in water for the last       six months. A heavy and unceasing rain came on. The clouds grew       black and seemed to settle, everything had a ghastly and dismal       appearance. I met a man, and asked him if it always rained here.       'Ou ay, sir,' replied he, 'it's the parish o' _Rayne_.' I was       content with the answer, and asked nothing more. In a condition you       may easily imagine, I reached Elgin and dried myself. The rain       stopped, but the clouds did not clear. I went and visited the       cathedral, and wandered about the ruins for an hour or two. It is a       noble and beautiful building, but I will not begin to speak about   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22153"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Rome (#3)"],[1,"Glabriones? The queries were fully answered by  later discoveries; four inscriptions, naming Manius Acilius ... and  his wife Priscilla, Acilius Rufinus, Acilius Quintianus, and Claudius  Acilius Valerius were found among the debris, so that there is no  doubt as to the ownership of the crypt, and of the chapel which opens  at the end of the longer arm of the [Greek: G].    The Manii Acilii Glabriones attained celebrity in the sixth century of  Rome, when Acilius Glabrio, consul in 563 (B. C. 191), conquered the  Macedonians at the battle of Thermopylai. We have in Rome two records  of his career: the Temple of Piety, erected by him on the west side of  the Forum Olitorium, now transformed into the church of S. Nicola in  Carcere; and the pedestal of the equestrian statue, of gilt bronze,  offered to him by his son, the first of its kind ever seen in Italy,  which was discovered by Valadier in 1808, at the foot of the steps of  the temple, and buried again. Towards the end of the republic we find  them established on the Pincian Hill, where they had built a palace  and laid out gardens which extended at least from the convent of the  Trinita dei Monti to the Villa Borghese.[3] The family had grown so  rapidly to honor, splendor, and wealth, that Pertinax, in the  memorable sitting of the Senate in which he was elected emperor,  proclaimed them the noblest race in the world.    The Glabrio best known in the history of the first century is Manius  Acilius, who was consul with Trajan, A. D. 91. He was put to death by  Domitian in the year 95, as related by Suetonius (_Domit._ 10): \"He  caused several senators and ex-consuls to be executed on the charge of  their conspiring against the empire,--_quasi molitores rerum  novarum_,--among them Civica Cerealis, governor of Asia, Salvidienus  Orfitus, and Acilius Glabrio, who had previously been banished from  Rome.\"    The expression _molitores rerum novarum_ has a political meaning in  the case of Cerealis and Orfitus, both staunch pagans, and a religious  and political one in the case of Glabrio, a convert to the Christian  faith, called _nova superstitio_ by Suetonius and Tacitus. Other  details of Glabrio's fate are given by Dion Cassius, Juvenal, and  Fronto. We are told by these authors that during his consulship, A. D.  91, and before his banishment, he was compelled by Domitian to fight  against a lion and two bears in the amphitheatre adjoining the  emperor's villa at Albanum. The event created such an impression in  Rome, and its memory lasted so long that, half a century later, we  find it given by Fronto as a subject for a rhetorical composition to  his pupil Marcus Aurelius. The amphitheatre is still in existence, and  was excavated in 1887. Like the one at Tusculum, it is partly hollowed  out of the rocky side of the mountain, partly built of stone and  rubble work. It well deserves a visit from the student and the  tourist, on account of its historical associations, and of the  admirable view which its ruins command of the vine-clad slopes of  Albano and Castel Savello, the wooded plains of Ardea and Lavinium,  the coast of the Tyrrhenian, and the islands of Pontia and Pandataria.    Xiphilinus states that, in the year 95, some members of the imperial  family were condemned by Domitian on the charge of atheism, together  with other leading personages who had embraced \"the customs and  persuasion of the Jews,\" that is, the Christian faith. Manius Acilius  Glabrio, the ex-consul, was implicated in the same trial, and  condemned on the same indictment with the others. Among these the  historian mentions Clemens and Domitilla, who were manifestly  Christians. One particular of the case, related by Juvenal, confirms  the account of Xiphilinus. He says that in order to mitigate the wrath  of the emperor and avoid a catastrophe, Acilius Glabrio, after  fighting the wild beasts at Albanum, assumed an air of stupidity. In  this alleged stupidity it is easy to recognize the prejudice so common  among the pagans, to whom the Christians' retirement from the joys of  the world, their contempt of public honors, and their modest behavior  appeared as _contemptissima inertia_, most despicable laziness. This  is the very phrase used by Suetonius in speaking of Flavius Clemens,  who was murdered by Domitian _ex tenuissima suspicione_, on a very  slight suspicion of his faith.    [Illustration: Map of the Via Salaria.]    Glabrio was put to death in his place of exile, the name of which is  not known. His end helped, no doubt, the propagation of the gospel  among his relatives and descendants, as well as among the servants and  freedmen of the house, as shown by the noble sarcophagi and the  humbler loculi found in such numbers in the crypt of the Catacombs of  Priscilla. The small oratory at the southern end of the crypt seems to  have been consecrated exclusively to the memory of its first occupant,  the ex-consul. The date and the circumstances connected with the  translation of his relics from the place of banishment to Rome are  not known.    Both the chapel and the crypt were found in a state of devastation  hardly credible, as though the plunderers had taken pleasure in  satisfying their vandalic instincts to the utmost. Each of the  sarcophagi was broken into a hundred pieces; the mosaics of the walls  and ceiling had been wrenched from their sockets, cube by cube, the  marble incrustations torn off, the altar dismantled, the bones  dispersed.    When did this wholesale destruction take place? In times much nearer  ours than the reader may imagine. I have been able to ascertain the  date, with the help of an anecdote related by Pietro Sante Bartoli in  Sec. 144 of his archaeological memoirs: \"Excavations were made under  Innocent X. (1634-1655), and Clement IX. (1667-1670), in the Monte  delle Gioie, on the Via Salaria, with the hope of discovering a  certain hidden treasure. The hope was frustrated; but, deep in the  bowels of the mound, some crypts were found, encrusted with white  stucco, and remarkable for their neatness and preservation. I have  heard from trustworthy men that the place is haunted by spirits, as is  proved by what happened to them not many months ago. While assembled  on the Monte delle Gioie for a picnic, the conversation turned upon  the ghosts who haunted the crypt below, when suddenly the carriage  which had brought them there, pushed by invisible hands, began to roll  down the slope of the hill, and was ultimately precipitated into the  river Anio at its base. Several oxen had to be used to haul the  vehicle out of the stream. This happened to Tabarrino, butcher at S.  Eustachio, and to his brothers living in the Via Due Macelli, whose  faces still bear marks of the great terror experienced that day.\"    There is no doubt that the anecdote refers to the tomb of the Acilii  Glabriones, which is cut under the Monte delle Gioie, and is the only  one in the Catacombs of Priscilla remarkable for a coating of white  stucco. Its destruction, therefore, took place under Clement IX., and  was the work of treasure-hunters. And the very nature of clandestine  excavations, which are the work of malicious, ignorant, and suspicious  persons, explains the reason why no mention of the discovery was made  to contemporary archaeologists, and the pleasure of re-discovering the  secret of the Acilii Glabriones was reserved for us.    These are by no means the only patricians of high standing whose names  have come to light from the depths of the catacombs. Tacitus (_Annal._  xiii. 32) tells how Pomponia Graecina, wife of Plautius, the conqueror  of Britain, was accused of \"foreign superstition,\" tried by her  husband, and acquitted. These words long since gave rise to a  conjecture that Pomponia Graecina was a Christian, and recent  discoveries put it beyond doubt. An inscription bearing the name of  [Greek: POMPONIOS GREKEINOS] has been found in the Cemetery of  Callixtus, together with other records of the Pomponii Attici and  Bassi. Some scholars think that Graecina, the wife of the conqueror of  Britain, is no other than Lucina, the Christian matron who interred  her brethren in Christ in her own property, at the second milestone of  the Appian Way.    Other evidence of the conquests made by the gospel among the  patricians is given by an inscription discovered in March, 1866, in  the Catacombs of Praetextatus, near the monument of Quirinus the  martyr. It is a memorial raised to the memory of his departed wife by  Postumius Quietus, consul A. D. 272. Here also was found the name of  Urania, daughter of Herodes Atticus, by his second wife, Vibullia  Alcia,[4] while on the other side of the road, near S. Sebastiano, a  mausoleum has been found, on the architrave of which the name  URANIOR[UM] is engraved.    In chapter vii. I shall have occasion to refer to many Christian  relatives of the emperors Vespasian and Domitian. Eusebius, in  speaking of these Flavians, and particularly of Domitilla the younger,  niece of Domitian, quotes the authority of the historian Bruttius. He  evidently means Bruttius Praesens, the illustrious friend of Pliny the  younger, and the grandfather of Crispina, the empress of Commodus. In  1854, near the entrance to the crypt of the Flavians, at Torre  Marancia (Via Ardeatina), a fragment of a sarcophagus was found, with  the name of Bruttius Crispinus. If, therefore, the history of  Domitilla's martyrdom was written by the grandfather of Bruttia  Crispina, the empress, it seems probable that the two families were  united not only by the close proximity of their villas and tombs, and  by friendship, but especially by community of religion.    I may also cite the names of several Cornelii, Caecilii, and AEmilii,  the flower of Roman nobility, grouped near the graves of S. Caecilia  and Pope Cornelius; of Liberalis, a _consul suffectus_,[5] and a  martyr, whose remains were buried in the Via Salaria; of Jallia  Clementina, a"]]]
