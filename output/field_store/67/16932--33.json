HEADS AND TALES.          MAN.      In this collection, like Linnaeus, we begin with man as undoubtedly an  animal, as opposed to a vegetable or mineral. Like Professor Owen, we  are inclined to fancy he is well entitled to separate rank from even the  Linnaean order, _Primates_, and to have more systematic honour conferred  on him than what Cuvier allowed him. That great French naturalist placed  man in a section separate from his four-handed order, _Quadrumana_, and,  from his two hands and some other qualities, enrolled our race in an  order, _Bimana_. Surely the ancients surpassed many modern naturalists  of the Lamarckian school, who would derive him from an ourang, a  chimpanzee, or a gorilla. One of them has nobly said--         \"Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri.\"    Our own Sir William Hamilton, in a few powerful words has condensed what  will ever be, we are thankful to suppose, the general idea of most men,  be they naturalists or not, that mind and soul have much to distinguish  us from every other animal:--    \"What man holds of matter does not make up his personality. Man is not  an organism. He is an intelligence served by organs. _They are_ HIS,  _not_ HE.\"    As a mere specimen, we subjoin two or three anecdotes, although the  species, _Homo sapiens_, has supplied, and might supply, many volumes of  anecdotes touching on his whims and peculiarities. As a good example of  the Scottish variety, who is there that does not know Dean Ramsay's  \"Reminiscences?\" Surely each nation requires a similar judicious  selection. Mr Punch, especially when aided by his late admirable artist,  John Leech, shows seemingly that John Bull and his family are as  distinct from the French, as the French are from the Yankees.      THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH THE ARTIST, AND THE TAILOR.    Gainsborough, the painter, was very ready-witted. His biographer[2]  records the following anecdote of him as very likely to be authentic.  The great artist occasionally made sketches from an honest old tailor,  of the name of Fowler, who had a picturesque countenance and silver-gray  locks. On the chimney-piece of his painting-room, among other  curiosities, was a beautiful preparation of an infant _cranium_,  presented to the painter by his old friend, Surgeon Cruickshanks.  Fowler, without moving his position, continually peered at it askance  with inquisitive eye. \"Ah! Master Fowler,\" said the painter, \"that is a  mighty curiosity.\" \"What might it be, sir, if I may be so bold?\" \"A  _whale's eye_,\" replied Gainsborough. \"Oh! not so; never say so, Muster  Gainsborough. Laws! sir, it is a little child's skull!\" \"You have hit  upon it,\" said the wag. \"Why, Fowler, you are a witch! But what will you  think when I tell you that it is the skull of _Julius Caesar_ when he was  a little boy?\" \"Do you say so!\" exclaimed Fowler, \"what a phenomenon!\"    This reminds us of a similar story told of a countryman, who was shown  the so-called skull of Oliver Cromwell at the museum in Oxford, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#3)"],[1,"um. Others soon learn that it is  detrimental to their health. Mayhap the same laws obtain in the bird  realm.    The altitude of my home is eight hundred and eighty feet above  sea-level; that of Denver, Colorado, six thousand one hundred and sixty,  making a difference of over five thousand feet, which may account for  the absence of many eastern avian forms in the more elevated districts.  Some day the dissector of birds may find a real difference in the  physiological structure of the eastern and western meadow-larks. If so,  it is to be hoped he will at once publish his discoveries for the  satisfaction of all lovers of birds.    If one had time and opportunity, some intensely interesting experiments  might be tried. Suppose an eastern blue jay should be carried to the top  of Pike's Peak, or Gray's, and then set free, how would he fare? Would  the muscles and tendons of his wings have sufficient strength to bear  him up in the rarefied atmosphere? One may easily imagine that he would  go wabbling helplessly over the granite boulders, unable to lift himself  more than a few feet in the air, while the pipit and the leucosticte,  inured to the heights, would mount up to the sky and shout \"Ha! ha!\" in  good-natured raillery at the blue tenderfoot. And would the feathered  visitor feel a constriction in his chest and be compelled to gasp for  breath, as the human tourists invariably do? It is even doubtful whether  any eastern bird would be able to survive the changed meteorological  conditions, Nature having designed him for a different environment.          INTRODUCTION TO SOME SPECIES      It was night when I found lodgings in the picturesque village of  Manitou, nestling at the foot of the lower mountains that form the  portico to Pike's Peak. Early the next morning I was out for a stroll  along the bush-fringed mountain brook which had babbled me a serenade  all night. To my delight, the place was rife with birds, the first to  greet me being robins, catbirds, summer warblers, and warbling vireos,  all of which, being well known in the East, need no description, but are  mentioned here only to show the reader that some avian species are  common to both the East and the West.    But let me pause to pay a little tribute to the brave robin redbreast.  Of course, here he is called the \"western robin.\" His distribution is an  interesting scientific fact. I found him everywhere--on the arid plains  and mesas, in the solemn pines of the deep gulches and passes, and among  the scraggy trees bordering on timber-line, over ten thousand feet above  sea-level. In Colorado the robins are designated as \"western,\" forms by  the system-makers, but, even though called by a modified title, they  deport themselves, build their nests, and sing their \"cheerily,  cheerily, cheer up,\" just as do their brothers and sisters of the land  toward the rising sun. If there is any difference, their songs are not  so loud and ringing, and their breasts not quite so ruddy as are those  of the eastern types. Perhaps the incessant sunshine of Colorado  bleaches out the tints somewhat.    But in my ante-breakfast stroll at Manitou I soon stumbled upon  feathered strangers. What was this little square-shouldered bird that  kept uttering a shrill scream, which he seemed to mistake for a song? It  was the western wood-pewee. Instead of piping the sweet, pensive  \"Pe-e-e-o-we-e-e-e\" of the woodland bird of the Eastern States, this  western swain persists in ringing the changes hour by hour upon that  piercing scream, which sounds more like a cry of anguish than a song. At  Buena Vista, where these birds are superabundant, their morning concerts  were positively painful. One thing must be said, however, in defence of  the western wood-pewee--he means well.    Another acquaintance of my morning saunter was the debonair Arkansas  goldfinch, which has received its bunglesome name, not from the State of  Arkansas, but from the Arkansas River, dashing down from the mountains  and flowing eastwardly through the southern part of Colorado. Most  nattily this little bird wears his black cap, his olive-green frock,  and his bright yellow vest. You will see at once that he dresses  differently from the American goldfinch, so well known in the East, and,  for that matter, just as well known on the plains of Colorado, where  both species dwell in harmony. There are some white markings on the  wings of _Spinus psaltria_ that give them a gauze-like appearance when  they are rapidly fluttered.    His song and some of his calls bear a close resemblance to those of the  common goldfinch, but he is by no means a mere duplicate of that bird;  he has an individuality of his own. While his flight is undulatory, the  waviness is not so deeply and distinctly marked; nor does he sing a  cheery cradle-song while swinging through the ether, although he often  utters a series of unmusical chirps. One of the most pleasingly pensive  sounds heard in my western rambles was the little coaxing call of this  bird, whistled mostly by the female, I think. No doubt it is the tender  love talk of a young wife or mother, which may account for its  surpassing sweetness.    Every lover of feathered kind is interested in what may be called  comparative ornithology, and therefore I wish to speak of another  western form and its eastern prototype--Bullock's oriole, which in  Colorado takes the place of the Baltimore oriole known east of the  plains all the way to the Atlantic coast. However, Bullock's is not  merely a variety or subspecies, but a well-defined species of the oriole  family, his scientific title being _Icterus bullocki_.    Like our familiar Lord Baltimore, he bravely bears black and orange; but  in _bullocki_ the latter color invades the sides of the neck, head, and  forehead, leaving only a small black bow for the throat and a narrow  black stripe running back over the crown and down the back of the neck;  whereas in _Icterus galbula_ the entire head and neck are black.  Brilliant as Bullock's oriole is, he does not seem to be anxious to  display his fineries, for he usually makes it a point to keep himself  ensconced behind a clump of foliage, so that, while you may hear a  desultory piping in the trees, apparently inviting your confidence, it  will be a long time before you can get more than a provoking glimpse of  the jolly piper himself. \"My gorgeous apparel was not made for parade,\"  seems to be his modest disclaimer.    He is quite a vocalist. Here is a quotation from my lead-pencil, dashes  and all: \"Bullock's oriole--fine singer--voice stronger than orchard  oriole's--song not quite so well articulated or so elaborate, but louder  and more resonant--better singer than the Baltimore.\" It might be added  that Bullock's, like the orchard, but unlike the Baltimore, pipes a real  tune, with something of a theme running through its intermittent  outbursts. The plumage of the young bird undergoes some curious  changes, and what I took to be the year-old males seemed to be the most  spirited musicians.    Maurice Thompson's tribute to the Baltimore oriole will apply to that  bird's western kinsman. He calls him:--        \"Athlete of the air--      Of fire and song a glowing core;\"    and then adds, with tropical fervor:        \"A hot flambeau on either wing        Rimples as you pass me by;      'T is seeing flame to hear you sing,        'T is hearing song to see you fly.           *       *       *       *       *        \"When flowery hints foresay the berry,        On spray of haw and tuft of brier,      Then, wandering incendiary,        You set the maple swamps afire!\"    Many nests of Bullock's oriole rewarded my slight search. They are  larger and less compactly woven than the Baltimore's, and have a woolly  appearance exteriorly, as if the down of the Cottonwood trees had been  wrought into the fabric. Out on the plains I counted four dangling  nests, old and new, on one small limb; but that, of course, was unusual,  there being only one small clump of trees within a radius of many  miles.    In the vicinity of Manitou many trips were taken by the zealous  pedestrian. Some of the dry, steep sides of the first range of mountains  were hard climbing, but it was necessary to make the effort in order to  discover their avian resources. One of the first birds met with on these  unpromising acclivities was the spurred towhee of the Rockies. In his  attire he closely resembles the towhee, or \"chewink,\" of the East, but  has as an extra ornament a beautiful sprinkling of white on his back and  wings, which makes him look as if he had thrown a gauzy mantle of silver  over his shoulders.    But his song is different from our eastern towhee's. My notes say that  it is \"a cross between the song of the chewink and that of dickcissel,\"  and I shall stand by that assertion until I find good reason to disown  it--should that time ever come. The opening syllabication is like  dickcissel's; then follows a trill of no specially definable character.  There are times when he sings with more than his wonted force, and it is  then that his tune bears the strongest likeness to the eastern towhee's.  But his alarm-call! It is no \"chewink\" at all, but almost as close a  reproduction of a cat's mew as is the catbird's well-known call. Such  crosses and anomalies does this country produce!    On the arid mountain sides among the stunted bushes, cactus plants,  sand, and rocks, this quaint bird makes his home, coming down into the  valleys to drink at the tinkling brooks and trill his roundelays. Many,  many times, as I was following a deep fissure in the mountains, his  ditty came dripping down to me from some spot far up the steep mountain  side--a little cascade of song mingling with the cascades of the brooks.  The nests are usually placed under a bush on the sides of the mesas and  mountains.    And would you believe it? Colorado furnishes another towhee, though why  he should have"]]]
