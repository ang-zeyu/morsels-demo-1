The latter received a copy of the decision arrived at by the  bishop, before Grandier knew of the charges that had been formulated  against him, and having in the course of his defence drawn a terrible  picture of the immorality of Grandier's life, he produced as a proof of  the truth of his assertions the damning document which had been put into  his hands. The court, not knowing what to think of the turn affairs had  taken, decided that before considering the accusations brought by  Grandier, he must appear before his bishop to clear himself of the  charges, brought against himself. Consequently he left Paris at once,  and arrived at Loudun, where he only stayed long enough to learn what  had happened in his absence, and then went on to Poitiers in order to  draw up his defence. He had, however, no sooner set foot in the place  than he was arrested by a sheriff's officer named Chatry, and confined  in the prison of the episcopal palace.    It was the middle of November, and the prison was at all times cold and  damp, yet no attention was paid to Grandier's request that he should be  transferred to some other place of confinement. Convinced by this that  his enemies had more influence than he had supposed, he resolved to  possess his soul in patience, and remained a prisoner for two months,  during which even his warmest friends believed him lost, while Duthibaut  openly laughed at the proceedings instituted against himself, which he  now believed would never go any farther, and Barot had already selected  one of his heirs, a certain Ismael Boulieau, as successor to Urbain as  priest and prebendary.    It was arranged that the costs of the lawsuit should be defrayed out of  a fund raised by the prosecutors, the rich paying for the poor; for as  all the witnesses lived at Loudun and the trial was to take place at  Poitiers, considerable expense would be incurred by the necessity of  bringing so many people such a distance; but the lust of vengeance  proved stronger than the lust of gold; the subscription expected from  each being estimated according to his fortune, each paid without a  murmur, and at the end of two months the case was concluded.    In spite of the evident pains taken by the prosecution to strain the  evidence against the defendant, the principal charge could not be  sustained, which was that he had led astray many wives and daughters in  Loudun. No one woman came forward to complain of her ruin by Grandier;  the name of no single victim of his alleged immorality was given. The  conduct of the case was the most extraordinary ever seen; it was evident  that the accusations were founded on hearsay and not on fact, and yet a  decision and sentence against Grandier were pronounced on January 3rd,  1630. The sentence was as follows: For three months to fast each Friday  on bread and water by way of penance; to be inhibited from the  performance of clerical functions in the diocese of Poitiers for five  years, and in the town of Loudun for ever.    Both parties appealed from this decision: Grandier to the Archbishop of  Bordeaux, and his adversaries, on the advice of the attorney to the  diocese, pleading a miscarriage of justice, to the Parliament of Paris;  this last appeal being made in order to overwhelm Grandier and break his  spirit. But Grandier's resolution enabled him to face this attack  boldly: he engaged counsel to defend his case before the Parliament,  while he himself conducted his appeal to the Archbishop of Bordeaux. But  as there were many necessary witnesses, and it was almost impossible to  bring them all such a great distance, the archiepiscopal court sent the  appeal to the presidial court of Poitiers. The public prosecutor of  Poitiers began a fresh investigation, which being conducted with  impartiality was not encouraging to Grandier's accusers. There had been  many conflicting statements made by the witnesses, and these were now  repeated: other witnesses had declared quite openly that they had been  bribed; others again stated that their depositions had been tampered  with; and amongst these latter was a certain priest named Mechin, and  also that Ishmael Boulieau whom Barot had been in such a hurry to select  as candidate for the reversion of Grandier's preferments. Boulieau's  deposition has been lost, but we can lay Mechin's before the reader, for  the original has been preserved, just as it issued from his pen:    \"I, Gervais Mechin, curate-in-charge of the Church of Saint-Pierre in  the Market Place at Loudun, certify by these presents, signed by my  hand, to relieve my conscience as to a certain report which is being  spread abroad, that I had said in support of an accusation brought by  Gilles Robert, archpriest, against Urbain Grandier, priest-in-charge of  Saint-Pierre, that I had found the said Grandier lying with women and  girls in the church of Saint Pierre, the doors being closed.    \"ITEM. that on several different occasions, at unsuitable hours both day  and night, I had seen women and girls disturb the said Grandier by going  into his bedroom, and that some of the said women remained with him from  one o'clock in the after noon till three o'clock the next morning, their  maids bringing them their suppers and going away again at once.    \"ITEM. that I had seen the said Grandier in the church, the doors being  open, but that as soon as some women entered he closed them.    \"As I earnestly desire that such reports should cease, I declare by  these presents that I have never seen the said Grandier with women or  girls in the church, the doors being closed; that I have never found him  there alone with women or girls; that when he spoke to either someone  else was always present, and the doors were open; and as to their  posture, I think I made it sufficiently clear when in the witness-box  that Grandier was seated and the women scattered over the church;  furthermore, I have never seen either women or girls enter Grandier's  bedroom either by day or night, although it is true that I have heard  people in the corridor coming and going late in the evening, who they  were I cannot say, but a brother of the said Grandier sleeps close by;  neither have I any knowledge that either women or girls, had their  suppers brought to the said room. I have also never said that he  neglected the reading of his breviary, because that would be contrary to  the truth, seeing that on several occasions he borrowed mine and read  his hours in it. I also declare that I have never seen him close the  doors of the church, and that whenever I have seen him speaking to women  I have never noticed any impropriety; I have not ever seen him touch  them in any way, they have only spoken together; and if anything is  found in my deposition contrary to the above, it is without my  knowledge, and was never read to me, for I would not have signed it, and  I say and affirm all this in homage to the truth.    \"Done the last day of October 1630, \"(Signed) G. MECHIN.\"    In the face of such proofs of innocence none of the accusations could be  considered as established and so, according to the decision of the  presidial court of Poitiers, dated the 25th of May 1634, the decision of  the bishop's court was reversed, and Grandier was acquitted of the  charges brought against him. However, he had still to appear before the  Archbishop of Bordeaux, that his acquittal might be ratified. Grandier  took advantage of a visit which the archbishop paid to his abbey at  Saint-Jouin-les-Marmes, which was only three leagues from Loudun, to  make this appearance; his adversaries, who were discouraged by the  result of the proceedings at Poitiers, scarcely made any defence, and  the archbishop, after an examination which brought clearly to light the  innocence of the accused, acquitted and absolved him.    The rehabilitation of Grandier before his bishop had two important  results: the first was that it clearly established his innocence, and  the second that it brought into prominence his high attainments and  eminent qualities. The archbishop seeing the persecutions to which he  was subjected, felt a kindly interest in him, and advised him to  exchange into some other diocese, leaving a town the principal  inhabitants of which appeared to have vowed him a relentless hate. But  such an abandonment of his rights was foreign to the character of  Urbain, and he declared to his superior that, strong in His Grace's  approbation and the testimony of his own conscience, he would remain in  the place to which God had called him. Monseigneur de Sourdis did not  feel it his duty to urge Urbain any further, but he had enough insight  into his character to perceive that if Urbain should one day fall, it  would be, like Satan, through pride; for he added another sentence to  his decision, recommending him to fulfil the duties of his office with  discretion and modesty, according to the decrees of the Fathers and the  canonical constitutions. The triumphal entry of Urbain into Loudun with  which we began our narrative shows the spirit in which he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#3)"],[1,"knew what remedies to prescribe better than any physician, for it  seldom happened that he or his had not felt the same ailments, and his  knowledge, founded on personal experience, produced the most excellent  results. Moreover, he had no interest, as ordinary doctors have, in  prolonging illnesses. For many years past the only formality recognised  as a guarantee for the inviolability of a contract had been the  intervention of the fisherman. Each party shook hands with Solomon, and  the thing was done. They would rather have thrown themselves into  Vesuvius at the moment of its most violent eruption than have broken so  solemn an agreement. At the period when our story opens, it was  impossible to find any person in the island who had not felt the effects  of the fisherman's generosity, and that without needing to confess to  him any necessities. As it was the custom for the little populace of  Nisida to spend its leisure hours before Solomon's cottage, the old man,  while he walked slowly among the different groups, humming his favourite  song, discovered moral and physical weaknesses as he passed; and the  same evening he or his daughter would certainly be seen coming  mysteriously to bestow a benefit upon every sufferer, to lay a balm upon  every wound. In short, he united in his person all those occupations  whose business is to help mankind. Lawyers, doctors, and the notary, all  the vultures of civilisation, had beaten a retreat before the  patriarchal benevolence of the fisherman. Even the priest had  capitulated.    On the morrow of the Feast of the Assumption, Solomon was sitting, as  his habit was, on a stone bench in front of his house, his legs crossed  and his arms carelessly stretched out. At the first glance you would  have taken him for sixty at the outside, though he was really over  eighty. He had all his teeth, which were as white as pearls, and showed  them proudly. His brow, calm and restful beneath its crown of abundant  white hair, was as firm and polished as marble; not a wrinkle ruffled  the corner of his eye, and the gem-like lustre of his blue orbs revealed  a freshness of soul and an eternal youth such as fable grants to the  sea-gods. He displayed his bare arms and muscular neck with an old man's  vanity. Never had a gloomy idea, an evil prepossession, or a keen  remorse, arisen to disturb his long and peaceful life. He had never seen  a tear flow near him without hurrying to wipe it; poor though he was, he  had succeeded in pouring out benefits that all the kings of the earth  could not have bought with their gold; ignorant though he was, he had  spoken to his fellows the only language that they could understand, the  language of the heart. One single drop of bitterness had mingled with  his inexhaustible stream of happiness; one grief only had clouded his  sunny life--the death of his wife--and moreover he had forgotten that.    All the affections of his soul were turned upon Nisida, whose birth had  caused her mother's death; he loved her with that immoderate love that  old people have for the youngest of their children. At the present  moment he was gazing upon her with an air of profound rapture, and  watching her come and go, as she now joined the groups of children and  scolded them for games too dangerous or too noisy; now seated herself on  the grass beside their mothers and took part with grave and thoughtful  interest in their talk. Nisida was more beautiful thus than she had been  the day before; with the vaporous cloud of perfume that had folded her  round from head to foot had disappeared all that mystic poetry which put  a sort of constraint upon her admirers and obliged them to lower their  glances. She had become a daughter of Eve again without losing anything  of her charm. Simply dressed, as she usually was on work-days, she was  distinguishable among her companions only by her amazing beauty and by  the dazzling whiteness of her skin. Her beautiful black hair was twisted  in plaits around the little dagger of chased silver, that has lately  been imported into Paris by that right of conquest which the pretty  women of Paris have over the fashions of all countries, like the English  over the sea.    Nisida was adored by her young friends, all the mothers had adopted her  with pride; she was the glory of the island. The opinion of her  superiority was shared by everyone to such a degree, that if some bold  young man, forgetting the distance which divided him from the maiden,  dared speak a little too loudly of his pretensions, he became the  laughing-stock of his companions. Even the past masters of tarentella  dancing were out of countenance before the daughter of Solomon, and did  not dare to seek her as a partner. Only a few singers from Amalfi or  Sorrento, attracted by the rare beauty of this angelic creature,  ventured to sigh out their passion, carefully veiled beneath the most  delicate allusions. But they seldom reached the last verse of their  song; at every sound they stopped short, threw down their triangles and  their mandolines, and took flight like scared nightingales.    One only had courage enough or passion enough to brave the mockery; this  was Bastiano, the most formidable diver of that coast. He also sang, but  with a deep and hollow voice; his chant was mournful and his melodies  full of sadness. He never accompanied himself upon any instrument, and  never retired without concluding his song. That day he was gloomier than  usual; he was standing upright, as though by enchantment, upon a bare  and slippery rock, and he cast scornful glances upon the women who were  looking at him and laughing. The sun, which was plunging into the sea  like a globe of fire, shed its light full upon his stern features, and  the evening breeze, as it lightly rippled the billows, set the  fluttering reeds waving at his feet. Absorbed by dark thoughts, he sang,  in the musical language of his country, these sad words:--    \"O window, that wert used to shine in the night like an open eye, how  dark thou art! Alas, alas! my poor sister is ill.    \"Her mother, all in tears, stoops towards me and says, 'Thy poor sister  is dead and buried.'    \"Jesus! Jesus! Have pity on me! You stab me to the heart.    \"Tell me, good neighbours, how it happened; repeat to me her last words.    \"She had a burning thirst, and refused to drink because thou wast not  there to give her water from thy hand.    \"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!    \"She refused her mother's kiss, because thou wast not there to embrace  her.    \"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!    \"She wept until her last breath, because thou wast not there to dry her  tears.    \"Oh, my sister! Oh, my sister!    \"We placed on her brow her wreath of orangeflowers, we covered her with  a veil as white as snow; we laid her gently in her coffin.    \"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.    \"Two angels came down from heaven and bore her away on their wings. Mary  Magdalene came to meet her at the gate of heaven.    \"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.    \"There, she was seated in a place of glory, a chaplet of rubies was  given to her, and she is singing her rosary with the Virgin.    \"Thanks, good neighbours. I will go and be with her.\"    As he finished the last words of his melancholy refrain, he flung  himself from the top of his rock into the sea, as though he really  desired to engulf himself. Nisida and the other women gave a cry of  terror, for during some minutes the diver failed to reappear upon the  surface.    \"Are you out of your senses?\" cried a young man who had suddenly  appeared, unobserved among the women. \"Why, what are you afraid of? You  know very well that Bastiano is always doing things of this sort. But do  not be alarmed: all the fishes in the Mediterranean will be drowned  before any harm comes to him. Water is his natural element. Good-day,  sister; good-day, father.\"    The young fisherman kissed Nisida on the forehead, drew near to his  father, and, bowing his handsome head before him, took off his red cap  and respectfully kissed the old man's hand. He came thus to ask his  blessing every evening before putting out to sea, where he often spent  the night fishing from his boat.    \"May God bless thee, my Gabriel!\" said the old man in a tone of emotion,  as he slowly passed his hand over his son's black curls, and a tear came  into his eye. Then, rising solemnly and addressing the groups around  him, he added in a voice full of dignity and of gentleness. \"Come, my  children, it is time to separate. The young to work, the old to rest.  There is the angelus ringing.\"    Everybody knelt, and after a short prayer each went on his way. Nisida,  after having given her father the last daily attentions, went up to her  room, replenished the oil in the lamp that burned day and night before  the Virgin, and, leaning her elbow on the window ledge, divided the  branches of jasmine which hung like perfumed curtains, began to gaze out  at the sea, and seemed lost in a deep, sweet reverie.    At this very time, a little boat, rowed silently by two oarsmen, touched  shore on the other side of the island. It had become quite dark. A  little man first landed cautiously, and respectfully offered his hand to  another individual, who, scorning that feeble support, leapt easily  ashore.    \"Well, knave,\" he cried, \"are my looks to your taste?\"    \"Your lordship is perfect.\"    \"I flatter myself I am. It is true that, in order to make the  transformation complete, I chose the very oldest coat that displayed its  rags in a Jew's shop.\"    \"Your lordship looks like a heathen god engaged in a love affair.  Jupiter has sheathed his thunderbolts and Apollo has pocketed his rays.\"    \"A truce to your mythology. And, to begin with, I forbid you to call me  'your lordship.'\"    \"Yes, your lordship.\"    \"If my information that I have procured during the day is correct, the  house must be on the other side "]]]
