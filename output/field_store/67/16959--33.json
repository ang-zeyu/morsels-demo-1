Now the back of a cow is the last place where you would think of looking  for a cat; so when the starlings saw the cow coming, they didn't think  it worth while to use their wings, and when the cow was quite close to  the birds--beautiful, fat, delightful birds--- my sister used to pick  out with her eye the fattest starling, and then leap suddenly from the  cow's back on to her prey. She never missed.    \"I have never known,\" said my poor mother with tears of pride in her  green eyes--\"I have never known a cat do anything so clever.\"    \"It's all your doing, mother dear,\" said my sister prettily; \"if you  hadn't taught me so well when I was little, I should never have thought  of it.\" And they kissed each other affectionately.    I showed my claws and growled. My mother shook her tabby head.    \"O Buff,\" she said, \"if you had only been willing to learn when you were  little, you might have been as clever as your sister, instead of  being the great anxiety you are to me.\"    \"And why am I an anxiety?\" I said, ruffling up my fur and my tail, for I  was very angry.    \"Because you are useless,\" she said, \"and not particularly handsome; and  when a cat is useless and not particularly handsome, they sometimes----\"    \"What?\" I said, turning pale to the ends of my ears.    \"They sometimes drown it, Buff,\" she said in a whisper, and turned away  to hide her feelings.    Judge of my own next day when they came into the kitchen and took me up  and put me into a basket. I knew all about drowning. These tales of  horror are told at twilight time in all cat nurseries, and I knew that  if three large stones were put into the basket with me, I might  consider my fate sealed.    It was very uncomfortable in the basket. They carried me upside-down  part of the way, and it was draughty and hard; but, so far, there were  no stones. When they took off the lid of the basket, I found myself  under the shade of a huge moving mountain, that seemed about to fall and  crush me. It was an elephant.    I found that the people where my mother lived had given me to the cook,  who had given me to her cousin, who was engaged to be married to a young  man whose brother-in-law was the elephant's keeper, and so I found  myself in the elephant's house.    There was no milk for me--no heads and tails of fish--no scraps of  meat--no delicious unforeseen morsels of butter.    The elephant was very kind to me. He had once had a friend exactly like  me, he explained, but had unfortunately walked upon him, and now I had  come to fill the vacant place in his large heart.    I resolved at once that he should not walk upon me; but in order to  insure this, I was compelled to enter upon a more active existence than  I had ever known.    When I asked what I was expected to eat, he said--    \"Mice, I suppose; or you can have some of my buns if you like. You might  like them at first, but you will soon get tired of them.\"    But I couldn't eat buns. I was never, from a kitten, fond of such  things. I got very hungry. Again and again the mice rushed through the  straw, and I, heavily, helplessly, in my unpractised way, rushed after  them. At first the elephant laughed heartily at my inexpertness; but  when he saw how hungry and wretched I was, he said--    \"They won't give you any milk, and if they find you don't catch the mice  they will take you away from me. Now you are a nice little cat, and I  don't want to part with you. We must try and arrange something.\"    Then the great thought of my life came to me.    \"You walked on the other cat,\" I said.    \"What?\" he trumpeted in a voice of thunder.    \"I beg your pardon,\" I said hastily; \"I didn't mean to hurt your  feelings\"--and, indeed, I could not have imagined that an elephant would  have been so thin-skinned \"but a great idea has come to me. Why  shouldn't you walk on mice--not too hard, but just so that I could eat  them afterwards?\"    \"Well,\" said the elephant, showing his long tusks in a smile, \"you are  not very handsome, and you are not very brisk; but you certainly have  brains, my dear.\"    He dropped his great foot as he spoke. When he lifted it, there lay a  mouse. I had an excellent supper; and before the week's end I heard the  keeper say, \"This cat has certainly done the trick. She has kept the  mice down. We must keep her.\"    They have kept me. They even go so far as to allow me to moisten my mice  with milk.    There is no moral to this story, except that you should do as you are  told, and learn everything you can while you are young. It is true that  I get on very well without having done so, but then you may not have my  good luck. It is not every cat who can get an elephant to catch her mice  for her.          A Silly Question      \"HOW do you come to be white, when all your brothers are tabby, my  dear?\" Dolly asked her kitten. As she spoke, she took it away from the  ball it was playing with, and held it up and looked in its face as Alice  did with the Red Queen.    \"I'll tell you, if you'll keep it a secret, and not hold me so tight,\"  the kitten answered.    Dolly was not surprised to hear the kitten speak, for she had read her  fairy books, as all good children should, and she knew that all  creatures answer if one only speaks to them properly. So she held the  kitten more comfortably and the tale began.    \"You must know, my dear Dolly,\" the kitten began--and Dolly thought it  dreadfully familiar--\"you must know that when we were very small we all  set out to seek our fortunes.\"    \"Why,\" interrupted Dolly, \"you were all born and brought up in our barn!  I used to see you every day.\"    \"Quite so,\" said the kitten; \"we sought our fortune every night, and it  turned out to be mice, mostly. Well, one night I was seeking mine, when  I came to a hole in the door that I had never noticed before. I crept  through it, and found myself in a beautiful large room. It smelt  delicious. There was cheese there, and fish, and cream, and mice, and  milk. It was the most lovely room you can think of.\"    \"There's no such room----\" began Dolly.    \"Did I say there was?\" asked the kitten. \"I only said I found myself  there. Well, I stayed there some time. It was the happiest hour of my  life. But, as I was washing my face after one of the most delicious  herring's heads you ever tasted, I noticed that on nails all round the  room were hung skins--and they were cat skins,\" it added slowly. \"Well  may you tremble!\"    Dolly hadn't trembled. She had only shaken the kitten to make it speak  faster.    \"Well, I stood there rooted to the ground with horror; and then came a  sort of horrible scramble-rush, and a barking and squeaking, and a  terrible monster stood before me. It was something like a dog and  something like a broom, something like being thrown out of the larder by  cook--I can't describe it. It caught me up, and in less than a moment  it had hung my tabby skin on a nail behind the door.    \"I crept out of that lovely fairyland a cat without a skin. And that's  how I came to be white.\"    \"I don't quite see----\" began Dolly.    \"No? Why, what would your mother do if some one took off your dress, and  hung it on a nail where she could not get it?\"    \"Buy me another, I suppose.\"    \"Exactly. But when my mother took me to the cat-skin shop, they were,  unfortunately, quite out of tabby dresses in my size, so I had to have a  white one.\"    \"I don't believe a word of it,\" said Dolly.    \"No? Well, I'm sure it's as good a story as you could expect in answer  to such a silly question.\"    \"But you were always----\"    \"Oh, well!\" said the kitten, showing its claws, \"if you know more about  it than I do, of course there's no more to be said. Perhaps you could  tell me why your hair is brown?\"    \"I was born so, I believe,\" said Dolly gently.    The kitten put its nose in the air.    \"You've got no imagination,\" it said.    \"But, Kitty, really and truly, without pretending, you _were_ born  white, you know.\"    \"If you know all about it, why did you ask me? At any rate, you can't  expect me to remember whether I was born white or not. I was too young  to notice such things.\"    \"Now you are in fun,\" said poor Dolly, bewildered.    The kitten bristled with indignation.    \"What! you really don't believe me? I'll never speak to you again,\" it  said. And it never has.            The Selfish Pussy      \"YES,\" said the tortoiseshell cat to the grey one, as she thoughtfully  washed her left ear, \"I have lived in a great many families. You see,  it's not every trade that deserves to have a cat about the place. My  first master was a shoemaker, and I lived with him happily enough, until  one morning in winter, when I found the wicked man sewing strips of--let  me whisper--_cat's fur_ on a pair of lady's slippers!    \"I mewed as I saw it, and he, thinking I wanted milk, put down his work  to get me some, for he was fond enough of me. I drank the milk, and then  I ran away. I could not live with such a man.    \"My next home was in a garret, with a half-starved musician who made  violins. A violin is a musical instrument that miauls when you touch it  just as we cats do, and it was amusing to live with a man who could make  things with voices like my own. He was very poor, and often had not  enough to eat, but he always got me my cat's-meat; and when there was no  fire on, he nursed me to keep me warm. But one day I learned, from the  talk of one of his friends (a man as lean as himself) who came to see  him, that the strings of the violins were taken from the bodies of dead  cats. No wonder the voices were like my brothers' voices, since they  were stolen from my brothers' bodies. He might take my own voice some  day.    \"So next day, after the cat's-meat man had called, I walked quietly out,  and never saw that bad violin-maker again.    \"I was picked up in the street by a child, who took me home to her  mother's house.

The dividers of the builder or shipwright illustrated here are of French  origin and may be valued as much for their cultural significance as for  their technical importance. (Smithsonian photo 49792-G.)]    By 1900, the carpenter's tool chest, fully stocked and fit for the  finest craftsman, contained 90 or more tools. Specialization is readily  apparent; the change in, and achievement of, the ultimate design of a  specific tool is not so easily pinpointed. Only by comparing  illustrations and surviving examples can such an evolution be  appreciated and in the process, whether pondering the metamorphosis of a  plane, a brace and bit, or an auger, the various stages of change  encountered coincide with the rise of modern industrial society.    [Illustration: Figure 14.--1688: FRONTISPIECE FROM JOHN BROWN, _The  Description and Use of the Carpenter's Rule_, London, 1688. (Library of  Congress.)]      Configuration    Hand tools are often neglected in the search for the pleasing objects of  the past. Considered too utilitarian, their decorative appeal--the  mellow patina of the wood plane or the delicately tapered legs of a pair  of dividers--often goes unnoticed. Surprisingly modern in design, the  ancient carpenter's or cabinetmaker's tool has a vitality of line that  can, without reference to technical significance, make it an object of  considerable grace and beauty. The hand tool is frequently a lively and  decorative symbol of a society at a given time--a symbol, which,  according to the judges at London's Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851,  gives \"indications of the peculiar condition and habits of the people  whence they come, of their social and industrial wants and aims, as well  as their natural or acquired advantages.\"[8] The hand tool, therefore,  should be considered both as an object of appealing shape and a document  illustrative of society and its progress.

(Smithsonian photo 49792-B.)]    On first sight, it is the conformation rather than any facet of its  technical or social significance that strikes the eye; perhaps the most  decorative of tools are early dividers and calipers which, prior to  their standardization, existed in seemingly endless variety. The great  dividers used by the shipbuilder and architect for scribing and  measuring timbers not only indicate building techniques (accession  61.548) but also document 17th-and early 18th-century decorative  metalwork, as seen in figure 13.
