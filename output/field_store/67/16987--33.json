The reed or fourth cavity of the calf's stomach retains its  power of coagulating milk even after it has been taken from the animal.  We have a familiar instance of its operation in the formation of curds  and whey.    The first and second cavities (_a_ and _b_) are placed parallel (or on a  level) with each other; and the oesophagus (_e_) opens, almost  equally, into them both. On each side of the termination of the  oesophagus there is a muscular ridge projecting, so that the two  together form a sort of groove or channel, which opens almost equally  into the second and third cavities (_b_ and _c_).    [As there has not been, as far as I am aware, any appropriate name given  to this very remarkable part of the stomach of ruminants, I here take  the liberty of suggesting the term _Gastro-duct_, by which epithet this  muscular channel will be designated in the following pages.]    [Illustration: View of Gastro-duct, after Flourens.    _a._ A portion of the oesophagus cut open, showing the internal folds  of the mucous membrane.    _b._ The opening of the oesophagus into the paunch.    _c, c._ The gastro-duct.    _d, d._ Muscular fibres passing completely round the edge of the  gastro-duct, and forming a sort of sphincter.    _e._ The opening from the gastro-duct into the third cavity.]    All these parts, namely, the oesophagus, the gastro-duct, and the  first three cavities, not only communicate with each other, but they  communicate by one common point, and that point is the gastro-duct. At  the extremity of the third cavity, opposite to that at which the  gastro-duct enters it, is an aperture which communicates immediately  with the fourth cavity (_d_).    Such is a very brief description of the complicated stomach of the Ox  Tribe. In what manner the food passes through this curious arrangement  of cavities is a problem which has engaged the attention of naturalists  from a very early period. A host of great men might be cited who have  failed to solve it. The French physiologist, M. Flourens, by his recent  experiments, has done more than any or all of his predecessors to give  clearness and precision to this intricate subject.    The following is an abstract of the most important of his experiments:--    A sheep having been fed on fresh trefoil, was killed and opened  immediately,--that is, before the process of rumination had commenced.  He (M. Flourens) found the greatest part of this herb (easily recognised  by its leaves, which were still almost entire,) in the paunch; but he  also found a certain portion (_une partie notable_) of those leaves (in  the same unmasticated state) in the honeycomb. In the other two  cavities, (the many-plies and the reed,) there was absolutely none.    M. Flourens repeated this experiment a great many times, with herbs of  various kinds, and the result was constantly the same: from which it  appears, that herbaceous food, on its first deglutition, enters into the  honeycomb, as well as into the paunch; the proportion, however, being  considerably greater into the paunch than into the honeycomb. It appears  equally certain that, in the first swallowing, this kind of food _only_  enters into the first two cavities, and never passes into the many-plies  or the reed.    Having ascertained this fact with respect to _herbs_, he instituted a  similar series of experiments, in which the animals were fed upon  various kinds of _grain_,--rye, barley, wheat, oats, &c. The animals  were killed and examined, as in the former experiments, immediately  after being fed. He found the greater part of the grain unmasticated  (_tout entier_) in the paunch; but, as in the case of the herbs, he also  found a certain portion, in the same unmasticated state, in the  honeycomb. Neither the many-plies nor the reed contained a single grain.  He repeated these experiments many times, and always with the same  result.    He then tried the effect of carrots cut into pieces, from half an inch  to an inch in length; and in order that the animals might not chew them,  he passed them into the pharynx by means of a tube. In one of these  sheep he found all the morsels in the paunch; but, in the other two,  some of the morsels were in the honeycomb, and some in the paunch. In  all the three cases, there was none either in the many-plies or in the  reed.    He then proceeded to ascertain the effect of substances previously  comminuted. He caused a certain quantity of carrots to be reduced to a  kind of mash, with which he fed two sheep, and opened them immediately  afterwards. He found the greatest part of this mash in the paunch and in  the honeycomb; but he likewise found a certain portion in the many-plies  and in the reed.    His next experiments were made upon plain fluids. It is the opinion of  the generality of authors on this subject that fluids pass immediately  and _entirely_, along the gastro-duct, into the third and fourth  cavities. But, according to the experiments of M. Flourens, this is not  the case. He found, by making artificial openings (_anus artificiel_) in  the stomachs of various sheep, that, as the animals drank, the fluid  came directly out at the opening, in whatever cavity it might have been  made.    It is clear, then, that fluids pass, in part, into the first and second  cavities, and, in part, into the third and fourth; and they pass as  directly into the former as into the latter.    The following is the result of some experiments which M. Flourens made  respecting the formation of the pellets.    In the first place, after the animal has swallowed a certain quantity of  food the first time, successive pellets are formed of this food, which  remount singly to the mouth; secondly, there is a particular apparatus,  which forms these pellets; and, thirdly, this apparatus consists of the  two closed apertures (_ouvertures fermees_) of the many-plies, and of  the oesophagus. Thus, the first two cavities, in contracting, push the  aliments which they contain between the edges of the gastro-duct; and  the gastro-duct, contracting in its turn, draws together the two  openings of the many-plies and oesophagus; and these two openings,  _closed_ at this moment of their action, seize a portion of the food,  detach it, and form it into a pellet.    The chief utility of rumination, as applicable to all the  animals in which it takes place, and the final purpose of this  wonderfully-complicated function in the animal economy, are still  imperfectly known; what has been already suggested on these points is  quite unsatisfactory. Perrault and others supposed that it contributed  to the security of those animals, which are at once voracious and timid,  by showing the necessity of their remaining long employed in chewing in  an open pasture; but the Indian buffalo ruminates, although it does not  fly even from the lion; and the wild goat dwells in Alpine countries,  which are inaccessible to beasts of prey.    Whatever may be our ignorance of the cause or the object of rumination,  it is certain that the nature of the food has a considerable influence  in increasing or diminishing the necessity for the performance of that  function. Thus, dry food requires to be entirely subjected to a second  mastication, before it can pass into the many-plies and reed; whilst a  great portion of that which is moist and succulent passes readily into  those cavities, on its first descent into the stomach.    It has already been shown by the illustration, (p. 4,) that the paunch  is the largest of the four cavities; but this is not the case with the  stomach of the young calf, which, while it continues to suck, does not  ruminate; in this case the _reed_, which is the true digestive cavity,  is actually larger than the other three taken together.    When the calf begins to feed upon solid food, then it begins to  ruminate; and as the quantity of solid food is increased, so does the  size of the paunch increase, until it attains its full dimensions. In  this latter case, the _paunch_ has become considerably larger than the  other three cavities taken together.    A curious modification of an organ to adjust itself to the altered  condition of the animal is beautifully shown in the instance now under  consideration, the nature of which will be easily understood by a  reference to the following diagrams, giving the exact relative  proportions of the different cavities of the stomach to each other in  the young calf and in the full-grown cow.         [I am informed by Professor Symonds, of the Royal Veterinary       College, that the two following sketches should be placed in       the page so as to be viewed with the oesophagus to the right,       and the pylorus to the left, instead of being, as they now are,       at the top and the bottom; but as the present object is only to       show the relative sizes of the different cavities, the error is       not of much consequence.]    The letters refer to the same parts in each figure: _a_, the paunch;  _b_, the honeycomb bag; _c_, the many-plies; _d_, the reed.    [Illustration: Outline of the Stomach of a Calf about a fortnight old.]    [Illustration: Outline of the Stomach of a full-grown Cow.]    [These engravings, illustrative of the comparative sizes of the  different stomachal cavities, are copied from original drawings taken  from preparations of the stomachs which I made expressly for this  purpose.]    In all herbivorous animals, and especially those of the ruminating kind,  the alimentary canal is of an enormous length; measuring in a full grown  ox, as much as sixty yards. The paunch, in such an animal, will hold  from fifteen to eighteen gallons.    Blumenbach observes, that the process of rumination supposes a power of  voluntary motion in the oesophagus; and, indeed, the influence of the  will throughout the whole process is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],[0,"Austral English (#3)"],[1,"equal accent.    Care has been taken to remember that this is an Australasian  <i>English</i> and not a Maori Dictionary; therefore to exclude  words that have not passed into the speech of the settlers.  But in New Zealand Maori is much more widely used in the matter  of vocabulary than the speech of the aborigines is in  Australia, or at any rate in the more settled parts of  Australia; and the Maori is in a purer form.  Though some words  and names have been ridiculously corrupted, the language of  those who dwell in the bush in New Zealand can hardly be called  <i>Pigeon English</i>, and that is the right name for the  \"lingo\" used in Queensland and Western Australia, which, only  partly represented in this book, is indeed a falling away from  the language of Bacon and Shakspeare.        IV.  LAW OF HOBSON-JOBSON.      In many places in the Dictionary, I find I have used the  expression \"the law of Hobson-Jobson.\"  The name is an  adaptation from the expression used by Col. Yule and  Mr. Burnell as a name for their interesting Dictionary of  Anglo-Indian words.  The law is well recognised, though it has  lacked the name, such as I now venture to give it.  When a word  comes from a foreign language, those who use it, not  understanding it properly, give a twist to the word or to some  part of it from the hospitable desire to make the word at home  in its new quarters, no regard, however, being paid to the  sense.  The most familiar instance in English is  <i>crayfish</i> from the French <i>ecrevisse</i>, though it is  well known that a crayfish is not a fish at all.  Amongst the  Mohammedans in India there is a festival at which the names of  \"Hassan\" and \"Hosein\" are frequently called out by devotees.  Tommy Atkins, to whom the names were naught, converted them  into \"Hobson, Jobson.\"  That the practice of so altering words  is not limited to the English is shown by two perhaps not very  familiar instances in French, where \"Aunt Sally\" has become  <i>ane sale</i>, \"a dirty donkey,\" and \"bowsprit\" has become  <i>beau pre</i>, though quite unconnected with \"a beautiful  meadow.\"  The name \"Pigeon English\" is itself a good example.  It has no connection with pigeon, the bird, but is an  Oriental's attempt to pronounce the word \"business.\"  It  hardly, however, seems necessary to alter the spelling to  \"pidjin.\"    It may be thought by some precisians that all Australasian  English is a corruption of the language.  So too is  Anglo-Indian, and, <i>pace</i> Mr. Brander Matthews, there are  such things as Americanisms, which were not part of the  Elizabethan heritage, though it is perfectly true that many of  the American phrases most railed at are pure old English,  preserved in the States, though obsolete in Modern England; for  the Americans, as Lowell says, \"could not take with them any  better language than that of Shakspeare.\"  When we hear railing  at slang phrases, at Americanisms, some of which are admirably  expressive, at various flowers of colonial speech, and at words  woven into the texture of our speech by those who live far away  from London and from Oxford, and who on the outskirts of the  British Empire are brought into contact with new natural  objects that need new names, we may think for our comfort on  the undoubted fact that the noble and dignified language of the  poets, authors and preachers, grouped around Lewis XIV., sprang  from debased Latin.  For it was not the classical Latin that is  the origin of French, but the language of the soldiers and the  camp-followers who talked slang and picked words up from every  quarter.  English has certainly a richer vocabulary, a finer  variety of words to express delicate distinctions of meaning,  than any language that is or that ever was spoken: and this is  because it has always been hospitable in the reception of new  words.  It is too late a day to close the doors against new  words.  This <i>Austral English Dictionary</i> merely  catalogues and records those which at certain doors have  already come in.        V.  CLASSIFICATION OF THE WORDS.      The Dictionary thus includes the following classes of Words,  Phrases and Usages; viz.--    (1) Old English names of Natural Objects--Birds, Fishes,  Animals, Trees, Plants, etc.--applied (in the first instance by  the early settlers) either to new Australian species of such  objects, or to new objects bearing a real or fancied  resemblance to them--as <i>Robin, Magpie, Herring, Cod, Cat,  Bear, Oak, Beech, Pine, Cedar, Cherry, Spinach, Hops, Pea,  Rose</i>.    (2) English names of objects applied in Australia to others  quite different-as <i>Wattle</i>, a hurdle, applied as the name  of the tree <i>Wattle</i>, from whose twigs the hurdle was most  readily made; <i>Jackass</i>, an animal, used as the name for  the bird <i>Jackass</i>; <i>Cockatoo</i>, a birdname, applied  to a small farmer.    (3) Aboriginal Australian and Maori words which have been  incorporated unchanged in the language, and which still denote  the original object--as <i>Kangaroo, Wombat, Boomerang, Whare,  Pa, Kauri</i>.    (4) Aboriginal Australian and Maori words which have been  similarly adopted, and which have also had their original  meaning extended and applied to other things--as <i>Bunyip,  Corrobbery, Warrigal</i>.    (5) Anglicised corruptions of such words--as <i>Copper-Maori,  Go-ashore, Cock-a-bully, Paddy-melon, Pudding-ball,  Tooky-took</i>.    (6) Fanciful, picturesque, or humorous names given to new  Australasian Natural Objects--as <i>Forty-spot, Lyre-bird,  Parson-bird, and Coach-whip</i> (birds); <i>Wait-a-while</i> (a  tangled thicket); <i>Thousand-jacket, Jimmy Low, Jimmy  Donnelly, and Roger Gough</i> (trees); <i>Axe-breaker,  Cheese-wood, and Raspberry Jam</i> (timbers); <i>Trumpeter,  Schnapper and Sergeant Baker</i> (fishes);  <i>Umbrella-grass</i> and <i>Spaniard</i> (native plants), and  so on.    (7) Words and phrases of quite new coinage, or arising from  quite new objects or orders of things--as <i>Larrikin, Swagman,  Billy, Free-selector, Boundary-rider, Black-tracker,  Back-blocks, Clear-skin, Dummyism, Bushed.</i>    (8) Scientific names arising exclusively from Australasian  necessities, chiefly to denote or describe new Natural Orders,  Genera, or Species confined or chiefly appertaining to  Australia--as <i>Monotreme, Petrogale, Clianthus, Ephthianura,  Dinornis, Eucalypt, Boronia, Ornithorhynchus, Banksia</i>.    (9) Slang (of which the element is comparatively small)--  as <i>Deepsinker, Duck-shoving, Hoot, Slushy, Boss-cockie,  On-the-Wallaby</i>.        VI. QUOTATIONS.    With certain exceptions, this Dictionary is built up, as a  Dictionary should be, on quotations, and these are very  copious.  It may even be thought that their number is too  large.  It is certainly larger, and in some places the  quotations themselves are much longer, than could ever be  expected in a general Dictionary of the English Language.  This  copiousness is, however, the advantage of a special Dictionary.  The intention of the quotations is to furnish evidence that a  word is used as an English word; and many times the quotation  itself furnishes a satisfactory explanation of the meaning.  I  hope, however, I shall not be held responsible for all the  statements in the quotations, even where attention is not drawn  to their incorrectness.  Sundry Australasian uses of words are  given in other dictionaries, as, for instance, in the parts  already issued of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> and in  <i>The Century</i>, but the space that can be allotted to them  in such works is of necessity too small for full explanation.  Efforts have been made to select such quotations as should in  themselves be interesting, picturesque, and illustrative.  In a  few cases they may even be humorous.    Moreover, the endeavour has been constant to obtain quotations  from all parts of the Australasian Colonies--from books that  describe different parts of Australasia, and from newspapers  published far and wide.  I am conscious that in the latter  division Melbourne papers predominate, but this has been due to  the accident that living in Melbourne I see more of the  Melbourne papers, whilst my friends have sent me more  quotations from books and fewer from newspapers.    The quotations, however, are not all explanatory.  Many times  a quotation is given merely to mark the use of a word at a  particular epoch.  Quotations are all carefully dated and  arranged in their historical order, and thus the exact  chronological development of a word has been indicated.  The  practice of the `O.E.D.' has been followed in this respect and  in the matter of quotations generally, though as a rule the  titles of books quoted have been more fully expressed here than  in that Dictionary.  Early quotations have been sought with  care, and a very respectable antiquity, about a century, has  been thus found for some Australasian words.  As far as  possible, the spelling, the stops, the capitals, and the  italics of the original have been preserved.  The result is  often a rich variety of spelling the same word in consecutive  extracts.    The last decade has been a very active time in Australian  science.  A great deal of system has been brought into its  study, and much rearrangement of classification has followed as  the result.  Both among birds and plants new species have been  distinguished and named: and there has been not a little change  in nomenclature.  This Dictionary, it must be remembered, is  chiefly concerned with vernacular names, but for proper  identification, wherever possible, the scientific name is  added.  In some cases, where there has been a recent change in  the latter, both the new and the older names are recorded.        VII.  AUTHORITIES.      The less-known birds, fishes, plants, and trees are in many  cases not illustrated by quotations, but have moved to their  places in the Dictionary from lists of repute. "]]]
