[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2412"],[0,"The Categories (#3)"],[1,"quantities are number and speech; of continuous,  lines, surfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and place.    In the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary at  which they join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives  have no common boundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven  also do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever be  possible in the case of number that there should be a common boundary  among the parts; they are always separate. Number, therefore, is a  discrete quantity.    The same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident: for  it is measured in long and short syllables. I mean here that speech  which is vocal. Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts have  no common boundary. There is no common boundary at which the syllables  join, but each is separate and distinct from the rest.    A line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is possible  to find a common boundary at which its parts join. In the case of the  line, this common boundary is the point; in the case of the plane, it  is the line: for the parts of the plane have also a common boundary.  Similarly you can find a common boundary in the case of the parts of a  solid, namely either a line or a plane.    Space and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past,  present, and future, forms a continuous whole. Space, likewise, is a  continuous quantity; for the parts of a solid occupy a certain space,  and these have a common boundary; it follows that the parts of space  also, which are occupied by the parts of the solid, have the same  common boundary as the parts of the solid. Thus, not only time, but  space also, is a continuous quantity, for its parts have a common  boundary.    Quantities consist either of parts which bear a relative position each  to each, or of parts which do not. The parts of a line bear a relative  position to each other, for each lies somewhere, and it would be  possible to distinguish each, and to state the position of each on the  plane and to explain to what sort of part among the rest each was  contiguous. Similarly the parts of a plane have position, for it could  similarly be stated what was the position of each and what sort of  parts were contiguous. The same is true with regard to the solid and to  space. But it would be impossible to show that the parts of a number had  a relative position each to each, or a particular position, or to state  what parts were contiguous. Nor could this be done in the case of time,  for none of the parts of time has an abiding existence, and that which  does not abide can hardly have position. It would be better to say that  such parts had a relative order, in virtue of one being prior to  another. Similarly with number: in counting, 'one' is prior to 'two',  and 'two' to 'three', and thus the parts of number may be said to  possess a relative order, though it would be impossible to discover any  distinct position for each. This holds good also in the case of speech.  None of its parts has an abiding existence: when once a syllable is  pronounced, it is not possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the  parts do not abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities  consist of parts which have position, and some of those which have not.    Strictly speaking, only the things which I have mentioned belong to the  category of quantity: everything else that is called quantitative is a  quantity in a secondary sense. It is because we have in mind some one  of these quantities, properly so called, that we apply quantitative  terms to other things. We speak of what is white as large, because the  surface over which the white extends is large; we speak of an action or  a process as lengthy, because the time covered is long; these things  cannot in their own right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance,  should any one explain how long an action was, his statement would be  made in terms of the time taken, to the effect that it lasted a year,  or something of that sort. In the same way, he would explain the size  of a white object in terms of surface, for he would state the area  which it covered. Thus the things already mentioned, and these alone,  are in their intrinsic nature quantities; nothing else can claim the  name in its own right, but, if at all, only in a secondary sense.    Quantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities this  is obvious; thus, there is nothing that is the contrary of 'two cubits  long' or of 'three cubits long', or of a surface, or of any such  quantities. A man might, indeed, argue that 'much' was the contrary of  'little', and 'great' of 'small'. But these are not quantitative, but  relative; things are not great or small absolutely, they are so called  rather as the result of an act of comparison. For instance, a mountain  is called small, a grain large, in virtue of the fact that the latter  is greater than others of its kind, the former less. Thus there is a  reference here to an external standard, for if the terms 'great' and  'small' were used absolutely, a mountain would never be called small or  a grain large. Again, we say that there are many people in a village,  and few in Athens, although those in the city are many times as  numerous as those in the village: or we say that a house has many in  it, and a theatre few, though those in the theatre far outnumber those  in the house. The terms 'two cubits long', 'three cubits long', and so  on indicate quantity, the terms 'great' and 'small' indicate relation,  for they have reference to an external standard. It is, therefore,  plain that these are to be classed as relative.    Again, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have no  contraries: for how can there be a contrary of an attribute which is  not to be apprehended in or by itself, but only by reference to  something external? Again, if 'great' and 'small' are contraries, it  will come about that the same subject can admit contrary qualities at  one and the same time, and that things will themselves be contrary to  themselves. For it happens at times that the same thing is both small  and great. For the same thing may be small in comparison with one  thing, and great in comparison with another, so that the same thing  comes to be both small and great at one and the same time, and is of  such a nature as to admit contrary qualities at one and the same  moment. Yet it was agreed, when substance was being discussed, that  nothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same moment. For  though substance is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet no one  is at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at the same time  both white and black. Nor is there anything which is qualified in  contrary ways at one and the same time.    Moreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be contrary  to themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the same  thing is both great and small at the same time, then 'small' or 'great'  is the contrary of itself. But this is impossible. The term 'great',  therefore, is not the contrary of the term 'small', nor 'much' of  'little'. And even though a man should call these terms not relative  but quantitative, they would not have contraries.    It is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears to  admit of a contrary. For men define the term 'above' as the contrary of  'below', when it is the region at the centre they mean by 'below'; and  this is so, because nothing is farther from the extremities of the  universe than the region at the centre. Indeed, it seems that in  defining contraries of every kind men have recourse to a spatial  metaphor, for they say that those things are contraries which, within  the same class, are separated by the greatest possible distance.    Quantity does not, it appears, admit of variation of degree. One thing  cannot be two cubits long in a greater degree than another. Similarly  with regard to number: what is 'three' is not more truly three than  what is 'five' is five; nor is one set of three more truly three than  another set. Again, one period of time is not said to be more truly  time than another. Nor is there any other kind of quantity, of all that  have been mentioned, with regard to which variation of degree can be  predicated. The category of quantity, therefore, does not admit of  variation of degree.    The most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality  are predicated of it. Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be  equal or unequal. For instance, one solid is said to be equal or  unequal to another; number, too, and time can have these terms applied  to them, indeed can all those kinds of quantity that have been  mentioned.    That which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be termed  equal or unequal to anything else. One particular disposition or one  particular quality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with  another in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of  similarity. Thus it is the distinctive mark of quantity that it can be  called equal and unequal.        Section 2      Part 7    Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of  something else or related to something else, are explained by reference  to that other thing. For instance, the word 'superior' is explained by  reference to something else, for it is superiority over something else  that is meant. Similarly, the expression 'double' has this external  reference, for it is the double of something else that is meant. So it  is with everything else of this kind. There are, moreover, other  relatives, e.g. habit, disposition, perception, knowledge, and  attitude. The significance of all these is explained by a reference to  something else and in no other way.

His pious and incessant teachings did not, however, prove wholly  satisfactory in their results, especially as shown in the career of his  son Increase, or \"Cressy.\"    No age appeared to be too young for these remarkable exhibitions of  religious feeling. Phebe Bartlett was barely four years old when she  passed through her amazing ordeal of conversion, a painful example of  religious precocity. The \"pious and ingenious Jane Turell\" could relate  many stories out of the Scriptures before she was two years old, and was  set upon a table \"to show off,\" in quite the modern fashion. \"Before she  was four years old she could say the greater part of the Assembly's  Catechism, many of the Psalms, read distinctly, and make pertinent  remarks on many things she read. She asked many astonishing questions  about divine mysteries.\" It is a truly comic anticlimax in her father's  stilted letters to her to have him end his pious instructions with this  advice: \"And as you love me do not eat green apples.\"    Of the demeanor of children to their parents naught can be said but  praise. Respectful in word and deed, every letter, every record shows  that the young Puritans truly honored their fathers and mothers. It were  well for them to thus obey the law of God, for by the law of the land  high-handed disobedience of parents was punishable by death. I do not  find this penalty ever was paid, as it was under the sway of grim  Calvin, a fact which redounds to the credit both of justice and youth in  colonial days.    It was not strange that Judge Sewall, always finding in natural events  and appearances symbols of spiritual and religious signification, should  find in his children painful types of original sin.         \"Nov. 6, 1692.--Joseph threw a knop of Brass and hit his Sister       Betty on the forehead so as to make it bleed; and upon which, and       for his playing at Prayer-time and eating when Return Thanks, I       whip'd him pretty smartly. When I first went in (call'd by his       Grandmother) he sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind       the head of the Cradle; which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of       Adam's carriage.\"    It was natural, too, that Judge Sewall's children should be timid; they  ran in terror to their father's chamber at the approach of a  thunderstorm; and, living in mysterious witchcraft days, they fled  screaming through the hall, and their mother with them, at the sudden  entrance of a neighbor with a rug over her head.    All youthful Puritans were not as godly as the young Sewalls. Nathaniel  Mather wrote thus in his diary:         \"When very young I went astray from God and my mind was altogether       taken with vanities and follies: such as the remembrance of them       doth greatly abase my soul within me. Of the manifold sins which       then I was guilty of, none so sticks upon me as that, being very       young, I was _whitling_ on the Sabbath-day; and for fear of being       seen, I did it behind the _door_. A great _reproach_ of God! a       specimen of that _atheism_ I brought into the world with me!\"    It is satisfactory to add that this young prig of a Mather died when  nineteen years of age. Except in Jonathan Edwards's \"Narratives of  Surprising Conversions,\" no more painful examples of the Puritanical  religious teaching of the young can be found than the account given in  the _Magnalia_ of various young souls in whom the love of God was  remarkably budding, especially this same unwholesome Nathaniel Mather.  His diary redounded in dismal groans and self-abasement: he wrote out in  detail his covenants with God. He laid out his minute rules and  directions in his various religious duties. He lived in prayer thrice a  day, and \"did not slubber over his prayers with hasty amputations, but  wrestled in them for a good part of an hour.\" He prayed in his sleep. He  fasted. He made long lists of sins, long catalogues of things forbidden,  \"and then fell a-stoning them.\" He \"chewed much on excellent sermons.\"  He not only read the Bible, but \"obliged himself to fetch a note and  prayer out of each verse,\" as he read. In spite of all these  preparations for a joyous hope and faith, he lived in the deepest  despair; was full of blasphemous imaginations, horrible conceptions of  God, was dejected, self-loathing, and wretched. Indeed, as Lowell said,  soul-saving was to such a Christian the dreariest, not the cheerfullest  of businesses.    That the welfare, if not the pleasure, of their children lay very close  to the hearts of the Pilgrims, we cannot doubt. Governor Bradford left  an account of the motives for the emigration from Holland to the new  world, and in a few sentences therein he gives one of the deepest  reasons of all--the intense yearning for the true well-being of the  children; we can read between the lines the stern and silent love of  those noble men, love seldom expressed but ever present, and the rigid  sense of duty, duty to be fulfilled as well as exacted. Bradford wrote  thus of the Pilgrims:         \"As necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they were forced to       be such, not only to their servants, but in a sorte, to their       dearest children; the which, as it did not a little wound ye tender       harts of many a loving father and mother, so it produced likewise       sundrie sad and sorrowful effects. For many of their children, that       were of best dispositions and gracious inclinations, haveing lernde       to bear ye yoake in their youth, and willing to bear parte of their       parents burden, were, often times so oppressed with their hevie       labours, that though their minds were free and willing, yet their       bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same, and become decreped in       their early youth; the vigor of nature being consumed in ye very       budd as it were. But that which was more lamentable and of all       sorrowes most heavie to be borne, was, that many of their children,       by these occasions, and ye great licentiousness of youth in ye       countrie, and ye manifold temptations of the place, were drawn away       by evill examples into extravagante and dangerous courses, getting       ye raines off their neks and departing from their parents. Some       became souldiers, others took upon them for viages by sea, and       other some worse courses, tending to disolutenes and the danger of       their soules, to ye great greef of their parents and dishonor of       God. So that they saw their posteritie would be in danger to       degenerate and be corrupted.\"    Though Judge Sewall could control and restrain his children, his power  waxed weak over his backsliding and pleasure-seeking grandchildren, and  they annoyed him sorely. Sam Hirst, the son of poor timid Betty, lived  with his grandfather for a time, and on April 1st, 1719, the Judge  wrote:         \"In the morning I dehorted Sam Hirst and Grindall Rawson from       playing Idle tricks because 'twas first of April: They were the       greatest fools that did so. N. E. Men came hither to avoid       anniversary days, the keeping of them such as the 25th of Decr. How       displeasing must it be to God the giver of our Time to keep       anniversary days to play the fool with ourselves and others.\"    Ten years earlier the Judge had written to the Boston schoolmaster,  begging him to \"insinuate into the Scholars the Defiling and Provoking  nature of such a Foolish Practice\" as playing tricks on April first.    Sam was but a sad losel, and vexed him in other and more serious  matters. On March 15th, 1725, the Judge wrote:         \"Sam Hirst got up betime in the morning, and took Ben Swett with       him and went into the Comon to play Wicket. Went before anybody was       up, left the door open: Sam came not to prayer at which I was much       displeased.\"    Two days later he writes thus peremptorily of his grandson:         \"Did the like again, but took not Ben with him. I told him he could       not lodge here practicing thus. So he log'd elsewhere.\"    Though Boston boys played \"wicket\" on Boston Common, I fancy the young  Puritans had, as a rule, few games, and were allowed few amusements.  They apparently brought over some English pastimes with them, for in  1657 it was found necessary to pass this law in Boston:         \"Forasmuch as sundry complaints are made that several persons have       received hurt by boys and young men playing at football in the       streets, these therefore are to enjoin that none be found at that       game in any of the streets, lanes or enclosures of this town under       the penalty of twenty shillings for every such offence.\"    One needless piece of cruelty which was exercised toward boys by Puritan  lawgivers is shown by one of the enjoined duties of the tithingman. He  was ordered to keep all boys from swimming in the water. I do not doubt  that the boys swam, since each tithingman had ten families under his  charge; but of course they could not swim as often nor as long as they  wished. From the brother sport of winter, skating, they were not  debarred; and they went on thin ice, and fell through and were drowned,  just as country boys are nowadays. Judge Sewall wrote on November 30th,  1696:         \"Many scholars go in the afternoon to Scate on Fresh Pond. Wm.       Maxwell and John Eyre fall in, are drowned.\"    In the _New England Weekly Journal_ of January 15th, 1728, we read:         \"On Monday last Two Young Persons who were Brothers, viz Mr. George       and Nathan Howell diverting themselves by Skating at the bottom of       the Common, the Ice breaking under them they were both drowned;\"    and in the same journal of two weeks later date we find record of  another death by drowning.         \"A young man, viz, Mr. Comfort Foster, skating on the ice from       Squantum Point to Dorchester, fell into the "]]]
