Blue rippling waters were to meet  the ocean-bound prows. Music from the Cruiser \"Des Moines\" (come to see  us out) was to blow fainter and fainter in the distance as they cheered  us out of the Dvina River for home.    Now the troops are hurrying off the transport. They are just facing the  strange, terrible campaign faintly outlined. It is now our duty to  faithfully tell the detailed story of it--\"The History of the American  North Russian Expedition,\" to try to do justice in this short volume to  the gripping story of the American soldiers \"Campaigning in North  Russia, 1918-1919.\"    The American North Russian Expeditionary Force consisted of the 339th  Infantry, which had been known at Camp Custer as \"Detroit's Own,\" one  battalion of the 310th Engineers, the 337th Ambulance Company, and the  337th Field Hospital Company. The force was under the command of Col.  George E. Stewart, 339th Infantry, who was a veteran of the Philippines  and of Alaska. The force numbered in all, with the replacements who came  later, about five thousand five hundred men.    These units had been detached from the 85th Division, the Custer  Division, while it was enroute to France, and had been assembled in  southern England, there re-outfitted for the climate and warfare of the  North of Russia. On August the 25th, the American forces embarked at  Newcastle-on-Tyne in three British troopships, the \"Somali,\" the  \"Tydeus\" and the \"Nagoya\" and set sail for Archangel, Russia. A fourth  transport, the \"Czar,\" carried Italian troops who travelled as far as  the Murmansk with our convoy.    The voyage up the North Sea and across the Arctic Ocean, zig-zagging day  and night for fear of the submarines, rounding the North Cape far toward  the pole where the summer sun at midnight scarcely set below the  northwestern horizon, was uneventful save for the occasional alarm of a  floating mine and for the dreadful outbreak of Spanish \"flu\" on board  the ships. On board one of the ships the supply of yeast ran out and  breadless days stared the soldiers in the face till a resourceful army  cook cudgelled up recollections of seeing his mother use drainings from  the potato kettle in making her bread. Then he put the lightening once  more into the dough. And the boys will remember also the frigid breezes  of the Arctic that made them wish for their overcoats which by order had  been packed in their barrack bags, stowed deep down in the hold of the  ships. And this suffering from the cold as they crossed the Arctic  circle was a foretaste of what they were to be up against in the long  months to come in North Russia.    We had thought to touch the Murmansk coast on our way to Archangel, but  as we zig-zagged through the white-capped Arctic waves we picked up a  wireless from the authorities in command at Archangel which ordered the  American troopships to hasten on at full speed. The handful of American  sailors from the \"Olympia,\" the crippled category men from England and  the little battalion of French troops, which had boldly driven the Red  Guards from Archangel and pursued them up the Dvina and up the  Archangel-Vologda Railway, were threatened with extermination. The Reds  had gathered forces and turned savagely upon them.    So we sped up into the White Sea and into the winding channels of the  broad Dvina. For miles and miles we passed along the shores dotted with  fishing villages and with great lumber camps. The distant domes of the  cathedrals in Archangel came nearer and nearer. At last the water front  of that great lumber port of old Peter the Great lay before us strange  and picturesque. We dropped anchor at 10:00 a. m. on the fourth day of  September, 1918. The anchor chains ran out with a cautious rattle. We  swung on the swift current of the Dvina, studied the shoreline and the  skyline of the city of Archangel, saw the Allied cruisers, bulldogs of  the sea, and turned our eyes southward toward the boundless pine forest  where our American and Allied forces were somewhere beset by the  Bolsheviki, or we turned our eyes northward and westward whence we had  come and wondered what the folks back home would say to hear of our  fighting in North Russia.

At Stoney Castle camp in England, inquiry by the Americans had elicited  statement from the British authorities that each ship would be well  supplied with medicines and hospital equipment for the long voyage into  the frigid Arctic. But it happened that none were put on the boat and  all that the medical officers had to use were three or four boxes of  medical supplies that they had clung to all the way from Camp Custer.    Before half the perilous and tedious voyage was completed, the dreaded  Spanish influenza broke out on three of the ships. On the \"Somali,\"  which is typical of the three ships, every available bed was full on the  fifth day out at sea. Congestion was so bad that men with a temperature  of only 101 or 102 degrees were not put into the hospital but lay in  their hammocks or on the decks. To make matters worse, on the eighth day  out all the \"flu\" medicines were exhausted.    It was a frantic medical detachment that paced the decks of those three  ships for two days and nights after the ships arrived in the harbor of  Archangel while preparations were being made for the improvisation of  hospitals.    On the 6th of September they debarked in the rain at Bakaritza. About  thirty men could be accommodated in the old Russian Red Cross Hospital,  such as it was, dirt and all. The remainder were temporarily put into  old barracks. What \"flu\"-weakened soldier will ever forget those double  decked pine board beds, sans mattress, sans linen, sans pillows? If  lucky, a man had two blankets. He could not take off his clothes. Death  stalked gauntly through and many a man died with his boots on in bed.  The glory of dying in France to lie under a field of poppies had come to  this drear mystery of dying in Russia under a dread disease in a strange  and unlovely place. Nearly a hundred of them died and the wonder is that  more men did not die. What stamina and courage the American soldier  showed, to recover in those first dreadful weeks!    No attempt is made to fasten blame for this upon the American medical  officers, nor upon the British for that matter. Many a soldier, though,  was wont to wish that Major Longley had not himself been nearly dead of  the disease when the ships arrived. To the credit of Adjutant Kiley,  Captains Hall, Kinyon, Martin and Greenleaf and Lieutenants Lowenstein  and Danzinger and the enlisted medical men, let it be said that they  performed prodigies of labor trying to serve the sick men who were  crowded into the five hastily improvised hospitals.    The big American Red Cross Hospital, receiving hospital at the base, was  started at Archangel November 22nd by Captain Pyle under orders of Major  Longley. The latter had been striving for quite a while to start a  separate receiving hospital for American wounded, but had been blocked  by the British medical authorities in Archangel. They declared that it  was not feasible as the Americans had no equipment, supplies or medical  personnel.    However, the officer in charge of the American Red Cross force in  Archangel offered to supply the needed things, either by purchasing them  from the stores of British medical supplies in Archangel or by sending  back to England for them. It is said that the repeated letters of Major  Longley to SOS in England somehow were always tangled in the British and  American red tape, in going through military channels.    At last Major Longley took the bull by the horns and accepted the aid of  the Red Cross and selected and trained a personnel to run the hospital  from among the officers and men who had been wounded and were recovered  or partially recovered and were not fit for further heavy duty on the  fighting line. He had the valuable assistance also of the two American  Red Cross nurses, Miss Foerster and Miss Gosling, the former later being  one of five American women who, for services in the World War, were  awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal.    On September 10th, we opened the first Red Cross Hospital which was also  used in connection with the Russian Red Cross Hospital and was served by  Russian Red Cross nurses. Captain Hall and Lieutenant Kiley were in  charge of the hospital.    A few days later an infirmary was opened for the machine gunners and  Company \"C\" of the engineers at Solombola.    A good story goes in connection with this piece of history of the little  Red Cross hospital on Troitsky near Olga barracks. There had been rumor  and more or less open declaration of the British medical authorities  that the Americans would not be permitted to start a hospital of their  own in Archangel. The Russian sisters who owned the building were  interested observers as to the outcome of this clash in authority. It  was settled one morning about ten o'clock in a spectacular manner much  to the satisfaction of the Americans and Russians. Captain Wynn of the  American Red Cross came to the assistance of Captain Hall, supplying the  American flag and helping raise it over the building and dared the  British to take it down. Then he supplied the hospital with beds and  linen and other supplies and comfort bags for the men, dishes, etc. This  little hospital is a haven of rest that appears in the dreams today of  many a doughboy who went through those dismal days of the first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#3)"],[1,"mine, the awful happenings of earthquake and  storm, the triumphs of invention and discovery, the epochs of man's  development in godliness and the long periods of his dwindling in  unbelief--all the occurrences that make history--are chronicled  throughout Christendom by reference to the year before or after the  birth of Jesus Christ.    His earthly life covered a period of thirty-three years; and of these  but three were spent by Him as an acknowledged Teacher openly engaged in  the activities of public ministry. He was brought to a violent death  before He had attained what we now regard as the age of manhood's prime.  As an individual He was personally known to but few; and His fame as a  world character became general only after His death.    Brief account of some of His words and works has been preserved to us;  and this record, fragmentary and incomplete though it be, is rightly  esteemed as the world's greatest treasure. The earliest and most  extended history of His mortal existence is embodied within the  compilation of scriptures known as the New Testament; indeed but little  is said of Him by secular historians of His time. Few and short as are  the allusions to Him made by non-scriptural writers in the period  immediately following that of His ministry, enough is found to  corroborate the sacred record as to the actuality and period of Christ's  earthly existence.    No adequate biography of Jesus as Boy and Man has been or can be  written, for the sufficing reason that a fulness of data is lacking.  Nevertheless, man never lived of whom more has been said and sung, none  to whom is devoted a greater proportion of the world's literature. He is  extolled by Christian, Mohammedan and Jew, by skeptic and infidel, by  the world's greatest poets, philosophers, statesmen, scientists, and  historian. Even the profane sinner in the foul, sacrilege of his oath  acclaims the divine supremacy of Him whose name he desecrates.    The purpose of the present treatise is that of considering the life and  mission of Jesus _as_ the Christ. In this undertaking we are to be  guided by the light of both ancient and modern scriptures; and, thus  led, we shall discover, even in the early stages of our course, that the  word of God as revealed in latter days is effective in illuming and  making plain the Holy Writ of ancient times, and this, in many matters  of the profoundest imports.[3]    Instead of beginning our study with the earthly birth of the Holy Babe  of Bethlehem, we shall consider the part taken by the Firstborn Son of  God in the primeval councils of heaven, at the time when He was chosen  and ordained to be the Savior of the unborn race of mortals, the  Redeemer of a world then in its formative stages of development. We are  to study Him as the Creator of the world, as the Word of Power, through  whom the purposes of the Eternal Father were realized in the preparation  of the earth for the abode of His myriad spirit-children during the  appointed period of their mortal probation. Jesus Christ was and is  Jehovah, the God of Adam and of Noah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and  Jacob, the God of Israel, the God at whose instance the prophets of the  ages have spoken, the God of all nations, and He who shall yet reign on  earth as King of kings and Lord of lords.    His wondrous yet natural birth, His immaculate life in the flesh, and  His voluntary death as a consecrated sacrifice for the sins of mankind,  shall claim our reverent attention; as shall also His redeeming service  in the world of disembodied spirits; His literal resurrection from  bodily death to immortality; His several appearings to men and His  continued ministry as the Resurrected Lord on both continents; the  reestablishment of His Church through His personal presence and that of  the Eternal Father in the latter days; and His coming to His temple in  the current dispensation. All these developments in the ministration of  the Christ are already of the past. Our proposed course of investigation  will lead yet onward, into the future concerning which the word of  divine revelation is of record. We shall consider the conditions  incident to the Lord's return in power and glory to inaugurate the  dominion of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, and to usher in the  predicted Millennium of peace and righteousness. And yet beyond we shall  follow Him, through the post-Millennial conflict between the powers of  heaven and the forces of hell, to the completion of His victory over  Satan, sin, and death, when He shall present the glorified earth and its  sanctified hosts, spotless and celestialized, unto the Father.    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints affirms her possession  of divine authority for the use of the sacred name, Jesus Christ, as the  essential part of her distinctive designation. In view of this exalted  claim, it is pertinent to inquire as to what special or particular  message the Church has to give to the world concerning the Redeemer and  Savior of the race, and as to what she has to say in justification of  her solemn affirmation, or in vindication of her exclusive name and  title. As we proceed with our study, we shall find that among the  specific teachings of the Church respecting the Christ are these:    (1) The unity and continuity of His mission in all ages--this of  necessity involving the verity of His preexistence and foreordination.  (2) The fact of His antemortal Godship. (3) The actuality of His birth  in the flesh as the natural issue of divine and mortal parentage. (4)  The reality of His death and physical resurrection, as a result of which  the power of death shall be eventually overcome. (5) The literalness of  the atonement wrought by Him, including the absolute requirement of  individual compliance with the laws and ordinances of His gospel as the  means by which salvation may be attained. (6) The restoration of His  Priesthood and the reestablishment of His Church in the current age,  which is verily the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. (7) The  certainty of His return to earth in the near future, with power and  great glory, to reign in Person and bodily presence as Lord and King.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] As to the year of Christ's birth, see chapter 8.    [2] See chapter 6.    [3] The Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and  the Pearl of Great Price constitute the standard works of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These will be cited alike as  Scriptures in the following pages, for such they are.          CHAPTER 2.    PREEXISTENCE AND FOREORDINATION OF THE CHRIST.      We affirm, on the authority of Holy Scripture, that the Being who is  known among men as Jesus of Nazareth, and by all who acknowledge His  Godhood as Jesus the Christ, existed with the Father prior to birth in  the flesh; and that in the preexistent state He was chosen and ordained  to be the one and only Savior and Redeemer of the human race.  Foreordination implies and comprizes preexistence as an essential  condition; therefore scriptures bearing upon the one are germane to the  other; and consequently in this presentation no segregation of evidence  as applying specifically to the preexistence of Christ or to His  foreordination will be attempted.    John the Revelator beheld in vision some of the scenes that had been  enacted in the spirit-world before the beginning of human history. He  witnessed strife and contention between loyalty and rebellion, with the  hosts defending the former led by Michael the archangel, and the  rebellious forces captained by Satan, who is also called the devil, the  serpent, and the dragon. We read: \"And there was war in heaven; Michael  and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his  angels.\"[4]    In this struggle between unembodied hosts the forces were unequally  divided; Satan drew to his standard only a third part of the children of  God, who are symbolized as the \"stars of heaven\";[5] the majority either  fought with Michael, or at least refrained from active opposition, thus  accomplishing the purpose of their \"first estate\"; while the angels who  arrayed themselves on the side of Satan \"kept not their first  estate\",[6] and therefore rendered themselves ineligible for the  glorious possibilities of an advanced condition or \"second estate\".[7]  The victory was with Michael and his angels; and Satan or Lucifer,  theretofore a \"son of the morning\", was cast out of heaven, yea \"he was  cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him\".[8] The  prophet Isaiah, to whom these momentous occurrences had been revealed  about eight centuries prior to the time of John's writings, laments with  inspired pathos the fall of so great a one; and specifies selfish  ambition as the occasion: \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer,  son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst  weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascent  into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit  also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I  will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most  High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the  pit.\"[9]    Justification for citing these scriptures in connection with our present  consideration will be found in the cause of the great contention--the  conditions that led to this war in heaven. It is plain from the words of  Isaiah that Lucifer, already of exalted rank, sought to aggrandize  himself without regard to the rights and agency of others. The matter is  set forth, in words that none may misapprehend, in a revelation given to  Moses and repeated through the first prophet of the present  dispensation: \"And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That  Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is  the same which was from the beginning, and"]]]
