[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#3)"],[1,"were several tenants: now the person who occupied the  rooms next to those in which Mademoiselle de Guerchi lived was a  shopkeeper's widow called Rapally, who was owner of one of the  thirty-two houses which then occupied the bridge Saint-Michel. They had  all been constructed at the owner's cost, in return for a lease for  ever. The widow Rapally's avowed age was forty, but those who knew her  longest added another ten years to that: so, to avoid error, let us say  she was forty-five. She was a solid little body, rather stouter than was  necessary for beauty; her hair was black, her complexion brown, her eyes  prominent and always moving; lively, active, and if one once yielded to  her whims, exacting beyond measure; but until then buxom and soft, and  inclined to pet and spoil whoever, for the moment, had arrested her  volatile fancy. Just as we make her acquaintance this happy individual  was a certain Maitre Quennebert, a notary of Saint Denis, and the comedy  played between him and the widow was an exact counterpart of the one  going on in the rooms of Mademoiselle de Guerchi, except that the roles  were inverted; for while the lady was as much in love as the Duc de  Vitry, the answering devotion professed by the notary was as insincere  as the disinterested attachment to her lover displayed by the whilom  maid of honour.    Maitre Quennebert was still young and of attractive appearance, but his  business affairs were in a bad way. For long he had been pretending not  to understand the marked advances of the widow, and he treated her with  a reserve and respect she would fain have dispensed with, and which  sometimes made her doubt of his love. But it was impossible for her as a  woman to complain, so she was forced to accept with resignation the  persistent and unwelcome consideration with which he surrounded her.  Maitre Quennebert was a man of common sense and much experience, and had  formed a scheme which he was prevented from carrying out by an obstacle  which he had no power to remove. He wanted, therefore, to gain time, for  he knew that the day he gave the susceptible widow a legal right over  him he would lose his independence. A lover to whose prayers the adored  one remains deaf too long is apt to draw back in discouragement, but a  woman whose part is restricted to awaiting those prayers, and answering  with a yes or no, necessarily learns patience. Maitre Quennebert would  therefore have felt no anxiety as to the effect of his dilatoriness on  the widow, were it not for the existence of a distant cousin of the late  Monsieur Rapally, who was also paying court to her, and that with a  warmth much greater than had hitherto been displayed by himself. This  fact, in view of the state of the notary's affairs, forced him at last  to display more energy. To make up lost ground and to outdistance his  rival once more, he now began to dazzle the widow with fine phrases and  delight her with compliments; but to tell the truth all this trouble was  superfluous; he was beloved, and with one fond look he might have won  pardon for far greater neglect.    An hour before the treasurer's arrival there had been a knock at the  door of the old house, and Maitre Quennebert, curled, pomaded, and  prepared for conquest, had presented himself at the widow's. She  received him with a more languishing air than usual, and shot such  arrows at him froth her eyes that to escape a fatal wound he pretended  to give way by degrees to deep sadness. The widow, becoming alarmed,  asked with tenderness--    \"What ails you this evening?\"    He rose, feeling he had nothing to fear from his rival, and, being  master of the field, might henceforth advance or recede as seemed best  for his interests.    \"What ails me?\" he repeated, with a deep sigh. \"I might deceive you,  might give you a misleading answer, but to you I cannot lie. I am in  great trouble, and how to get out of it I don't know.\"    \"But tell me what it is,\" said the widow, standing up in her turn.    Maitre Quennebert took three long strides, which brought him to the far  end of the room, and asked--    \"Why do you want to know? You can't help me. My trouble is of a kind a  man does not generally confide to women.\"    \"What is it? An affair of honour?    \"Yes.\"    \"Good God! You are going to fight!\" she exclaimed, trying to seize him  by the arm. \"You are going to fight!\"    \"Ah! if it were nothing worse than that!\" said Quennebert, pacing up and  down the room: \"but you need not be alarmed; it is only a money trouble.  I lent a large sum, a few months ago, to a friend, but the knave has run  away and left me in the lurch. It was trust money, and must be replaced  within three days. But where am I to get two thousand francs?\"    \"Yes, that is a large sum, and not easy to raise at such short notice.\"    \"I shall be obliged to have recourse to some Jew, who will drain me dry.  But I must save my good name at all costs.\"    Madame Rapally gazed at him in consternation. Maitre Quennebert,  divining her thought, hastened to add--    \"I have just one-third of what is needed.\"    \"Only one-third?\"    \"With great care, and by scraping together all I possess, I can make up  eight hundred livres. But may I be damned in the next world, or punished  as a swindler in this, and one's as bad as the other to me, if I can  raise one farthing more.\"    \"But suppose someone should lend you the twelve hundred francs, what  then?\"    \"Pardieu! I should accept them,\" cried the notary as if he had not the  least suspicion whom she could mean. \"Do you happen to know anyone, my  dear Madame Rapally?\"    The widow nodded affirmatively, at the same time giving him a passionate  glance.    \"Tell me quick the name of this delightful person, and I shall go to him  to-morrow morning. You don't know what a service you are rendering me.  And I was so near not telling you of the fix I was in, lest you should  torment yourself uselessly. Tell me his name.\"    \"Can you not guess it?\"    \"How should I guess it?\"    \"Think well. Does no one occur to you?\"    \"No, no one,\" said Quennebert, with the utmost innocence.    \"Have you no friends?\"    \"One or two.\"    \"Would they not be glad to help you?\"    \"They might. But I have mentioned the matter to no one.\"    \"To no one?\"    \"Except you.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, Madame Rapally--I hope I don't understand you; it's not possible;  you would not humiliate me. Come, come, it's a riddle, and I am too  stupid to solve it. I give it up. Don't tantalise me any longer; tell me  the name.\"    The widow, somewhat abashed by this exhibition of delicacy on the part  of Maitre Quennebert, blushed, cast down her eyes, and did not venture  to speak.    As the silence lasted some time, it occurred to the notary that he had  been perhaps too hasty in his supposition, and he began to cast round  for the best means of retrieving his blunder.    \"You do not speak,\" he said; \"I see it was all a joke.\"    \"No,\" said the widow at last in a timid voice, \"it was no joke; I was  quite in earnest. But the way you take things is not very encouraging.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Pray, do you imagine that I can go on while you glare at me with that  angry frown puckering your forehead, as if you had someone before you  who had tried to insult you?\"    A sweet smile chased the frown from the notary's brow. Encouraged by the  suspension of hostilities, Madame Rapally with sudden boldness  approached him, and, pressing one of his hands in both her own,  whispered--    \"It is I who am going to lend you the money.\"    He repulsed her gently, but with an air of great dignity, and said--    \"Madame, I thank you, but I cannot accept.\"    \"Why can't you?\"    At this he began to walk round and round the room, while the widow, who  stood in the middle, turned as upon a pivot, keeping him always in view.  This circus-ring performance lasted some minutes before Quennebert stood  still and said--    \"I cannot be angry with you, Madame Rapally, I know your offer was made  out of the kindness of your heart,--but I must repeat that it is  impossible for me to accept it.\"    \"There you go again! I don't understand you at all! Why can't you  accept? What harm would it do?\"    \"If there were no other reason, because people might suspect that I  confided my difficulties to you in the hope of help.\"    \"And supposing you did, what then? People speak hoping to be understood.  You wouldn't have minded asking anyone else.\"    \"So you really think I did come in that hope?\"    \"Mon Dieu! I don't think anything at all that you don't want. It was I  who dragged the confidence from you by my questions, I know that very  well. But now that you have told me your secret, how can you hinder me  from sympathising with you, from desiring to aid you? When I learned  your difficulty, ought I to have been amused, and gone into fits of  laughter? What! it's an insult to be in a position to render you a  service! That's a strange kind of delicacy!\"    \"Are you astonished that I should feel so strongly about it?\"    \"Nonsense! Do you still think I meant to offend you? I look on you as  the most honourable man in the world. If anyone were to tell me that he  had seen you commit a base action, I should reply that it was a lie.  Does that satisfy you?\"    \"But suppose they got hold of it in the city, suppose it were reported  that Maitre Quennebert had taken money from Madame de Rapally, would it  be the same as if they said Maitre Quennebert had borrowed twelve  hundred livres from Monsieur Robert or some other business man?\"    \"I don't see what difference it could make.\"    \"But I do.\"    \"What then?\"    \"It's not easy to express, but----\"    \"But you exaggerate both the service and the gratitude you ought to  feel. I think I know why you refuse. You're ashamed to take it as a  gift, aren't you.\"    \"Yes, I am.\"    \"Well, I'm not going to make you a gift. Borrow twelve hundred livres  from me. For how long do you want "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#3)"],[1,"bania, another of the king's brothers, looked upon him affrighted,  clutching to her breast her two younger sons, Ludovico, Count of  Gravina, and Robert, Prince of Morea. Charles, pale-faced, with short  hair and thick beard, was glancing with suspicion first at his dying  uncle and then at Joan and the little Marie, then again at his cousins,  apparently so excited by tumultuous thoughts that he could not stand  still. His feverish uneasiness presented a marked contrast with the  calm, dreamy face of Bertrand d'Artois, who, giving precedence to his  father Charles, approached the queen at the foot of the bed, and so  found himself face to face with Joan. The young man was so absorbed by  the beauty of the princess that he seemed to see nothing else in the  room.    As soon as Joan and Andre, the Princes of Tarentum and Durazzo, the  Counts of Artois, and Queen Sancha had taken their places round the bed  of death, forming a semicircle, as we have just described, the  vice-chancellor passed through the rows of barons, who according to  their rank were following closely after the princes of the blood; and  bowing low before the king, unfolded a parchment sealed with the royal  seal, and read in a solemn voice, amid a profound silence:    \"Robert, by the grace of God King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Count of  Provence, Forcalquier, and Piedmont, Vicar of the Holy Roman Church,  hereby nominates and declares his sole heiress in the kingdom of Sicily  on this side and the other side of the strait, as also in the counties  of Provence, Forcalquier, and Piedmont, and in all his other  territories, Joan, Duchess of Calabria, elder daughter of the excellent  lord Charles, Duke of Calabria, of illustrious memory.    \"Moreover, he nominates and declares the honourable lady Marie, younger  daughter of the late Duke of Calabria, his heiress in the county of Alba  and in the jurisdiction of the valley of Grati and the territory of  Giordano, with all their castles and dependencies; and orders that the  lady thus named receive them in fief direct from the aforesaid duchess  and her heirs; on this condition, however, that if the duchess give and  grant to her illustrious sister or to her assigns the sum of 10,000  ounces of gold by way of compensation, the county and jurisdiction  aforesaid--shall remain in the possession of the duchess and her heirs.    \"Moreover, he wills and commands, for private and secret reasons, that  the aforesaid lady Marie shall contract a marriage with the very  illustrious prince, Louis, reigning King of Hungary. And in case any  impediment should appear to this marriage by reason of the union said to  be already arranged and signed between the King of Hungary and the King  of Bohemia and his daughter, our lord the king commands that the  illustrious lady Marie shall contract a marriage with the elder son of  the mighty lord Don Juan, Duke of Normandy, himself the elder son of the  reigning King of France.\"    At this point Charles of Durazzo gave Marie a singularly meaning look,  which escaped the notice of all present, their attention being absorbed  by the reading of Robert's will. The young girl herself, from the moment  when she first heard her own name, had stood confused and thunderstruck,  with scarlet cheeks, not daring to raise her eyes.    The vice-chancellor continued:    \"Moreover, he has willed and commanded that the counties of Forcalquier  and Provence shall in all perpetuity be united to his kingdom, and shall  form one sole and inseparable dominion, whether or not there be several  sons or daughters or any other reason of any kind for its partition,  seeing that this union is of the utmost importance for the security and  common prosperity of the kingdom and counties aforesaid.    \"Moreover, he has decided and commanded that in case of the death of the  Duchess Joan--which God avert!--without lawful issue of her body, the  most illustrious lord Andre, Duke of Calabria, her husband, shall have  the principality of Salerno, with the title, fruits, revenues, and all  the rights thereof, together with the revenue of 2000 ounces of gold for  maintenance.    \"Moreover, he has decided and ordered that the Queen above all, and also  the venerable father Don Philip of Cabassole, Bishop of Cavaillon,  vice-chancellor of the kingdom of Sicily, and the magnificent lords  Philip of Sanguineto, seneschal of Provence, Godfrey of Marsan, Count of  Squillace, admiral of the kingdom, and Charles of Artois, Count of Aire,  shall be governors, regents, and administrators of the aforesaid lord  Andre and the aforesaid ladies Joan and Marie, until such time as the  duke, the duchess, and the very illustrious lady Marie shall have  attained their twenty-fifth year,\" etc. etc.    When the vice-chancellor had finished reading, the king sat up, and  glancing round upon his fair and numerous family, thus spoke:    \"My children, you have heard my last wishes. I have bidden you all to my  deathbed, that you may see how the glory of the world passes away. Those  whom men name the great ones of the earth have more duties to perform,  and after death more accounts to render: it is in this that their  greatness lies. I have reigned thirty-three years, and God before whom I  am about to appear, God to whom my sighs have often arisen during my  long and painful life, God alone knows the thoughts that rend my heart  in the hour of death. Soon shall I be lying in the tomb, and all that  remains of me in this world will live in the memory of those who pray  for me. But before I leave you for ever, you, oh, you who are twice my  daughters, whom I have loved with a double love, and you my nephews who  have had from me all the care and affection of a father, promise me to  be ever united in heart and in wish, as indeed you are in my love. I  have lived longer than your fathers, I the eldest of all, and thus no  doubt God has wished to tighten the bonds of your affection, to accustom  you to live in one family and to pay honour to one head. I have loved  you all alike, as a father should, without exception or preference. I  have disposed of my throne according to the law of nature and the  inspiration of my conscience: Here are the heirs of the crown of Naples;  you, Joan, and you, Andre, will never forget the love and respect that  are due between husband and wife, and mutually sworn by you at the foot  of the altar; and you, my nephews all; my barons, my officers, render  homage to your lawful sovereigns; Andre of Hungary, Louis of Tarentum,  Charles of Durazzo, remember that you are brothers; woe to him who shall  imitate the perfidy of Cain! May his blood fall upon his own head, and  may he be accursed by Heaven as he is by the mouth of a dying man; and  may the blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit descend  upon that man whose heart is good, when the Lord of mercy shall call to  my soul Himself!\"    The king remained motionless, his arms raised, his eyes fixed on heaven,  his cheeks extraordinarily bright, while the princes, barons, and  officers of the court proffered to Joan and her husband the oath of  fidelity and allegiance. When it was the turn of the Princes of Duras to  advance, Charles disdainfully stalked past Andre, and bending his knee  before the princess, said in a loud voice, as he kissed her hand--    \"To you, my queen, I pay my homage.\"    All looks were turned fearfully towards the dying man, but the good king  no longer heard. Seeing him fall back rigid and motionless, Dona Sancha  burst into sobs, and cried in a voice choked with tears--    \"The king is dead; let us pray for his soul.\"    At the very same moment all the princes hurried from the room, and every  passion hitherto suppressed in the presence of the king now found its  vent like a mighty torrent breaking through its banks.    \"Long live Joan!\" Robert of Cabane, Louis of Tarentum, and Bertrand of  Artois were the first to exclaim, while the prince's tutor, furiously  breaking through the crowd and apostrophising the various members of the  council of regency, cried aloud in varying tones of passion, \"Gentlemen,  you have forgotten the king's wish already; you must cry, 'Long live  Andre!' too;\" then, wedding example to precept, and himself making more  noise than all the barons together, he cried in a voice of thunder--    \"Long live the King of Naples!\"    But there was no echo to his cry, and Charles of Durazzo, measuring the  Dominican with a terrible look, approached the queen, and taking her by  the hand, slid back the curtains of the balcony, from which was seen the  square and the town of Naples. So far as the eye could reach there  stretched an immense crowd, illuminated by streams of light, and  thousands of heads were turned upward towards Castel Nuovo to gather any  news that might be announced. Charles respectfully drawing back and  indicating his fair cousin with his hand, cried out--    \"People of Naples, the King is dead: long live the Queen!\"    \"Long live Joan, Queen of Naples!\" replied the people, with a single  mighty cry that resounded through every quarter of the town.    The events that on this night had followed each other with the rapidity  of a dream had produced so deep an impression on Joan's mind, that,  agitated by a thousand different feelings, she retired to her own rooms,  and shutting herself up in her chamber, gave free vent to her grief. So  long as the conflict of so many ambitions waged about the tomb, the  young queen, refusing every consolation that was offered her, wept  bitterly for the death of her grandfather, who had loved her to the  point of weakness. The king was buried with all solemnity in the church  of Santa Chiara, which he had himself founded and dedicated to the Holy  Sacrament, enriching it with magnificent frescoes by Giotto and other  precious relics, among which is shown still, behind the tribune of the  high altar, two columns of white marble taken from Solomon's"]]]
