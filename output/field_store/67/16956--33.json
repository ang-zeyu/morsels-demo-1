[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#3)"],[1,"f-justice of England,  the Lord Chief-justice of Common Pleas, and the Lord Chief Baron of  Exchequer.\" In a Chapter on _The Witchcraft in Salem, Boston, and  Andover, in New England_, he attributes it, as will be seen in the  course of this article, to the influence of the writings of the Mathers.    In the Preface to the London edition of Cotton Mather's _Memorable  Providences_, written by Richard Baxter, in 1690, he ascribes this same  prominence to the works of the Mathers. While expressing the great value  he attached to writings about Witchcraft, and the importance, in his  view, of that department of literature which relates stories about  diabolical agency, possessions, apparitions, and the like, he says, \"Mr.  Increase Mather hath already published many such histories of things  done in New England; and this great instance published by his son\"--that  is, the account of the Goodwin children--\"cometh with such full  convincing evidence, that he must be a very obdurate Sadducee that will  not believe it. And his two Sermons, adjoined, are excellently fitted to  the subject and this blinded generation, and to the use of us all, that  are not past our warfare with Devils.\" One of the Sermons, which Baxter  commends, is on _The Power and Malice of Devils_, and opens with the  declaration, that \"there is a combination of Devils, which our air is  filled withal:\" the other is on _Witchcraft_. Both are replete with the  most exciting and vehement enforcements of the superstitions of that  age, relating to the Devil and his confederates.    My first position, then, in contravention of that taken by the Reviewer  in the _North American_, is that, by stimulating the Clergy over the  whole country, to collect and circulate all sorts of marvelous and  supposed preternatural occurrences, by giving this direction to the  preaching and literature of the times, these two active, zealous,  learned, and able Divines, Increase and Cotton Mather, considering the  influence they naturally were able to exercise, are, particularly the  latter, justly chargeable with, and may be said to have brought about,  the extraordinary outbreaks of credulous fanaticism, exhibited in the  cases of the Goodwin family and of \"the afflicted children,\" at Salem  Village. Robert Calef, writing to the Ministers of the country, March  18, 1694, says: \"I having had, not only occasion, but renewed  provocation, to take a view of the mysterious doctrines, which have of  late been so much contested among us, could not meet with any that had  spoken more, or more plainly, the sense of those doctrines\" [_relating  to the Witchcraft_] \"than the Reverend Mr. Cotton Mather, but how  clearly and consistent, either with himself or the truth, I meddle not  now to say, but cannot but suppose his strenuous and zealous asserting  his opinions has been one cause of the dismal convulsions, we have here  lately fallen into.\"--_More Wonders of the Invisible World_, by Robert  Calef, Merchant of Boston, in New England. Edit. London, 1700, p. 33.    The papers that remain, connected with the Witchcraft Examinations and  Trials, at Salem, show the extent to which currency had been given, in  the popular mind, to such marvelous and prodigious things as the Mathers  had been so long endeavoring to collect and circulate; particularly in  the interior, rural settlements. The solemn solitudes of the woods were  filled with ghosts, hobgoblins, spectres, evil spirits, and the  infernal Prince of them all. Every pathway was infested with their  flitting shapes and footprints; and around every hearth-stone,  shuddering circles, drawing closer together as the darkness of night  thickened and their imaginations became more awed and frightened,  listened to tales of diabolical operations: the same effects, in  somewhat different forms, pervaded the seaboard settlements and larger  towns.    Besides such frightful fancies, other most unhappy influences flowed  from the prevalence of the style of literature which the Mathers brought  into vogue. Suspicions and accusations of witchcraft were everywhere  prevalent; any unusual calamity or misadventure; every instance of real  or affected singularity of deportment or behavior--and, in that  condition of perverted and distempered public opinion, there would be  many such--was attributed to the Devil. Every sufferer who had yielded  his mind to what was taught in pulpits or publications, lost sight of  the Divine Hand, and could see nothing but devils in his afflictions.  Poor John Goodwin, whose trials we are presently to consider, while his  children were acting, as the phrase--originating in those days, and  still lingering in the lower forms of vulgar speech--has it, \"like all  possessed,\" broke forth thus: \"I thought of what David said. _2 Samuel_,  xxiv., 14. If he feared so to fall into the hands of men, oh! then to  think of the horrors of our condition, to be in the hands of Devils and  Witches. Thus, our doleful condition moved us to call to our friends to  have pity on us, for God's hand hath touched us. I was ready to say that  no one's affliction was like mine. That my little house, that should be  a little Bethel for God to dwell in, should be made a den for Devils;  that those little Bodies, that should be Temples for the Holy Ghost to  dwell in, should be thus harrassed and abused by the Devil and his  cursed brood.\"--_Late Memorable Providences, relating to Witchcraft and  Possessions._ By Cotton Mather. Edit. London, 1691.    No wonder that the country was full of the terrors and horrors of  diabolical imaginations, when the Devil was kept before the minds of  men, by what they constantly read and heard, from their religious  teachers! In the Sermons of that day, he was the all-absorbing topic of  learning and eloquence. In some of Cotton Mather's, the name, Devil, or  its synonyms, is mentioned ten times as often as that of the benign and  blessed God.    No wonder that alleged witchcrafts were numerous! Drake, in his _History  of Boston_, says there were many cases there, about the year 1688. Only  one of them seems to have attracted the kind of notice requisite to  preserve it from oblivion--that of the four children of John Goodwin,  the eldest, thirteen years of age. The relation of this case, in my  book [_Salem Witchcraft_, i., 454-460] was wholly drawn from the  _Memorable Providences_ and the _Magnalia_.          II.    THE GOODWIN CHILDREN. SOME GENERAL REMARKS UPON THE CRITICISMS OF THE  NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW.      The Reviewer charges me with having wronged Cotton Mather, by  representing that he \"got up\" the whole affair of the Goodwin children.  He places the expression within quotation marks, and repeats it, over  and over again. In the passage to which he refers--p. 366 of the second  volume of my book--I say of Cotton Mather, that he \"repeatedly  endeavored to get up cases of the kind in Boston. There is some ground  for suspicion that he was instrumental in originating the fanaticism in  Salem.\" I am not aware that the expression was used, except in this  passage. But, wherever used, it was designed to convey the meaning given  to it, by both of our great lexicographers. Worcester defines \"_to get  up_, 'to prepare, to make ready--to get up an entertainment;' 'to print  and publish, as a book.'\" Webster defines it, \"to prepare for coming  before the public; to bring forward.\" This is precisely what Mather did,  in the case of the Goodwin children, and what Calef put a stop to his  doing in the case of Margaret Rule.    In 1831, I published a volume entitled _Lectures on Witchcraft,  comprising a history of the Delusion, in Salem, in 1692_. In 1867, I  published _Salem Witchcraft, and an account of Salem Village_; and, in  the Preface, stated that \"the former was prepared under circumstances  which prevented a thorough investigation of the subject. Leisure and  freedom from professional duties have now enabled me to prosecute the  researches necessary to do justice to it. The _Lectures on Witchcraft_  have long been out of print. Although frequently importuned to prepare a  new edition, I was unwilling to issue, again, what I had discovered to  be an inadequate presentation of the subject.\" In the face of this  disclaimer of the authority of the original work, the Reviewer says: \"In  this discussion, we shall treat Mr. Upham's _Lectures_ and History in  the same connection, as the latter is an expansion and defence of the  views presented in the former.\"    I ask every person of candor and fairness, to consider whether it is  just to treat authors in this way? It is but poor encouragement to them  to labor to improve their works, for the first critical journal in the  country to bring discredit upon their efforts, by still laying to their  charge what they have themselves remedied or withdrawn. Yet it is  avowedly done in the article which compels me to this vindication.    The _Lectures_, for instance, printed in 1831, contained the following  sentence, referring to Cotton Mather's agency, in the Goodwin case, in  Boston. \"An instance of witchcraft was brought about, in that place, by  his management.\" So it appeared in a reprint of that volume, in 1832. In  my recent publication, while transferring a long paragraph from the  original work, _I carefully omitted_, from the body of it, the above  sentence, fearing that it might lead to misapprehension. For, although I  hold that the Mathers are pre-eminently answerable for the witchcraft  proceedings in their day, and may be said, justly, to have caused them,  of course I did not mean that, by personal instigation on the spot, they  started every occurrence that ultimately was made to assume such a  character. The Reviewer, with the fact well known to him, that I had  suppressed and discarded this clause, flings it against me, repeatedly.  He further quotes a portion of the paragraph, in the _Lectures_, in  which it occurs, omitting, _without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#3)"],[1,", who wanted a safer form of villainy than open riot, and the  _fellahin_, who wanted a safe market for their produce and easy  taxation, both of which they stood to lose by violence. Many a _fellah_  still believes that the War was a myth created by the authorities to put  prices up. Even Teuton activity failed to stimulate these placid folk,  and the glad tidings preached by the madder type of German missionary  that the Kaiser was the Messiah left them unmoved.    When the Turks came in against us, and the ex-Khedive, safe among his  new-found friends, threw off the mask, the Cairene effendis became  tremendously active. Forgetting how they had disliked Abbas II and  called him a huckstering profligate, they mourned for his deposal by  wearing black ties, especially the students. Some of these enthusiastic  young heroes even went so far as to scatter chlorate of potash crackers  about when their school was visited by poor old Sultan Husein (who was  worth six of his predecessor), and he got quite a shock, which was  flagrantly and noisomely accentuated by asafoetida bomblets.    The ex-Khedive did not share their patriotic grief. He was quite  comfortable while awaiting the downfall of British rule, for, with  shrewd prescience that almost seems inspired, he had taken prudent  measures for his future comfort and luxury before leaving Egypt on his  usual summer tour to Europe. He had mortgaged real estate up to the  hilt, realised on immobile property as far as possible, and diverted his  fluid assets through various channels beyond the reach of his sorrowing  subjects and the Egyptian Government. When an official inventory was  taken in Abdin Palace at the accession of the late Sultan Husein, it was  ascertained that the famous inlaid and begemmed coffee-service, which,  like our Crown jewels, was not supposed to leave the country, had been  sent after the ex-Khedive to his new address--truly a man of parts. I  have often wondered whether his Hunnish friends got him to disgorge by  means of a forced loan or war-bonds, or something of that sort. If so,  they achieved something notable, for he has left behind him, beside his  liabilities, the name of being a difficult man to get money out of.    When the Turco-Teuton blade was actually drawn in Holy War I was down  with enteric, which I had contracted while working in disguise among  seditious circles in the slums of Old Cairo. I just convalesced in time  to join the Intelligence Staff on the Canal the day before Jemal Pasha's  army attacked. His German staff had everything provided for in advance  with their usual thoroughness. From the documents and prisoners that  came through our hands we learnt that the hotel in Cairo where the  victors were to dine after their triumphant entry had actually been  selected, and some enthusiasts went so far as to insist that the menu  had been prepared. If so, they omitted to get the Canal Army on toast,  and for want of this indispensable item the event fell through. All the  same, it was a soldierly enterprise, and if the Senussis had invaded in  force or the population risen behind us, as they hoped would be the  case, the result might have been different.    As it was they put up a very good fight and their arrangements for  getting across the Sinaitic desert were excellent. For the last ten  miles they man-handled their pontoons to the edge of the Canal. These  craft were marvels of lightness and carrying capacity, but, of course,  no protection whatever against even a rifle-bullet, and they had not  fully reckoned with the Franco-British naval flotilla, which proved a  formidable factor.    The morning after the main fight a little Syrian subaltern passed  through my hands. He had been slightly wounded in the leg and still  showed signs of nervous shock, so I made him sit down with a cigarette  while I questioned him. He had been in charge of a pontoon manned by his  party and said that they had got halfway across the Canal in perfect  silence when \"the mouth of hell opened\" and the pontoon was sinking in a  swirl of stricken men amid a hail of projectiles. He and two others swam  to our side of the Canal, where they surrendered to an Indian  detachment.    Our Indian troops on the Canal were naturally a mark for pan-Islamic  propaganda reinforced by Hindu literature of the _Bande Mataram_  type,--a double-barrelled enterprise to bag both the great creeds of  India. The astute propagandists had a pamphlet or two aimed at Sikhism,  which they seemed to consider a nation, as they spoke of their national  aspirations, though an elementary study of the subject might have taught  them that it was a religious and secular movement originally intended to  curb Moslem power in India during the sway of the later Moguls. Anyone  but a Moslem can be a Sikh.    Naturally I was on the _qui vive_ for signs of pan-Islamic activity on  the enemy's side, and I questioned my little Syrian very closely to  ascertain how far the movement was used as a driving force among the  troops engaged against us. He, personally, had rather a grievance on the  subject, for the Indian Moslems who took him had reproached him bitterly  for fighting on the wrong side. \"I fought,\" he said, \"because it was my  duty as an officer of the Ottoman Army. I know that men were invited to  join as for a _jihad_, but we officers did not deceive ourselves. _Par  exemple_, I think myself a better Moslem than any Turk, but what would  you?\" I consoled the little man while concealing my satisfaction at the  feeling displayed against him. An extraordinarily heterogeneous  collection of prisoners came dribbling through my hands directly after  the Turks were repulsed. Most were practically deserters who had been  forcibly enrolled, given a Mauser and a bandoleer, and told to go and  fight for the Holy Places of Islam. As one of the more intelligent  remarked, \"If the Holy Places are really in danger, what are we doing  down this way?\"    They came from all over the Moslem world. There were one or two Russian  pilgrims returning from Mecca to be snapped up by the military  authorities at Damascus railway station when they got out of the pilgrim  train from Medina. There were cabdrivers from Jerusalem, a stranded  pilgrim from China, several Tripolitans who had been roped in on the  Palestine seaboard while trying to get a passage home, a Moor who tried  to embrace my feet when I spoke of the snow-crowned Atlas above Morocco  City (Marraksh) and told him that he would be landed at Tangier in due  course--Inshallah. Of course we released, and repatriated as far as we  could, men who were not Ottoman subjects and had obviously been forced  into service against us. A few days later, when Jemal Pasha's army was  getting into commissariat difficulties out in the Sinaitic desert (for  the Staff had relied on entering Egypt), we began to get the real Turks  among our prisoners.    I was very curious to ascertain if they had been worked up with  pan-Islamic propaganda or carried any of it on them, for there was not  even a Red Crescent Koran on any of the Arabic-speaking prisoners. A  search of their effects revealed a remarkable phase of propaganda. There  was hardly any religious literature except a loose page or two of some  pious work like the \"Traditions of Muhammad,\" but there were quantities  of rather crude (and very lewd) picture-cards portraying soldiers in  Turkish uniform outraging and murdering nude or semi-nude women and  children, while corpses in priestly garb, shattered crucifixes, and  burning churches indicated the creed that was being so harried and gave  the scene a stimulating background. From their appearance I should say  these pictures were originally engraved to commemorate Balkan or  Armenian atrocities, but their possessors, on being closely questioned,  admitted that the impression conveyed to them was of the joyous licence  which was to be theirs among the Frankish civilians after forcing the  Canal. One Kurdish gentleman had among his kit fancy socks, knitted  craftily in several vivid colours, also ornate slippers to wear in his  promised palatial billet at Cairo. There were some odd articles among  the kit of these Turkish prisoners, to wit, a brand-new garden  thermometer, which some wag insisted was for testing the temperature of  the Canal before immersion, and a lavatory towel looted from the Hejaz  railway. Still, nothing was quite so remarkable as a white flag with a  jointed staff in a neat, compact case which had been carried by a German  officer. Among his papers was an indecent post-card not connected, I  think, with propaganda of any sort, as it portrayed a bright-coloured  female of ripe figure and Teutonic aspect, wearing a pair of long  stockings and high-heeled shoes, and bore the legend \"Gruss von  Muenchen.\"    A certain coyness, or possibly an appreciation of their personal value,  kept most of the German officers from actual contact with our line. Only  one reached the Canal bank, and he is there still. The German touch,  however, was much in evidence. There were detailed written orders about  manning the pontoons, not to talk, cough, sneeze, etc., and for each man  to move along the craft as far as feasible and then sit down. They seem  to have relied entirely on surprise, and ignored the chance of its  occurring on the wrong side of the Canal. The emergency rations too  which we found on the earlier batches of prisoners had a distinctly  Teutonic flavour--they were so scientifically nourishing in theory and  so vilely inedible in practice. They were a species of flat gluten cake  rather like a dog-biscuit, but much harder. An amateur explosive expert  of ours tested one of these things by attempting detonation and ignition  before he would let his batch of prisoners retain them, which, to do  their intelligence justice, they were not keen on doing, but offered any  quantity of the stuff for cigarettes.
