Be not cunning;    For they whose faces do belie their hearts    Are witches ere they arrive at twenty years,    Ay, and give the devil suck.      DUCHESS.  This is terrible good counsel.      FERDINAND.  Hypocrisy is woven of a fine small thread,    Subtler than Vulcan's engine:[20] yet, believe 't,    Your darkest actions, nay, your privat'st thoughts,    Will come to light.      CARDINAL.            You may flatter yourself,    And take your own choice; privately be married    Under the eaves of night----      FERDINAND.                  Think 't the best voyage    That e'er you made; like the irregular crab,    Which, though 't goes backward, thinks that it goes right    Because it goes its own way:  but observe,    Such weddings may more properly be said    To be executed than celebrated.      CARDINAL.                        The marriage night    Is the entrance into some prison.      FERDINAND.

Wisdom begins at the end:  remember it.         [Exit.]      DUCHESS.  I think this speech between you both was studied,    It came so roundly off.      FERDINAND.               You are my sister;    This was my father's poniard, do you see?    I 'd be loth to see 't look rusty, 'cause 'twas his.    I would have you give o'er these chargeable revels:    A visor and a mask are whispering-rooms    That were never built for goodness,--fare ye well--    And women like variety of courtship.    What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale    Make a woman believe?  Farewell, lusty widow.         [Exit.]      DUCHESS.  Shall this move me?  If all my royal kindred    Lay in my way unto this marriage,    I 'd make them my low footsteps.  And even now,    Even in this hate, as men in some great battles,    By apprehending danger, have achiev'd    Almost impossible actions (I have heard soldiers say so),    So I through frights and threatenings will assay    This dangerous venture.  Let old wives report    I wink'd and chose a husband.--Cariola,    To thy known secrecy I have given up    More than my life,--my fame.      CARIOLA.                      Both shall be safe;    For I 'll conceal this secret from the world    As warily as those that trade in poison    Keep poison from their children.      DUCHESS.                          Thy protestation    Is ingenious and hearty; I believe it.    Is Antonio come?      CARIOLA.          He attends you.      DUCHESS.                           Good dear soul,    Leave me; but place thyself behind the arras,    Where thou mayst overhear us.  Wish me good speed;    For I am going into a wilderness,    Where I shall find nor path nor friendly clue    To be my guide.         [Cariola goes behind the arras.]         [Enter ANTONIO]                     I sent for you:  sit down;    Take pen and ink, and write:  are you ready?      ANTONIO.                                      Yes.      DUCHESS.  What did I say?      ANTONIO.  That I should write somewhat.      DUCHESS.                                 O, I remember.    After these triumphs and this large expense    It 's fit, like thrifty husbands,[21] we inquire    What 's laid up for to-morrow.      ANTONIO.  So please your beauteous excellence.      DUCHESS.                                        Beauteous!    Indeed, I thank you.  I look young for your sake;    You have ta'en my cares upon you.      ANTONIO.                           I 'll fetch your grace    The particulars of your revenue and expense.      DUCHESS.  O, you are    An upright treasurer:  but you mistook;    For when I said I meant to make inquiry    What 's laid up for to-morrow, I did mean    What 's laid up yonder for me.      ANTONIO.                        Where?      DUCHESS.                                In heaven.    I am making my will (as 'tis fit princes should,    In perfect memory), and, I pray, sir, tell me,    Were not one better make it smiling, thus,    Than in deep groans and terrible ghastly looks,    As if the gifts we parted with procur'd[22]    That violent distraction?      ANTONIO.                   O, much better.      DUCHESS.  If I had a husband now, this care were quit:    But I intend to make you overseer.    What good deed shall we first remember?  Say.      ANTONIO.  Begin with that first good deed began i' the world    After man's creation, the sacrament of marriage;    I 'd have you first provide for a good husband;    Give him all.      DUCHESS.       All!      ANTONIO.             Yes, your excellent self.      DUCHESS.  In a winding-sheet?      ANTONIO.                       In a couple.      DUCHESS.  Saint Winifred, that were a strange will!      ANTONIO.  'Twere stranger[23] if there were no will in you    To marry again.      DUCHESS.         What do you think of marriage?      ANTONIO.  I take 't, as those that deny purgatory,    It locally contains or heaven or hell;    There 's no third place in 't.      DUCHESS.                        How do you affect it?      ANTONIO.  My banishment, feeding my melancholy,    Would often reason thus.      DUCHESS.                  Pray, let 's hear it.      ANTONIO.  Say a man never marry, nor have children,    What takes that from him?  Only the bare name    Of being a father, or the weak delight    To see the little wanton ride a-cock-horse    Upon a painted stick, or hear him chatter    Like a taught starling.      DUCHESS.                 Fie, fie, what 's all this?    One of your eyes is blood-shot; use my ring to 't.    They say 'tis very sovereign.  'Twas my wedding-ring,    And I did vow never to part with it    But to my second husband.      ANTONIO.  You have parted with it now.      DUCHESS.  Yes, to help your eye-sight.      ANTONIO.  You have made me stark blind.      DUCHESS.  How?      ANTONIO.  There is a saucy and ambitious devil    Is dancing in this circle.      DUCHESS.                    Remove him.      ANTONIO.  How?      DUCHESS.  There needs small conjuration, when your finger    May do it:  thus.  Is it fit?         [She puts the ring upon his finger]: he kneels.      ANTONIO.                       What said you?      DUCHESS.                                       Sir,    This goodly roof of yours is too low built;    I cannot stand upright in 't nor discourse,    Without I raise it higher.  Raise yourself;    Or, if you please, my hand to help you:  so.         [Raises him.]      ANTONIO.  Ambition, madam, is a great man's madness,    That is not kept in chains and close-pent rooms,    But in fair lightsome lodgings, and is girt    With the wild noise of prattling visitants,    Which makes it lunatic beyond all cure.    Conceive not I am so stupid but I aim[24]    Whereto your favours tend:  but he 's a fool    That, being a-cold, would thrust his hands i' the fire    To warm them.      DUCHESS.       So, now the ground 's broke,    You may discover what a wealthy mine    I make your lord of.      ANTONIO.              O my unworthiness!      DUCHESS.  You were ill to sell yourself:    This dark'ning of your worth is not like that    Which tradesmen use i' the city; their false lights    Are to rid bad wares off:  and I must tell you,    If you will know where breathes a complete man    (I speak it without flattery), turn your eyes,    And progress through yourself.      ANTONIO.  Were there nor heaven nor hell,    I should be honest:  I have long serv'd virtue,    And ne'er ta'en wages of her.      DUCHESS.                       Now she pays it.    The misery of us that are born great!    We are forc'd to woo, because none dare woo us;    And as a tyrant doubles with his words,    And fearfully equivocates, so we    Are forc'd to express our violent passions    In riddles and in dreams, and leave the path    Of simple virtue, which was never made    To seem the thing it is not.  Go, go brag    You have left me heartless; mine is in your bosom:    I hope 'twill multiply love there.  You do tremble:    Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh,    To fear more than to love me.  Sir, be confident:    What is 't distracts you?  This is flesh and blood, sir;    'Tis not the figure cut in alabaster    Kneels at my husband's tomb.  Awake, awake, man!    I do here put off all vain ceremony,    And only do appear to you a young widow    That claims you for her husband, and, like a widow,    I use but half a blush in 't.      ANTONIO.                       Truth speak for me;    I will remain the constant sanctuary    Of your good name.      DUCHESS.            I thank you, gentle love:    And 'cause you shall not come to me in debt,    Being now my steward, here upon your lips    I sign your Quietus est.[25]  This you should have begg'd now.    I have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus,    As fearful to devour them too soon.      ANTONIO.  But for your brothers?      DUCHESS.                          Do not think of them:    All discord without this circumference    Is only to be pitied, and not fear'd:    Yet, should they know it, time will easily    Scatter the tempest.      ANTONIO.              These words should be mine,    And all the parts you have spoke, if some part of it    Would not have savour'd flattery.      DUCHESS.  Kneel.         [Cariola comes from behind the arras.]      ANTONIO.          Ha!      DUCHESS.  Be not amaz'd; this woman 's of my counsel:    I have heard lawyers say, a contract in a chamber    Per verba [de] presenti[26] is absolute marriage.         [She and ANTONIO kneel.]    Bless, heaven, this sacred gordian[27] which let violence    Never untwine!      ANTONIO.  And may our sweet affections, like the spheres,    Be still in motion!      DUCHESS.             Quickening, and make    The like soft music!      ANTONIO."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],[0,"Impressions of South Africa (#3)"],[1,"swamp the old ones, and take the  control out of Boer hands. They were unfit to do the latter, because  they had neither knowledge nor skill, so that even had private interests  not stood in the way, they would have failed to create a proper  administration. It was the ignorance, as well as the exclusive spirit  of the Transvaal authorities, which made them unwilling to yield any  more than they might be forced to yield to the demand for reform.    The position in which Britain stood needs to be examined from two sides,  its legal right of interference, and the practical considerations which  justified interference in this particular case.    Her legal right rested on three grounds. The first was the Convention of  1884 (printed in the Appendix to this volume), which entitled her to  complain of any infraction of the privileges thereby guaranteed to her  subjects.    The second was the ordinary right, which every State possesses, to  complain, and (if necessary) intervene when its subjects are wronged,  and especially when they suffer any disabilities not imposed upon the  subjects of other States.    The third right was more difficult to formulate. It rested on the fact  that as Britain was the greatest power in South Africa, owning the whole  country south of the Zambesi except the two Dutch Republics (for the  deserts of German Damaraland and the Portuguese East-coast territories  may be practically left out of account), she was interested in  preventing any causes of disturbance within the Transvaal which might  spread beyond its borders, and become sources of trouble either among  natives or among white men. This right was of a vague and indeterminate  nature, and could be legitimately used only when it was plain that the  sources of trouble did really exist and were becoming dangerous.    Was there not also, it may be asked, the suzerainty of Britain, and if  so, did it not justify intervention? I will not discuss the question,  much debated by English lawyers, whether the suzerainty over the  \"Transvaal State,\" mentioned in the preamble to the Convention of 1881,  was preserved over the \"South African Republic\" by the Convention of  1884, not because I have been unable to reach a conclusion on the  subject, but because the point seems to be one of no practical  importance. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is a  suzerainty, it is perfectly clear from an examination of the Conventions  and of the negotiations of 1884 that this suzerainty relates solely to  foreign relations, and has nothing whatever to do with the internal  constitution or government of the Transvaal. The significance of the  term--if it be carried over and read into the Convention of 1884--is  exhausted by the provision in Article IV of that instrument for the  submission of treaties to the British Government. No argument,  accordingly, for any right of interference as regards either the  political arrangements of the Transvaal or the treatment of foreigners  within its borders, can be founded on this real or supposed suzerainty.  This view had been too frequently and too clearly expressed by the  British Government before 1896, to make it possible for any British  official to attempt to put any such construction upon the term; and the  matter might therefore have been suffered to drop, since the right to  veto treaties was explicit, and did not need to be supported by an  appeal to the preamble of 1881. The term, however, though useless to  Britain, was galling to the Transvaal, which suspected that it would be  made a pretext for infringements upon their independence in internal  affairs; and these suspicions were confirmed by the talk of the  Uitlander spokesmen in Johannesburg, who were in the habit of appealing  to Britain as the Suzerain Power. It has played a most unfortunate part  in the whole controversy.    Suzerainty, which is a purely legal, though somewhat vague, conception,  has in many minds become confused with the practical supremacy, or  rather predominance, of Britain in South Africa, which is a totally  different matter. That predominance rests on the fact that Britain  commands the resources of a great empire, while the Dutch republics are  petty communities of ranchmen. But it does not carry any legal rights of  interference, any more than a preponderance of force gives Germany  rights against Holland.    As I have referred to the Convention of 1884, it may be well to observe  that while continuing to believe that, on a review of the facts as they  then stood, the British Government were justified in restoring  self-government to the Transvaal in 1881, they seem to me to have erred  in conceding the Convention of 1884. Though the Rand goldfields had not  then been discovered, Lord Derby ought to have seen that the relations  of the Transvaal to the adjoining British territories would be so close  that a certain measure of British control over its internal  administration might come to be needful. This control, which was indeed  but slight, he surrendered in 1884. But the improvidence of the act does  not in the least diminish the duty of the country which made the  Convention to abide by its terms, or relieve it from the obligation of  making out for any subsequent interference a basis of law and fact which  the opinion of the world might accept as sufficient.    It has not been sufficiently realised in England that although the  Transvaal may properly, in respect of British control over its foreign  relations, be described as a semi-dependent State, Britain was under the  same obligation to treat it with a strict regard to the recognised  principles of international law as if it had been a great power. She had  made treaties with it, and those treaties it was her duty to observe.  Apart from all moral or sentimental considerations, apart from the fact  that Britain had at the Hague Conference been the warm and effective  advocate of peaceful methods of settling disputes between nations, it is  her truest interest to set an example of fairness, legality and  sincerity. No country, not even the greatest, can afford to neglect that  reasonable and enlightened opinion of thoughtful men in other  countries--not to be confounded with the invective and misrepresentation  employed by the press of each nation against the others--which  determines the ultimate judgment of the world, and passes into the  verdict of history.    Did then the grievances of which the British residents in the Transvaal  complained furnish such a basis? These grievances are well known, and  will be found mentioned in chapter XXV. They were real and vexatious. It  is true that some of them affected not so much British residents as the  European shareholders in the great mining companies; true also that the  mining industry (as will be seen from the figures on p. 301) was  expanding and prospering in spite of them. Furthermore, they were  grievances under which, it might be argued, the immigrants had placed  themselves by coming with notice of their existence, and from which they  might escape by taking a train into the Free State or Natal. And they  were grievances which, however annoying, did not render either life or  property unsafe,[1] and did not prevent the Johannesburgers from  enjoying life and acquiring wealth. Nevertheless, they were such as the  British Government was entitled to endeavour to have redressed. Nor  could it be denied that the state of irritation and unrest which  prevailed on the Witwatersrand, the probability that another rising  would take place whenever a chance of success offered, furnished to  Britain, interested as she was in the general peace of the country, a  ground for firm remonstrance and for urging the removal of all  legitimate sources of disaffection, especially as these re-acted on the  whole of South Africa. The British authorities at the Cape seem indeed  to have thought that the unyielding attitude of the Transvaal Government  worked much mischief in the Colony, being taken by the English there as  a defiance to the power and influence of Britain, and so embittering  their minds.    Among the grievances most in men's mouths was the exclusion of the  new-comers from the electoral franchise. It must be clearly  distinguished from the other grievances. It was a purely internal  affair, in which Britain had no right to intermeddle, either under the  Convention of 1884 or under the general right of a state to protect its  subjects. Nothing is clearer than that every state may extend or limit  the suffrage as it pleases. If a British self-governing colony were to  restrict the suffrage to those who had lived fourteen years in the  colony, or a state of the American Union were to do the like, neither  the Home Government in the one case, nor the Federal Government in the  other would have any right to interfere. All therefore that Britain  could do was to call the attention of the South African Republic in a  friendly way to the harm which the restriction of the franchise was  causing, and point out that to enlarge it might remove the risk of a  collision over other matters which did fall within the scope of British  intervention.    We are therefore, on a review of the whole position, led to conclude  that Britain was justified in requiring the Transvaal Government to  redress the grievances (other than the limited suffrage) which were  complained of. Whether she would be justified in proceeding to enforce  by arms compliance with her demand, would of course depend upon several  things, upon the extent to which the existence of the grievances could  be disproved, upon the spirit in which the Transvaal met the demand,  upon the amount of concessions offered or amendment promised. But before  the British Government entered on a course which might end in war, if  the Transvaal should prove intractable, there were some considerations  which it was bound seriously to weigh.    One of these was the"]]]
