Unto pure devotion    Devote thyself: with perfect meditation    Comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--    More certainly because they seek no gain--    Forth from the bands of body, step by step,    To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul    Hath shaken off those tangled oracles    Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar    To high neglect of what's denied or said,    This way or that way, in doctrinal writ.    Troubled no longer by the priestly lore,    Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent    On meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!      Arjuna.    What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,    Confirmed in holy meditation? How    Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he    Like other men?      Krishna.    When one, O Pritha's Son!    Abandoning desires which shake the mind--    Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul,    He hath attained the Yog--that man is such!    In sorrows not dejected, and in joys    Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress    Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms    Of lofty contemplation;--such an one    Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!    He who to none and nowhere overbound    By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good    Neither desponding nor exulting, such    Bears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw    As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe    Under its shield, his five frail senses back    Under the spirit's buckler from the world    Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!    Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense    Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,    The appetites of him who lives beyond    Depart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,    O Son of Kunti! that a governed mind    Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest    Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain    His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit    On Me intent. That man alone is wise    Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one    Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs    Attraction; from attraction grows desire,    Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds    Recklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--    Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,    Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.    But, if one deals with objects of the sense    Not loving and not hating, making them    Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord,    Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity;    And out of that tranquillity shall rise    The end and healing of his earthly pains,    Since the will governed sets the soul at peace.    The soul of the ungoverned is not his,    Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,    How grows serenity? and, wanting that,    Whence shall he hope for happiness?      The mind    That gives itself to follow shows of sense    Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away,    And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives    To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!    Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense--    Only with him who holds his mastery,    Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom    To unenlightened souls shines wakeful day    To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day    Is known for night, thick night of ignorance,    To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!      And like the ocean, day by day receiving        Floods from all lands, which never overflows    Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,        Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;--      So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean        The world of sense pours streams of witchery;    They leave him as they find, without commotion,        Taking their tribute, but remaining sea.      Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh    Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free    From pride, from passion, from the sin of \"Self,\"    Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son!    That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread    When that last step is reached! Live where he will,    Die when he may, such passeth from all 'plaining,    To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER II. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Sankhya-Yog,\"    Or \"The Book of Doctrines.\"            CHAPTER III        Arjuna.    Thou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!    If meditation be a nobler thing    Than action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!    Dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?    Now am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!    Tell me one thing, and tell me certainly;    By what road shall I find the better end?      Krishna.    I told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths    Shown to this world; two schools of wisdom.      First    The Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works    Prescribed[FN#4] by reason; next, the Yog, which bids    Attain by meditation, spiritually:    Yet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act    By shunning action; nay, and none shall come    By mere renouncements unto perfectness.    Nay, and no jot of time, at any time,    Rests any actionless; his nature's law    Compels him, even unwilling, into act;    [For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits    Suppressing all the instruments of flesh,    Yet in his idle heart thinking on them,    Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite:    But he who, with strong body serving mind,    Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work,    Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one    Is honourable. Do thine allotted task!    Work is more excellent than idleness;    The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.    There is a task of holiness to do,    Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not    The faithful soul; such earthly duty do    Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform    Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati--    In the beginning, when all men were made,    And, with mankind, the sacrifice-- \"Do this!    Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply    With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,    Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk    Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;    The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave    The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays    Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats    Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven    No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"      Who eat of food after their sacrifice    Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast    All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.    By food the living live; food comes of rain,    And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,    And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;    Thus action is of Brahma, who is One,    The Only, All-pervading; at all times    Present in sacrifice. He that abstains    To help the rolling wheels of this great world,    Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,    Shameful and vain. Existing for himself,    Self-concentrated, serving self alone,    No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,    Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope    Of help for all the living things of earth    Depends from him.[FN#5] Therefore, thy task prescribed    With spirit unattached gladly perform,    Since in performance of plain duty man    Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone    Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness!    Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind,    Action thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose    The unwise people take; what best men do    The multitude will follow. Look on me,    Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds    I am not bound to any toil, no height    Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,    Yet I act here! and, if I acted not--    Earnest and watchful--those that look to me    For guidance, sinking back to sloth again    Because I slumbered, would decline from good,    And I should break earth's order and commit    Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata!    Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,    So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set    To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;    Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts    Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part    In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.    All things are everywhere by Nature wrought    In interaction of the qualities.    The fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"    And \"That I wrought; \"but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--    A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play    Of visible things within the world of sense,    And how the qualities must qualify,    Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught    Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,    Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.    Those make thou not to stumble, having the light;    But all thy dues discharging, for My sake,    With meditation centred inwardly,    Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene,    Heedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep    My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,    Have quittance from all issue of their acts;    But those who disregard My ordinance,    Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,    Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one    Doth of his kind, following what fits him most:    And lower creatures of their kind; in vain    Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be    The objects of the sense will stir the sense    To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man    Yields not to these, knowing them enemies.    Finally, this is better, that one do    His own task as he may, even though he fail,    Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good.    To die performing duty is no ill;    But who seeks other roads shall wander still.      Arjuna.    Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man    Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one    Pushed him that evil path?      Krishna.    Kama it is!    Passion it is! born of the Darknesses,    Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,    Sinful, and strong is this!--man's enemy!

I'm  not ever going to forget this, so long as I live. Say, watch her shake  hands, Dad! I've taught her, already, to--\"    \"Ed Hazen!\" loudly protested his wife. \"Of all the softies! You haven't  backbone enough for a prune. And if my orders to my own son are going  to be--\"    \"That'll be all, Sade!\" interposed the man stiffly--adding: \"By the  way, I got a queer piece of news to tell you. Come into the kitchen a  minute.\"    Grumbling, rebellious, scowling,--yet unable to resist the lure of a  \"queer piece of news,\" Mrs. Hazen followed her husband indoors, leaving  Dick and his pet to gambol deliriously around the clothes-festooned  yard in celebration of their victory.    \"Listen here, old girl!\" began Hazen the moment the kitchen door was  shut behind them. \"Use some sense, can't you? I gave you the wink, and  you wouldn't catch on. So I had to make the grandstand play. I'm no  more stuck on having a measly she-dog around here than you are. And  we're not going to have her, either. But--\"    \"Then why did you say you were going to? Why did you make a fool of me  before Irene and everything?\" she demanded, wrathful yet bewildered.    \"It's the boy's birthday, isn't it?\" urged Hazen. \"And I'd promised  him, hadn't I? And, last time he had one of those 'turns,' didn't Doc  Colfax say we mustn't let him fret and worry any more'n we could help?  Well, if he had to take that dog back to-day, it'd have broke his  heart. He'd have felt like we were his enemies, and he'd never have  felt the same to us again. And it might have hurt his health too--the  shock and all. So--\"    \"But I tell you,\" she persisted, \"I won't have a dirty little female--\"    \"We aren't going to,\" he assured her. \"Keep your hair on, till I've  finished. Tonight, after Dick's asleep, I'm going to get rid of her.  He'll wake up in the morning and find she's gone; and the door'll be  open. He'll think she's run away. He'll go looking for her, and he'll  keep on hoping to find her. So that'll ease the shock, you see, by  letting him down bit by bit, instead of snatching his pet away from him  violent-like. And he won't hold it up against US, either, as he would  the other way. I can offer a reward for her, too.\"    There was a long and thought-crammed pause. The woman plunged deep into  the silences as her fat brain wrought over the suggestion. Then--    \"Maybe you HAVE got just a few grains of sense, after all, Ed,\"  grudgingly vouchsafed Mrs. Hazen. \"It isn't a bad idea. Only he'll  grieve a lot for her.\"    \"He'll be hoping, though,\" said her husband. \"He'll be hoping all the  while. That always takes the razor-edge off of grieving. Leave it to  me.\"    That was the happiest day Dick Hazen had ever known. And it was the  first actively happy day in all Lass's five months of life.    Boy and dog spent hours in a ramble through the woods. They began  Lass's education--which was planned to include more intricate tricks  than a performing elephant and a troupe of circus dogs could hope to  learn in a lifetime. They became sworn chums. Dick talked to Lass as if  she were human. She amazed the enraptured boy by her cleverness and  spirits. His initiation to the dog-masters' guild was joyous and  complete.    It was a tired and ravenous pair of friends who scampered home at  dinner-time that evening. The pallor was gone from Dick's face. His  cheeks were glowing, and his eyes shone. He ate greedily. His parents  looked covertly at each other. And the self-complacency lines around  Hazen's mouth blurred.    Boy and dog went to bed early, being blissfully sleepy and full of  food--also because another and longer woodland ramble was scheduled for  the morrow.    Timidly Dick asked leave to have Lass sleep on the foot of his cot-bed.  After a second telegraphing of glances, his parents consented. Half an  hour later the playmates were sound asleep, the puppy snuggling deep in  the hollow of her master's arm, her furry head across his thin chest.    It was in this pose that Hazen found them when, late in the evening, he  tiptoed into Dick's cubby-hole room. He gazed down at the slumberous  pair for a space, while he fought and conquered an impulse toward fair  play. Then he stooped to pick up the dog.    Lass, waking at the slight creak of a floorboard, lifted her head. At  sight of the figure leaning above her adored master, the lip curled  back from her white teeth. Far down in her throat a growl was born.  Then she recognized the intruder as the man who had petted her and fed  her that evening. The growl died in her throat, giving place to a  welcoming thump or two of her bushy tail. Dick stirred uneasily.    Patting the puppy lightly on her upraised head, Hazen picked up Lass in  his arms and tiptoed out of the room with her. Mistaking this move for  a form of caress, she tried to lick his face. The man winced.    Downstairs and out into the street Hazen bore his trustful little  burden, halting only to put on his hat, and for a whispered word with  his wife. For nearly a mile he carried the dog. Lass greatly enjoyed  the ride. She was pleasantly tired, and it was nice to be carried thus,  by some one who was so considerate as to save her the bother of walking.    At the edge of the town, Hazen set her on the ground and at once began  to walk rapidly away in the direction of home. He had gone perhaps  fifty yards when Lass was gamboling merrily around his feet. A kick  sent the dismayed and agonized puppy flying through the air like a  whimpering catapult, and landed her against a bank with every atom of  breath knocked out of her. Before she had fairly struck ground,--before  she could look about her,--Hazen had doubled around a corner and had  vanished.    At a run, he made for home, glad the unpleasant job was over. At the  door his wife met him.    \"Well,\" she demanded, \"did you drown her in the canal, the way you  said?\"    \"No,\" he confessed sheepishly, \"I didn't exactly drown her. You see,  she nestled down into my arms so cozy and trusting-like, that I--well,  I fixed it so she'll never show up around here again. Trust me to do a  job thoroughly, if I do it at all. I--\"    A dramatic gesture from Mrs. Hazen's stubby forefinger interrupted him.  He followed the finger's angry point. Close at his side stood Lass,  wagging her tail and staring expectantly up at him.    With her keen power of scent, it had been no exploit at all to track  the man over a mile of unfamiliar ground. Already she had forgiven the  kick or had put it down to accident on his part. And at the end of her  eager chase, she was eager for a word of greeting.    \"I'll be--\" gurgled Hazen, blinking stupidly.    \"I guess you will be,\" conceded his wife. \"If that's the 'thorough' way  you do your jobs at the factory--\"    \"Say,\" he mumbled in a sort of wondering appeal, \"is there any HUMAN  that would like to trust a feller so much as to risk another  ribcracking kick, just for the sake of being where he is? I almost  wish--\"    But the wish was unspoken. Hazen was a true American husband. He feared  his wife more than he loved fairness. And his wife's glare was full  upon him. With a grunt he picked Lass up by the neck, tucked her under  his arm and made off through the dark.    He did not take the road toward the canal, however. Instead he made for  the railroad tracks. He remembered how, as a lad, he had once gotten  rid of a mangy cat, and he resolved to repeat the exploit. It was far  more merciful to the puppy--or at least, to Hazen's conscience,--than  to pitch Lass into the slimy canal with a stone tied to her neck.    A line of freight cars--\"empties\"--was on a siding, a short distance  above the station. Hazen walked along the track, trying the door of  each car he passed. The fourth he came to was unlocked. He slid back  the newly greased side door, thrust Lass into the chilly and black  interior and quickly slid shut the door behind her. Then with the silly  feeling of having committed a crime, he stumbled away through the  darkness at top speed.    A freight car has a myriad uses, beyond the carrying of legitimate  freight. From time immemorial, it has been a favorite repository for  all manner of illicit flotsam and jetsam human or otherwise.    Its popularity with tramps and similar derelicts has long been a theme  for comic paper and vaudeville jest. Though, heaven knows, the inside  of a moving box-car has few jocose features, except in the imagination  of humorous artist or vaudevillian!    But a far more frequent use for such cars has escaped the notice of the  public at large. As any old railroader can testify, trainhands are  forever finding in box-cars every genus and species of stray.    These finds range all the way from cats and dogs and discarded white  rabbits and canaries, to goats. Dozens of babies have been discovered,  wailing and deserted, in box-car recesses; perhaps a hundred miles from  the siding where, furtively, the tiny human bundle was thrust inside  some conveniently unlatched side door.    A freight train offers glittering chances for the disposal of the  Unwanted. More than once a slain man or woman has been sent along the  line, in this grisly but effective fashion, far beyond the reach of  recognition.    Hazen had done nothing original or new in depositing the luckless  collie pup in one of these wheeled receptacles. He was but following an  old-established custom, familiar to many in his line of life. There was  no novelty to it,--except to Lass.    The car was dark and cold and smelly. Lass hated it. She ran to its  door. Here she found a gleam of hope for escape and for return to the  home where every one that day had been so kind to her. Hazen had shut  the door with such vehemence that it had rebounded. The hasp was down,  and so the catch had not done its duty. The door had slid open a few  inches from the impetus of Hazen's shove.    It was not"]]]
