In the comparatively roving and uncertain life which the earlier  inhabitants led, their cattle would sometimes stray and be lost. The  country was at that time overgrown with forests, and the beasts betook  themselves to the recesses of these woods, and became wild and sometimes  ferocious. They, by degrees, grew so numerous as to be dangerous to the  inhabitants of the neighboring districts. One of the chronicles asserts  that many of them harbored in the forests in the neighborhood of London.  Strange stories are told of some of them, and, doubtless, when  irritated, they were fierce and dangerous enough. As, however,  civilization advanced, and the forests became thinned and contracted,  these animals were seen more rarely, and at length almost disappeared. A  few of them, however, are still to be found in the parks of some of the  leading English noblemen, who keep them for ornament and as curiosities.    The color of this wild breed is invariably white, the muzzle being  black; the whole of the inside of the ear, and about one-third of the  outside, from the tips downward, red; horns white, with black tips, very  fine, and bent upward; some of the bulls have a thin, upright mane,  about an inch and a half or two inches long. The beef is finely marbled  and of excellent flavor.    At the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop, and  at the distance of about two hundred yards, make a wheel around and come  boldly up again in a menacing manner; on a sudden they make a full stop  at the distance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of  their surprise; but upon the least motion they all again turn round and  fly off with equal speed, but not to the same distance, forming a  shorter circle; and, again returning with a more threatening aspect than  before, they approach probably within thirty yards, when they again make  another stand, and then fly off; this they do several times, shortening  their distance and advancing nearer and nearer, till they come within  such short distance that most persons think it prudent to leave them.    When the cows calve, they hide their calves for a week or ten days in  some retired situation, and go and suckle them two or three times a day.  If any persons come near the calves they clap their heads close to the  ground to hide themselves--a proof of their native wildness. The dams  allow no one to touch their young without attacking with impetuous  ferocity. When one of the herd happens to be wounded, or has grown weak  and feeble through age or sickness, the rest set on it and gore it to  death.    The breeds of cattle which are now found in Great Britain, are almost as  various as the soil of the different districts or the fancies of the  breeders. They have, however, been very conveniently classed according  to the comparative size of the horns; the _long-horns_, originally from  Lancashire, and established through most of the midland counties; the  _short-horns_, generally cultivated in the northern counties and in  Lincolnshire, and many of them found in every part of the kingdom where  the farmer pays much attention to his dairy, or where a large supply of  milk is desired; and the _middle-horns_, a distinct and valuable breed,  inhabiting, principally, the north of Devon, the east of Sussex,  Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire; and of diminished bulk and with  somewhat different character, the cattle of the Scottish and Welsh  mountains. The Alderney, with its _crumpled horn_, is found on the  southern coast; while the polled, or _hornless_, cattle prevail in  Suffolk, Norfolk, and Galloway, whence they were first derived.    These leading breeds, however, have been intermingled in every possible  way. They are found pure only in their native districts, or on the  estate of some wealthy and spirited individuals. Each county has its own  mongrel breed, often difficult to be described, and not always to be  traced--neglected enough, yet suited to the soil and the climate; and  among small farmers, maintaining their station, in spite of attempts at  improvements by the intermixture or the substitution of foreign  varieties.    Much dispute has arisen as to the original breed of British cattle. The  battle has been sharply fought between the advocates of the middle and  of the long-horns. The short-horns and the polls are out of the lists;  the latter, although it has existed in certain districts from time  immemorial, being probably an accidental variety. The weight of  argument appears at present to rest with the middle horns; the  long-horns being evidently of Irish extraction.    [Illustration: THE WELL-FED BEASTS.]    Great Britain has shared the fate of other nations, and oftener than  they been overrun and subjugated by invaders. As the natives retreated  they carried with them some portion of their property, consisting, in  the remote and early times, principally of cattle. They drove along with  them as many as they could, when they retired to the fortresses of North  Devon and Cornwall, or the mountainous region of Wales, or when they  took refuge in the retirement of East Sussex; and there, retaining all  their prejudices, manners, and customs, were jealous of the preservation  of that which reminded them of their native country before it yielded to  a foreign yoke.    In this way was preserved the ancient breed of British cattle.  Difference of climate produced some change, particularly in their bulk.  The rich pasturage of Sussex fattened the ox into its superior size and  weight. The plentiful, but not so luxuriant, herbage of the north of  Devon produced a smaller and more active animal; while the privations of  Wales lessened the bulk and thickened the hide of the Welsh Stock. As  for Scotland, it set its invaders at defiance; or its inhabitants  retreated for a while, and soon turned again on their pursuers. They  were proud of their country, and of their cattle, their choicest  possession; and there, also, the cattle were preserved, unmixed and  undegenerated.    Thence it has resulted, that in Devon, in Sussex, in Wales, and in  Scotland, the cattle have been the same from time immemorial; while in  all the eastern coasts and through every district of England, the breed  of cattle degenerated, or lost its original character; it consisted of  animals brought from all the neighboring, and some remote districts,  mingled in every possible variety, yet conforming to the soil and the  climate.    Careful observations will establish the fact, that the cattle in  Devonshire, Sussex, Wales, and Scotland are essentially the same. They  are middle horned; not extraordinary milkers, and remarkable for the  quality rather than the quantity of their milk; active at work, and with  an unequalled aptitude to fatten. They have all the characters of the  same breed, changed by soil, climate, and time, yet little changed by  man. The color, even, may be almost traced, namely: the red of the  Devon, the Sussex, and the Hereford; and where only the black are now  found, the recollection of the red prevails.    As this volume is intended especially for the farmers of our own  country, it is deemed unnecessary in this connection to present any  thing additional under the present head, except the names of the  prominent species of British cattle. These are, commencing with the  middle horns, the North Devon, the Hereford, the Sussex, the Welsh (with  the varieties of the Pembrokeshire, the Glamorganshire, the Radnor  black, the Anglesea and some others); and the Scotch with its chief  varieties, the West Highlanders, the North Highlanders, the North  Eastern, the Fife, the Ayrshire, and the Galloways.    As to the long horns, which came originally from Craven in Yorkshire, it  may be remarked that this breed has been rapidly disappearing of late,  and has everywhere given place to better kinds. Of this species there  are--or perhaps were--two leading classes, the Lancashire and the  Leicestershire improved.    Of the short horns, the leading breeds are the Dutch, the Holderness,  the Teeswater, the Yorkshire, the Durham, the Northumberland, and some  others.      AMERICAN CATTLE.    The breeds of cattle which stock the farms of the United States are all  derived from Europe, and, with few exceptions, from Great Britain. The  highest breeds at the present time are of comparatively recent origin,  since the great improvements in breeding were only commenced at about  the period of the American Revolution. The old importations made by the  early settlers, must consequently have been from comparatively inferior  grades.    In some sections of the Union, and more particularly in New England, the  primitive stock is thought to have undergone considerable improvement;  whilst in many parts of the Middle, and especially of the Southern  States, a greater or less depreciation has ensued. The prevailing stock  in the Eastern States is believed to be derived from the North Devons,  most of the excellent marks and qualities of which they possess. For  this reason they are very highly esteemed, and have been frequently  called the American Devon. The most valuable working oxen are chiefly of  this breed, which also contributes so largely to the best displays of  beef found in the markets of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. By  means of this domestic stock, and the importations still extensively  made of selections from the short horns, and others of the finest  European breeds, the cattle, not only of New England, but of other  sections, are rapidly improving, especially in the Middle and Western  States.    A brief sketch of the principal breeds of American cattle, as well as of  the grades or common stock of the country, will be of service to the  farmer in making an intelligent selection with reference to the special  object of pursuit--whether it be the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#3)"],[1,"history, criticising  the present status and outlining the development which has to set in for  the future, if a haphazard zigzag movement is not to destroy this great  agency for human welfare by transforming it into a source of  superstition and bodily danger.          PART I    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY          II    THE AIM OF PSYCHOLOGY      The only safe basis of psychotherapy is a thorough psychological  knowledge of the human personality. Yet such a claim has no value until  it is entirely clear what is meant by psychological knowledge. We can  know man in many ways. Not every study of man's inner life is psychology  and the careless mixing of different ways of dealing with man's inner  life is largely responsible for the vagueness which characterizes the  popular literature of psychotherapy. It is not enough to say that a  statement is true or not true. It may be true under one aspect and  entirely meaningless under another. For instance, a minister's  discussion of man's energies may be full of deep truth and may be  inspiring; and yet it may not contain the slightest contribution to a  really psychological knowledge of those energies, and would mislead  entirely the physician were he to base his treatment of human energies  on such a religious interpretation.    Can we not look from different standpoints even on any part of the  outer world? I see before me the ocean with its excited waves splashing  against the rocks and shore, I see the boats tossed on the stormy sea  and I am fascinated by the new and ever new impulses of the tumultuous  waves. The whole appears to me like one gigantic energy, like one great  emotional expression, and I feel deeply how I understand this beautiful  scenery in appreciating its unity and its meaning. Yet would I ever  think that it is the only way to understand this turmoil of the waters  before me? I know there is no unity and no emotion in the excited sea;  each wave is composed of hundreds of thousands of single drops of water,  and each drop composed of billions of atoms, and every movement results  from mechanical laws under the influence of the pressing water and air.  There is hydrogen and there is oxygen, and there is chloride of sodium,  and the dark blue color is nothing but the reflection of billions of  ether vibrations. But have I really to choose between two statements  concerning the waves, one of which is valuable and the other not? On the  contrary, both have fundamental value. If I take the attitude of  appreciation, it would be absurd to say that this wave is composed of  chemical elements which I do not see; and if I take the attitude of  physical explanation, it would be equally absurd to deny that such  elements are all of which the wave is made. From the one standpoint, the  ocean is really excited; from the other standpoint, the molecules are  moving according to the laws of hydrodynamics. If I want to understand  the meaning of this scene every reminiscence of physics will lead me  astray; if I want to calculate the movement of my boat, physics alone  can help me.    As long as we deal with outer nature, there is hardly a fear of  confusing the various attitudes; but it becomes by far more complex when  we deal with man and his inner life. We might abstract entirely from  aesthetic appreciation or from moral valuation, we might take man just as  an object of knowledge; and yet what we know about him may be entirely  different in accordance with our special attitude. Each kind of  knowledge may be entirely true, and yet true only from the particular  standpoint. Let us consider two extremes. If I meet a friend and we  enter into a talk, I try to understand his thoughts and to share his  views. I agree or disagree with him; I sympathize with his feelings, I  estimate his purposes. In short, he is for me a center of aims and  intentions which I interpret: he comes in question for me as a self  which has its meaning and has its unity. The more I am interested in his  opinions, the more I feel in every utterance, in every gesture, the  expression of his will and his purposes; their whole reality for me lies  in the fact that they point to something which the speaker intends; his  personality lies in his attitude towards the surroundings, towards the  world. Yet I may take an entirely different relation to the same man. I  may ask myself what processes are going on in his mind, what are the  real contents of his consciousness, that is, what perceptions and memory  pictures and imaginative ideas and feelings and emotions and judgments  and volitions are really present in his consciousness. I watch him to  find out, I observe his mental states, I do not ask whether I agree or  disagree; his will is for me now not something which has a meaning, but  simply something which occurs in his inner experience; his ideas now  have for me no reference to something in the world, but they are simply  contents of his consciousness; his memories now are for me not symbols  of a past to which he refers, but they are present pictures in his mind;  in short, what I now find is not a self which shows itself in its aims  and purposes and attitudes, but a complex content of consciousness which  is composed of numberless elements. I might say in the first place that  my friend was to me a subject whom I tried to understand by interpreting  his meaning, and in the second case, an object which I understand by  describing its structure, its elements, and their connections.    Both ways of looking on man are constantly needed. We might alternate  between them in any experience. In the heat of argument, my friend will  certainly be for me the subject with whose meanings I try to agree or  disagree, whose emotions carry me away, whose ideas open the world to  me. Yet in the next moment, I may notice that his ideas were shaped and  determined by certain earlier experiences; that they linked themselves  in memory according to certain laws of mental flow; that the vividness  of his ideas made him overlook certain impressions of the surroundings;  and that may turn my attention to an entirely different aspect of his  inner life. His feelings and emotions, his volitions and judgments now  have for me simply the character of processes which go on and which are  observed, which coincide and which succeed each other, which fuse and  overlap, and which are composed of smaller parts. My interest is now no  longer in the meaning and intentions of this self, but it belongs to the  structure and the connections in this system of mental facts. At first,  I wanted to understand him by living with him, by participating in his  attitudes, and by feeling with his will; now I want to understand him by  examining all the processes which go on in his consciousness, by  studying their make-up and their behavior, their elements and their  laws. In one case I wanted to interpret the man, and finally to  appreciate him; in the other case I wanted to describe his inner life,  and finally to explain it. The man whose inner life I want to share I  treat as a subject, the man whose inner life I want to describe and  explain I treat as an object.    I might express these two standpoints still otherwise. If my neighbor is  to me a subject, for instance, in the midst of an ordinary conversation,  he comes in question only with reference to his aims and meanings:  whatever he utters has a purpose and end. I understand his inner life by  taking a purposive point of view. On the other hand, the man whose inner  life is to me an object can satisfy my interest only if I understand  every particular happening in his mind from its preceding causes. I  transform his whole life into a chain of causes and effects. My  standpoint is thus a causal one. No doubt in our daily life, our  purposive interest and our causal interest may intertwine at any moment.  I may sympathize with the hopes and fears of my neighbor in a purposive  way, and may yet in the next moment consider from a causal standpoint  how these emotions of his are perhaps affected by his fatigue or by some  glasses of wine, or by a hereditary disposition, or by a suggestion; in  short, at one time I look out for the meaning of the emotion as a part  of the expression of a self, and at another time for the structure and  appearance of the emotion as a part of a causal chain of events. In both  directions I can go on with entire consistency, and there cannot be any  part of inner experience which cannot be fully brought under either  point of view. How far we have a right to mix the two standpoints in  practical life, we shall carefully examine; but it is clear that if we  want to understand the true meaning of the study of inner life, we have  no longer any right carelessly to mix the two standpoints without being  conscious of their fundamental difference. We must understand exactly  what the aim of the one and of the other is, and where each has its  particular value; science certainly has no right to throw together such  different views of life. And now this may be said at once: the causal  view only is the view of psychology; the purposive view lies outside of  psychology.    Such a separation does not at all aim to indicate that the one view is  more important than the other, or that the one has more scientific  dignity than the other; both yield us truth, and both may be carried  from the simplest and most trivial observations of daily life to the  highest elaborations of scholarship. To those who are inclined to give  all value and all credit only to the strictly psychological view, it may  be replied at once that surely our most immediate life experience is  carried on by the non-psychological attitude. If we love our family and  like our friends, and deal with the man of the street, we are certainly  moving in a world of purposive reality. We try to understand each other,  to agree and to disagree, to be in sympathy and"]]]
