There was one who jumped in from the top  steps without any preliminaries at all. Another would walk slowly in,  step by step, muttering his morning prayers the while. One was always in  a hurry, hastening home as soon as he was through with his dip. Another  was in no sort of hurry at all, taking his bath leisurely, followed with  a good rub-down, and a change from wet bathing clothes into clean ones,  including a careful adjustment of the folds of his waist cloth, ending  with a turn or two in the outer[4] garden, and the gathering of flowers,  with which he would finally saunter slowly homewards, radiating the cool  comfort of his refreshed body, as he went. This would go on till it was  past noon. Then the bathing places would be deserted and become silent.  Only the ducks remained, paddling about after water snails, or busy  preening their feathers, the live-long day.    When solitude thus reigned over the water, my whole attention would be  drawn to the shadows under the banyan tree. Some of its aerial roots,  creeping down along its trunk, had formed a dark complication of coils  at its base. It seemed as if into this mysterious region the laws of the  universe had not found entrance; as if some old-world dream-land had  escaped the divine vigilance and lingered on into the light of modern  day. Whom I used to see there, and what those beings did, it is not  possible to express in intelligible language. It was about this banyan  tree that I wrote later:        With tangled roots hanging down from your branches,          O ancient banyan tree,      You stand still day and night, like an ascetic at his          penances,      Do you ever remember the child whose fancy played          with your shadows?    Alas! that banyan tree is no more, nor the piece of water which served  to mirror the majestic forest-lord! Many of those who used to bathe  there have also followed into oblivion the shade of the banyan tree. And  that boy, grown older, is counting the alternations of light and  darkness which penetrate the complexities with which the roots he has  thrown off on all sides have encircled him.    Going out of the house was forbidden to us, in fact we had not even the  freedom of all its parts. We perforce took our peeps at nature from  behind the barriers. Beyond my reach there was this limitless thing  called the Outside, of which flashes and sounds and scents used  momentarily to come and touch me through its interstices. It seemed to  want to play with me through the bars with so many gestures. But it was  free and I was bound--there was no way of meeting. So the attraction was  all the stronger. The chalk line has been wiped away to-day, but the  confining ring is still there. The distant is just as distant, the  outside is still beyond me; and I am reminded of the poem I wrote when I  was older:          The tame bird was in a cage, the free bird was in the      forest,        They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.        The free bird cries, \"O my love, let us fly to wood.\"        The cage bird whispers, \"Come hither, let us both      live in the cage.\"        Says the free bird, \"Among bars, where is there room      to spread one's wings?\"        \"Alas,\" cries the cage bird, \"I should not know      where to sit perched in the sky.\"    The parapets of our terraced roofs were higher than my head. When I had  grown taller; when the tyranny of the servants had relaxed; when, with  the coming of a newly married bride into the house, I had achieved some  recognition as a companion of her leisure, then did I sometimes come up  to the terrace in the middle of the day. By that time everybody in the  house would have finished their meal; there would be an interval in the  business of the household; over the inner apartments would rest the  quiet of the midday siesta; the wet bathing clothes would be hanging  over the parapets to dry; the crows would be picking at the leavings  thrown on the refuse heap at the corner of the yard; in the solitude of  that interval the caged bird would, through the gaps in the parapet,  commune bill to bill with the free bird!    [Illustration: The Inner Garden was My Paradise]    I would stand and gaze.... My glance first falls on the row of cocoanut  trees on the further edge of our inner garden. Through these are seen  the \"Singhi's Garden\" with its cluster of huts[5] and tank, and on the  edge of the tank the dairy of our milkwoman, Tara; still further on,  mixed up with the tree-tops, the various shapes and different heights of  the terraced roofs of Calcutta, flashing back the blazing whiteness of  the midday sun, stretch right away into the grayish blue of the eastern  horizon. And some of these far distant dwellings from which stand  forth their roofed stair-ways leading up to the terrace, look as if with  uplifted finger and a wink they are hinting to me of the mysteries of  their interiors. Like the beggar at the palace door who imagines  impossible treasures to be held in the strong rooms closed to him, I can  hardly tell of the wealth of play and freedom which these unknown  dwellings seem to me crowded with. From the furthest depth of the sky  full of burning sunshine overhead the thin shrill cry of a kite reaches  my ear; and from the lane adjoining Singhi's Garden comes up, past the  houses silent in their noonday slumber, the sing-song of the  bangle-seller--_chai choori chai_ ... and my whole being would fly away  from the work-a-day world.    My father hardly ever stayed at home, he was constantly roaming about.  His rooms on the third storey used to remain shut up. I would pass my  hands through the venetian shutters, and thus opening the latch get the  door open, and spend the afternoon lying motionless on his sofa at the  south end. First of all it was a room always closed, and then there was  the stolen entry, this gave it a deep flavour of mystery; further the  broad empty expanse of terrace to the south, glowing in the rays of the  sun would set me day-dreaming.    There was yet another attraction. The water-works had just been started  in Calcutta, and in the first exuberance of its triumphant entry it did  not stint even the Indian quarters of their supply. In that golden age  of pipe water, it used to flow even up to my father's third storey  rooms. And turning on the shower tap I would indulge to my heart's  content in an untimely bath. Not so much for the comfort of it, as to  give rein to my desire to do just as I fancied. The alternation of the  joy of liberty, and the fear of being caught, made that shower of  municipal water send arrows of delight thrilling into me.    It was perhaps because the possibility of contact with the outside was  so remote that the joy of it came to me so much more readily. When  material is in profusion, the mind gets lazy and leaves everything to  it, forgetting that for a successful feast of joy its internal equipment  counts for more than the external. This is the chief lesson which his  infant state has to teach to man. There his possessions are few and  trivial, yet he needs no more for his happiness. The world of play is  spoilt for the unfortunate youngster who is burdened with an unlimited  quantity of playthings.    To call our inner garden a garden is to say a deal too much. Its  properties consisted of a citron tree, a couple of plum trees of  different varieties, and a row of cocoanut trees. In the centre was a  paved circle the cracks of which various grasses and weeds had invaded  and planted in them their victorious standards. Only those flowering  plants which refused to die of neglect continued uncomplainingly to  perform their respective duties without casting any aspersions on the  gardener. In the northern corner was a rice-husking shed, where the  inmates of the inner apartments would occasionally foregather when  household necessity demanded. This last vestige of rural life has since  owned defeat and slunk away ashamed and unnoticed.    None the less I suspect that Adam's garden of Eden could hardly have  been better adorned than this one of ours; for he and his paradise were  alike naked; they needed not to be furnished with material things. It is  only since his tasting of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and till  he can fully digest it, that man's need for external furniture and  embellishment persistently grows. Our inner garden was my paradise; it  was enough for me. I well remember how in the early autumn dawn I would  run there as soon as I was awake. A scent of dewy grass and foliage  would rush to meet me, and the morning with its cool fresh sunlight  would peep out at me over the top of the Eastern garden wall from below  the trembling tassels of the cocoanut palms.    There is another piece of vacant land to the north of the house which to  this day we call the _golabari_ (barn house). The name shows that in  some remote past this must have been the place where the year's store of  grain used to be kept in a barn. Then, as with brother and sister in  infancy, the likeness between town and country was visible all over. Now  the family resemblance can hardly be traced. This _golabari_ would be my  holiday haunt if I got the chance. It would hardly be correct to say  that I went there to play--it was the place not play, which drew me. Why  this was so, is difficult to tell. Perhaps its being a deserted bit of  waste land lying in an out-of-the-way corner gave it its charm for me.  It was entirely outside the living quarters and bore no stamp of  usefulness; moreover it was as unadorned as it was useless, for no one  had ever planted anything there; it was doubtless for these reasons that  this desert spot offered no resistance to the free play of the boy's  imagination. Whenever I got any loop-hole to evade the vigilance of my  warders and could contrive to reach the _golabari_ I felt I had a  holiday indeed.

She had been cruising for some time, and  had sent home a number of prizes, and was now returning herself to  England for another refit and to fill up her crew again. As she was a  very fast vessel, and the captain said that he intended to make straight  home and to avoid all doubtful sail, Mr. Blagrove at once accepted the  offer he made to take his wife and daughters back to England,  immediately he heard that his friend was looking for a passage for them.  Accordingly for the next week there was much packing and confusion. At  the end of that time the three ladies, after a tearful adieu, sailed for  England, and things settled down again.    Edgar felt the absence of his sisters keenly. There were but a handful  of English traders in the city, and none of these had boys who were near  enough to his own age to be companions. However, it had the effect of  enabling him, without interruption, to settle down steadily to work with  his father, and to make himself acquainted with the details of the  business. This he did so industriously that Mr. Blagrove said more than  once: \"You are getting on so well, Edgar, that I shall be able to go  home for my holiday with the comfortable conviction that in yours and  Muller's hands matters will go on very well here, especially as business  is so slack.\"    It was about three months after his return that Edgar had an opportunity  of finding the advantage of his skill in boxing. He had, on the day  after he came back, had a sack of sawdust hung up in his room, and every  morning he used to pummel this for half an hour before taking his bath,  and again before going to bed, so that he kept his muscles in a state of  training. Moreover, this exercise had the advantage that it enabled him  to stand the heat of the climate much better than he would otherwise  have done, and to save him from any of that feeling of lassitude and  depression so usual among Englishmen working in hot climates. He was  returning one day from a ride; dusk had fallen, and when just beyond the  limits of the town he heard shouts and cries, and saw a scuffle going on  in the road. Cantering on, he leapt from his horse, dropped the reins on  its neck, and ran forward.    Two of the lowest class Maltese or Greeks were dragging a young Arab  along, holding his hands to prevent him getting at his knife, and  beating him about the head with their disengaged hands. It was evident  that he was not one of the dwellers in the city, but an Arab of the  desert. His horse stood near, and he had apparently been dragged from  it.    \"What is the matter? what are you beating him for?\" he asked in Italian.    \"This Arab dog pushed against us with his horse, and when we cursed him,  struck at us.\"    \"Well, if he did, you have punished him enough; but perhaps his story is  a different one.\"    \"Go your way, boy,\" one exclaimed with a Greek oath, \"or we will throw  you into that fountain, as we are going to do him.\"    \"You will, eh? Unloose that lad at once or it will be worse for you.\"    The man uttered a shout of rage. \"Hold this young Arab wolf's other  hand, Giaccamo, so that he cannot use his knife. I will settle this  boy;\" and his companion seized the lad's other wrist.    He rushed at Edgar, waving his arms in windmill fashion, thinking to  strike him down without the least difficulty, but he was astounded at  being met with a terrific blow on the nose, which nigh threw him off  his balance, and this was followed an instant later by another on the  point of his chin, which hurled him back, half-stunned, to the ground,  with a vague impression in his mind that his head was broken into  fragments. Before he even thought of rising, Edgar sprang at his  companion, who, releasing the Arab boy's hands, grasped his knife, but  before he could draw it, a blow, given with all Edgar's strength and the  impetus of his bound forward, stretched him also on the ground, his  knife flying from his hand.    The Arab boy had drawn his knife also, but Edgar exclaimed to him in his  own language, \"No, no, pick up the other knife, and then stand over him,  but don't stab him.\" Then he turned to his first assailant, who was  rising to his feet, still confused and bewildered. He had instinctively  drawn his knife.    \"Drop your knife, drop it!\" Edgar cried. But with an oath the man sprang  at him. His eyes, however, were full of tears, his ears sung, and his  head buzzed, partly from the blow on the jaw, partly from the force with  which he had come in contact with the ground. Edward lightly sprung  aside and avoided the cut aimed at him, and then delivered a blow with  all his force just in front of the ear, and the man dropped again as if  shot. In a moment Edgar had wrenched the knife from his hand, then he  turned to the young Arab.    \"That is enough,\" he said; \"they have both got more than they wanted;  they are harmless now, we have their two knives.\"    The Arab, who was panting from his exertions, and who had evidently  restrained himself with difficulty from plunging his knife into his  fallen assailant, turned round towards him.    \"Who are you, brother, whose blows fell men like strokes of lightning?\"    \"My name is Edgar Blagrove. I am the son of a merchant, whose place of  business is in the great square. Who are you, and how did this business  begin?\"    \"My name is Sidi Ben Ouafy. I am the son of a chief. My father's tribe  live in the oasis ten miles east of the old lake. I was riding from the  town when these two men, for whom there was, as you see, plenty of room  in the road, staggered suddenly against me, whether with evil intent or  merely to enjoy the pleasure of seeing me rolling in the dust, I know  not. They nearly unseated me from the suddenness of the attack, and as I  recovered I certainly struck at them with my whip. One seized me by the  foot and threw me off my horse, and then, as you saw, they fell upon me,  beat me, and were dragging me to the fountain to throw me in when you  came up. Had they not heard your horse coming along they would, I  believe, have killed me. Henceforth you are my brother; my horses and  all that I have are yours, and every sword of our tribe would leap from  its scabbard in your defence were it needed. To-morrow I will ride in  again, and my father himself will assuredly come with me. I cannot speak  of my gratitude now, my head is still dizzy with the blows they gave me;  even yet I cannot understand how it was that these two men have thus  fallen before you, and you with no weapon in your hands. Are they dead?\"    \"Not they,\" Edgar said scornfully; \"they are wondering what has happened  to them, and fear to move, not knowing that their own knives might not  be driven into their hearts did they venture to rise. Well, good-bye,  Sidi; I will see you off first; and I should advise you, when you ride  into the town again, to bring your pistols with you. Like enough these  scoundrels will try to get revenge for this defeat.\"    \"I will do so. I know not why I did not carry them to-day. I will not  only bring them, but two of my tribesmen shall ride with me. But  methinks that you will be in greater danger than I shall, brother.\"    \"I shall be on the look-out, and will, for a time, carry pistols with  me; but I do not often go out after dark, and have no occasion ever to  enter the streets where rogues of this sort live. As to an open attack,  I have no fear of it; but I have no doubt that either of those  scoundrels would plant a knife between my shoulders if they had a chance  to do so.\"    Both the lads mounted their horses, and after a few words of farewell  rode off in different directions. Not until the sound of the horses'  hoofs died away did the two figures in the road move, then they sat up.    \"What has happened, Zeno?\"    \"I know not, save that my head is ringing. I feel as if my jaws were  broken, and my nose is so swelled that it seems as big as my head.\"    \"And I can scarcely see from my eyes,\" the other said. \"Cospetto, never  before have I been thus handled!\"    \"We will kill him!\" the other said furiously.    \"That of course; I know not who he was, but we shall doubtless find out.  I can hardly believe even now that it was with his hand that he struck  us--it was done so quickly. He was there--then I struck at him,  when--paff!--and it seemed to me that the air was full of stars; then,  paff again! my jaws cracked, I fell backwards, there was a crash, and  the world seemed to have come to an end. And you, Giaccamo, what did he  do to you?\"    \"It was like that, except that I only had one blow, and there was an  end of it. I was drawing my knife when it came--how, I know not. My  knife flew from my hand--there was a flash of fire from my eyes, and I  was on the ground, and thought it best to lie there, lest that accursed  young Arab should take it into his head to sheathe my knife in my body.  The next time we will give the young fellow no chance to try those  strange tricks upon us.\"    \"You are right, Giaccamo; I would sooner fight against even Thomasso,  who is the best knife-player in Alexandria, than face that fellow again.  Who can he be, I wonder?\"    Edgar rode home, and after seeing his horse taken into the stable, went  into the house.    \"I have found my boxing of use, father.\"    \"How is that, Edgar?\"    The lad told him what had happened.    \"You were quite right to strike, my boy,\" his father went on when he had  heard the story; \"'tis likely enough that those ruffians would have  killed the lad. There are fellows here who would do murder for the sake  of a few copper coins; and, doubtless, those men thought that the young  chief would have some trinkets about him that would pay them for their  trouble. I am sorry that you did not let the Arab put his knife into  them; it would have been a good riddance, for the town abounds with  rascals of that kind--the scum of the Mediterranean, men who have made  their native towns too hot to hold"]]]
