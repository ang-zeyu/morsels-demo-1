Budget    This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital expenditures.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Capital    This entry gives the name of the seat of government, its geographic  coordinates, the time difference relative to Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC) and the time observed in Washington, DC, and, if applicable,  information on daylight saving time (DST). Where appropriate, a special  note has been added to highlight those countries that have multiple  time zones.    Climate    This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes  throughout the year.    Coastline    This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area  (including islands) and the sea.    Communications    This category deals with the means of exchanging information and  includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet host entries.    Communications - note    This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution    This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)    UTC is the international atomic time scale that serves as the basis of  timekeeping for most of the world. The hours, minutes, and seconds  expressed by UTC represent the time of day at the Prime Meridian (0ยบ  longitude) located near Greenwich, England as reckoned from midnight.  UTC is calculated by the Bureau International des Poids et Measures  (BIPM) in Sevres, France. The BIPM averages data collected from more  than 200 atomic time and frequency standards located at about 50  laboratories worldwide. UTC is the basis for all civil time with the  Earth divided into time zones expressed as positive or negative  differences from UTC. UTC is also referred to as \"Zulu time.\" See the  Standard Time Zones of the World map included with the Reference Maps.    Country data codes    see Data codes    Country map    Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps  were produced from the best information available at the time of  preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name    This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional  long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local  long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the  Terminology note.    Crude oil    See entry for oil.    Currency (code)    This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and, in  parenthesis, gives the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.    Current account balance    This entry records a country's net trade in goods and services, plus  net earnings from rents, interest, profits, and dividends, and net  transfer payments (such as pension funds and worker remittances) to and  from the rest of the world during the period specified. These figures  are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Data codes    This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-Reference List of  Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic  Data Codes.    Date of information    In general, information available as of 1 January 2006, was used in the  preparation of this edition.    Daylight Saving Time (DST)    This entry is included for those entities that have adopted a policy of  adjusting the official local time forward, usually one hour, from  Standard Time during summer months. Such policies are most common in  mid-latitude regions.    Death rate    This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death  rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a  country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all  ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt - external    This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents  repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Dependency status    This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas    This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation    The US Government has diplomatic relations with 188 independent states,  including 187 of the 192 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US has  diplomatic relations with 1 independent state that is not in the UN,  the Holy See, as well as with the EU.    Diplomatic representation from the US    This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation in the US    This entry includes the chief of mission, chancery, telephone, FAX,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Disputes - international    This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving borders  or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,  geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does  not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US  Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index    This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of  family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz  curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number  of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the  ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45  degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45  degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the  closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini  index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more  unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve  from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-  Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with  perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree  line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with  perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal  axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.    Economic aid - donor    This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations to  developing countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as  financial assistance that is concessional in character, has the main  objective to promote economic development and welfare of the less  developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private  flows. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,  not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Economic aid - recipient    This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and  statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development  Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and  from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included  in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.  Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The  entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments. These  figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Economy    This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,  and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy - overview    This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree  of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most  important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It  also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most  recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key  future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption    This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy  between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in  transmission and distribution.    Electricity - exports    This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - imports    This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - production    This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2752"],[0,"Martin Guerre (#3)"],[1,"gloomy thoughts and recalls so many  blighted hopes. The child had gone into the house. Bertrande, still  sitting at the door, resting her forehead on her hand, thought sadly of  her uncle's words; recalling in imagination the past scenes which they  suggested, the time of their childhood, when, married so young, they  were as yet only playmates, prefacing the graver duties of life by  innocent pleasures; then of the love which grew with their increasing  age; then of how this love became altered, changing on her side into  passion, on his into indifference. She tried to recollect him as he had  been on the eve of his departure, young and handsome, carrying his head  high, coming home from a fatiguing hunt and sitting by his son's cradle;  and then also she remembered bitterly the jealous suspicions she had  conceived, the anger with which she had allowed them to escape her, the  consequent quarrel, followed by the disappearance of her offended  husband, and the eight succeeding years of solitude and mourning. She  wept over his desertion; over the desolation of her life, seeing around  her only indifferent or selfish people, and caring only to live for her  child's sake, who gave her at least a shadowy reflection of the husband  she had lost. \"Lost--yes, lost for ever!\" she said to herself, sighing,  and looking again at the fields whence she had so often seen him coming  at this same twilight hour, returning to his home for the evening meal.  She cast a wandering eye on the distant hills, which showed a black  outline against a yet fiery western sky, then let it fall on a little  grove of olive trees planted on the farther side of the brook which  skirted her dwelling. Everything was calm; approaching night brought  silence along with darkness: it was exactly what she saw every evening,  but to leave which required always an effort.    She rose to re-enter the house, when her attention was caught by a  movement amongst the trees. For a moment she thought she was mistaken,  but the branches again rustled, then parted asunder, and the form of a  man appeared on the other side of the brook. Terrified, Bertrande tried  to scream, but not a sound escaped her lips; her voice seemed paralyzed  by terror, as in an evil dream. And she almost thought it was a dream,  for notwithstanding the dark shadows cast around this indistinct  semblance, she seemed to recognise features once dear to her. Had her  bitter reveries ended by making her the victim of a hallucination? She  thought her brain was giving way, and sank on her knees to pray for  help. But the figure remained; it stood motionless, with folded arms,  silently gazing at her! Then she thought of witchcraft, of evil demons,  and superstitious as every one was in those days, she kissed a crucifix  which hung from her neck, and fell fainting on the ground. With one  spring the phantom crossed the brook and stood beside her.    \"Bertrande!\" it said in a voice of emotion. She raised her head, uttered  a piercing cry, and was clasped in her husband's arms.    The whole village became aware of this event that same evening. The  neighbours crowded round Bertrande's door, Martin's friends and  relations naturally wishing to see him after this miraculous  reappearance, while those who had never known him desired no less to  gratify their curiosity; so that the hero of the little drama, instead  of remaining quietly at home with his wife, was obliged to exhibit  himself publicly in a neighbouring barn. His four sisters burst through  the crowd and fell on his neck weeping; his uncle examined him  doubtfully at first, then extended his arms. Everybody recognised him,  beginning with the old servant Margherite, who had been with the young  couple ever since their wedding-day. People observed only that a riper  age had strengthened his features, and given more character to his  countenance and more development to his powerful figure; also that he  had a scar over the right eyebrow, and that he limped slightly. These  were the marks of wounds he had received, he said; which now no longer  troubled him. He appeared anxious to return to his wife and child, but  the crowd insisted on hearing the story of his adventures during his  voluntary absence, and he was obliged to satisfy them. Eight years ago,  he said, the desire to see more of the world had gained an irresistible  mastery over him; he yielded to it, and departed secretly. A natural  longing took him to his birthplace in Biscay, where he had seen his  surviving relatives. There he met the Cardinal of Burgos, who took him  into his service, promising him profit, hard knocks to give and take,  and plenty of adventure. Some time after, he left the cardinal's  household for that of his brother, who, much against his will, compelled  him to follow him to the war and bear arms against the French. Thus he  found himself on the Spanish side on the day of St. Quentin, and  received a terrible gun-shot wound in the leg. Being carried into a  house a an adjoining village, he fell into the hands of a surgeon, who  insisted that the leg must be amputated immediately, but who left him  for a moment, and never returned. Then he encountered a good old woman,  who dressed his wound and nursed him night and day. So that in a few  weeks he recovered, and was able to set out for Artigues, too thankful  to return to his house and land, still more to his wife and child, and  fully resolved never to leave them again.    Having ended his story, he shook hands with his still wondering  neighbours, addressing by name some who had been very young when he  left, and who, hearing their names, came forward now as grown men,  hardly recognisable, but much pleased at being remembered. He returned  his sisters' carresses, begged his uncle's forgiveness for the trouble  he had given in his boyhood, recalling with mirth the various  corrections received. He mentioned also an Augustinian monk who had  taught him to read, and another reverend father, a Capuchin, whose  irregular conduct had caused much scandal in the neighbourhood. In  short, notwithstanding his prolonged absence, he seemed to have a  perfect recollection of places, persons, and things. The good people  overwhelmed him with congratulations, vying with one another in praising  him for having the good sense to come home, and in describing the grief  and the perfect virtue of his Bertrande. Emotion was excited, many wept,  and several bottles from Martin Guerre's cellar were emptied. At length  the assembly dispersed, uttering many exclamations about the  extraordinary chances of Fate, and retired to their own homes, excited,  astonished, and gratified, with the one exception of old Pierre Guerre,  who had been struck by an unsatisfactory remark made by his nephew, and  who dreamed all night about the chances of pecuniary loss augured by the  latter's return.    It was midnight before the husband and wife were alone and able to give  vent to their feelings. Bertrande still felt half stupefied; she could  not believe her own eyes and ears, nor realise that she saw again in her  marriage chamber her husband of eight years ago, him for whom she had  wept; whose death she had deplored only a few hours previously. In the  sudden shock caused by so much joy succeeding so much grief, she had not  been able to express what she felt; her confused ideas were difficult to  explain, and she seemed deprived of the powers of speech and reflection.  When she became calmer and more capable of analysing her feelings, she  was astonished not to feel towards her husband the same affection which  had moved her so strongly a few hours before. It was certainly himself,  those were the same features, that was the man to whom she had willingly  given her hand, her heart, herself, and yet now that she saw him again a  cold barrier of shyness, of modesty, seemed to have risen between them.  His first kiss, even, had not made her happy: she blushed and felt  saddened--a curious result of the long absence! She could not define the  changes wrought by years in his appearance: his countenance seemed  harsher, yet the lines of his face, his outer man, his whole  personality, did not seem altered, but his soul had changed its nature,  a different mind looked forth from those eyes. Bertrande knew him for  her husband, and yet she hesitated. Even so Penelope, on the, return of  Ulysses, required a certain proof to confirm the evidence of her eyes,  and her long absent husband had to remind her of secrets known only to  herself.    Martin, however, as if he understood Bertrande's feeling and divined  some secret mistrust, used the most tender and affectionate phrases, and  even the very pet names which close intimacy had formerly endeared to  them.    \"My queen,\" he said, \"my beautiful dove, can you not lay aside your  resentment? Is it still so strong that no submission can soften it?  Cannot my repentance find grace in your eyes? My Bertrande, my Bertha,  my Bertranilla, as I used to call you.\"    She tried to smile, but stopped short, puzzled; the names were the very  same, but the inflexion of voice quite different.    Martin took her hands in his. \"What pretty hands! Do you still wear my  ring? Yes, here it is, and with it the sapphire ring I gave you the day  Sanxi was born.\"    Bertrande did not answer, but she took the child and placed him in his  father's arms.    Martin showered caresses on his son, and spoke of the time when he  carried him as a baby in the garden, lifting him up to the fruit trees,  so that he could reach and try to bite the fruit. He recollected one day  when the poor child got his leg terribly torn by thorns, and convinced  himself, not without emotion, that the scar could still be seen.    Bertrande was touched by this display of affectionate recollections, and  felt vexed at her own coldness. She came up to Martin and laid her hand  in his. He said gently--    \"My departure caused you"]]]
