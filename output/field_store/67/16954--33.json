In this  year the directors of the John Jones fund awoke to the fact that they  were in a dreadful predicament. According to the agreement under which  John Jones deposited his Dollar away back in the year 1921, interest was  to be compounded annually at three percent. In the year 2900 A.D., the  thirty-ninth generation of John Jones was alive, being represented by a  gentleman named J664M42721Male, who was thirty years of age and engaged  to be married to a young lady named T246M42652Female.    \"Doubtless, you will ask, what was the predicament in which the  directors found themselves. Simply this:    \"A careful appraisement of the wealth on Neptune, Uranus, Saturn,  Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and likewise Earth, together with an  accurate calculation of the remaining heat in the Sun and an  appraisement of that heat at a very decent valuation per calorie,  demonstrated that the total wealth of the Solar System amounted to  $6,309,525,241,362.15.    \"But unfortunately, a simple computation showed that if Mr.  J664M42721Male married Miss T246M42652Female, and was blessed by a child  by the year 2921, which year marked the thousandth year since the  deposit of the John Jones Dollar, then in that year there would be due  the child, the following amount:        2921   1,000 years   $6,310,000,000,000    \"It simply showed beyond all possibility of argument, that by 2921 A.D.,  we would be $474,758,637.85 shy--that we would be unable to meet the  debt to John Jones the fortieth.    \"I tell you, gentlemen, the Board of Directors was frantic. Such wild  suggestions were put forth as the sending of an expeditionary force to  the nearest star in order to capture some other Solar System and thus  obtain more territory to make up the deficit. But that project was  impossible on account of the number of years that it would have  required.    \"Visions of immense law suits disturbed the slumber of those unfortunate  individuals who formed the John Jones Dollar Directorship. But on the  brink of one of the biggest civil actions the courts had ever known,  something occurred that altered everything.\"    The professor again withdrew the tiny instrument from his vest pocket,  held it to his ear and adjusted the switch. A metallic voice rasped:  \"Fifteen o'clock and fifty-two minutes--fifteen o'clock and fifty-two  minutes--fift--\" He replaced the instrument and went on with his talk.    \"I must hasten to the conclusion of my lecture, gentlemen, as I have an  engagement with Professor C122B24999Male of the University of Saturn at  sixteen o'clock. Now, let me see; I was discussing the big civil action  that was hanging over the heads of the John Jones Dollar directors.    \"Well, this Mr. J664M42721Male, the thirty-ninth descendant of the  original John Jones, had a lover's quarrel with Miss T246M42652Female,  which immediately destroyed the probability of their marriage. Neither  gave in to the other. Neither ever married. And when Mr. J664M42721Male  died in 2946 A.D., of a broken heart, as it was claimed, he was single  and childless.    \"As a result, there was no one to turn the Solar System over to.  Immediately, the Interplanetary Government stepped in and took  possession of it. At that instant, of course, private property ceased.  In the twinkling of an eye almost, we reached the true socialistic and  democratic condition for which man had futilely hoped throughout the  ages.    \"That is all today, gentlemen. Class is dismissed.\"    One by one, the faces faded from the Visaphone.    For a moment, the professor stood ruminating.    \"A wonderful man, that old socialist, John Jones the first,\" he said  softly to himself, \"a farseeing man, a bright man, considering that he  lived in such a dark era as the twentieth century. But how nearly his  well-contrived scheme went wrong. Suppose that fortieth descendant had  been born?\"      THE END          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was      first published in _Amazing Stories_ April 1927.

You will probably discover he is full of firearms  and threats of slaughter, but you have only to click a revolver to see  him collapse. Have you a revolver, by the way?\"    \"Oh, nonsense,\" said the other, roughly, \"I cannot engage myself in that  kind of melodrama.\"    \"It is not nonsense,\" insisted the other, \"when you are in Rome, et  cetera, and when you have to deal with a low-class Greek you must use  methods which will at least impress him. If you thrash him, he will  never forgive you and will probably stick a knife into you or your wife.  If you meet his melodrama with melodrama and at the psychological moment  produce your revolver; you will secure the effect you require. Have you  a revolver?\"    John went to his desk and, pulling open a drawer, took out a small  Browning.    \"That is the extent of my armory,\" he said, \"it has never been fired and  was sent to me by an unknown admirer last Christmas.\"    \"A curious Christmas present,\" said the other, examining the weapon.    \"I suppose the mistaken donor imagined from my books that I lived in  a veritable museum of revolvers, sword sticks and noxious drugs,\" said  Lexman, recovering some of his good humour; \"it was accompanied by a  card.\"    \"Do you know how it works?\" asked the other.    \"I have never troubled very much about it,\" replied Lexman, \"I know that  it is loaded by slipping back the cover, but as my admirer did not send  ammunition, I never even practised with it.\"    There was a knock at the door.    \"That is the post,\" explained John.    The maid had one letter on the salver and the author took it up with a  frown.    \"From Vassalaro,\" he said, when the girl had left the room.    The Greek took the letter in his hand and examined it.    \"He writes a vile fist,\" was his only comment as he handed it back to  John.    He slit open the thin, buff envelope and took out half a dozen sheets of  yellow paper, only a single sheet of which was written upon. The letter  was brief:      \"I must see you to-night without fail,\" ran the scrawl; \"meet me     at the crossroads between Beston Tracey and the Eastbourne     Road.  I shall be there at eleven o'clock, and, if you want to     preserve your life, you had better bring me a substantial     instalment.\"    It was signed \"Vassalaro.\"    John read the letter aloud. \"He must be mad to write a letter like  that,\" he said; \"I'll meet the little devil and teach him such a lesson  in politeness as he is never likely to forget.\"    He handed the letter to the other and Kara read it in silence.    \"Better take your revolver,\" he said as he handed it back.    John Lexman looked at his watch.    \"I have an hour yet, but it will take me the best part of twenty minutes  to reach the Eastbourne Road.\"    \"Will you see him?\" asked Kara, in a tone of surprise.    \"Certainly,\" Lexman replied emphatically: \"I cannot have him coming up  to the house and making a scene and that is certainly what the little  beast will do.\"    \"Will you pay him?\" asked Kara softly.    John made no answer. There was probably 10 pounds in the house and a  cheque which was due on the morrow would bring him another 30 pounds.  He looked at the letter again. It was written on paper of an unusual  texture. The surface was rough almost like blotting paper and in some  places the ink absorbed by the porous surface had run. The blank sheets  had evidently been inserted by a man in so violent a hurry that he had  not noticed the extravagance.    \"I shall keep this letter,\" said John.    \"I think you are well advised. Vassalaro probably does not know that he  transgresses a law in writing threatening letters and that should be a  very strong weapon in your hand in certain eventualities.\"    There was a tiny safe in one corner of the study and this John opened  with a key which he took from his pocket. He pulled open one of the  steel drawers, took out the papers which were in it and put in their  place the letter, pushed the drawer to, and locked it.    All the time Kara was watching him intently as one who found more than  an ordinary amount of interest in the novelty of the procedure.    He took his leave soon afterwards.    \"I would like to come with you to your interesting meeting,\" he said,  \"but unfortunately I have business elsewhere. Let me enjoin you to take  your revolver and at the first sign of any bloodthirsty intention on the  part of my admirable compatriot, produce it and click it once or twice,  you won't have to do more.\"    Grace rose from the piano as Kara entered the little drawing-room and  murmured a few conventional expressions of regret that the visitor's  stay had been so short. That there was no sincerity in that regret Kara,  for one, had no doubt. He was a man singularly free from illusions.    They stayed talking a little while.    \"I will see if your chauffeur is asleep,\" said John, and went out of the  room.    There was a little silence after he had gone.    \"I don't think you are very glad to see me,\" said Kara. His frankness  was a little embarrassing to the girl and she flushed slightly.    \"I am always glad to see you, Mr. Kara, or any other of my husband's  friends,\" she said steadily.    He inclined his head.    \"To be a friend of your husband is something,\" he said, and then as if  remembering something, \"I wanted to take a book away with me--I wonder  if your husband would mind my getting it?\"    \"I will find it for you.\"    \"Don't let me bother you,\" he protested, \"I know my way.\"    Without waiting for her permission he left the girl with the unpleasant  feeling that he was taking rather much for granted. He was gone less  than a minute and returned with a book under his arm.    \"I have not asked Lexman's permission to take it,\" he said, \"but I am  rather interested in the author. Oh, here you are,\" he turned to John  who came in at that moment. \"Might I take this book on Mexico?\" he  asked. \"I will return it in the morning.\"    They stood at the door, watching the tail light of the motor disappear  down the drive; and returned in silence to the drawing room.    \"You look worried, dear,\" she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.    He smiled faintly.    \"Is it the money?\" she asked anxiously.    For a moment he was tempted to tell her of the letter. He stifled the  temptation realizing that she would not consent to his going out if she  knew the truth.    \"It is nothing very much,\" he said. \"I have to go down to Beston Tracey  to meet the last train. I am expecting some proofs down.\"    He hated lying to her, and even an innocuous lie of this character was  repugnant to him.    \"I'm afraid you have had a dull evening,\" he said, \"Kara was not very  amusing.\"    She looked at him thoughtfully.    \"He has not changed very much,\" she said slowly.    \"He's a wonderfully handsome chap, isn't he?\" he asked in a tone of  admiration. \"I can't understand what you ever saw in a fellow like me,  when you had a man who was not only rich, but possibly the best-looking  man in the world.\"    She shivered a little.    \"I have seen a side of Mr. Kara that is not particularly beautiful,\" she  said. \"Oh, John, I am afraid of that man!\"    He looked at her in astonishment.    \"Afraid?\" he asked. \"Good heavens, Grace, what a thing to say! Why I  believe he'd do anything for you.\"    \"That is exactly what I am afraid of,\" she said in a low voice.    She had a reason which she did not reveal. She had first met Remington  Kara in Salonika two years before. She had been doing a tour through the  Balkans with her father--it was the last tour the famous archeologist  made--and had met the man who was fated to have such an influence upon  her life at a dinner given by the American Consul.    Many were the stories which were told about this Greek with his  Jove-like face, his handsome carriage and his limitless wealth. It  was said that his mother was an American lady who had been captured by  Albanian brigands and was sold to one of the Albanian chiefs who fell  in love with her, and for her sake became a Protestant. He had been  educated at Yale and at Oxford, and was known to be the possessor of  vast wealth, and was virtually king of a hill district forty miles out  of Durazzo. Here he reigned supreme, occupying a beautiful house which  he had built by an Italian architect, and the fittings and appointments  of which had been imported from the luxurious centres of the world.    In Albania they called him \"Kara Rumo,\" which meant \"The Black Roman,\"  for no particular reason so far as any one could judge, for his skin was  as fair as a Saxon's, and his close-cropped curls were almost golden.    He had fallen in love with Grace Terrell. At first his attentions had  amused her, and then there came a time when they frightened her, for the  man's fire and passion had been unmistakable. She had made it plain to  him that he could base no hopes upon her returning his love, and, in a  scene which she even now shuddered to recall, he had revealed something  of his wild and reckless nature. On the following day she did not see  him, but two days later, when returning through the Bazaar from a dance  which had been given by the Governor General, her carriage was stopped,  she was forcibly dragged from its interior, and her cries were stifled  with a cloth impregnated with a scent of a peculiar aromatic sweetness.  Her assailants were about to thrust her into another carriage, when a  party of British bluejackets who had been on leave came upon the scene,  and, without knowing anything of the nationality of the girl, had  rescued her.    In her heart of hearts she did not doubt Kara's complicity in this  medieval attempt to gain a wife, but of this adventure she had told  her "]]]
