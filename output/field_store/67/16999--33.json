I don't want to see you on  your travels. I'd rather see you when they're over. I should like to see  you when you're tired and satiated,\" Osmond added in a moment. \"I shall  prefer you in that state.\"    Isabel, with her eyes bent, fingered the pages of M. Ampere. \"You turn  things into ridicule without seeming to do it, though not, I think,  without intending it. You've no respect for my travels--you think them  ridiculous.\"    \"Where do you find that?\"    She went on in the same tone, fretting the edge of her book with the  paper-knife. \"You see my ignorance, my blunders, the way I wander about  as if the world belonged to me, simply because--because it has been put  into my power to do so. You don't think a woman ought to do that. You  think it bold and ungraceful.\"    \"I think it beautiful,\" said Osmond. \"You know my opinions--I've treated  you to enough of them. Don't you remember my telling you that one ought  to make one's life a work of art? You looked rather shocked at first;  but then I told you that it was exactly what you seemed to me to be  trying to do with your own.\"    She looked up from her book. \"What you despise most in the world is bad,  is stupid art.\"    \"Possibly. But yours seem to me very clear and very good.\"    \"If I were to go to Japan next winter you would laugh at me,\" she went  on.    Osmond gave a smile--a keen one, but not a laugh, for the tone of their  conversation was not jocose. Isabel had in fact her solemnity; he had  seen it before. \"You have one!\"    \"That's exactly what I say. You think such an idea absurd.\"    \"I would give my little finger to go to Japan; it's one of the countries  I want most to see. Can't you believe that, with my taste for old  lacquer?\"    \"I haven't a taste for old lacquer to excuse me,\" said Isabel.    \"You've a better excuse--the means of going. You're quite wrong in  your theory that I laugh at you. I don't know what has put it into your  head.\"    \"It wouldn't be remarkable if you did think it ridiculous that I should  have the means to travel when you've not; for you know everything and I  know nothing.\"    \"The more reason why you should travel and learn,\" smiled Osmond.  \"Besides,\" he added as if it were a point to be made, \"I don't know  everything.\"    Isabel was not struck with the oddity of his saying this gravely; she  was thinking that the pleasantest incident of her life--so it pleased  her to qualify these too few days in Rome, which she might musingly have  likened to the figure of some small princess of one of the ages of dress  overmuffled in a mantle of state and dragging a train that it took pages  or historians to hold up--that this felicity was coming to an end. That  most of the interest of the time had been owing to Mr. Osmond was a  reflexion she was not just now at pains to make; she had already done  the point abundant justice. But she said to herself that if there were  a danger they should never meet again, perhaps after all it would be  as well. Happy things don't repeat themselves, and her adventure wore  already the changed, the seaward face of some romantic island from  which, after feasting on purple grapes, she was putting off while the  breeze rose. She might come back to Italy and find him different--this  strange man who pleased her just as he was; and it would be better  not to come than run the risk of that. But if she was not to come the  greater the pity that the chapter was closed; she felt for a moment a  pang that touched the source of tears. The sensation kept her  silent, and Gilbert Osmond was silent too; he was looking at her. \"Go  everywhere,\" he said at last, in a low, kind voice; \"do everything; get  everything out of life. Be happy,--be triumphant.\"    \"What do you mean by being triumphant?\"    \"Well, doing what you like.\"    \"To triumph, then, it seems to me, is to fail! Doing all the vain things  one likes is often very tiresome.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Osmond with his quiet quickness. \"As I intimated just  now, you'll be tired some day.\" He paused a moment and then he went on:  \"I don't know whether I had better not wait till then for something I  want to say to you.\"    \"Ah, I can't advise you without knowing what it is. But I'm horrid when  I'm tired,\" Isabel added with due inconsequence.    \"I don't believe that. You're angry, sometimes--that I can believe,  though I've never seen it. But I'm sure you're never 'cross.'\"    \"Not even when I lose my temper?\"    \"You don't lose it--you find it, and that must be beautiful.\" Osmond  spoke with a noble earnestness. \"They must be great moments to see.\"    \"If I could only find it now!\" Isabel nervously cried.    \"I'm not afraid; I should fold my arms and admire you. I'm speaking very  seriously.\" He leaned forward, a hand on each knee; for some moments he  bent his eyes on the floor. \"What I wish to say to you,\" he went on at  last, looking up, \"is that I find I'm in love with you.\"    She instantly rose. \"Ah, keep that till I am tired!\"    \"Tired of hearing it from others?\" He sat there raising his eyes to her.  \"No, you may heed it now or never, as you please. But after all I must  say it now.\" She had turned away, but in the movement she had stopped  herself and dropped her gaze upon him. The two remained a while in this  situation, exchanging a long look--the large, conscious look of the  critical hours of life. Then he got up and came near her, deeply  respectful, as if he were afraid he had been too familiar. \"I'm  absolutely in love with you.\"    He had repeated the announcement in a tone of almost impersonal  discretion, like a man who expected very little from it but who spoke  for his own needed relief. The tears came into her eyes: this time  they obeyed the sharpness of the pang that suggested to her somehow  the slipping of a fine bolt--backward, forward, she couldn't have said  which. The words he had uttered made him, as he stood there, beautiful  and generous, invested him as with the golden air of early autumn; but,  morally speaking, she retreated before them--facing him still--as she  had retreated in the other cases before a like encounter. \"Oh don't say  that, please,\" she answered with an intensity that expressed the dread  of having, in this case too, to choose and decide. What made her dread  great was precisely the force which, as it would seem, ought to have  banished all dread--the sense of something within herself, deep down,  that she supposed to be inspired and trustful passion. It was there  like a large sum stored in a bank--which there was a terror in having to  begin to spend. If she touched it, it would all come out.    \"I haven't the idea that it will matter much to you,\" said Osmond. \"I've  too little to offer you. What I have--it's enough for me; but it's not  enough for you. I've neither fortune, nor fame, nor extrinsic advantages  of any kind. So I offer nothing. I only tell you because I think it  can't offend you, and some day or other it may give you pleasure. It  gives me pleasure, I assure you,\" he went on, standing there before her,  considerately inclined to her, turning his hat, which he had taken  up, slowly round with a movement which had all the decent tremor of  awkwardness and none of its oddity, and presenting to her his firm,  refined, slightly ravaged face. \"It gives me no pain, because it's  perfectly simple. For me you'll always be the most important woman in  the world.\"    Isabel looked at herself in this character--looked intently, thinking  she filled it with a certain grace. But what she said was not an  expression of any such complacency. \"You don't offend me; but you  ought to remember that, without being offended, one may be incommoded,  troubled.\" \"Incommoded,\" she heard herself saying that, and it struck  her as a ridiculous word. But it was what stupidly came to her.    \"I remember perfectly. Of course you're surprised and startled. But  if it's nothing but that, it will pass away. And it will perhaps leave  something that I may not be ashamed of.\"    \"I don't know what it may leave. You see at all events that I'm not  overwhelmed,\" said Isabel with rather a pale smile. \"I'm not too  troubled to think. And I think that I'm glad I leave Rome to-morrow.\"    \"Of course I don't agree with you there.\"    \"I don't at all KNOW you,\" she added abruptly; and then she coloured as  she heard herself saying what she had said almost a year before to Lord  Warburton.    \"If you were not going away you'd know me better.\"    \"I shall do that some other time.\"    \"I hope so. I'm very easy to know.\"    \"No, no,\" she emphatically answered--\"there you're not sincere. You're  not easy to know; no one could be less so.\"    \"Well,\" he laughed, \"I said that because I know myself. It may be a  boast, but I do.\"    \"Very likely; but you're very wise.\"    \"So are you, Miss Archer!\" Osmond exclaimed.    \"I don't feel so just now. Still, I'm wise enough to think you had  better go. Good-night.\"    \"God bless you!\" said Gilbert Osmond, taking the hand which she failed  to surrender. After which he added: \"If we meet again you'll find me as  you leave me. If we don't I shall be so all the same.\"    \"Thank you very much. Good-bye.\"    There was something quietly firm about Isabel's visitor; he might go of  his own movement, but wouldn't be dismissed. \"There's one thing more.  I haven't asked anything of you--not even a thought in the future; you  must do me that justice. But there's a little service I should like to  ask. I shall not return home for several days; Rome's delightful, and  it's a good place for a man in my state of mind. Oh, I know you're sorry  to leave it; but you're right to do what your aunt wishes.\"    \"She doesn't even wish it!\" Isabel broke out strangely.    Osmond was apparently on the point of saying something that would match  these words, but he changed his mind and rejoined simply: \"Ah well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#3)"],[1,"waiter's hands. Well-wishers cleared the filled glasses away quickly and  Jason piled the chips onto the tray. They more than loaded it, but Kerk  appeared that moment with a second tray.    \"I'll be glad to help you, sir, if you will permit me,\" he said.    Jason looked at him, and laughed permission. It was the first time he  had a clear look at Kerk in the Casino. He was wearing loose, purple  evening pajamas over what must have been a false stomach. The sleeves  were long and baggy so he looked fat rather than muscular. It was a  simple but effective disguise.    [Illustration]    Carefully carrying the loaded trays, surrounded by a crowd of excited  patrons, they made their way to the cashier's window. The manager  himself was there, wearing a sickly grin. Even the grin faded when he  counted the chips.    \"Could you come back in the morning,\" he said, \"I'm afraid we don't have  that kind of money on hand.\"    \"What's the matter,\" Kerk shouted, \"trying to get out of paying him? You  took _my_ money easy enough when I lost--it works both ways!\"    The onlookers, always happy to see the house lose, growled their  disagreement. Jason finished the matter in a loud voice.    \"I'll be reasonable, give me what cash you have and I'll take a check  for the balance.\"    There was no way out. Under the watchful eye of the gleeful crowd the  manager packed an envelope with bills and wrote a check. Jason took a  quick glimpse at it, then stuffed it into an inside pocket. With the  envelope under one arm he followed Kerk towards the door.    Because of the onlookers there was no trouble in the main room, but just  as they reached the side entrance two men moved in, blocking the way.    \"Just a moment--\" one said. He never finished the sentence. Kerk walked  into them without slowing and they bounced away like tenpins. Then Kerk  and Jason were out of the building and walking fast.    \"Into the parking lot,\" Kerk said. \"I have a car there.\"    When they rounded the corner there was a car bearing down on them.  Before Jason could get his gun clear of the holster Kerk was in front of  him. His arm came up and his big ugly gun burst through the cloth of his  sleeve and jumped into his hand. A single shot killed the driver and the  car swerved and crashed. The other two men in the car died coming out of  the door, their guns dropping from their hands.    After that they had no trouble. Kerk drove at top speed away from the  Casino, the torn sleeve of his pajamas whipping in the breeze, giving  glimpses of the big gun back in the holster.    \"When you get the chance,\" Jason said, \"you'll have to show me how that  trick holster works.\"    \"When we get the chance,\" Kerk answered as he dived the car into the  city access tube.          III.      The building they stopped at was one of the finer residences in  Cassylia. As they had driven, Jason counted the money and separated his  share. Almost sixteen million credits. It still didn't seem quite real.  When they got out in front of the building he gave Kerk the rest.    \"Here's your three billion, don't think it was easy,\" he said.    \"It could have been worse,\" was his only answer.    The recorded voice scratched in the speaker over the door.    \"Sire Ellus has retired for the night, would you please call again in  the morning. All appointments are made in advan--\"    The voice broke off as Kerk pushed the door open. He did it almost  effortlessly with the flat of his hand. As they went in Jason looked at  the remnants of torn and twisted metal that hung in the lock and  wondered again about his companion.    _Strength--more than physical strength--he's like an elemental force. I  have the feeling that nothing can stop him._    It made him angry--and at the same time fascinated him. He didn't want  out of the deal until he found out more about Kerk and his planet. And  \"they\" who had died for the money he gambled.    Sire Ellus was old, balding and angry, not at all used to having his  rest disturbed. His complaints stopped suddenly when Kerk threw the  money down on the table.    \"Is the ship being loaded yet, Ellus? Here's the balance due.\" Ellus  only fumbled the bills for a moment before he could answer Kerk's  question.    \"The ship--but, of course. We began loading when you gave us the  deposit. You'll have to excuse my confusion, this is a little irregular.  We never handle transactions of this size in cash.\"    \"That's the way I like to do business,\" Kerk answered him, \"I've  canceled the deposit, this is the total sum. Now how about a receipt.\"    Ellus had made out the receipt before his senses returned. He held it  tightly while he looked uncomfortably at the three billion spread out  before him.    \"Wait--I can't take it now, you'll have to return in the morning, to the  bank. In normal business fashion,\" Ellus decided firmly.    Kerk reached over and gently drew the paper out of Ellus' hand.    \"Thanks for the receipt,\" he said. \"I won't be here in the morning so  this will be satisfactory. And if you're worried about the money I  suggest you get in touch with some of your plant guards or private  police. You'll feel a lot safer.\"    When they left through the shattered door Ellus was frantically dialing  numbers on his screen. Kerk answered Jason's next question before he  could ask it.    \"I imagine you would like to live to spend that money in your pocket, so  I've booked two seats on an interplanetary ship,\" he glanced at the car  clock. \"It leaves in about two hours so we have plenty of time. I'm  hungry, let's find a restaurant. I hope you have nothing at the hotel  worth going back for. It would be a little difficult.\"    \"Nothing worth getting killed for,\" Jason said. \"Now where can we go to  eat--there are a few questions I would like to ask you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They circled carefully down to the transport levels until they were sure  they hadn't been followed. Kerk nosed the car into a darkened loading  dock where they abandoned it.    \"We can always get another car,\" he said, \"and they probably have this  one spotted. Let's walk back to the freightway, I saw a restaurant there  as we came by.\"    Dark and looming shapes of overland freight carriers filled the parking  lot. They picked their way around the man-high wheels and into the hot  and noisy restaurant. The drivers and early morning workers took no  notice of them as they found a booth in the back and dialed a meal.    Kerk chiseled a chunk of meat off the slab in front of him and popped it  cheerfully into his mouth. \"Ask your questions,\" he said. \"I'm feeling  much better already.\"    \"What's in this ship you arranged for tonight--what kind of a cargo was  I risking my neck for?\"    \"I thought you were risking your neck for money,\" Kerk said dryly. \"But  be assured it was in a good cause. That cargo means the survival of a  world. Guns, ammunition, mines, explosives and such.\"    Jason choked over a mouthful of food. \"Gun-running! What are you doing,  financing a private war? And how can you talk about survival with a  lethal cargo like that? Don't try and tell me they have a peaceful use.  Who are you killing?\"    Most of the big man's humor had vanished, he had that grim look Jason  knew well.    \"Yes, peaceful would be the right word. Because that is basically all we  want. Just to live in peace. And it is not _who_ are we killing--it is  _what_ we are killing.\"    Jason pushed his plate away with an angry gesture. \"You're talking in  riddles,\" he said. \"What you say has no meaning.\"    \"It has meaning enough,\" Kerk told him, \"but only on one planet in the  universe. Just how much do you know about Pyrrus?\"    \"Absolutely nothing.\"    For a moment Kerk sat wrapped in memory, scowling distantly. Then he  went on.    \"Mankind doesn't belong on Pyrrus--yet has been there for almost three  hundred years now. The age expectancy of my people is sixteen years. Of  course most adults live beyond that, but the high child mortality brings  the average down.    \"It is everything that a humanoid world should not be. The gravity is  nearly twice Earth normal. The temperature can vary daily from arctic to  tropic. The climate--well you have to experience it to believe it. Like  nothing you've seen anywhere else in the galaxy.\"    \"I'm frightened,\" Jason said dryly. \"What do you have--methane or  chlorine reactions? I've been down on planets like that--\"           *       *       *       *       *    Kerk slammed his hand down hard on the table. The dishes bounced and the  table legs creaked. \"Laboratory reactions!\" he growled. \"They look great  on a bench--but what happens when you have a world filled with those  compounds? In an eye-wink of galactic time all the violence is locked up  in nice, stable compounds. The atmosphere may be poisonous for an oxygen  breather, but taken by itself it's as harmless as weak beer.    \"There is only one setup that is pure poison as a planetary atmosphere.  Plenty of H{2}O, the most universal solvent you can find, plus free  oxygen to work on--\"    \"Water and oxygen!\" Jason broke in. \"You mean Earth--or a planet like  Cassylia here? That's preposterous.\"    \"Not at all. Because you were born in this kind of environment you  accept it as right and natural. You take it for granted that metals  corrode, coastlines change, and storms interfere with communication.  These are normal occurrences on oxygen-water worlds. On Pyrrus these  conditions are carried to the nth degree.    \"The planet has an axial tilt of almost forty-two degrees, so there is a  tremendous change in temperature from season to season. This is one of  the prime causes of a constantly changing icecap. The weather generated  by this is spectacular to say the least.\"    \"If that's all,\" Jason said, \"I don't see why--\"    \"That's _not_ all--it's barely the beginning. The open seas perform the  dual destructive function of supplying water vapor to keep the weather  going, and"]]]
