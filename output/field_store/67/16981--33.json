The souring of milk, the formation of butyric acid,  the making of vinegar from cider, are all examples of fermentative  changes.    With many bacteria, especially those that affect proteid matter,  foul-smelling gases are formed. These are known as putrefactive changes.  All organic matter, under the action of various organisms, sooner or  later undergoes decay, and in different stages of these processes,  acids, alkalies, gases and numerous other products are formed. Many of  these changes in organic matter occur only when such material is brought  in direct contact with the living bacterial cell.    In other instances, soluble, non-vital ferments known as _enzyms_ are  produced by the living cell, which are able to act on organic matter, in  a medium free from live cells, or under conditions where the activity of  the cell is wholly suspended. These enzyms are not confined to bacteria  but are found throughout the animal and plant world, especially in those  processes that are concerned in digestion. Among the better known of  these non-vital ferments are rennet, the milk-curdling enzym; diastase  or ptyalin of the saliva, the starch-converting enzym; pepsin and  trypsin, the digestive ferments of the animal body.    Enzyms of these types are frequently found among the bacteria and yeasts  and it is by virtue of this characteristic that these organisms are  able to break down such enormous quantities of organic matter. Most of  these enzyms react toward heat, cold and chemical poisons in a manner  quite similar to the living cells. In one respect they are readily  differentiated, and that is, that practically all of them are capable of  producing their characteristic chemical transformations under  anaesthetic conditions, as in a saturated ether or chloroform  atmosphere.    ~Distribution of bacteria.~ As bacteria possess greater powers of  resistance than most other forms of life, they are to be found more  widely distributed than any other type. At the surface of the earth,  where conditions permit of their growth, they are found everywhere,  except in the healthy tissues of animals and plants. In the superficial  soil layers, they exist in myriads, as here they have abundance of  nourishment. At the depth of several feet however, they diminish rapidly  in numbers, and in the deeper soil layers, from six to ten feet or more,  they are not present, because of the unsuitable growth conditions.    The bacteria are found in the air because of their development in the  soil below. They are unable to grow even in a moist atmosphere, but are  so readily dislodged by wind currents that over land areas the lower  strata of the air always contain them. They are more numerous in summer  than in winter; city air contains larger numbers than country air.  Wherever dried fecal matter is present, as in barns, the air contains  many forms.    Water contains generally enough organic matter in solution, so that  certain types of bacterial life find favorable growth conditions. Water  in contact with the soil surface takes up many impurities, and is of  necessity rich in microbes. As the rain water percolates into the soil,  it loses its germ content, so that the normal ground water, like the  deeper soil layers, contains practically no bacterial life. Springs  therefore are relatively deficient in germ life, except as they become  infected with soil organisms, as the water issues from the soil. Water  may serve to disseminate certain infectious diseases as typhoid fever  and cholera among human beings, and a number of animal maladies.    While the inner tissues of healthy animals are free from bacteria, the  natural passages as the respiratory and digestive tracts, being in more  direct contact with the exterior, become more readily infected. This is  particularly true with reference to the intestinal tract, for in the  undigested residue, bacterial activity is at a maximum. The result is  that fecal matter contains enormous numbers of organisms so that the  possibility of pollution of any food medium such as milk with such  material is sure to introduce elements that seriously affect the quality  of the product.          CHAPTER II.    METHODS OF STUDYING BACTERIA.      ~Necessity of bacterial masses for study.~ The bacteria are so extremely  small that it is impossible to study individual germs separately without  the aid of first-class microscopes. For this reason, but little advance  was made in the knowledge of these lower forms of plant life, until the  introduction of culture methods, whereby a single organism could be  cultivated and the progeny of this cell increased to such an extent in a  short course of time, that they would be visible to the unaided eye.    This is done by growing the bacteria in masses on various kinds of food  media that are prepared for the purpose, but inasmuch as bacteria are so  universally distributed, it becomes an impossibility to cultivate any  special form, unless the medium in which they are grown is first freed  from all pre-existing forms of germ life. To accomplish this, it is  necessary to subject the nutrient medium to some method of  sterilization, such as heat or filtration, whereby all life is  completely destroyed or eliminated. Such material after it has been  rendered germ-free is kept in sterilized glass tubes and flasks, and is  protected from infection by cotton stoppers.    ~Culture media.~ For culture media, many different substances are  employed. In fact, bacteria will grow on almost any organic substance  whether it is solid or fluid, provided the other essential conditions of  growth are furnished. The food substances that are used for culture  purposes are divided into two classes; solids and liquids.    Solid media may be either permanently solid like potatoes, or they may  retain their solid properties only at certain temperatures like gelatin  or agar. The latter two are of utmost importance in bacteriological  research, for their use, which was introduced by Koch, permits the  separation of the different forms that may happen to be in any mixture.  Gelatin is used advantageously because the majority of bacteria present  wider differences due to growth upon this medium than upon any other. It  remains solid at ordinary temperatures, becoming liquid at about 70 deg.   F. Agar, a gelatinous product derived from a Japanese sea-weed, has a much  higher melting point, and can be successfully used, especially with  those organisms whose optimum growth point is above the melting point of  gelatin.    Besides these solid media, different liquid substances are extensively  used, such as beef broth, milk, and infusions of various vegetable and  animal tissues. Skim-milk is of especial value in studying the milk  bacteria and may be used in its natural condition, or a few drops of  litmus solution may be added in order to detect any change in its  chemical reaction due to the bacteria.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. A gelatin plate culture showing appearance of  different organisms in a sample of milk. Each mass represents a  bacterial growth (colony) derived from a single cell. Different forms  react differently toward the gelatin, some liquefying the same, others  growing in a restricted mass. _a_, represents a colony of the ordinary  bread mold; _b_, a liquefying bacterium; _c_, and _d_, solid forms.]    ~Methods of isolation.~ Suppose for instance one wishes to isolate the  different varieties of bacteria found in milk. The method of procedure  is as follows: Sterile gelatin in glass tubes is melted and cooled down  so as to be barely warm. To this gelatin which is germ-free a drop of  milk is added. The gelatin is then gently shaken so as to thoroughly  distribute the milk particles, and poured out into a sterile flat glass  dish and quickly covered. This is allowed to stand on a cool surface  until the gelatin hardens. After the culture plate has been left for  twenty-four to thirty-six hours at the proper temperature, tiny spots  will begin to appear on the surface, or in the depth of the culture  medium. These patches are called _colonies_ and are composed of an  almost infinite number of individual germs, the result of the continued  growth of a single organism that was in the drop of milk which was  firmly held in place when the gelatin solidified. The number of these  colonies represents approximately the number of germs that were present  in the milk drop. If the plate is not too thickly sown with these germs,  the colonies will continue to grow and increase in size, and as they do,  minute differences will begin to appear. These differences may be in the  color, the contour and the texture of the colony, or the manner in  which it acts toward gelatin. In order to make sure that the seeding in  not too copious so as to interfere with continued study, an  _attenuation_ is usually made. This consists in taking a drop of the  infected gelatin in the first tube, and transferring it to another tube  of sterile media. Usually this operation is repeated again so that these  culture plates are made with different amounts of seed with the  expectation that in at least one plate the seeding will not be so thick  as to prevent further study. For transferring the culture a loop made of  platinum wire is used. By passing this through a gas flame, it can be  sufficiently sterilized.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Profile view of gelatin plate culture; _b_, a  liquefying form that dissolves the gelatin; _c_ and _d_, surface  colonies that do not liquefy the gelatin.]    To further study the peculiarities of different germs, the separate  colonies are transferred to other sterile tubes of culture material and  thus _pure cultures_ of the various germs are secured.

There is something hospitable in  laying them open to public use; and while we share in their pleasures,  we have no title to arraign their taste.\"    The chief attraction of Lincoln's Inn gardens, apart from its beautiful  trees, was for many years the terrace overlooking 'the Fields,' which  was made _temp._ Car. II. at the cost of nearly L1000. Dugdale, speaking  of the recent improvements of the Inn, says, \"And the last was the  enlargement of their garden, beautifying with a large tarras walk on the  west side thereof, and raising the wall higher towards Lincoln's Inne  Fields, which was done in An. 1663 (15 Car. II.), the charge thereof  amounting to a little less than a thousand pounds, by reason that the  levelling of most part of the ground, and raising the tarras, required  such great labor.\" A portion of this terrace, and some of the old trees,  were destroyed to make room for the new dining-hall.    The old system supplied the barrister with other sources of recreation.  Within a stone's throw of his residence was the hotel where his club had  its weekly meeting. Either in hall, or with his family, or at a tavern  near 'the courts,' it was his use, until a comparatively recent date, to  dine in the middle of the day, and work again after the meal. Courts sat  after dinner as well as before; and it was observable that counsellors  spoke far better when they were full of wine and venison than when they  stated the case in the earlier part of the day. But in the evening the  system told especially in the barrister's favor. All his many friends  lying within a small circle, he had an abundance of congenial society.  Brother-circuiteers came to his wife's drawing-room for tea and chat,  coffee and cards. There was a substantial supper at half-past eight or  nine for such guests (supper cooked in my lady's little kitchen, or  supplied by the 'Society's cook'); and the smoking dishes were  accompanied by foaming tankards of ale or porter, and followed by  superb and richly aromatic bowls of punch. On occasions when the learned  man worked hard and shut out visitors by sporting his oak, he enjoyed  privacy as unbroken and complete as that of any library in Kensington or  Tyburnia. If friends stayed away, and he wished for diversion, he could  run into the chambers of old college-chums, or with his wife's gracious  permission could spend an hour at Chatelin's or Nando's, or any other  coffeehouse in vogue with members of his profession. During festive  seasons, when the judges' and leaders' ladies gave their grand balls,  the young couple needed no carriage for visiting purposes. From Gray's  Inn to the Temple they walked--if the weather was fine. When it rained  they hailed a hackney-coach, or my lady was popped into a sedan and  carried by running bearers to the frolic of the hour.    Of course the notes of the preceding paragraphs of this chapter are but  suggestions as to the mode in which the artistic reader must call up the  life of the old lawyers. Encouraging him to realize the manners and  usages of several centuries, not of a single generation, they do not  attempt to entertain the student with details. It is needless to say  that the young couple did not use hackney-coaches in times prior to the  introduction of those serviceable vehicles, and that until sedans were  invented my lady never used them.    It is possible, indeed it is certain, that married ladies living in  chambers occasionally had for neighbors on the same staircase women whom  they regarded with abhorrence. Sometimes it happened that a dissolute  barrister introduced to his rooms a woman more beautiful than virtuous,  whom he had not married, though he called her his wife. People can no  more choose their neighbors in a house broken up into sets of chambers,  than they can choose them in the street. But the cases where ladies  were daily liable to meet an offensive neighbor on their common  staircase were comparatively rare; and when the annoyance actually  occurred, the discipline of the Inn afforded a remedy.    Uncleanness too often lurked within the camp, but it veiled its face;  and though in rare cases the error and sin of a powerful lawyer may have  been notorious, the preccant man was careful to surround himself with  such an appearance of respectability that society should easily feign  ignorance of his offence. An Elizabethan distich--familiar to all  barristers, but too rudely worded for insertion in this page--informs us  that in the sixteenth century Gray's Inn had an unenviable notoriety  amongst legal hospices for the shamelessness of its female inmates. But  the pungent lines must be regarded as a satire aimed at certain  exceptional members, rather than as a vivacious picture of the general  tone of morals in the society. Anyhow the fact that Gray's Inn[1] was  alone designated as a home for infamy--whilst the Inner Temple was  pointed to as the hospice most popular with rich men, the Middle Temple  as the society frequented by Templars of narrow means, and Lincoln's Inn  as the abode of gentlemen--is, of itself, a proof that the pervading  manners of the last three institutions were outwardly decorous. Under  the least favorable circumstances, a barrister's wife living in  chambers, within or near Lincoln's Inn, or the Temple, during Charles  II.'s reign, fared as well in this respect as she would have done had  Fortune made her a lady-in-waiting at Whitehall.    A good story is told of certain visits paid to William Murray's chambers  at No. 5, King's Bench Walk Temple, in the year 1738. Born in 1705,  Murray was still a young man when in 1738 he made his brilliant speech  in behalf of Colonel Sloper, against whom Colley Cibber's rascally son  had brought an action for _crim. con._ with his wife--the lovely actress  who was the rival of Mrs. Clive. Amongst the many clients who were drawn  to Murray by that speech, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, was neither the  least powerful nor the least distinguished. Her grace began by sending  the rising advocate a general retainer, with a fee of a thousand  guineas; of which sum he accepted only the two-hundredth part,  explaining to the astonished duchess that \"the professional fee, with a  general retainer, could neither be less nor more than five guineas.\" If  Murray had accepted the whole sum he would not have been overpaid for  his trouble; for her grace persecuted him with calls at most  unseasonable hours. On one occasion, returning to his chambers after  \"drinking champagne with the wits,\" he found the duchess's carriage and  attendants on King's Bench Walk. A numerous crowd of footmen and  link-bearers surrounded the coach; and when the barrister entered his  chambers he encountered the mistress of that army of lackeys. \"Young  man,\" exclaimed the grand lady, eying the future Lord Mansfield with a  look of warm displeasure, \"if you mean to rise in the world, you must  not sup out.\" On a subsequent night Sarah of Marlborough called without  appointment at the same chambers, and waited till past midnight in the  hope that she would see the lawyer ere she went to bed. But Murray being  at an unusually late supper-party, did not return till her grace had  departed in an over-powering rage. \"I could not make out, sir, who she  was,\" said Murray's clerk, describing her grace's appearance and manner,  \"for she would not tell me her name; _but she swore so dreadfully that I  am sure she must be a lady of quality_.\"    Perhaps the Inns of Court may still shelter a few married ladies, who  either from love of old-world ways, or from stern necessity, consent to  dwell in their husbands' chambers. If such ladies can at the present  time be found, the writer of this page would look for them in Gray's  Inn--that straggling caravansary for the reception of money-lenders,  Bohemians, and eccentric gentlemen--rather than in the other three Inns  of Court, which have undoubtedly quite lost their old population of  lady-residents. But from those three hospices the last of the ladies  must have retreated at a comparatively recent date. Fifteen years since,  when the writer of this book was a beardless undergraduate, he had the  honor of knowing some married ladies, of good family and unblemished  repute, who lived with their husbands in the Middle Temple. One of those  ladies--the daughter of a country magistrate, the sister of a  distinguished classic scholar--was the wife of a common law barrister  who now holds a judicial appointment in one of our colonies. The women  of her old home circle occasionally called on this young wife: but as  they could not reach her quarters in Sycamore Court without attracting  much unpleasant observation, their visits were not frequent. Living in a  barrack of unwed men, that charming girl was surrounded by honest  fellows who would have resented as an insult to themselves an  impertinence offered to her. Still her life was abnormal, unnatural,  deleterious; it was felt by all who cared for her that she ought not to  be where she was; and when an appointment with a good income in a  healthy and thriving colony was offered to her husband, all who knew  her, and many who had never spoken to her, rejoiced at the intelligence.  At the present time, in the far distant country which looks up to her  as a personage of importance, this lady--not less exemplary as wife and  mother than brilliant as a woman of society--takes pleasure in recalling  the days when she was a prisoner in the Temple.    One of the last cases of married life in the Temple, that came before  the public notice, was that of a barrister and his wife who incurred  obloquy and punishment for their brutal conduct to a poor servant girl.
