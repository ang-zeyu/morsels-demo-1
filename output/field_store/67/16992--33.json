THE ORTHODOXY OF ATHEISM AND INGERSOLISM, BY REV. S. L. TYRRELL.      \"Hail human liberty; there is no God!\" Such is the exulting song of many a  human heart when bewildering metaphysics or superficial science has  crowded from its convictions faith in the Deity and his moral government.  Few men have reached the pure, unclouded heights of religion and morality,  where the unselfish love of the holy and the right, for their own inherent  excellence, forms the controlling motive of their conduct, regardless of  penalty or reward. Humanity is yet on the low moral plane, where penal  laws, human or divine, are the most potent forces in regulating human  life. Hence the sad fact appears that when theism seems most successfully  assailed we hear from many quarters ill-concealed rustlings of exultation  at the welcome loosening of the bonds of morality and religion. It seems  to be overlooked that a very stern theological system may be quite  rationally evolved from atheistic premises; and there is now a new and  very tempting field inviting some bold Calvin or Luther in the ranks of  positivism to write an immortal book, with the original and attractive  title, Ethics of Atheism. The great offense of the scientific (sciolistic)  atheist is his lofty arrogance. He complacently assumes the name of  Infallible Wisdom. He \"understands all mysteries;\" his mental telescope  sweeps eternity \"from everlasting to everlasting;\" his microscopic vision  pierces the secrets of creation,--sees the beauty and order of all  celestial worlds emerge from fiery chaotic dust,--by the fortunate contact  of cooling cinders of the right chemical properties and temperature, he  secretes and hatches into life an egg, or cell of throbbing protoplasm; to  this pulsating mass of jelly there comes from the unconscious abyss at  length a vague instinct, a drowsy awakening of desire; next a feeble gleam  of definite thought; reason then faintly dawns, and lo! at last this fair  universe burst into glorious light, clothed in surpassing loveliness,  throbbing with love, tender sympathy and sublime aspiration, and all  through the magic potency of blind matter and unconscious force, without  an architect or guide. O, wondrous matter, could a God do more?    O, divine science (sciolist), we bless thy name; thou hast delivered us  from the terrors of dogmatic fear! Man is but dust, and unto dust shall he  return; \"let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" But ere we run riot  in the intoxication of our new-born freedom from divine law, does not the  skeptical, cautious, scientific spirit admonish us to pause a moment and  look logically at another class of possible achievements of this  wonder-working, material power. In philosophical researches, analogy is a  recognized and legitimate guide to truth. Admitting, then, that pure  matter has done all that materialism claims it has done in the past, let  us look by the light of analogy at other and graver possibilities it may  have wrought in its reckless, unrestrained creations. Time is a mighty  attribute of evolutionary divinities; its power seems next to infinite. In  a few millions of years Alexanders, Bonapartes, Bismarks, Miltons, Edisons  and Ingersols have been evolved from thoughtless chaos; now, if in limited  time (for what are millions of years to eternity) such majestic mental  forces have been developed from the inexhaustible store-house of  _intellectual nothingness_, why should bold mathematical science deem it a  \"thing incredible\" that in an eternity of time, with an unlimited amount  of matter for capital and infinite space for a theater of action, this  mind-evolving force may not have generated beings of almost infinite  capacities--even a monarch who sways a scepter over more worlds than  one--EVEN A GOD. Why should material philosophy cavil at the creeds which  teach a righteous judgment to come? Have not the judicial elements of  oxygen, carbon and hydrogen combined to organize on one planet at least  courts of equity and judgment seats, and crystalized into prison walls and  hand-cuffs the gallows and the hangman? Upon the established scientific  principle that nature's laws are uniform, undeviating and universal in  their action, does not the analogy of earthly tribunals logically  necessitate the belief that our globe is but a province of the infinite  empire governed by righteous laws, of which enlightened human laws are a  partial revelation.    Modern science teaches the oneness of the universe and the identity and  sameness of the matter composing it. What then can be more strictly  scientific and demonstrable from materialistic premises than the vast  conclusion that uniform passive matter, operated upon by the same  undeviating laws, must in all worlds produce the same results and evolve,  as it has on our planet, intelligence in which a sense of right and  justice shall predominate, and everywhere and in all time, enact and  execute laws discriminating between right and wrong? What astronomical  prediction, then, can be more certain of fulfillment than this moral  prophecy of the final eclipse of evil and ultimate triumph of the right?  With no existing power to arrest or mitigate the sentence of this  relentless, carboniferous judge, how fearful may be the possible fate of  those who disregard the moral laws of protoplasm. Matter has evolved a  Franklin and a Morse, who learned to wield the lightning's power. Why may  there not have been evolved in the infinite past a more profound  electrician, who, with his battery and etherial wires can shiver a planet  with his touch? A marvelous power--the human spirit--has gained a vast  control over the blind, stubborn substances and forces that created it,  and by its immaterial, invisible will, can in a limited degree overrule  the most imperious law of nature by throwing a stone into the air. Is it  unscientific, then, or derogatory to the vaunted potency of matter to  affirm that the eternal ages may have developed an intelligent will that  can project a planet or sun, as the human will and muscle project the  pebble? Scoff not, exalted sages, at the weak terrors of those who tremble  at the dogma of a malignant devil; consider that pity and compassion are  not the known chemical constituents of this soulless creator. Where, then,  can we fix the limit of that unconscious, fiendish force that evolved a  Nero, and incarnated in human bodies the myriads of demoniac spirits that  walk the earth to-day? Egotistical scientist (sciolist) calm the cyclone,  quiet the engulphing earthquake, blot from human history the records of  war, pestilence, famine, the tales of St. Bartholomew and the Inquisition,  and then deny by material philosophy the possibility of even a Calvinistic  hell; deny the personality of man because your microscope and scalpel can  not find a soul by dissecting the brain of the mathematician, and then  deny a personal God because his spirit eludes the grasp of sealed  crucibles and can not be detected by digging in the earth with the spade.  Deny the existence of conscious life, and then in the light of reason and  science deny that the forces that generate life must from necessary law  work for its continuance and immortality. Extreme materialism confidently  teaches the birth, death and resurrection of planetary universes; why  should such grand faith stagger at the theory of the resurrection of a  soul? Where is the scientific absurdity of Renan's distant hope, that this  mighty resurrection of dead worlds will embrace in its infinite scope the  awakening to consciousness; the universal past consciousness of the  universe. May not both theist and atheist find in this line of thought a  partial answer to the oft recurring modern prayer, \"Help thou mine  unbelief.\"--_From the Religio-Philosophic Journal._            Can you believe that all things are the result of blind, unintelligent  forces, operating under mechanical laws?            THE SHASTERS AND VEDAS, AND THE CHINESE, GOVERNMENT, RELIGION, ETC.      Men who wish to be known as scientific skeptics and unbelievers often  boast that the above-mentioned books are more worthy of respect than the  books of the Bible. For the benefit of all who may not have access to  those books, the following, from Duff's India, credited to the Shasters,  may be of service in the search after truth:    \"Brahm produced an egg. All the primary atoms, qualities, and principles,  the seeds of future worlds, that had been evolved from the substance of  Brahm, were now collected together and deposited in the newly produced  egg. And into it, along with them, entered the self-existent himself,  under the assumed form of Brahma; and then he sat vivifying, expanding,  and combining the elements, during four thousand three hundred millions of  solar years. During this amazing period the wondrous egg floated like a  bubble on the water, increasing constantly in size. At length the supreme,  who dwelt therein, burst the shell of the stupendous egg and issued forth  under a new form with a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand  arms. Along with him issued another form, huge and measureless, which  speedily matured into the present glorious universe.\"--_Shasters._    In Hindostan we may see on one hand the trident of Neptune, the eagle of  Jupiter, the satyrs of Bacchus, the bow of Cupid and the chariot of the  Sun; on the other, we hear the cymbals of Rhea, the songs of the Muses,  and the pastoral tales of Apollo Nomius. The Hindoos enumerate four grand  periods in the world's history called _yugs_. The first comprehends one  million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand years. The second, one  million two hundred and ninety-six thousand; the third, eight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#3)"],[1," Bible teaches us that the institution is of Divine origin, established  by the Lord himself. It inscribes upon every marriage altar, \"What God  hath joined together let no man put asunder.\" It definitely defines  marriage to be the act of uniting two persons in wedlock, and only two.  According to the Scriptures, this union can only be dissolved by crime or  death. With great tenderness the Bible prescribes the duties of this  relation. \"Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.\" This love  is not the cold hearted affection that is after the fashion of free-love  philosophy, but it is after a model that has touched heavenly hearts, and  caused more admiration than all other things combined.    In the ancient dispensation adultery was punished with death. In the  Christian dispensation, it is said with _great emphasis_, \"Whoremongers  and adulterers God will judge.\" There is a place of which it is said,  \"Whoso is simple let him turn in hither, but he knoweth not that the dead  are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.\" There is a sin  of which the Bible often speaks, pointing the guilty perpetrators to the  fact that they have none inheritance in the kingdom of God and of Christ.    The history of Pagan nations is little else than a record of crime. By  studying it we may learn something of our obligations to the Christian  religion, and our indebtedness to its pure spirit, which has brooded over  the darkness of the nations, and brought order out of confusion. It will,  also, learn us to value the names father, mother, husband, wife, children  and parents; these names were of little value among Romans. In the annals  of the Roman empire may be found a record of all that is shocking; a  record of all that man can be guilty of; a record of all that an enemy  could be guilty of; suspicion, licentiousness, murder, conspiracy of wives  against their husbands, and husbands against their wives; children  sacrificed by the doings of a mother; families whose peace is ruined by  intrigue and violence; men everywhere falling upon their own swords; the  wife murdering her own husband for the sake of marrying another; woman  practiced, skilled, in the art of poisoning--such is the picture of Pagan  life in the most enlightened age of Rome.    Let any man compare society in our country, or in any protestant country,  with the state of society under the reign of the Caesars, and he will see  what the Christ has done for our race. The spirit that sustains our social  institutions does not grow cold even at the grave, but is felt beyond  death. How is it in heathen lands? The sweetest loves of life give way to  suspicion and envy; the jealousy of love, the thirst for power and  ambition, drives them away, often as soon as the flowers and beauty of  youth are gone. Where Christ reigns it is not so. Yet there are those who  would have us believe that the religion of Christ is an unsocial, selfish  religion. If it is unsocial and selfish to have no sympathy with  wickedness, to promote all that is virtuous and kind, pure and true, to  take pleasure in all that subdues the malignant and beastly, the ambitious  and cruel, then it is an unsocial and selfish affair. If it is unsocial  and selfish to take pleasure in that which elevates and moulds character  in the image of God, and fits it for angelic society hereafter, then it is  truly unsocial and selfish.            LAW, CAUSE, AND AGENT.      The word law denotes the unceasing, regular order in which an agent or  force operates. It should, consequently, be distinguished from cause or  efficiency; it being only the manner, or mode, according to which an agent  or cause manifests itself. Therefore law is neither cause or agent. Yet it  implies an agent, or an energy; for without these law is nothing--does  nothing. The laws of nature had no existence until nature existed. That is  to say, the laws of water did not exist until water existed, etc. So it is  easy to perceive the truth that the laws of nature created nothing. Nature  is said to be the aggregate of everything; therefore nature created  nothing. The laws of nature, being the rules according to which effects  are produced, demonstrate the existence of a cause or agent which  operates. As the rules of navigation never steered a ship, so the law of  gravity never moved a planet. A bare order or law of nature was not the  cause of nature. To confound order or law with cause is to speak  unadvisedly--unintelligently; it is perfectly irrational. Would you cut off  executive authority in a government and continue its existence without a  person or society to exercise, judge and execute according to law?    To say the world is governed by the laws of nature, without rising up in  our thoughts to the efficient cause and superior reason, or, that which is  always implied in the term law, viz., a legislator and executive putting  in force, is to play the Atheist and take things by halves; is to suppose  the laws of nature are beings, and imagine fabulous divinities in ignoring  or setting aside the Christian's God, who is the source of all the laws of  nature, and who governs all things according to them. \"The laws of nature  are the art of God.\" Without the presence of such an agent--one who is  conscious of all upon which the laws of nature depend--producing all that  the laws prescribe--the laws themselves could have no existence. The  intelligence, or, if you prefer it, cause, which gives the laws of nature  their power, and by which they are kept in action, must be everywhere  present and always present; otherwise the whole machinery of nature would  be deranged--inertia is a property of matter. The universal presence of God  is the one great and overwhelming condition of the existence of life and  motion throughout the vast universe of nature. The laws of matter are the  laws which he has prescribed for his own action. His presence is the  essential condition of any natural course of events in the history of  matter. His universal agency is the only organ of power adequate to the  accomplishment of the wonders of nature--the only solution of its great  problems which lies within the reach of human reason. Some fools still say  in their hearts there is no God.    One of Newton's great laws of motion is, that a body must continue forever  in a state of rest, inertia being a property of matter, or being put in  motion continues forever in a straight line, if it be not disturbed by the  action of an _external_ cause.    Now let us apply this law to our planet, as a body, and see the result.  What is the first necessary conclusion to which we are driven? Ans. Some  external agency or cause put our planet in motion. What is the second  conclusion? Ans. Some agent or cause controls its motion causing it to  depart from a straight line. Do you say the cause is in the influence of  other planets? Well, suppose, for the sake of the argument, we admit it,  are we then through with the problem? No. We have only moved the  difficulty one step backward. We can see how one billiard ball may set  another in motion, but it is only thinkable upon the supposition that  there was an agent behind the ball which put the second ball in motion.  What put the first ball in motion? Did it put itself in motion? No. The  law is this: A body must remain forever at rest without some external  agency to put it in motion. Now, you step out from our planet to its  nearest neighbor, and from thence to the next, and so on till you get to  the furthest limits of matter--carry along with you the idea that one  planet has put another in motion until you arrive at the last one  thinkable, and then ask yourself this question: Is inertia a property of  matter here? Is the law of motion, already quoted, a law of motion here?  If it is, then, of necessity, science demands an agent outside of planets,  or behind the whole of them, to put them in motion, and to control them  while in motion in order to carry them forward in _circles_--do you see?  \"But the fool says in his heart there is no God.\"            THE INCONSISTENCY OF MODERN UNBELIEVERS OR MATERIALISTS.      The materialistic unbeliever is necessarily bound up in a contradiction  from which there is no escape short of a denial of the eternity of matter,  space and duration, on the one hand, or a denial of the materialistic  philosophy, upon the other.    His reasoning is this: Space exists. I know it exists. I can't set bounds  to space, therefore it is infinite.    Matter exists. I know it exists. I can't annihilate matter, therefore  matter is eternal.    Duration is. I know it is. I can't set limits to it; therefore duration is  infinite.    Now, it is easy to discover that the conclusion in each case rests upon  two thoughts. First, Conscious knowledge expressed in the phrase \"I know.\"  Secondly, Want of power to set bounds to space, to limit duration and  annihilate matter.    The other and contrary side is brought up in the following arrangement:  Mind exists. I know it exists. I can't set limits to mind; therefore mind  is infinite, mind is eternal.    Life exists. I can't comprehend or set limits to life; therefore life is  infinite, life is eternal.    The time was when there was no life or mind associated with or in matter,  the matter belonging to our planet. From whence came life? From whence  came mind? Do you say from the laws of nature? Well, laws are rules by  which agents act. Laws are nothing unless there is an agent to act in  harmony with them or by them. There is consequently something lying behind  the laws of nature, acting by them. What is that something? Do you say it  is force? Force is the manifestation of energy--a mere attribute. There is  something behind energy, to which it belongs. Do you say it is matter?  Inertia is a property of matter? From whence came life and mind? The time  was when they were not here.    You unbelievers say it is"]]]
