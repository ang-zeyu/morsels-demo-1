With regard to my own private feelings, as  it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing.    For the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader  is referred to the Notes.    The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other  to approach, the \"unities;\" conceiving that with any very distant  departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is  aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature;  but it is not a system of his own, being merely an opinion, which, not  very long ago, was the law of literature throughout the world, and is  still so in the more civilised parts of it. But \"nous avons change tout  cela,\" and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far  from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or  example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors:  he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation  of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules  whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and  not in the art.    In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of  Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity  as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose  the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy,  instead of the long war of the history.

SARDANAPALUS.[5]                                        ACT I.                          SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Palace_.          _Salemenes_ (_solus_).      He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;      He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;      He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--      And I must be his friend as well as subject:      He must not perish thus. I will not see      The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis      Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years      Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;      He must be roused. In his effeminate heart      There is a careless courage which Corruption                        10      Has not all quenched, and latent energies,      Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--      Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.      If born a peasant, he had been a man      To have reached an empire: to an empire born,      He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,      Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--      Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem      His sloth and shame, by only being that      Which he should be, as easily as the thing                          20      He should not be and is. Were it less toil      To sway his nations than consume his life?      To head an army than to rule a harem?      He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,[a]      And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not      Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--      He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound                                   [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.      To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--      The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings      Of lulling instruments, the softening voices                        30      Of women, and of beings less than women,      Must chime in to the echo of his revel,      While the great King of all we know of earth      Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem      Lies negligently by to be caught up      By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.      Lo, where they come! already I perceive      The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,      And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,[b]      At once his Chorus and his Council, flash                           40      Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,      As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,      The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--      He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,      And tell him what all good men tell each other,      Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves      Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.                                      SCENE II.               _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head           crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,               attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.        _Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).      Let the pavilion[6] over the Euphrates      Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth      For an especial banquet; at the hour      Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,      And bid the galley be prepared. There is      A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:      We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign      To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,      We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,      When we shall gather like the stars above us,                       10      And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;      Till then, let each be mistress of her time,      And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha,[7] choose;      Wilt thou along with them or me?        _Myr._                          My Lord--        _Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?      It is the curse of kings to be so answered.      Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou      Accompany our guests, or charm away      The moments from me?        _Myr._              The King's choice is mine.        _Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20      Is to contribute to thine every wish.      I do not dare to breathe my own desire,      Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still      Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.        _Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness      Save in beholding thine; yet--        _Sar._                         Yet! what YET?      Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier      Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.        _Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour      Of council; it were better I retire.                                30        _Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)      The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.        _Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?        _Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,      And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.        _Sar._ (_addressing his train_).      As I have said, let all dispose their hours      Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.                                                      [_The court retiring_.      (_To_ MYRRHA,[c] _who is going_.)      Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.        _Myr._                                  Great King,      Thou didst not say so.        _Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:      I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]      Which said thou wouldst not leave me.        _Myr._                               Sire! your brother----        _Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40      How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?        _Sar._                                    Not blush!      Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson      Like to the dying day on Caucasus,      Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,      And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,      Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?        _Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,      And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.        _Sar._ Cursed be he who caused those tears to flow!        _Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50        _Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember      I am a monarch.        _Sal._          Would thou couldst!        _Myr._                               My sovereign,      I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.        _Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked      Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect      That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose      An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.        _Sal._                       It may be,      Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!        _Sar._                                  Brother!      I can at least command myself, who listen      To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60      Beyond my easy nature.        _Sal._                 'Tis beyond      That easy--far too easy--idle nature,      Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!      Though 'twere against myself.        _Sar._                        By the god Baal!      The man would make me tyrant.        _Sal._                        So thou art.      Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that      Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,      The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,      The negligence, the apathy, the evils      Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,                     70      Whose delegated cruelty surpasses      The worst acts of one energetic master,    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2348"],[0,"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax (#3)"],[1,"at  nothing, Watson.  That she is already dead is a very likely  supposition.  If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement  and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends.  It is always  possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed through  it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of  registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the  Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rouges  could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to  keep a person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in  London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling where,  we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our  souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a  word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard.\"    But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very  efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery.  Amid the  crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as  completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were  tried, and failed.  Clues were followed, and led to nothing.  Every  criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain.  His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him.  And then  suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of  light.  A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been  pawned at Bovington's, in Westminster Road.  The pawner was a large,  clean-shaven man of clerical appearance.  His name and address were  demonstrably false.  The ear had escaped notice, but the description  was surely that of Shlessinger.    Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for  news--the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His  clothes were getting looser on his great body.  He seemed to be wilting  away in his anxiety.  \"If you will only give me something to do!\" was  his constant wail.  At last Holmes could oblige him.    \"He has begun to pawn the jewels.  We should get him now.\"    \"But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?\"    Holmes shook his head very gravely.    \"Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that  they cannot let her loose without their own destruction.  We must  prepare for the worst.\"    \"What can I do?\"    \"These people do not know you by sight?\"    \"No.\"    \"It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future.  In that case, we must begin again.  On the other hand, he has had a  fair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money  he will probably come back to Bovington's.  I will give you a note to  them, and they will let you wait in the shop.  If the fellow comes you  will follow him home.  But no indiscretion, and, above all, no  violence.  I put you on your honour that you will take no step without  my knowledge and consent.\"    For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of  the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in  the Crimean War) brought us no news.  On the evening of the third he  rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his  powerful frame quivering with excitement.    \"We have him!  We have him!\" he cried.    He was incoherent in his agitation.  Holmes soothed him with a few  words and thrust him into an armchair.    \"Come, now, give us the order of events,\" said he.    \"She came only an hour ago.  It was the wife, this time, but the  pendant she brought was the fellow of the other.  She is a tall, pale  woman, with ferret eyes.\"    \"That is the lady,\" said Holmes.    \"She left the office and I followed her.  She walked up the Kennington  Road, and I kept behind her.  Presently she went into a shop.  Mr.  Holmes, it was an undertaker's.\"    My companion started.  \"Well?\" he asked in that vibrant voice which  told of the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.    \"She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well.  'It is late,' I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was  excusing herself.  'It should be there before now,' she answered.  'It  took longer, being out of the ordinary.'  They both stopped and looked  at me, so I asked some questions and then left the shop.\"    \"You did excellently well.  What happened next?\"    \"The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway.  Her suspicions  had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a  cab and got in.  I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow  her.  She got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton.  I  drove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the  house.\"    \"Did you see anyone?\"    \"The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The  blind was down, and I could not see in.  I was standing there,  wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two  men in it.  They descended, took something out of the van, and carried  it up the steps to the hall door.  Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"For an instant I was on the point of rushing in.  The door had been  opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had  opened it.  But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I  think that she recognized me.  I saw her start, and she hastily closed  the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.\"    \"You have done excellent work,\" said Holmes, scribbling a few words  upon a half-sheet of paper.  \"We can do nothing legal without a  warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to  the authorities and getting one.  There may be some difficulty, but I  should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient.  Lestrade will see to all details.\"    \"But they may murder her in the meanwhile.  What could the coffin mean,  and for whom could it be but for her?\"    \"We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green.  Not a moment will be  lost.  Leave it in our hands.  Now Watson,\" he added as our client  hurried away, \"he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as  usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action.  The  situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are  justified.  Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.    \"Let us try to reconstruct the situation,\" said he as we drove swiftly  past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge.  \"These  villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first  alienating her from her faithful maid.  If she has written any letters  they have been intercepted.  Through some confederate they have engaged  a furnished house.  Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and  they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been  their object from the first.  Already they have begun to sell part of  it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think  that anyone is interested in the lady's fate.  When she is released she  will, of course, denounce them.  Therefore, she must not be released.  But they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their  only solution.\"    \"That seems very clear.\"    \"Now we will take another line of reasoning.  When you follow two  separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of  intersection which should approximate to the truth.  We will start now,  not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward.  That  incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead.  It  points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical  certificate and official sanction.  Had the lady been obviously  murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden.  But  here all is open and regular.  What does this mean?  Surely that they  have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and  simulated a natural end--poisoning, perhaps.  And yet how strange that  they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a  confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.\"    \"Could they have forged a medical certificate?\"    \"Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous.  No, I hardly see them doing that.  Pull up, cabby!  This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just  passed the pawnbroker's.  Would you go in, Watson?  Your appearance  inspires confidence.  Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes  place to-morrow.\"    The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be  at eight o'clock in the morning.  \"You see, Watson, no mystery;  everything above-board!  In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly  been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear.  Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack.  Are you  armed?\"    \"My stick!\"    \"Well, well, we shall be strong enough.  'Thrice is he armed who hath  his quarrel just.'  We simply can't afford to wait for the police or to  keep within the four corners of the law.  You can drive off, cabby.  Now, Watson, we'll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally  in the past.\"    He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of  Poultney Square.  It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall  woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.    \"Well, what do you want?\" she asked sharply, peering at us through the  darkness.    \"I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,\" said Holmes.    \"There is no such person here,\" she answered, and tried to close the  door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.    \"Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call  himself,\" said Holmes firmly.    She hesitated.  Then she threw open the door.  \"Well, come in!\" said  she.  \"My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.\"  She  closed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room"]]]
