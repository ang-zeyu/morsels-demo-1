In the old countries where  there are these national types, the types may be allowed to hold any  theories. Even if they hold certain theories, they are unlikely to do  certain things. So the conscientious objector, in the English sense,  may be and is one of the peculiar by-products of England. But the  conscientious objector will probably have a conscientious objection to  throwing bombs.    Now I am very far from intending to imply that these American tests are  good tests, or that there is no danger of tyranny becoming the  temptation of America. I shall have something to say later on about that  temptation or tendency. Nor do I say that they apply consistently this  conception of a nation with the soul of a church, protected by religious  and not racial selection. If they did apply that principle consistently,  they would have to exclude pessimists and rich cynics who deny the  democratic ideal; an excellent thing but a rather improbable one. What I  say is that when we realise that this principle exists at all, we see  the whole position in a totally different perspective. We say that the  Americans are doing something heroic, or doing something insane, or  doing it in an unworkable or unworthy fashion, instead of simply  wondering what the devil they are doing.    When we realise the democratic design of such a cosmopolitan  commonwealth, and compare it with our insular reliance or instincts, we  see at once why such a thing has to be not only democratic but dogmatic.  We see why in some points it tends to be inquisitive or intolerant. Any  one can see the practical point by merely transferring into private life  a problem like that of the two academic anarchists, who might by a  coincidence be called the two Herberts. Suppose a man said, 'Buffle, my  old Oxford tutor, wants to meet you; I wish you'd ask him down for a day  or two. He has the oddest opinions, but he's very stimulating.' It would  not occur to us that the oddity of the Oxford don's opinions would lead  him to blow up the house; because the Oxford don is an English type.  Suppose somebody said, 'Do let me bring old Colonel Robinson down for  the week-end; he's a bit of a crank but quite interesting.' We should  not anticipate the colonel running amuck with a carving-knife and  offering up human sacrifice in the garden; for these are not among the  daily habits of an old English colonel; and because we know his habits,  we do not care about his opinions. But suppose somebody offered to bring  a person from the interior of Kamskatka to stay with us for a week or  two, and added that his religion was a very extraordinary religion, we  should feel a little more inquisitive about what kind of religion it  was. If somebody wished to add a Hairy Ainu to the family party at  Christmas, explaining that his point of view was so individual and  interesting, we should want to know a little more about it and him. We  should be tempted to draw up as fantastic an examination paper as that  presented to the emigrant going to America. We should ask what a Hairy  Ainu was, and how hairy he was, and above all what sort of Ainu he was.  Would etiquette require us to ask him to bring his wife? And if we did  ask him to bring his wife, how many wives would he bring? In short, as  in the American formula, is he a polygamist? Merely as a point of  housekeeping and accommodation the question is not irrelevant. Is the  Hairy Ainu content with hair, or does he wear any clothes? If the police  insist on his wearing clothes, will he recognise the authority of the  police? In short, as in the American formula, is he an anarchist?    Of course this generalisation about America, like other historical  things, is subject to all sorts of cross divisions and exceptions, to  be considered in their place. The negroes are a special problem, because  of what white men in the past did to them. The Japanese are a special  problem, because of what men fear that they in the future may do to  white men. The Jews are a special problem, because of what they and the  Gentiles, in the past, present, and future, seem to have the habit of  doing to each other. But the point is not that nothing exists in America  except this idea; it is that nothing like this idea exists anywhere  except in America. This idea is not internationalism; on the contrary it  is decidedly nationalism. The Americans are very patriotic, and wish to  make their new citizens patriotic Americans. But it is the idea of  making a new nation literally out of any old nation that comes along. In  a word, what is unique is not America but what is called  Americanisation. We understand nothing till we understand the amazing  ambition to Americanise the Kamskatkan and the Hairy Ainu. We are not  trying to Anglicise thousands of French cooks or Italian organ-grinders.  France is not trying to Gallicise thousands of English trippers or  German prisoners of war. America is the one place in the world where  this process, healthy or unhealthy, possible or impossible, is going on.  And the process, as I have pointed out, is _not_ internationalisation.  It would be truer to say it is the nationalisation of the  internationalised. It is making a home out of vagabonds and a nation out  of exiles. This is what at once illuminates and softens the moral  regulations which we may really think faddist or fanatical. They are  abnormal; but in one sense this experiment of a home for the homeless is  abnormal. In short, it has long been recognised that America was an  asylum. It is only since Prohibition that it has looked a little like a  lunatic asylum.    It was before sailing for America, as I have said, that I stood with the  official paper in my hand and these thoughts in my head. It was while I  stood on English soil that I passed through the two stages of smiling  and then sympathising; of realising that my momentary amusement, at  being asked if I were not an Anarchist, was partly due to the fact that  I was not an American. And in truth I think there are some things a man  ought to know about America before he sees it. What we know of a country  beforehand may not affect what we see that it is; but it will vitally  affect what we appreciate it for being, because it will vitally affect  what we expect it to be. I can honestly say that I had never expected  America to be what nine-tenths of the newspaper critics invariably  assume it to be. I never thought it was a sort of Anglo-Saxon colony,  knowing that it was more and more thronged with crowds of very different  colonists. During the war I felt that the very worst propaganda for the  Allies was the propaganda for the Anglo-Saxons. I tried to point out  that in one way America is nearer to Europe than England is. If she is  not nearer to Bulgaria, she is nearer to Bulgars; if she is not nearer  to Bohemia, she is nearer to Bohemians. In my New York hotel the head  waiter in the dining-room was a Bohemian; the head waiter in the  grill-room was a Bulgar. Americans have nationalities at the end of the  street which for us are at the ends of the earth. I did my best to  persuade my countrymen not to appeal to the American as if he were a  rather dowdy Englishman, who had been rusticating in the provinces and  had not heard the latest news about the town. I shall record later some  of those arresting realities which the traveller does not expect; and  which, in some cases I fear, he actually does not see because he does  not expect. I shall try to do justice to the psychology of what Mr.  Belloc has called 'Eye-Openers in Travel.' But there are some things  about America that a man ought to see even with his eyes shut. One is  that a state that came into existence solely through its repudiation and  abhorrence of the British Crown is not likely to be a respectful copy of  the British Constitution. Another is that the chief mark of the  Declaration of Independence is something that is not only absent from  the British Constitution, but something which all our constitutionalists  have invariably thanked God, with the jolliest boasting and bragging,  that they had kept out of the British Constitution. It is the thing  called abstraction or academic logic. It is the thing which such jolly  people call theory; and which those who can practise it call thought.  And the theory or thought is the very last to which English people are  accustomed, either by their social structure or their traditional  teaching. It is the theory of equality. It is the pure classic  conception that no man must aspire to be anything more than a citizen,  and that no man should endure to be anything less. It is by no means  especially intelligible to an Englishman, who tends at his best to the  virtues of the gentleman and at his worst to the vices of the snob. The  idealism of England, or if you will the romance of England, has not been  primarily the romance of the citizen. But the idealism of America, we  may safely say, still revolves entirely round the citizen and his  romance. The realities are quite another matter, and we shall consider  in its place the question of whether the ideal will be able to shape  the realities or will merely be beaten shapeless by them. The ideal is  besieged by inequalities of the most towering and insane description in  the industrial and economic field. It may be devoured by modern  capitalism, perhaps the worst inequality that ever existed among men. Of  all that we shall speak later. But citizenship is still the American  ideal; there is an army of actualities opposed to that ideal; but there  is no ideal opposed to that ideal. American plutocracy has never got  itself respected like English aristocracy. Citizenship is the American  ideal; and it has never been the English ideal. But it is surely an  ideal that may stir some imaginative generosity and respect in an  Englishman, if he will condescend to be also a man.

Do you object, Mrs. Warner?\"    \"It was a slip of the tongue,\" Sarah answered, \"and I am grateful to the  member who called attention to it; though I will say that I think there  are some pure men.\"    \"We are discussing Gorky now,\" said Mrs. Blanderocks with an indulgent  smile.    \"True,\" answered Sarah, beaming back at the chairwoman; \"and I was  saying that he had subjected the pure women of the hotel to the  unspeakable indignity of having to sleep under the same roof with the  woman he called his wife.\"    \"I would like to ask,\" I interposed timidly, \"if it is right for a  woman to sleep under the same roof with an impure man, or is it only an  impure woman who is injurious?\"    \"A woman has to sleep under some roof,\" came in the voice of the woman  in the corner.    \"I think Mrs. Grant would show better taste if she did not press such a  question,\" said another voice. \"Will Mrs. Warner be good enough to  describe the exact status--I think status is right--of the woman he  tried to pass as his wife?\"    \"She was his----\" Sarah had a fit of coughing, \"she was not his wife. I  do not care to be more explicit.\"    \"Perhaps,\" I said, groping for light, \"it would be better if I made my  motion read that she should be deported from the country, since it is  her immorality that counts.\"    \"And let those Republican Association women stand for more morality than  we do?\" cried Mrs. Blanderocks. \"No, you cannot make your motion too  strong.\"    \"Oh, then,\" I said, with a sigh of relief, \"I will move that Gorky and  all other men, immoral in the same way, shall be deported from the  country.\"    \"Then who is to take care of us women?\" demanded the voice in the  corner.    \"Do be reasonable, Margaret,\" said Sarah Warner, \"we can't drive all the  men out of the country, and don't want to, but we can fix a standard of  morals to astonish the world, and there could be no better way than by  making an example of this man Gorky. Don't you see that he is a  foreigner and can't very well know that our men are just as bad as he  is? Besides, isn't he a Socialist? We would have been willing to condone  his relations with that woman if only he'd hid them respectably as our  men do, but to come here with his free ideas---- Well, I'm willing to  let the Russians have all the freedom they want, and I would have given  my mite toward stirring up trouble over there, but we have all the  freedom we want over here, and a little more, too, if I know anything  about it.\"    \"Very well,\" I replied, \"I will withdraw the motion and make one to have  a committee appointed to investigate the matter and find out the whole  truth about it.\"    \"What is there to find out?\" demanded Sarah, aghast.    \"Well, you know he insists that she is his wife. Maybe she is by  Russian law or custom.\"    \"Perfectly absurd! His own wife and he separated because they couldn't  be happy together. Was ever anything more ridiculous?\"    \"As if happiness had anything to do with marriage!\" said the voice from  the corner.    Everybody laughed and applauded as if something very funny had been  said.    \"Well, anyhow,\" I insisted, for I can be obstinate when a thing isn't  clear to me, \"if they both thought they were justified in calling  themselves man and wife, and if the people in Russia thought so, too,  why should we make any fuss about it?\"    \"Pardon me, Mrs. Grant,\" said Mrs. Blanderocks, suavely, \"if I say that  your words are very silly. In the first place, the Russians are  barbarians, as we all know; and, in the next place, the law is the law,  and the law says that a man may not have two wives. A man who does is a  bigamist. A man who has a wife and yet lives with another woman is an  adulterer. Pardon me for using such a word, but it was forced from me.  Now, this man Gorky, who may be a very great genius for all I know--I  never read any of his stuff--but he isn't above the law: not above the  moral law anyhow, and the moral law is the same all over the world. He  says he and his wife parted because they were unhappy together, which is  a very flimsy excuse for immorality. Then he says that his wife is  living now with a man she loves and is happy with.\"    \"Which makes a bad matter worse,\" interposed Sarah Warner. \"No one has  any business to be happy in immorality.\"    \"What is morality for,\" demanded the voice from the corner, \"if it isn't  to make people unhappy?\"    Everybody screamed with laughter over that, and Mrs. Blanderocks went so  far as to raise her eyebrows at Sarah Warner, who bit her lip to keep  from smiling.    \"But,\" said I, for I had been reading the papers, too, \"he says the  reason they were not divorced was because the Church would not permit  it.\"    \"If the laws of his country were opposed to this divorce,\" said Mrs.  Blanderocks, triumphantly, \"all the more reason why he should be  ashamed of living with this actress in such an open, defiant way.\"    \"The Church has nothing to do with divorces in this country,\" I said,  \"yet many of our best people are divorced.\"    \"The law permits it,\" said Mrs. Blanderocks curtly.    \"Who makes the law?\" I asked, determined to get at the bottom of the  thing if I could.    \"The people through the Legislature,\" was the prompt answer.    \"Well,\" I said, very timidly, not knowing but I was quite in the wrong,  \"it seems that the people of Russia not being able to make laws  nevertheless recognize the separation of a man and his wife as proper,  and permit them to take other husbands and wives without loss of  standing.\"    \"A law's a law,\" said Sarah, sternly; \"and a law should be sacred. The  very idea of anybody pretending to be above the law like this man Gorky!  I would like to know what would become of the holy institution of  matrimony if it could be trifled with in such a fashion?\"    \"You want Russia to be free from the rule of the Tsar, don't you?\" I  asked.    \"Certainly, he is a tyrant and an irresponsible weakling, unfit to  govern a great people. Of course, we want Russia to be free. The people  of Russia are entitled to be free, to govern themselves.\"    \"Do you think they ought to be allowed to make their own laws?\" I asked.    \"Of course.\"    \"Then, why do you say that Gorky is not properly divorced from his first  wife and married to his second? The people of Russia approve.\"    \"Margaret Grant!\" cried Sarah, outraged and voicing the horror of the  other members, \"I sometimes wonder if you have any respect at all for  the law. How can you speak as you do? If men and women could dispense  with the law in that way what would become of society?\"    \"But this state used to permit men and women to live together without  any ceremony and so become man and wife,\" I said.    \"Well, we don't permit it now,\" retorted Sarah, grimly.    \"If they want to live together now,\" cried the voice from the corner,  \"they must pretend they don't, even if everybody knows they do.\"    Some of the members laughed at that, but Mrs. Blanderocks thought that  was going too far and said so in her coldest manner.    \"I see nothing funny in that. We cannot change the natures of men, but  we can insist upon their hiding their baser conduct and the degraded  portions of their lives from our view.\"    \"But,\" said I, \"Gorky evidently considers this woman his wife, and had  no idea that anybody would think otherwise.\"    \"The point is,\" said Sarah Warner, in exasperation, \"and I think I voice  the sentiments of this organization, that he was not legally divorced  from his first wife and that, therefore, he cannot be legally married to  this woman. A law is a law, no matter who makes it. The law is sacred  and must not be tampered with.\"    \"How about the Supreme Court on divorces in Dakota?\" demanded the voice  from the corner.    A dead silence fell on the meeting. Some of the members looked at each  other and showed signs of hysterics. Mrs. Blanderocks flashed a  withering glance at the corner, but rose to the occasion.    \"Ladies,\" she said in a solemn tone, \"I deeply regret that this subject  has been touched upon in a spirit of levity. It was my intention, at the  proper time, to introduce a resolution of sympathy for those ladies who  have been so summarily and I may say brutally unmarried by the unfeeling  wretches who sit upon the bench of the Supreme Court. It is awful to  think that our highly respected sisters, whose wealth alone should have  protected them, have been told by the highest court in the land that  they have been living in shame all this time, and that their children  are not legitimate. Ladies, I call your attention to the fact that many  of our own members are thus branded by those judges. It is infamous. It  is more than infamous--it is a reason why women should sit on the  judicial bench.\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"it seems impossible for men to comprehend the mental or  emotional processes of women.\"    \"True, too true,\" murmured our President, giving me a look of gratitude.  \"I remember how the men of this country cried out against us a few  years ago because they could not understand why we send flowers and  tender letters to a poor, handsome negro who had first outraged and then  murdered a woman.\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"and no doubt they will pretend not to understand our  indignation against this man Gorky, who thinks the customs of his own  country justify him his terrible conduct. But we must be careful how we  word our condemnation of this man lest he should somehow learn of what  our Supreme Court has so"]]]
