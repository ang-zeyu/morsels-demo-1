VI           Danny Meadow Mouse Remembers, Reddy Fox Forgets      \"There he goes!\" cried old Granny Fox. \"Don't let him sit still  again!\"    \"I hear him!\" shouted Reddy Fox, and plunged down into the snow  just as Granny Fox had done a minute before. But he didn't catch  anything, and when he had blown the snow out of his nose and  wiped it out of his eyes, he saw Granny Fox dive into the snow  with no better luck.    \"Never mind,\" said Granny Fox, \"as long as we keep him running,  we can hear him, and some one of these times we'll catch him.  Pretty soon he'll get too tired to be so spry, and when he is--\"  Granny didn't finish, but licked her chops and smacked her lips.  Reddy Fox grinned, then licked his chops and smacked his lips.  Then once more they took turns diving into the snow.    [Illustration: _Granny didn't finish, but licked her chops and  smacked her lips_]    And down underneath in the little tunnels he had made, Danny  Meadow Mouse was running for his life. He was getting tired,  just as old Granny Fox had said he would. He was almost out of  breath. He was sore and one leg smarted, for in one of her jumps  old Granny Fox had so nearly caught him that her claws had torn  his pants and scratched him.    \"Oh dear! Oh dear! If only I had time to think!\" panted Danny  Meadow Mouse, and then he squealed in still greater fright as  Reddy Fox crashed down into his tunnel right at his very heels.  \"I've got to get somewhere! I've got to get somewhere where they  can't get at me!\" he sobbed. And right that very instant he  remembered the old fence post!    The old fence post lay on the ground and was hollow. Fastened to  it were long wires with sharp, cruel barbs. Danny had made a  tunnel over to that old fence post the very first day after the  snow came, for in that hollow in the old post he had a secret  store of seeds. Why hadn't he thought of it before? It must have  been because he was too frightened to think. But he remembered  now, and he dodged into the tunnel that led to the old fence  post, running faster than ever, for though his heart was in his  mouth from fear, in his heart was hope, and hope is a wonderful  thing.    Now old Granny Fox knew all about that old fence post and she  remembered all about those barbed wires fastened to it. Although  they were covered with snow she knew just about where they lay,  and just before she reached them she stopped plunging down into  the snow. Reddy Fox knew about those wires, too, but he was so  excited that he forgot all about them.    \"Stop!\" cried old Granny Fox sharply.    But Reddy Fox didn't hear, or if he heard he didn't heed. His  sharp ears could hear Danny Meadow Mouse running almost  underneath him. Granny Fox could stop if she wanted to, but he  was going to have Danny Meadow Mouse for his breakfast! Down into  the snow he plunged as hard as ever he could.    \"Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Oh dear! Oh dear!\"    That wasn't the voice of Danny Meadow Mouse. Oh, my, no! It was  the voice of Reddy Fox. Yes, Sir, it was the voice of Reddy Fox.  He had landed with one of his black paws right on one of those  sharp wire barbs, and it did hurt dreadfully.    \"I never did know a young Fox who could get into as much trouble  as you can!\" snapped old Granny Fox, as Reddy hobbled along on  three legs behind her, across the snow-covered Green Meadows. \"It  serves you right for forgetting!\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Reddy meekly.    And safe in the hollow of the old fence post, Danny Meadow Mouse  was dressing the scratch on his leg made by the claws of old  Granny Fox.                                       VII                   Old Granny Fox Tries a New Plan      Old Granny Fox kept thinking about Danny Meadow Mouse. She knew  that he was fat, and it made her mouth water every time she  thought of him. She made up her mind that she must and would have  him. She knew that Danny had been very, very much frightened when  she and Reddy Fox had tried so hard to catch him by plunging  down through the snow into his little tunnels after him, and she  felt pretty sure that he wouldn't go far away from the old fence  post, in the hollow of which he was snug and safe.    Old Granny Fox is very smart. \"Danny Meadow Mouse won't put his  nose out of that old fence post for a day or two. Then he'll get  tired of staying inside all the time, and he'll peep out of one  of his little round doorways to see if the way is clear. If he  doesn't see any danger, he'll come out and run around on top of  the snow to get some of the seeds in the tops of the tall grasses  that stick out through the snow. If nothing frightens him, he'll  keep going a little farther and a little farther from that old  fence post. I must see to it that Danny Meadow Mouse isn't  frightened for a few days.\" So said old Granny Fox to herself, as  she lay under a hemlock tree, studying how she could best get the  next meal.    Then she called Reddy Fox to her and forbade him to go down on  the meadows until she should tell him he might. Reddy grumbled  and mumbled and didn't see why he shouldn't go where he pleased,  but he didn't dare disobey. You see, he had a sore foot. He had  hurt it on a wire barb when he was plunging through the snow  after Danny Meadow Mouse, and now he had to run on three legs.  That meant that he must depend upon Granny Fox to help him get  enough to eat. So Reddy didn't dare to disobey.    It all came out just as Granny Fox had thought it would. Danny  Meadow Mouse did get tired of staying in the old fence post. He  did peep out first, and then he did run a little way on the  snow, and then a little farther and a little farther. But all the  time he took great care not to get more than a jump or two from  one of his little round doorways leading down to his tunnels  under the snow.    Hidden on the edge of the Green Forest, Granny Fox watched him.  She looked up at the sky, and she knew that it was going to snow  again. \"That's good,\" said she. \"Tomorrow morning I'll have fat  Meadow Mouse for breakfast,\" and she smiled a hungry smile.    The next morning, before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was out of  bed, old Granny Fox trotted down onto the meadows and straight  over to where, down under the snow, lay the old fence post. It  had snowed again, and all the little doorways of Danny Meadow  Mouse were covered up with soft, fleecy snow. Behind Granny Fox  limped Reddy Fox, grumbling to himself.    When they reached the place where the old fence post lay buried  under the snow, old Granny Fox stretched out as flat as she  could. Then she told Reddy to cover her up with the new soft  snow. Reddy did as he was told, but all the time he grumbled.  \"Now you go off to the Green Forest and keep out of sight,\" said  Granny Fox. \"By and by I'll bring you some Meadow Mouse for your  breakfast,\" and Granny Fox chuckled to think how smart she was  and how she was going to catch Danny Meadow Mouse.    [Illustration]                                      VIII                 Brother North Wind Proves a Friend      Danny Meadow Mouse had seen nothing of old Granny Fox or Reddy  Fox for several days. Every morning the first thing he did, even  before he had breakfast, was to climb up to one of his little  round doorways and peep out over the beautiful white meadows, to  see if there was any danger near. But every time he did this,  Danny used a different doorway. \"For,\" said Danny to himself, \"if  anyone should happen, just happen, to see me this morning, they  might be waiting just outside my doorway to catch me tomorrow  morning.\" You see, there is a great deal of wisdom in the little  head that Danny Meadow Mouse carries on his shoulders.    But the first day and the second day and the third day he saw  nothing of old Granny Fox or of Reddy Fox, and he began to enjoy  running through his tunnels under the snow and scurrying across  from one doorway to another on top of the snow, just as he had  before the Foxes had tried so hard to catch him. But he hadn't  forgotten, as Granny Fox had hoped he would. No, indeed, Danny  Meadow Mouse hadn't forgotten. He was too wise for that.    One morning, when he started to climb up to one of his little  doorways, he found that it was closed. Yes, Sir, it was closed.  In fact, there wasn't any doorway. More snow had fallen from the  clouds in the night and had covered up every one of the little  round doorways of Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Ha!\" said Danny, \"I shall have a busy day, a very busy day,  opening all my doorways. I'll eat my breakfast, and then I'll go  to work.\"    So Danny Meadow Mouse ate a good breakfast of seeds which he had  stored in the hollow in the old fence post buried under the snow,  and then he began work on the nearest doorway. It really wasn't  work at all, for you see, the snow was soft and light, and Danny  dearly loved to dig in it. In a few minutes he had made a wee  hole through which he could peep up at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun.  In a few minutes more he had made it big enough to put his head  out. He looked this way and he looked that way. Far, far off on  the top of a tree he could see old Roughleg the Hawk, but he was  so far away that Danny didn't fear him at all.    \"I don't see anything or anybody to be afraid of,\" said Danny and  poked his head out a little farther.    [Illustration: _It was a beautiful white world, a very beautiful  white world_]    Then he sat and studied everything around him a long, long time.  It was a beautiful white world, a very beautiful white world.  Everything was so white and pure and beautiful that it didn't  seem possible that harm or danger for anyone could even be  thought of. But Danny Meadow Mouse learned long ago that things  are not always what they seem, and so he sat with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25546"],[0,"Songs of a Sourdough (#3)"],[1,"for its clothes.      And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your            bones,      And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like            stones.      And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,      And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.      And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail, and the snows where your            torn feet freeze,      And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and            knees.      Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;      By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're            fain.      By your bones they will follow behind you, till the ways of the            world are made plain.        _Bid good-bye to sweetheart, bid good-bye to friend;      The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.      Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;      Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._          THE HEART OF THE SOURDOUGH          There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon;      There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,      And the glacier-gutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June:        There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;      There where the Silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows      Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber, and rose:        There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;      Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun--      I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.               *       *       *       *       *        I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;      It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure, it's the lure of the            timeless things;      And to-night, O God of the trails untrod, how it whines in my            heart-strings!        I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make-believe and            your show;      I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shake-down in the snow,      A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe;        With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life, the wild that would            crush and rend;      I have clinched and closed with the naked North, I have learned to            defy and defend;      Shoulder to shoulder we've fought it out--yet the Wild must win in            the end.        I have flouted the Wild. I have followed its lure, fearless,            familiar, alone;      By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;      Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.        Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;      Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;      Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.          THE THREE VOICES          The waves have a story to tell me,        As I lie on the lonely beach;      Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,        The wind has a lesson to teach;      But the stars sing an anthem of glory        I cannot put into speech.        The waves tell of ocean spaces,        Of hearts that are wild and brave,      Of populous city places,        Of desolate shores they lave;      Of men who sally in quest of gold        To sink in an ocean grave.        The wind is a mighty roamer;        He bids me keep me free,      Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,        Hardy and pure as he;      Cling with my love to nature        As a child to the mother-knee.        But the stars throng out in their glory,        And they sing of the God in man;      They sing of the mighty Master,        Of the loom His fingers span;      Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,        And weft in the wondrous plan.        Here by the camp-fire's flicker,        Deep in my blanket curled,      I long for the peace of the pine-gloom        When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,      And the wind and the wave are silent,        And world is singing to world.          THE PINES          We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;      The grey moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,      And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam            shines.        On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions            massed;      We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;      From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.        To the niggard lands were we driven; 'twixt desert and foe are we            penned.      To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;      Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end.        Ours from the bleak beginning, through the aeons of death-like sleep;      Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing            deep;      Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier-creep.        Wind of the East, wind of the West, wandering to and fro,      Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know      The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last            to go!        We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;      The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole, and our ancients crash            and roar;      But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.        We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap            we lie;      From the white foam-fringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks            that tusk the sky      We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a            golden eye,--        Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:      Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;      A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.        Sun, moon and stars, give answer; shall we not staunchly stand      Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,      Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last lone land!          THE HARPY          _There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she;      She was old, so old, yet her years all told were but a score and three;      And she knew by heart, from finish to start, the Book of Iniquity._        There is no hope for such as I, on earth nor yet in Heaven;      Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven;      A loathed jade I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven.        I paint my cheeks, for they are white, and cheeks of chalk men hate;      Mine eyes with wine I make to shine, that men may seek and sate;      With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait.        Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame;      Your sweethearts, sons, ye scornful ones--'tis I who know their shame;      The gods ye see are brutes to me--and so I play my game.        For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan;      And woman in a bitter world must do the best she can;      Must yield the stroke, and bear the yoke, and serve the will of man;        Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire;      Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire;      For every man since life began is tainted with the mire.        And though you know he love you so, and set you on love's throne,      Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs, and let your heart be stone,      Lest you be left (as I was left) attainted and alone.        From love's close kiss to hell's abyss is one sheer flight, I trow;      And wedding-ring and bridal bell are will-o'-wisps of woe;      And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know.        Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey,      With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf-pack pay;      With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay.        One who in youth sought truest truth, and found a devil's lies;      A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice:      Yet shall I blame on man the shame? Could it be otherwise?        Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride?      The Maker marred, and evil-starred I drift upon His tide;      And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide.        _Fate has written a tragedy; its name is \"The Human Heart.\"      The theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part:      The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start._          THE LURE OF LITTLE VOICES          There's a cry from out the Loneliness--Oh, listen, Honey, listen!        Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?      You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they            glisten--        Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?        All a-begging me to leave you. Day and night they're pleading, praying,        On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the            plain;      Night and day they never leave me--do you know what they are saying?        \"He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again.\"        Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;        They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;      They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and god-like spaces,        The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.        They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming        In the womb of desolation where was never man before;      As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming;        And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.        And now they're all a-cry"]]]
