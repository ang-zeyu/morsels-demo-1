[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#3)"],[1," incompetent catering of the English country hotel-keeper to  the demands of the traveller who would dine off of something more  attractive than a cut from a cold joint of ham, and eggs washed down  with stodgy, bitter beer.    The bibliography of travel books is long, and includes many famous  names in literature. Marco Polo, Froissart, Mme. de Sevigne, Taine,  Bayard Taylor, Willis, Stevenson, and Sterne, all had opportunities  for observation and made the most of them. If they had lived in the  days of the automobile they might have sung a song of speed which  would have been the most melodious chord in the whole gamut.    A modern writer must be more modest, however. He can hardly hope to  attract attention to himself or his work by describing the usual  sights and scenes. The most he can do is to set down his method of  travel, his approach, and his departure, and, for example, to tell  those who may come after that the great double spires of Notre Dame  de Chartres are a beacon by land for nearly twenty kilometers in any  direction, as he approaches them by road across the great plain of La  Beauce, the granary of France, rather than give a repetition of the  well-worn guidebook facts concerning them.    [Illustration: Ideal Car]    Chartres is taken as an example because it is one of those \"stock\"  sights, before mentioned, which any itinerary coming within the scope  of the _grand tour_ is bound to include.    Almost the same phenomenon is true of Antwerp's lacelike spire, the  great Gothic wonder of Cologne and, to a lesser extent, that of  Canterbury in England; thus the automobilist _en route_ has his  beacons and landmarks as has the sailor on the seas.    Man is an animal essentially mobile. He moves readily from place to  place and is not tied down by anything but ways and means and,  perhaps, confinement at laborious affairs. Even in the latter case he  occasionally breaks away for a more or less extended period, and  either goes fishing in Canada, shooting in Scotland, or automobiling  in France, with perhaps a rush over a Swiss pass or two, and a dash  around the Italian lakes, and back down the Rhine for a little tour  in Great Britain.    This is as delightful a holiday as one could imagine, and the foreign  tour--which has often been made merely as a succession of nights of  travel in stuffy sleeping-cars or a round of overfeeding orgies at  Parisian hotels and restaurants--has added charms of which the  generation before the advent of automobiles knew nought.    The question of comfortable travel is a never-ending one. The  palanquin, the sedan-chair, the rickshaw, even the humble horse-drawn  buggy have had their devotees, but the modern touring automobile has  left them all far behind, whether for long-distance travel or  promenades at Fontainebleau, in the New Forest or the Ardennes.    There is no question but that, when touring in an automobile, one has  an affection for his steel-and-iron horse that he never felt for any  other conveyance. The horse had some endearing qualities, no doubt,  and we were bound to regard his every want; but he was only a part of  the show, whereas the automobile, although it is nought but an  inanimate combination of wheels and things, has to be humoured and  talked to, and even cursed at times, in order to keep it going. But  it works faithfully nevertheless, and never balks, at least not with  the same crankiness as the horse, and always runs better toward night  (this is curious, but it is a fact), which a horse seldom does. All  the same an automobile is like David Balfour's Scotch advocate: hard  at times to ken rightly--most of the time, one may say without undue  exaggeration. Often an automobile is as fickle as a stage fairy, or  appears to be, but it may be that only your own blind stupidity  accounts for the lack of efficiency. Once in awhile an automobile  gets uproariously full of spirits and runs away with itself, and  almost runs away with you, too, simply for the reason that the  carburetion is good and everything is pulling well. Again it is as  silent and immovable as a sphinx and gives no hint of its present or  expected ailments. It is most curious, but an automobile invents some  new real or fancied complaint with each fresh internal upheaval, and  requires, in each and every instance, an entirely new and original  diagnosis.    With all its caprices, however, the automobile is the most efficient  and satisfactory contrivance for getting about from place to place,  for business or pleasure, that was ever devised.    Comparatively speaking, the railway is not to be thought of for a  moment. It has all the disadvantages of the automobile (for indeed  there are a few, such as dust and more or less cramped quarters, and,  if one chooses, a nerve-racking speed) and none of its advantages,  and, whether you are a mere man or a millionaire, you are tied down  to rails and a strict itinerary, whereas you may turn the bonnet of  your automobile down any by-road that pleases your fancy, and arrive  ultimately at your destination, having made an enjoyable detour which  would not otherwise have been possible.    Too great a speed undoubtedly detracts from the joy of travel, but a  hundred and fifty, two hundred and fifty, or three hundred kilometres  a day on the fine roads of France, or a hundred or a hundred and  fifty miles on the leafy lanes of England's southern counties will  give the stranger more varied impressions and a clearer understanding  of men and matters than the touring of a country from end to end in  express-trains which serve your meals _en route_, and whisk you from  London to Torquay between tea and dinner, or from Paris to the Cote  d'Azur between breakfast and nightfall.    Just how much pleasure and edification one can absorb during an  automobile tour depends largely upon the individual--and the mood.  Once the craving for speed is felt, not all the historic monuments in  the world would induce one to stop a sweetly running motor; but again  the other mood comes on, and one lingers a full day among the charms  of the lower Seine from Caudebec to Rouen, scarce thirty miles.    Les Andelys-sur-Seine, your guide-book tells you, is noted for its  magnificent ruins of Richard Coeur de Lion's Chateau Gaillard, and  for the culture of the sugar-beet, and so, often, merely on account  of the banal mention of beet-roots, you ignore the attractions of  Richard's castle and make the best time you can Parisward by the  great Route Nationale on the other side of the Seine. This is wrong,  of course, but the mood was on, and the song of speed was ringing in  your ears and nothing would drive it out.    Our fathers and grandfathers made the grand tour, in a twelvemonth,  as a sort of topping-off to their early education, before they  settled down to a business or professional life.    They checked off in their guide-books Melrose Abbey, the Tower of  London, the Cathedral of Canterbury, and those of Antwerp, Cologne,  Rome, Venice, and Paris, as they did the Cheshire Cheese, Mont Blanc,  and the ruins of Carnac. It was all a part of the general scheme of  travel, to cover a lot of ground and see all they could, for it was  likely that they would pass that way but once. Why, then, should one  blame the automobilist--who really travels very leisurely in that he  sees a lot of the countryside manners and customs off the beaten  track--if he rushes over an intermediate stretch of country in order  to arrive at one more to his liking?    One sees the thing every day on any of the great highroads in France  leading from the Channel ports. One's destination may be the  Pyrenees, the Cote d'Azur, Italy, or even Austria, and he does the  intermediate steps at full speed. The same is true if he goes to  Switzerland by the Rhine valley, or to Homburg by passing through  Belgium or Holland. He might be just as well pleased with a fortnight  in the Ardennes, or even in Holland or in Touraine, but, if his  destination is Monte Carlo or Biarritz, he is not likely to linger  longer by the way than the exigencies of food, drink, and lodging,  and the care of his automobile demand.    When he has no objective point he loiters by the way and no doubt  enjoys it the more, but it is not fair to put the automobilist down  as a scorcher simply because he is pushing on. The best guide-books  are caprice and fantasy, if you are hot pressed for time.    Mile-stones, or rather _bornes kilometriques_, line the roadways of  Continental military Europe mercilessly, and it's a bad sign when the  chauffeur begins to count them off. All the same, he knows his  destination a great deal better than does some plodding tourist by  rail who scorns him for rushing off again immediately after lunch.    One of the charms of travel, to the tried traveller, is, just as  in the time of the Abbe Prevost, the ability to exchange remarks  on one's itinerary with one's fellow travellers. In France it  does not matter much whether they are automobilists or not. The  _commis-voyageur_ is a more numerous class here, apparently, than in  any other country on the globe, and the detailed information which he  can give one about the towns and hotels and sights and scenes _en  route_, albeit he is more familiar with travel by rail than by road,  is marvellous in quantity and valuable as to quality.    The automobile tourist, who may be an Englishman or an American, has  hitherto been catered to with automobile novels, or love stories, or  whatever one chooses to call them, or with more or less scrappy,  incomplete, and badly edited accounts of tours made by some  millionaire possessor of a motor-car, or the means to hire one. Some  of the articles in the press, and an occasional book, have the merit  of having been \"good stuff,\" but often they have gone wrong in the  making.    The writer of this book does not aspire to be classed with either of  the above classes of able writers; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#3)"],[1,"am'rous call,--      Ah, now I know his heart doth sing!        O bluebird, welcome back again,        Thy azure coat and ruddy vest        Are hues that April loveth best,--      Warm skies above the furrowed plain.        The farm boy hears thy tender voice,        And visions come of crystal days,        With sugar-camps in maple ways,      And scenes that make his heart rejoice.        The lucid smoke drifts on the breeze,        The steaming pans are mantling white,        And thy blue wing's a joyous sight,      Among the brown and leafless trees.        Now loosened currents glance and run,        And buckets shine on sturdy boles,        The forest folk peep from their holes,      And work is play from sun to sun.        The downy beats his sounding limb,        The nuthatch pipes his nasal call,        And Robin perched on tree-top tall      Heavenward lifts his evening hymn.        Now go and bring thy homesick bride,        Persuade her here is just the place        To build a home and found a race      In Downy's cell, my lodge beside.          THE ROBIN      Not long after the bluebird comes the robin. In large numbers they scour  the fields and groves. You hear their piping in the meadow, in the  pasture, on the hillside. Walk in the woods, and the dry leaves rustle  with the whir of their wings, the air is vocal with their cheery call.  In excess of joy and vivacity, they run, leap, scream, chase each other  through the air, diving and sweeping among the trees with perilous  rapidity.    In that free, fascinating, half-work-and-half-play  pursuit,--sugar-making,--a pursuit which still lingers in many parts of  New York, as in New England,--the robin is one's constant companion.  When the day is sunny and the ground bare, you meet him at all points  and hear him at all hours. At sunset, on the tops of the tall maples,  with look heavenward, and in a spirit of utter abandonment, he carols  his simple strain. And sitting thus amid the stark, silent trees, above  the wet, cold earth, with the chill of winter still in the air, there is  no fitter or sweeter songster in the whole round year. It is in keeping  with the scene and the occasion. How round and genuine the notes are,  and how eagerly our ears drink them in! The first utterance, and the  spell of winter is thoroughly broken, and the remembrance of it afar  off.    One of the most graceful of warriors is the robin. I know few prettier  sights than two males challenging and curveting about each other upon  the grass in early spring. Their attentions to each other are so  courteous and restrained. In alternate curves and graceful sallies, they  pursue and circumvent each other. First one hops a few feet, then the  other, each one standing erect in true military style while his fellow  passes him and describes the segment of an ellipse about him, both  uttering the while a fine complacent warble in a high but suppressed  key. Are they lovers or enemies? the beholder wonders, until they make a  spring and are beak to beak in the twinkling of an eye, and perhaps  mount a few feet into the air, but rarely actually deliver blows upon  each other. Every thrust is parried, every movement met. They follow  each other with dignified composure about the fields or lawn, into trees  and upon the ground, with plumage slightly spread, breasts glowing,  their lisping, shrill war-song just audible. It forms on the whole the  most civil and high-bred tilt to be witnessed during the season.    In the latter half of April, we pass through what I call the \"robin  racket,\"--trains of three or four birds rushing pell-mell over the lawn  and fetching up in a tree or bush, or occasionally upon the ground, all  piping and screaming at the top of their voices, but whether in mirth or  anger it is hard to tell. The nucleus of the train is a female. One  cannot see that the males in pursuit of her are rivals; it seems rather  as if they had united to hustle her out of the place. But somehow the  matches are no doubt made and sealed during these mad rushes. Maybe the  female shouts out to her suitors, \"Who touches me first wins,\" and away  she scurries like an arrow. The males shout out, \"Agreed!\" and away they  go in pursuit, each trying to outdo the other. The game is a brief one.  Before one can get the clew to it, the party has dispersed.           *       *       *       *       *    The first year of my cabin life a pair of robins attempted to build a  nest upon the round timber that forms the plate under my porch roof. But  it was a poor place to build in. It took nearly a week's time and caused  the birds a great waste of labor to find this out. The coarse material  they brought for the foundation would not bed well upon the rounded  surface of the timber, and every vagrant breeze that came along swept it  off. My porch was kept littered with twigs and weed-stalks for days,  till finally the birds abandoned the undertaking. The next season a  wiser or more experienced pair made the attempt again, and succeeded.  They placed the nest against the rafter where it joins the plate; they  used mud from the start to level up with and to hold the first twigs and  straws, and had soon completed a firm, shapely structure. When the young  were about ready to fly, it was interesting to note that there was  apparently an older and a younger, as in most families. One bird was  more advanced than any of the others. Had the parent birds intentionally  stimulated it with extra quantities of food, so as to be able to launch  their offspring into the world one at a time? At any rate, one of the  birds was ready to leave the nest a day and a half before any of the  others. I happened to be looking at it when the first impulse to get  outside the nest seemed to seize it. Its parents were encouraging it  with calls and assurances from some rocks a few yards away. It answered  their calls in vigorous, strident tones. Then it climbed over the edge  of the nest upon the plate, took a few steps forward, then a few more,  till it was a yard from the nest and near the end of the timber, and  could look off into free space. Its parents apparently shouted, \"Come  on!\" But its courage was not quite equal to the leap; it looked around,  and, seeing how far it was from home, scampered back to the nest, and  climbed into it like a frightened child. It had made its first journey  into the world, but the home tie had brought it quickly back. A few  hours afterward it journeyed to the end of the plate again, and then  turned and rushed back. The third time its heart was braver, its wings  stronger, and, leaping into the air with a shout, it flew easily to some  rocks a dozen or more yards away. Each of the young in succession, at  intervals of nearly a day, left the nest in this manner. There would be  the first journey of a few feet along the plate, the first sudden panic  at being so far from home, the rush back, a second and perhaps a third  attempt, and then the irrevocable leap into the air, and a clamorous  flight to a near-by bush or rock. Young birds never go back when they  have once taken flight. The first free flap of the wings severs forever  the ties that bind them to home.           *       *       *       *       *    I recently observed a robin boring for grubs in a country dooryard. It  is a common enough sight to witness one seize an angle-worm and drag it  from its burrow in the turf, but I am not sure that I ever before saw  one drill for grubs and bring the big white morsel to the surface. The  robin I am speaking of had a nest of young in a maple near by, and she  worked the neighborhood very industriously for food. She would run  along over the short grass after the manner of robins, stopping every  few feet, her form stiff and erect. Now and then she would suddenly bend  her head toward the ground and bring eye or ear for a moment to bear  intently upon it. Then she would spring to boring the turf vigorously  with her bill, changing her attitude at each stroke, alert and watchful,  throwing up the grass roots and little jets of soil, stabbing deeper and  deeper, growing every moment more and more excited, till finally a fat  grub was seized and brought forth. Time after time, during several days,  I saw her mine for grubs in this way and drag them forth. How did she  know where to drill? The insect was in every case an inch below the  surface. Did she hear it gnawing the roots of the grasses, or did she  see a movement in the turf beneath which the grub was at work? I know  not. I only know that she struck her game unerringly each time. Only  twice did I see her make a few thrusts and then desist, as if she had  been for the moment deceived.          THE FLICKER      Another April comer, who arrives shortly after Robin Redbreast, with  whom he associates both at this season and in the autumn, is the  golden-winged woodpecker, _alias_ \"high-hole,\" _alias_ \"flicker,\"  _alias_ \"yarup,\" _alias_ \"yellow-hammer.\" He is an old favorite of my  boyhood, and his note to me means very much. He announces his arrival by  a long, loud call, repeated from the dry branch of some tree, or a stake  in the fence,--a thoroughly melodious April sound. I think how Solomon  finished that beautiful description of spring, \"and the voice of the  turtle is heard in our land,\" and see that a description of spring in  this farming country, to be equally characteristic, should culminate in  like manner,--\"and the call of the high-hole comes up from the wood.\" It  is a loud, strong, sonorous call, and does not seem to imply an answer,  but rather to subserve some purpose of love or music. It is \"Yarup's\"  proclamation of peace and good-will to all.    I recall an ancient maple standing sentry to a large sugar-bush, that,  year after year, afforded protection to a brood of yellow-hammers in its  decayed heart. A week or two before the nesting seemed actually to have  begun, three or four of these birds"]]]
