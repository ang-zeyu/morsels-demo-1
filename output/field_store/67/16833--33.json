The Pelasgians who joined this young hero helped him to build great  walls all around his town. These were provided with massive gateways and  tall towers, from which the soldiers could overlook the whole country,  and see the approach of an enemy from afar.    [Illustration: The Lion Gate, Mycenae.]    This same people built tombs for some of the ancient kings, and many  treasure and store houses. These buildings, buried under earth and  rubbish, were uncovered a few years ago. In the tombs were found swords,  spears, and remains of ancient armor, gold ornaments, ancient pieces of  pottery, human bones, and, strangest of all, thin masks of pure gold,  which covered the faces of some of the dead.    Thus you see, the Pelasgians little by little joined the new colonies  which came to take possession of the land, and founded little states or  countries of their own, each governed by its own king, and obeying its  own laws.          IV. STORY OF DEUCALION.      The Greeks used to tell their children that Deu-ca'li-on, the leader of  the Thes-sa'li-ans, was a descendant of the gods, for each part of the  country claimed that its first great man was the son of a god. It was  under the reign of Deucalion that another flood took place. This was  even more terrible than that of Ogyges; and all the people of the  neighborhood fled in haste to the high mountains north of Thes'sa-ly,  where they were kindly received by Deucalion.    When all danger was over, and the waters began to recede, they followed  their leader down into the plains again. This soon gave rise to a  wonderful story, which you will often hear. It was said that Deucalion  and his wife Pyr'rha were the only people left alive after the flood.  When the waters had all gone, they went down the mountain, and found  that the temple at Del'phi, where they worshiped their gods, was still  standing unharmed. They entered, and, kneeling before the altar, prayed  for help.    A mysterious voice then bade them go down the mountain, throwing their  mother's bones behind them. They were very much troubled when they heard  this, until Deucalion said that a voice from heaven could not have  meant them to do any harm. In thinking over the real meaning of the  words he had heard, he told his wife, that, as the Earth is the mother  of all creatures, her bones must mean the stones.    Deucalion and Pyrrha, therefore, went slowly down the mountain, throwing  the stones behind them. The Greeks used to tell that a sturdy race of  men sprang up from the stones cast by Deucalion, while beautiful women  came from those cast by Pyrrha.    The country was soon peopled by the children of these men, who always  proudly declared that the story was true, and that they sprang from the  race which owed its birth to this great miracle. Deucalion reigned over  this people as long as he lived; and when he died, his two sons,  Am-phic'ty-on and Hel'len, became kings in his stead. The former staid  in Thessaly; and, hearing that some barbarians called Thra'cians were  about to come over the mountains and drive his people away, he called  the chiefs of all the different states to a council, to ask their advice  about the best means of defense. All the chiefs obeyed the summons, and  met at a place in Thessaly where the mountains approach the sea so  closely as to leave but a narrow pass between. In the pass are hot  springs, and so it was called Ther-mop'y-lae, or the Hot Gateway.    The chiefs thus gathered together called this assembly the  Am-phic-ty-on'ic Council, in honor of Amphictyon. After making plans to  drive back the Thracians, they decided to meet once a year, either at  Thermopylae or at the temple at Delphi, to talk over all important  matters.          V. STORY OF DAEDALUS AND ICARUS.      Hellen, Deucalion's second son, finding Thessaly too small to give homes  to all the people, went southward with a band of hardy followers, and  settled in another part of the country which we call Greece, but which  was then, in honor of him, called Hellas, while his people were called  Hel-le'nes, or subjects of Hellen.    When Hellen died, he left his kingdom to his three sons, Do'rus,  AE'o-lus, and Xu'thus. Instead of dividing their father's lands fairly,  the eldest two sons quarreled with the youngest, and finally drove him  away. Homeless and poor, Xuthus now went to Athens, where he was warmly  welcomed by the king, who not only treated him very kindly, but also  gave him his daughter in marriage, and promised that he should inherit  the throne.    This promise was duly kept, and Xuthus the exile ruled over Athens. When  he died, he left the crown to his sons, I'on and A-chae'us.    As the A-the'ni-ans had gradually increased in number until their  territory was too small to afford a living to all the inhabitants, Ion  and Achaeus, even in their father's lifetime, led some of their followers  along the Isthmus of Corinth, and down into the peninsula, where they  founded two flourishing states, called, after them, A-cha'ia and  I-o'ni-a. Thus, while northern Greece was pretty equally divided between  the Do'ri-ans and AE-o'li-ans, descendants and subjects of Dorus and  AEolus, the peninsula was almost entirely in the hands of the I-o'ni-ans  and A-chae'ans, who built towns, cultivated the soil, and became bold  navigators. They ventured farther and farther out at sea, until they  were familiar with all the neighboring bays and islands.    Sailing thus from place to place, the Hellenes came at last to Crete, a  large island south of Greece. This island was then governed by a very  wise king called Mi'nos. The laws of this monarch were so just that all  the Greeks admired them very much. When he died, they even declared that  the gods had called him away to judge the dead in Ha'des, and to decide  what punishments and rewards the spirits deserved.    Although Minos was very wise, he had a subject named Daed'a-lus who was  even wiser than he. This man not only invented the saw and the potter's  wheel, but also taught the people how to rig sails for their vessels.    As nothing but oars and paddles had hitherto been used to propel ships,  this last invention seemed very wonderful; and, to compliment Daedalus,  the people declared that he had given their vessels wings, and had thus  enabled them to fly over the seas.    Many years after, when sails were so common that they ceased to excite  any wonder, the people, forgetting that these were the wings which  Daedalus had made, invented a wonderful story, which runs as follows.    Minos, King of Crete, once sent for Daedalus, and bade him build a maze,  or labyrinth, with so many rooms and winding halls, that no one, once in  it, could ever find his way out again.    Daedalus set to work and built a maze so intricate that neither he nor  his son Ic'a-rus, who was with him, could get out. Not willing to  remain there a prisoner, Daedalus soon contrived a means of escape.    [Illustration: Daedalus and Icarus.]    He and Icarus first gathered together a large quantity of feathers, out  of which Daedalus cleverly made two pairs of wings. When these were  fastened to their shoulders by means of wax, father and son rose up like  birds and flew away. In spite of his father's cautions, Icarus rose  higher and higher, until the heat of the sun melted the wax, so that his  wings dropped off, and he fell into the sea and was drowned. His father,  more prudent than he, flew low, and reached Greece in safety. There he  went on inventing useful things, often gazing out sadly over the waters  in which Icarus had perished, and which, in honor of the drowned youth,  were long known as the I-ca'ri-an Sea.          VI. THE ADVENTURES OF JASON.      The Hellenes had not long been masters of all Greece, when a Phryg'i-an  called Pe'lops became master of the peninsula, which from him received  the name of Pel-o-pon-ne'sus. He first taught the people to coin money;  and his descendants, the Pe-lop'i-dae, took possession of all the land  around them, with the exception of Argolis, where the Da-na'i-des  continued to reign.    Some of the Ionians and Achaeans, driven away from their homes by the  Pelopidae, went on board their many vessels, and sailed away. They formed  Hel-len'ic colonies in the neighboring islands along the coast of Asia  Minor, and even in the southern part of Italy.    As some parts of Greece were very thinly settled, and as the people  clustered around the towns where their rulers dwelt, there were wide,  desolate tracts of land between them. Here were many wild beasts and  robbers, who lay in wait for travelers on their way from one settlement  to another. The robbers, who hid in the forests or mountains, were  generally feared and disliked, until at last some brave young warriors  made up their minds to fight against them and to kill them all. These  young men were so brave that they well deserved the name of heroes,  which has always been given them; and they met with many adventures  about which the people loved to hear. Long after they had gone, the  inhabitants, remembering their relief when the robbers were killed,  taught their children to honor these brave young men almost as much as  the gods, and they called the time when they lived the Heroic Age.    Not satisfied with freeing their own country from wild men and beasts,  the heroes wandered far away from home in search of further adventures.  These have also been told over and over again to children of all  countries and ages, until every one is expected to know something about  them. Fifty of these heroes, for instance, went on board of a small  vessel called the \"Argo,\" sailed across the well-known waters, and  ventured boldly into unknown seas. They were in search of a Golden  Fleece, which they were told they would find in Col'chis, where it was  said to be guarded by a great dragon.    The leader of these fifty adventurers was Ja'son, an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#3)"],[1,"of dark hair.  Powder-flask and pouch of tasty patterns; belt around the  waist, with hunting-knife and pistols--revolvers.  A light rifle in one  hand, and in the other a bridle-rein, which guided a steed of coal  blackness; one that would have been celebrated in song by a troubadour  of the olden time.  A deep Spanish saddle of stamped leather; holsters  with bearskin covers in front; a scarlet blanket, folded and strapped on  the croup; lazo and haversack hanging from the \"horn\"--_voila tout_!    There are two characters still undescribed.  Characters of no mean  importance were they--the \"guides.\"  They were called respectively,  Isaac Bradley and Mark Redwood.  A brace of trappers they were, but as  different from each other in personal appearance as two men could well  be.  Redwood was a man of large dimensions, and apparently as strong as  a buffalo, while his _confrere_ was a thin, wiry, sinewy mortal, with a  tough, weasel-like look and gait.  The expression of Redwood's  countenance was open and manly, his eyes were grey, his hair  light-coloured, and huge brown whiskers covered his cheeks.  Bradley, on  the other hand, was dark--his eyes small, black, and piercing--his face  as hairless as an Indian's, and bronzed almost to the Indian hue, with  the black hair of his head closely cropped around it.    Both these men were dressed in leather from head to foot, yet they were  very differently dressed.  Redwood wore the usual buckskin  hunting-shirt, leggings, and moccasins, but all of full proportions and  well cut, while his large 'coon-skin cap, with the plume-like tail, had  an imposing appearance.  Bradley's garments, on the contrary, were  tight-fitting and \"skimped.\"  His hunting-shirt was without cape, and  adhered so closely to his body that it appeared only an outer skin of  the man himself.  His leggings were pinched and tight.  Shirt, leggings,  and moccasins were evidently of the oldest kind, and as dirty as a  cobbler's apron.  A close-fitting otter cap, with a Mackinaw blanket,  completed the wardrobe of Isaac Bradley.  He was equipped with a pouch  of greasy leather hanging by an old black strap, a small buffalo-horn  suspended by a thong, and a belt of buffalo-leather, in which was stuck  a strong blade, with its handle of buckhorn.  His rifle was of the  \"tallest\" kind--being full six feet in height--in fact, taller than he  was, and at least four fifths of the weapon consisted of barrel.  The  straight narrow stock was a piece of manufacture that had proceeded from  the hands of the trapper himself.    Redwood's rifle was also a long one, but of more modern build and  fashion, and his equipments--pouch, powder-horn and belt--were of a more  tasty design and finish.    Such were our guides, Redwood and Bradley.  They were no imaginary  characters these.  Mark Redwood was a celebrated \"mountain-man\" at that  time, and Isaac Bradley will be recognised by many when I give him the  name and title by which he was then known,--viz. \"Old Ike, the  wolf-killer.\"    Redwood rode a strong horse of the half-hunter breed, while the  \"wolf-killer\" was mounted upon one of the scraggiest looking quadrupeds  it would be possible to imagine--an old mare \"mustang.\"        CHAPTER TWO.    THE CAMP AND CAMP-FIRE.    Our route was west by south.  The nearest point with which we expected  to fall in with the buffalo was two hundred miles distant.  We might  travel three hundred without seeing one, and even much farther at the  present day; but a report had reached Saint Louis that the buffalo had  been seen that year upon the Osage River, west of the Ozark Hills, and  towards that point we steered our course.  We expected in about twenty  days to fall in with the game.  Fancy a cavalcade of hunters making a  journey of twenty days to get upon the field!  The reader will, no  doubt, say we were in earnest.    At the time of which I am writing, a single day's journey from Saint  Louis carried the traveller clear of civilised life.  There were  settlements beyond; but these were sparse and isolated--a few small  towns or plantations upon the main watercourses--and the whole country  between them was an uninhabited wilderness.  We had no hope of being  sheltered by a roof until our return to the mound city itself, but we  had provided ourselves with a couple of tents, part of the freight of  our waggon.    There are but few parts of the American wilderness where the traveller  can depend upon wild game for a subsistence.  Even the skilled hunter  when stationary is sometimes put to his wits' end for \"daily bread.\"  Upon the \"route\" no great opportunity is found of killing game, which  always requires time to approach it with caution.  Although we passed  through what appeared to be excellent cover for various species of wild  animals, we reached our first camp without having ruffled either hair or  feathers.  In fact, neither bird nor quadruped had been seen, although  almost every one of the party had been on the look out for game during  most of the journey.    This was rather discouraging, and we reasoned that if such was to be our  luck until we got into the buffalo-range we should have a very dull time  of it.  We were well provisioned, however, and we regretted the absence  of game only on account of the sport.  A large bag of biscuit, and one  of flour, several pieces of \"hung bacon,\" some dry ox-tongues, a stock  of green coffee, sugar, and salt, were the principal and necessary  stores.  There were \"luxuries,\" too, which each had provided according  to his fancy, though not much of these, as every one of the party had  had some time or other in his life a little experience in the way of  \"roughing it.\"  Most of the loading of the waggon consisted of provender  for our horses and mules.    We made full thirty miles on the first day.  Our road was a good one.  We passed over easy undulations, most of them covered with \"black-jack.\"  This is a species of dwarf oak, so called from the very dark colour of  its wrinkled bark.  It is almost worthless as a timber, being too small  for most purposes.  It is ornamental, however, forming copse-like groves  upon the swells of the prairie, while its dark green foliage contrasts  pleasantly with the lighter green of the grasses beneath its shade.  The  young botanist, Besancon, had least cause to complain.  His time had  been sufficiently pleasant during the day.  New foliage fell under his  observation--new flowers opened their corollas to his delighted gaze.  He was aided in making his collections by the hunter-naturalist, who of  course was tolerably well versed in this kindred science.    We encamped by the edge of a small creek of clear water.  Our camp was  laid out in due form, and everything arranged in the order we designed  habitually to follow.    Every man unsaddled his own horse.  There are no servants in  prairie-land.  Even Lanty's services extended not beyond the _cuisine_,  and for this department he had had his training as the cook of a New  Orleans trading ship.  Jake had enough to do with his mules; and to have  asked one of our hunter-guides to perform the task of unsaddling your  horse, would have been a hazardous experiment.  Menial service to a free  trapper!  There are no servants in prairie-land.    Our horses and mules were picketed on a piece of open ground, each  having his \"trail-rope,\" which allowed a circuit of several yards.  The  two tents were pitched side by side, facing the stream, and the waggon  drawn up some twenty feet in the rear.  In the triangle between the  waggon and the tents was kindled a large fire, upon each side of which  two stakes, forked at the top, were driven into the ground.  A long  sapling resting in the forks traversed the blaze from side to side.  This was Lanty's \"crane,\"--the fire was his kitchen.    Let me sketch the camp more minutely, for our first camp was a type of  all the others in its general features.  Sometimes indeed the tents did  not front the same way, when these openings were set to \"oblige the  wind,\" but they were always placed side by side in front of the waggon.  They were small tents of the old-fashioned conical kind, requiring only  one pole each.  They were of sufficient size for our purpose, as there  were only three of us to each--the guides, with Jake and Lanty, finding  their lodgment under the tilt of the waggon.  With their graceful shape,  and snowy-white colour against the dark green foliage of the trees, they  formed an agreeable contrast; and a _coup d'oeil_ of the camp would have  been no mean picture to the eye of an artist.  The human figures may be  arranged in the following manner.    Supper is getting ready, and Lanty is decidedly at this time the most  important personage on the ground.  He is stooping over the fire, with a  small but long-handled frying-pan, in which he is parching the coffee.  It is already browned, and Lanty stirs it about with an iron spoon.  The  crane carries the large coffee-kettle of sheet iron, full of water upon  the boil; and a second frying-pan, larger than the first, is filled with  sliced ham, ready to be placed upon the hot cinders.    Our English friend Thompson is seated upon a log, with the hat-box  before him.  It is open, and he has drawn out from it his stock of combs  and brushes.  He has already made his ablutions, and is now giving the  finish to his toilet, by putting his hair, whiskers, moustache, teeth,  and even his nails, in order.  Your Englishman is the most comfortable  traveller in the world.    The Kentuckian is differently engaged.  He is upon his feet; in one hand  gleams a knife with ivory handle and long shining blade.  It is a  \"bowie,\" of that kind known as an \"Arkansas toothpick.\"  In the other  hand you see an object about eight inches in length, of the form of a  parallelogram, and of a dark brown colour.  It is a \"plug\" of real  \"James's River tobacco.\"  With his knife the Kentuckian cuts off a"]]]
