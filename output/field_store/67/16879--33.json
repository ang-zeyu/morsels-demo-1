Surely that can't be made to ring.\"     Sir Rat went on, nor stayed     To hear the jests they made;   And just outside the old cat's gate   He stopped and boldly braved his fate,     For if that cat     Should smell a rat   How quickly he'd come out and catch him,   And with what gusto he'd despatch him!   Sir Rat, against the picket-fence   Leaned the machine, then hurried hence,     And hid himself with glee,     And waited breathlessly       To see what that       Cantankerous cat   Would say, when in the twilight dim   He saw that brightly shining rim.       Sir Rat, though hidden quite,     And safely out of sight,   Had scarcely time to wink his eye,   When Mr. Cat came sauntering by.         \"Ha! Ha!\" said he,       \"What's this I see,   A bicycle! and just my size!   Well, this, indeed, is a surprise!       I'll confiscate       This treasure great;   How quickly I'll fly o'er the ground   When I pursue my hunting round!\"     He mounted it with eager haste,   It suited well his sporting taste;     He guided it at will,     And used the brake with skill,   He grasped the handle-bars, and then--   You see it was his custom when   He did a thing, to do it well--   Of course he used the clear-toned bell!     [Illustration]     Victory now! the deed is done!   No longer at the set of sun   The rats fly shrieking to their nests,   They saunter round with merry jests     And ne'er a thought of fear,       Knowing full well       They'll hear the bell     When Mr. Cat draws near.     [Illustration]     And young Sir Rat who did the deed,   Whose cleverness relieved their need,     His wondrous enterprise     Was lauded to the skies.   And everywhere his name   Was hailed with shouts of fame.     In difficulties, oft we see   Modern improvements frequently   Will prove a happy remedy.           The Rhyme of Triangular Tommy       [Illustration]     Triangular Tommy, one morning in May,   Went out for a walk on the public highway.       Just here I will say,       'Twas a bright sunny day,   And the sky it was blue, and the grass it was green,   The same sky and grass that you've all of you seen;   And the birds in the trees sang their usual song,   And Triangular Tommy went trudging along.         But I can tell you       He cared naught for the view.   He did just what small boys of his age always do:       He shouted out \"Scat!\"       At a wandering cat,   And he picked a big daisy to stick in his hat;       The clovers he topped,       And the toadstools he cropped,   And sometimes he scuffled and sometimes he hopped.     [Illustration]     He took an old stick and poked at a worm,   And merrily chuckled to see the thing squirm;   When he chanced to look up, and in gorgeous array   Triangular Tilly was coming his way.   Triangular Tom straightened up in a jiff,   And put on his best manner--exceedingly stiff;   And as far as his angular shape would allow   Triangular Tom made a beautiful bow.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]     [Illustration]     Triangular Tilly went smilingly by,   With a glance that was friendly, but just a bit shy.   And Tom so admired her that after she passed,   A backward look over his shoulder he cast.   And he said, \"Though I think many girls are but silly,   I really admire that Triangular Tilly.\"     [Illustration]     But soon all such thoughts were put out of his head,   For who should come by but Triangular Ted,   The very boy Tom had been wishing to see!   \"Hello!\" said Triangular Tommy, said he.   \"Hello!\" said Triangular Ted, and away   Those two children scooted to frolic and play.       And they had, on the green,       Where 'twas all dry and clean,   The best game of leap-frog that ever was seen.   Triangular Tom beat down this way, you know,   And Triangular Ted stood beside him, just so,       When one, two, three--go!       With  the  greatest gusto,   Ted flew over Tom in a manner not slow.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]     They played hide-and-seek, they played marbles and tag,   They played they were soldiers, and each waved a flag;       Till at last they confessed,       They wanted to rest;   So they sat down and chatted with laughter and jest;     [Illustration]     When Schoolmaster Jones they suddenly spied,   Come clumping along with his pedagogue stride,   As usual, with manner quite preoccupied;       With his hat on one side,       And his shoe-lace untied--   A surly old fellow, it can't be denied;       And each wicked boy       Thought that he would enjoy   An occasion the thoughtful old man to annoy,   And all of his wise calculations destroy.       So they thought they'd employ       A means known to each boy.   And across the wide pavement they fastened a twine   Exceedingly strong but exceedingly fine;   And Triangular Tommy laughed out in his glee,   To think how upset the old master would be!     [Illustration]     Although very wicked, their mischievous scheme   Was a perfect success; and with a loud scream,       A horrible clash,       A thump and a smash,   Old Schoolmaster Jones came down with a crash.   His hat rolled away, and his spectacles broke,   And those dreadful boys thought it a howling good joke.   And they just doubled up in immoderate glee,   Saying, \"Look at the Schoolmaster!       Tee-hee! tee-hee!\"     [Illustration]     [Illustration]         Tom gave a guffaw,       And Ted roared a \"haw-haw\";   But soon their diversion was turned into awe,   For old Schoolmaster Jones was angry, they saw.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]         Triangular Ted       Turned swiftly and fled,   And far down the street like a reindeer he sped,   Leaving Tommy to face the old gentleman's rage,   Who quickly jumped up,--he was brisk for his age,--   And with just indignation portrayed on his face,   To Triangular Tommy he quickly gave chase.     [Illustration]         And hearing his squeals       And his frantic appeals,   Triangular Tommy fast took to his heels.   Now Tommy was agile and Tommy was spry;   He whizzed through the air--he just seemed to fly;   He rushed madly on, until, dreadful to say!   He came where the railroad was just in his way--       And alas! and alack!       He tripped on the track   And then with a terrible, sudden ker-thwack!   Triangular Tommy sprawled flat on his back--   And the train came along with a crash, and a crack,   A din, and a clatter, a clang, and a clack,   A toot, and a boom, and a roar, and a hiss,   And chopped him up all into pieces like this--   If _you_ cut out papers just like them, why, then,   If you try, you can put him together again.     [Illustration]           A Modern Invention       Old Santa Claus is up-to-date,     And hereafter, rumors say,   He'll come with his pack of glittering toys,   And visit the homes of girls and boys,     In a new reindeerless sleigh.     [Illustration]           An April Joke       [Illustration]     Oh, it was a merry, gladsome day,   When the April Fool met the Queen of May;   She had roguish eyes and golden hair,   And they were a mischief-making pair.   They planned the funniest kind of a joke   On the poor, long-suffering mortal folk;   And a few mysterious words he said,   His fool's cap close to her flower-crowned head.   Then he laughed till he made his cap-bells ring,   At the thought of the topsy-turvy Spring.   \"'Tis a fair exchange,\" he said, with a wink--   \"It is!\" she said, and what do you think?   The flowers that should bloom in the month of May   Every one of them came on an April day!   And they looked for April showers in vain,   But all through May it did nothing but rain!

The Funny Kittens       [Illustration]     Once there were some silly kittens,   And they knitted woolly mittens     To bestow upon the freezing Hottentots.   But the Hottentots refused them,   Saying that they never used them     Unless crocheted of red with yellow spots.     [Illustration]     So the silly little kittens   Took their blue and white striped mittens     To a Bear who lived within a hollow tree;   The Bear responded sadly,   \"I would wear your mittens gladly,     But I fear they are too gay for such as me.\"     [Illustration]     Then the kittens, almost weeping,   Came to where a Cow lay sleeping,     And they woke her with this piteous request,   \"Won't you wear our mittens furry?\"   Said the Cow, \"My dears, don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24561"],[0,"A Report of the Debates and Proceedings in the Secret Sessions of the Conference (#3)"],[1,"wholly to organization. I hope we shall admit them, and I make  that motion.    Mr. SEDDON, of Virginia:--I hope this motion will not prevail. I do  not see that any good can possibly come of giving publicity now, to  our proceedings. On the contrary, in the present excited condition of  the country, I can see how much harm might result from that publicity.  It is not unlikely that wide differences of opinion will be found to  exist among us at the outset. These we shall attempt to harmonize, and  if we succeed, it will only be by mutual concessions and compromises.  Every one should be left free to make these concessions, and not  subject himself to unfavorable public criticism by doing so. If our  deliberations are to attain the successful conclusion we so much  desire, it certainly is the course of wisdom that we should follow the  illustrious example of the framers of the present Constitution, and  sit with closed doors.    The motion was thereupon, by _viva voce_ vote, decided in the  negative.    Mr. MEREDITH:--I move the appointment of a committee to consist of one  member from each delegation present, to be named by the delegation and  appointed by the President, who shall recommend permanent officers of  this, body, and also report rules for its government.    Which motion was agreed to.    The following gentlemen were then appointed such Committee on Rules  and Organization:    Kentucky, Charles A. Wickliffe, _Chairman_; New Hampshire, Amos Tuck;  Rhode Island, William W. Hoppin; New Jersey, Joseph F. Randolph;  Pennsylvania, Thomas E. Franklin; Delaware, George B. Rodney;  Maryland, John W. Crisfield; Virginia, William C. Rives; North  Carolina, Thomas Ruffin; Ohio, Reuben Hitchcock; Indiana, Godlove S.  Orth.    The Conference then adjourned to meet at 12 o'clock M. to-morrow.          SECOND DAY.    WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, _February 5th, 1861._      The Conference was called to order by the Chairman _pro tem._,  pursuant to adjournment, and the journal of the proceedings of the  first day was read and approved.    Mr. FRANKLIN, of Pennsylvania:--It is usual in bodies of this  description to take measures to ascertain who are and who are not duly  accredited members. We should have the names of all the Commissioners  present brought on to our records. I therefore move that a Committee  of five be appointed by the Chairman, to whom all credentials of  members shall be referred for examination and report.    The motion of Mr. FRANKLIN was adopted unanimously, and the Chairman  announced as such Committee Mr. Summers, of Virginia; Mr. Franklin, of  Pennsylvania; Mr. Guthrie, of Kentucky; Mr. Morehead, of North  Carolina, and Mr. Smith, of Indiana.    Mr. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky:--I rise at this time for the purpose of  making the report of the Committee on Organization. I am instructed to  report that we recommend that the permanent officers of the Convention  be a President and Secretary, and that the Secretary have leave to  appoint assistants, not exceeding two in number, to assist him in the  discharge of his duties; and that the President of this Convention be  JOHN TYLER, of Virginia, and that CRAFTS J. WRIGHT, of Ohio, be its  Secretary. The committee also report a series of rules for the  government of the Convention.    Mr. CLAY, of Kentucky:--I move that the question upon accepting the  report be divided, and that it be first taken on that part of the  report which relates to the officers of the Convention.    Which was agreed to without objection.    It was then moved, and unanimously voted, that the part of the report  relating to officers, be accepted, and the officers designated be  appointed.    The President _pro tem._ then appointed Mr. EWING, of Ohio, and Mr.  MEREDITH, of Pennsylvania, to conduct the President elect to the  chair.    President TYLER upon taking his seat proceeded to address the  Convention as follows:    Gentlemen, I fear you have committed a great error in appointing me to  the honorable position you have assigned me. A long separation from  all deliberative bodies has rendered the rules of their proceedings  unfamiliar to me, while I should find, in my own state of health,  variable and fickle as it is, sufficient reason to decline the honor  of being your presiding officer. But, in times like these, one has but  little option left him. Personal considerations should weigh but  lightly in the balance. The country is in danger; it is enough; one  must take the place assigned him in the great work of reconciliation  and adjustment. The voice of Virginia has invited her co-States to  meet her in council. In the initiation of this Government, that same  voice was heard and complied with, and the results of seventy-odd  years have fully attested the wisdom of the decisions then adopted. Is  the urgency of her call now less great than it was then? Our godlike  fathers created, we have to preserve. They built up, through their  wisdom and patriotism, monuments which have eternized their names. You  have before you, gentlemen, a task equally grand, equally sublime,  quite as full of glory and immortality. You have to snatch from ruin a  great and glorious Confederation, to preserve the Government, and to  renew and invigorate the Constitution. If you reach the height of this  great occasion, your children's children will rise up and call you  blessed. I confess myself to be ambitious of sharing in the glory of  accomplishing this grand and magnificent result. To have our names  enrolled in the Capitol, to be repeated by future generations with  grateful applause--this is an honor higher than the mountains, more  enduring than the monumental alabaster. Yes, Virginia's voice, as in  the olden time, has been heard. Her sister States meet her this day at  the council board. Vermont is here, bringing with her the memories of  the past, and reviving in the memories of all, her Ethan Allen and his  demand for the surrender of Ticonderoga, in the name of the Great  Jehovah and the American Congress. New Hampshire is here, her fame  illustrated by memorable annals, and still more lately as the  birthplace of him who won for himself the name of defender of the  Constitution, and who wrote that letter to John Taylor which has been  enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen. Massachusetts is not here.  (Some member said \"She is coming.\") I hope so, said Mr. TYLER, and  that she will bring with her her daughter Maine. I did not believe it  could well be that the voice which in other times was so familiar to  her ears had been addressed to her in vain. Connecticut is here, and  she comes, I doubt not, in the spirit of ROGER SHERMAN, whose name  with our very children has become a household word, and who was in  life the embodiment of that sound practical sense which befits the  great lawgiver and constructer of governments. Rhode Island, the land  of ROGER WILLIAMS, is here, one of the two last States, in her  jealousy of the public liberty, to give in her adhesion to the  Constitution, and among the earliest to hasten to its rescue. The  great Empire State of New York, represented thus far but by one  delegate, is expected daily in fuller force to join in the great work  of healing the discontents of the times and restoring the reign of  fraternal feeling. New Jersey is also here, with the memories of the  past covering her all over. Trenton and Princeton live immortal in  story, the plains of the last incrimsoned with the hearts blood of  Virginia's sons. Among her delegation I rejoice to recognize a gallant  son of a signer of the immortal Declaration which announced to the  world that thirteen Provinces had become thirteen independent and  sovereign States. And here, too, is Delaware, the land of the BAYARDS  and the RODNEYS, whose soil at Brandywine was moistened by the blood  of Virginia's youthful MONROE. Here is Maryland, whose massive columns  wheeled into line with those of Virginia in the contest for glory,  and whose state house at Annapolis was the theatre of the spectacle of  a successful Commander, who, after liberating his country, gladly  ungirthed his sword, and laid it down upon the altar of that country.  Then comes Pennsylvania, rich in revolutionary lore, bringing with her  the deathless names of FRANKLIN and MORRIS, and, I trust, ready to  renew from the belfry of Independence Hall the chimes of the old bell,  which announced _Freedom_ and _Independence_ in former days. All hail  to North Carolina! with her Mecklenberg Declaration in her hand,  standing erect on the ground of her own probity and firmness in the  cause of public liberty, and represented in her attributes by her  MACON, and in this assembly by her distinguished son at no great  distance from me. Four daughters of Virginia also cluster around the  council board on the invitation of their ancient mother--the eldest,  Kentucky, whose sons, under the intrepid warrior ANTHONY WAYNE, gave  freedom of settlement to the territory of her sister, Ohio. She  extends her hand daily and hourly across _la belle riviere_, to grasp  the hand of some one of kindred blood of the noble states of Indiana,  and Illinois, and Ohio, who have grown up into powerful States,  already grand, potent, and almost imperial. Tennessee is not here, but  is coming--prevented only from being here by the floods which have  swollen her rivers. When she arrives, she will wear the badges on her  warrior crest of victories won in company with the Great West on many  an ensanguined plain, and standards torn from the hands of the  conquerors at Waterloo. Missouri, and Iowa, and Michigan, Wisconsin,  and Minnesota, still linger behind, but it may be hoped that their  hearts are with us in the great work we have to do.    Gentlemen, the eyes of the whole country are turned to this assembly,  in expectation and hope. I trust that you may prove yourselves worthy  of the great occasion. Our ancestors, probably, committed a blunder in  not"]]]
