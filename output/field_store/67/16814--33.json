Harriss    [TR: No Date Stamp]    [HW: Unnumbered]    STORY OF JOSEPH ANDERSON    1113 Rankin Street  Wilmington, N. C.      Yes'm I was born a slave. I belong to Mr. T. C. McIlhenny who had a big  rice plantation \"Eagles Nest\" in Brunswick County. It was a big place.  He had lots of slaves, an' he was a good man. My mother and father died  when I was fourteen. Father died in February 1865 and my mother died of  pneumonia in November 1865. My older sister took charge of me.    Interviewer: \"Can you read and write?\"    Joseph: \"Oh yes, I can write a little. I can make my marks. I can write  my name. No'm I can't read. I never went to school a day in my life. I  just \"picked up\" what I know.\"    I don't remember much about slave times. I was fourteen when I was  freed. After I was freed we lived between 8th and 9th on Chestnut. We  rented a place from Dan O'Connor a real estate man and paid him $5 a  month rent. I've been married twice. First time was married by Mr. Ed  Taylor, magistrate in Southport, Brunswick County. I was married to my  first wife twenty years and eight months. Then she died. I was married  again when I was seventy-five years old. I was married to my second wife  just a few years when she died.    I was on the police force for a year and a half. I was elected April 6,  1895. Mr. McIlhenny was an ole man then an' I used to go to see him.    I was a stevedore for Mr. Alexander Sprunt for sixty years.    Joseph is now buying his house at 1113 Rankin Street. Rents part of it  for $8.50 a month to pay for it. He stays in one room.    NOTE: Joseph's health is none too good, making information sketchy and  incoherent.          N. C.

L. Andrews    [TR: Date Stamp \"AUG 23 1937\"]    MARY ANDERSON    86 years of age. 17 Poole Road, R. F. D. #2. Raleigh, N. C.      My name is Mary Anderson. I was born on a plantation near Franklinton,  Wake County, N. C. May 10, 1851. I was a slave belonging to Sam Brodie,  who owned the plantation at this place. My missus' name was Evaline. My  father was Alfred Brodie and my mother was Bertha Brodie.    We had good food, plenty of warm homemade clothes and comfortable  houses. The slave houses were called the quarters and the house where  marster lived was called the great house. Our houses had two rooms each  and marster's house had twelve rooms. Both the slave and white folks  buildings were located in a large grove one mile square covered with oak  and hickory nut trees. Marster's house was exactly one mile from the  main Louisburg Road and there was a wide avenue leading through the  plantation and grove to marster's house. The house fronted the avenue  east and in going down the avenue from the main road you traveled  directly west.    The plantation was very large and there were about two hundred acres of  cleared land that was farmed each year. A pond was located on the place  and in winter ice was gathered there for summer use and stored in an ice  house which was built in the grove where the other buildings were. A  large hole about ten feet deep was dug in the ground; the ice was put in  that hole and covered. [TR: HW note in left margin is illegible.]    A large frame building was built over it. At the top of the earth there  was an entrance door and steps leading down to the bottom of the hole.  Other things besides ice were stored there. There was a still on the  plantation and barrels of brandy were stored in the ice house, also  pickles, preserves and cider.    Many of the things we used were made on the place. There was a grist  mill, tannery, shoe shop, blacksmith shop, and looms for weaving cloth.    There were about one hundred, and sixty-two slaves on the plantation  and every Sunday morning all the children had to be bathed, dressed, and  their hair combed and carried down to marster's for breakfast. It was a  rule that all the little colored children eat at the great house every  Sunday morning in order that marster and missus could watch them eat so  they could know which ones were sickly and have them doctored.    The slave children all carried a mussel shell in their hands to eat  with. The food was put on large trays and the children all gathered  around and ate, dipping up their food with their mussel shells which  they used for spoons. Those who refused to eat or those who were ailing  in any way had to come back to the great house for their meals and  medicine until they were well.    Marster had a large apple orchard in the Tar River low grounds and up  on higher ground and nearer the plantation house there was on one side  of the road a large plum orchard and on the other side was an orchard of  peaches, cherries, quinces and grapes. We picked the quinces in August  and used them for preserving. Marster and missus believed in giving the  slaves plenty of fruit, especially the children.    Marster had three children, one boy named Dallas, and two girls, Bettie  and Carrie. He would not allow slave children to call his children  marster and missus unless the slave said little marster or little  missus. He had four white overseers but they were not allowed to whip a  slave. If there was any whipping to be done he always said he would do  it. He didn't believe in whipping so when a slave got so bad he could  not manage him he sold him.    Marster didn't quarrel with anybody, missus would not speak short to a  slave, but both missus and marster taught slaves to be obedient in a  nice quiet way. The slaves were taught to take their hats and bonnets  off before going into the house, and to bow and say, 'Good morning  Marster Sam and Missus Evaline'. Some of the little negroes would go  down to the great house and ask them when it wus going to rain, and when  marster or missus walked in the grove the little Negroes would follow  along after them like a gang of kiddies. Some of the slave children  wanted to stay with them at the great house all the time. They knew no  better of course and seemed to love marster and missus as much as they  did their own mother and father. Marster and missus always used gentle  means to get the children out of their way when they bothered them and  the way the children loved and trusted them wus a beautiful sight to  see.    Patterollers were not allowed on the place unless they came peacefully  and I never knew of them whipping any slaves on marster's place. Slaves  were carried off on two horse wagons to be sold. I have seen several  loads leave. They were the unruly ones. Sometimes he would bring back  slaves, once he brought back two boys and three girls from the slave  market.    Sunday wus a great day on the plantation. Everybody got biscuits  Sundays. The slave women went down to marsters for their Sunday  allowance of flour. All the children ate breakfast at the great house  and marster and missus gave out fruit to all. The slaves looked forward  to Sunday as they labored through the week. It was a great day. Slaves  received good treatment from marster and all his family.    We were allowed to have prayer meetings in our homes and we also went  to the white folks church.    They would not teach any of us to read and write. Books and papers were  forbidden. Marster's children and the slave children played together. I  went around with the baby girl Carrie to other plantations visiting. She  taught me how to talk low and how to act in company. My association with  white folks and my training while I was a slave is why I talk like white  folks.    Bettie Brodie married a Dr. Webb from Boylan, Virginia. Carrie married  a Mr. Joe Green of Franklin County. He was a big southern planter.    The war was begun and there were stories of fights and freedom. The  news went from plantation to plantation and while the slaves acted  natural and some even more polite than usual, they prayed for freedom.  Then one day I heard something that sounded like thunder and missus and  marster began to walk around and act queer. The grown slaves were  whispering to each other. Sometimes they gathered in little gangs in the  grove. Next day I heard it again, boom, boom, boom. I went and asked  missus 'is it going to rain?' She said, 'Mary go to the ice house and  bring me some pickles and preserves.' I went and got them. She ate a  little and gave me some. Then she said, 'You run along and play."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22990"],[0,"Historical Sketch of the Cathedral of Strasburg (#3)"],[1,"in 1793; in their fury of levelling, the  men who then ruled the country caused two hundred and thirty four  effigies of saints and kings to be taken down from their niches,  of which very few only were saved; the crazy jacobin Teterel even  proposed pulling down the spire, because, by its height extending  far beyond that of the ordinary houses, it was condemning the  principle of equality; the motion not being carried on. Teterel  obtained the assurance at least, that a large red cap made of tin  should be placed on the top of the Cathedral, and it was to be  seen among other curiosities in the town-library, before its  destruction.    The year 1870, so full of important events for Strasburg, was  also fatal for the Cathedral, and during the seven weeks'  cannonading of the town the beautiful building was constantly  threatened with ruin. In the first period of the siege of  Strasburg, the Germans tried to force the surrender by the  bombardment and partial destruction of the inner town. In  the night of the 23rd of August began for the frightened  inhabitants the real time of terror; however that night the rising  conflagrations, for instance in St. Thomas' church, were quickly  put out. But in the following night the New-Church, the Library  of the town, the Museum of paintings and many of the finest  houses became a heap of ruins, and under the hail of shells all  efforts to extinguish the fire were useless. For the Cathedral  the night from the 25th to 26th of August was the worst. Towards  midnight the flames broke out from the roof perforated by shells,  and increased by the melting copper, they rose to a fearful  height beside the pyramid of the spire. The sight of this grand  volume of flames, rising above the town, was indescribable and  tinged the whole sky with its glowing reflection. And the guns  went on thundering and shattering parts of the stone ornaments  which adorned the front and sides of the Cathedral. The whole  roof came down and the fire died out only for want of fuel. The  following morning the ground in the interior was covered with  ruins, and through the holes in the vault of the nave one could  see the blue sky. The beautiful Organ built by Silbermann was  pierced by a shell and the magnificent painted windows were in  great part spoiled. Fortunately the celebrated astronomical Clock  had escaped unhurt.    As the Military Command continued for some time to occupy a post  of observation on the platform, the Cathedral was unfortunately  still longer the aim of German guns which every day surrounded  the building with ruins. On the 4th of September two shells hit  the crown of the Cathedral and hurled the stonemasses to  incredible distances; on the 15th a shot came even into the point  below the Cross, which was bent on one side, and had its  threatened fall only prevented by the iron bars of the lightning  conductor which held it.    After the entrance of the Germans into the reconquered town, the  difficult and dangerous work of restauration of the point of the  spire was begun at once and happily ended a few months after.  They work also constantly to make the other damages disappear,  and in a short time the magnificent house of God will be restored  to all its ancient splendour.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: The Crypta.]    II. DESCRIPTION.      The first aspect of the Cathedral produces on the mind a deep  impression. One is seized with admiration and amazed at the first  view of this noble edifice whose steeple towers up so gracefully  and majestically. No doubt that examined in all its particular  parts, one may also be struck with the disproportion that exists  between them; the nave is not in harmony with the dimensions of  the tower, the chancel and transept still less so: but although  this want of uniformity may lessen the symmetry of the monument,  the impression it at first produces is no less extraordinary. And  besides, have not those different styles a particular interest  for those who study the history of architecture? In the Cathedral  are, as it were, brought together all the styles or orders of  architecture of the middle ages, from the byzantine art with its  grave simplicity, down to the last glimmerings of the gothic  art, now declining, and its works lined with an excess of  superfluous ornaments. The byzantine taste prevails in the first  constructions of the chancel and aisles and even somewhat in the  lower part of the nave; higher up, the style in which the ogive  was built extends to the other constructions and finally succeeds  to the former entirely.    The _facade_ of the church, of an imposing magnitude, cannot  be sufficiently admired; the massive walls are hidden by  _clochetoons_, arcades, small pillars and innumerable statues;  these decorations all wrought to great perfection, give to that  part of the edifice a nicety that makes it resemble a work coming  from the hands of a chaser. But how to describe, in the short  space which the limits of this sketch admit, all the details, all  the particular parts of our Cathedral? There is in it such a  profusion, such a richness, that to be properly explored, it  would require volumes. We must therefore limit ourselves to some  brief indications of the most interesting and essential parts[1].  Moreover a description of all the allegorical statues and figures  that adorn particularly the inferior parts of the building, would  be here so much the more superfluous, as an intelligent spectator  may easily understand them. All these fine ornaments are meant to  symbolize the mysteries of Redemption, taken from the principal  facts in Scripture and from the fundamental doctrines of the  christian faith. In this respect the lower tier is the most  remarkable; the middle one has neither the same beauty nor the  same religious signification; the third is the least satisfactory  both as regards execution and artistical conception.      [1] We refer the reader who wishes to study the Cathedral in    all its parts, to the following works: Grandidier, _Essais    historiques et topographiques sur l'eglise Cathedrale de    Strasbourg_, Strasb. 1782, in 8o.--H.

We regret to    say that but one number of this fine work has been published    (in 1839).--_Kunst und Alterthum in Elsass-Lothringen_, von    Prot. F. X. Kraus, I. Band. With numerous wood-engravings. 1877.    [Illustration: Porch of Saint-Lawrence.]    The whole of the facade is formed of the two fore-parts of the  northern and southern towers and of the large central porch;  these three distinct portions are separated by counterforts or  pillars which divide, as it were, the frontispiece into three  broad vertical bands, each of which has its portico. These  porticos and their frontons are ornamented with a great many  statues and bas-reliefs, some of which pulled down during the  revolution, have since been replaced. The large figures in the  left portico are twelve virgins, wearing diadems and trampling  down human forms representing the seven deadly sins. On both  sides of the right hand portico are seen the ten virgins of the  parable; to the group of the wise virgins on the right is joined  the statue of Jesus-Christ; the foolish virgins composing the  group on the left side, have among them an allegoric figure  expressing the lust of the world: on her head is a wreath, in one  hand she holds an apple, the ancient symbol of lust; her back  bears hideous vipers, to portray the sad fate which must be the  inevitable result of inordinate earthly desires.    All these statues, now blackened by the centuries that have  passed over them, have all a stern appearance, like those that  deck the magnificent middle porch representing either prophets of  the Old Testament, Apostles or fathers of the Church. In the  arches of these three porticos are figures of a smaller size,  which like the bas-reliefs of the tympans, exhibit either scenes  taken from Scripture, or saints and angels. In the tympan on the  right hand door, Jesus is seen seated on a rain-bow, and over him  is the Resurrection of the dead and the Judgment-day. On the  butting pillar that divides both folds of the middle porch[1], is  placed a blessed Virgin holding an infant Christ in her arms. The  fronton of this portal is formed by two triangles and adorned  with many figures; that on the summit of the interior triangle,  which first strikes the eye, is king Solomon seated under a  canopy; on both sides of him are fourteen lions raised on steps  or benches that draw near towards the top and join near a Virgin  Mary sitting with the infant Christ on one arm and holding a  globe in her other hand; she is the Patroness of the church.  Above her a radiated head, representing God the Father, forms the  point of the triangle that encircles the inside fronton, which is  decked with figures playing on different musical instruments. On  the sides facing the North and South, the two towers have each a  large window with most beautiful _rosaces_. Over the window on  the South side is seen a very old sculpture, the grotesque  figures of which represent the night revelling of sorcerers. The  frontons of the other porticos are also adorned with _rosaces_.      [1] The beautiful folds of the middle door, mounted with artful    bronze ornaments which were executed in Paris after the designs    of the architect of our cathedral, Mr. Klotz, were hung up in    1879.    On the second tier of the middle porch is a large rose-window  that occupies the whole width of it. It is surrounded by a  detached "]]]
