[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25172"],[0,"Moral Principles in Education (#3)"],[1,"seem to be a  fable made expressly for the purpose of typifying the ethical  relationship of school to society. The school cannot be a preparation  for social life excepting as it reproduces, within itself, typical  conditions of social life. At present it is largely engaged in the  futile task of Sisyphus. It is endeavoring to form habits in children  for use in a social life which, it would almost seem, is carefully and  purposely kept away from vital contact with the child undergoing  training. The only way to prepare for social life is to engage in social  life. To form habits of social usefulness and serviceableness apart from  any direct social need and motive, apart from any existing social  situation, is, to the letter, teaching the child to swim by going  through motions outside of the water. The most indispensable condition  is left out of account, and the results are correspondingly partial.    The much lamented separation in the schools of intellectual and moral  training, of acquiring information and growing in character, is simply  one expression of the failure to conceive and construct the school as a  social institution, having social life and value within itself. Except  so far as the school is an embryonic typical community life, moral  training must be partly pathological and partly formal. Training is  pathological when stress is laid upon correcting wrong-doing instead of  upon forming habits of positive service. Too often the teacher's concern  with the moral life of pupils takes the form of alertness for failures  to conform to school rules and routine. These regulations, judged from  the standpoint of the development of the child at the time, are more or  less conventional and arbitrary. They are rules which have to be made in  order that the existing modes of school work may go on; but the lack of  inherent necessity in these school modes reflects itself in a feeling,  on the part of the child, that the moral discipline of the school is  arbitrary. Any conditions that compel the teacher to take note of  failures rather than of healthy growth give false standards and result  in distortion and perversion. Attending to wrong-doing ought to be an  incident rather than a principle. The child ought to have a positive  consciousness of what he is about, so as to judge his acts from the  standpoint of reference to the work which he has to do. Only in this way  does he have a vital standard, one that enables him to turn failures to  account for the future.    By saying that the moral training of the school is formal, I mean that  the moral habits currently emphasized by the school are habits which are  created, as it were, _ad hoc_. Even the habits of promptness,  regularity, industry, non-interference with the work of others,  faithfulness to tasks imposed, which are specially inculcated in the  school, are habits that are necessary simply because the school system  is what it is, and must be preserved intact. If we grant the  inviolability of the school system as it is, these habits represent  permanent and necessary moral ideas; but just in so far as the school  system is itself isolated and mechanical, insistence upon these moral  habits is more or less unreal, because the ideal to which they relate is  not itself necessary. The duties, in other words, are distinctly school  duties, not life duties. If we compare this condition with that of the  well-ordered home, we find that the duties and responsibilities that the  child has there to recognize do not belong to the family as a  specialized and isolated institution, but flow from the very nature of  the social life in which the family participates and to which it  contributes. The child ought to have the same motives for right doing  and to be judged by the same standards in the school, as the adult in  the wider social life to which he belongs. Interest in community  welfare, an interest that is intellectual and practical, as well as  emotional--an interest, that is to say, in perceiving whatever makes for  social order and progress, and in carrying these principles into  execution--is the moral habit to which all the special school habits  must be related if they are to be animated by the breath of life.          THE MORAL TRAINING FROM METHODS OF INSTRUCTION          III    THE MORAL TRAINING FROM METHODS OF INSTRUCTION      The principle of the social character of the school as the basic factor  in the moral education given may be also applied to the question of  methods of instruction,--not in their details, but their general spirit.  The emphasis then falls upon construction and giving out, rather than  upon absorption and mere learning. We fail to recognize how essentially  individualistic the latter methods are, and how unconsciously, yet  certainly and effectively, they react into the child's ways of judging  and of acting. Imagine forty children all engaged in reading the same  books, and in preparing and reciting the same lessons day after day.  Suppose this process constitutes by far the larger part of their work,  and that they are continually judged from the standpoint of what they  are able to take in in a study hour and reproduce in a recitation hour.  There is next to no opportunity for any social division of labor. There  is no opportunity for each child to work out something specifically his  own, which he may contribute to the common stock, while he, in turn,  participates in the productions of others. All are set to do exactly the  same work and turn out the same products. The social spirit is not  cultivated,--in fact, in so far as the purely individualistic method  gets in its work, it atrophies for lack of use. One reason why reading  aloud in school is poor is that the real motive for the use of  language--the desire to communicate and to learn--is not utilized. The  child knows perfectly well that the teacher and all his fellow pupils  have exactly the same facts and ideas before them that he has; he is not  _giving_ them anything at all. And it may be questioned whether the  moral lack is not as great as the intellectual. The child is born with a  natural desire to give out, to do, to serve. When this tendency is not  used, when conditions are such that other motives are substituted, the  accumulation of an influence working against the social spirit is much  larger than we have any idea of,--especially when the burden of work,  week after week, and year after year, falls upon this side.    But lack of cultivation of the social spirit is not all. Positively  individualistic motives and standards are inculcated. Some stimulus must  be found to keep the child at his studies. At the best this will be his  affection for his teacher, together with a feeling that he is not  violating school rules, and thus negatively, if not positively, is  contributing to the good of the school. I have nothing to say against  these motives so far as they go, but they are inadequate. The relation  between the piece of work to be done and affection for a third person is  external, not intrinsic. It is therefore liable to break down whenever  the external conditions are changed. Moreover, this attachment to a  particular person, while in a way social, may become so isolated and  exclusive as to be selfish in quality. In any case, the child should  gradually grow out of this relatively external motive into an  appreciation, for its own sake, of the social value of what he has to  do, because of its larger relations to life, not pinned down to two or  three persons.    But, unfortunately, the motive is not always at this relative best, but  mixed with lower motives which are distinctly egoistic. Fear is a motive  which is almost sure to enter in,--not necessarily physical fear, or  fear of punishment, but fear of losing the approbation of others; or  fear of failure, so extreme as to be morbid and paralyzing. On the other  side, emulation and rivalry enter in. Just because all are doing the  same work, and are judged (either in recitation or examination with  reference to grading and to promotion) not from the standpoint of their  personal contribution, but from that of _comparative_ success, the  feeling of superiority over others is unduly appealed to, while timid  children are depressed. Children are judged with reference to their  capacity to realize the same external standard. The weaker gradually  lose their sense of power, and accept a position of continuous and  persistent inferiority. The effect upon both self-respect and respect  for work need not be dwelt upon. The strong learn to glory, not in their  strength, but in the fact that they are stronger. The child is  prematurely launched into the region of individualistic competition, and  this in a direction where competition is least applicable, namely, in  intellectual and artistic matters, whose law is cooperation and  participation.    Next, perhaps, to the evils of passive absorption and of competition for  external standing come, perhaps, those which result from the eternal  emphasis upon preparation for a remote future. I do not refer here to  the waste of energy and vitality that accrues when children, who live so  largely in the immediate present, are appealed to in the name of a dim  and uncertain future which means little or nothing to them. I have in  mind rather the habitual procrastination that develops when the motive  for work is future, not present; and the false standards of judgment  that are created when work is estimated, not on the basis of present  need and present responsibility, but by reference to an external result,  like passing an examination, getting promoted, entering high school,  getting into college, etc. Who can reckon up the loss of moral power  that arises from the constant impression that nothing is worth doing in  itself, but only as a preparation for something else, which in turn is  only a getting ready for some genuinely serious end"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#3)"],[1," pale and  agitated.  Norman felt his heart sink when he saw him; a groan broke from  him as the Doctor spoke:    'She is much worse!  I am in great fear that she may pass away before the  morning!'  The Squire's strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse veil as  he asked:    'May I see her?'    'Not yet; at present she is sleeping.  She may wake strengthened; in  which case you may see her.  But if not--'    'If not?'--the voice was not like his own.    'Then I shall send for you at once!'  The Doctor returned to his vigil.  The Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his hands; his  great shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.    An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to the  door:    'Well?'    'You had better come now.'    'Is she better?'    'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my dear  old friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can do now  is to make her last moments happy.'    'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion  wondered.    When they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes opened  and she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a  glad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She motioned to him  to bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his  arms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength  he would shield her from all harm.  Her voice came very low and in broken  gasps; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak:    'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me so  happy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will  suffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our  little one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will have no mother; you  will have to be father and mother too.'    'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'  He  could hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:    'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on  your name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there was  exultation in her weak voice as she said:    'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the name  we both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly  on the babe as he said:    'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her breast,  will be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life long I  shall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--as you and I  love each other!'    She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her  child.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round his neck,  and their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.          CHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD      For some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with  grief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the routine of his  life; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of  bearing his loss with resignation.  But within, all was desolation.    Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's  heart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms  must have realised with all its senses that, in all that it saw and heard  and touched, there was nothing but love and help and protection.  Gradually the trust was followed by expectation.  If by some chance the  father was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient  and cast persistent, longing glances at the door.  When he came all was  joy.    Time went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the  growth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of nature's  growth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so many years,  that they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But his baby was one  and one only.  Any change in it was not only in itself a new experience,  but brought into juxtaposition what is with what was.  The changes that  began to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him, for they  were unexpected.  In the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special  import; to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.  But, little by  little, came the tiny changes which convention has established.  And with  each change came to Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child  was a woman.  A tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and  protection and devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty  little ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the  childish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were  all but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father,  after all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge.    At first there was through all his love for his child a certain  resentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply  to give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it the habit  of its acknowledgment, there came also a certain resignation, which is  the halting-place for satisfaction.  But he never, not then nor  afterwards, quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son.  Could there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his wife's eyes  and of her faint voice, of her hope and her faith, as she placed her baby  in his arms would have refused it a resting-place.  This belief tinged  all his after-life and moulded his policy with regard to his girl's  upbringing.  If she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she  must from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways.  This, in that she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to  accomplish.  Had she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would  soon have found their own level.    There was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the  conventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia Rowly,  who took after a time, in so far as such a place could be taken, that of  the child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of  Norwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own  senior.  When the old Squire's second wife had died, Laetitia, then a  conceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken possession of the young  Margaret.  When Margaret had married Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well  satisfied; for she had known Stephen Norman all her life.  Though she  could have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would  be hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also  she knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the  happiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance  of true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been  travelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death came  to her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking  care of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of Margaret.  For  several reasons this could not be done in the same way.  She was not old  enough to go and live at Normanstand without exciting comment; and the  Squire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere  except in his own house.  Educational supervision, exercised at such  distance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor exact.    Though Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early in  life manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to her  father, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and  daughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her  imperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine  fashion, and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early  grasped the possibilities of her own will.  She learned the measure of  her nurse's foot and then of her father's; and so, knowing where lay the  bounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes, she at once  avoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the  limit of her tether.    It is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in  this limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good  temper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a  rule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a  habit.    Miss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it was  who selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time  as to the child's progress.  Not often was there any complaint, for the  little thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a  manifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, that it  would have been hard to name a specific fault.    But though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with eminently  satisfactory emoluments and references, there came an irregularly timed  succession of governesses.    Stephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the  changes.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The  child's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong ones,  or would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman who had  never had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as though the  child's hand was gripping her heart.    With her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be pleased  when she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being like one  insensibly grew on her.    An only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true learning is  not that which we are taught, but that which we take in for ourselves  from experience and observation, and children's experiences and  observation,"]]]
