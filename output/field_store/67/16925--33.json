By no means; but heavenly Clouds, great divinities       to idle men; who supply us with thought and argument,       and intelligence and humbug, and circumlocution, and       ability to hoax, and comprehension.         Strep. On this account therefore my soul, having heard       their voice, flutters, and already seeks to discourse       subtilely, and to quibble about smoke, and having       pricked a maxim with a little notion, to refute the       opposite argument. So that now I eagerly desire, if by       any means it be possible, to see them palpably.         Soc. Look, then, hither, toward Mount Parnes;  for now I       behold them descending gently.         Strep. Pray where? Show me.         Soc. See! There they come in great numbers through the       hollows and thickets; there, obliquely.         Strep. What's the matter? For I can't see them.         Soc. By the entrance.         [Enter Chorus]         Strep. Now at length with difficulty I just see them.         Soc. Now at length you assuredly see them, unless you       have your eyes running pumpkins.         Strep. Yes, by Jupiter! O highly honoured Clouds, for       now they cover all things.         Soc. Did you not, however, know, nor yet consider, these       to be goddesses?         Strep. No, by Jupiter! But I thought them to be mist,       and dew, and smoke.         Soc. For you do not know, by Jupiter! that these feed       very many sophists, Thurian soothsayers, practisers of       medicine, lazy-long-haired-onyx-ring-wearers,       song-twisters for the cyclic dances, and meteorological       quacks. They feed idle people who do nothing, because       such men celebrate them in verse.         Strep. For this reason, then, they introduced into their       verses \"the dreadful impetuosity of the moist,       whirling-bright clouds\"; and the \"curls of       hundred-headed Typho\"; and the \"hard-blowing tempests\";       and then \"aerial, moist\"; \"crooked-clawed birds,       floating in air\"; and \"the showers of rain from dewy       Clouds\". And then, in return for these, they swallow       \"slices of great, fine mullets, and bird's-flesh of       thrushes.\"         Soc. Is it not just, however, that they should have       their reward, on account of these?         Strep. Tell me, pray, if they are really clouds, what       ails them, that they resemble mortal women? For they are       not such.         Soc. Pray, of what nature are they?         Strep. I do not clearly know: at  any rate they resemble       spread-out fleeces, and not women, by Jupiter! Not a       bit; for these have noses.         Soc. Answer, then, whatever I ask you.         Strep. Then say quickly what you wish.         Soc. Have you ever, when you; looked up, seen a cloud       like to a centaur, or a panther, or a wolf, or a bull?         Strep. By Jupiter, have I! But what of that?         Soc. They become all things, whatever they please. And       then if they see a person with long hair, a wild one of       these hairy fellows, like the son of Xenophantes, in       derision of his folly, they liken themselves to       centaurs.         Strep. Why, what, if they should see Simon,  a plunderer       of the public property, what do they do?         Soc. They suddenly become wolves, showing up his       disposition.         Strep. For this reason, then, for this reason, when they       yesterday saw Cleonymus the recreant, on this account       they became stags, because they saw this most cowardly       fellow.         Soc. And now too, because they saw Clisthenes, you       observe, on this account they became women.         Strep. Hail therefore, O mistresses! And now, if ever ye       did to any other, to me also utter a voice reaching to       heaven, O all-powerful queens.         Cho. Hail, O ancient veteran, hunter after learned       speeches! And thou, O priest of most subtle trifles!       Tell us what you require? For we would not hearken to       any other of the recent meteorological sophists, except       to Prodicus;  to him, on account of his wisdom and       intelligence; and to you, because you walk proudly in       the streets, and cast your eyes askance, and endure many       hardships with bare feet, and in reliance upon us       lookest supercilious.         Strep. O Earth, what a voice! How holy and dignified and       wondrous!         Soc. For, in fact, these alone are goddesses; and all       the rest is nonsense.         Strep. But come, by the Earth, is not Jupiter, the       Olympian, a god?         Soc. What Jupiter? Do not trifle. There is no Jupiter.         Strep. What do you say? Who rains then? For first of all       explain this to me.         Soc. These to be sure. I will teach you it by powerful       evidence. Come, where have you ever seen him raining at       any time without Clouds? And yet he ought to rain in       fine weather, and these be absent.         Strep. By Apollo, of a truth you have rightly confirmed       this by your present argument. And yet, before this, I       really thought that Jupiter caused the rain. But tell me       who is it that thunders. This makes me tremble.         Soc. These, as they roll, thunder.         Strep. In what way? you all-daring man!         Soc. When they are full of much water, and are compelled       to be borne along, being necessarily precipitated when       full of rain, then they fall heavily upon each other and       burst and clap.         Strep. Who is it that compels them to borne along? Is it       not Jupiter?         Soc. By no means, but aethereal Vortex.         Strep. Vortex? It had escaped my notice that Jupiter did       not exist, and that Vortex now reigned in his stead. But       you have taught me nothing as yet concerning the clap       and the thunder.         Soc. Have you not heard me, that I said that the Clouds,       when full of moisture, dash against each other and clap       by reason of their density?         Strep. Come, how am I to believe this?         Soc. I'll teach you from your own case. Were you ever,       after being stuffed with broth at the Panathenaic       festival,  then disturbed in your belly, and did a       tumult suddenly rumble through it?         Strep. Yes, by Apollo! And immediately the little broth       plays the mischief with me, and is disturbed and rumbles       like thunder, and grumbles dreadfully: at first gently       pappax, pappax; and then it adds papa-pappax; and       finally, it thunders downright papapappax, as they do.         Soc. Consider, therefore, how you have trumpeted from a       little belly so small; and how is it not probable that       this air, being boundless, should thunder so loudly?         Strep. For this reason, therefore, the two names also       Trump and Thunder, are similar to each other. But teach       me this, whence comes the thunderbolt blazing with fire,       and burns us to ashes when it smites us, and singes       those who survive. For indeed Jupiter evidently hurls       this at the perjured.         Soc. Why, how then, you foolish person, and savouring of       the dark ages and antediluvian, if his manner is to       smite the perjured, does he not blast Simon, and       Cleonymus, and Theorus? And yet they are very perjured.       But he smites his own temple, and Sunium the promontory       of Athens, and the tall oaks. Wherefore, for indeed an       oak does not commit perjury.         Strep. I do not know; but you seem to speak well. For       what, pray, is the thunderbolt?         Soc. When a dry wind, having been raised aloft, is       inclosed in these Clouds, it inflates them within, like       a bladder; and then, of necessity, having burst them, it       rushes out with vehemence by reason of its density,       setting fire to itself through its rushing and       impetuosity.         Strep. By Jupiter, of a truth I once experienced this       exactly at the Diasian  festival! I was roasting a       haggis for my kinsfolk, and through neglect I did not       cut it open; but it became inflated and then suddenly       bursting, befouled my eyes and burned my face.         Cho. O mortal, who hast desired great wisdom from us!       How happy will you become among the Athenians and among       the Greeks, if you be possessed of a good memory, and be       a deep thinker, and endurance of labour be implanted in       your soul, and you be not wearied either by standing or       walking, nor be exceedingly vexed at shivering with       cold, nor long to break your fast, and you refrain from       wine, and gymnastics, and the other follies, and       consider this the highest excellence, as is proper a       clever man should, to conquer by action and counsel, and       by battling with your tongue.         Strep. As far as regards a sturdy spirit, and care that       makes one's bed uneasy, and a frugal spirit and       hard-living and savory-eating belly, be of good courage       and don't trouble yourself; I would offer myself to       hammer on, for that matter.         Soc. Will you not, pray, now believe in no god, except       what we believe in--this Chaos, and the Clouds, and the       Tongue--these three?         Strep. Absolutely I would not even converse with the       others, not even if I met them; nor would I sacrifice to       them, nor make libations,  nor offer frankincense.         Cho. Tell us then boldly, what we must do for you? For       you shall not fail in getting it, if you honour and       admire us, and seek to become clever.         Strep. O mistresses, I request of you then this very       small favour, that I be the best of the Greeks in       speaking by a hundred stadia.         Cho. Well, you shall have this from us, so that       hence-forward from this time no one shall get more       opinions passed in the public assemblies than you.         Strep. Grant me not to deliver important opinions; for I     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#3)"],[1,"daylight.\" So he loved her for a whole day.  What should one eat in order to be loved by royalty? Was it necessary to  have a coat of arms? She had them in number, because she had been loved  by all the great names in the book of heraldry. And so she begged the  Viscount Jean du Barry to give her the title of viscountess. \"Better  still,\" exclaimed Jean, \"I will give you the title of countess. My  brother will marry you; he is a male scamp, and you are the female. What  a beautiful marriage!\"    So they were united. The newly made countess was solemnly presented at  court by a countess of an ancient date, namely, the Countess de Bearn.  King Voltaire protested, in a satire entitled \"_The Court of King  Petaud_\" (topsy-turvy), afterwards denying it. The duc de Choiseul  protested, France protested, but all Versailles threw itself  passionately at the feet of the new countess. Even the daughters of the  King paid her court, and allowed her to call them by their pet  names: Loque, Chiffe, and Graille. The King, jealous of this gracious  familiarity, wished her to call him by some pet name, and so the  Bacchante, who believed that through the King she held all France in her  hand, called him \"La France,\" making him a wife to his Gray Musketeers.    Oh, that happy time! Du Barry and Louis XV hid their life--like the  sage--in their little apartments. She honeyed his chocolate, and  he himself made her coffee. Royalty consecrated a new verb for the  dictionary of the Academy, and Madame du Barry said to the King: \"At  home, I can love you to madness.\" The King gave the castle of Lucienne  to his mistress in order to be able to sing the same song. Truly the  Romeo and Juliet _de la main gauche_.    Du Barry threw out her fish-wifely epithets with ineffable tenderness.  She only opened her eyes half way, even when she took him by the throat.  The King was enchanted by these humors. It was a new world. But someone  said to him: \"Ah, Sire, it is easy to see that your Majesty has never  been at the house of Gourdan.\"    Yet Du Barry was adored by poets and artists. She extended both hands to  them. Jeanne's beauty had a penetrating, singular charm. At once she  was blonde and brunette--black eyebrows and lashes with blue eyes,  rebellious light hair with darker shadows, cheeks of ideal contour,  whose pale rose tints were often heightened by two or three touches--a  lie \"formed by the hand of Love,\" as anthology puts it--a nose with  expressive nostrils, an air of childlike candour, and a look seductive  to intoxication. A bold yet shrinking Venus, a Hebe yet a Bacchante.  With much grace Voltaire says:    \"Madame:    \"M. de la Borde tells me that you have ordered him to kiss me on both  cheeks for you:         \"What!  Two kisses at life's end       What a passport to send me!       Two is one too much, Adorable Nymph;       I should die of pleasure at the first.    \"He showed me your portrait, and be not offended, Madame, when I tell  you that I have taken the liberty of giving that the two kisses.\"    Perhaps Voltaire would not have written this letter, had he not read the  one written by the King to the Duc de Choiseul, who refused to pay court  to the left-hand queen:    \"My Cousin,    \"The discontent which your acts cause me forces me to exile you to  Chanteloup, where you will take yourself within twenty-four hours. I  would have sent you farther away were it not for the particular esteem  in which I hold Madame de Choiseul. With this, I pray God, my cousin, to  take you into His safe and holy protection.    \"Louis.\"    This exile was the only crime of the courtesan. On none of her enemies  did she close the gates of the Bastille. And more than once did she  place a pen in the hands of Louis XV with which to sign a pardon.  Sometimes, indeed, she was ironic in her compassion.    \"Madame,\" said M. de Sartines to her one day, \"I have discovered a rogue  who is scattering songs about you; what is to be done with him?\"    \"Sentence him to sing them for a livelihood.\"    But she afterwards made the mistake of pensioning Chevalier de Morande  to buy silence.    The pleasures of the King and his favorite were troubled only by the  fortune-tellers. Neither the King nor the countess believed in the  predictions of the philosophers, but they did believe in divination. One  day, returning from Choisy, Louis XV found under a cushion of his coach  a slip of paper on which was transcribed this prediction of the monk  Aimonius, the savant who could read all things from the vast book of the  stars:    \"As soon as Childeric had returned from Thuringia, he was crowned King  of France And no sooner was he King than he espoused Basine, wife of the  King of Thuringia. She came herself to find Childeric. The first night  of the marriage, and before the King had retired, the queen begged  Childeric to look from one of the palace windows which opened on a park,  and tell what he saw there. Childeric looked out and, much terrified,  reported to the princess that he had seen tigers and lions. Basine sent  him a second time to look out. This time the prince only saw bears and  wolves, and the third time he perceived only cats and dogs, fighting  and combating each other. Then Basine said to him: I will give you  an explanation of what you have seen: The first figure shows you  your successors, who will excel you in courage and power; the second  represents another race which will be illustrious for their conquests,  and which will augment your kingdom for many centuries; but the third  denotes the end of your kingdom, which will be given over to pleasures  and will lose to you the friendship of your subjects; and this because  the little animals signify a people who, emancipated from fear of  princes, will massacre them and make war upon each other.\"    Louis read the prediction and passed the paper to the Countess: \"After  us the end of the world,\" said she gaily. The King laughed, but the abbe  de Beauvais celebrated high mass at Versailles after the carnival of  1774, and dared to say, in righteous anger: \"This carnival is the last;  yet forty days and Nineveh shall perish.\" Louis turned pale. \"Is it God  who speaks thus?\" murmured he, raising his eyes to the altar. The next  day he went to the hunt in grand style, but from that evening he was  afraid of solitude and silence: \"It is like the tomb; I do not wish  to put myself in such a place,\" said he to Madame du Barry. The duc  de Richelieu tried to divert him. \"No,\" said he suddenly, as if the  Trappist's denunciation had again recurred to him, \"I shall be at ease  only when these forty days have passed.\" He died on the fortieth day.    Du Barry believed neither in God nor in the devil, but she believed in  the almanac of Liege. She scarcely read any book but this--faithful to  her earliest habits. And the almanac of Liege, in its prediction for  April, 1774, said: \"A woman, the greatest of favorites, will play her  last role.\" So Madame the Countess du Barry said without ceasing:  \"I shall not be tranquil until these forty days have passed.\" The  thirty-seventh day the King went to the hunt attended with all the  respect due to his rank. Jeanne wept in silence and prayed to God as one  who has long neglected her prayers.    Louis XV had not neglected his prayers, and gave two hundred thousand  livres to the poor, besides ordering masses at St. Genevieve. Parliament  opened the shrine, and knelt gravely before that miraculous relic. The  least serious of all these good worshippers was, strange to say, the  curate of St. Genevieve: \"Ah, well!\" said he gaily, when Louis was dead,  \"let us continue to talk of the miracles of St. Genevieve. Of what can  you complain? Is not the King dead?\"    At the last moment it was not God who held the heart of Louis--it was  his mistress. \"Ask the Countess to come here again,\" he said.    \"Sire, you know that she has gone away,\" they answered.    \"Ah! has she gone? Then I must go!\" So he departed.    His end drew forth some maledictions. There were insults even at his  funeral services. \"Nevertheless,\" said one old soldier, \"he was at the  battle of Fontenoy.\" That was the most eloquent funeral oration of Louis  XV.    \"The King is dead, long live the King!\" But before the death of Louis  XVI they cried: \"The king is dead, long live the Republic!\"    Rose-colored mourning was worn in the good city of Paris. The funeral  oration of the King and a lament for his mistress were pronounced by  Sophie Arnould, of which masterpiece of sacred eloquence the last words  only are preserved: \"Behold us orphaned both of father and mother.\"    If Madame du Barry was one of the seven plagues of royalty, she died  faithful to royalty. After her exile to Pont aux Dames she returned to  Lucienne, where the duc de Cosse Brissac consoled her for the death of  Louis XV. But what she loved in Louis was that he was a king; her true  country was Versailles; her true light was the sun of court life. Like  Montespan, also a courtesan of high order, she often went in these dark  days to cast a loving look upon the solitary park in the maze of the  Trianon. Yet she was particularly happy at Lucienne.    I have compared her to Manon Lescaut, and I believe her to have been  also a sister to Ganesin. All three were destroyed by passion.    One day she found herself still young at Lucienne, although her sun was  setting. She loved the duc de Brissac, and how many pages of her past  romance would she that day have liked to erase and forget!    \"Why do you weep, Countess?\" asked her lover.    \"My friend,\" she responded, \"I weep because I love you, shall I say it?  I weep because I am happy.\"    She was right; happiness is a festival that should know no to-morrow.  But on the morrow of her happiness, the Revolution knocked at the castle  gate of Lucienne.    \"Who goes there?\"    \"I am justice; prepare for destiny.\"    The Queen, the true queen, had been good to her as to everybody."]]]
