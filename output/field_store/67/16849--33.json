That youth are _unwilling to be advised_, as a general rule, appears  to me untrue. At least I have not found it so. When the feeling does  exist, I believe it often arises from parental mismanagement, or from  an unfortunate method of advising.    The infant seeks to grasp the burning lamp;--the parent endeavors  to dissuade him from it. At length he grasps it, and suffers the  consequences. Finally, however, if the parent manages him properly,  he learns to follow his advice, and obey his indications, in order  to avoid pain. Such, at least, is the natural result of _rational_  management. And the habit of seeking parental counsel, once formed, is  not easily eradicated. It is true that temptation and forgetfulness may  lead some of the young _occasionally_ to grasp the _lamp_, even after  they are told better; but the consequent suffering generally restores  them to their reason. It is only when the parent neglects or refuses to  give advice, and for a long time manifests little or no sympathy with  his child, that the habit of filial reliance and confidence is destroyed.  In fact there are very few children indeed, however improperly managed,  who do not in early life acquire a degree of this confiding, inquiring,  counsel-seeking disposition.    Most persons, as they grow old, forget that they have ever been young  themselves. This greatly disqualifies them for social enjoyment. It was  wisely said; 'He who would pass the latter part of his life with honor  and decency, must, when he is young, consider that he shall one day be  old, and when he is old, remember that he has once been young.' But if  forgetfulness on this point disqualifies a person for _self_ enjoyment,  how much more for that which is social?    Still more does it disqualify us for giving advice. While a lad, I was  at play, one day, with my mates, when two gentlemen observing us, one  of them said to the other; 'Do you think you ever acted as foolishly as  those boys do?' 'Why yes; I suppose I did;' was the reply. 'Well,' said  the other, 'I never did;--I _know_ I never did.'    Both of these persons has the name of parent, but he who could not  believe he had ever acted like a child himself, is greatly destitute of  the proper parental spirit. He never--or scarcely ever--puts himself to  the slightest inconvenience to promote, directly, the happiness of the  young, even for half an hour.    He supposes every child ought to be grave, like himself. If he sees the  young engaged in any of those exercises which are really adapted to  their years, he regards it as an entire loss of time, besides being  foolish and unreasonable. He would have them at work, or at their  studies. Whereas there is scarcely any thing that should give a parent  more pleasure than to see his children, in their earliest years,  enjoying that flow of spirits, which leads them forth to active,  vigorous, blood-stirring sports.    Of all persons living, he who does not remember that he has once been  young, is the most completely disqualified for giving youthful counsel.  He obtrudes his advice occasionally, when the youth is already under  temptation, and borne along with the force of a vicious current; but  because he disregards it, he gives him up as heedless, perhaps as  obstinate. If advice is afterwards asked, his manners are cold and  repulsive. Or perhaps he frowns him away, telling him he never _follows_  his advice, and therefore it is useless to _give_ it. So common is it  to treat the young with a measure of this species of roughness, that I  cannot wonder the maxim has obtained that the young, generally, 'despise  counsel.' And yet, I am fully convinced, no maxim is farther from the  truth.    When we come to the very close of life, we cannot transfer, in a single  moment, that knowledge of the world and of human nature which an  experience of 70 years has afforded us. If, therefore, from any cause  whatever, we have not already dealt it out to those around us, it is  likely to be lost;--and lost for ever. Now is it not a pity that what  the young would regard as an invaluable treasure, could they come at it  in such a manner, and at such seasons, as would be _agreeable_ to them,  and that, too, which the old are naturally so fond of distributing,  should be buried with their bodies?    Let me counsel the young, then, to do every thing they can, consistently  with the rules of good breeding, to draw forth from the old the  treasures of which I have been speaking. Let them even make some  sacrifice of that buoyant feeling which, at their age, is so apt to  predominate. Let them conform, for the time, in some measure, to the  gravity of the aged, in order to gain their favor, and secure their  friendship and confidence. I do not ask them wholly to forsake society,  or their youthful pastimes for this purpose, or to become grave  _habitually_; for this would be requiring too much. But there are  moments when old people, however disgusted they may be with the young,  do so far unbend themselves as to enter into cheerful and instructive  conversation. I can truly say that when a boy, some of my happiest  hours were spent in the society of the aged--those too, who were not  always what they should have been. The old live in the past, as truly  as the young do in the future. Nothing more delights them than to  relate stories of 'olden time,' especially when themselves were the  _heroes_. But they will not relate them, unless there is somebody to  hear. Let the young avail themselves of this propensity, and make the  most of it. Some may have been heroes in war; some in travelling the  country; others in hunting, fishing, agriculture or the mechanic arts;  and it may be that here and there one will boast of his skill, and  relate stories of his success in that noblest of arts and  employments--the making of his fellow creatures wise, and good, and  happy.    In conversation with all these persons, you will doubtless hear much  that is uninteresting. But where will you find any thing pure or  perfect below the sun? The richest ores contain dross. At the same time  you cannot fail, unless the fault is your own, to learn many valuable  things from them all. From war stories, you will learn history; from  accounts of travels, geography, human character, manners and customs;  and from stories of the good or ill treatment which may have been  experienced, you will learn how to secure the one, and avoid the other.  From one person you will learn _one_ thing; from another something  else. Put these shreds together, and in time you will form quite a  number of pages in the great book of human nature. You may thus, in a  certain sense, live several lives in one.    One thing more is to be remembered. The more you _have_, the more you  are bound to _give_. Common sense, as well as the Scripture, says, 'It  is more blessed to give than to receive.' Remember that as you advance  in years you are bound to avoid falling into the very errors which,  'out of your own mouth' you have 'condemned' in those who have gone  before you; and to make yourselves as acceptable as you can to the  young, in order to secure their confidence, and impart to them, little  by little, those accumulated treasures of experience which you have  acquired in going through life, but which must otherwise, to a very  great extent, be buried with you in your graves.    But, my young friends, there is one method besides conversation, in  which you may come at the wisdom of the aged; and that is through the  medium of books. _Many_ old persons have _written_ well, and you cannot  do better than to avail yourselves of their instructions. This method  has even one advantage over conversation. In the perusal of a book, you  are not so often prejudiced or disgusted by the repulsive and perhaps  chilling manner of him who wrote it, as you might have been from his  conversation and company.    I cannot but indulge the hope that you will find some valuable  information and useful advice in _this_ little book. It has cost me  much labor to embody, in so small a compass, the results of my own  experience on such a variety of subjects, and to arrange my thoughts in  such a manner as seemed to me most likely to arrest and secure your  attention. The work, however, is not wholly the result of my own  experience, for I have derived many valuable thoughts from other  writers.    An introductory chapter or preface is usually rather dry, but if this  should prove sufficiently interesting to deserve your attention till  you have read it, and the table of contents, thoroughly, I have strong  hopes that you will read the rest of the book. And in accordance with  my own principles, I believe you will try to follow my advice; for I  take it for granted that none will purchase and read this work but such  as are willing to be advised. I repeat it, therefore--I go upon the  presumption that my advice will, in the main, be followed. Not at every  moment of your lives, it is true; for you will be exposed on all sides  to temptation, and, I fear, sometimes fall. But when you come to review  the chapter (for I hope I have written nothing but what is worth a  second reading) which contains directions on that particular subject  wherein you have failed, and find, too, how much you have suffered by  neglecting counsel, and rashly seizing the _lamp_, I am persuaded you  will not soon fall again in that particular direction.    In this view, I submit these pages to the youth of our American States.  If the work should not please them, I shall be so far from attributing  it to any fault or perversity of theirs, that I shall at once conclude  I have not taken a wise and proper method of presenting my  instructions.

It was a cruel thing; she was fast wedged in the crowd. Someone  ran after the man and told him where she was, but before the sympathiser  could reach him his company had been drawn up and he could not be  allowed to fall out. And long before she was clear of the tightly packed  throng he had passed on to the ship, where she could not follow him.    Another incident of another kind. The North Lancashires were marching  in, and an old man in the crowd was on the look-out for his son. He  explained to everybody near him what a fine boy his son was, and how  keen a soldier; how it had nearly broken the old man's heart that his  boy should leave him and go to the war, but how it would \"do un good and  make a mon of un.\" Presently two soldiers appeared, half-carrying and  half-dragging between them a young man who was so drunk that he could  neither stand nor walk. His helmet was jammed over his eyes, but as he  was dragged past us it fell off and rolled to the old man's feet. I  heard him draw in his breath sharply and murmur something as his face  flushed; and then all the people round began to point and say, \"That's  his son there, him that's being carried\"; and some--God forgive  them!--laughed and joked at the old man. And he who had a moment ago  filled our ears with the praises of his boy gazed after him with a look  of bitter amazement and then went silently away. Another man who had  missed seeing his wife before he had embarked caught sight of her from  the ship's deck as she stood upon the quay with tears in her eyes. There  was no chance of his being allowed to pass down the gangway. But the  husband in him knew no obedience to the stern order, and he dived clean  off the stern of the steamer into the filthy water and swam, khaki and  all, to the steps at the side of the dock. And you may be sure his wife  was there to help him out, and she forgot her grief in her pride at his  daring. So he held her in his arm for a moment (and had three ringing  cheers from his mates into the bargain) before he was collared and  marched back to restraint, dirty but glorious.    Here and there one saw men much the worse for liquor; and I have no  words to describe the folly of those friends who thrust bottles of  spirits into the soldiers' hands as they passed through the streets.  They did them a double cruelty, for the poor fellows, all unstrung by  their partings, gulped the raw spirit thinking they drank courage; and  so once or twice I saw poor women saying good-bye to staggering  maniacs--grim mockeries of the husbands they might never see again, the  poor fools themselves at present oblivious indeed, but doomed to I know  not what horrors of remorse on awaking. Happily, however, there were not  many in this sad condition. Most of the men behaved with a fortitude and  gentleness that was most touching. Indeed I find it hard to express my  admiration of their bearing. There was none of the bluster of the  armchair Jingo, none of the loud hectoring and swaggering and bravado  that distinguish the carpet warrior. On the contrary, when they were  talking of the war amongst themselves they had an air of quiet  determination, of good-humoured banter, and of easy, serious confidence  far more ominous for an enemy than any amount of fluent rant. After the  world of politics, with its hair-splitting and word-mincing, it was good  to be with soldiers--the men who do the work. They knew no fine  political shades, they bandied no epithets; England was at war and they  were going to fight--that was enough. And the spirit in which they  fought all the world knows: every day during the war one read tales of  devotion and heroism that became almost commonplace; it is even a  commonplace to praise them. Yet one could not see the soldiers in this  most trying duty of all, the laying down of home ties and interests (for  I think the heroism of mere fighting is nothing to it), without feeling  a pride in the moral discipline that makes it all possible, and under  the authority of which Tommy is content to be as a child. And this  childlike submission to discipline has its pathetic side, as when one  saw the little family of mother and children grouped to see the last of  its head. The children stood in wide-eyed amazement to see daddy the  Reservist, who in the little household had been the emblem of all  authority, now in the place of obedience, and taking directions from  another man (not so big and strong as he) as to how he should stand and  into what hole he should put the buckle of his strap. Thus even the  father and the husband are absorbed in the soldier. It is a great price;  and the way in which it was paid by so many was perhaps our firmest  assurance of the stuff that is in our soldiers.    Early on the morning of departure a few hundred people--mostly  women--stood on the pierhead of Canada Dock, watching the transport as  she lay a short distance off in the stream with the Blue Peter at her  fore and the St. George's ensign hanging astern. The rain beat steadily  down, loading the raw wind that blew out of the morning twilight, and  the brown water broke sullenly to the send of a setting flood tide. The  faces of nearly all the women were worn with weeping; now they wept no  longer, but looked dully out to sea, while the rain ran down their  soaking garments and splashed on the ground. A drunken soldier who had  somehow got ashore the night before reeled helplessly on his wife's arm,  his head bruised and cut and his new uniform torn and filthy. But in the  woman's face there was a kind of fearful joy; she had rescued him from  his pot-house satellites, and she thought she could keep him. Presently  a tug came off from the transport with a picket to collect deserters--he  had to go. She sobbed and wailed, imploring the sergeant in vain; and  she clung to her poor senseless husband as though she would never leave  him. He hardly knew her; he laughed vacantly in her face when with  streaming eyes she begged him to speak her name; then they took him away  from her. As the tug steamed out I heard him singing.    A little while afterwards the _Canada's_ siren began to wail and squeal  with a horrible mockery of painful cries. The tugs backed clear of her,  and lent their shrill voices to the discordant concert. Presently the  water astern of the transport turned from brown to foaming white, and  her masts began to move past the farther shore. There was a faint sound  of cheering from her, but she was soon out of sound and sight, and still  the women stared into the mist that had enfolded her, as though their  wishes might draw her back again. But in a little while they turned  towards home and a world that had changed its face.           *       *       *       *       *    On another day I went down to Liverpool to see the _Majestic_ depart  with troops for the front. The weather was consistently unkind. The  _Canada_ had sailed in a whirl of rainy fog, and the departing  passengers of the _Majestic_ looked across a little inky strip of water  to a land that was cloaked with snow. It was bitterly cold on the  landing-stage, and all the interest of the scene could not keep the  bitter wind from whipping one's face and numbing the feet. The wooden  planks resounded not more with the tramp of marching feet than with the  hard stampings of people who were trying to restore circulation. There  were no very poor people on the stage. The space opposite to the ship  was occupied chiefly by the friends of officers and by the troops  themselves, and certainly it seemed kinder to the men to prevent the  dreadful scrambling for farewells that took place when the _Canada_  sailed. But a sea of anxious faces pressed against the barriers at  either end of the reserved space, and no doubt there was much bitter  envy of us in the enclosure, who had so much better an opportunity, and  perhaps so much less reasonable a claim to the front places.    Outwardly this departure seemed very different from that of the  _Canada_. It was not so sordid, if one may use the term; the vessel did  not slip away furtively from a dock in the small hours of the morning,  but departed in open day from the more accessible landing-stage; and  although the weather was chill and bitter, it had not that infinitely  dreary effect upon the spirits that one associates with a soaking  downpour. Here were all the pomps and circumstances of farewell--the  blowing of bands and wavings of caps and great shouts of a multitude  that must give vent to acute emotions. Yet, different though the  outward circumstances were, they only accentuated the likeness that lay  beneath. Good-bye is good-bye, whether we say it at a carriage window or  shout it across a strip of harbour water; whether a crowd sings \"Auld  Lang Syne\" or a mother whispers \"Don't forget me.\" And at the sailing of  the _Majestic_, with all its dignity, one saw the same tragedies  repeated over and over again, until one's heart sickened of it all, and  one would gladly have come away. Of course it was not among the officers  and their wives that one saw these things; people used to self-control  keep their griefs to themselves, and perhaps a very inexperienced person  would have been deceived by the smiles on women's faces and the cheery  chaff of men. Even here there were things to be seen at the last moment,  but I confess that I turned my back when the saloon gangway was about to  be removed; some things are sacred even from the man whose business it  is to describe what he sees.    It was after the two thousand troops had all been embarked that the  friends of the men were admitted to the stage, and the dismal, though  enthusiastic, part of the affair began. Before that everything was  business and order. As the men arrived they were provided with hot  coffee and meat pies, which they drank and ate with every sign of"]]]
