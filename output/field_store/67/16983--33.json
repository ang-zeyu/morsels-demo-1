Then Tinville and Merlin both cursed loudly and volubly, and bidding  their men follow them, turned away from the house in the Rue de  l'Ancienne Comedie and left its toothless landlady on her own doorstep  still volubly protesting her patriotism and her desire to serve the  government of the Republic.    Tinville and Merlin, however, took the scrap of paper to Citizen  Robespierre, who smiled grimly as he in his turn crushed the offensive  little document in the palm of his well-washed hands.    Robespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or oaths, but he  slipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his silver snuff box  and then he sent a special messenger to Citizen Chauvelin in the Rue  Corneille, bidding him come that same evening after ten o'clock to room  No. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the Tuileries.    It was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat opposite one  another in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette, and between them on  the table, just below the tallow-candle, was a much creased, exceedingly  grimy bit of paper.    It had passed through several unclean hands before Citizen Robespierre's  immaculately white fingers had smoothed it out and placed it before the  eyes of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.    The latter, however, was not looking at the paper, he was not even  looking at the pale, cruel face before him. He had closed his eyes and  for a moment had lost sight of the small dark room, of Robespierre's  ruthless gaze, of the mud-stained walls and greasy floor. He was seeing,  as in a bright and sudden vision, the brilliantly-lighted salons of the  Foreign Office in London, with beautiful Marguerite Blakeney gliding  queenlike on the arm of the Prince of Wales.    He heard the flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, and  above all the din and sound of dance music, he heard an inane laugh and  an affected voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that was even now written  on that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him:         \"We seek him here, and we seek him there,        Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!        Is he in heaven, is he in hell,        That demmed elusive Pimpernel?\"    It was a mere flash! One of memory's swiftly effaced pictures, when she  shows us for the fraction of a second, indelible pictures from out our  past. Chauvelin, in that same second, while his own eyes were closed  and Robespierre's fixed upon him, also saw the lonely cliffs of Calais,  heard the same voice singing: \"God save the King!\" the volley of  musketry, the despairing cries of Marguerite Blakeney; and once again he  felt the keen and bitter pang of complete humiliation and defeat.          Chapter III: Ex-Ambassador Chauvelin        Robespierre had quietly waited the while. He was in no hurry: being a  night-bird of very pronounced tastes, he was quite ready to sit here  until the small hours of the morning watching Citizen Chauvelin mentally  writhing in the throes of recollections of the past few months.    There was nothing that delighted the sea-green Incorruptible quite so  much as the aspect of a man struggling with a hopeless situation and  feeling a net of intrigue drawing gradually tighter and tighter around  him.    Even now, when he saw Chauvelin's smooth forehead wrinkled into an  anxious frown, and his thin hand nervously clutched upon the table,  Robespierre heaved a pleasurable sigh, leaned back in his chair, and  said with an amiable smile:    \"You do agree with me, then, Citizen, that the situation has become  intolerable?\"    Then as Chauvelin did not reply, he continued, speaking more sharply:    \"And how terribly galling it all is, when we could have had that man  under the guillotine by now, if you had not blundered so terribly last  year.\"    His voice had become hard and trenchant like that knife to which he was  so ready to make constant allusion. But Chauvelin still remained silent.  There was really nothing that he could say.    \"Citizen Chauvelin, how you must hate that man!\" exclaimed Robespierre  at last.    Then only did Chauvelin break the silence which up to now he had  appeared to have forced himself to keep.    \"I do!\" he said with unmistakable fervour.    \"Then why do you not make an effort to retrieve the blunders of last  year?\" queried Robespierre blandly. \"The Republic has been unusually  patient and long-suffering with you, Citizen Chauvelin. She has taken  your many services and well-known patriotism into consideration. But  you know,\" he added significantly, \"that she has no use for worthless  tools.\"    Then as Chauvelin seemed to have relapsed into sullen silence, he  continued with his original ill-omened blandness:    \"Ma foi! Citizen Chauvelin, were I standing in your buckled shoes, I  would not lose another hour in trying to avenge mine own humiliation!\"    \"Have I ever had a chance?\" burst out Chauvelin with ill-suppressed  vehemence. \"What can I do single-handed? Since war has been declared  I cannot go to England unless the Government will find some official  reason for my doing so. There is much grumbling and wrath over here, and  when that damned Scarlet Pimpernel League has been at work, when a score  or so of valuable prizes have been snatched from under the very knife  of the guillotine, then, there is much gnashing of teeth and useless  cursings, but nothing serious or definite is done to smother those  accursed English flies which come buzzing about our ears.\"    \"Nay! you forget, Citizen Chauvelin,\" retorted Robespierre, \"that we of  the Committee of Public Safety are far more helpless than you. You  know the language of these people, we don't. You know their manners and  customs, their ways of thought, the methods they are likely to employ:  we know none of these things. You have seen and spoken to men in England  who are members of that damned League. You have seen the man who is its  leader. We have not.\"    He leant forward on the table and looked more searchingly at the thin,  pallid face before him.    \"If you named that leader to me now, if you described him, we could  go to work more easily. You could name him, and you would, Citizen  Chauvelin.\"    \"I cannot,\" retorted Chauvelin doggedly.    \"Ah! but I think you could. But there! I do not blame your silence. You  would wish to reap the reward of your own victory, to be the instrument  of your own revenge. Passions! I think it natural! But in the name of  your own safety, Citizen, do not be too greedy with your secret. If the  man is known to you, find him again, find him, lure him to France! We  want him--the people want him! And if the people do not get what they  want, they will turn on those who have withheld their prey.\"    \"I understand, Citizen, that your own safety and that of your government  is involved in this renewed attempt to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel,\"  retorted Chauvelin drily.    \"And your head, Citizen Chauvelin,\" concluded Robespierre.    \"Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, and you will,  Citizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The question is,  if I am to lure that man to France what will you and your government do  to help me?\"    \"Everything,\" replied Robespierre, \"provided you have a definite plan  and a definite purpose.    \"I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a semi-official  capacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in disguise in out-of-the-way  corners.\"    \"That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British  authorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects  settled in England. After a good deal of correspondence they have  suggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look  after the interests of our own people commercially and financially.  We can easily send you over in that capacity if it would suit your  purpose.\"    \"Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as well as  another.\"    \"Is that all?\"    \"Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know that I  am fully trusted. Above all, I must have power--decisive, absolute,  illimitable power.\"    There was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad man, who  looked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the face and brought a  firm fist resolutely down upon the table before him. Robespierre paused  a while ere he replied; he was eying the other man keenly, trying to  read if behind that earnest, frowning brow there did not lurk some  selfish, ulterior motive along with that demand for absolute power.    But Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make every  cheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that slight moment  of hesitation Robespierre said quietly:    \"You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in every town  or borough of France which you may visit. The Revolutionary Government  shall create you, before you start for England, Supreme Head of all the  Sub-Committees of Public Safety. This will mean that in the name of the  safety of the Republic every order given by you, of whatsoever nature  it might be, must be obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for  treason.\"    Chauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction, which he  did not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.    \"I shall want agents,\" he said, \"or shall we say spies? and, of course,  money.\"    \"You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in  England and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much  dissatisfaction in their Midland counties--you remember the Birmingham  riots? They were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then you know  Candeille, the actress? She had found her way among some of those  circles in London who have what they call liberal tendencies.

H., have excited the  fears of the inhabitants, and we think should, ere this, have  attracted the attention of the scientific. These are reports of  explosions in the ground, apparently of a volcanic or gaseous nature.  When first heard they were attributed to the blasting of rocks in  Manchester, a new town some ten miles distant; but from the frequency  of the reports at all hours in the night as well as the day, from the  consideration that they were so loud, and were heard in all seasons,  winter as well as summer, it was soon concluded that they had some  other origin. The explosions, if they may be so called, commenced on a  ridge of land running S. E. and N, W, some five miles in length, and  principally on that portion called the South Road. They have, however,  extended, and arc now heard in a northerly direction. The sounds have  become louder, and during the last fall and the present spring or  summer, as many as twenty have been heard in one night. Many of them  jar the houses and ground perceptibly, so much so, that a child whose  balance is not steady, will roll from one side to the other. They are  as loud as a heavy cannon fired near the house, with no reverberation,  and little roll. Last fall some of the inhabitants were riding in a  wagon when an explosion was heard, and they saw the stone wall, which  was apparently quite compact, fall over on one side of the way, and a  second after upon the other. The stone wall of an unfinished cellar  also fell in. This can be attested by many witnesses. There is no  regularity in these reports, as they are heard at intervals of a day,  a week, and sometimes of months: but for the last year they have  become very common, and are heard almost every week more or less.\"           *       *       *       *       *          EXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF GAMBLING.      It is well known upon the western waters, that the firemen and other  hands employed upon the boats spend much of their idle time in playing  cards. Of the passion for gaming, thus excited, an instance has been  narrated to us upon the most credible authority, which surpasses the  highest wrought fictions of the gambler's fate. A colored fireman, on  board a steamboat running between Saint Louis and New-Orleans, had  lost all his money at poker with his companions. He then staked his  clothing, and being still unfortunate, pledged his own freedom for a  small amount. Losing this, the bets were doubled, and he finally at  one desperate hazard, ventured his full value as a slave, and laid  down his free papers to represent the stake. He lost, suffered his  certificates to be destroyed, and was actually sold by the winner to a  slave dealer, who hesitated not to take him at a small discount upon  his assessed value. When last heard of by one who knows him, and  informed us of the fact, he was still paying in servitude the penalty  of his criminal folly.           *       *       *       *       *          GEN. TAYLOR'S PATRIOTISM.      In answer to the complimentary resolutions passed at a meeting in this  city some weeks since, Gen. Taylor says, \"It is a source of  gratulation to me that the meeting refrained from the meditated  nomination for the presidency. For the high office in question I have  no aspirations. The government has assigned to me an arduous and  responsible duty in the prosecution of the existing war: in conducting  it with honor to the country lie all my real aspirations.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE COLUMBIAN MAGAZINE.      The October number of this splendid work will be found to be equal, if  not superior, to anything and everything of the kind in the literary  region. It presents three superb embellishments--\"A Cure for Love,\"  mezzotint, by Sadd; \"View on the St. Lawrence,\" fine steel engraving,  by C. F, Giles, and a plate of fashions; in a new style, besides a  piece of first rate music. This work is published monthly by Isreal  Post, 140 Nassau st. Terms, only $3 per annum.           *       *       *       *       *          A MOUNTAIN IN LABOR.      The workmen, says a Paris paper, are still busily engaged in  excavating Montmartre in quest of holy vases and other riches said to  have been deposited there in early days of the French revolution by  the orders of Lady Superior of the Abbey of Montmartre. Two workmen,  who were at the time charged with transporting the wealth to the place  designated were never seen, and it is supposed that they were  sacrificed to the necessity of the secret. The Superior, at her death,  bequeathed the secret to a lady friend, who in turn, on her death bed,  divulged it to her daughter, then 13 years of age. The child, now a  sexagenary, disclosed it to the municipiality. Her statements have  thus far been found scrupulously correct. The _cesarian_ operation is  actively going on, an excavation of fifty feet having been made, and  the mountain's speedy deliverance of a mine of wealth is anticipated.  May it not prove a mouse!           *       *       *       *       *          THE POPE'S WILL.      The late Pope has left a fortune of eleven millions of francs, which,  after some religious bequests; is to be divided among his relations!  upon the singular condition that they never contest the will, and that  they never take up their residence in Rome.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED RAILROAD.      The Harlem Railroad Company have laid down a section of their road  with cast iron rails of a new construction, invented by Mr. Imley.  These rails are highly approved, and are expected to supersede the  common wrought rails to a considerable extent.           *       *       *       *       *      It is reported that Mr. Isaac Fisk of Massachusetts, spells his name  \"Eyzurk Physque.\" Well, what if he does?           *       *       *       *       *          SAGEISMS.      He who is passionate and hasty is generally honest. It's your cool,  dissembling, smiling hypocrite, of whom you should beware. There is no  deceit about a bull dog. It's only the cur that sneaks up and bites  you when your back's turned. Again, we say, beware of a man who has  psalmody in his looks.    If a person is bent on quarrelling with you, leave the whole of it to  himself, and he will soon become weary of his unencouraged occupation.  Even the most malicious ram will soon cease to butt against a  disregarding object, and will usually find his own head more injured  than the object of his blind animosity. So let them kick.    An easy flow of words is no sign of an abundance of ideas. Swift made  a wise comparison when he likened a well stored mind to a crowded  church, where the people elbow each other, and cannot get out.    \"If a civil word or two will render a man happy,\" said a French king,  \"he must be a wretch indeed who will not give them to him. Such a  disposition is like lighting another man's candle by one's own, which  loses none of its brilliancy by what the other gains.\"           *       *       *       *       *          IN PREPARATION.      We have in course of preparation for future numbers, some large and  elegant engravings, illustrative of some of the most interest and  deeply scientific _new inventions_, together with illustrations of  architecture, geometry and magnetism. Also a variety of intelligence  in _arts and trades_.           *       *       *       *       *          A STRONG POSITION.      \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" said an eminent lawyer, \"there are four  points in this case. In the first place, we contend that we never had  the plaintiff's horse; second, that we paid him for the use of the  horse; third, he agreed to let us use the horse for his keeping,  without any charge; and fourth, that his horse is a jackass.\"           *       *       *       *       *          AS GOOD AS CASH.      An editor out west having asked the consent of a father to his  daughter's hand in marriage, the provident old gentleman inquired how  much money he could bring the bride. The editor said he hadn't got any  money, but he would give her a puff in his paper. The father was  satisfied.           *       *       *       *       *          HOW VERY HOT IT IS.      The following lines would have been inserted earlier, but the weather  was so hot we could not attend to it.      Did you ever know such weather?    Seven bright burning days together!    Swelt'ring nights and broiling days,    Sultry moonbeams, sun's hot rays:    No one knows which way to turn him,    All things either melt or burn him;    Half the weight of all the nation,    Is flying off in perspiration,    And every man, and woman too,    As languidly they look at you,    Exclaims, with moist and mournful phiz,      \"Dear me! how very hot it is!\"      Ladies all languid in muslin array,    Loll upon couches the live long day,    Looking more lovely than we can say--    Though, alas! they are rapidly melting away    \"Bring me _an ice!_\" they languidly cry,    But alas and alack! it is \"all in my eye\"--    For before it reaches the top of the stairs,    It's turned into water quite \"unawares,\"    While John with his salver, looks red and stares,    And the moist confectioner inwardly swears,    As he wipes with his apron his long, pale phiz,      \"Oh--pooh! how infernally hot it is!\"      Oh, what a treat 'twould be to wade    Chin deep in fresh ice and lemonade!    Or to sit a deep marble bowl within,    And camphor gurgling around your chin--    Hissing and sparkling round your nose,    Till you open your mouth and down it goes,    Gulp by gulp, and sup by sup,    As you \"catawumpishly chew it up.\"    Refreshing your heart and cooling your faces--    Burnt down as they've been with all sorts of sauces    Oh, the fellow"]]]
