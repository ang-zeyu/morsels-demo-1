Bordeaux[1] is not yet gone; I saw in a letter that it was  _debated_ in his presence whether he was on any favourable occasion  _de se presenter en France!_Do you think that possible? Then again  the papers say that there are fortifications being made on the coast  of Normandy for fear of an invasion; is this so? These are many  questions, but I hope you will kindly answer them, as they interest  me. With Albert's love. Believe me, ever, your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 1: The Duc de Bordeaux, only son of the Duc de      Berri, had by the death of Charles X. and the renunciation      of all claims to the French Throne on the part of the Duc      d'Angouleme, become the representative of the elder branch of      the Bourbons. He had intended his visit to England to have a      private character only.]          [Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGE]      _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._    CLAREMONT, _10th January 1844_.    The Queen understands that there is a negotiation with Sweden and  Denmark pending about the cessation of their tribute to Morocco,  likewise that Prince Metternich has sent a despatch condemning as  unfair the understanding come to between us and France about the  Spanish marriage;[2] that there is a notion of exchanging Hong Kong  for a more healthy colony.    The Queen, taking a deep interest in all these matters, and feeling it  her duty to do so, begs Lord Aberdeen to keep her always well informed  of what is on the _tapis_ in his Department.        [Footnote 2: _See ante_, vol. i. p. 487.]          _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._    CLAREMONT, _13th January 1844._    The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 10th, and returns  him the papers which he sent her, with her best thanks. She does not  remember to have seen them before.    The Queen takes this opportunity to beg Lord Aberdeen to cause the  despatches to be sent a little sooner from the Foreign Office,  as drafts in particular have often come to the Queen a week or a  fortnight after they had actually been sent across the sea.    With respect to the Hanoverian Orders, Lord Aberdeen has not quite  understood what the Queen meant. It was Sir C. Thornton and others  to whom the Queen had refused permission to accept the favour, on a  former occasion, by which the King of Hanover was much affronted. The  Queen would not like to have herself additionally fettered by any new  regulation, but Lord Aberdeen will certainly concur with the Queen  that it would not be expedient to give to the King of Hanover a power  which the Queen herself does not possess, viz. that of granting orders  as favours, or for personal services; as the number of the different  classes of the Guelphic Order bestowed on Englishmen is innumerable,  it would actually invest the King with such a power, which,  considering how much such things are sought after, might be extremely  inconvenient.    The Queen will not give a final decision upon this case until she  returns to Windsor, where she has papers explanatory of the reasons  which caused her to decline the King of Hanover's application in 1838.          [Pageheading: A CARRIAGE ACCIDENT]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    CLAREMONT, _16th January 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your kind letter of the 11th.  Louise can give you the details of the little upset I and Lady Douro  had, and which I did not think worth while to mention.[3] It was the  strangest thing possible to happen, and the most _unlikely_, for we  were going quite quietly, not at all in a narrow lane, with very quiet  ponies and my usual postillion; the fact was that the boy looked the  _wrong_ way, and therefore did not perceive the ditch which he so  cleverly got us into.    We leave dear Claremont, as usual, with the greatest regret; we are  so peaceable here; Windsor is beautiful and comfortable, but it is a  _palace_, and God knows _how willingly_ I would _always_ live with my  beloved Albert and our children in the quiet and retirement of private  life, and not be the constant object of observation, and of newspaper  articles. The children (Pussette and Bertie) have been most remarkably  well, and so have we, in spite of the very bad weather we had most  days. I am truly and really grieved that good excellent Nemours  is again _not_ to get his _dotation_.[4] Really we constitutional  countries are _too shabby_.    Now, dearest Uncle, I must bid you adieu, begging you to believe me,  ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 3: On the 5th of January the Queen's phaeton was      overturned at Horton, near Dachet, while driving to the meet      of Prince Albert's Harriers.]        [Footnote 4: On the occasion of the marriage of the Duc and      Duchesse de Nemours (1840), the proposal made by the Soult      Government for a Parliamentary grant of 500,000 francs had      been rejected.]          [Pageheading: FRANCE AND ENGLAND]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _30th January 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I must begin by thanking you for your kind letter  of the 26th, and by wishing you joy that the fete went off _so_ well.  I am glad Leo will appear at the next ball; he is nearly nine years  old, and it is good to accustom children of his rank early to these  things.    Guizot's speech is exceedingly admired, with the exception of his  having said more than he was justified to do about the right of  search.[5] Our speech has been very difficult to frame; we should like  to have mentioned our visits to France and Belgium, but it has been  found impossible to do so; _France is_ mentioned, and it is the first  time since 1834!    To-morrow we go up to Town \"pour ce bore,\" as the good King always  said to me; whenever there were tiresome people to present he always  said: \"Je vous demande pardon de ce _bore_.\"    I have had a tiresome though not at all violent cold which _I was_  alarmed might spoil the _sonorousness_ of my voice for the speech on  Thursday, but it promises well now.    I own I always look with horror to the beginning of a Parliamentary  campaign.    With Albert's love. Ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 5: He insisted that French trade must be kept under      the exclusive surveillance of the French flag.]          [Pageheading: DEATH OF THE DUKE OF COBURG]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _6th February 1844._    MY DEARLY BELOVED UNCLE,--_You_ must now be the father to us poor  bereaved, heartbroken children.[6] To describe to you _all_ that we  _have_ suffered, all that we _do_ suffer, would be difficult; God has  heavily afflicted us; we feel crushed, overwhelmed, bowed down by  the loss of one who was so deservedly loved, I may say adored, by his  children and family; I loved him and looked on him as my own father;  his like we shall _not see again_; that youth, _that amiability_, and  kindness in his own house which was the centre and rendezvous for the  whole family, will never be seen again, and my poor Angel's fondest  thought of beholding that _dearly beloved Vaterhaus_--where his  thoughts continually were--_again_ is for ever gone and his poor  heart bleeds to feel _this_ is for ever gone. Our promised visit,  our dearest Papa's, and our fondest wish, all is put an end to. The  violence of our grief may be over, but the desolate feeling which  succeeds it is worse, and tears are a relief. I have never known real  _grief_ till now, and it has made a lasting impression on me. A father  is _such_ a _near_ relation, you are a _piece_ of him in fact,--and  all (as my poor _deeply afflicted_ Angel says) the earliest pleasures  of your life were given you by a dear father; that can _never be  replaced_ though time may soften the pang. And indeed one loves to  _cling_ to one's grief; I can understand Louise's feeling in her  overwhelming sorrows.    Let me now join my humble entreaties to Albert's, relative to the  request about dearest Louise, which he has made. It is a sacrifice  I ask, but if you _knew_ the sacrifice I make in letting and urging  Albert _to go_, I am sure, if you _can_ you _will_ grant it. I have  _never_ been separated from him even for _one night_, and the _thought  of such_ a separation is quite dreadful; still, I feel I _could_ bear  it,--I have made up my mind to it, as the very _thought_ of going has  been a comfort to my poor Angel, and will be of such use at Coburg.  Still, if I were to remain _quite_ alone I do not think I _could_ bear  it quietly. Therefore _pray_ do send me my dearly beloved Louise; she  would be _such_ a comfort to me; if you could come too--or afterwards  (as you promised us a longer visit), that would be still more  delightful. I may be indiscreet, but you must think of _what_ the  separation from my _all and all_, even only for a _fortnight_, will be  to me!    We feel some _years_ older since these days of mourning. Mamma is  calm, but poor Aunt Julia[7] is indeed much to be pitied. Ever,  dearest Uncle, your devoted and unhappy Niece and Child,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 6: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha died on 29th      January.]        [Footnote 7: The Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia,      sister of the Duchess of Kent and of the deceased Duke of      Saxe-Coburg.]          [Pageheading: BEREAVEMENT]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _13th February 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your dear, kind but sad letter of the  8th on Sunday, and thank you much for it. God knows, poor dear Uncle,  you have suffered _enough_ in your life, but you should think, dearest  Uncle, of _that blessed_ assurance of _eternity_ where we shall _all  meet again never_ to part; you should think (as we constantly do now)  that those whom we have lost are far happier than we are, and _love  us_ still, and in a far more perfect way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#3)"],[1,"eguilleville's _ABC_ or  _Prayer to the Virgin_, of which the successive stanzas start with A, B,  C, and run all thro' the alphabet; and it has 2 main gaps, besides many  small ones from the tops of leaves being burnt in the Cotton fire. All  these gaps (save the A B C) have been fild up from the Stowe MS. 952  (which old John Stowe completed) and from the end of the other imperfect  MS. Cotton, Tiberius A vii. Thanks to the diligence of the old  Elizabethan tailor and manuscript-lover, a complete text of Lydgate's  poem can be given, though that of an inserted theological prose treatise  is incomplete. The British Museum French MSS. (Harleian 4399,[7] and  Additional 22,937[8] and 25,594[9]) are all of the First Version.    Besides his first _Pèlerinaige de l'homme_ in its two versions,  Deguilleville wrote a second, \"de l'ame separee du corps,\" and a third,  \"de nostre seigneur Iesus.\" Of the second, a prose Englishing of 1413,  _The Pilgrimage of the Sowle_ (with poems by Hoccleve, already printed  for the Society with that author's _Regement of Princes_), exists in the  Egerton MS. 615,[10] at Hatfield, Cambridge (Univ. Kk. 1. 7, and Caius),  Oxford (Univ. Coll. and Corpus), and in Caxton's edition of 1483. This  version has 'somewhat of addicions' as Caxton says, and some shortenings  too, as the maker of both, the first translater, tells us in the MSS.  Caxton leaves out the earlier englisher's interesting Epilog in the  Egerton MS. This prose englishing of the _Sowle_ will be edited for the  Society by Prof. Dr. Leon Kellner after that of the _Man_ is finisht,  and will have Gallopes's French opposite it, from Lord Aldenham's MS.,  as his gift to the Society. Of the Pilgrimage of Jesus, no englishing is  known.    As to the MS. Anglo-Saxon Psalters, Dr. Hy. Sweet has edited the oldest  MS., the Vespasian, in his _Oldest English Texts_ for the Society, and  Mr. Harsley has edited the latest, c. 1150, Eadwine's Canterbury  Psalter. The other MSS., except the Paris one, being interlinear  versions,--some of the Roman-Latin redaction, and some of the  Gallican,--Prof. Logeman has prepared for press, a Parallel-Text edition  of the first twelve Psalms, to start the complete work. He will do his  best to get the Paris Psalter--tho' it is not an interlinear one--into  this collective edition; but the additional matter, especially in the  Verse-Psalms, is very difficult to manage. If the Paris text cannot be  parallelised, it will form a separate volume. The Early English Psalters  are all independent versions, and will follow separately in due course.    Through the good offices of the Examiners, some of the books for the  Early-English Examinations of the University of London will be chosen  from the Society's publications, the Committee having undertaken to  supply such books to students at a large reduction in price. The net  profits from these sales will be applied to the Society's Reprints.    Members are reminded that _fresh Subscribers are always wanted_, and  that the Committee can at anytime, on short notice, send to press an  additional Thousand Pounds' worth of work.    The Subscribers to the Original Series must be prepared for the issue of  the whole of the Early English _Lives of Saints_, sooner or later. The  Society cannot leave out any of them, even though some are dull. The  Sinners would doubtless be much more interesting. But in many Saints'  Lives will be found valuable incidental details of our forefathers'  social state, and all are worthful for the history of our language. The  Lives may be lookt on as the religious romances or story-books of their  period.    The Standard Collection of Saints' Lives in the Corpus and Ashmole MSS.,  the Harleian MS. 2277, &c. will repeat the Laud set, our No. 87, with  additions, and in right order. (The foundation MS. (Laud 108) had to be  printed first, to prevent quite unwieldy collations.) The Supplementary  Lives from the Vernon and other MSS. will form one or two separate  volumes.    Besides the Saints' Lives, Trevisa's englishing of _Bartholomæus de  Proprietatibus Rerum_, the mediæval Cyclopædia of Science, &c, will be  the Society's next big undertaking. Dr. R. von Fleischhacker will edit  it. Prof. Napier of Oxford, wishing to have the whole of our MS.  Anglo-Saxon in type, and accessible to students, will edit for the  Society all the unprinted and other Anglo-Saxon Homilies which are not  included in Thorpe's edition of Ælfric's prose,[11] Dr. Morris's of the  Blickling Homilies, and Prof. Skeat's of Ælfric's Metrical Homilies. The  late Prof. Kölbing left complete his text, for the Society, of the  _Ancren Riwle_, from the best MS., with collations of the other four,  and this will be edited for the Society by Dr. Thümmler. Mr. Harvey  means to prepare an edition of the three MSS. of the _Earliest English  Metrical Psalter_, one of which was edited by the late Mr. Stevenson for  the Surtees Society.    Members of the Society will learn with pleasure that its example has  been followed, not only by the Old French Text Society which has done  such admirable work under its founders Profs. Paul Meyer and Gaston  Paris, but also by the Early Russian Text Society, which was set on foot  in 1877, and has since issued many excellent editions of old MS.  Chronicles, &c.    Members will also note with pleasure the annexation of large tracts of  our Early English territory by the important German contingent, the late  Professors Zupitza and Kölbing, the living Hausknecht, Einenkel,  Haenisch, Kaluza, Hupe, Adam, Holthausen, Schick, Herzfeld, Brandeis,  Sieper, Konrath, Wülfing, &c. Scandinavia has also sent us Prof. Erdmann  and Dr. E. A. Kock; Holland, Prof. H. Logeman, who is now working in  Belgium; France, Prof. Paul Meyer--with Gaston Paris as adviser (alas,  now dead);--Italy, Prof. Lattanzi; Austria, Dr. von Fleischhacker; while  America is represented by the late Prof. Child, by Dr. Mary Noyes  Colvin, Miss Rickert, Profs. Mead, McKnight, Triggs, Perrin, &c. The  sympathy, the ready help, which the Society's work has cald forth from  the Continent and the United States, have been among the pleasantest  experiences of the Society's life, a real aid and cheer amid all  troubles and discouragements. All our Members are grateful for it, and  recognise that the bond their work has woven between them and the lovers  of language and antiquity across the seas is one of the most welcome  results of the Society's efforts.
