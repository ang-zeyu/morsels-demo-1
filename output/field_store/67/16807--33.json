An accident of this kind is particularly likely  to happen if the glass be at all reduced.  Hence, if a joint does not  crack when cold, the presumption is, in the case of soda glass, that  the joint is perfectly made, and will not allow of any leak;  but this  is not the case with flint glass, for which reason all joints between  flint glass tubes require the most minute examination before they are  passed.  If there are any air bubbles in the glass, especial care must  be exercised.    Sec. 9.  Hard or Bohemian, Glass.    This is, of course, used where high temperatures are to be employed,  and also in certain cases where its comparative insolubility in water  is of importance.  It is very unusual for the investigator to have to  make complicated apparatus from this glass.  Fused joints may be made  between hard glass and flint glass without using enamel, and though  they often break in the course of time, still there is no reason  against their employment, provided the work be done properly, and they  are not required to last too long.    Sec. 10.  On the Choice of Sizes of Glass Tube.    It will be found that for general purposes tubes about one-quarter  inch in inside diameter, and from one-twentieth to one-fortieth of an  inch thick, are most in demand.  Some very thin soda glass of these  dimensions (so-called \"cylinder\" tubes) will be found very handy for  many purposes.  For physico-chemical work a good supply of tubing,  from one-half to three-quarters of an inch inside diameter, and from  one-twentieth to one-eighth inch thick, is very necessary.  A few  tubes up to three inches diameter, and of various thicknesses, will  also be required for special purposes.    Thermometer and \"barometer\" tubing is occasionally required, the  latter, by the way, making particularly bad barometers.  The  thermometer tubing should be of all sizes of bore, from the finest  obtainable up to that which has a bore of about one-sixteenth of an  inch.  Glass rods varying from about one-twentieth of an inch in  diameter up to, say, half an inch will be required, also two or three  sticks of white enamel glass for making joints.    To facilitate choice, there is appended a diagram of sizes from the  catalogue of a reliable German firm, Messrs. Desaga of Heidelberg, and  the experimenter will be able to see at a glance what sizes of glass  to order.  It is a good plan to stock the largest and smallest size of  each material as well as the most useful working sizes.    Fig.  1.    Sec. 11.  Testing Glass.    \"Reject glass which has lumps or knots, is obviously conical, or has  long drawn-out bubbles running through the substance.\" If a scratch be  made on the surface of a glass tube, and one end of the scratch be  touched by a very fine point of fused glass, say not more than  one-sixteenth inch in diameter, the tube, however large it is (within  reason), ought to crack in the direction of the scratch.  If a big  crack forms and does not run straight, but tends to turn  longitudinally, it is a sign that the glass is ill annealed, and  nothing can be done with it.  If such glass be hit upon in the course  of blow-pipe work, it is inadvisable to waste time upon it; the best  plan is to reject it at once, and save it for some experiment where it  will not have to be heated.    The shortest way of selecting glass is to go to a good firm, and let  it be understood that if the glass proves to be badly annealed it will  be returned.  Though it was stated above that the glass should not be  distinctly conical, of course allowance must be made for the length of  the pieces, and, on the other hand, a few highly conical tubes will be  of immense service in special cases, and a small supply of such should  be included.    The glass, as it is obtained, should be placed in a rack, and covered  by a cloth to reduce the quantity of dust finding its way into the  tubes.  It has been stated by Professor Ostwald that tubes when reared  up on end tend to bend permanently.  I have not noticed this with lead  glass well supported.  Each different supply should be kept by itself  and carefully described on a label pasted on to the rack, and tubes  from different lots should not be used for critical welds.  This  remark is more important in the case of soda than of lead glass.    In the case of very fine thermometer tubes it will be advisable to  cover the ends with a little melted shellac, or, in special cases, to  obtain the tubes sealed from the works.  Soda glass can generally be  got in rather longer lengths than lead glass;  the longer the lengths  are the better, for the waste is less.    It is useful to be able to distinguish the different kinds of glass by  the colour.  This is best observed by looking towards a bright surface  along the whole length of the tube and through the glass.  Lead glass  is yellow, soda glass is green, and hard glass purple in the samples  in my laboratory, and I expect this is practically true of most  samples.  [Footnote: Some new lead glass I have is also almost purple  in hue.  If any doubt exists as to the kind of glass, it may be tested  at once in the blow-pipe flame, or by a mixture of oils of different  refractive indices, as will be explained later.]    Sec. 12.  The question of the solubility of glass in reagents is one of  great importance in accurate work, though it does not always meet with  the attention it deserves.  It is impossible here to go into the  matter with sufficient detail, and the reader is therefore referred to  the Abstracts of the Chemical Society, particularly for the years 1889  and 1892.  The memoir by F.  Kohlrausch, Wied.  Ann.  xliv, should be  consulted in the original.  The following points may be noted.  A  method of testing the quality of glass is given by Mylius (C.  S.  J.  Abstracts, 1889, p.  549), and it is stated that the resistance of  glass to the action of water can generally be much increased by  leaving it in contact with cold water for several days, and then  heating it to 300 deg. to 400 deg. C.  This improvement seems to be due to the  formation of a layer of moist silica on the surface, and its  subsequent condensation into a resisting layer by the heating.  Mylius  (C.  S.  J.  Abstracts, 1892, p.  411), and Weber, and Sauer (C.  S.  J.  Abstracts, 1892, p.  410) have also shown that the best glass for  general chemical purposes consists of:    Silica, 7 to 8 parts    Lime, 1 part    Alkali, 1.5 to 1.1 parts.    This is practically \"Bohemian\" tube glass.    The exact results are given in the Berichte of the German Chemical  Society, vol.  xxv.  An excellent account of the properties of glass  will be found in Grove's edition of Miller's Elements of Chemistry.    Sec. 13.  Cleaning Glass Tubes.    This is one of the most important arts in chemistry.  If the tubes are  new, they are generally only soiled by dust, and can be cleaned fairly  easily--first by pushing a bit of cotton waste through with a cane,  or pulling a rag through with string--and then washing with sand and  commercial hydrochloric acid.  I have heard of glass becoming  scratched by this process, and breaking in consequence when heated,  but have never myself experienced this inconvenience.  In German  laboratories little bits of bibulous paper are sometimes used instead  of sand; they soon break into a pulp, and this pulp has a slightly  scouring action.    As soon as the visible impurities are removed and the tube when washed  looks bright and clean, it may be wiped on the outside and held  perpendicularly so as to allow the water film to drain down.  If the  tube be greasy (and perhaps in other cases) it will be observed that  as the film gets thinner the water begins to break away and leave dry  spots.  For accurate work this grease, or whatever it is, must be  removed;  and after trying many plans for many years, I have come back  to the method I first employed, viz.  boiling out with aqua regia.    For this purpose, close one end of the tube by a cork (better than a  rubber bung, because cheaper), and half fill the tube with aqua regia;  then, having noted the greasy places, proceed to boil the liquid in  contact with the glass at these points, and in the case of very  obstinate dirt--such as lingers round a fused joint which has been  made between undusted tubes--leave the whole affair for twelve hours.  If the greasiness is only slight, then simply shaking with hot aqua  regia will often remove it, and the aqua regia is conveniently heated  in this case by the addition of a little strong sulphuric acid.    The spent aqua regia may be put into a bottle.  It is generally quite  good enough for the purpose of washing glass vessels with sand, as  above explained.    However carefully a tube is cleaned before being subjected to blowpipe  operations, it will be fouled wherever there is an opening during the  process of heating, unless the extreme tip only of an oxidising flame  be employed.  Even this should not be trusted too implicitly unless  an oxygas or hydrogen flame is employed.    When a tube or piece of apparatus has been cleaned by acid, so that on  clamping it vertically, dry spaces do not appear, it may be rinsed  with platinum distilled water and left to drain, the dust being, of  course, kept out by placing a bit of paper round the top.  For  accurate work water thus prepared is to be preferred to anything else.  When the glass is very clean interference colours will be noticed as  the water dries away.    Carefully-purified alcohol may in some cases be employed where it is  desired to dry the tube or apparatus quickly.  In this case an alcohol  wash bottle should be used, and a little alcohol squirted into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],[0,"The accomplisht cook (#3)"],[1,"other some live Birds; make these Pyes of course  Paste filled with bran, and yellowed over with saffron or the yolks  of eggs, guild them over in spots, as also the Stag, the Ship, and  Castle; bake them, and place them with guilt bay-leaves on turrets  and tunnels of the Castle and Pyes; being baked, make a hole in the  bottom of your pyes, take out the bran, put in your Frogs, and  Birds, and close up the holes with the same course paste, then cut  the Lids neatly up; To be taken off the Tunnels; being all placed in  order upon the Table, before you fire the trains of powder, order it  so that some of the Ladies may be perswaded to pluck the Arrow out  of the Stag, then will the Claret-wine follow, as blood that runneth  out of a wound.
