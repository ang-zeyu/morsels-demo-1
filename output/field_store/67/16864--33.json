FOOTNOTES:        [Footnote 1: D. Lardner, _Handbook of Astronomy_, 3rd ed., p. 288.]        [Footnote 2: But not one of them was visible at Greenwich.]        [Footnote 3: Latin _Annulus_, a ring.]                                       CHAPTER III.                 THE \"SAROS\" AND THE PERIODICITY OF ECLIPSES.      To bring about an eclipse of the Sun, two things must combine: (1) the  Moon must be at or near one of its Nodes; and (2), this must be at a  time when the Moon is also in \"Conjunction\" with the Sun. Now the Moon  is in Conjunction with the Sun (= \"New Moon\") 12 or 13 times in a year,  but the Sun only passes through the Nodes of the Moon's orbit twice a  year. Hence an eclipse of the Sun does not and cannot occur at every New  Moon, but only occasionally. An _exact_ coincidence of Earth, Moon, and  Sun, in a straight line at a Node is not necessary to ensure an eclipse  of the Sun. So long as the Moon is within about 181/2 deg. of its Node, with a  latitude of not more than 1 deg. 34', an eclipse _may_ take place. If,  however, the distance is less than 151/4 deg. and the latitude less than  1 deg. 23' an eclipse _must_ take place, though between these limits[4] the  occurrence of an eclipse is uncertain and depends on what are called the  \"horizontal parallaxes\" and the \"apparent semi-diameters\" of the two  bodies at the moment of conjunction, in other words, on the nearness or  \"far-offness\" of the bodies in question. Another complication is  introduced into these matters by reason of the fact that the Nodes of  the Moon's orbit do not occupy a fixed position, but have an annual  retrograde motion of about 191/4 deg., in virtue of which a complete  revolution of the Nodes round the ecliptic is accomplished in 18 years  218-7/8 days (= 18.5997 years).    The backward movement of the Moon's Nodes combined with the apparent  motion of the Sun in the ecliptic causes the Moon in its monthly course  round the Earth to complete a revolution with respect to its Nodes in a  less time (27.2 days) than it takes to get back to Conjunction with the  Sun (29.5 days); and a curious consequence, as we shall see directly,  flows from these facts and from one other fact. The other fact is to the  Sun starting coincident with one of the Moon's Nodes, returns on the  Ecliptic to the same Node in 346.6 days. The first named period of 27.2  days is called the \"_Nodical_ Revolution of the Moon\" or \"Draconic  Month,\" the other period of 29.5 days is called the \"_Synodical_  Revolution of the Moon.\" Now the curious consequence of these figures  being what they are is that 242 Draconic Months, 223 Lunations, and 19  Returns of the Sun to one and the same Node of the Moon's orbit, are all  accomplished in the same time within 11 hours. Thus (ignoring  refinements of decimals):--                   Days     Days.  Years.  Days.  Hours.        242 times  27.2 = 6585.36 = 18      10      81/2      223 times  29.5 = 6585.32 = 18      10      73/4       19 times 346.6 = 6585.78 = 18      10     183/4    The interpretation to be put upon these coincidences is this: that  supposing Sun and Moon to start together from a Node they would, after  the lapse of 6585 days and a fraction, be found again together very near  the same Node. During the interval there would have been 223 New and  Full Moons. The exact time required for 223 Lunations is such that in  the case supposed the 223rd conjunction of the two bodies would happen a  little before they reached the Node; their distance therefrom would be  28' of arc. And the final fact is that eclipses recur in almost, though  not quite, the same regular order every 6585-1/3 days, or more exactly, 18  years, 10 days, 7 hours, 42 minutes.[5] This is the celebrated Chaldean  \"SAROS,\" and was used by the ancients (and can still be used by the  moderns in the way of a pastime) for the prediction of eclipses alike of  the Sun and of the Moon.                       *       *       *       *       *    At the end of a Saros period, starting from any date that may have been  chosen, the Moon will be in the same position with respect to the Sun,  nearly in the same part of the heavens, nearly in the same part of its  orbit, and very nearly indeed at the same distance from its Node as at  the date chosen for the _terminus a quo_ of the Saros. But there are  trifling discrepancies in the case (the difference of about 11 hours  between 223 lunations and 19 returns of the Sun to the Moon's Node is  one) and these have an appreciable effect in disturbing not so much the  sequence of the eclipses in the next following Saros as their magnitude  and visibility at given places on the Earth's surface. Hence, a more  accurate succession will be obtained by combining 3 Saros periods,  making 54 years, 31 days; while, best of all, to secure an almost  perfect repetition of a series of eclipses will be a combination of 48  Saroses, making 865 years for the Moon; and of about 70 Saroses, or more  than 1200 years for the Sun.    These considerations are leading us rather too far afield. Let us return  to a more simple condition of things. The practical use of the Saros in  its most elementary conception is somewhat on this wise. Given 18 or 19  old Almanacs ranging, say, from 1880 to 1898, how can we turn to account  the information they afford us in order to obtain from them information  respecting the eclipses which will happen between 1899 and 1917?  Nothing easier. Add 18^y 10^d 7^h 42^m to the middle time of every  eclipse which took place between 1880 and 1898 beginning, say, with the  last of 1879 or the first of 1880, and we shall find what eclipses will  happen in 1898 and 17 following years, as witness by way of example the  following table:--                                                Error of Saros by                               d.  h. m.

If the Saros comprised an exact number of days, each eclipse of a second  Saros series would be visible in the same regions of the Earth as the  corresponding eclipse in the previous series. But since there is a  surplus fraction of nearly one-third of a day, each subsequent eclipse  will be visible in another region of the Earth, which will be roughly a  third of the Earth's circumference in longitude backwards (_i.e._ about  120 deg. to the W.),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#3)"],[1,"swim in the sea. We desire, of course, to  secure a high tide for the purpose of doing so, and we call an almanac  to help us. I refer to the Thom's Dublin Directory, where I find the  tide to be high at 10h. 14m. on the morning of the 18th of August.  That will then be the time to go down to the baths at Howth or  Kingstown.    But what I am now going to discourse to you about is not the delights  of sea-bathing, it is rather a different inquiry. I want to ask, How  did the people who prepared that almanac know years beforehand, that  on that particular day the tide would be high at that particular hour?  How do they predict for every day the hour of high water? and how  comes it to pass that these predictions are invariably correct?    We first refer to that wonderful book, the _Nautical Almanac_. In that  volume the movements of the moon are set forth with full detail; and  among other particulars we can learn on page iv of every month the  mean time of the moon's meridian passage. It appears that on the day  in question the moon crossed the meridian at 11h. 23m. Thus we see  there was high water at Dublin at 10h. 14m., and 1h. 9m. later, that  is, at 11h. 23m., the moon crossed the meridian.    Let us take another instance. There is a high tide at 3.40 P.M. on the  25th August, and again the infallible _Nautical Almanac_ tells us that  the moon crossed the meridian at 5h. 44m., that is, at 2h. 4m. after  the high water.    In the first case the moon followed the tide in about an hour, and in  the second case the moon followed in about two hours. Now if we are to  be satisfied with a very rough tide rule for Dublin, we may say  generally that there is always a high tide an hour and a half before  the moon crosses the meridian. This would not be a very accurate  rule, but I can assure you of this, that if you go by it you will  never fail of finding a good tide to enable you to enjoy your swim. I  do not say this rule would enable you to construct a respectable  tide-table. A ship-owner who has to creep up the river, and to whom  often the inches of water are material, will require far more accurate  tables than this simple rule could give. But we enter into rather  complicated matters when we attempt to give any really accurate  methods of computation. On these we shall say a few words presently.  What I first want to do, is to impress upon you in a simple way the  fact of the relation between the tide and the moon.    To give another illustration, let us see how the tides at London  Bridge are related to the moon. On Jan. 1st, 1887, it appeared that  the tide was high at 6h. 26m. P.M., and that the moon had crossed the  meridian 56m. previously; on the 8th Jan. the tide was high at 0h.  43m. P.M., and the moon had crossed the meridian 2h. 1m. previously.  Therefore we would have at London Bridge high water following the  moon's transit in somewhere about an hour and a half.    I choose a day at random, for example--the 12th April. The moon  crosses the upper meridian at 3h. 39m. A.M., and the lower meridian at  4h 6m. P.M. Adding an hour and a half to each would give the high  tides at 5h 9m. A.M. and 5h. 36m. P.M.; as a matter of fact, they are  4h. 58m. A.M. and 5h. 20m. P.M.    But these illustrations are sufficient. We find that at London, in a  general way, high water appears at London Bridge about an hour and a  half after the moon has passed the meridian of London. It so happens  that the interval at Dublin is about the same, _i.e._ an hour and a  half; only that in the latter case the high water precedes the moon by  that interval instead of following it. We may employ the same simple  process at other places. Choose two days about a week distant; find on  each occasion the interval between the transit of the moon and the  time of high water, then the mean of these two differences will always  give some notion of the interval between high water and the moon's  transit. If then we take from the _Nautical Almanac_ the time of the  moon's transit, and apply to it the correction proper for the port,  we shall always have a sufficiently good tide-table to guide us in  choosing a suitable time for taking our swim or our walk by the  sea-side; though if you be the captain of a vessel, you will not be so  imprudent as to enter port without taking counsel of the accurate  tide-tables, for which we are indebted to the Admiralty.    Every one who visits the sea-side, or who lives at a sea-port, should  know this constant for the tides, which affect him and his movements  so materially. If he will discover it from his own experience, so much  the better.    The first point to be ascertained is the time of high water. Do not  take this from any local table; you ought to observe it for yourself.  You will go to the pier head, or, better still, to some place where  the rise and fall of the mere waves of the sea will not embarrass you  in your work. You must note by your watch the time when the tide is  highest. An accurate way of doing this will be to have a scale on  which you can measure the height at intervals of five minutes about  the time of high water. You will then be able to conclude the time at  which the tide was actually at its highest point; but even if no  great accuracy be obtainable, you can still get much interesting  information, for you will without much difficulty be right within ten  minutes or a quarter of an hour.    The correction for the port is properly called the \"establishment,\"  this being the average time of high water on the days of full and  change of the moon at the particular port in question.    We can considerably amend the elementary notion of the tides which the  former method has given us, if we adopt the plan described by Dr.  Whewell in the first four editions of the _Admiralty Manual of  Scientific Inquiry_. We speak of the interval between the transit of  the moon and the time of high water as the luni-tidal interval. Of  course at full and change this is the same thing as the establishment,  but for other phases of the moon the establishment must receive a  correction before being used as the luni-tidal interval. The  correction is given by the following table--    Hour of Moon's transit after Sun:    0| 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11  -+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----  0|-20m|-30m|-50m|-60m|-60m|-60m|-40m|-10m|+10m|+20m|+10m    Correction of establishment to find luni-tidal interval:    Thus at a port where the establishment was 3h. 25m., let us suppose  that the transit of the moon took place at 6 P.M.; then we correct the  establishment by -60m., and find the luni-tidal interval to be 2h.  25m., and accordingly the high water takes place at 8h. 25m. P.M.    But even this method is only an approximation. The study of the tides  is based on accurate observation of their rise and fall on different  places round the earth. To show how these observations are to be made,  and how they are to be discussed and reduced when they have been made,  I may refer to the last edition of the _Admiralty Manual of Scientific  Inquiry_, 1886. For a complete study of the tides at any port a  self-registering tide-gauge should be erected, on which not alone the  heights and times of high and low water should be depicted, but also  the continuous curve which shows at any time the height of the water.  In fact, the whole subject of the practical observation and discussion  and prediction of tides is full of valuable instruction, and may be  cited as one of the most complete examples of the modern scientific  methods.    In the first place, the tide-gauge itself is a delicate instrument;  it is actuated by a float which rises and falls with the water, due  provision being made that the mere influence of waves shall not make  it to oscillate inconveniently. The motion of the float when suitably  reduced by mechanism serves to guide a pencil, which, acting on the  paper round a revolving drum, gives a faithful and unintermitting  record of the height of the water.    Thus what the tide-gauge does is to present to us a long curved line  of which the summits correspond to the heights of high water, while  the depressions are the corresponding points of low water. The long  undulations of this curve are, however, very irregular. At spring  tides, when the sun and the moon conspire, the elevations rise much  higher and the depressions sink much lower than they do at neap tides,  when the high water raised by the moon is reduced by the action of the  sun. There are also many minor irregularities which show the tides to  be not nearly such simple phenomena as might be at first supposed. But  what we might hastily think of as irregularities are, in truth, the  most interesting parts of the whole phenomena. Just as in the  observations of the planets the study of the perturbations has led us  to results of the widest interest and instruction, so it is these  minor phenomena of the tides which seem most pregnant with scientific  interest.    The tide-gauge gives us an elaborate curve. How are we to interpret  that curve? Here indeed a most beautiful mathematical theorem comes to  our aid. Just as ordinary sounds consist of a number of undulations  blended together, so the tidal wave consists of a number of distinct  undulations superposed. Of these the ordinary lunar tide and the  ordinary solar tide are the two principal; but there are also minor  undulations, harmonics, so to speak, some originating from the moon,  some originating from the sun, and some from both bodies acting in  concert.    In the study of sound we can employ an acoustic apparatus for the  purpose of decomposing any proposed note, and finding not only the  main undulation itself, but the several superposed harmonics which  give to the note its timbre. So also we can analyze the undulation of  the tide, and show the component parts. The decomposition is effected  by the process"]]]
