There  were also lingering among them the surviving families of an earlier and  a conquered race, perhaps Basques or Finns. When the country was  conquered by the Celts we do not know. Nor is there any record at all of  the people they found here unless the caves, full of the bones which  they gnawed and cut in two for the marrow, were the homes of these  earlier occupants.    When the Romans came they found the town prosperous. That is all we  know. What the town was like we do not know. It is, however, probable  that the requirements of trade had already necessitated some form of  embankment and some kind of quay; also, if trade were of long standing,  some improvement in the huts, the manner of living, the wants, and the  dress of the people would certainly have been introduced.    Such was the beginning of London. Let us repeat.    It was a small fortress defended on three sides by earthworks, by  stockades, by a cliff or steeply sloping bank, and by streams; on the  fourth side by an earthwork, stockade, and trench. The ground was  slightly irregular, rising from 30 to 60 feet. An open moor full of  quagmires and ponds also protected it on the north. On the east on the  other side of the stream rose another low hill. The extent of this  British fort of Llyn-din may be easily estimated. The distance from  Walbrook to the Fleet is very nearly 900 yards; supposing the fort was  500 yards in depth from south to north we have an area of 450,000 square  yards, i.e. about 100 acres was occupied by the first London, the  Fortress on the Lake. What this town was like in its later days when the  Romans found it; what buildings stood upon it; how the people lived, we  know very little indeed. They went out to fight, we know so much; and if  you visit Hampstead Heath you may look at a barrow on the top of a hill  which probably contains the bones of those citizens of London who fell  in the victory which they achieved over the citizens of Verulam when  they fought it out in the valley below that hill.          3. ROMAN LONDON.    PART I.      The Romans, when they resolved to settle in England, established  themselves on the opposite hillock, the eastern bank of the Walbrook.  The situation was not so strong as that of the British town, because it  was protected by cliff and river on two sides only instead of three. But  the Romans depended on their walls and their arms rather than the  position of their town. As was their habit they erected here a strong  fortress or a stationary camp, such as others which remain in the  country. Perhaps the Roman building which most resembles this fort is  the walled enclosure called Porchester, which stands at the head of  Portsmouth Harbour. This is rectangular in shape and is contained by a  high wall built of rubble stone and narrow bricks, with round, hollow  bastions at intervals. One may also see such a stationary camp at  Richborough, near Sandwich; and at Pevensey, in Sussex; and at  Silchester, near Reading, but the two latter are not rectangular. One  end of this fort was on the top of the Walbrook bank and the other, if  you look in your map, on the site of Mincing Lane. This gives a length  of about 700 yards by a breadth of 350, which means an enclosure of  about 50 acres. This is a large area: it was at once the barrack, the  arsenal, and the treasury of the station; it contained the residences of  the officers, the offices of the station, the law court and tribunals,  and the prisons; it was the official residence. Outside the fort on the  north was the burial place. If we desire to know the character of the  buildings we may assure ourselves that they were not mean or ignoble by  visiting the Roman town of Silchester. Here we find that the great Hall  of Justice was a hall more spacious than Westminster Hall, though  doubtless not so lofty or so fine. Attached to this hall were other  smaller rooms for the administration of justice; on one side was an open  court with a cloister or corridor running all round it and shops at the  back for the sale of everything. This was the centre of the city: here  the courts were held; this was the Exchange; here were the baths; this  was the place where the people resorted in the morning and lounged about  to hear the news; here the jugglers and the minstrels and the acrobats  came to perform; it was the very centre of the life of the city--as was  Silchester so was London.    [Illustration: _Walker & Boutallse._    ROMAN LONDON.]    Outside the Citadel the rude British town--if it was still a rude  town--disappeared rapidly. The security of the place, strongly  garrisoned, the extension of Roman manners, the introduction of Roman  customs, dress, and luxuries gave a great impetus to the development of  the City. The little ports of the rivers Walbrook and Fleet no longer  sufficed for the shipping which now came up the river; if there were as  yet no quays or embankments they were begun to be erected; behind them  rose warehouses and wharves. The cliff began to be cut away; a steep  slope took its place; its very existence was forgotten. The same thing  has happened at Brighton, where, almost within the memory of living man,  a low cliff ran along the beach. This embankment extended east and  west--as far as the Fleet River, which is now Blackfriars, on the west,  and what is now Tower Hill on the east. Then, the trade still  increasing, the belt of ground behind the embankment became filled with  a dense population of riverside people--boatmen, sailors, boat-builders,  store-keepers, bargemen, stevedores, porters--all the people who belong  to a busy mercantile port. As for the better sort, they lived round the  Citadel, protected by its presence, in villas, remains of which have  been found in many places.    The two things which most marked the Roman occupation were London Wall  and Bridge. Of the latter we will speak in another place. The wall was  erected at a time between A.D. 350 and A.D. 369--very near the end of  the Roman occupation. This wall remained the City wall for more than a  thousand years; it was rebuilt, repaired, restored; the scanty remains  of it--a few fragments here and there--contain very little of the  original wall; but the course of the wall was never altered, and we know  exactly how it ran. There was first a strong river wall along the  northern bank. There were three water gates and the Bridge gate; there  were two land gates at Newgate and Bishopsgate. The wall was 3 miles and  205 yards long; the area enclosed was 380 acres. This shows that the  population must have been already very large, for the Romans were not  accustomed to erect walls longer than they could defend.          4. ROMAN LONDON.    PART II.      We must think of Roman London as of a small stronghold on a low hill  rising out of the river. It is a strongly-walled place, within which is  a garrison of soldiers; outside its walls stretch gardens and villas,  many of them rich and beautiful, filled with costly things. Below the  fort is a long river wall or quay covered with warehouses, bales of  goods, and a busy multitude of men at work. Some are slaves--perhaps  all. Would you like to know what a Roman villa was like? It was in plan  a small, square court, surrounded on three sides by a cloister or  corridor with pillars, and behind the cloister the rooms of the house;  the middle part of the court was a garden, and in front was another and  a larger garden. The house was of one storey, the number and size of the  rooms varying according to the size of the house. On one side were the  winter divisions, on the other were the summer rooms. The former part  was kept warm by means of a furnace constructed below the house, which  supplied hot-air pipes running up all the walls. At the back of the  house were the kitchen, stables, and sleeping quarters of the servants.  Tesselated pavements, statues, pictures, carvings, hangings, pillows,  and fine glass adorned the house. There was not in London the enormous  wealth which enabled some of the Romans to live in palaces, but there  was comparative wealth--the wealth which enables a man to procure for  himself in reason all the things that he desires.    The City as it grew in prosperity was honoured by receiving the name of  Augusta. It remained in Roman hands for nearly four hundred years. The  Citadel, which marks the first occupation by the Romans, was probably  built about A.D. 43. The Romans went away in A.D. 410. During these four  centuries the people became entirely Romanised. Add to this that they  became Christians. Augusta was a Christian city; the churches which  stand--or stood, because three at least have been removed--along Thames  Street, probably occupied the sites of older Roman churches. In this  part of the City the people were thickest; in this quarter, therefore,  stood the greater number of churches: the fact that they were mostly  dedicated to the apostles instead of to later Saxon saints seems to show  that they stood on the sites of Roman churches. It has been asked why  there has never been found any heathen temple in London; the answer is  that London under the Romans very early became Christian; if there had  been a temple of Diana or Apollo it would have been destroyed or  converted into a church. Such remains of Augusta as have been found are  inconsiderable: they are nearly all in the museum of the Guildhall,  where they should be visited and examined.    The history of Roman London is meagre. Seventeen years after the  building of the Citadel, on the rebellion of Boadicea, the Roman general  Suetonius abandoned the place, as unable to defend it. All those who  remained were massacred by the insurgents. After this, so far as we  know, for history is silent, there was peace in London for 200 years.  Then one Carausius, an officer in command of the fleet stationed in the  Channel for the suppression of piracies, assumed the title of emperor.

The arrangement of the Suras in this translation is based partly upon the  traditions of the Muhammadans themselves, with reference especially to the  ancient chronological list printed by Weil in his Mohammed der Prophet, as  well as upon a careful consideration of the subject matter of each separate  Sura and its probable connection with the sequence of events in the life of  Muhammad. Great attention has been paid to this subject by Dr. Weil in the  work just mentioned; by Mr. Muir in his Life of Mahomet, who also publishes a  chronological list of Suras, 21 however of which he admits have \"not yet been  carefully fixed;\" and especially by Nöldeke, in his Geschichte des Qôrans, a  work to which public honours were awarded in 1859 by the Paris Academy of  Inscriptions. From the arrangement of this author I see no reason to depart  in regard to the later Suras. It is based upon a searching criticism and  minute analysis of the component verses of each, and may be safely taken as a  standard, which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons. I  have, however, placed the earlier and more fragmentary Suras, after the two  first, in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than to  points of historical allusion, which in these Suras are very few; whilst on  the other hand, they are mainly couched in the language of self-communion, of  aspirations after truth, and of mental struggle, are vivid pictures of Heaven  and Hell, or descriptions of natural objects, and refer also largely to the  opposition met with by Muhammad from his townsmen of Mecca at the outset of  his public career. This remark applies to what Nöldeke terms \"the Suras of  the First Period.\"    The contrast between the earlier, middle, and later Suras is very striking  and interesting, and will be at once apparent from the arrangement here  adopted. In the Suras as far as the 54th, p. 76, we cannot but notice the  entire predominance of the poetical element, a deep appreciation (as in Sura  xci. p. 38) of the beauty of natural objects, brief fragmentary and  impassioned utterances, denunciations of woe and punishment, expressed for  the most part in lines of extreme brevity. With a change, however, in the  position of Muhammad when he openly assumes the office of \"public warner,\"  the Suras begin to assume a more prosaic and didactic tone, though the  poetical ornament of rhyme is preserved throughout. We gradually lose the  Poet in the missionary aiming to convert, the warm asserter of dogmatic  truths; the descriptions of natural objects, of the judgment, of Heaven and  Hell, make way for gradually increasing historical statements, first from  Jewish, and subsequently from Christian histories; while, in the 29 Suras  revealed at Medina, we no longer listen to vague words, often as it would  seem without positive aim, but to the earnest disputant with the enemies of  his faith, the Apostle pleading the cause of what he believes to be the Truth  of God. He who at Mecca is the admonisher and persuader, at Medina is the  legislator and the warrior, who dictates obedience, and uses other weapons  than the pen of the Poet and the Scribe. When business pressed, as at Medina,  Poetry makes way for Prose, and although touches of the Poetical element  occasionally break forth, and he has to defend himself up to a very late  period against the charge of being merely a Poet, yet this is rarely the case  in the Medina Suras; and we are startled by finding obedience to God and the  Apostle, God's gifts and the Apostle's, God's pleasure and the Apostle's,  spoken of in the same breath, and epithets and attributes elsewhere applied  to Allah openly applied to himself as in Sura ix., 118, 129.    The Suras, viewed as a whole, strike me as being the work of one who began  his career as a thoughtful enquirer after truth, and an earnest asserter of  it in such rhetorical and poetical forms as he deemed most likely to win and  attract his countrymen, and who gradually proceeded from the dogmatic teacher  to the politic founder of a system for which laws and regulations had to be  provided as occasions arose. And of all the Suras it must be remarked that  they were intended not for readers but for hearers-that they were all  promulgated by public recital-and that much was left, as the imperfect  sentences shew, to the manner and suggestive action of the reciter. It would  be impossible, and indeed it is unnecessary, to attempt a detailed life of  Muhammad within the narrow limits of a Preface. The main events thereof with  which the Suras of the Koran stand in connection, are-The visions of Gabriel,  seen, or said to have been seen, at the outset of his career in his 40th  year, during one of his seasons of annual monthly retirement, for devotion  and meditation to Mount Hirâ, near Mecca,-the period of mental depression and  re-assurance previous to the assumption of the office of public teacher-the  Fatrah or pause (see n. p. 20) during which he probably waited for a  repetition of the angelic vision-his labours in comparative privacy for three  years, issuing in about 40 converts, of whom his wife Chadijah was the first,  and Abu Bekr the most important: (for it is to him and to Abu Jahl the Sura  xcii. p. 32, refers)-struggles with Meccan unbelief and idolatry followed by  a period during which probably he had the second vision, Sura liii. p. 69,  and was listened to and respected as a person \"possessed\" (Sura lxix. 42, p.  60, lii. 29, p. 64)-the first emigration to Abyssinia in A.D. 616, in  consequence of the Meccan persecutions brought on by his now open attacks  upon idolatry (Taghout)-increasing reference to Jewish and Christian  histories, shewing that much time had been devoted to their study the  conversion of Omar in 617-the journey to the Thaquifites at Taief in A.D.  620-the intercourse with pilgrims from Medina, who believed in Islam, and  spread the knowledge thereof in their native town, in the same year-the  vision of the midnight journey to Jerusalem and the Heavens-the meetings by  night at Acaba, a mountain near Mecca, in the 11th year of his mission, and  the pledges of fealty there given to him-the command given to the believers  to emigrate to Yathrib, henceforth Medinat-en-nabi (the city of the Prophet)  or El-Medina (the city), in April of A.D. 622-the escape of Muhammad and Abu  Bekr from Mecca to the cave of Thaur-the FLIGHT to Medina in June 20, A.D.  622-treaties made with Christian tribes-increasing, but still very imperfect  acquaintance with Christian doctrines-the Battle of Bedr in Hej. 2, and of  Ohod-the coalition formed against Muhammad by the Jews and idolatrous  Arabians, issuing in the siege of Medina, Hej. 5 (A.D. 627)-the convention,  with reference to the liberty of making the pilgrimage, of Hudaibiya, Hej. 6-  the embassy to Chosroes King of Persia in the same year, to the Governor of  Egypt and to the King of Abyssinia, desiring them to embrace Islam-the  conquest of several Jewish tribes, the most important of which was that of  Chaibar in Hej. 7, a year marked by the embassy sent to Heraclius, then in  Syria, on his return from the Persian campaign, and by a solemn and peaceful  pilgrimage to Mecca-the triumphant entry into Mecca in Hej. 8 (A.D. 630), and  the demolition of the idols of the Caaba-the submission of the Christians of  Nedjran, of Aila on the Red Sea, and of Taief, etc., in Hej. 9, called \"the  year of embassies or deputations,\" from the numerous deputations which  flocked to Mecca proffering submission-and lastly in Hej. 10, the submission  of Hadramont, Yemen, the greater part of the southern and eastern provinces  of Arabia-and the final solemn pilgrimage to Mecca.    While, however, there is no great difficulty in ascertaining the Suras which  stand in connection with the more salient features of Muhammad's life, it is  a much more arduous, and often impracticable task, to point out the precise  events to which individual verses refer, and out of which they sprung. It is  quite possible that Muhammad himself, in a later period of his career,  designedly mixed up later with earlier revelations in the same Suras not for  the sake of producing that mysterious style which seems so pleasing to the  mind of those who value truth least when it is most clear and obvious but for  the purpose of softening down some of the earlier statements which represent  the last hour and awful judgment as imminent; and thus leading his followers  to continue still in the attitude of expectation, and to see in his later  successes the truth of his earlier predictions. If after-thoughts of this  kind are to be traced, and they will often strike the attentive reader, it  then follows that the perplexed state of the text in individual Suras is to  be considered as due to Muhammad himself, and we are furnished with a series  of constant hints for attaining to chronological accuracy. And it may be  remarked in passing, that a belief that the end of all things was at hand,  may have tended to promote the earlier successes of Islam at Mecca, as it  unquestionably was an argument with the Apostles, to flee from \"the wrath to  come.\" It must be borne in mind that the allusions to contemporary minor  events, and to the local efforts made by the new religion to gain the  ascendant are very few, and often couched in terms so vague and general, that  we are forced to interpret the Koran solely by the Koran itself. And for  this, the frequent repetitions of the same histories and the same sentiments,  afford much facility: and the peculiar manner in which the details of each  history are increased by fresh traits at each recurrence, enables us to trace  their growth in the author's mind, and to ascertain the manner in which a  part of the Koran was composed. The absence of the historical element from  the Koran as regards the details of Muhammad's daily life, may be"]]]
