Lee (#3)"],[1,",\"  and there we were met by a boat with two oarsmen, who rowed us down to  Sollers Point, where I was generally left under the care of the people  who lived there, while my father went over to the Fort, a short distance  out in the river. These days were happy ones for me. The wharves, the  shipping, the river, the boat and oarsmen, and the country dinner we had  at the house at Sollers Point, all made a strong impression on me;  but above all I remember my father, his gentle, loving care of me, his  bright talk, his stories, his maxims and teachings. I was very proud of  him and of the evident respect for and trust in him every one showed.  These impressions, obtained at that time, have never left me. He was  a great favourite in Baltimore, as he was everywhere, especially with  ladies and little children. When he and my mother went out in the  evening to some entertainment, we were often allowed to sit up and see  them off; my father, as I remember, always in full uniform, always ready  and waiting for my mother, who was generally late. He would chide her  gently, in a playful way and with a bright smile. He would then bid us  good-bye, and I would go to sleep with this beautiful picture in my  mind, the golden epaulets and all--chiefly the epaulets.    In Baltimore, I went to my first school, that of a Mr. Rollins on  Mulberry Street, and I remember how interested my father was in my  studies, my failures, and my little triumphs. Indeed, he was so always,  as long as I was at school and college, and I only wish that all of the  kind, sensible, useful letters he wrote me had been preserved.    My memory as to the move from Baltimore, which occurred in 1852, is very  dim. I think the family went to Arlington to remain until my father had  arranged for our removal to the new home at West Point.    My recollection of my father as Superintendent of the West Point  Military Academy is much more distinct. He lived in the house which is  still occupied by the Superintendent. It was built of stone, large and  roomy, with gardens, stables, and pasture lots. We, the two youngest  children, enjoyed it all. \"Grace Darling\" and \"Santa Anna\" were  there with us, and many a fine ride did I have with my father in the  afternoons, when, released from his office, he would mount his old mare  and, with Santa Anna carrying me by his side, take a five or ten-mile  trot. Though the pony cantered delightfully, he would make me keep him  in a trot, saying playfully that the hammering sustained was good for  me. We rode the dragoon-seat, no posting, and until I became accustomed  to it I used to be very tired by the time I got back.    My father was the most punctual man I ever knew. He was always ready for  family prayers, for meals, and met every engagement, social or business,  at the moment. He expected all of us to be the same, and taught us the  use and necessity of forming such habits for the convenience of all  concerned. I never knew him late for Sunday service at the Post Chapel.  He used to appear some minutes before the rest of us, in uniform,  jokingly rallying my mother for being late, and for forgetting something  at the last moment. When he could wait no longer for her, he would say  that he was off and would march along to church by himself, or with any  of the children who were ready. There he sat very straight--well up  the middle aisle--and, as I remember, always became very sleepy, and  sometimes even took a little nap during the sermon. At that time, this  drowsiness of my father's was something awful to me, inexplicable. I  know it was very hard for me to keep awake, and frequently I did not;  but why he, who to my mind could do everything right, without any  effort, should sometimes be overcome, I could not understand, and did  not try to do so.    It was against the rules that the cadets should go beyond certain limits  without permission. Of course they did go sometimes, and when caught  were given quite a number of \"demerits.\" My father was riding out one  afternoon with me, and, while rounding a turn in the mountain road with  a deep woody ravine on one side, we came suddenly upon three cadets far  beyond the limits. They immediately leaped over a low wall on the side  of the road and disappeared from our view.    We rode on for a minute in silence; then my father said: \"Did you know  those young men? But no; if you did, don't say so. I wish boys would do  what was right, it would be so much easier for all parties!\"    He knew he would have to report them, but, not being sure of who they  were, I presume he wished to give them the benefit of the doubt. At any  rate, I never heard any more about it. One of the three asked me the  next day if my father had recognised them, and I told him what had  occurred.    By this time I had become old enough to have a room to myself, and, to  encourage me in being useful and practical, my father made me attend to  it, just as the cadets had to do with their quarters in barracks and in  camp. He at first even went through the form of inspecting it, to see if  I had performed my duty properly, and I think I enjoyed this until  the novelty wore off. However, I was kept at it, becoming in time very  proficient, and the knowledge so acquired has been of great use to me  all through life.    My father always encouraged me in every healthy outdoor exercise and  sport. He taught me to ride, constantly giving me minute instructions,  with the reasons for them. He gave me my first sled, and sometimes used  to come out where we boys were coasting to look on. He gave me my first  pair of skates, and placed me in the care of a trustworthy person,  inquiring regularly how I progressed. It was the same with swimming,  which he was very anxious I should learn in a proper manner. Professor  Bailey had a son about my age, now himself a professor at Brown  University, Providence, Rhode Island, who became my great chum. I  took my first lesson in the water with him, under the direction and  supervision of his father. My father inquired constantly how I was  getting along, and made me describe exactly my method and stroke,  explaining to me what he considered the best way to swim, and the  reasons therefor.    I went to day-school at West Point, and had always a sympathetic helper  in my father; often he would come into the room where I studied at  night, and, sitting down by me, would show me how to overcome a hard  sentence in my Latin reader or a difficult sum in arithmetic, not by  giving me the translation of the troublesome sentence or the answer  to the sum, but by showing me, step by step, the way to the right  solutions. He was very patient, very loving, very good to me, and I  remember trying my best to please him in my studies. When I was able to  bring home a good report from my teacher, he was greatly pleased, and  showed it in his eye and voice, but he always insisted that I should  get the \"maximum,\" that he would never be perfectly satisfied with less.  That I did sometimes win it, deservedly, I know was due to his judicious  and wise method of exciting my ambition and perseverance. I have  endeavoured to show how fond my father was of his children, and as the  best picture I can offer of his loving, tender devotion to us all,  I give here a letter from him written about this time to one of  his daughters who was staying with our grandmother, Mrs. Custis, at  Arlington:    \"West Point, February 25, 1853    \"My Precious Annie: I take advantage of your gracious permission to  write to you, and there is no telling how far my feelings might carry  men were I not limited by the conveyance furnished by the Mim's [His pet  name for my mother] letter, which lies before me, and which must, the  Mim says so, go in this morning's mail. But my limited time does not  diminish my affection for you, Annie, nor prevent my thinking of you and  wishing for you. I long to see you through the dilatory nights. At dawn  when I rise, and all day, my thoughts revert to you in expressions that  you cannot hear or I repeat. I hope you will always appear to me as you  are now painted on my heart, and that you will endeavor to improve and  so conduct yourself as to make you happy and me joyful all our lives.  Diligent and earnest attention to ALL your duties can only accomplish  this. I am told you are growing very tall, and I hope very straight. I  do not know what the Cadets will say if the Superintendent's CHILDREN  do not practice what he demands of them. They will naturally say he had  better attend to his own before he corrects other people's children, and  as he permits his to stoop it is hard he will not allow them. You and  Agnes [His third daughter] must not, therefore, bring me into discredit  with my young friends, or give them reason to think that I require more  of them than of my own. I presume your mother has told all about us, our  neighbors, and our affairs. And indeed she may have done that and not  said much either, so far as I know. But we are all well and have much to  be grateful for. To-morrow we anticipate the pleasure of your brother's  [His son, Custis] company, which is always a source of pleasure to us.  It is the only time we see him, except when the Corps come under my view  at some of their exercises, when my eye is sure to distinguish him among  his comrades and follow him over the plain. Give much love to your dear  grandmother, grandfather, Agnes, Miss Sue, Lucretia, and all friends,  including the servants. Write sometimes, and think always of your  Affectionate father, R. E. Lee.\"    In a letter to my mother written many years previous to this time, he  says:    \"I pray God to watch over and direct our efforts in guarding our dear  little son....Oh, what pleasure I lose in being separated from my  children! Nothing can compensate me for that....\"    In another letter of about the same time:    \"You do not know how much I have missed you and the children, my dear "]]]
