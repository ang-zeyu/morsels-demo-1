[Illustration: Complete Morris Chair Without Cushion]    [Illustration: Details of a Morris Chair]    At the rear ends of the arms are the notched pieces that allow the back  to be adjusted to different angles. These pieces may be fastened in  place either by means of roundhead screws from above or flatheads from  underneath the arms. The notches are to be cut 3/4 in. deep. If more  than three adjustments are wanted, the arms must be made correspondingly  longer.    The dimensions for the tenons on all the larger pieces will be found on  the drawing. For the back, the tenons of the cross pieces, the rails,  should be 3/8 by 1-1/4-in. For the slats, the easiest way is to not  tenon them but to \"let in\" the whole end, making the mortises in the  rails 3/8 by 1-1/2 in. This will necessitate cutting the sides of the  mortises very accurately, but this extra care will be more than  compensated by not having to bother with the cutting of tenons on each  end of the three back slats.    To finish the chair, put on a coat of water stain, first removing all  surplus glue and thoroughly scraping and sandpapering all the parts that  were not so treated at the mill. The color of the stain will depend upon  the finish desired, whether golden, mission, etc. Water stains cause the  grain of the wood to roughen, so it will be necessary to resandpaper the  surfaces after the stain has dried, using fine paper. Next apply a coat  of filler colored to match the stain. Directions for its application  will be found upon the cans in which the filler comes. After the filler  has hardened put on a very thin coat of shellac.    What step is taken next will depend upon what kind of a surface is  desired. Several coats of polishing wax may be put on. This is easily  done--directions will be found on the cans--and makes the most  satisfactory finish for mission and craftsman furniture. It is the  easiest to apply. Several coats of shellac or of varnish might be put on  instead of wax. Each coat of the shellac should be rubbed when  thoroughly dried with curled hair or fine steel wool or fine oiled  sandpaper. Rub the first coats of varnish with hair-cloth or curled hair  and the last coats with pulverized pumice stone and crude oil or raw  linseed oil.    Cushions for the chair can be made at home. They may be made of art  leather such as Spanish roan skin and the top and bottom parts fastened  together by lacing leather thongs through holes previously punched along  the edges of the parts. A very pretty effect is obtained by using thongs  of a different but harmonious color. The manner of lacing may be any one  of the various laces such as are used in lacing belts or as shoestrings.  These cushions may be filled with hair or cotton felt. Denim or burlap  may also be used as a covering and are much less expensive than the  leather. Lace one side and the two ends, then place filling and finish  lacing.    Art leather cushions retail at from $16 to $20 a pair and the denim and  burlap at $6 to $9.    The bottom cushion should be made the full size of the chair. The front  and back rails extend a little above the slats and thus hold it in  place. The back cushion will settle down a little and therefore may be  made nearly the full length from the slats to the top of the back.          HOME-MADE MISSION BOOK RACK      [Illustration: Light but Strong]    When making the book rack as shown in the accompanying photograph use  quarter-sawed oak if possible, as this wood is the most suitable for  finishing in the different mission stains. This piece of furniture is  very attractive and simple to construct. The upper shelf can be used  for vases or a plant of some kind, while the lower shelves afford ample  room for books and magazines.    The slats and legs are fastened to the shelves with 2-in. round-headed  brass screws. These can be purchased from any hardware store. One screw  is used at each joint of a slat and shelf which calls for 32 screws in  all. Holes should be bored into the slats and legs in which to insert  the screws. This will keep the wood from splitting. The dimensions are  given in the diagram sketch, although these may be changed to suit the  requirement of the builder. If no glue is used on the joints when  setting up, the rack can easily be taken apart and put in a small bundle  for moving.    [Illustration: Details of Stand]          HOW TO MAKE A MISSION LIBRARY TABLE      The mission library table, the drawings for which are here given, has  been found well proportioned and of pleasing appearance. It can be made  of any of the several furniture woods in common use, such as selected,  quarter-sawed white oak which will be found exceptionally pleasing in  the effect produced.    [Illustration: This Picture is from a Photograph of the Mission Table  Described in This Article]    If a planing mill is at hand the stock can be ordered in such a way as  to avoid the hard work of planing and sandpapering. Of course if  mill-planed stock cannot be had, the following dimensions must be  enlarged slightly to allow for \"squaring up the rough.\"    [Illustration: Showing Dimensions of Table]    For the top, order 1 piece 1-1/8 in. thick, 34 in. wide and 46 in. long.  Have it S-4-S (surface on four sides) and \"squared\" to length. Also  specify that it be sandpapered on the top surface, the edges and ends.    For the shelf, order 1 piece 7/8 in. thick, 22 in. wide and 42 in. long,  with the four sides surfaced, squared and sandpapered the same as for  the top.    For the side rails, order 2 pieces 7/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and 37 in.  long, S-4-S and sanded on one side. For the end rails, 2 pieces 7/8 in.  thick, 6 in. wide and 25 in. long. Other specifications as for the side  rails.    For the stretchers, into which the shelf tenons enter, 2 pieces 1-1/8  in. thick, 3-3/4 in. wide and 25 in. long, surfaced and sanded on four  sides. For the slats, 10 pieces 5/8 in. thick, 1-1/2 in. wide and 17 in.  long, surfaced and sanded on four sides. For the keys, 4 pieces 3/4 in.  thick, 1-1/4 in. wide and 2-7/8 in. long, S-4-S. This width is a little  wide; it will allow the key to be shaped as desired.    The drawings obviate any necessity for going into detail in the  description. Fig. 1 gives an assembly drawing showing the relation of  the parts. Fig. 2 gives the detail of an end. The tenons for the side  rails are laid off and the mortises placed in the post as are those on  the end. Care must be taken, however, not to cut any mortises on the  post below, as was done in cutting the stretcher mortises on the ends of  the table. A good plan is to set the posts upright in the positions they  are to occupy relative to one another and mark with pencil the  approximate positions of the mortises. The legs can then be laid flat  and the mortises accurately marked out with a fair degree of assurance  that they will not be cut where they are not wanted and that the legs  shall \"pair\" properly when effort is made to assemble the parts of the  table.    [Illustration: Details of Table Construction]    The table ends should be glued up first and the glue allowed to harden,  after which the tenons of the shelf may be inserted and the side rails  placed.    There is a reason for the shape, size and location of each tenon or  mortise. For illustration, the shape of the tenon on the top rails  permits the surface of the rail to extend almost flush with the surface  of the post at the same time permitting the mortise in the post to be  kept away from that surface. Again, the shape of the ends of the slats  is such that, though they may vary slightly in length, the fitting of  the joints will not be affected. Care must be taken in cutting the  mortises to keep their sides clean and sharp and to size.    In making the mortises for the keyed tenons, the length of mortise must  be slightly in excess of the width of the tenon--about 1/8 in. of play  to each side of each tenon. With a shelf of the width specified for this  table, if such allowance is not made so that the tenons may move  sideways, the shrinkage would split the shelf.    In cutting across the ends of the shelf, between the tenons, leave a  hole in the waste so that the turning saw or compass saw can be  inserted. Saw within one-sixteenth of the line, after which this margin  may be removed with chisel and mallet.    In Fig. 3 is shown two views of the keyed tenon and the key. The mortise  for the key is to be placed in the middle of the tenon. It will be noted  that this mortise is laid out 1-1/16 in. from the shoulder of the tenon  while the stretcher is 1-1/8 in. thick. This is to insure the key's  pulling the shelf tightly against the side of the stretcher.    Keys may be made in a variety of shapes. The one shown is simple and  structurally good. Whatever shape is used, the important thing to keep  in mind is that the size of the key and the slant of its forward surface  where it passes through the tenon must be kept the same as the mortise  made for it in the tenon.    The top is to be fastened to the rails by means either of wooden  buttons, Fig. 4, or small angle irons.    There are a bewildering number of mission finishes upon the market. A  very satisfactory one is obtained by applying a coat of brown Flemish  water stain, diluted by the addition of water in the proportion of two  parts water to 1 part stain. When this has dried, sand with No. 00  paper, being careful not to \"cut through.\" Next, apply a coat of dark  brown filler; the directions for doing this will be found upon the can  in which the filler is bought. One coat usually suffices. However, if an  especially smooth surface is desired, a second coat may be applied in a  similar manner.    After the filler has hardened, a very thin coat of shellac is to be put  on. When this has dried, it should be sanded lightly and then one or two  coats of wax should be properly applied and polished.

The Chicago Orchestra, in eight seasons under  Theodore Thomas, devoted, out of a total of 925 numbers, only  eighteen, or something less than two per cent., to native music. Yet  time shows a gradual improvement, and in 1899, out of twenty-seven  orchestral numbers performed, three were by Americans, which makes a  liberal tithe. The Boston Symphony has played the compositions of John  Knowles Paine alone more than eighteen times, and those of George W.  Chadwick the same number, while E.A. MacDowell and Arthur Foote each  appeared on the programs fourteen times. The Kaltenborn Orchestra has  made an active effort at the promulgation of our music, and especial  honor is due to Frank Van der Stucken, himself a composer of marked  abilities; he was among the first to give orchestral production to  American works, and he was, perhaps, the very first to introduce  American orchestral work abroad. Like his offices, in spirit and  effect, have been the invaluable services of our most eminent pianist,  Wm. H. Sherwood, who was for many years the only prominent performer  of American piano compositions.    Public singers also have been most unpatriotic in preferring endless  repetition of dry foreign arias to fresh compositions from home. The  little encore song, which generally appeared anonymously, was the  opening wedge for the American lyrist.    Upon the horizon of this gloom, however, there is a tremor of a  dawning interest in national music. Large vocal societies are giving  an increasing number of native part songs and cantatas; prizes are  being awarded in various places, and composers find some financial  encouragement for appearing in concerts of their own work. Manuscript  societies are organized in many of the larger cities, and these clubs  offer hearing to novelty. There have latterly appeared, from various  publishers, special catalogues vaunting the large number of American  composers represented on their lists.    Another, and a most important sign of the growing influence of music  upon American life, is seen in the place it is gaining in the college  curriculum; new chairs have been established, and prominent composers  called to fill them, or old professorships that held merely nominal  places in the catalogue have been enlarged in scope. In this way music  is reestablishing itself in something like its ancient glory; for the  Greeks not only grouped all culture under the general term of  \"Music,\" but gave voice and instrument a vital place in education.  Three of our most prominent composers fill the chairs at three of the  most important universities. In all these cases, however, music is an  elective study, while the rudiments of the art should, I am convinced,  be a required study in every college curriculum, and in the common  schools as well.    Assuming then, for the nonce, the birth--we are too new a country to  speak of a Renascence--of a large interest in national music, there is  large disappointment in many quarters, because our American music is  not more American. I have argued above that a race transplanted from  other soils must still retain most of the old modes of expression, or,  varying them, change slowly. But many who excuse us for the present  lack of a natural nationalism, are so eager for such a differentiation  that they would have us borrow what we cannot breed.    The folk-music of the negro slaves is most frequently mentioned as the  right foundation for a strictly American school. A somewhat  misunderstood statement advanced by Dr. Antonin Dvorak, brought this  idea into general prominence, though it had been discussed by American  composers, and made use of in compositions of all grades long before  he came here.    The vital objection, however, to the general adoption of negro music  as a base for an American school of composition is that it is in no  sense a national expression. It is not even a sectional expression,  for the white Southerners among whose slaves this music grew, as well  as the people of the North, have always looked upon negro music as an  exotic and curious thing. Familiar as it is to us, it is yet as  foreign a music as any Tyrolean jodel or Hungarian czardas.    The music of the American Indian, often strangely beautiful and  impressive, would be as reasonably chosen as that of these imported  Africs. E.A. MacDowell had, indeed, written a picturesque and  impressive Indian suite, some time before the Dvorakian invasion. He  asserts that the Indian music is preferable to the Ethiopian, because  its sturdiness and force are more congenial with the national mood.    But the true hope for a national spirit in American music surely lies,  not in the arbitrary seizure of some musical dialect, but in the  development of just such a quality as gives us an individuality among  the nations of the world in respect to our character as a people; and  that is a Cosmopolitanism made up of elements from all the world, and  yet, in its unified qualities, unlike any one element. Thus our music  should, and undoubtedly will, be the gathering into the spirit of the  voices of all the nations, and the use of all their expressions in an  assimilated, a personal, a spontaneous manner. This need not, by any  means, be a dry, academic eclecticism. The Yankee, a composite of all  peoples, yet differs from them all, and owns a sturdy individuality.  His music must follow the same fate.    As our governmental theories are the outgrowth of the experiments and  experiences of all previous history, why should not our music, voicing  as it must the passions of a cosmopolitan people, use cosmopolitan  expressions? The main thing is the individuality of each artist. To be  a citizen of the world, provided one is yet spontaneous and sincere  and original, is the best thing. The whole is greater than any of its  parts.    Along just these lines of individualized cosmopolitanism the American  school is working out its identity. Some of our composers have shown  themselves the heirs of European lore by work of true excellence in  the larger classic and romantic forms.    The complaint might be made, indeed, that the empty, incorrect period  of previous American music has given place to too much correctness and  too close formation on the old models. This is undoubtedly the result  of the long and faithful discipleship under German methods, and need  not be made much of in view of the tendency among a few masters toward  original expression. For, after all, even in the heyday of the  greatest art periods, only a handful of artists have ever stood out as  strongly individual; the rest have done good work as faithful  imitators and past masters in technic. It is, then, fortunate that  there is any tendency at all among any of our composers to forsake  academic content with classical forms and text-book development of  ideas.    Two things, however, are matters for very serious disappointment: the  surprising paucity of musical composition displaying the national  sense of humor, and the surprising abundance of purest namby-pamby.  The presence of the latter class might be explained by the absence of  the former, for namby-pamby cannot exist along with a healthy sense  of the ludicrous. There has been a persistent craze among native  song-writers for little flower-dramas and bird-tragedies, which,  aiming at exquisiteness, fall far short of that dangerous goal and  land in flagrant silliness. This weakness, however, will surely  disappear in time, or at least diminish, until it holds no more  prominent place than it does in all the foreign schools, where it  exists to a certain extent.    The scherzo, however, must grow in favor. It is impossible that the  most jocose of races, a nation that has given the world an original  school of humor, should not carry this spirit over into its music. And  yet almost none of the comparatively few scherzos that have been  written here have had any sense of the hilarious jollity that makes  Beethoven's wit side-shaking. They have been rather of the Chopinesque  sort, mere fantasy. To the composers deserving this generalization I  recall only two important exceptions, Edgar S. Kelley and Harvey  Worthington Loomis.    The opportunities before the American composer are enormous, and only  half appreciated. Whereas, in other arts, the text-book claims only to  be a chronicle of what has been done before, in music the text-book is  set up as the very gospel and decalogue of the art. The theorists have  so thoroughly mapped out the legitimate resources of the composer, and  have so prescribed his course in nearly every possible position, that  music is made almost more of a mathematical problem than the free  expression of emotions and aesthetics. \"Correct\" music has now hardly  more liberty than Egyptian sculpture or Byzantine painting once had.  Certain dissonances are permitted, and certain others, no more  dissonant, forbidden, quite arbitrarily, or on hair-splitting  theories. It is as if one should write down in a book a number of  charts, giving every scheme of color and every juxtaposition of values  permissible to a painter. The music of certain Oriental nations, in  which the religious orders are the art censors, has stuck fast in its  rut because of the observance of rules purely arbitrary. Many of the  conventions of modern European music are no more scientific or  original or consistent; most of them are based upon the principle that  the whim of a great dead composer is worthy to be the law of any  living composer. These Blue Laws of music are constantly assailed  surreptitiously and in detail; and yet they are too little attacked as  a whole. But music should be a democracy and not an aristocracy, or,  still less, a hierarchy.    There is a great opportunity for America to carry its political"]]]
