In contradistinction to this, the essentially underground liquids, with  time and pressure, form metallic minerals and mineralise the rocks,  instead of forming gems.    Thus we see that in a different class of minerals--compounds of metals  with the sulphates, such as sulphuric acid and compounds; also those  containing the metallic sulphides; in cases where the metalliferous ores  or the metallic elements enter into composition with the  halogens--bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine--in all these,  precious stones are comparatively common, but the stones of these groups  are invariably those used for decorative or ornamental purposes, and  true \"gems\" are entirely absent.    It would therefore appear that though metallic minerals, as already  mentioned, are formed by the action of essentially _underground_  chemically-charged water--combined with ages of time and long-continued  pressure, rocks and earth being transformed into metalliferous ores by  the same means--precious stones (or that portion of them ranking as  jewels or gems) must on the contrary be wholly, or almost wholly,  composed of _upper_-earth-crust materials, carried deep down by water,  and subjected to the action of the same time and pressure; the simpler  the compound, the more perfect and important the result, as seen in the  diamond, the ruby, and the like.          CHAPTER III.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      A--CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE.    Before proceeding to the study of precious stones as individual gems,  certain physical properties common to all must be discussed, in order to  bring the gems into separate classes, not only because of some chemical  uniformity, but also because of the unity which exists between their  physical formation and properties.    The first consideration, therefore, may advisedly be that of their  crystals, since their crystalline structure forms a ready means for the  classification of stones, and indeed for that of a multitudinous variety  of substances.    It is one of the many marvellous phenomena of nature that mineral, as  well as many vegetable and animal substances, on entering into a state  of solidity, take upon themselves a definite form called a crystal.  These crystals build themselves round an axis or axes with wonderful  regularity, and it has been found, speaking broadly, that the same  substance gives the same crystal, no matter how its character may be  altered by colour or other means. Even when mixed with other  crystallisable substances, the resulting crystals may partake of the two  varieties and become a sort of composite, yet to the physicist they are  read like an open book, and when separated by analysis they at once  revert to their original form. On this property the analyst depends  largely for his results, for in such matters as food adulteration, etc.,  the microscope unerringly reveals impurities by means of the crystals  alone, apart from other evidences.    It is most curious, too, to note that no matter how large a crystal may  be, when reduced even to small size it will be found that the crystals  are still of the same shape. If this process is taken still further, and  the substance is ground to the finest impalpable powder, as fine as  floating dust, when placed under the microscope each speck, though  perhaps invisible to the naked eye, will be seen a perfect crystal, of  the identical shape as that from which it came, one so large maybe that  its planes and angles might have been measured and defined by rule and  compass. This shows how impossible it is to alter the shape of a  crystal. We may dissolve it, pour the solution into any shaped vessel or  mould we desire, recrystallise it and obtain a solid sphere, triangle,  square, or any other form; it is also possible, in many cases, to  squeeze the crystal by pressure into a tablet, or any form we choose,  but in each case we have merely altered the _arrangement_ of the  crystals, so as to produce a differently shaped _mass_, the crystals  themselves remaining individually as before. Such can be said to be one  of the laws of crystals, and as it is found that every substance has its  own form of crystal, a science, or branch of mineralogy, has arisen,  called \"crystallography,\" and out of the conglomeration of confused  forms there have been evolved certain rules of comparison by which all  known crystals may be classed in certain groups.    This is not so laborious a matter as would appear, for if we take a  substance which crystallises in a cube we find it is possible to draw  nine symmetrical planes, these being called \"planes of symmetry,\" the  intersections of one or more of which planes being called \"axes of  symmetry.\" So that in the nine planes of symmetry of the cube we get  three axes, each running through to the opposite side of the cube. One  will be through the centre of a face to the opposite face; a second will  be through the centre of one edge diagonally; the third will be found in  a line running diagonally from one point to its opposite. On turning the  cube on these three axes--as, for example, a long needle running through  a cube of soap--we shall find that four of the six identical faces of  the cube are exposed to view during each revolution of the cube on the  needle or axis.    These faces are not necessarily, or always, planes, or flat, strictly  speaking, but are often more or less curved, according to the shape of  the crystal, taking certain characteristic forms, such as the square,  various forms of triangles, the rectangle, etc., and though the crystals  may be a combination of several forms, all the faces of any particular  form are similar.    All the crystals at present known exhibit differences in their planes,  axes and lines of symmetry, and on careful comparison many of them are  found to have some features in common; so that when they are sorted out  it is seen that they are capable of being classified into thirty-three  groups. Many of these groups are analogous, so that on analysing them  still further we find that all the known crystals may be classed in six  separate systems according to their planes of symmetry, and all stones  of the same class, no matter what their variety or complexity may be,  show forms of the same group. Beginning with the highest, we have--(1)  the cubic system, with nine planes of symmetry; (2) the hexagonal, with  seven planes; (3) the tetragonal, with five planes; (4) the rhombic,  with three planes; (5) the monoclinic, with one plane; (6) the  triclinic, with no plane of symmetry at all.    In the first, the cubic--called also the isometric, monometric, or  regular--there are, as we have seen, three axes, all at right angles,  all of them being equal.    The second, the hexagonal system--called also the rhombohedral--is  different from the others in having four axes, three of them equal and  in one plane and all at 120 deg. to each other; the fourth axis is not  always equal to these three. It may be, and often is, longer or shorter.  It passes through the intersecting point of the three others, and is  perpendicular or at right angles to them.    The third of the six systems enumerated above, the tetragonal--or the  quadratic, square prismatic, dimetric, or pyramidal--system has three  axes like the cubic, but, in this case, though they are all at right  angles, two only of them are equal, the third, consequently, unequal.  The vertical or principal axis is often much longer or shorter in this  group, but the other two are always equal and lie in the horizontal  plane, at right angles to each other, and at right angles to the  vertical axis.    The fourth system, the rhombic--or orthorhombic, or prismatic, or  trimetric--has, like the tetragonal, three axes; but in this case, none  of them are equal, though the two lateral axes are at right angles to  each other, and to the vertical axis, which may vary in length, more so  even than the other two.    The fifth, the monoclinic--or clinorhombic, monosymmetric, or  oblique--system, has also three axes, all of them unequal. The two  lateral axes are at right angles to each other, but the principal or  vertical axis, which passes through the point of intersection of the two  lateral axes, is only at right angles to one of them.    In the sixth and last system, the triclinic--or anorthic, or  asymmetric--the axes are again three, but in this case, none of them are  equal and none at right angles.    It is difficult to explain these various systems without drawings, and  the foregoing may seem unnecessarily technical. It is, however,  essential that these particulars should be clearly stated in order  thoroughly to understand how stones, especially uncut stones, are  classified. These various groups must also be referred to when dealing  with the action of light and other matters, for in one or other of them  most stones are placed, notwithstanding great differences in hue and  character; thus all stones exhibiting the same crystalline structure as  the diamond are placed in the same group. Further, when the methods of  testing come to be dealt with, it will be seen that these particulars of  grouping form a certain means of testing stones and of distinguishing  spurious from real. For if a stone is offered as a real gem (the true  stone being known to lie in the highest or cubic system), it follows  that should examination prove the stone to be in the sixth system, then,  no matter how coloured or cut, no matter how perfect the imitation, the  test of its crystalline structure stamps it readily as false beyond all  shadow of doubt--for as we have seen, no human means have as yet been  forthcoming by which the crystals can be changed in form, only in  arrangement, for a diamond crystal _is_ a diamond crystal, be it in a  large mass, like the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#3)"],[1,"School for Girls\"  had been set for the following Monday.    It was now Friday afternoon. Marjorie had spent the morning in writing a  fifteen-page letter to Mary, the minor refrain of which was: \"I can't  tell you how much I miss you, Mary,\" and which contained views regarding  her future high school career that were far from being optimistic. She  had not finished her letter. She decided to leave it open until after  luncheon and, laying it aside for the time, she had tripped down stairs  and out doors.    \"What are you going to do this afternoon, dear?\" asked her mother as  Marjorie slipped into place at the luncheon table.    \"I don't know, Mother,\" was the almost doleful reply. \"I thought I might  take a walk up Orchard street as far as Sargent's, that cunning little  confectioner's shop on the corner. Perhaps, if I go, I may see something  interesting to tell Mary. I haven't finished my letter.\"    Marjorie did not add that her walk would include a last stroll past the  towering gray walls of a certain stone building on Lincoln avenue, which  bore over its massive oak doors the inscription, \"The Sanford High  School for Girls.\" Almost every day since her arrival, she had visited  it, viewing it speculatively and with a curious kind of apprehension.  She was not afraid to plunge into her new school life, but deep down in  her heart she felt some little misgiving. What if the new girls proved  to be neither likable nor companionable? What if she liked them but they  did not like her? She had just begun the same apprehensive train of  thought that had been disturbing her peace of mind for the last four  days when her mother's voice broke the spell.    \"If you are going that far I wish you would go on to Parke & Whitfield's  for me. I should like you to match this embroidery silk. I have not  enough of it to finish this collar and cuff set I am making for you.\"    \"I'll be your faithful servant and execute all your commissions, mum,\"  declared Marjorie with a little obeisance, her spirits rising a little  at the prospect of actual errands to perform. She was already tired of  aimlessly wandering along the wide, well-kept streets of Sanford,  feeling herself to be quite out of things. Even errands were actual  blessings sometimes, she decided, as a little later, she ran upstairs to  dress.    \"May I wear my best suit and hat, Mother?\" she called anxiously down  from the head of the stairs. \"It's such a lovely day, I'm sure it won't  rain, snow, hail or do anything else to spoil them.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Mrs. Dean, placidly.    With a gurgle of delight Marjorie hurried into her room to put on her  new brown suit, which had the mark of a well-known tailor in the coat,  and her best hat, on which all the Franklin High girls had set their  seal of approval. She had shoes and gloves to match her suit, too, and  her dancing brown eyes and fluffy brown hair were the last touches  needed to complete the dainty little study in brown.    \"Don't I look nice in this suit?\" she asked her mother saucily, turning  slowly around before the living-room mirror. \"Aren't you and father  perfect dears to let me have it, though?\" She whirled and descended upon  her mother with outstretched arms, enveloping her in an ecstatic hug  that sadly disturbed the proper angle of her brown velvet hat.    \"Don't be gone too long,\" reminded her mother. \"You know father has  promised us tickets for the theatre to-night. We shall have an early  dinner.\"    \"All right, I'll remember, Captain.\" With a brisk touching of her hand  to her hat brim in salute Marjorie vanished through the door, to  reappear a moment later at the living-room window, flash a merry smile  at her mother, about face and march down the walk in true military  style.    Long before when Marjorie was a tiny girl she had shown an unusual  preference for soldiers. She had owned enough wooden soldiers to make a  regiment and was never at a loss to invent war games in which they  figured. Sometimes, when she tired of her stiff, silent armies, which  could only move as she willed, she inveigled her father or mother into  being the hero, the enemy, the traitor or whatever her active  imagination chose to suggest. Her parents, amused at her boyish love of  military things, encouraged her in her play and entered into it with as  much spirit as the child herself. Her father, who had once been an  officer in the National Guard, taught her the manual of arms and she had  learned it with a will.    Marjorie's military enthusiasm had been at its height when she met Mary  Raymond, who soon became equally fascinated with the stirring play. In  time other interests crowded their lives. The hard-worked armies were  laid peacefully on their wooden backs to enjoy a long, undisturbed rest,  while Marjorie and Mary became soldiers instead, addressing Mr. Dean as  \"General,\" Mrs. Dean as \"Captain,\" and bestowing upon themselves the  rank of ordinary enlisted soldiers who must earn their promotion by  loyal and faithful service.    Mr. Dean had been rather chary of promotions, frequently reminding his  little detachment that it is a far cry from the ranks of a private to  that of a commissioned officer. So when their parting came, Mary and  Marjorie had just received their commissions as second lieutenants,  their awards of faithful service in the grammar school.    Lieutenant Marjorie smiled, then sighed, as she started on her walk. The  salute she had just given brought a flood of memories of Mary. She felt  she would not mind exploring this strange, new, high school territory if  Mary were with her. She was sure no girl in Sanford could understand her  as Mary had. On two different afternoons she had stood across the street  from the school at the time of dismissal. She had eagerly watched the  great oak doors open wide and the long lines of girls file out, waking  the still October air with their merry voices. She had been particularly  attracted toward one tall, lithe, graceful girl whose golden hair and  brown eyes made her unusually lovely. At first sight of her, lonely,  imaginative Marjorie had named her \"The Picture Girl,\" and had decided  that she was a darling. She had noticed that the pretty girl was always  the center of a group and she had also noted that one small,  black-haired girl with an elfish face, who wore the most exquisite  clothes invariably walked at the tall girl's side. There was a  pink-cheeked girl, too, with laughing blue eyes and dimples, and a  fair-haired, serious-faced girl, who reminded Marjorie of Alice Duval.  They usually formed part of the group about the tall girl and her dark  companion, and there was also a very short, stout girl who puffed along  anxiously in the rear of the group as though never quite able to catch  up.    Marjorie had already imagined much concerning this particular knot of  girls, and her desire to see them again before entering school was  responsible for her walk down Lincoln avenue that sunny fall afternoon.  She would do her errands first, she decided, then, returning by the way  of the school, pass there just at the time that the afternoon session  was dismissed. She went about her far-from-arduous commissions in  leisurely fashion, now and then glancing at her chatelaine watch to make  sure of the time. Three o'clock saw the daily procession of girls down  the high school steps, and released from classes for the day. She did  not intend to miss them.    It was twenty minutes to three when Marjorie finished a remarkable  concoction of nuts, chocolate syrup and ice cream, a kind of glorified  nut sundae, rejoicing in the name of \"Sargent Nectar,\" and left the  smart little confectioner's shop. As she neared the school building her  eyes suddenly became riveted upon a slim, blue-clad figure that  hesitated for on instant at the top of the high steps then ran lightly  down and came hurrying toward where she stood.    \"The advance guard,\" declared Marjorie half aloud. Then, as her eyes  sought the approaching girl: \"Why, she looks like Mary! And she's been  crying! I'm going to speak to her.\" She took an impulsive step forward  as the stranger came abreast of her and began:    \"Won't you----\"    Marjorie's speech ended abruptly. The weeping girl cast one startled  glance toward her from a pair of wet blue eyes, lunged by her without  speaking and, breaking into a run, turned the corner and disappeared  from view. Marjorie surveyed the back of the rapidly vanishing yellow  head with rueful surprise. Then she gave a short laugh.    \"I should have known better,\" she reflected. \"Of course, she'd hardly  care to tell her personal affairs to the first one who asks her. But she  made me think of Mary. Oh, dear, I'm so homesick. Not even my new suit  and hat can make me forget that. I wouldn't have mother know it for the  world. I believe she is a wee bit homesick, too.\"    Marjorie paused for an instant at her accustomed place on the opposite  side of the street, undecided whether to loiter there and once more  watch her future companions pass out of school or to go on about her  business. Suddenly the school doors swung wide and the pupils began  flocking out. The little stranger yielded to the temptation to linger  long enough to watch the five girls pass in whom she had become  interested. They were among the last to emerge and, the moment they  reached the steps, their voices rose in a confused babble, each one  determined to make herself heard above the others.    \"I knew she wouldn't do it,\" shrilled the stout girl, as they neared  Marjorie. \"She's too stingy for words. That's the third time she's  refused to go into things with the rest of us.\"    \"Be still,\" reminded the Picture Girl; \"she might have very good  reasons----\"    \"Good reasons,\" scornfully mimicked the little dark girl, her black eyes  glittering angrily. \"It was only because the plan was mine. She hates  me, and you all know why. I don't think you ought to"]]]
