Fiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending  months for a country's accounting period of 12 months, which  often is the calendar year but which may begin in any month.  FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar  year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994. All yearly  references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated  as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).    Flag description: This entry provides a written flag  description produced from actual flags or the best  information available at the time the entry was written. The  flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some  disputed and other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color  flag at the beginning of the country profile. The flag  graphics were produced from actual flags or the best  information available at the time of preparation. The flags  of independent states are used by their dependencies unless  there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed  and other areas do not have flags.    GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or  value of all final goods and services produced within a  nation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates in the Factbook  are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.  See the note on GDP methodology for more information.    GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar  estimates for all countries are derived from purchasing  power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions  at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves  the use of standardized international dollar price weights,  which are applied to the quantities of final goods and  services produced in a given economy. The data derived from  the PPP method provide the best available starting point for  comparisons of economic strength and well-being between  countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic  currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives  the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing  countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP  estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers  published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP)  and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the  University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In  contrast, currency exchange rates depend on a variety of  international and domestic financial forces that often have  little relation to domestic output. In developing countries  with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in  dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP  estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or  down by 10% or more because of market forces or official  fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12  January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African  Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French  franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of  course, did not cut the real output of these countries by  half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense  expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency  accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when  GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example,  when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of  Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers  for GDP and other economic data can not be chained together  from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes  in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by  statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of  information, and changes in national"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/277"],[0,"Trinity Site (#3)"],[1,"in the northeast  corner of the house was selected by the Project personnel for the  assembly of the plutonium core of the Trinity device. Workmen installed  work benches, tables, and other equipment in this large room. To keep  the desert dust and sand out, the room's windows and cracks were covered  with plastic and sealed with tape. The core of the bomb consisted of  two hemispheres of plutonium, (Pu-239), and an initiator. According  to reports, while scientists assembled the initiator and the Pu-239  hemispheres, jeeps were positioned outside with their engines running  for a quick getaway if needed. Detection devices were used to monitor  radiation levels in the room, and when fully assembled the core was warm  to the touch. The completed core was later transported the two miles to  Ground Zero, inserted into the bomb assembly, and raised to the top of  the tower.    The Trinity explosion on Monday morning, July 16, did not significantly  damage the McDonald house. Even though most of the windows were blown  out, and the chimney was blown over, the main structure survived intact.  Years of rain water dripping through holes in the metal roof did much  more damage to the mud brick walls than the bomb did. The nearby barn  did not fare as well. The Trinity test blew part of its roof off, and  the roof has since totally collapsed.    The ranch house stood empty and deteriorating for 37 years until 1982  when the US Army stabilized it to prevent any further damage. The next  year, the Department of Energy and the Army provided funds for the  National Park Service to completely restore the house to the way it  appeared in July, 1945. When the work was completed, the house with many  photo displays on Trinity was opened to the public for the first time  in October 1984 during the semi-annual tour. The Schmidt-McDonald ranch  house is part of the Trinity National Historic Landmark.        FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 1: Szasz, Ferenc. The Day the Sun Rose Twice.

THE NATIONAL ATOMIC MUSEUM,    Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico      Since its opening in 1969, the objective of the National Atomic museum  has been to provide a readily accessible repository of educational  materials, and information on the Atomic Age. In addition, the museum's  goal is to preserve, interpret, and exhibit to the public memorabilia  of this Age. In late 1991 the museum was chartered by Congress as the  United States' only official Atomic museum.    Prominently featured in the museum's high bay is the story of the  Manhattan Engineer District, the unprecedented 2.2 billion dollar  scientific-engineering project that was centered in New Mexico during  World War II. The Manhattan Project as it was more commonly called,  developed, built, and tested the world's first Atomic bomb in New  Mexico. This display also includes casings similar to the only Atomic  bombs ever used in warfare. Dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki, these two bombs helped bring World War II to an end in  mid-August 1945. The story of the Manhattan Project's three secret  cities, Hanford, Washington, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge,  Tennessee, is also presented in this area.    A portion of the museum, the low bay, is devoted to exhibits on the  research, development, and use of various forms of nuclear energy.  Historical and other traveling exhibits are also displayed in this area.  Also found in the low bay is the museum's store, which is operated by  the museum's foundation.    Adjacent to the low bay is the theater. The featured film is David  Wolpers classic 1963 production, Ten Seconds That Shook The World. This  excellent film is a 53-minute documentary on the Manhattan Project.  Other films relating to the history of the Atomic Age are available for  viewing and checkout from the library.    Next to the theater is the library/Department of Energy public reading  room, containing government documents that are available to the public  for in-library research. The library also has many nuclear related books  available for reference and checkout.    Located around the outside of the museum are a number of large exhibits.  These include the Boeing B-52B jet bomber that dropped the United  States' last air burst H-bomb in 1962, and a 280-mm (11 inches) Atomic  cannon, once America's most powerful field artillery. Also found in  this area is a Navy TA-7C (a modified A-7B) Corsair II fighter-bomber, a  veteran of the Vietnam War. Many other nuclear weapons systems, rockets,  and missiles are found in this area.    In front of the museum are a pair of Navy Terrier missiles. The Terrier  was the Navy's first operational surface to air missile. To the south  of the museum, next to the visitors parking lot, is a Republic F-105D  Thunderchief fighter-bomber. Further south is a World War II Boeing  B-29 Superfortress. This plane is similar to the B-29's, Enola Gay and  Bockscar that dropped the Atomic bombs on Japan.    The National Atomic Museum, is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except  for New Years Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The museum  is located at 20358 Wyoming Blvd. SE, on Kirtland Air Force Base,  Albuquerque, New Mexico. Guided tours for groups are available by  calling (505)845-4636 in advance. Admission and tours are free, and  cameras are always welcome!"]]]
