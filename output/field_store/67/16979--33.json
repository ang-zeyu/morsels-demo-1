Every other \"receet\" seemed to tumble out gladly, and stare them  in the face--little dingy rolls of yellow paper, with an ancient odor  of spice still clinging to them; but all efforts to find this particular  one failed utterly.    \"Won't some other one do?\" asked Polly, in the interval of fruitless  searching, when grandma bewailed and lamented, and wondered, \"where I  could a put it!\"    \"No, no, child,\" answered the old lady; \"now, where do you s'pose 'tis!\"  and she clapped both hands to her head, to see if she could possibly  remember; \"no, no, child,\" she repeated. \"Why, they had it down to my  niece Mirandy's weddin'--'twas just elegant! light as a feather; and  'twan't rich either,\" she added; \"no eggs, nor--\"    \"Oh, I couldn't have eggs;\" cried Polly, in amazement at the thought of  such luxury; \"and we've only brown flour, grandma, you know.\"    \"Well, you can make it of brown,\" said Mrs. Bascom, kindly; \"when the  raisins is in 'twill look quite nice.\"    \"Oh, we haven't any raisins,\" answered Polly.    \"Haven't any raisins!\" echoed grandma, looking at her over her  spectacles; \"what are you goin' to put in?\"    \"Oh--cinnamon,\" said Polly, briskly; \"we've got plenty of that,  and--it'll be good, I guess, grandma!\" she finished, anxiously; \"anyway,  we must have a cake; there isn't any other way to celebrate mamsie's  birthday.\"    \"Well, now,\" said grandma, bustling around; \"I shouldn't be surprised  if you had real good luck, Polly. And your ma'll set ever so much by it;  now, if we only could find that receet!\" and returning to the charge she  commenced to fumble among her bits of paper again; \"I never shall forget  how they eat on it; why, there wasn't a crumb left, Polly!\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, to whom \"Mirandy's wedding cake\" now became the  height of her desires; \"if you only can find it! can't I climb up and  look on the pantry shelves?\"    \"Maybe 'tis there,\" said Mrs. Bascom, slowly; \"you might try; sometimes  I do put things away, so's to have 'em safe.\"    So Polly got an old wooden chair, according to direction, and then  mounted up on it, with grandma below to direct, she handed down bowl  after bowl, interspersed at the right intervals with cracked teacups and  handleless pitchers. But at the end of these explorations, \"Mirandy's  wedding cake\" was further off than ever.    \"Tain't a mite o' use,\" at last said the old lady, sinking down in  despair, while Polly perched on the top of the chair and looked at her;  \"I must a-give it away.\"    \"Can't I have the next best one, then?\" asked Polly, despairingly,  feeling sure that \"Mirandy's wedding cake\" would have celebrated the day  just right; \"and I must hurry right home, please,\" she added, getting  down from the chair, and tying on her hood; \"or Phronsie won't know what  to do.\"    So another \"receet\" was looked over, and selected; and with many  charges, and bits of advice not to let the oven get too hot, etc., etc.,  Polly took the precious bit in her hand, and flew over home.    \"Now, we've got to--\" she began, bounding in merrily, with dancing eyes;  but her delight had a sudden stop, as she brought up so suddenly at  the sight within, that she couldn't utter another word. Phronsie was  crouching, a miserable little heap of woe, in one corner of the mother's  big calico-covered rocking-chair, and crying bitterly, while Joel hung  over her in the utmost concern.    \"What's the matter?\" gasped Polly. Flinging the \"receet\" on the table,  she rushed up to the old chair and was down on her knees before it, her  arms around the little figure. Phronsie turned, and threw herself into  Polly's protecting arms, who gathered her up, and sitting down in the  depths of the chair, comforted her as only she could.    \"What is it?\" she asked of Joel, who was nervously begging Phronsie not  to cry; \"now, tell me all that's happened.\"    \"I was a-nailing,\" began Joel; \"oh dear! don't cry, Phronsie! do stop  her, Polly.\"    \"Go on,\" said Polly, hoarsely.    \"I was a-nailing,\" began Joel, slowly; \"and--and--Davie's gone to get  the peppermint,\" he added, brightening up.    \"Tell me, Joe,\" said Polly, \"all that's been going on,\" and she looked  sternly into his face; \"or I'll get Davie to,\" as little Davie came  running back, with a bottle of castor oil, which in his flurry he had  mistaken for peppermint. This he presented with a flourish to Polly, who  was too excited to see it.    \"Oh, no!\" cried Joel, in intense alarm; \"Davie isn't going to! I'll  tell, Polly; I will truly.\"    \"Go on, then,\" said Polly; \"tell at once;\" (feeling as if somebody  didn't tell pretty quick, she should tumble over.)    \"Well,\" said Joel, gathering himself up with a fresh effort, \"the old  hammer was a-shaking and Phronsie stuck her foot in the way--and--I  couldn't help it, Polly--no, I just couldn't, Polly.\"    Quick as a flash, Polly tore off the little old shoe, and well-worn  stocking, and brought to light Phronsie's fat little foot. Tenderly  taking hold of the white toes, the boys clustering around in the  greatest anxiety, she worked them back and forth, and up and down.  \"Nothing's broken,\" she said at last, and drew a long breath.    \"It's there,\" said Phronsie, through a rain of tears; \"and it hurts,  Polly;\" and she began to wiggle the big toe, where around the nail was  settling a small black spot.    \"Poor little toe,\" began Polly, cuddling up the suffering foot. Just  then, a small and peculiar noise struck her ear; and looking up she saw  Joel, with a very distorted face, making violent efforts to keep from  bursting out into a loud cry. All his attempts, however, failed; and  he flung himself into Polly's lap in a perfect torrent of tears. \"I  didn't--mean to--Polly,\" he cried; \"'twas the--ugly, old hammer! oh  dear!\"    \"There, there, Joey, dear,\" said Polly, gathering him up in the other  corner of the old chair, close to her side; \"don't feel bad; I know you  didn't mean to,\" and she dropped a kiss on his stubby black hair.    When Phronsie saw that anybody else could cry, she stopped immediately,  and leaning over Polly, put one little fat hand on Joel's neck. \"Don't  cry,\" she said; \"does your toe ache?\"    At this, Joel screamed louder than ever; and Polly was at her wit's  end to know what to do; for the boy's heart was almost broken. That he  should have hurt Phronsie! the baby, the pet of the whole house, upon  whom all their hearts centered--it was too much. So for the next few  moments, Polly had all she could do by way of comforting and consoling  him. Just as she had succeeded, the door opened, and Grandma Bascom  walked in.    \"Settin' down?\" said she; \"I hope your cake ain't in, Polly,\" looking  anxiously at the stove, \"for I've found it;\" and she waved a small piece  of paper triumphantly towards the rocking-chair as she spoke.    \"Do tell her,\" said Polly to little David, \"what's happened; for I can't  get up.\"    So little Davie went up to the old lady, and standing on tiptoe,  screamed into her ear all the particulars he could think of, concerning  the accident that had just happened.    \"Hey?\" said grandma, in a perfect bewilderment; \"what's he a-sayin',  Polly--I can't make it out.\"    \"You'll have to go all over it again, David,\" said Polly, despairingly;  \"she didn't hear one word, I don't believe.\"    So David tried again; this time with better success. And then he got  down from his tiptoes, and escorted grandma to Phronsie, in flushed  triumph.    \"Land alive!\" said the old lady, sitting down in the chair which he  brought her; \"you got pounded, did you?\" looking at Phronsie, as she  took the little foot in her ample hand.    \"Yes'm,\" said Polly, quickly; \"twasn't any one's fault; what'll we do  for it, grandma?\"    \"Wormwood,\" said the old lady, adjusting her spectacles in extreme  deliberation, and then examining the little black and blue spot, which  was spreading rapidly, \"is the very best thing; and I've got some to  home--you run right over,\" she said, turning round on David, quickly,  \"an' get it; it's a-hang-in' by the chimbley.\"    \"Let me; let me!\" cried Joel, springing out of the old chair, so  suddenly that grandma's spectacles nearly dropped off in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#3)"],[1,"1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c.    2. Pipettes of 1 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.01 c.c. (Fig. 10, a).    3. Pipettes of 10 c.c. capacity graduated in 0.1 c.c. (Fig. 10, b).    These should be about 30 cm. in length (1 and 2 of fairly narrow bore),  graduated to the extreme point, and having at least a 10 cm. length of  clear space between the first graduation and the upper end; the open  mouth should be plugged with cotton-wool. Each variety should be  sterilised and stored in a separate cylindrical copper case some 36 by 6  cm., with \"pull-off\" lid, upon which is stamped, in plain figures, the  capacity of the contained pipettes.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Measuring pipettes, a and b.]    The laboratory should also be provided with a complete set of \"Standard\"  graduated pipettes, each pipette in the set being stamped and  authenticated by a certificate from one of the recognised Physical  Measurement Laboratories, such as Charlottenburg. These instruments are  expensive and should be reserved solely for standardising the pipettes  in ordinary use, and for calibrating small pipettes manufactured in the  laboratory. Such a set should comprise, at least, pipettes delivering 10  c.c., 5 c.c., 2.5 c.c., 2 c.c., 1 c.c., 0.5 c.c., 0.25 c.c., 0.2 c.c.,  0.1 c.c., 0.05 c.c., and 0.01 c.c., respectively.    In the immediately following sections are described small pieces of  glass apparatus which should be prepared in the laboratory from glass  tubing of various sizes. In their preparation three articles are  essential; first a three-square hard-steel file or preferably a  glass-worker's knife of hard Thuringian steel for cutting glass tubes  etc.; next a blowpipe flame, for although much can be done with the  ordinary Bunsen burner, a blowpipe flame makes for rapid work; and  lastly a bat's-wing burner.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Glass-cutting knife. a. handle. b. double  edged blade. c. shaft. d. locking nut. e. spanner for nut.]    1. The glass-cutting knife. This article is sold in two forms, a bench  knife (Fig. 11) and a pocket knife. The former is provided with a blade  some 8 cm. in length and having two cutting edges. The cutting edge when  examined in a strong light is seen to be composed of small closely set  teeth, similar to those in a saw. The knife should be kept sharp by  frequent stroppings on a sandstone hone. The pocket form, about 6-cm.  long over all, consists of a small spring blade with one cutting edge  mounted in scales like an ordinary pocket knife.    2. For real convenience of work the blowpipe should be mounted on a  special table connected up with cylindrical bellows operated by a pedal.  That figured (Fig. 12) is made by mounting a teak top 60 cm. square upon  the uprights of an enclosed double-action concertina bellows (Enfer's)  and provided with a Fletcher's Universal gas blowpipe.    3. An ordinary bat's-wing gas-burner mounted at the far corner of the  table top is invaluable in the preparation of tubular apparatus with  sharp curves, and for coating newly-made glass apparatus with a layer of  soot to prevent too rapid cooling, and its usually associated  result--cracking.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Glass blower's table with Enfer's foot  bellows.]    6. ~Sedimentation tubes 5x0.5~ cm., for sedimentation reactions, etc., and  for containing small quantities of fluid to be centrifugalised in the  haematocrit. These are made by taking 14-cm. lengths of stout glass  tubing of the requisite diameter and heating the centre in the Bunsen or  blowpipe flame. When the central portion is quite soft draw the ends  quickly apart and then round off the pointed ends of the two test-tubes  thus formed. With the glass-cutting knife cut off whatever may be  necessary from the open ends to make the tubes the required length.    A rectangular block of \"plasticine\" (modelling clay) into which the  conical ends can be thrust makes a very convenient stand for these small  tubes.    ~Capillary Pipettes or Pasteur's Pipettes~ (Fig. 13 a).--These little  instruments are invaluable, and a goodly supply should be kept on hand.  They are prepared from soft-glass tubing of various-sized calibre (the  most generally useful size being 8 mm. diameter) in the following  manner: Hold a 10 cm. length of glass tube by each end, and whilst  rotating it heat the central portion in the Bunsen flame or the blowpipe  blast-flame until the glass is red hot and soft. Now remove it from the  flame and steadily pull the ends apart, so drawing the heated portion  out into a roomy capillary tube; break the capillary portion at its  centre, seal the broken ends in the flame, and round off the edges of  the open end of each pipette. A loose plug of cotton-wool in the open  mouth completes the capillary pipette. After a number have been  prepared, they are sterilised and stored in batches, either in metal  cases similar to those used for the graduated pipettes or in large-sized  test-tubes--sealed ends downward and plugged ends toward the mouth of  the case.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Capillary pipettes. a, b, c.]    The filling and emptying of the capillary pipette is most satisfactorily  accomplished by slipping a small rubber teat (similar to that on a  baby's feeding bottle but _not perforated_) on the upper end, after  cutting or snapping off the sealed point of the capillary portion. If  pressure is now exerted upon the elastic bulb by a finger and thumb  whilst the capillary end is below the surface of the fluid to be taken  up, some of the contained air will be driven out, and subsequent  relaxation of that pressure (resulting in the formation of a partial  vacuum) will cause the fluid to ascend the capillary tube. Subsequent  compression of the bulb will naturally result in the complete expulsion  of the fluid from the pipette (Fig. 14).    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Filling the capillary teat-pipette.]    A modification of this pipette, in which a constriction or short length  of capillary tube is introduced just below the plugged mouth (Fig. 13,  b), will also be found extremely useful in the collection and storage  of morbid exudations.    A third form, where the capillary portion is about 4 or 5 cm. long and  only forms a small fraction of the entire length of the pipette (Fig.  13, c), will also be found useful.    ~\"Blood\" Pipettes~ (Fig 15).--Special pipettes for the collection of  fairly large quantities of blood (as suggested by Pakes) should also be  prepared. These are made from _soft_ glass tubing of 1 cm. bore, in a  similar manner to the Pasteur pipettes, except that the point of the  blowpipe flame must be used in order to obtain the sharp shoulder at  either end of the central bulb. The terminal tubes must retain a  diameter of at least 1 mm., in order to avoid capillary action during  the collection of the fluid.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Blood pipettes and hair-lip pin in a  test-tube.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Blood-pipette in metal thermometer case.]    For sterilisation and storage each pipette is placed inside a test-tube,  resting on a wad of cotton-wool, and the tube plugged in the ordinary  manner. As these tubes are used almost exclusively for blood work, it is  usual to place a lance-headed hare-lip pin or a No. 9 flat Hagedorn  needle inside the tube so that the entire outfit may be sterilised at  one time.    For the collection of small quantities of blood for agglutination  reactions and the like, many prefer a short straight piece of narrow  glass tubing drawn out at either extremity to almost capillary  dimensions. Such pipettes, about 8 cm. in length over all, are most  conveniently sterilized in ordinary metal thermometer cases (Fig. 16).    ~Graduated Capillary Pipettes~ (Fig. 17).--These should also be made in  the laboratory--from manometer tubing--of simple, convenient shape, and  graduated by the aid of \"standard\" pipettes (in hundredths) to contain  such quantities as 10, 50, and 90 c. mm., and carefully marked with a  writing diamond. These, previously sterilised in large test-tubes, will  be found extremely useful in preparing accurate percentage solutions,  when only minute quantities of fluid are available.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Capillary graduated pipettes.]    ~Automatic (\"Throttle\") Pipettes.~--These ingenious pipettes, introduced  by Wright, can easily be calibrated in the laboratory and are  exceedingly useful for graduating small pipettes, for measuring small  quantities of fluids, in preparing dilutions of serum for agglutination  reactions, etc. They are usually made from the Capillary Pasteur  pipettes (Fig. 13, a). The following description of the manufacture of  a 5 c. mm. pipette will serve to show how the small automatic pipettes  are calibrated.    1. Select a pipette the capillary portion of which is fairly roomy in  bore and possesses regular even walls, and remove the cotton-wool plug  from the open end.    2. Heat the capillary portion near the free extremity in the by-pass  flame of the bunsen burner and draw it out into a very fine hair-like  tube and break this across. This hair-like extremity will permit the  passage of air but is too fine for metallic mercury to pass.    3. From a standard graduated pipette deliver 5 c. mm. clean mercury into  the upper wide portion of the pipette.    4. Adjust a rubber teat to the pipette and by pressure on the bulb  gradually drive the mercury in an unbroken column down the capillary  tube until it is stopped by the filiform extremity.    5. Cut off the capillary tube exactly at the upper level of the column  of mercury, invert it and allow the mercury to run out.    6. Snap off the remainder of the capillary tube from the broad upper  portion of the pipette which is now destined to form the covering tube  or air chamber, or what we may term the \"barrel.\" This barrel now has  the lower end in the form of a truncated cone, the upper end being cut  square.
