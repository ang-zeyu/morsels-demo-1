I stood with my back to the wall; for I wanted no sword reaching  out of the dark for me.    \"'Now start up the fire,' I said.    \"'Come, come!' I called, when no one obeyed. 'A fire! This is cold  welcome for your guests.'    \"My men laughed.    \"'Yes, a stingy host! He acts as though he had not expected us.'    \"But now the farmer was blowing on the coals and putting on fresh wood.  Soon it blazed up, and we could see about us. We were in a little feast  hall,[4] with its fire down the middle of it. There were benches for  twenty men along each side. The farmer crouched by the fire, afraid to  move. On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.    \"'Ho, thralls!' I called to them. 'Bring in the table. We are hungry.'    \"Off they ran through a door at the back of the hall. My men came in and  lay down by the fire and warmed themselves, but I set two of them as  guards at the door.    \"'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one, 'why such a long face? Do you not  think we shall be merry company?'    \"'We came only to cheer you,' said another. 'What man wants to spend the  winter with no guests?'    \"'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting up. 'Here comes something that  will be a welcome guest to my stomach.'    \"The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat. They set up a crane  over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil  while we joked. At last the supper began. The farmer sat gloomily on the  bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting  potfuls of his good beef and basket-loads of bread into our big mouths.  When the tables were taken out and the mead-horns came round, I stood up  and raised my horn and said to the farmer:    \"'You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I  drink this to your health.'    \"Then I drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to  the farmer. He took it and smiled, saying:    \"'Since it is to my health, I will drink it. I thought that all this  night's work would be my death.'    \"'Oh, do not fear that!' I laughed, 'for a dead man sets no tables.'    \"So we drank and all grew merrier. At last I stood up and said:    \"'I like this little taste of your hospitality, friend farmer. I have  decided to accept more of it.'    \"My men roared with laughter.    \"'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for that, farmer. Did you ever have such  a lordly guest before?'    \"I went on:    \"'Now there is no fun in having guests unless they keep you company and  make you merry. So I will give out this law: that my men shall never  leave you alone. Hakon there shall be your constant companion, friend  farmer. He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or  playing or sleeping. Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to  your two sons.'    \"I named nine others and said:    \"'And these shall follow your thralls in the same way. Now, am I not  careful to make your time go merrily?'    \"So I set guards over every one in that house. Not once all that winter  did they stir out of sight of some of us. So no tales got out to the  neighbors. Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came  that way. Oh! that was fat and easy living.    \"Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakon came in to the  feast one night and said:    \"'I heard a cuckoo to-day!'    \"'It is the call to go a-viking,' I said.    \"All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted. Their eyes  danced. Big Thorleif stood up and stretched himself.    \"'I am stiff with long sitting,' he said. 'I itch for a fight.'    \"I turned to the farmer.    \"'This is our last feast with you,' I said.    \"'Well,' he laughed, 'this has been the busiest winter I ever spent, and  the merriest. May good luck go with you!'    \"'By the beard of Odin!' I cried; 'you have taken our joke like a man.'    \"My men pounded the table with their fists.    \"'By the hammer of Thor!' shouted Grim. 'Here is no stingy coward. He is  a man fit to carry my drinking-horn, the horn of a sea-rover and a  sword-swinger. Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the  farmer's hand. 'May you drink heart's-ease from it for many years. And  with it I leave you a name, Sif the Friendly. I shall hope to drink with  you sometime in Valhalla.'    \"Then all my men poured around that farmer and clapped him on the  shoulder and piled things upon him, saying:    \"'Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly.'    \"'And here is a bracelet.'    \"'A sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side.'    \"I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave  them to him.    \"The old man's eyes opened wide at all these things, and at the same  time he laughed.    \"'May Odin send me such guests every winter!' he said.    \"Early next morning we shook hands with our host and boarded the  'Waverunner' and sailed off.    \"'Where shall we go?' my men asked.    \"'Let the gods decide,' I said, and tossed up my spear.    \"When it fell on the deck it pointed up-shore, so I steered in that  direction. That is the best way to decide, for the spear will always  point somewhere, and one thing is as good as another. That time it  pointed us into your father's ships. They closed in battle with us and  killed my men and sunk my ship and dragged me off a prisoner. They were  three against one, or they might have tasted something more bitter at  our hands. They took me before King Halfdan.    \"'Here,' they said, 'is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts. We  sunk his ship and men, but him we brought to you.'    \"'A robber viking?' said the king, and scowled at me.    \"I threw back my head and laughed.    \"'Yes. And with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me.'    \"The king frowned more angrily.    \"'Saucy, too?' he said. 'Well, thieves must die. Take him out, Thorkel,  and let him taste your sword.'    \"Your mother, the queen, was standing by. Now she put her hand on his  arm and smiled and said:    \"'He is only a lad. Let him live. And would he not be a good gift for  our baby?'    \"Your father thought a moment, then looked at your mother and smiled.    \"'Soft heart!' he said gently to her; then to Thorkel, 'Well, let him  go, Thorkel!'    \"Then he turned to me again, frowning.    \"'But, young sharp-tongue, now that we have caught you we will put you  into a trap that you cannot get out of. Weld an iron collar on his  neck.'    \"So I lived and now am your tooth thrall. Well, it is the luck of war.  But by the chair of Odin, I kept my vow!\"    \"Yes!\" cried Harald, jumping to his feet. \"And had a joke into the  bargain. Ah! sometime I will make a brave vow like that.\"    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [3] See note about drinking-horns on page 195.    [4] See note about feast hall on page 196.          [Illustration]    Olaf's Fight With Havard      At another time Harald said:    \"Tell me of a fight, Olaf. I want to hear about the music of swords.\"    Olaf's eyes blazed.    \"I will tell you of our fight with King Havard,\" he said.    \"One dark night we had landed at a farm. We left our 'Waverunner' in the  water with three men to guard her. The rest of us went into the house.  The farmer met us at the door, but he died by Thorkel's sword. The  others we shut into their beds.[5] The door at each end of the hall we  had barred on the inside so that nobody could surprise us. We were busy  going through the cupboards and shouting at our good luck. But suddenly  we heard a shout outside:    \"'Thor and Havard!'    \"Then there was a great beating at the doors.    \"'He has two hundred fighters with him,' said Grim; 'for we saw his  ships last night. Thirty against two hundred! We shall all drink in  Valhalla to-night.'    \"'Well,' I cried, 'Odin shall have no unwilling guest in me.'    \"'Nor in me,' cried Hakon.    \"'Nor in me,' shouted Thorkel.    \"And that shout went all around, and we drew out our swords and caught  up our shields.    \"'Hot work is ahead of us,' said Hakon. 'Besides, we must leave none of  this mead for Havard. Lend a hand, some one.'    \"Then he and another pulled out a great tub that sat on the floor of the  cupboard.    \"'I drink to Valhalla to-night,' cried Thorkel the Thirsty, and he  plunged his horn deep into the tub.    \"When he brought it up, his sleeve was dripping and the sweet mead was  running over from the horn.    \"'Sloven!' cried Hakon, and he struck Thorkel with his fist and knocked  him over into the cupboard.    \"He fell against the wooden wall at the back, and a carved panel swung  open behind him. He dropped down head first. In a minute he put his head  out of the hole again. We all stood staring.    \"'I think it is a secret passage,' he said.    \"'We will try it,' I answered in a whisper. 'Throw dirt on the fire. It  must be dark.'    \"So we dug up dirt from the earth floor and smothered the fire. All this  time there was a terrible shouting and hammering at the doors, but they  were of heavy logs and stood.    \"'I with four more will guard this door,' I said, pointing to the east  end.    \"Immediately four men stepped to my side.    \"'And I will guard the other,' Hakon said, and four went with him.    \"'The rest of you, down the hole!' I said. 'Close the door after you. If  luck is with us we will meet at the ships. Now Thor and our good swords  help us! Quick! The doors are giving way.'    \"So we ten men stood at the doors and held back the king's soldiers. It  was dark in the room, and the people out of doors could not tell how  many were inside. Few were eager to be the first in.    \"'Thirty swords are waiting in there to eat up the first man,' we heard  some one say.    \"We chuckled at that.    \"But the king stood in the very doorway and fought. Our five swords held  him back for a long time, but at last he pushed in, and his men poured  after him. We ran back and hid behind some tubs in a dark corner.

Come, old lad, don't sham idleness.\"    \"It isn't sham,\" said Dyke.  \"I don't think I used to be idle, but this  hot sun has stewed all the spirit out of me.\"    Joe said nothing, but led the way round to the back of the long low  house, to where a high thick hedge of thorns shut in a lean-to shed  thatched with mealie leaves and stalks; these, the dry remains of a load  of Indian corn, being laid on heavily, so as to form a good shelter for  the horses, haltered to a rough manger beneath.    As Dyke approached, he raised a metal whistle which hung from his neck  by a leather thong, and blew loudly.  A low whinny answered the call,  and a big, raw-boned, powerful horse and a handsome, well-bred cob were  unhaltered, to turn and stand patiently enough to be bridled and  saddled, afterwards following out their masters like dogs.    And now as they passed the end of the stable, all the languor and  lassitude passed away from Dyke on the instant.  For he now caught sight  of their Kaffir servant lying fast asleep just beneath the eaves of the  corrugated iron roof.    The sand hushed the horses' hoofs, and the Kaffir slept on, with the  flies buzzing about his half-open mouth, as if they mistook the thick  red lips for the petals of some huge flower.    \"I'm not going to stand that,\" said the boy.    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"You'll see,\" whispered Dyke.  \"If I'm to be toiling after goblins, he's  not going to sleep there like a black pig.  Go on a little way and look  back.\"    Joe Emson smiled in a heavy, good-humoured way, as he took the bridle  his brother handed to him, and the smile developed into a silent laugh,  as he saw the boy's energy over a bit of mischief.    For Dyke actually ran back to the stable, brought out a bucket of water,  stood counting the furrows of the iron roofing, and then carried the  pail round to the other side and set it down.    His next movement was to fetch a roughly made step-ladder, count the  furrows on his side, then place the ladder carefully, and at such a  slope that it lay flat on the roof, so that, steadily preserving his  balance, he walked up with the bucket of water from round to round till  he could see across the ridge to where his brother stood with the horses  a hundred yards away, watching over the big nag's mane, and grasping now  what was to happen.    Dyke knelt down now behind the ridge, to which the top of the ladder  just reached, and had calculated his distance so well, that upon tilting  the bucket a little, some water trickled down two of the furrows of an  iron sheet, and began to drip from the eaves upon the Kaffir's nude  chest.    There was no movement, so a little more water was poured, and this  brought forth a pig-like grunt, as if of satisfaction.    More water--more grunts.    More water, and a shuffling movement.    More water, and an angry gasp; the Kaffir raised his head, looked up at  the sky, the dripping eaves--looked round, and settled down to sleep.    All this was invisible to Dyke, but he could tell by the sounds that his  shower was having effect; and as soon as the man ceased to move, the boy  sent down a third of the bucketful.    This produced a sharp ejaculation, and the man sprang up into a sitting  position, and looking angrily round, saw that Emson was standing far  away with the horses, and that no one else was near.  His next glance  was at the cloudless sky, and the dripping eaves, to which a few bright  drops still hung and ceased to fall.    Only a rare shower, the man seemed to think; and, muttering to himself,  he shuffled a little into a dry spot to lie down yawning, when rush came  the rest of the water, deluging him this time, and making him jump up  and burst into a torrent of objurgations against the sky in his own  tongue, shaking both his fists the while, till, _bang, clatter, crash_!  the bucket came rattling down, and he turned and ran out toward where  Emson stood looking on.    Dyke descended quickly, and making a circuit, he ran round, and then  appeared slowly from the end of a fence fifty yards from the house,  walking quietly across to join his brother.    As he drew near, the Kaffir was gesticulating and talking away in broken  English, mingled with more words of his own tongue; and when Dyke joined  them and took the rein of his little cob, the man turned excitedly to  him.    \"What's the matter, Jack?\"    The Kaffir looked at him suspiciously for a moment or two, but Dyke  mounted and returned the gaze in the most unruffled manner.    \"Big rain--big wet rain--big water--big bucket--all wet, wet,\" cried the  Kaffir.    \"Make the mealies grow,\" said Dyke coolly.    \"Make mealie grow!\" cried the man.  Then a change came over him.  The  look of doubt and wonder became one of certainty, and his face  expanded into a broad grin which displayed all his white teeth.  \"Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!\" he cried, pointing to a couple of wet patches on  the leg of the boy's trousers; \"you make rain--Massa Dyky make rain.  Wet, wet.  Ah-ah-ah-ah!\"    \"You come along and help drive the ostrich,\" said Dyke, setting his cob  to canter; and, followed by the Kaffir at a quick trot, which soon dried  up his moisture, they went over the heated red sand toward where the  speck in the distance had been pointed out as the object they sought.        CHAPTER THREE.    AN OSTRICH RACE.    \"I say, Joe, you are right,\" said Dyke now, with animation.  \"'Tisn't  half so hot riding.\"    \"Of course not.  One begins to get moist, and the sun and air bring a  feeling of coolness.  It's only the making a start.  Now then, shall I  try to cut him off?\"    \"No, no!\" cried Dyke excitedly; \"I'll do it.  I'll make the brute run.  You follow up.\"    \"Right!\" said Emson; \"that is, unless he tracks my way.\"    \"Oh, he won't do that,\" said Dyke, with a merry laugh, and in his  animation the boy seemed to be quite transformed.    It was a good long ride to where the ostrich they sought to bring back  to its pen could be seen stalking about, looking about as big as a  guinea-fowl, but gradually growing taller and taller to its pursuers as  they rode on.  After a time it ceased picking about and ran first in one  direction and then in another, as if undecided which line of country to  take before leading its pursuers a wild race out and across the veldt.    By this time it looked fully four feet high; soon after it was fully  five, as it stood up with its neck stretched out, and its weak,  large-eyed, flat head turned to them with a malicious expression.    The trio now separated, the horsemen riding more and more apart as they  advanced, till they were each a couple of hundred yards from the Kaffir,  who suddenly uttered a warning cry, to indicate that the great bird was  beginning to run off straight away.    \"All right, Jack, I see,\" cried Dyke; and pressing his cob's sides he  went off at a gallop, not, however, in pursuit of the bird, which ran  right forward, with its head turned to watch its pursuers all the time.    Dyke's tactics, the result of experience, were of quite another kind.  He turned his cob's head, and went off like the wind at right angles to  the course the ostrich was taking, and the effect was instantaneous.  There was all the open veldt, or plain, spreading out for hundreds of  miles before the bird, and it had only to dart off and leave the  swiftest horse far behind.  But its would-be cunning nature suggested to  it that its enemy had laid a deep scheme to cut it off, and instead of  going straight away, it turned on the instant to spin along in the same  direction as that taken by the boy, and get right across him.    \"Ah, you silly, muddled-brained, flat-headed idiot!\" yelled Dyke, as he  raced along over the plain, his steed sending the red sand flying at  every spurn of its hoofs as it stretched itself out.  \"I'll be there  first, and cut him off.  You can't do it--you can't do it.  Ah-h-h-h!\"    This last shout, ending in a rattle of the tongue, seemed to stimulate  the little cob to make fresh efforts; and laughing merrily to himself in  the exhilaration of the race, Dyke had only to keep slightly drawing his  left rein, to make the ostrich curve more and more round towards him,  till he had actually deluded the bird into taking the exact direction he  wished--namely, right for the pens from which it had escaped.    On sped the cob, running over the sand like a greyhound, and on rushed  the ostrich, its long legs going with a half-invisible twinkling effect  like that produced by the spokes of a rapidly revolving wheel; its wings  were half-extended, its plumage ruffled, and its long neck stretched  out, with its flattened head slightly turned in the direction of the  rider.    And so they rode on and on, till the low range of buildings in front  became nearer, the yellow sunflower disks grew bigger, and the sun  glared from the white house.  Still the bird saw nothing of this, but  continued to run in its curve, trying to pass its pursuer, till all at  once it woke to the fact that there was a long range of wire fence  before it, over which were bobbing about the heads of Joe Emson's flock  of its fellows, and there it was with the fence in front, and the two  horsemen and Kaffir behind.    Then there was a change of tactics.    Dyke, who was hundreds of yards in front of his companions, knew what  was coming, and gave his short-handled rhinoceros-hide whip a whish  through the air, and then cracked it loudly, while a chorus of  discordant cries arose from the pens.    \"Give up, you ugly old rascal, or I'll twist this round your long neck,\"  cried Dyke; and a great chorus arose from the pens, as if the tame birds  within the wire fence were imploring the great truant to be good, and  come home.    But nothing was further from the great bird's thoughts.  It could easily  now have"]]]
