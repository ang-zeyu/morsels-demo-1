Subsequently, when in 1848, at the instance of the Prussian  government, the Rev. Mr. Dzierzon published his \"Theory and Practice of  Bee Culture,\" I imported a copy, which reached me in 1849, and which I  translated prior to January 1850. Before the translation was completed,  I received a visit from my friend, the Rev. Dr. Berg, of Philadelphia,  and in the course of conversation on bee-keeping, mentioned to him the  Dzierzon theory and system, as one which I regarded as new and very  superior, though I had had no opportunity for testing it practically. In  February following, when in Philadelphia, I left with him the  translation in manuscript--up to which period, I doubt whether any other  person in this country had any knowledge of the Dzierzon theory; except  to Dr. Berg I had never mentioned it to any one, save in very general  terms.    In September, 1851, Dr. Berg again visited York, and stated to me your  investigations, discoveries and inventions. From the account Dr. Berg  gave me, I felt assured that you had devised substantially the _same  system_ as that so successfully pursued by Mr. Dzierzon; but how far  _your hive_ resembled his I was unable to judge from description alone.  I inferred, however, several points of difference. The coincidence as to  system, and the principles on which it was evidently founded, struck me  as exceedingly singular and interesting, because I felt confident that  you had no more knowledge of Mr. Dzierzon and his labors, before Dr.  Berg mentioned him and his book to you, than Mr. Dzierzon had of you.  These circumstances made me very anxious to examine your hives, and  induced me to visit your Apiary in the village of West Philadelphia,  last August. In the absence of the keeper, as I informed you, I took the  liberty to explore the premises thoroughly, opening and inspecting a  number of the hives, and noticing the internal arrangement of the parts.  The result was, that I came away convinced that though your system was  based on the same principles as Dzierzon's, yet that your hive was  almost totally different from his, in construction and arrangement; that  while the same objects _substantially_ are attained by each, your hive  is more simple, more convenient, and much better adapted for general  introduction and use, since the mode of using it can be more easily  taught. Of its ultimate and triumphant success I have no doubt. I  sincerely believe that when it comes under the notice of Mr. Dzierzon,  he will himself prefer it to his own. It in fact combines all the good  properties which a hive ought to possess, while it is free from the  complication, clumsiness, _vain whims_, and decidedly objectionable  features, which characterize most of the inventions which profess to be  at all superior to the simple box, or the common chamber hive.    You may certainly claim _equal credit_ with Dzierzon for originality in  observation and discovery in the natural history of the honey bee, and  for success in deducing principles and devising a most valuable system  of management from observed facts. But in _invention_, as far as  neatness, compactness, and adaptation of means to ends are concerned,  the sturdy German must yield the palm to you. You will find a case of  similar coincidence detailed in the Westminster Review for October,  1852, page 267, et seq.    I send you herewith some interesting statements respecting Dzierzon, and  the estimate in which his system is held in Germany.                               Very truly yours,                                         SAMUEL WAGNER.      REV. L. L. LANGSTROTH.    The following are the statements to which Mr. Wagner refers.--    \"As the best test of the value of Mr. Dzierzon's system, is the  _results_ which have been made to flow from it, a brief account of its  rise and progress maybe found interesting. In 1835 he commenced  bee-keeping in the common way, with 12 colonies--and after various  mishaps, which taught him the defects of the common hives and the old  mode of management, his stock was so reduced that in 1838 he had  virtually to begin anew. At this period he contrived his improved hive  in its ruder form, which gave him the command over all the combs, and he  began to experiment on the theory which observation and study had  enabled him to devise. Thenceforward his progress was as rapid as his  success was complete and triumphant. Though he met with frequent  reverses--about 70 colonies having been stolen from him, sixty destroyed  by fire, and 24 by a flood--yet in 1846 his stock had increased to 360  colonies, and he realized from them that year six thousand pounds of  honey, besides several hundred weight of wax. At the same time most of  the cultivators in his vicinity who pursued the common methods, had  fewer hives than they had when he commenced.    In the year 1848, a fatal pestilence, known by the name of \"foul brood,\"  prevailed among his bees, and destroyed nearly all his colonies before  it could be subdued--only about ten having escaped the malady, which  attacked alike the old stocks and his artificial swarms. He estimates  his entire loss that year at over 500 _colonies_. Nevertheless he  succeeded so well in multiplying by artificial swarms, the few that  remained healthy, that in the fall of 1851 his stock consisted of nearly  400 colonies. He must, therefore, have multiplied his stocks more than  three fold each year.\"    The highly prosperous condition of his colonies is attested by the  Report of the Secretary of the Annual Apiarian Convention which met in  his vicinity last spring. This Convention, the fourth which has been  held, consisted of 112 experienced and enthusiastic bee-keepers from  various districts of Germany and neighboring countries, and among them  were some who when they assembled were strong opposers of his system.    They visited and personally examined the Apiaries of Mr. Dzierzon. The  report speaks in the very highest terms of his success, and of the  manifest superiority of his system of management. He exhibited and  satisfactorily explained to his visitors his practice and principles;  and they remarked, with astonishment, the _singular docility_ of his  bees, and the thorough control to which they were subjected. After a  full detail of the proceedings, the Secretary goes on to say:--    \"Now that I have seen Dzierzon's method practically demonstrated, I must  admit that it is attended with fewer difficulties than I had supposed.  With his hive and system of management it would seem that bees become at  once more docile than they are in other cases. I consider his system the  simplest and best means of elevating bee-culture to a profitable  pursuit, and of spreading it far and wide over the land--especially as  it is peculiarly adapted to districts in which the bees do not readily  and regularly swarm. His eminent success in re-establishing his stock  after suffering so heavily from the devastating pestilence--in short the  recuperative power of the system demonstrates conclusively, that it  furnishes the best, perhaps the only means of reinstating bee-culture lo  a profitable branch of rural economy.    Dzierzon modestly disclaimed the idea of having attained perfection in  his hive. He dwelt rather upon the truth and importance of his _theory_  and _system_ of _management_.\"    _From the Leipzig Illustrated Almanac--Report on Agriculture for 1846._    \"Bee culture is no longer regarded as of any importance in rural  economy.\"    From the same for 1851, and 1853.    \"Since Dzierzon's system has been made known an entire revolution in bee  culture has been produced. A new era has been created for it, and  bee-keepers are turning their attention to it with renewed zeal. The  merits of his discoveries are appreciated by the government, and they  recommend his system as worthy the attention of the teachers of common  schools.    Mr. Dzierzon resides in a poor sandy district of Middle Silesia, which,  according to the common notions of Apiarians, is unfavorable to  bee-culture. Yet despite of this and of various mishaps, he has  succeeded in realizing 900 dollars as the product of his bees in one  season!    By his mode of management, his bees yield, even in the poorest years,  from 10 to 15 per cent on the capital invested, and where the colonies  are produced by the Apiarian's own skill and labor they cost him only  about one-fourth the price at which they are usually valued. In ordinary  seasons the profit amounts to from 30 to 50 per cent, and in very  favorable seasons from 80 to 100 per cent.\"    In communicating these facts to the public, I have several objects in  view. I freely acknowledge that I take an honest pride in establishing  my claims as an independent observer; and as having matured by my own  discoveries, the same system of bee-culture, as that which has excited  so much interest in Germany; I desire also to have the testimony of the  translator of Dzierzon to the superior merits of my hive. Mr. Wagner is  extensively known as an able German scholar. He has taken all the  numbers of the Bee Journal, a monthly periodical which has been  published for more than fifteen years in Germany, and is probably more  familiar with the state of Apiarian culture abroad, than any man in this  country.    I am anxious further to show that the great importance which I attach to  my system of management, is amply justified by the success of those who  while pursuing the same system with inferior hives, have attained  results, which to common bee-keepers, seem almost incredible. Inventors  are very prone to form exaggerated estimates of the value of their  labors; and the American public has been so often deluded with patent  hives, devised by persons ignorant of the most important principles in  the natural history of the bee, and which have utterly failed to answer  their professed objects, that they are scarcely to be blamed for  rejecting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#3)"],[1," State. These facilities  were provided in 1850; and for twenty-one years the question of  free-schools _versus_ rate-bill schools (lees, &c.) was discussed every  January in from 3,000 to 5,000 school sections, until free schools  became voluntarily the rule, and rate-bill schools the exception. In  1871, by common consent, the free school principle was incorporated into  our school system by the Legislature, and has ever since been the  universal practice. In the adoption of this principle, and in the  successful administration of the Education Department, Dr. Ryerson at  length demonstrated that a popular (or, as it had been held in the  United States, the democratic) system of public schools was admirably  adapted to our monarchical institutions. In point of fact, leading  American educationists have often pointed out that the Canadian system  of public education was more efficient in all of its details and more  practically successful in its results, than was the ordinary American  school system in any one of the States of the Union. Thus it is that the  fame of Dr. Ryerson as a successful founder of our educational system,  rests upon a solid basis. What has been done by him will not be undone;  and the ground gone over by him will not require to be traversed again.  In the \"Story of My Life,\" not much has been said upon the subject with  which Dr. Ryerson's name has been most associated. It was distinctively  the period of his public life, and its record will be found in the  official literature of his Department. The personal reminiscences left  by him are scanty, and of themselves would present an utterly inadequate  picture of his educational work. Such a history may one day be written  as would do it justice, but I feel that in such a work as the present it  is better not to attempt a task, the proper performance of which would  make demands upon the space and time at my disposal that could not be  easily met.    There was one _role_ in which Dr. Ryerson pre-eminently excelled--that  of a controversialist. There was nothing spasmodic in his method of  controversy, although there might be in the times and occasions of his  indulging in it. He was a well-read man and an accurate thinker. His  habit, when he meditated a descent upon a foe, was to thoroughly master  the subject in dispute; to collect and arrange his materials, and then  calmly and deliberately study the whole subject--especially the weak  points in his adversary's case, and the strong points of his own. His  habits of study in early life contributed to his after success in this  matter. He was an indefatigable student; and so thoroughly did he in  early life ground himself in English subjects--grammar, logic,  rhetoric--and the classics, and that, too, under the most adverse  circumstances, that, in his subsequent active career as a writer and  controversialist, he evinced a power and readiness with his tongue and  pen, that often astonished those who were unacquainted with the  laborious thoroughness of his previous mental preparation.    It was marvellous with what wonderful effect he used the material at  hand. Like a skilful general defending a position--and his study was  always to act on the defensive--he masked his batteries, and was careful  not to exhaust his ammunition in the first encounter. He never offered  battle without having a sufficient force in reserve to overwhelm his  opponent. He never exposed a weak point, nor espoused a worthless cause.  He always fought for great principles, which to him were sacred, and he  defended them to the utmost of his ability, when they were attacked. In  such cases, Dr. Ryerson was careful not to rush into print until he had  fully mastered the subject in dispute. This statement may be questioned,  and apparent examples to the contrary adduced; but the writer knows  better, for he knows the facts. In most cases Dr. Ryerson scented the  battle from afar. Many a skirmish was improvised, and many a battle was  privately fought out before the Chief advanced to repel an attack, or to  fire the first shot in defence of his position.    A word as to the character of this work. It may be objected that I have  dealt largely with subjects of no practical interest now--with dead  issues, and with controversies for great principles, which, although  important, acrimonious, and spirited at the time, have long since lost  their interest. Let such critics reflect that the \"Story\" of such a  \"Life\" as that of Dr. Ryerson cannot be told without a statement of the  toils and difficulties which he encountered, and the triumphs which he  achieved? For this reason I have written as I have done, recounting them  as briefly as the subjects would permit.      *  *  *  *  *    In the preparation of this work I am indebted to the co-operation of my  co-trustees the Rev. Dr. Potts and Rev. Dr. Nelles, whose long and  intimate acquaintance with Dr. Ryerson (quite apart from their  acknowledged ability) rendered their counsels of great value.      *  *  *  *  *    And now my filial task is done,--imperfectly, very imperfectly I admit.  While engaged in the latter part of the work a deep dark shadow  fell--suddenly fell--upon my peaceful, happy home. This great sorrow has  almost paralyzed my energies, and has rendered it very difficult for me  to concentrate my thoughts on the loving task which twelve months ago I  had so cheerfully begun. Under these circumstances, I can but crave the  indulgence of the readers of these memorial pages of my revered and  honoured Friend, the Rev. Dr. Ryerson--the foremost Canadian of his  time.

I have written this evening the accompanying draft of circular such as  you suggested. You can alter, add to, or abridge it as you shall think  best, before printing & sending it out.              I remain, as ever,                 Yours most affectionately                      E Ryerson          ESTIMATE OF THE REV. DR. RYERSON'S CHARACTER AND LABOURS.      By the Rev. William Ormiston, D.D., LL.D.                                       New York, Oct. 6th, 1882.    My Dear Dr. Hodgins,--It affords me the sincerest pleasure, tinged with  sadness, to record, at your request, the strong feelings of devoted  personal affection which I long cherished for our mutual _father_ and  friend, Rev. Dr. Ryerson; and the high estimate, which, during an  intimacy of nearly forty years, I had been led to form of his lofty  intellectual endowments, his great moral worth, and his pervading  spiritual power. He was very dear to me while he lived, and now his  memory is to me a precious, peculiar treasure.    In the autumn of 1843, I went to Victoria College, doubting much whether  I was prepared to matriculate as a freshman. Though my attainments in  some of the subjects prescribed for examination were far in advance of  the requirements, in other subjects, I knew I was sadly deficient. On  the evening of my arrival, while my mind was burdened with the  importance of the step I had taken, and by no means free from anxiety  about the issue, Dr. Ryerson, at that time Principal of the College,  visited me in my room. I shall never forget that interview. He took me  by the hand; and few men could express as much by a mere hand-shake as  he. It was a welcome, an encouragement, an inspiration, and an earnest  of future fellowship and friendship. It lessened the timid awe I  naturally felt towards one in such an elevated position,--I had never  before seen a Principal of a College,--it dissipated all boyish  awkwardness, and awakened filial confidence. He spoke of Scotland, my  native land, and of her noble sons, distinguished in every branch of  philosophy and literature; specially of the number, the diligence, the  frugality, self-denial, and success of her college students. In this  way, he soon led me to tell him of my parentage, past life and efforts,  present hopes and aspirations. His manner was so gracious and  paternal--his sympathy so quick and genuine--his counsel so ready and  cheering--his assurances so grateful and inspiriting, that not only was  my heart _his_ from that hour, but my future career seemed brighter and  more certain than it had ever appeared before.    Many times in after years, have I been instructed, and guided, and  delighted with his conversation, always replete with interest and  information; but that first interview I can never forget: it is as fresh  and clear to me to-day as it was on the morning after it took place. It  has exerted a profound, enduring, moulding influence on my whole life.  For what, under God, I am, and have been enabled to achieve, I owe more  to that noble, unselfish, kind-hearted man than to any one else.    Dr. Ryerson was, at that time, in the prime of a magnificent manhood.  His well-developed, finely-proportioned, firmly-knit frame; his broad,  lofty brow; his keen, penetrating eye, and his genial, benignant face,  all proclaimed him every inch a man. His mental powers vigorous and  well-disciplined, his attainments in literature varied and extensive,  his experience extended and diversified, his fame as a preacher of great  pathos and power widely-spread, his claims as a doughty, dauntless  champion of the rights of the people to civil and religious liberty  generally acknowledged, his powers of expression marvellous in  readiness, richness, and beauty, his manners affable and winning, his"]]]
