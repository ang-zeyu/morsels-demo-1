And God saw that the light was good. Then God separated the light from  the darkness. And God called the light Day and the darkness Night. And  there was an evening and a morning, making the first day.    And God said, \"Let there be a sky and let it divide the waters that are  below from the waters that are above the sky.\" And it was done. And God  called the sky the Heavens. And there was an evening and a morning,  making the second day.    And God said, \"Let the waters under the heavens be brought together, and  let the dry land appear.\" And it was done. And God called the dry land  Earth and the waters that were brought together Seas. And God saw that  it was good.    And God said, \"Let plants and trees grow from the earth.\" And it was  done. And plants and trees grew from the earth, each plant bringing  forth its own kind of seed and each tree its own kind of fruit, and God  saw that it was good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the  third day.    And God said, \"Let there be lights in the heavens to separate the night  from the day. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, the days, and the  years. Let them be lights in the heavens to light the earth.\" And it was  done. So God made the two great lights (the sun and the moon): the  greater to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night. God made the  stars also and placed them in the heavens to throw light upon the earth.  And God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and a morning,  making the fourth day.    And God said, \"Let the waters bring forth many living creatures and let  birds fly above the earth and in the sky.\" And God made large  sea-monsters and all kinds of living creatures with which the waters  abound, and all kinds of birds. And God saw that it was good. And he  blessed them, saying, \"Increase and fill the waters in the seas, and let  the birds increase on the earth.\" And there was an evening and a  morning, making the fifth day.    And God said, \"Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures,  cattle and creeping things and wild beasts.\" And it was done. So God  made all the different kinds of wild beasts, and the cattle, and  everything that crawls upon the ground. And God saw that it was good.    And God said, \"Let us make man like ourselves. Let him rule over the  fish in the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the wild beasts and  all the living things that crawl upon the ground.\" And God made man like  himself, like God he made him. He made them male and female.    And God blessed them, and said to them, \"Have children, increase, live  all over the earth, and conquer it; rule over the fish of the sea, the  birds of the sky, and over every living thing that crawls upon the  ground.\"    And God said, \"See, to you I give every plant which grows on all the  earth, and every tree which bears fruit with its own kind of seed. It  shall be food for you. And to every wild beast and to every bird of the  sky and to every thing that crawls on the earth and is alive, I give  every green herb for food.\" And it was done.    And when God saw everything that he had made, he saw that it was very  good. And there was an evening and a morning, making the sixth day.    And the heavens and the earth were finished and all that there was in  them. And on the seventh day when God had finished the work which he had  done, he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and  made it holy, for in it he rested from all the work which he had done.          GOD'S GOOD GIFTS TO MAN      At the time when Jehovah made earth and heaven, no trees or plants grew  on the earth, for Jehovah had not yet sent the rain; and there was no  man to till the soil; but a mist rose from the earth and watered the  ground.    Then Jehovah made man out of dust taken from the ground and breathed  into him the breath of life; and man became a living being. And Jehovah  planted a garden in Eden, far in the East; and out of the ground he made  grow all kinds of trees that are pleasant to look at and good for food,  also the tree of life and the tree that gives the knowledge of good and  evil.    Then Jehovah took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it  and to care for it. And Jehovah gave the man this command: \"You may eat  all you wish from every tree of the garden, except from the tree that  gives the knowledge of good and evil; from this you shall not eat, for  if you eat from it you shall surely die.\"    Then Jehovah said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make  a companion for him.\" So out of the ground Jehovah made all the wild  beasts and birds, and brought them to the man to see what he would name  them; and whatever he called each living thing that became its name. But  for the man himself there was found no companion suited to him.    Then Jehovah made the man fall into a deep sleep; and while he slept, he  took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. The rib which  he had taken from the man, Jehovah made into a woman and brought her to  the man. Then the man said, \"Because she was made from my body, she  shall be called Woman.\"          THE FIRST DISOBEDIENCE      Now the serpent was more deceitful than any other animal that Jehovah  had made; and it said to the woman, \"Has God really said, 'You shall not  eat from any tree of the garden'?\" The woman answered, \"We may eat of  the fruit of all the trees of the garden except the fruit of the tree  which is in the middle of the garden, for God has said, 'You shall not  eat from it, nor shall you touch it; for if you do, you shall die.'\"  Then the serpent said to the woman, \"You shall not surely die; for God  knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you  will know what is good and what is evil.\"    When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, beautiful to look at  and that it would make her wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it.  Then she gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.    Then the eyes of both of them were opened, so that they knew that they  were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together and made girdles for  themselves. When they heard the sound of the footsteps of Jehovah, as he  was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, the man and his wife  hid from him among the trees of the garden.    And Jehovah called to the man and said to him, \"Where are you?\" and he  answered, \"I heard the sound of thy footsteps in the garden and I was  afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.\" Jehovah said, \"Who told  you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I  forbade you to eat?\" The man answered, \"The woman whom thou didst give  to me--she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate.\" Jehovah said to the  woman, \"What is this that you have done?\" The woman replied, \"The  serpent deceived me, and I ate.\"    Then Jehovah said to the serpent, \"Because you have done this, you shall  be hated more than all beasts. You shall crawl on your belly and eat  dust all your life, and men and serpents shall always be enemies. They  shall bruise your head, and you shall wound them on the heel.\"    To the woman he said, \"I will greatly increase your trouble and your  pain, and you shall be subject to your husband, and he shall rule over  you.\"    But to the man he said, \"Because you have listened to your wife and have  eaten of the tree from which I forbade you to eat, as long as you live  you shall earn a living only by hard work. By hard work shall you raise  food to eat. And you shall die and your body go back to the ground, for  from dust you were made, and to dust you shall return!\"    And Jehovah made garments of skins for the man and his wife, and clothed  them. And he sent them out of the garden of Eden to till the ground.          CAIN AND HIS BROTHER ABEL      Adam named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living  beings. She had two sons, Cain and Abel. Abel was a shepherd, but Cain  was a farmer.    One day Cain brought, as an offering to Jehovah, some fruit and grain  that he had grown. Abel, too, brought some of the best animals of his  flock and sacrificed their fat pieces to Jehovah. Jehovah"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#3)"],[1,"are directly derived  all our most impressive early buildings, called, as you know, by various  antiquaries, Saxon, Norman, or Romanesque. Now the first point I wish to  insist upon is, that the Greek system, considered merely as a piece of  construction, is weak and barbarous compared with the two others. For  instance, in the case of a large window or door, such as _fig._ 1, if  you have at your disposal a single large and long stone you may indeed  roof it in the Greek manner, as you have done here, with comparative  security; but it is always expensive to obtain and to raise to their  place stones of this large size, and in many places nearly impossible to  obtain them at all: and if you have not such stones, and still insist  upon roofing the space in the Greek way, that is to say, upon having a  square window, you must do it by the miserably feeble adjustment of  bricks, _fig._ 3.[3] You are well aware, of course, that this latter is  the usual way in which such windows are now built in England; you are  fortunate enough here in the north to be able to obtain single stones,  and this circumstance alone gives a considerable degree of grandeur to  your buildings. But in all cases, and however built, you cannot but see  in a moment that this cross bar is weak and imperfect. It may be strong  enough for all immediate intents and purposes, but it is not so strong  as it might be: however well the house is built, it will still not stand  so long as if it had been better constructed; and there is hardly a day  passes but you may see some rent or flaw in bad buildings of this kind.  You may see one whenever you choose, in one of your most costly, and  most ugly buildings, the great church with the dome, at the end of  George Street. I think I never saw a building with a principal entrance  so utterly ghastly and oppressive; and it is as weak as it is ghastly.  The huge horizontal lintel above the door is already split right  through. But you are not aware of a thousandth part of the evil: the  pieces of building that you _see_ are all carefully done; it is in the  parts that are to be concealed by paint and plaster that the bad  building of the day is thoroughly committed. The main mischief lies in  the strange devices that are used to support the long horizontal cross  beams of our larger apartments and shops, and the framework of unseen  walls; girders and ties of cast iron, and props and wedges, and laths  nailed and bolted together, on marvelously scientific principles; so  scientific, that every now and then, when some tender reparation is  undertaken by the unconscious householder, the whole house crashes into  a heap of ruin, so total, that the jury which sits on the bodies of the  inhabitants cannot tell what has been the matter with it, and returns a  dim verdict of accidental death.    [Footnote 3: Plate I. On this subject, see \"The Builder,\" vol. xi.  p. 709.]    7. Did you read the account of the proceedings at the Crystal Palace at  Sydenham the other day? Some dozen of men crushed up among the splinters  of the scaffolding in an instant, nobody knew why. All the engineers  declare the scaffolding to have been erected on the best  principles,--that the fall of it is as much a mystery as if it had  fallen from heaven, and were all meteoric stones. The jury go to  Sydenham and look at the heap of shattered bolts and girders, and come  back as wise as they went. Accidental death! Yes, verily; the lives of  all those dozen of men had been hanging for months at the mercy of a  flaw in an inch or two of cast iron. Very accidental indeed! Not the  less pitiable. I grant it not to be an easy thing to raise scaffolding  to the height of the Crystal Palace without incurring some danger, but  that is no reason why your houses should all be nothing but scaffolding.  The common system of support of walls over shops is now nothing but  permanent scaffolding; part of iron, part of wood, part of brick; in  its skeleton state awful to behold; the weight of three or four stories  of wall resting sometimes on two or three pillars of the size of gas  pipes, sometimes on a single cross beam of wood, laid across from party  wall to party wall in the Greek manner. I have a vivid recollection at  this moment of a vast heap of splinters in the Borough Road, close to  St. George's, Southwark, in the road between my own house and London. I  had passed it the day before, a goodly shop front, and sufficient house  above, with a few repairs undertaken in the shop before opening a new  business. The master and mistress had found it dusty that afternoon, and  went out to tea. When they came back in the evening, they found their  whole house in the form of a heap of bricks blocking the roadway, with a  party of men digging out their cook. But I do not insist on casualties  like these, disgraceful to us as they are, for it is, of course,  perfectly possible to build a perfectly secure house or a secure window  in the Greek manner; but the simple fact is, that in order to obtain in  the cross lintel the same amount of strength which you can obtain in a  pointed arch, you must go to an immensely greater cost in stone or in  labor. Stonehenge is strong enough, but it takes some trouble to build  in the manner of Stonehenge: and Stonehenge itself is not so strong as  an arch of the Colosseum. You could not raise a circle of four  Stonehenges, one over the other, with safety; and as it is, more of the  cross-stones are fallen upon the plain of Sarum than arches rent away,  except by the hand of man, from the mighty circle of Rome. But I waste  words;--your own common sense must show you in a moment that this is a  weak form; and there is not at this instant a single street in London  where some house could not be pointed out with a flaw running through  its brickwork, and repairs rendered necessary in consequence, merely  owing to the adoption of this bad form; and that our builders know so  well, that in myriads of instances you find them actually throwing  concealed arches above the horizontal lintels to take the weight off  them; and the gabled decoration, at the top of some Palladian windows,  is merely the ornamental form resulting from a bold device of the old  Roman builders to effect the same purpose.    8. But there is a farther reason for our adopting the pointed arch than  its being the strongest form; it is also the most beautiful form in  which a window or door-head can be built. Not the most beautiful because  it is the strongest; but most beautiful, because its form is one of  those which, as we know by its frequent occurrence in the work of Nature  around us, has been appointed by the Deity to be an everlasting source  of pleasure to the human mind.    [Illustration: PLATE III. (Fig. 4., Fig. 6.)]    Gather a branch from any of the trees or flowers to which the earth owes  its principal beauty. You will find that every one of its leaves is  terminated, more or less, in the form of the pointed arch; and to that  form owes its grace and character. I will take, for instance, a spray of  the tree which so gracefully adorns your Scottish glens and crags--there  is no lovelier in the world--the common ash. Here is a sketch of the  clusters of leaves which form the extremity of one of its young shoots  (_fig._ 4); and, by the way, it will furnish us with an interesting  illustration of another error in modern architectural systems. You know  how fond modern architects, like foolish modern politicians, are of  their equalities, and similarities; how necessary they think it that  each part of a building should be like every other part. Now Nature  abhors equality, and similitude, just as much as foolish men love them.  You will find that the ends of the shoots of the ash are composed of  four[4] green stalks bearing leaves, springing in the form of a cross,  if seen from above, as in _fig._ 5, Plate I., and at first you will  suppose the four arms of the cross are equal. But look more closely, and  you will find that two opposite arms or stalks have only five leaves  each, and the other two have seven; or else, two have seven, and the  other two nine; but always one pair of stalks has two leaves more than  the other pair. Sometimes the tree gets a little puzzled, and forgets  which is to be the longest stalk, and begins with a stem for seven  leaves where it should have nine, and then recollects itself at the last  minute, and puts on another leaf in a great hurry, and so produces a  stalk with eight leaves; but all this care it takes merely to keep  itself out of equalities; and all its grace and power of pleasing are  owing to its doing so, together with the lovely curves in which its  stalks, thus arranged, spring from the main bough. _Fig._ 5 is a plan of  their arrangement merely, but _fig._ 4 is the way in which you are most  likely to see them: and observe, they spring from the stalk _precisely  as a Gothic vaulted roof springs_, each stalk representing a rib of the  roof, and the leaves its crossing stones; and the beauty of each of  those leaves is altogether owing to its terminating in the Gothic form,  the pointed arch. Now do you think you would have liked your ash trees  as well, if Nature had taught them Greek, and shown them how to grow  according to the received Attic architectural rules of right? I will try  you. Here is a cluster of ash leaves, which I have grown expressly for  you on Greek principles (_fig._ 6, Plate III.) How do you like it?    [Footnote 4: Sometimes of six; that is to say, they spring in pairs;  only the two uppermost pairs, sometimes the three uppermost, spring so  close together as to appear one cluster.]    9. Observe, I have played you no trick in this comparison. It is  perfectly fair in all respects. I have merely substituted for the  beautiful spring of the Gothic vaulting in the ash bough, a cross  lintel; and then, in order to raise the leaves to the same height, I  introduce"]]]
