His wife was in no condition to discuss the  matter, poor lady! My suggestion was that he should bring up both the  children as if they were his own, until one or other of them develops  this likeness that I was speaking of.\"    \"I suppose that is the best thing they can do, doctor; but it will be an  awful business if, as they grow up, no likeness to anybody can be  detected in either of them.\"    \"Well, major, although at present it does seem an awful thing, it won't  seem so bad at the end, say, of twenty years. They will naturally by  that time be as fond of one as the other. The boys, in fact, will be  like twins; and I suppose the property can be divided in some such way  as it would be were they really in that relation to each other.\"    \"But, you see, doctor,\" one of the captains said, \"Mrs. Humphreys has to  be considered to a certain extent too. It is hard on Mrs. Clinton; but  if she gets both boys she is certain at any rate that one of them is her  son, and Mrs. Humphreys will, by that arrangement, have to lose her  child altogether. That seems to me pretty rough on her.\"    \"Well, she brought it on herself,\" the doctor replied. \"The whole thing  has arisen from her carelessness.\"    \"Do you think it was carelessness, doctor?\" the major asked.    \"That is a matter on which I will give no opinion, major. It is one upon  which one man can form a judgment as well as another. The thing may very  well have happened in the way she describes; and again it may be a very  cunningly devised plot on her part. It is evident she had everything to  gain by such an accident. She would get her child taken off her hands,  educated, and provided for. She would calculate no doubt that she would  be their nurse, and would expect, in return for giving up her claim to  one or other of them, some very distinct monetary advantages. I do not  at all say that the affair was not an accident. Upon the contrary, I  admit that it was an accident which might very well happen under the  circumstances. What I do say is, nothing could have turned out better  for her.\"    Just as tiffin was finished, Captain Clinton's soldier-servant came into  the mess-room with the request that Dr. Parker should go across to his  master's bungalow. \"Well, doctor,\" Captain Clinton said as he entered,  \"in the first place I want you to go up and see my wife, and give her a  sedative or something, for she is terribly upset over this affair; and  in the next place I want to tell you that we have agreed to take your  advice in the matter, and to bring up the two children as our own until  we can make out which of the two is our child; then I want your advice  as to whether they can be weaned without any damage to their health. My  wife is determined upon that point. They shall not be brought up by Mrs.  Humphreys. There is no other woman, is there, in the regiment with a  young baby?\"    The doctor shook his head. \"There are one or two with babies, but not  with babies young enough for her to take to these. It would certainly be  far better that they should have the natural nourishment, but I do not  say that they would necessarily suffer from being weaned. Still, you  see, Clinton, there is a question whether this woman will consent to  part with both the children.\"    \"I quite see that, doctor, and of course I shall be ready to make any  money arrangements that will content her.\"    \"I would see the husband, if I were you,\" the doctor said. \"He is a  steady, well-conducted young fellow, and however this matter has come  about, I quite acquit him of having any share in it. I think you will  find it more easy to deal with him than his wife. Unfortunately, you  see, there is always a difficulty with adopted children. A father cannot  sell away his rights; he may agree to do so, but if he changes his mind  afterwards he can back out of his agreement. However he may bind himself  never to interfere with it, the fact remains that he has a legal right  to the custody of his child. And though Sergeant Humphreys might keep  any agreement he might make, the mother might give you no end of trouble  afterwards.\"    \"I see all that, doctor, but of the two evils I think the one we propose  is the least. My wife says she could not bear to see this woman about  the children, and I have a good deal of the same feeling myself. At any  rate in her present state of health I wish to spare her all trouble and  anxiety as much as I can, and therefore it is better to buy this woman  off for the present, even though we may have to run the risk of trouble  with her afterwards. Anyhow, something must be done at once. The  children have both been squalling for the last hour, though I believe  that they have had some milk or something given to them. So I had better  send across for Humphreys, the sooner the matter is got over the  better.\"    The young sergeant presently appeared.    \"Sit down, sergeant. I want to have a talk with you over this terribly  painful business. In one respect I quite understand that it is as  painful for you and Mrs. Humphreys as it is for us, but in other  respects you are much better off than I am. Not only do I not know  which is my child, but I do not know which is heir to my estate; which  is, as you will understand, a most serious matter.\"    \"I can quite understand that, sir,\" the sergeant said quietly.    \"The only plan that I can see,\" Captain Clinton went on, \"is that for  the present I shall adopt both children, and shall bring them up as my  own. Probably in time one of them will grow up with some resemblance to  myself or Mrs. Clinton, and the other will show a likeness to you or  your wife. In that case I should propose to finish the education of your  boy, and then to provide for him by putting him into the army, or such  other profession as he may choose; for it would be very unfair after  bringing him up and educating him as my own to turn him adrift. Thus,  you see, in any case my adoption of him would be greatly to his benefit.  I can, of course, thoroughly understand that it will be very hard for  you and Mrs. Humphreys to give up your child. Very hard. And I am quite  ready to make any pecuniary arrangement with you and her that you may  think right. I may say that I do not think that it would be desirable  that Mrs. Humphreys should continue as their nurse. I want to consider  the boys as my own, and her presence would be constantly bringing up  unpleasant remembrances. In the second place I think that it would be  better for her that she should not act as their nurse. She would know  that one of them is her own, and the separation when it came would be  very much more painful than it would be at present. Of course I do not  expect an answer from you just at this moment. You will naturally wish  to talk it over with her, but I shall be glad if you will let us have an  answer as soon as you can, as it is necessary that we should obtain  another nurse without loss of time.\"    \"What you say seems to me very fair, Captain Clinton,\" the sergeant  said. \"I would give anything, sir, that this shouldn't have happened. I  would rather have shot myself first. I can answer for myself, sir, that  I accept your offer. Of course, I am sorry to lose the child; but a  baby is not much to a man till it gets to know him and begins to talk,  and it will be a satisfaction to know that he is in good hands, with a  far better look-out than I could have given him. I will see my wife,  sir, and let you know in half an hour.\"    \"Do you think that she will consent, Humphreys?\"    \"I am sure she will,\" the sergeant said briefly, and then added, \"There  is nothing else she could do,\" and saluting he went out of the room.    \"He suspects his wife of having done it on purpose,\" Dr. Parker said,  speaking for the first time since the sergeant had entered the room. \"I  don't say he knows it, but he suspects it. Did you notice how decidedly  he said that she would consent? And I fancy up to now she has had her  own way in everything.\"    \"Well, what do they say?\" Mrs. Humphreys asked as her husband entered  the door. He told her shortly the offer that had been made. She laughed  scornfully. \"A likely thing that! So they are to have both children, and  I am not to be allowed even to see them; and they are to pick and choose  as to which they like to say is theirs, and we are to be shouldered out  of it altogether! It is just as bad for me not to know which is my boy  as it is for that woman; but they are to take the whole settlement of  things in their hands, my feelings to go for nothing. Of course you told  them that you would not let them do such a thing?\"    \"I did not tell them anything of the sort. I told them that I accepted  their proposal, and that I could answer for your accepting it too.\"    \"Then you were never more wrong in your life, John Humphreys!\" she said  angrily; \"I won't consent to anything of the sort. Luck has thrown a  good thing in our hands, and I mean to make the most of it. We ought to  get enough out of this to make us comfortable for life if we work it  well. I did not think that you were such a soft!\"    \"Soft or not soft, it is going to be done as they propose,\" her husband  said doggedly. \"It is burden enough as it is--we have lost our child.  Not that I care so very much about that; there will be time enough for  more, and children do not add to the comfort of close little quarters  like these. But whether we like it or not, we have lost the child. In  the next place we shall never hear the end of it in the regiment, and I  shall see if I cannot manage to get transferred to another. There will  be no standing the talk there will be.\"    \"Let them talk!\" his wife said scornfully. \"What do we care about their  talk!\"    \"I care a great deal,\" he said. \"And I tell you why, because I know what  they will say is true.\"    \"What do you mean?\" she asked quickly.    \"I mean, Jane, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22009"],[0,"Hinemoa (#3)"],[1," slave.    _Mokoia_, the island in Rotorua.    _Moku_, for me.    _Momoe_, sleep together; marriage.    _Mona_, for him or her.    _Muri_, after.    _Mutu_, end; finish.    _Na_, denoting position near person spoken to.

It would only confuse the student if the full meaning of every  word were given. The letter _A_, has 4 meanings given. The first meaning  is And; _a whakarongo mai hoki_, '_and_ also listen.' The second use is  before a proper name. _A Tuwharetoa_. The third is _a Tutanekai Nga pu  a Tutanekai_. 'The instruments of Tutanekai.' Fourth, _a ka mutu te  ngenge_ etc. (_lit._) 'At length, the weariness of her shoulders ended.'  These meanings of _A_ are sufficient for the text. The meanings of the  letter _A_ given by the late Rev. Colenso, are no less than sixteen,  main division. Some of these again divide into twelve, fourteen, or more  shades of meaning.    I ask the indulgence of Maori scholars in regard to the arrangement of  _Wh_. In the larger Dictionaries \"_Whakaae_\" is given with _Ae_.  \"_Whakaaro_\" with _Aro_. For convenience I have ventured to arrange all  the causatives (\"_Whaka_\") under _Wh_.           *        *       *       *       *    _Printed by Whitcombe and Tombs Limited, Christchurch._ G14309      Transcriber's note:    The book on which this e-text is based was printed before macrons were  introduced into Maori to distinguish long vowels from short ones.
