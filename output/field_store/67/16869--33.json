When the meat is a good brown color, add some fresh or canned  tomatoes or half a tablespoonful of tomato paste and simmer slowly until  all has cooked down to a thick creamy sauce. It will probably take 3/4  hour. The sauce may be bound together with a little flour if it shows a  tendency to separate.    This sauce is used to dress all kinds of macaroni and spaghetti, also  for boiled rice (see Risotto). The macaroni or spaghetti should be left  unbroken when cooked. If they are too long to fit in the kettle immerse  one end in the boiling salted water and in a very few minutes the ends  of the spaghetti under the water will become softened so that the rest  can be pushed down into the kettle. Be careful not to overcook it, and  it will not be pasty, but firm and tender. Drain it carefully and put in  a hot soup tureen. Sprinkle a handful of grated cheese over it and pour  on the sauce. Lift with two forks until thoroughly mixed.      21    MACARONI FRIED WITH OIL    (Maccheroni all'olio)    After the macaroni have boiled drain them and put them in a saucepan in  which some good olive oil has already boiled, with a clove of garlic  chopped fine. Let the paste fry, taking care that it doesn't stick to  the bottom of the saucepan, and when it is well browned on one side,  turn it to have the other side browned. Serve the macaroni very hot. Add  no cheese.      22    RISOTTO MILANAISE    (Risotto alla Milanese)    Melt a small piece of butter in a saucepan. Brown in the butter a medium  sized onion, cut in thin slices. When the onion is browned, take it away  from the saucepan and add little by little the rice, stirring it with a  wooden spoon. Every time that the rice becomes dry, add some hot broth  (or hot water) until the rice is completely cooked. Add salt and pepper  and a little saffron, if you like it.    When the rice is almost cooked, add to it some brown stock. Dress with  parmesan cheese and some butter. Mix well and serve hot. This dish must  not be allowed to be overcooked or cooled before eating.      23    RISOTTO WITH CHICKEN GIBLETS    (Risotto alla Milanese II)    The broth for this risotto may be made by cooking together the giblets,  neck and tips of wings of a chicken which is to be roasted, or it may be  made from the left-overs of roast fowl.    Boil the rice until it is about half done in salted water. Then let the  water cook away and begin adding the broth, in such quantity that the  rice will be nearly dry when it is tender. Fry one chopped onion in the  oil or fat. Some mushrooms cut up small are a very good addition to this  \"=Soffritto=\". Mince the chicken giblets and add to the onion. Stir the  mixture into the rice. Add grated cheese and a beaten egg just as the  rice is taken from the fire.      24    (Risotto con piselli)    Wash and dry 1-1/2 lb. rice; chop fine one medium sized onion and put it  on the fire with a small quantity of butter.    When the onion is well browned, add the rice little by little, stirring  with a wooden spoon. Add some boiling water one cup at a time. Drain the  peas previously prepared (fresh or canned peas may be used) and add them  toward the end of the cooking. When the whole is almost cooked, add some  salt and take it away from the water almost dry. Add some butter, stir  and serve hot.      25    RISOTTO WITH LOBSTER    (Risotto coi gamberi)    For this risotto either lobster or crab meat can be used: the former is,  however, considered more tasty. The lobster or crab meat ought to be  about half the weight of the rice employed. A little more than a pound  of rice and half this weight of crab meat ought to be enough for six  persons.    Chop fine a sprig of parsley, a stalk of celery, one carrot, half an  onion a clove of garlic and brown the whole in good olive oil. When  browned, add the crab meat and season with salt and pepper. During the  cooking process stir and turn over the crabs, and when they have become  red, pour over as much hot water as is necessary to cook the rice.    After the water boils for a while, remove the lobster (or crab, or  craw-fish) leaving the saucepan on the fire. Put half of the crabs  aside, and grind the rest. Rub the ground meat through the sieve and put  it back on the fire. In another saucepan melt some butter and put into  it little by little the rice that has been washed and dried. Stir and  add the broth from the first saucepan. When the rice is almost cooked  add the craw-fish that you have put aside, or rather its meat extracted  from the shells, take from the fire and pour over it the fish mixture,  adding some grated cheese.      26    RICE WITH SAFFRON    (Riso alla Milanese con Zafferano)    Wash and dry the rice and put it in boiling broth (beef or chicken  broth). When the rice is half cooked add half its weight of marrow of  beef bone, cut into small pieces. A few minutes are sufficient for the  cooking of the marrow. Add grated cheese and remove the kettle from the  fire.    Dissolve some saffron in one or two tablespoonfuls of broth; sift it  through a sieve and mix with rice, which is to be served very hot, and  makes an excellent soup.      27    RICE CAKES    (Frittelle di riso)    Cook the rice in milk, adding a small quantity of butter, some salt,  half a teaspoon of sugar and just a taste of lemon peel. Let the rice  cool down after being thoroughly cooked, then add three yolks of eggs  (for 1/4 lb. of rice) and some flour. Mix well and let the whole rest  for several hours. When about to fry, beat the white of the eggs to a  froth, add to the rice mixing slowly, and put into the saucepan with a  ladle.      28    FRIED ARTICHOKE    (Carciofi fritti)    Take two artichokes, cut out the hard part of the leaves and of the  stalk, cut them in two. Then cut these halves into section or slices so  as to have eight or ten for each artichoke, according to size. As you  cut them, throw them into cold water and when they are well washed, dry  them, but not thoroughly, putting them at once into the flour so that  the latter remains attached to it. Beat the white of an egg, but not to  a froth, then mix the yolk with the white and salt the whole. Shake out  the artichokes to take away the superfluous flour and then put them in  the egg, leaving them for a while so that the egg may be attached to  them.    Throw the pieces one by one into the pan where there is boiling fat,  butter or olive oil, and when they are well browned, take them away and  serve with lemon. If it is desired that the artichokes remain white, it  is better to fry them in oil and to squeeze half lemon into the water  where the artichokes are put to soften.      29    STEAMED ARTICHOKES    (Carciofi a vapore)    Artichokes have been only recently imported to the United States,  principally by Italian farmers, and they are just beginning to find  their way into the American kitchen. The artichokes may be eaten raw or  cooked. It is a healthy and palatable vegetable, easily digested when  cooked. It is nutritious and adapted for convalescents. It may be  prepared in a thousand ways, and here follow some of the simplest and  most tasteful.    To prepare the steamed artichokes they must first be cleaned and the  stalk cut to less than half an inch. Put them in a saucepan, standing on  their bottoms, one near the other, in half an inch or more of water. In  an opening made in the middle put salt and pepper, and pour inside as  much good olive oil as they may contain. Cover well the saucepan and put  it on the fire. The artichokes, that are already seasoned, will be  cooked by the steam.      30    STEWED ARTICHOKES    (Carciofi in stufato)    Wash the artichokes and cut the hard part of the leaves (the top). Widen  the leaves and insert a hash composed of bread crumbs, parsley, salt,  pepper and oil. Place the artichokes in the saucepan standing on their  stalk, one touching the other. Cover them with water and let them cook  for two hours or more. When the leaves are easily detached they are  cooked.      31    ARTICHOKES WITH BUTTER    (Carciofi al burro)    Wash, dry and cut out the top of the leaves of as many artichokes as are  needed. Cut them in two or four and boil them in salt water. When  tender, drain them, have them slightly browned in melted butter and  season with salt and pepper.    When served in a vegetable dish or placed in a pyramid on a round plate,  sprinkle with grated cheese.      32    FRIED SQUASH    (Zucchine fritte)    The squashes used by Italians for frying and other purposes are very  small, and for this reason they are called \"Zucchine\" or small squashes.  They can be bought at those shops kept by Italian vegetable dealers that  are now to be found in large number in most American cities and,  invariably, in Italian neighborhoods during the summer season. The  \"Zucchine\" are an extremely tasty vegetable and they are especially good  when fried.    Select the squashes that are long and thin: wash them cut them in little  strips less than half an inch thick. Take away the softer part of the  interior and salt moderately. Leave them aside for an hour or two, then  drain them but don't dry them. Put them in flour and rub gently in a  sieve to take away the superfluous flour: immediately after put them in  a saucepan where there is already oil, fat or butter boiling. At the  beginning don't touch them to avoid breaking, and only when they have  become a little hardened stir them and remove when they begin to be  browned.      33    LAMB OMELET    (Agnello in frittata)    Cut in little pieces a loin of lamb, which is the part that lends itself  best for this dish, and fry in lard: a little quantity of lard is  sufficient, because the meat of the loins is rather fat.

The bird is placed among conditions especially  unfavorable.    _The Senses of Insects._ The eyes of insects are sometimes so large as  to envelop the head like an Elizabethan ruffle, and the creature's head,  as in the common house fly, seems all eyes. And this is almost literally  the case, as the two great staring eyes that almost meet on the top of  the head to form one, are made up of myriads of simple eyes. Each facet  or simple eye is provided with a nerve filament which branches off from  the main optic nerve, so that but one impression of the object perceived  is conveyed to the brain; though it is taught by some that objects  appear not only double but a thousand times multiplied. But we should  remember that with our two eyes we see double only when the brain is  diseased. Besides the large ordinary compound eyes, many insects possess  small, simple eyes, like those of the spider. The great German  anatomist, Johannes Mueller, believed that the compound eyes were adapted  for the perception of distant objects, while those nearer are seen by  the simple eyes. But it may be objected to this view that the spiders,  which have only simple eyes, apparently see both near and remote objects  as well as insects.    The sense of touch is diffused all over the body. As in the hairs of the  head and face of man, those of insects are delicate tactile organs; and  on the antennae and legs (insects depending on this sense rather than  that of sight) these appendages are covered with exquisitely fine  hairs. It is thought by some that the senses of hearing and smell are  lodged in the antennae, these organs thus combining the sense of feeling  with those of hearing and smelling. And the researches of anatomists  lend much probability to the assertion, since little pits just under the  skin are found, and even sometimes provided with grains of sand in the  so-called ear of the lobster, etc., corresponding to the ear bones of  the higher animals, the pits being connected with nerves leading to the  brain. We have detected similar pits in the under side of the palpi of  the Perla. It seems not improbable that these are organs of smell, and  placed in that part of the appendage nearest the mouth, so as to enable  the insect to select its proper food by its odor. Similar organs exist  on the caudal appendages of a kind of fly (Chrysopila), while the long,  many-jointed caudal filaments of the cockroach are each provided with  nearly a hundred of these little pits, which seem to be so many noses.  Thus Lespes, a Swiss anatomist, in his remarks on the auditory sacs,  which he says are found in the antennae of nearly all insects, declares  that as we have in insects compound eyes, so we have compound ears. We  might add that in the abdominal appendage of the cockroach we have a  compound nose, while in the feelers of the Perla, and the caudal  appendage of the Chrysopila, the \"nose\" is simple. We might also refer  here to Siebold's discovery of ears at the base of the abdomen of some,  and in the forelegs of other kinds, of grasshoppers. Thus we need not be  surprised at finding ears and noses scattered, as it were, sometimes  almost wantonly over the bodies of insects (in many worms the eyes are  found all over the body), while in man and his allies, from the monkey  down to the fish, the ears and nose invariably retain the same relative  place in the head.    _How Insects Grow._ When beginning our entomological studies no fact  seemed more astonishing to our boyish mind than the thought that the  little flies and midges were not the sons and daughters of the big  ones. If every farmer and gardener knew this single fact it would be  worth their while. The words _larva_ and _pupa_ will frequently occur in  subsequent pages, and they should be explained. The caterpillar (Fig.  14, _a_) represents the earliest stage or babyhood of the butterfly, and  it is called _larva_, from the Latin, meaning a mask, because it was  thought by the ancients to mask the form of the adult butterfly.    [Illustration: 14. _a_ Larva, _b_ chrysalis of a butterfly.]    When the caterpillar has ended its riotous life, for its appetite almost  transforms its being into the very incarnation of gluttony, it suddenly,  as if repenting of its former life as a _bon vivant_, seeks a solitary  cell or hole where like a hermit it sits and leads apparently about as  useless an existence. But meanwhile strange processes are going on  beneath the skin; and after a few convulsive struggles the back splits  open, and out wriggles the chrysalis, a gorgeous, mummy-like form, its  body adorned with golden and silvery spots. Hence the word chrysalis  (Fig. 14, _b_), from the Greek, meaning golden, while the Latin word  _pupa_, meaning a baby or doll, is indicative of its youth. In this  state it hangs suspended to a twig or other object; while the silk worm,  and others of its kind, previous to moulting, or casting their skins,  spin a silken cocoon, which envelops and protects the chrysalis.    [Illustration: 15. Imago or adult Butterfly.]    At the given time, and after the body of the adult has fully formed  beneath the chrysalis skin, there is another moult, and the butterfly,  with baggy, wet wings, creeps out. The body dries, the skin hardens, the  wings expand, and in a few moments, sometimes an hour, the butterfly  (Fig. 15) proudly sails aloft, the glory and pride of the insect world.    We shall see in the ensuing chapters how varied are the larvae and pupae  of insects, and under what different guises insects live in their early  stages.    [Illustration: Larva, pupa, and adult of a Leaf Beetle (Galeruca).]          OUR COMMON INSECTS.          CHAPTER I.    THE HOME OF THE BEES.      The history of the Honey bee, its wonderful instincts, its elaborate  cells and complex economy, have engrossed the attention of the best  observers, even from the time of Virgil, who sang of the Ligurian bee.  The literature of the art of bee-keeping is already very extensive.  Numerous bee journals and manuals of bee-keeping testify to the  importance of this art, while able mathematicians have studied the mode  of formation of the hexagonal cells,[1] and physiologists have  investigated the intricate problems of the mode of generation and  development of the bee itself.    In discussing these difficult questions, we must rise from the study of  the simple to the complex, remembering that--      \"All nature widens upward. Evermore    The simpler essence lower lies:    More complex is more perfect--owning more    Discourse, more widely wise.\"    and not forget to study the humbler allies of the Honey bee. We shall,  in observing the habits and homes of the wild bees, gain a clearer  insight into the mysteries of the hive.    The great family of bees is divided into social and solitary species.  The social kinds live in nests composed of numerous cells in which the  young brood are reared. These cells vary in form from those which are  quite regularly hexagonal, like those of the Hive bee, to those which  are less regularly six-sided, as in the stingless bee of the tropics  (Melipona), until in the Humble bee the cells are isolated and  cylindrical in form.    Before speaking of the wild bees, let us briefly review the life of the  Honey bee. The queen bee having wintered over with many workers, lays  her eggs in the spring, first in the worker, and, at a later period, in  the drone-cells. Early in the summer the workers construct the large,  flask-shaped queen-cells, which are placed on the edge of the comb, and  in these the queen larvae are fed with rich and choice food. The old  queen deserts the nest, forming a new colony. The new-born queen takes  her marriage flight high in the air with a drone, and on her return  undertakes the management of the hive, and the duty of laying eggs. When  the supply of queens is exhausted, the workers destroy the drones. The  first brood of workers live about six weeks in summer, and then give way  to a new brood. The queens, according to Von Berlepsch, are known to  live five years, and during their whole life lay more than a million  eggs.    In the tropics, the Honey bee is replaced by the Meliponas and Trigonas.  They are minute, stingless bees, which store up honey and live in  colonies often of immense extent. The cells of Melipona are hexagonal,  nearly approaching in regularity those of the Hive bee, while the honey  cells are irregular, being much larger cavities, which hold about  one-half as much honey as a cell of the Humble bee. \"Gardner, in his  travels, states that many species of Melipona build in the hollow trunks  of trees, others in banks; some suspend their nests from the branches of  trees, whilst one species constructs its nest of clay, it being of large  size.\" (F. Smith.)    In a nest of the coal-black Trigona (Trigona carbonaria), from eastern  Australia, Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum, found from four hundred  to five hundred dead workers, but no females. The combs were arranged  precisely similar to those of the common wasp. The number of honey-pots  which were placed at the foot of the nest was two hundred and fifty. Mr.  Smith inclines to the opinion that the hive of Trigona contains several  prolific females, as the great number of workers can only be thus  explained, and M. Guerin found six females in a nest of the Tawny-footed  Melipona (M. fulvipes).    At home, our nearest ally of the true Honey bee, is the Humble bee  (Bombus), of which over forty species are known to inhabit North  America.    The economy of the Humble bee is thus: the queen awakens in early spring  from her winter's sleep under leaves or moss, or in the last year's  nest, and selects a nesting place, generally in an abandoned nest of a  field-mouse, or beneath a stump or sod, and \"immediately,\" according to  Mr. F. W. Putnam,[2] \"collects\" a small"]]]
