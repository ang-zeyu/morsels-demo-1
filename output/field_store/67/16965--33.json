The night following, the same apparition again presented itself, only,  on this occasion, Francesco Cenci, undressed, entered his daughter's  roam and invited her to join the fete. Hardly knowing what she did,  Beatrice yet perceived the impropriety of yielding to her father's  wishes: she replied that, not seeing her stepmother, Lucrezia Petroni,  among all these women, she dared not leave her bed to mix with persons  who were unknown to her. Francesco threatened and prayed, but threats  and prayers were of no avail. Beatrice wrapped herself up in the  bedclothes, and obstinately refused to obey.    The next night she threw herself on her bed without undressing. At the  accustomed hour the door opened, and the nocturnal spectacle reappeared.  This time, Lucrezia Petroni was among the women who passed before  Beatrice's door; violence had compelled her to undergo this humiliation.  Beatrice was too far off to see her blushes and her tears. Francesco  pointed out her stepmother, whom she had lacked for in vain the previous  evening; and as she could no longer make any opposition, he led her,  covered with blushes and confusion, into the middle of this orgy.    Beatrice there saw incredible and infamous things....    Nevertheless, she resisted a long time: an inward voice told her that  this was horrible; but Francesco had the slaw persistence of a demon. To  these sights, calculated to stimulate her passions, he added heresies  designed to warp her mind; he told her that the greatest saints  venerated by the Church were the issue of fathers and daughters, and in  the end Beatrice committed a crime without even knowing it to be a sin.    His brutality then knew no bounds. He forced Lucrezia and Beatrice to  share the same bed, threatening his wife to kill her if she disclosed to  his daughter by a single word that there was anything odious in such an  intercourse. So matters went on for about three years.    At this time Francesco was obliged to make a journey, and leave the  women alone and free. The first thing Lucrezia did was to enlighten  Beatrice an the infamy of the life they were leading; they then together  prepared a memorial to the pope, in which they laid before him a  statement of all the blows and outrages they had suffered. But, before  leaving, Francesco Cenci had taken precautions; every person about the  pope was in his pay, or hoped to be. The petition never reached His  Holiness, and the two poor women, remembering that Clement VIII had on a  farmer occasion driven Giacomo, Cristaforo, and Rocco from his presence,  thought they were included in the same proscription, and looked upon  themselves as abandoned to their fate.    When matters were in this state, Giacomo, taking advantage of his  father's absence, came to pay them a visit with a friend of his, an abbe  named Guerra: he was a young man of twenty-five or twenty-six, belonging  to one of the most noble families in Rome, of a bold, resolute, and  courageous character, and idolised by all the Roman ladies for his  beauty. To classical features he added blue eyes swimming in poetic  sentiment; his hair was long and fair, with chestnut beard and eyebrows;  add to these attractions a highly educated mind, natural eloquence  expressed by a musical and penetrating voice, and the reader may form  some idea of Monsignor the Abbe Guerra.    No sooner had he seen Beatrice than he fell in love with her. On her  side, she was not slow to return the sympathy of the young priest. The  Council of Trent had not been held at that time, consequently  ecclesiastics were not precluded from marriage. It was therefore decided  that on the return of Francesco the Abbe Guerra should demand the hand  of Beatrice from her father, and the women, happy in the absence of  their master, continued to live on, hoping for better things to come.    After three or four months, during which no one knew where he was,  Francesco returned. The very first night, he wished to resume his  intercourse with Beatrice; but she was no longer the same person, the  timid and submissive child had become a girl of decided will; strong in  her love for the abbe, she resisted alike prayers, threats, and blows.    The wrath of Francesco fell upon his wife, whom he accused of betraying  him; he gave her a violent thrashing. Lucrezia Petroni was a veritable  Roman she-wolf, passionate alike in love and vengeance; she endured all,  but pardoned nothing.    Some days after this, the Abbe Guerra arrived at the Cenci palace to  carry out what had been arranged. Rich, young, noble, and handsome,  everything would seem to promise him success; yet he was rudely  dismissed by Francesco. The first refusal did not daunt him; he returned  to the charge a second time and yet a third, insisting upon the  suitableness of such a union. At length Francesco, losing patience, told  this obstinate lover that a reason existed why Beatrice could be neither  his wife nor any other man's. Guerra demanded what this reason was.  Francesco replied:    \"Because she is my mistress.\"    Monsignor Guerra turned pale at this answer, although at first he did  not believe a word of it; but when he saw the smile with which Francesco  Cenci accompanied his words, he was compelled to believe that, terrible  though it was, the truth had been spoken.    For three days he sought an interview with Beatrice in vain; at length  he succeeded in finding her. His last hope was her denial of this  horrible story: Beatrice confessed all. Henceforth there was no human  hope for the two lovers; an impassable gulf separated them. They parted  bathed in tears, promising to love one another always.    Up to that time the two women had not formed any criminal resolution,  and possibly the tragical incident might never have happened, had not  Frances one night returned into his daughter's room and violently forced  her into the commission of fresh crime.    Henceforth the doom of Francesco was irrevocably pronounced.    As we have said, the mind of Beatrice was susceptible to the best and  the worst influences: it could attain excellence, and descend to guilt.  She went and told her mother of the fresh outrage she had undergone;  this roused in the heart of the other woman the sting of her own wrongs;  and, stimulating each other's desire for revenge, they, decided upon the  murder of Francesco.    Guerra was called in to this council of death. His heart was a prey to  hatred and revenge. He undertook to communicate with Giacomo Cenci,  without whose concurrence the women would not act, as he was the head of  the family, when his father was left out of account.    Giacomo entered readily into the conspiracy. It will be remembered what  he had formerly suffered from his father; since that time he had  married, and the close-fisted old man had left him, with his wife and  children, to languish in poverty. Guerra's house was selected to meet in  and concert matters.    Giacomo hired a sbirro named Marzio, and Guerra a second named Olympio.    Both these men had private reasons for committing the crime--one being  actuated by love, the other by hatred. Marzio, who was in the service of  Giacomo, had often seen Beatrice, and loved her, but with that silent  and hopeless love which devours the soul. When he conceived that the  proposed crime would draw him nearer to Beatrice, he accepted his part  in it without any demur.    As for Olympio, he hated Francesco, because the latter had caused him to  lose the post of castellan of Rocco Petrella, a fortified stronghold in  the kingdom of Naples, belonging to Prince Colonna. Almost every year  Francesco Cenci spent some months at Rocco Petrella with his family; for  Prince Colonna, a noble and magnificent but needy prince, had much  esteem for Francesco, whose purse he found extremely useful. It had so  happened that Francesco, being dissatisfied with Olympio, complained  about him to Prince Colonna, and he was dismissed.    After several consultations between the Cenci family, the abbe and the  sbirri, the following plan of action was decided upon.    The period when Francesco Cenci was accustomed to go to Rocco Petrella  was approaching: it was arranged that Olympio, conversant with the  district and its inhabitants, should collect a party of a dozen  Neapolitan bandits, and conceal them in a forest through which the  travellers would have to pass. Upon a given signal, the whole family  were to be seized and carried off. A heavy ransom was to be demanded,  and the sons were to be sent back to Rome to raise the sum; but, under  pretext of inability to do so, they were to allow the time fixed by the  bandits to lapse, when Francesco was to be put to death. Thus all  suspicions of a plot would be avoided, and the real assassins would  escape justice.    This well-devised scheme was nevertheless unsuccessful. When Francesco  left Rome, the scout sent in advance by the conspirators could not find  the bandits; the latter, not being warned beforehand, failed to come  down before the passage of the travellers, who arrived safe and sound at  Rocco Petreila. The bandits, after having patrolled the road in vain,  came to the conclusion that their prey had escaped, and, unwilling to  stay any longer in a place where they had already spent a week, went off  in quest of better luck elsewhere.    Francesco had in the meantime settled down in the fortress, and, to be  more free to tyrannise over Lucrezia and Beatrice, sent back to Rome  Giacomo and his two other sons. He then recommenced his infamous  attempts upon Beatrice, and with such persistence, that she resolved  herself to accomplish the deed which at first she desired to entrust to  other hands.    Olympio and Marzio, who had nothing to fear from justice, remained  lurking about the castle; one day Beatrice saw them from a window, and  made signs that she had something to communicate to them. The same night  Olympio, who having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#3)"],[1,"then hidden in its depths.    Next day, October 1st, the scenes of tumult were renewed: from early  dawn Captain Bouillargues ran from street to street crying, \"Courage,  comrades! Montpellier, Pezenas, Aramon, Beaucaire, Saint-Andeol, and  Villeneuve are taken, and are on our side. Cardinal de Lorraine is dead,  and the king is in our power.\" This aroused the failing energies of the  assassins. They joined the captain, and demanded that the houses round  the palace should be searched, as it was almost certain that the bishop,  who had, as may be remembered, escaped the day before, had taken refuge  in one of them. This being agreed to, a house-to-house visitation was  begun: when the house of M. de Sauvignargues was reached, he confessed  that the bishop was in his cellar, and proposed to treat with Captain  Bouillargues for a ransom. This proposition being considered reasonable,  was accepted, and after a short discussion the sum of 120 crowns was  agreed on. The bishop laid down every penny he had about him, his  servants were despoiled, and the sum made up by the Sieur de  Sauvignargues, who having the bishop in his house kept him caged. The  prelate, however, made no objection, although under other circumstances  he would have regarded this restraint as the height of impertinence; but  as it was he felt safer in M. de Sauvignargues' cellar than in the  palace.    But the secret of the worthy prelate's hiding place was but badly kept  by those with whom he had treated; for in a few moments a second crowd  appeared, hoping to obtain a second ransom. Unfortunately, the Sieur de  Sauvignargues, the bishop, and the bishop's servants had stripped  themselves of all their ready money to make up the first, so the master  of the house, fearing for his own safety, having barricaded the doors,  got out into a lane and escaped, leaving the bishop to his fate. The  Huguenots climbed in at the windows, crying, \"No quarter! Down with the  Papists!\" The bishop's servants were cut down, the bishop himself  dragged out of the cellar and thrown into the street. There his rings  and crozier were snatched from him; he was stripped of his clothes and  arrayed in a grotesque and ragged garment which chanced to be at hand;  his mitre was replaced by a peasant's cap; and in this condition he was  dragged back to the palace and placed on the brink of the well to be  thrown in. One of the assassins drew attention to the fact that it was  already full. \"Pooh!\" replied another, \"they won't mind a little  crowding for a bishop.\" Meantime the prelate, seeing he need expect no  mercy from man, threw himself on his knees and commended his soul to  God. Suddenly, however, one of those who had shown himself most  ferocious during the massacre, Jean Coussinal by name, was touched as if  by miracle with a feeling of compassion at the sight of so much  resignation, and threw himself between the bishop and those about to  strike, and declaring that whoever touched the prelate must first  overcome himself, took him under his protection, his comrades retreating  in astonishment. Jean Coussinal raising the bishop, carried him in his  arms into a neighbouring house, and drawing his sword, took his stand on  the threshold.    The assassins, however, soon recovered from their surprise, and  reflecting that when all was said and done they were fifty to one,  considered it would be shameful to let themselves be intimidated by a  single opponent, so they advanced again on Coussinal, who with a  back-handed stroke cut off the head of the first-comer. The cries upon  this redoubled, and two or three shots were fired at the obstinate  defender of the poor bishop, but they all missed aim. At that moment  Captain Bouillargues passed by, and seeing one man attacked by fifty,  inquired into the cause. He was told of Coussinal's odd determination to  save the bishop. \"He is quite right,\" said the captain; \"the bishop has  paid ransom, and no one has any right to touch him.\" Saying this, he  walked up to Coussinal, gave him his hand, and the two entered the  house, returning in a few moments with the bishop between them. In this  order they crossed the town, followed by the murmuring crowd, who were,  however, afraid to do more than murmur; at the gate the bishop was  provided with an escort and let go, his defenders remaining there till  he was out of sight.    The massacres went on during the whole of the second day, though towards  evening the search for victims relaxed somewhat; but still many isolated  acts of murder took place during the night. On the morrow, being tired  of killing, the people began to destroy, and this phase lasted a long  time, it being less fatiguing to throw stones about than corpses. All  the convents, all the monasteries, all the houses of the priests and  canons were attacked in turn; nothing was spared except the cathedral,  before which axes and crowbars seemed to lose their power, and the  church of Ste. Eugenie, which was turned into a powder-magazine. The day  of the great butchery was called \"La Michelade,\" because it took place  the day after Michaelmas, and as all this happened in the year 1567 the  Massacre of St. Bartholomew must be regarded as a plagiarism.    At last, however, with the help of M. Damville; the Catholics again got  the upper hand, and it was the turn of the Protestants to fly. They took  refuge in the Cevennes. From the beginning of the troubles the Cevennes  had been the asylum of those who suffered for the Protestant faith; and  still the plains are Papist, and the mountains Protestant. When the  Catholic party is in the ascendant at Nimes, the plain seeks the  mountain; when the Protestants come into power, the mountain comes down  into the plain.    However, vanquished and fugitive though they were, the Calvinists did  not lose courage: in exile one day, they felt sure their luck would turn  the next; and while the Catholics were burning or hanging them in effigy  for contumacy, they were before a notary, dividing the property of their  executioners.    But it was not enough for them to buy or sell this property amongst each  other, they wanted to enter into possession; they thought of nothing  else, and in 1569--that is, in the eighteenth month of their exile--they  attained their wish in the following manner:    One day the exiles perceived a carpenter belonging to a little village  called Cauvisson approaching their place of refuge. He desired to speak  to M. Nicolas de Calviere, seigneur de St. Cosme, and brother of the  president, who was known to be a very enterprising man. To him the  carpenter, whose name was Maduron, made the following proposition:    In the moat of Nimes, close to the Gate of the Carmelites, there was a  grating through which the waters from the fountain found vent. Maduron  offered to file through the bars of this grating in such a manner that  some fine night it could be lifted out so as to allow a band of armed  Protestants to gain access to the city. Nicolas de Calviere approving of  this plan, desired that it should be carried out at once; but the  carpenter pointed out that it would be necessary to wait for stormy  weather, when the waters swollen by the rain would by their noise drown  the sound of the file. This precaution was doubly necessary as the box  of the sentry was almost exactly above the grating. M. de Calviere tried  to make Maduron give way; but the latter, who was risking more than  anyone else, was firm. So whether they liked it or not, de Calviere and  the rest had to await his good pleasure.    Some days later rainy weather set in, and as usual the fountain became  fuller; Maduron seeing that the favourable moment had arrived, glided at  night into the moat and applied his file, a friend of his who was hidden  on the ramparts above pulling a cord attached to Maduron's arm every  time the sentinel, in pacing his narrow round, approached the spot.  Before break of day the work was well begun. Maduron then obliterated  all traces of his file by daubing the bars with mud and wax, and  withdrew. For three consecutive nights he returned to his task, taking  the same precautions, and before the fourth was at an end he found that  by means of a slight effort the grating could be removed. That was all  that was needed, so he gave notice to Messire Nicolas de Calviere that  the moment had arrived.    Everything was favourable to the undertaking: as there was no moon, the  next night was chosen to carry out the plan, and as soon as it was dark  Messire Nicolas de Calviere set out with his men, who, slipping down  into the moat without noise, crossed, the water being up to their belts,  climbed up the other side, and crept along at the foot of the wall till  they reached the grating without being perceived. There Maduron was  waiting, and as soon as he caught sight of them he gave a slight blow to  the loose bars; which fell, and the whole party entered the drain, led  by de Calviere, and soon found themselves at the farther end--that is to  say, in the Place de la Fontaine. They immediately formed into companies  twenty strong, four of which hastened to the principal gates, while the  others patrolled the streets shouting, \"The city taken! Down with the  Papists! A new world!\" Hearing this, the Protestants in the city  recognised their co-religionists, and the Catholics their opponents: but  whereas the former had been warned and were on the alert, the latter  were taken by surprise; consequently they offered no resistance, which,  however, did not prevent bloodshed. M. de St. Andre, the governor of the  town, who during his short period of office had drawn the bitter hatred  of the Protestants on him, was shot dead in his bed, and his body being  flung out of the window, was torn in pieces by the populace. The work of  murder went on all night, and on the morrow the victors in their turn  began an organised persecution, which fell more heavily on the"]]]
