Then someone  saw that the canoe was gone. When Daniel Boone heard this, he picked up  his gun and rushed toward the river. He did not stop to put on his  shoes.    He felt sure that Indians had taken Jemima and her friends away.    Three young men who loved the girls very much went with Boone. The men  took another canoe and began to paddle down the river. They could not  go far in the dark. Before long, they had to stop and wait for morning.    When the sun came up, Boone found the girls' trail. He thought the  Indians were taking them toward the Ohio River. He knew he must catch  them before they crossed it and went to the Indian towns in the north.    The white men left their canoe. They traveled all day through the deep  woods. Then they made camp and waited for the long night to end. At  daylight they started out again.    Boone took short cuts through the woods, but he always found the trail.  His sharp eyes saw what the girls had left for him to see. One had dug  her heels into the soft mud. Another had left bits of her dress here  and there.    Boone led the young men straight through the heart of the forest to  Jemima and her friends. About noon the men caught sight of the girls.  The Indians had stopped with them for their noon meal. The white men  crept up. Bang! Bang! Bang! went their guns.    \"It's Father!\" Jemima cried.    \"Fall flat on your faces, girls!\" Daniel Boone shouted.    The white men ran toward the Indians. They shot their guns as they ran.    The Indians were taken by surprise. One Indian threw his tomahawk. It  almost hit the girls. Two Indians were shot. The others ran away.    The men took the three girls back to Boonesborough. Later the three  girls married the three young men.          The Fort Is Saved      Boone became known far and wide as the greatest man in the Kentucky  Wilderness. One winter, about a year after he had saved the girls from  the Indians, he went with some other men to a place where there were  salt springs. These were called salt licks because the wild animals  liked to lick the salt. The men planned to camp there several weeks.  They would boil the water in big kettles until there was only salt  left. Then they would take the salt back to the people at  Boonesborough.    One day Boone went out hunting alone. Suddenly he was surprised by  Indians. They were a war party led by Chief Blackfish. They were on  their way to Boonesborough. These Shawnee Indians came from north of  Kentucky. They felt that Henderson had no right to claim their hunting  grounds. Certainly _they_ had not sold Kentucky to him. They might not  have been so warlike if the American Revolution had not started. The  British were making friends with the Indians everywhere and helping  them fight the settlers.    Boone knew how the Shawnees felt about having to share their hunting  ground with the white men. But he knew also that he must find a way to  save the fort.    \"Don't go to Boonesborough now,\" he told the Indians. \"You don't have a  big enough war party. Boonesborough is far too strong for you to  capture.\"    This was not true at all. There were not many men at the fort. But  Daniel hoped to stall off the Shawnees until Boonesborough had time to  send for help.    \"Wait until spring,\" he went on. \"Then you won't have to fight. The  people will come willingly. I will bring them north to you. Right now  it is too cold for the women and the children to travel. But in the  spring they will come with you.\"    Chief Blackfish was delighted to find that Boone was so friendly. He  had admired Boone for a long time. He did not know that Boone was  trying hard to fool him.    \"What about your men?\" Chief Blackfish asked.    Boone thought quickly. He knew the Indians had seen the men at the salt  licks.    \"I will lead you to my men,\" he told Chief Blackfish, \"if you will  promise not to kill them.\"    Chief Blackfish promised. Boone took the Indians to his men.    \"We are in great danger,\" he whispered to them. \"We must go north with  the Indians, or they will kill us. The fort is in danger too. But  perhaps we can escape and warn our families.\"    At the end of the long journey the Indians and their prisoners reached  the Shawnee towns in the north. There, Chief Blackfish told Boone that  he wanted him for a son. He made Boone go through a long adoption  ceremony and gave him the name of Big Turtle.    Boone liked Chief Blackfish, but he did not really want to be a  Shawnee. He pretended to be pleased about becoming the Chief's son, but  he only pretended.    One day the Indians went hunting. While they were gone, Boone ran away  and started for Boonesborough.    The Indians followed him, but he was too clever for them. They lost his  trail. In four days he traveled one hundred and sixty miles.    Finally he reached Boonesborough.    \"The Indians are on the way! Get ready to fight!\" he told the people.    Soon Chief Blackfish came with over four hundred Shawnees. He called  Boone to come outside the fort. Daniel Boone went out bravely.    \"Why did you run away?\" Chief Blackfish asked Boone.    \"I wanted to see my wife and my children,\" Boone answered.    \"You have seen them,\" the Chief replied. \"Now come back with me. You  and all your people.\"    \"Give me a little time to think it over,\" Boone said.    He hoped that help would come from other forts. He waited and waited,  but no help came.    \"We shall defend the fort as long as a man is living,\" Boone told the  people.    The fight began. The Indians fired at the fort. The white men fired  back. Everyone worked hard. The women and the children loaded guns and  carried food to the men. The white men were outnumbered, but the  Indians did not know this.    The men did not stop fighting for eight days and eight nights. By then  everyone was very tired. The Indians had shot flaming torches, and the  roofs of the cabins were on fire. Not a drop of water was left in the  fort.    \"Look! Look!\" someone shouted.    The sky had been dark all day. Now it was starting to rain. It rained  and it poured. The rain came down and put out the fires. It filled the  tubs and pails with water to drink. Everyone felt hopeful again.    When morning came, no Indians were in sight. Every single one of them  was gone. They had disappeared into the forest. The fort was saved.          Daniel Boone's Reward      The Indian raids kept on all over Kentucky. When the American  Revolution ended, the British stopped helping the Indians fight the  settlers. Some tribes kept on fighting on their own, but finally the  settlers defeated the Indians and forced them to sign a treaty. Things  slowly became more peaceful.    More and more settlers came west. They came over the Wilderness Road  that Boone and his men had made. They came down the Ohio River in big  flatboats. These settlers killed game in the forest. They cleared land,  grew crops, built houses, and started towns.    Daniel Boone was fifty years old now. One day he discovered that he did  not own any of the land he had thought was his.    \"This does not seem right,\" he said. \"I was one of the first to come to  Kentucky. My life was hard. I risked it for the people many times.\"    It was not right, but it was true. Boone had been too busy hunting and  trapping to put his claims on paper.    Boone lost almost all his land. He tried to farm, but he was not a good  farmer. He tried to keep a store, but his heart was not in it. His good  wife, Rebecca, often took his place in the store, while Daniel worked  as a guide showing new settlers the way down the Ohio River. And he  held some jobs with the new government.    One day hunters told Daniel Boone about land farther west near the  great Mississippi River. \"It's wild and free,\" they said. \"There are  bear and deer. There are herds of buffalo. It's the kind of land  Kentucky used to be.\"    \"That's the place for me,\" Boone said. \"It's too crowded here. The  other day I looked out of the window and saw the smoke of another man's  cabin. I'll go west. I want elbow room.\"    And besides elbow room, he wanted land. He had always dreamed about  owning a lot of land.    He was disappointed about losing his claims in Kentucky.    So Boone and his family went west. The land where they settled belonged  to Spain. Later it was traded to the French and then bought by America.  It is the land we now call Missouri.    The Spaniards were proud to have Daniel Boone live among them. They  gave him all the land he wanted. He hunted and trapped in the new  country as he had in the old. He sold the furs and skins for a good  price.    Then Boone made a trip back to Kentucky. He called together all the  people he had once known.    \"I owed money to you when I left here,\" he said. \"I want to pay my  debts.\"    When he returned to his family in Missouri, Boone was a poor man again.  But he had a smile on his face.    \"I am a free man,\" he said. \"I owe nothing to any man. That makes it  worth being poor again.\"    The United States Congress voted to give Boone one thousand acres of  land. It was a reward for all he had done in exploring and settling the  West. He hunted and fished until he was very old. He never stopped  exploring. He was still looking for adventure and elbow room!    But Daniel Boone, traveler, hunter, woodsman, and fighter, will be  remembered longest as the man who opened the way to Kentucky.                           *      *      *      *      *      \"Get out of Kentucky and stay out!\" the Indians told Daniel Boone. But  Daniel Boone did not scare easily.    There was the time his daughter was kidnaped by the Indians. Boone  tracked the kidnapers through the forest and rescued her.    There was the time Boone was captured by the Shawnees. He escaped in  time to warn the people of Boonesborough: \"The Indians are coming! Get  ready to fight!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#3)"],[1,"a herd of wild  cattle. Creeping up on them, he caught hold of a young bull and killed  him. Then he cut up the flesh into strips of meat. He lighted a fire and  put the meat on spits to roast. While the meat was being cooked, Odin,  the Father of the Gods, a little way off, sat thinking on the things he  had seen in the world of men.    Loki made himself busy putting more and more logs on the fire. At last  he called to Odin, and the Father of the Gods came and sat down near the  fire to eat the meal.    But when the meat was taken off the cooking-spits and when Odin went to  cut it, he found that it was still raw. He smiled at Loki for thinking  the meat was cooked, and Loki, troubled that he had made a mistake, put  the meat back, and put more logs upon the fire. Again Loki took the meat  off the cooking-spits and called Odin to the meal.    Odin, when he took the meat that Loki brought him, found that it was as  raw as if it had never been put upon the fire. \"Is this a trick of  yours, Loki?\" he said.    Loki was so angry at the meat being uncooked that Odin saw he was  playing no tricks. In his hunger he raged at the meat and he raged at  the fire. Again he put the meat on the cooking-spits and put more logs  on the fire. Every hour he would take up the meat, sure that it was now  cooked, and every time he took it off Odin would find that the meat was  as raw as the first time they took it off the fire.    Now Odin knew that the meat must be under some enchantment by the  Giants. He stood up and went on his way, hungry but strong. Loki,  however, would not leave the meat that he had put back on the fire. He  would make it be cooked, he declared, and he would not leave that place  hungry.    The dawn came and he took up the meat again. As he was lifting it off  the fire he heard a whirr of wings above his head. Looking up, he saw a  mighty eagle, the largest eagle that ever appeared in the sky. The eagle  circled round and round and came above Loki's head. \"Canst thou not cook  thy food?\" the eagle screamed to him.    \"I cannot cook it,\" said Loki.    \"I will cook it for thee, if thou wilt give me a share,\" screamed the  eagle.    \"Come, then, and cook it for me,\" said Loki.    The eagle circled round until he was above the fire. Then flapping his  great wings over it, he made the fire blaze and blaze. A heat that Loki  had never felt before came from the burning logs. In a minute he drew  the meat from the spits and found it was well cooked.    \"My share, my share, give me my share,\" the eagle screamed at him. He  flew down, and seizing on a large piece of meat instantly devoured it.  He seized on another piece. Piece after piece he devoured until it  looked as if Loki would be left with no meat for his meal.    As the eagle seized on the last piece Loki became angry indeed. Taking  up the spit on which the meat had been cooked, he struck at the eagle.  There was a clang as if he had struck some metal. The wood of the spit  did not come away. It stuck to the breast of the eagle. But Loki did not  let go his hold on the spit. Suddenly the eagle rose up in the air.  Loki, who held to the spit that was fastened to the eagle's breast, was  drawn up with him.    Before he knew what had happened Loki was miles and miles up in the air  and the eagle was flying with him toward Joetunheim, the Realm of the  Giants. And the eagle was screaming out, \"Loki, friend Loki, I have thee  at last. It was thou who didst cheat my brother of his reward for  building the wall round Asgard. But, Loki, I have thee at last. Know now  that Thiassi the Giant has captured thee, O Loki, most cunning of the  dwellers in Asgard.\"    Thus the eagle screamed as he went flying with Loki toward Joetunheim,  the Realm of the Giants. They passed over the river that divides  Joetunheim from Midgard, the World of Men. And now Loki saw a terrible  place beneath him, a land of ice and rock. Great mountains were there:  they were lighted by neither sun nor moon, but by columns of fire thrown  up now and again through cracks in the earth or out of the peaks of the  mountains.    Over a great iceberg the eagle hovered. Suddenly he shook the spit from  his breast and Loki fell down on the ice. The eagle screamed out to him,  \"Thou art in my power at last, O thou most cunning of all the Dwellers  in Asgard.\" The eagle left Loki there and flew within a crack in the  mountain.    Miserable indeed was Loki upon that iceberg. The cold was deadly. He  could not die there, for he was one of the Dwellers in Asgard and death  might not come to him that way. He might not die, but he felt bound to  that iceberg with chains of cold.    After a day his captor came to him, not as an eagle this time, but in  his own form, Thiassi the Giant.    \"Wouldst thou leave thine iceberg, Loki,\" he said, \"and return to thy  pleasant place in Asgard? Thou dost delight in Asgard, although only by  one-half dost thou belong to the Gods. Thy father, Loki, was the Wind  Giant.\"    \"O that I might leave this iceberg,\" Loki said, with the tears freezing  on his face.    \"Thou mayst leave it when thou showest thyself ready to pay thy ransom  to me,\" said Thiassi. \"Thou wilt have to get me the shining apples that  Iduna keeps in her basket.\"    \"I cannot get Iduna's apples for thee, Thiassi,\" said Loki.    \"Then stay upon the iceberg,\" said Thiassi the Giant. He went away and  left Loki there with the terrible winds buffeting him as with blows of a  hammer.    When Thiassi came again and spoke to him about his ransom, Loki said,  \"There is no way of getting the shining apples from Iduna.\"    \"There must be some way, O cunning Loki,\" said the Giant.    \"Iduna, although she guards well the shining apples, is simple-minded,\"  said Loki. \"It may be that I shall be able to get her to go outside the  wall of Asgard. If she goes she will bring her shining apples with her,  for she never lets them go out of her hand except when she gives them to  the Gods and Goddesses to eat.\"    \"Make it so that she will go beyond the wall of Asgard,\" said the Giant.  \"If she goes outside of the wall I shall get the apples from her. Swear  by the World-Tree that thou wilt lure Iduna beyond the wall of Asgard.  Swear it, Loki, and I shall let thee go.\"    \"I swear it by Ygdrassil, the World-Tree, that I will lure Iduna beyond  the wall of Asgard if thou wilt take me off this iceberg,\" said Loki.    Then Thiassi changed himself into a mighty eagle, and taking Loki in his  talons, he flew with him over the stream that divides Joetunheim, the  Realm of the Giants, from Midgard, the World of Men. He left Loki on the  ground of Midgard, and Loki then went on his way to Asgard.    Now Odin had already returned and he had told the Dwellers in Asgard of  Loki's attempt to cook the enchanted meat. All laughed to think that  Loki had been left hungry for all his cunning. Then when he came into  Asgard looking so famished, they thought it was because Loki had had  nothing to eat. They laughed at him more and more. But they brought him  into the Feast Hall and they gave him the best of food with wine out of  Odin's wine cup. When the feast was over the Dwellers in Asgard went to  Iduna's garden as was their wont.    There sat Iduna in the golden house that opened on her garden. Had she  been in the world of men, every one who saw her would have remembered  their own innocence, seeing one who was so fair and good. She had eyes  blue as the blue sky, and she smiled as if she were remembering lovely  things she had seen or heard. The basket of shining apples was beside  her.    To each God and Goddess Iduna gave a shining apple. Each one ate the  apple given, rejoicing to think that they would never become a day  older. Then Odin, the Father of the Gods, said the runes that were  always said in praise of Iduna, and the Dwellers in Asgard went out of  Iduna's garden, each one going to his or her own shining house.    All went except Loki, the doer of good and the doer of evil. Loki sat in  the garden, watching fair and simple Iduna. After a while she spoke to  him and said, \"Why dost thou still stay here, wise Loki?\"    \"To look well on thine apples,\" Loki said. \"I am wondering if the apples  I saw yesterday are really as shining as the apples that are in thy  basket.\"    \"There are no apples in the world as shining as mine,\" said Iduna.    \"The apples I saw were more shining,\" said Loki. \"Aye, and they smelled  better, Iduna.\"    Iduna was troubled at what Loki, whom she deemed so wise, told her. Her  eyes filled with tears that there might be more shining apples in the  world than hers. \"O Loki,\" she said, \"it cannot be. No apples are more  shining, and none smell so sweet, as the apples I pluck off the tree in  my garden.\"    \"Go, then, and see,\" said Loki. \"Just outside Asgard is the tree that  has the apples I saw. Thou, Iduna, dost never leave thy garden, and so  thou dost not know what grows in the world. Go outside of Asgard and  see.\"    \"I will go, Loki,\" said Iduna, the fair and simple.    Iduna went outside the wall of Asgard. She went to the place Loki had  told her that the apples grew in. But as she looked this way and that  way, Iduna heard a whirr of wings above her. Looking up, she saw a  mighty eagle, the largest eagle that had ever appeared in the sky.    She drew back toward the gate of Asgard. Then the great eagle swooped  down; Iduna felt herself lifted up, and then she was being carried away  from Asgard, away, away; away over Midgard where men lived, away toward  the rocks and snows of Joetunheim. Across the river that flows between  the World of Men and the Realm of the Giants Iduna was borne. Then the  eagle flew into a cleft in a mountain and Iduna was left in a cavernous  hall lighted up by columns of fire that burst up from the earth.    The eagle loosened his grip on Iduna and she sank down on the ground of  the cavern. The wings and the feathers fell from him and she saw her  captor"]]]
