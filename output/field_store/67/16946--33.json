Sec. 10. I shall not speak of the Knowledge of the Notes, of their Value,  of Time, of Pauses, of the Accidents, nor of other such trivial  Beginnings, because they are generally known.    Sec. 11. Besides the _C_ Cliff, let the Scholar be instructed in all the  other Cliffs, and in all their Situations, that he may not be liable to  what often happens to some Singers, who, in Compositions _Alla  Capella_,[6] know not how to distinguish the _Mi_ from the _Fa_, without  the Help of the Organ, for want of the Knowledge of the _G_ Cliff; from  whence such Discordancies arise in divine Service, that it is a Shame  for those who grow old in their Ignorance. I must be so sincere to  declare, that whoever does not give such essential Instructions,  transgresses out of Omission, or out of Ignorance.[7]    Sec. 12. Next let him learn to read those in _B Molle_, especially in  those[8] Compositions that have four Flats at the Cliff, and which on  the sixth of the Bass require for the most part an accidental Flat, that  the Scholar may find in them the _Mi_, which is not so easy to one who  has studied but little, and thinks that all the Notes with a Flat are  called _Fa_: for if that were true, it would be superfluous that the  Notes should be six, when five of them have the same Denomination. The  _French_ use seven, and, by that additional Name, save their scholars  the Trouble of learning the Mutations ascending or descending; but we  _Italians_ have but _Ut_, _Re_, _Mi_, _Fa_, _Sol_, _La_; Notes which  equally suffice throughout all the Keys, to one who knows how to read  them.[9]    Sec. 13. Let the Master do his utmost, to make the Scholar hit and sound  the Notes perfectly in Tune in _Sol-Fa_-ing. One, who has not a good  Ear, should not undertake either to instruct, or to sing; it being  intolerable to hear a Voice perpetually rise and fall discordantly. Let  the Instructor reflect on it; for one that sings out of Tune loses all  his other Perfections. I can truly say, that, except in some few  Professors, that modern Intonation is very bad.    Sec. 14. In the _Sol-Fa_-ing, let him endeavour to gain by Degrees the high  Notes, that by the Help of this Exercise he may acquire as much Compass  of the Voice as possible. Let him take care, however, that the higher  the Notes, the more it is necessary to touch them with Softness, to  avoid Screaming.    Sec. 15. He ought to make him hit the Semitones according to the true  Rules. Every one knows not that there is a Semitone Major and  Minor,[10] because the Difference cannot be known by an Organ or  Harpsichord, if the Keys of the Instrument are not split. A Tone, that  gradually passes to another, is divided into nine almost imperceptible  Intervals, which are called Comma's, five of which constitute the  Semitone Major, and four the Minor. Some are of Opinion, that there are  no more than seven, and that the greatest Number of the one half  constitutes the first, and the less the second; but this does not  satisfy my weak Understanding, for the Ear would find no Difficulty to  distinguish the seventh part of a Tone; whereas it meets with a very  great one to distinguish the ninth. If one were continually to sing only  to those abovemention'd Instruments, this Knowledge might be  unnecessary; but since the time that Composers introduced the Custom of  crowding the Opera's with a vast Number of Songs accompanied with Bow  Instruments, it becomes so necessary, that if a _Soprano_ was to sing  _D_ sharp, like _E_ flat, a nice Ear will find he is out of Tune,  because this last rises. Whoever is not satisfied in this, let him read  those Authors who treat of it, and let him consult the best Performers  on the Violin. In the middle parts, however, it is not so easy to  distinguish the Difference; tho' I am of Opinion, that every thing that  is divisible, is to be distinguished. Of these two Semitones, I'll speak  more amply in the Chapter of the _Appoggiatura_, that the one may not be  confounded with the other.    Sec. 16. Let him teach the Scholar to hit the Intonation of any Interval in  the Scale perfectly and readily, and keep him strictly to this important  Lesson, if he is desirous he should sing with Readiness in a short time.    Sec. 17. If the Master does not understand Composition, let him provide  himself with good Examples of _Sol-Fa_-ing in divers Stiles, which  insensibly lead from the most easy to the more difficult, according as  he finds the Scholar improves; with this Caution, that however  difficult, they may be always natural and agreeable, to induce the  Scholar to study with Pleasure.    Sec. 18. Let the Master attend with great Care to the Voice of the Scholar,  which, whether it be _di Petto_, or _di Testa_, should always come forth  neat and clear, without passing thro' the Nose, or being choaked in the  Throat; which are two the most horrible Defects in a Singer, and past  all Remedy if once grown into a Habit[11].    Sec. 19. The little Experience of some that teach to _Sol-fa_, obliges the  Scholar to hold out the _Semibreves_ with Force on the highest Notes;  the Consequence of which is, that the Glands of the Throat become daily  more and more inflamed, and if the Scholar loses not his Health, he  loses the treble Voice.    Sec. 20. Many Masters put their Scholars to sing the _Contr'Alto_, not  knowing how to help them to the _Falsetto_, or to avoid the Trouble of  finding it.    Sec. 21. A diligent Master, knowing that a _Soprano_, without the  _Falsetto_, is constrained to sing within the narrow Compass of a few  Notes, ought not only to endeavour to help him to it, but also to leave  no Means untried, so to unite the feigned and the natural Voice, that  they may not be distinguished; for if they do not perfectly unite, the  Voice will be of divers[12] Registers, and must consequently lose its  Beauty. The Extent of the full natural Voice terminates generally upon  the fourth Space, which is _C_; or on the fifth Line, which is _D_; and  there the feigned Voice becomes of Use, as well in going up to the high  Notes, as returning to the natural Voice; the Difficulty consists in  uniting them. Let the Master therefore consider of what Moment the  Correction of this Defect is, which ruins the Scholar if he overlooks  it. Among the Women, one hears sometimes a _Soprano_ entirely _di  Petto_, but among the Male Sex it would be a great Rarity, should they  preserve it after having past the age of Puberty. Whoever would be  curious to discover the feigned Voice of one who has the Art to disguise  it, let him take Notice, that the Artist sounds the Vowel _i_, or _e_,  with more Strength and less Fatigue than the Vowel _a_, on the high  Notes.    Sec. 22. The _Voce di Testa_ has a great Volubility, more of the high than  the lower Notes, and has a quick Shake, but subject to be lost for want  of Strength.    Sec. 23. Let the Scholar be obliged to pronounce the Vowels distinctly,  that they may be heard for such as they are. Some Singers think to  pronounce the first, and you hear the second; if the Fault is not the  Master's, it is of those Singers, who are scarce got out of their first  Lessons; they study to sing with Affectation, as if ashamed to open  their Mouths; others, on the contrary, stretching theirs too much,  confound these two Vowels with the fourth, making it impossible to  comprehend whether they have said _Balla_ or _Bella_, _Sesso_ or  _Sasso_, _Mare_ or _More_.    Sec. 24. He should always make the Scholar sing standing, that the Voice  may have all its Organization free.    Sec. 25. Let him take care, whilst he sings, that he get a graceful  Posture, and make an agreeable Appearance.    Sec. 26. Let him rigorously correct all Grimaces and Tricks of the Head, of  the Body, and particularly of the Mouth; which ought to be composed in  a Manner (if the Sense of the Words permit it) rather inclined to a  Smile, than too much Gravity.    Sec. 27. Let him always use the Scholar to the Pitch of _Lombardy_, and not  that of _Rome_;[13] not only to make him acquire and preserve the high  Notes, but also that he may not find it troublesome when he meets with  Instruments that are tun'd high; the Pain of reaching them not only  affecting the Hearer, but the Singer. Let the Master be mindful of this;  for as Age advances, so the Voice declines; and, in Progress of Time, he  will either sing a _Contr'Alto_, or pretending still, out of a foolish  Vanity, to the Name of a _Soprano_, he will be obliged to make  Application to every Composer, that the Notes may not exceed the fourth  Space (_viz._, _C_) nor the Voice hold out on them. If all those, who  teach the first Rudiments, knew how to make use of this Rule, and to  unite the feigned to the natural Voice, there would not be now so great  a scarcity of _Soprano's_.    Sec. 28. Let him learn to hold out the Notes without a Shrillness like a  Trumpet, or trembling; and if at the Beginning he made him hold out  every Note the length of two Bars, the Improvement would be the greater;  otherwise from the natural Inclination that the Beginners have to keep  the Voice in Motion, and the Trouble in holding it out, he will get a  habit, and not be able to fix it, and will become subject to a  Flutt'ring in the Manner of all those that sing in a very bad Taste.    Sec. 29. In the same Lessons, let him teach the Art to put forth the Voice,  which consists in letting it swell by Degrees from the softest _Piano_  to the loudest _Forte_, and from thence with the same Art return from  the _Forte_ to the _Piano_. A beautiful _Messa di Voce_,[14] from a  Singer that uses it sparingly, and only on the open Vowels, can never  fail of having an exquisite Effect. Very few of the present Singers find  it to their Taste, either from the Instability"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#3)"],[1,"evident that Sergeant Carmody, unable to stand such  futile practice any longer, quietly stole up to the loaded guns  and fired them in succession. The aim lacked final correction;  and the result was small, except that Moultrie, thinking itself  in danger, concentrated all its efforts on silencing these guns.  The silencing seemed most effective; for Carmody could not reload  alone, and so his first shots were his last.    At nightfall Sumter ceased fire while the Confederates kept on  slowly till daylight. Next morning the officers' quarters were set  on fire by red-hot shot. Immediately the Confederates redoubled  their efforts. Inside Sumter the fire was creeping towards the  magazine, the door of which was shut only just in time. Then the  flagstaff was shot down. Anderson ran his colors up again, but the  situation was rapidly becoming impossible. Most of the worn-out men  were fighting the flames while a few were firing at long intervals to  show they would not yet give in. This excited the generous admiration  of the enemy, who cheered the gallantry of Sumter while sneering  at the caution of the Union fleet outside. The fact was, however,  that this so-called fleet was a mere assemblage of vessels quite  unable to fight the Charleston batteries and without the slightest  chance of saving Sumter.    Having done his best for the honor of the flag, though not a man  was killed within the walls, Anderson surrendered in the afternoon.  Charleston went wild with joy; but applauded the generosity of  Beauregard's chivalrous terms. Next day, Sunday the fourteenth,  Anderson's little garrison saluted the Stars and Stripes with fifty  guns, and then, with colors flying, marched down on board a transport  to the strains of _Yankee Doodle_.    Strange to say, after being four years in Confederate hands, Sumter  was recaptured by the Union forces on the anniversary of its surrender.  It was often bombarded, though never taken, in the meantime.    The fall of Sumter not only fired all Union loyalty but made  Confederates eager for the fray. The very next day Lincoln called  for 75,000 three-month volunteers. Two days later Confederate letters  of marque were issued to any privateers that would prey on Union  shipping. Two days later again Lincoln declared a blockade of every  port from South Carolina round to Texas. Eight days afterwards he  extended it to North Carolina and Virginia.    [Illustration: _GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE_  Photograph. In the collection of L. C. Handy, Washington.]    But in the meantime Lincoln had been himself marooned in Washington.  On the nineteenth of April, the day he declared his first blockade,  the Sixth Massachusetts were attacked by a mob in Baltimore, through  which the direct rails ran from North to South. Baltimore was full  of secession, and the bloodshed roused its fury. Maryland was a  border slave State out of which the District of Columbia was carved.  Virginia had just seceded. So when the would-be Confederates of  Maryland, led by the Mayor of Baltimore, began tearing up rails,  burning bridges, and cutting the wires, the Union Government found  itself enisled in a hostile sea. Its own forces abandoned the Arsenal  at Harper's Ferry and the Navy Yard at Norfolk. The work of demolition  at Harper's Ferry had to be bungled off in haste, owing to shortness  of time and lack of means. The demolition of Norfolk was better  done, and the ships were sunk at anchor. But many valuable stores  fell into enemy hands at both these Virginian outposts of the Federal  forces. Through six long days of dire suspense not a ship, not a  train, came into Washington. At last, on the twenty-fifth, the  Seventh New York got through, having come south by boat with the  Eighth Massachusetts, landed at Annapolis, and commandeered a train  to run over relaid rails. With them came the news that all the  loyal North was up, that the Seventh had marched through miles of  cheering patriots in New York, and that these two fine regiments  were only the vanguard of a host.    But just a week before Lincoln experienced this inexpressible relief  he lost, and his enemy won, a single officer, who, according to  Winfield Scott, was alone worth more than fifty thousand veteran  men. On the seventeenth of April Virginia voted for secession.  On the eighteenth Lee had a long confidential interview with his  old chief, Winfield Scott. On the twentieth he resigned, writing  privately to Scott at the same time: \"My resignation would have been  presented at once but for the struggle it has cost me to separate  myself from a service to which I have devoted the best years of my  life. During the whole of that time I have experienced nothing but  kindness from my superiors and a most cordial friendship from my  comrades. I shall carry to the grave the most grateful recollections  of your kind consideration, and your name and fame shall always be  dear to me. Save in the defense of my native State I never desire  again to draw my sword.\"    The three great motives which finally determined his momentous  course of action were: first, his aversion from taking any part  in coercing the home folks of Virginia; secondly, his belief in  State rights, tempered though it was by admiration for the Union;  and thirdly, his clear perception that war was now inevitable, and  that defeat for the South would inevitably mean a violent change  of all the ways of Southern life, above all, a change imposed by  force from outside, instead of the gradual change he wished to  see effected from within. He was opposed to slavery; and both his  own and his wife's slaves had long been free. Like his famous  lieutenant, Stonewall Jackson, he was particularly kind to the  blacks; none of whom ever wanted to leave, once they had been domiciled  at Arlington, the estate that came to him through his wife, Mary  Custis, great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. But, like Lincoln  before the war, he wished emancipation to come from the slave States  themselves, as in time it must have come, with due regard for  compensation.    On the twenty-third of this eventful April Lee was given the chief  command of all Virginia's forces. Three days later \"Joe\" Johnston  took command of the Virginians at Richmond. One day later again  \"Stonewall\" Jackson took command at Harper's Ferry. Johnston played  a great and noble part throughout the war; and we shall meet him  again and again, down to the very end. But Jackson claims our first  attention here.    Like all the great leaders on both sides Jackson had been an officer  of regulars. He was, however, in many ways unlike the army type.  He disliked society amusements, was awkward, shy, reserved, and  apparently recluse. Moderately tall, with large hands and feet,  stiff in his movements, ungainly in the saddle, he was a mere nobody  in public estimation when the war broke out. A few brother-officers  had seen his consummate skill and bravery as a subaltern in Mexico;  and still fewer close acquaintances had seen his sterling qualities  at Lexington, where, for ten years, he had been a professor at  the Virginia Military Institute. But these few were the only ones  who were not surprised when this recluse of peace suddenly became  a very thunderbolt of war--Puritan in soul, Cavalier in daring:  a Cromwell come to life again.    Harper's Ferry was a strategic point in northern Virginia. It was  the gate to the Shenandoah Valley as well as the point where the  Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the Potomac some sixty miles  northwest of Washington. Harper's Ferry was known by name to North  and South through John Brown's raid two years before. It was now  coveted by Virginia for its Arsenal as well as for its command of  road, rail, and water routes. The plan to raid it was arranged at  Richmond on the sixteenth of April. But when the raiders reached  it on the eighteenth they found it abandoned and its Arsenal in  flames. The machine shops, however, were saved, as well as the  metal parts of twenty thousand stand of arms. Then the Virginia  militiamen and volunteers streamed in, to the number of over four  thousand. They were a mere conglomeration of semi-independent units,  mostly composed of raw recruits under officers who themselves knew  next to nothing. As usual with such fledgling troops there was no  end to the fuss and feathers among the members of the busybody  staffs, who were numerous enough to manage an army but clumsy enough  to spoil a platoon. It was said, and not without good reason, that  there was as much gold lace at Harper's Ferry, when the sun was  shining, as at a grand review in Paris.    Into this gaudy assemblage rode Thomas Jonathan Jackson, mounted  on Little Sorrel, a horse as unpretentious as himself, and dressed  in his faded old blue professor's uniform without one gleam of  gold. He had only two staff officers, both dressed as plainly as  himself. He was not a major-general, nor even a brigadier; just a  colonel. He held no trumpeting reviews. He made no flowery speeches.  He didn't even swear. The armed mob at Harper's Ferry felt that  they would lose caste on Sunday afternoons under a commandant like  this. Their feelings were still more outraged when they heard that  every officer above the rank of captain was to lose his higher  rank, and that all new reappointments were to be made on military  merit and direct from Richmond. Companies accustomed to elect their  officers according to the whim of the moment eagerly joined the  higher officers in passing adverse resolutions. But authorities who  were unanimous for Lee were not to be shaken by such absurdities  in face of a serious war. And when the froth had been blown off  the top, and the dregs drained out of the bottom, the solid mass  between, who really were sound patriots, settled down to work.    There was seven hours' drill every day except Sunday; no light task  for a mere armed mob groping its ignorant way, however"]]]
