As soon as he was old enough to understand  things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had  been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull's life. \"All the jungle  is thine,\" said Bagheera, \"and thou canst kill everything that thou art  strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee  thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of  the Jungle.\" Mowgli obeyed faithfully.    And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that  he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of  except things to eat.    Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature  to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a  young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot  it because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf  if he had been able to speak in any human tongue.    Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew  older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the  younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela  would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the  proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such  fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man's  cub. \"They tell me,\" Shere Khan would say, \"that at Council ye dare  not look him between the eyes.\" And the young wolves would growl and  bristle.    Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and  once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill  him some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: \"I have the Pack and I have  thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my  sake. Why should I be afraid?\"    It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of  something that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him;  but he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay  with his head on Bagheera's beautiful black skin, \"Little Brother, how  often have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?\"    \"As many times as there are nuts on that palm,\" said Mowgli, who,  naturally, could not count. \"What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and  Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.\"    \"But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack  know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee  too.\"    \"Ho! ho!\" said Mowgli. \"Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude  talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I  caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to  teach him better manners.\"    \"That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he would  have told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open those  eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But  remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill  his buck, and then he will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that  looked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old  too, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that  a man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a  man.\"    \"And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?\" said  Mowgli. \"I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle,  and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.  Surely they are my brothers!\"    Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.  \"Little Brother,\" said he, \"feel under my jaw.\"    Mowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera's silky  chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair,  he came upon a little bald spot.    \"There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that  mark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among  men, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the  king's palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price  for thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too  was born among men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind  bars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the  Panther--and no man's plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one  blow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men,  I became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mowgli, \"all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.\"    \"Oh, thou art a man's cub,\" said the Black Panther very tenderly. \"And  even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to  the men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.\"    \"But why--but why should any wish to kill me?\" said Mowgli.    \"Look at me,\" said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between  the eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.    \"That is why,\" he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. \"Not even I can  look thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee,  Little Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet  thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from  their feet--because thou art a man.\"    \"I did not know these things,\" said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned  under his heavy black eyebrows.    \"What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By  thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It is  in my heart that when Akela misses his next kill--and at each hunt  it costs him more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him and  against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and  then--I have it!\" said Bagheera, leaping up. \"Go thou down quickly to  the men's huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they  grow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger  friend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the Red  Flower.\"    By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will  call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it,  and invents a hundred ways of describing it.    \"The Red Flower?\" said Mowgli. \"That grows outside their huts in the  twilight. I will get some.\"    \"There speaks the man's cub,\" said Bagheera proudly. \"Remember that it  grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of  need.\"    \"Good!\" said Mowgli. \"I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera\"--he  slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big  eyes--\"art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan's doing?\"    \"By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.\"    \"Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for  this, and it may be a little over,\" said Mowgli, and he bounded away.    \"That is a man. That is all a man,\" said Bagheera to himself, lying down  again. \"Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt  of thine ten years ago!\"    Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart  was hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew  breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother  Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was  troubling her frog.    \"What is it, Son?\" she said.    \"Some bat's chatter of Shere Khan,\" he called back. \"I hunt among the  plowed fields tonight,\" and he plunged downward through the bushes, to  the stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he heard  the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur,  and the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter  howls from the young wolves: \"Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his  strength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!\"    The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the  snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with  his forefoot.    He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew  fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers  lived.    \"Bagheera spoke truth,\" he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle  fodder by the window of a hut. \"To-morrow is one day both for Akela and  for me.\"    Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on  the hearth. He saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night  with black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white  and cold, he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside  with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his  blanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre.    \"Is that all?\" said Mowgli. \"If a cub can do it, there is nothing to  fear.\" So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from  his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.    \"They are very like me,\" said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had  seen the woman do. \"This thing will die if I do not give it things to  eat\"; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up  the hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on  his coat.    \"Akela has missed,\" said the Panther. \"They would have killed him last  night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the  hill.\"    \"I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!\" Mowgli held up the  fire-pot.    \"Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and  presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not  afraid?\"    \"No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,  before I was a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#3)"],[1,"ed, governed by the  joint decision of the feelings in council assembled, before whom every  action shall have been fully debated, and calmly determined--that it is  which education, moral education at least, strives to produce.\"    7. THE BEST REGULATED HOME.--The best regulated home is always that in  which the discipline is the most perfect, and yet where it is the least  felt. Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature. Those  subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously; and though it shapes  and forms the whole character, until the life becomes crystallized in  habit, the influence thus exercised is for the most part unseen, and almost  unfelt. {15}    8. PRACTICE SELF-DENIAL.--If a man would get through life honorably and  peaceably, he must necessarily learn to practice self-denial in small  things as well as in great. Men have to bear as well as to forbear. The  temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment; and the little demons  of ill-humor, petulance, and sarcasm, kept resolutely at a distance. If  once they find an entrance to the mind, they are apt to return, and to  establish for themselves a permanent occupation there.    9. POWER OF WORDS.--It is necessary to one's personal happiness, to  exercise control over one's words as well as acts: for there are words that  strike even harder than blows; and men may \"speak daggers,\" though they use  none. The stinging repartee that rises to the lips, and which, if uttered,  might cover an adversary with confusion, how difficult it is to resist  saying it! \"Heaven, keep us,\" says Miss Bremer, in her 'Home', \"from the  destroying power of words! There are words that sever hearts more than  sharp swords do; there are words the point of which sting the heart through  the course of a whole life.\"    10. CHARACTER EXHIBITS ITSELF.--Character exhibits itself in self-control  of speech as much as in anything else. The wise and forbearant man will  restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing at the expense of  another's feeling; while the fool blurts out what he thinks, and will  sacrifice his friend rather than his joke. \"The mouth of a wise man,\" said  Solomon, \"is in his heart: the heart of a fool is in his mouth.\"    11. BURNS.--No one knew the value of self-control better than the poet  Burns, and no one could teach it more eloquently to others, but when it  came to practice, Burns was as weak as the weakest. He could not deny  himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at another's  expense. One of his biographers observed of him, that it was no extravagant  arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made himself a hundred  enemies. But this was not all. Poor Burns exercised no control over his  appetites, but freely gave them the rein:     \"Thus thoughtless follies laid him low,    And stained his name.\"    [Illustration: LOST SELF-CONTROL.]    12. SOW POLLUTION.--Nor had he the self-denial to resist giving publicity  to compositions originally intended for the delight of the tap-room, but  which continued secretly to sow pollution broadcast in the minds of youth.  Indeed, notwithstanding the many exquisite poems of this writer, it is not  saying too much that his immoral writings have done far more harm than his  purer writings have done good; and {16} it would be better that all his  writings should be destroyed and forgotten, provided his indecent songs  could be destroyed with them.    13. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--Many of our young men lack moral principle. They  cannot look upon a beautiful girl with a pure heart and pure thoughts. They  have not manifested or practiced that self-control which develops true  manhood, and brings into subordination evil thoughts, evil passions, and  evil practices. Men who have no self-control will find life a failure, both  in a social and in a business sense. The world despises an insignificant  person who lacks backbone and character. Stand upon your manhood and  womanhood; honor your convictions, and dare to do right.    14. STRONG DRINK.--There is the habit of strong drink. It is only the lack  of self-control that brings men into the depths of degradation; on account  of the cup, the habit of taking drink occasionally in its milder forms--of  playing with a small appetite that only needs sufficient playing with to  make you a demon or a dolt. You think you are safe; I know you are not  safe, if you drink at all; and when you get offended with the good friends  that warn you of your danger, you are a fool. I know that the grave  swallows daily, by scores, drunkards, every one of whom thought he was safe  while he was forming his appetite. But this is old talk. A young man in  this age who forms the habit of drinking, or puts himself in danger of  forming the habit, is usually so weak that it doesn't pay to save him.           *       *       *       *       *      {17}    Habit.        It is almost as difficult to make a man unlearn his Errors as his      Knowledge.--COLTON.        There are habits contracted by bad example, or bad management, before      we have judgment to discern their approaches, or because the eye of      Reason is laid asleep, or has not compass of view sufficient to look      around on every quarter.--TUCKER.           *       *       *       *       *    1. HABIT.--Our real strength in life depends upon habits formed in early  life. The young man who sows his wild oats and indulges in the social cup,  is fastening chains upon himself that never can be broken. The innocent  youth by solitary practice of self-abuse will fasten upon himself a habit  which will wreck his physical constitution and bring suffering and misery  and ruin. Young man and young woman, beware of bad habits formed in early  life.    2. A BUNDLE OF HABITS.--Man, it has been said, is a bundle of habits; and  habit is second nature. Metastasio entertained so strong an opinion as to  the power of repetition in act and thought, that he said, \"All is habit in  mankind, even virtue itself.\" Evil habits must be conquered, or they will  conquer us and destroy our peace and happiness.    3. VICIOUS HABITS.--Vicious habits, when opposed, offer the most vigorous  resistence on the first attack. At each successive encounter this  resistence grows fainter and fainter, until finally it ceases altogether  and the victory is achieved. Habit is man's best friend and worst enemy; it  can exalt him to the highest pinnacle of virtue, honor and happiness, or  sink him to the lowest depths of vice, shame and misery.    4. HONESTY, OR KNAVERY.--We may form habits of honesty, or knavery; truth,  or falsehood; of industry, or idleness; frugality, or extravagance; of  patience, or impatience; self-denial, or self-indulgence; of kindness,  cruelty, politeness, rudeness, prudence, perseverance, circumspection. In  short, there is not a virtue, nor a vice; not an act of body, nor of mind,  to which we may not be chained down by this despotic power.    5. BEGIN WELL.--It is a great point for young men to begin well; for it is  the beginning of life that that system of conduct is adopted which soon  assumes the force of habit. Begin well, and the habit of doing well will  become quite easy, as easy as the habit of doing badly. Pitch upon that  course of life which is the most excellent, and habit will render it the  most delightful.           *       *       *       *       *      {18}    A Good Name.    1. THE LONGING FOR A GOOD NAME.--The longing for a good name is one of  those laws of nature that were passed for the soul and written down within  to urge toward a life of action, and away from small or wicked action. So  large is this passion that it is set forth in poetic thought, as having a  temple grand as that of Jupiter or Minerva, and up whose marble steps all  noble minds struggle--the temple of Fame.    2. CIVILIZATION.--Civilization is the ocean of which the millions of  individuals are the rivers and torrents. These rivers and torrents swell  with those rains of money and home and fame and happiness, and then fall  and run almost dry, but the ocean of civilization has gathered up all these  waters, and holds them in sparkling beauty for all subsequent use.  Civilization is a fertile delta made by the drifting souls of men.    3. FAME.--The word \"fame\" never signifies simply notoriety. The meaning of  the direct term may be seen from its negation or opposite, for only the  meanest of men are called infamous. They are utterly without fame, utterly  nameless; but if fame implied only notoriety then infamous would possess no  marked significance. Fame is an undertaker that pays but little attention  to the living, but who bedizens the dead, furnishes out their funerals and  follows them to the grave.    4. LIFE-MOTIVE.--So in studying that life-motive which is called a \"good  name,\" we must ask the large human race to tell us the high merit of this  spiritual longing. We must read the words of the sage, who said long  centuries ago that \"a good name was rather chosen than great riches.\" Other  sages have said as much. Solon said that \"He that will sell his good name  will sell the State.\" Socrates said, \"Fame is the perfume of heroic deeds.\"  Our Shakspeare said, \"He lives in fame who died in virtue's cause.\"    5. INFLUENCES OF OUR AGE.--Our age is deeply influenced by the motives  called property and home and pleasure, but it is a question whether the  generation in action to-day and the generation on the threshold of this  intense life are conscious fully of the worth of an honorable name.    6. BEAUTY OF CHARACTER.--We do not know whether with us all a good name is  less sweet than it was with our fathers, but this is painfully evident,  that our times do not sufficiently behold the beauty of character--their  sense does not {19} detect quickly enough or love deeply enough this aroma  of heroic deeds.    7.
