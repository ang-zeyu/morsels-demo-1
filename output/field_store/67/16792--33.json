The whole should have been issued in one  volume of the same size in smaller type, and would then have been as  delightful in form as it is in substance.    It is not enough that all the elements of a book be honest, sincere,  enduring; otherwise the clumsy royal octavos of Leslie Stephen's edition  of Fielding would be as attractive as \"the dear and dumpy twelves\" of  the original editions. Royal octavo, indeed, seems to be the pitfall of  the book designer, though there is no inherent objection to it. Where in  the whole range of reference books will be found a more attractive set  of volumes than Moulton's \"Library of Literary Criticism,\" with their  realization in this format of the Horatian _simplex munditiis_? For  extremely different treatments of this book size it is instructive to  compare the slender volumes of the original editions of Ruskin with the  slightly shorter but very much thicker volumes of the scholarly  definitive edition, which is a monument of excellence in every element  of book design except the crowning one of fitness. Our libraries must  have this edition for its completeness and its editorship; its material  excellence will insure the transmission of Ruskin's message to future  centuries; but no one will ever fall in love with these volumes or think  of likening them to the marriage of \"perfect music unto noble words.\"    Granted that the designer knows the tools of his trade,--grasps the  expressional value of every element with which he has to deal, from the  cut of a type to the surface of a binder's cloth,--his task, as we said,  is first to know the soul of the book intrusted to him for embodiment;  it is next to decide upon its most characteristic quality, or the sum of  its qualities; and, lastly, it is so to use his physical elements as to  give to the completed book an expression that shall be the outward  manifestation of its indwelling spirit. This is all that can be asked of  him; but, if he would add a touch of perfection, let him convey the  subtle tribute of a sense of the value of his subject by reflecting in  his design the artist's joy in his work.          PRINT AS AN INTERPRETER OF MEANING      The invention of printing, we have often been told, added to book  production only the two commercial elements of speed and cheapness. As  regards the book itself, we are assured, printing not only added  nothing, but, during the four and a half centuries of its development,  has constantly tended to take away. These statements are no doubt  historically and theoretically true, yet they are so unjust to the  present-day art that some supplementary statement of our obligations to  printing seems called for, aside from the obvious rejoinder that, even  if speed and cheapness are commercial qualities, they have reached a  development--especially in the newspaper--beyond the dreams of the most  imaginative fifteenth-century inventor, and have done nothing less than  revolutionize the world.    Taking the service of printing as it stands to-day, what does it  actually do for the reader? What is the great difference between the  printed word and even the best handwriting? It is obviously the  condensation and the absolute mechanical sameness of print. The  advantage of these differences to the eye in respect to rapid reading is  hardly to be overestimated. Let any one take a specimen of average  penmanship and note the time which he consumes in reading it; let him  compare with this the time occupied in reading the same number of  printed words, and the difference will be startling; but not even so  will it do justice to print, for handwriting average in quality is very  far from average in frequency. If it be urged that the twentieth-century  comparison should be between typewriting and print, we may reply that  typewriting _is_ print, though it lacks most of its condensation, and  that the credit for its superior legibility belongs to typography, of  which the new art is obviously a by-product. But we are not yet out of  the manuscript period, so far as private records are concerned, and it  still is true, as it has been for many generations, that print  multiplies the years of every scholar's and reader's life.    At this point we may even introduce a claim for print as a contributor  to literature. There are certainly many books of high literary standing  that never would have attained their present form without the  intervention of type. It is well known that Carlyle rewrote his books in  proof, so that the printer, instead of attempting to correct his  galleys, reset them outright. Balzac went a step further, and largely  wrote his novels in proof, if such an expression may be allowed. He so  altered and expanded them that what went to the printing office as copy  for a novelette finally came out of it a full-sized novel. Even where  the changes are not so extensive, as in the proof-sheets of the Waverley  Novels preserved in the Cornell University Library, it is interesting to  trace the alterations which the author was prompted to make by the sight  of his paragraphs clothed in the startling distinctness of print. Nor is  this at all surprising when one considers how much better the eye can  take in the thought and style of a composition from the printed page  than it can even from typewriting. The advantage is so marked that some  publishers, before starting on an expensive literary venture, are  accustomed to have the copy set up on the linotype for the benefit of  their critics. If the work is accepted, the revisions are made on these  sheets, and then, finally, the work is sent back to the composing room  to receive the more elaborate typographic dress in which it is to  appear.    But to return to the advantages of type to the reader. Handwriting can  make distinctions, such as punctuation and paragraphing, but print can  greatly enforce them. The meaning of no written page leaps out to the  eye; but this is the regular experience of the reader with every  well-printed page. While printing can do nothing on a single page that  is beyond the power of a skillful penman, its ordinary resources are the  extraordinary ones of manuscript. It might not be physically impossible,  for instance, to duplicate with a pen a page of the Century Dictionary,  but it would be practically impossible, and, if the pen were our only  resource, we never should have such a marvel of condensation and  distinctness as that triumph of typography in the service of  scholarship.    In ordinary text, printing has grown away from the distinctions to the  eye that were in vogue two hundred years ago--a gain to art and perhaps  to legibility also, though contemporary critics like Franklin lamented  the change--but in reference books we have attained to a finer skill in  making distinctions to the eye than our forefathers achieved with all  their typographic struggles. Nor are our reference pages lacking in  beauty. But our familiarity with works of this class tends to obscure  their wonderful merit as time-savers and eye-savers. It is only when we  take up some foreign dictionary, printed with little contrast of type,  perhaps in German text, and bristling with unmeaning abbreviations, that  we appreciate our privilege. Surely this is a marvelous mechanical  triumph, to present the words of an author in such a form that the eye,  to take it in, needs but to sweep rapidly down the page, or, if it  merely glances at the page, it shall have the meaning of the whole so  focused in a few leading words that it can turn at once to the passage  sought, or see that it must look elsewhere. The saving of time so  effected may be interpreted either as a lengthening of life or as an  increased fullness of life, but it means also a lessening of friction  and thus an addition to human comfort.    We have been speaking of prose; but print has done as much or more to  interpret the meaning of poetry. We have before us a facsimile of  nineteen lines from the oldest Vatican manuscript of Vergil. The  hexameters are written in single lines; but this is the only help to the  eye. The letters are capitals and are individually very beautiful,  indeed, the lines are like ribbons of rich decoration; but the words are  not separated, and the punctuation is inconspicuous and primitively  simple, consisting merely of faint dots. Modern poetry, especially  lyric, with its wealth and interplay of rhyme, affords a fine  opportunity for the printer to mediate between the poet and his public,  and this he has been able to do by mere indention and leading, without  resorting to distinction of type. The reader of a sonnet or ballad  printed without these two aids to the eye is robbed of his rightful  clues to the construction of the verse. It seems hardly possible that a  poem could have been read aloud from an ancient manuscript, at sight,  with proper inflection; yet this is just what printing can make possible  for the modern reader. It has not usually done so, for the printer has  been very conservative; he has taken his conception of a page from  prose, and, not being compelled to, has not placed all the resources of  his art at the service of the poet. Accents, pauses, and certain  arbitrary signs might well be employed to indicate to the reader the  way the poet meant his line to be read. Milton curiously gave us some  metric hints by means of changes in spelling, but we have to read all  our other poets in the light of our own discernment, and it is not to be  wondered at if doctors disagree. Even the caesura, or pause in the  course of a long line, is not always easy to place. Francis Thompson, in  his poem \"A Judgement in Heaven,\" has indicated this by an asterisk,  giving an example that might well be followed by other poets and their  printers. The regularity of eighteenth-century verse made little call  for guide-posts, but modern free meter, in proportion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#3)"],[1,"these  books right back along. I'm goin' to start a libery thar, and these  books will just fit me, name and all. Just you sort out all that have  that shield and name, and send them round to the Langham at seven sharp.  I'll be round to settle up; but see, now, don't you send any without  that name-plate, for that's my name, too, and I reckon this old hoss  with the daggers and roosters might have been related to me some way.'    'I remember,' says the Marquis d'Argenson, in his 'Memoires,' 'once  paying a visit to a well-known bibliomaniac, who had just purchased an  extremely scarce volume, quoted at a fabulous price. Having been  graciously permitted by its owner to inspect the treasure, I ventured  innocently to remark that he had probably bought it with the  philanthropic intention of having it reprinted. \"Heaven forbid!\" he  exclaimed in a horrified tone; \"how could you suppose me capable of such  an act of folly! If I were, the book would be no longer scarce, and  would have no value whatever. Besides,\" he added, \"I doubt, between  ourselves, if it be worth reprinting.\" \"In that case,\" said I, \"its  rarity appears to be its only attraction.\" \"Just so,\" he complacently  replied; \"and that is quite enough for me.\"'    Another type which borders dangerously near to that which we have been  describing is the collector who, not necessarily ignorant, collects for  himself alone. The motto which Grolier adopted and acted upon--'Io  Grolierii et amicorum'--might have been a very safe principle to go upon  in the sixteenth century, but it would most certainly fail in the  nineteenth, when one's dearest friends are the most unmitigated  book-thieves. But perhaps even the too frequent loss of books is an evil  to be preferred to the egoistical meanness of the selfish collector.  Balzac gives in his 'Cousin Pons' a vivid delineation of such a person.  The hero is a poor drudging music-teacher and orchestra-player, who has  invested every franc of his hard-won earnings in the collecting of  exquisite paintings, prints, bric-a-brac, and other rare mementoes of  the eighteenth century. Despised by all, even by his kindred, trodden  upon as a nobody, slow, patient, and ever courageous, he unites to a  complete technical knowledge a marvellous intuition of the beautiful,  and his treasures are for him pride, bliss, and life. There is no show  in this case, no desire for show, no ambition of the despicable  shoddy-genteel sort--a more than powerful creation of fiction. A  strikingly opposite career of selfishness is suggested by the fairly  well-known story of Don Vincente, the friar bookseller of Barcelona,  who, in order to obtain a volume which a rival bookseller, Paxtot, had  secured at an auction, set fire one night to Paxtot's shop, and stole  the precious volume--a supposed unique copy of the 'Furs e ordinacions  fetes per los gloriosos reys de Arago als regnicoes del regne de  Valencia,' printed by Lambert Palmart, 1482. When the friar was brought  up for judgment, he stolidly maintained his innocence, asserting that  Paxtot had sold it to him after the auction. Further inquiry resulted in  the discovery that Don Vincente possessed a number of books which had  been purchased from him by customers who were shortly afterwards found  assassinated. It was only after receiving a formal promise that his  library should not be dispersed, but preserved in its integrity, that he  determined to make a clean breast of it, and confess the details of the  crimes that he had committed. In cross-examination, Don Vincente spurned  the suggestion that he was a thief, for had he not given back to his  victims the money which they had paid him for the books?    'And it was solely for the sake of books that you committed these  murders?' asked the judge.    'Books! yes, books! Books are the glory of God!'    Vincente's counsel, in defence of his client, in this desperate strait  maintained that there might exist several copies of the books found in  his possession, and that it was out of the question to condemn, on his  own sham avowal, a man who appeared to be half cracked. The counsel for  the prosecution said that that plea could not be urged in the case of  the book printed by Lambert Palmart, as but one copy of that was in  existence. But the prisoner's counsel retorted by putting in evidence  attested affirmation that a second copy was in France.    Up to this moment Vincente had maintained an imperturbable calm; but on  hearing his counsel's plea he burst into tears. In the end, Don Vincente  was condemned to be strangled, and when asked if he had anything more to  urge, all he could utter, sobbing violently, was, 'Ah! your worship,  _my copy was not unique_!'    Cousin Pons and Don Vincente are extreme instances of bibliomaniacs to  whom the possession of a book was the supreme happiness of life. The man  of Fiction and the man of Fact were at one in this passion of  acquisitiveness. Don Vincente was compelled by hunger--_mala suada  fames_--to become a book _seller_; and if it became a general rule for  book-collectors to become booksellers there would, we venture to think,  be a very material increase in police-court and, perhaps, criminal cases  generally. Mr. G. A. Sala tells us an amusing story of the late  Frederick Guest Tomlins, a historian and journalist of repute. In the  autumn of his life Tomlins decided to set up as a bookseller. He  purposed to deal chiefly in mediaeval literature, in which he was  profoundly versed. The venture was scarcely successful. A customer  entered his shop one day and asked for a particular book, as marked in  the catalogue. 'I had really no idea it was there,' meditatively  remarked Mr. Tomlins, as he ascended a ladder to a very high shelf and  pulled out a squabby little tome. Then he remained about five-and-twenty  minutes on the ladder absorbed in the perusal of the volume, when the  customer, growing impatient, began to rap on the counter with his stick.  Thereupon Mr. Tomlins came down the ladder. 'If you think,' he remarked,  with calm severity, to the intending purchaser, 'that any considerations  of vile dross will induce me to part with this rare and precious little  volume, you are very much mistaken. It is like your impudence. Be off  with you!' A not altogether dissimilar anecdote is related by Lord  Lytton in that curious novel 'Zanoni,' in which one of the characters is  an old bookseller who, after years of toil, succeeded in forming an  almost perfect library of works on occult philosophy. Poor in everything  but a genuine love for the mute companions of his old age, he was  compelled to keep open his shop, and trade, as it were, in his own  flesh. Let a customer enter, and his countenance fell; let him depart  empty-handed, and he would smile gaily, oblivious for a time of bare  cupboard and inward cravings.    _A propos_ of a literary man turning bookseller, the experiment has  often been tried, but it has generally failed. Second-hand bookselling  seems to be a frequent experiment after the failures of other trades  and callings. We have known grocers, greengrocers, coal-dealers,  pianoforte-makers, printers, bookbinders, cheap-jacks, in London, adopt  the selling of books as a means of livelihood. Sometimes--and several  living examples might be cited--the experiment is a success, but  frequently a failure. The knowledge of old books is not picked up in a  month or a year. The misfortune which seems to dog the footsteps of many  men in every move they make, does not fail to pursue them in  bookselling. Some of them might almost say with Fulmer, in Cumberland's  'West Indian' (1771): 'I have beat through every quarter of the  compass . . . I have blustered for prerogatives, I have bellowed for  freedom, I have offered to serve my country, I have engaged to betray  it . . . I have talked treason, writ treason. . . . And here I set up as  a bookseller, but men leave off reading, and if I were to turn butcher I  believe they'd leave off eating.'    There can be no doubt about the fact that Englishmen as a rule do not  attach sufficient importance to book-buying. If the better-class  tradesman, or professional man, spends a few pounds at Christmas or on  birthday occasions, he feels that he has become a patron of literature.  How many men, who are getting L1,000 a year, spend L1 per month on  books? The library of the average middle-class person is in ninety-nine  cases out of a hundred the cruelest possible commentary on his  intelligence, and, as a matter of fact, if it contains a couple of  volumes worthy of the name of books, their presence is more often than  not an accidental one. A few volumes of the _Sunday at Home_, the  _Leisure Hour_, _Cassell's Magazine_, or perhaps a few other monthly  periodicals, carefully preserved during the twelve months of their  issue, and bound up at the end of the year--with such stuff as this is  the average Englishman's bookcase filled. Mark Pattison has gone so far  as to declare that while the aggregate wealth of the United Kingdom is  many times more than it was one hundred and fifty years ago, the circle  of book-buyers, of the lovers of literature, is certainly not larger, if  it be not absolutely smaller. It may be urged that a person with L1,000  per annum as income usually spends L100 in rent, and that the  accommodation which can be got for that amount does not permit of one  room being devoted to library purposes. This may be true, but this  explanation is not a valid excuse, for a set of shelves, 13 feet by 10  feet 6 inches, placed against a wall will accommodate nearly one  thousand octavo volumes--the genius of the world can be pressed into a  hundred volumes. An American has advised his readers to 'own all the  books you can, use all the books you own, and as many more as you can  get.' The advice is good, and it is well to remember that by far the  majority of great book-collectors have lived to a ripe old"]]]
