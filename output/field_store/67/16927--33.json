Similar looms are still used for mat making  by the Egyptian fellah.      VERTICAL LOOMS.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Upright or vertical loom. Wilkinson's  _Ancient Egyptians_, London, John Murray. 1st ed., Vol. III., p. 135.]    Apart from the horizontal loom Wilkinson and Robert Hay[C] also  recorded the existence of an illustration of an upright loom, said in  error to be at Eileithyias (El Kab). Wilkinson's copy, Fig. 13, is  more elaborate than that of Hay. Mr. Davies informs me that the  original is not at Eileithyias, but in the tomb of Nefer-hotep at  Thebes. Wilkinson in regard to this illustration quotes the  oft-repeated statement of Herodotus (_circa_ 460-455 B.C.) in  reference to looms in general:--\"Other nations make cloth by pushing  the woof upwards, the Egyptians on the contrary, press it down.\" On  this statement Wilkinson remarks: \"This is confirmed by the paintings  which represent the process of making cloth; but at Thebes, a man who  is engaged in making a piece of cloth with a coloured border or  selvedge, appears to push the woof upwards, the cloth being fixed  above him, to the upper part of the frame\" [Fig. 13]. But I am unable  to follow Wilkinson in this, for I can find no indication in his  illustration which shows how the beating-in of the weft is  accomplished. From the illustration all one can say is that it might  have been done either way. Wilkinson's illustration is lettered from  _a_ to _p_ but this lettering is not explained by him at all,  excepting in the case of the letter _k_, of which he says: \"_k_ is a  shuttle, not thrown, but put in with the hand. It had a hook at the  end ...\" and he proceeds to refer to the drawing elsewhere of the  horizontal loom. He does not show the hooks in his illustration. In  Fig. 14, I give the sketch made by Mr. N. de G. Davies of the remains  of the original from which Wilkinson made his illustration.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies, Jan. 1913, of  an Upright Loom in Tomb 49 at Thebes, belonging to Nefer-hotep, at end  of XVIII. Dynasty, B.C. 1330. Drawn when in a better state by  Wilkinson, Fig. 13, and Hay.]    A more satisfactory drawing of upright looms is that which Mr. N. de  G. Davies has placed at my disposal for reproduction here. I append  his description, Fig. 9. \"The picture of men working at two looms is  taken from the tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, who was a royal scribe  in the middle of the 18th Dynasty, _circa_ 1425 B.C. In his tomb his  house is shown. He himself sits in the hall, while inside some  servants spin and weave, make bread, store the grain, etc. The roof of  the chambers is supported on pillars, and between two of these the  looms are set up which are here depicted. They are not attached  however, either to the roof or the pillars. Faint sketching lines are  mixed up with the darker reds in which the picture was re-drawn, and  the whole very simply and carelessly executed. I have found it  difficult to make it clear. In my sketch the first faint sketching  outlines appear as lines. The more solid red lines which replaced  these I have 'hatched,' and certain portions including the men's flesh  colour, the stools, the discs I have put in solid black, partly  because they are for the most part more solid and dark red in the  original, and partly to distinguish the portions more clearly from one  another. The horizontal lines which cross the web are very faintly  drawn and almost as good as obliterated by the white paint which had  been put on the web. I have put them in just to show that the bars  were _conceived_ of as passing behind or under the web and concealed  by it.    \"The larger loom is worked by two men, the smaller by one man only.  The looms consist of an oblong frame A set up on two stones B. The  warp is attached to the warp beam C on top and the breast beam D at  the bottom. The threads of the warp are not shown, no difference being  made between any woven part and the warp threads; to all is given one  smear of white paint. Two discs E are seen hanging against the frame  posts, one on each side, the earlier sketch showing a larger disc than  the final drawing in dark red.    \"Two slender laze rods F are shown on the large loom and heavy bars G,  H, lower down; a somewhat similar laze rod and beams are also shown on  the smaller loom.    \"The weavers sit on benches with their backs to the spectator. The  artist has not dared to draw a back view of their heads, but has  turned each man's head to the right to show a profile. They are  holding a heavy looking rod which looks like a 'beater-in.' One would  expect to see a shuttle but perhaps this was too small an object for  so rough a picture--perhaps the man at the smaller loom holds an  exaggerated shuttle L in his right hand.    \"The lines M seen alongside the framework are the faint red sketch  lines _not_ cords. The diagonal line N on the left I do not  understand, it does not seem an accidental one.    \"On the left hand of the two looms the original shows a man spinning  coarse thread into finer(?) using two spindles at once; the threads  pass through rings fixed in the ceiling as in a picture at Beni Hasan.  Behind him two girls are breaking up the flax and two others are  making coarse threads of the fibres, almost exactly like those in the  tomb of Daga (No. 103) a couple of hundred yards away.\"    To this description of Mr. Davies I would like to add a word about  the discs E. Wilkinson indicates these as rings apparently joining the  horizontal beam to the post of the frame, the form of the ring being  arrived at as explained by Mr. Davies by the original outline of the  sketch having been made larger than the final drawing of the circle,  or disc, and not obliterated. In Mr. Davies' drawing these discs hang  on or are fixed on to the uprights only, and I am inclined to think  they represent balls of weft thread hanging up in the same way as we  see whole rows of coloured balls hanging on the looms of Persian  rugmakers, and as can be seen on an Indian rug loom in Bankfield  Museum.    It is also very clear that these Egyptian vertical looms are very  different from the Greek looms in so far as we know anything about  them. The Greek looms had an upper beam only and the warp threads were  bunched at the lower end and weighted with metal or clay balls to keep  them taut, Fig. 15. The _individual_ warp threads were not weighted;  they were bunched and then weighted. The pyramidal shaped clay warp  weights found in Egypt are I understand considered by Egyptologists to  belong to the Roman period, but in the Manchester University Museum  there is a mud article which Miss M. A. Murray describes as a warp  weight, Fig. 17, so that it is possible vertical looms with warp  weights may yet be forthcoming as an Egyptian and not a foreign  industrial tool. But Dr. H. R. Hall informs me this weight was  probably found in the ruins of houses where AEgean pottery was found  and hence it is probably a temporary warp weight of those people and  not an Egyptian article.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Greek loom with spool and warp weights.  Illustration on a skyphos (van Branteghem vase in the Ashmolean  Museum, Oxford). From H. B. Walters' paper on _Odysseus & Kirke_ on a  Boeotian vase, Jour. Hellenic Studies, 1892-3 XIII. p. 81.]    Since writing the above Mr. N. de G. Davies has very kindly sent me on  a new set of illustrations, Fig. 16, of which he says; \"My attention  was called to the scene by Dr. Alan Gardiner. The scenes which  represent the preparation of the flax and the stretching of the warp  are almost replicas of those in the tomb of Daga of the Middle  Kingdom, so far as we can judge, while the pictures of the looms  resemble closely those in the tombs of Thot-nefer and Nefer-hotep. The  work is done by both men and women. Men prepare the flax while women  stretch the warp. Men mostly work the loom, either singly or with a  companion. But in one case a woman is seen at work at one of the  upright looms. She is shewn sitting sideways on the low bench and is  not pictured in a back view with widely spread legs like the men.  Unfortunately the work is so slovenly and so much injured that few  exact outlines can be secured, and hence all detail is insecure.  There are also superfluous lines in red colour which confuse the  picture. The tomb is Ramesside in date (_circa_ 1200 B.C.) The  inscription over the seated man is too broken to be read.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 16a.--Weavers at work as represented in the Tomb  of Nefer-ronpet, Superintendent of Weavers at Thebes. Date about 1200  B.C. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16b.--Weavers at work as represented in the Tomb  of Nefer-ronpet, Superintendent of Weavers at Thebes. Date about 1200  B.C. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies.]    The drawings appear to confirm generally what we have gathered from  Mr. Davies' previous illustration, Fig. 9.      PORTIONS OF LOOMS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US.    In so far as I know, not many loom parts have yet been discovered, and  those which I have had an opportunity of studying do not assist us to  much knowledge beyond that which we have gained by a study of the wall  paintings. We have the article from Kahun already mentioned, which may  possibly be a warp weight, as it somewhat resembles the later warp  weights found elsewhere. It is of hardened mud with a perforation at  the thin end through which a piece of string has been passed and  knotted (Fig. 17), but so far no illustration of a loom with weights  has been found, either for the period to which this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25735"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 09 1895 (#3)"],[1,"nt, Emil Lorch; Vice-President, G.H.

Few of the existing clubs have started under better auspices, and fewer  still could count as many members at their inception.    A number of the other clubs have begun early in the systematic work of  the year. The Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Chicago clubs in  particular are starting with unusual vigor and promise. Our next issue  will have more detailed account of these plans for the future.          [Illustration: Design by A.H.

With an      Historical Sketch. By H. Heathcote Statham, Fellow of the      Institute of Architects, Editor of _The Builder_. With      illustrations drawn by the Author. London, New York: Charles      Scribner's Sons. 1895.    This work is, as its title indicates, a popular handbook of the  principles of architecture, and furnishes what has hitherto been  practically inaccessible to general readers--a concise explanation of  what architecture really means.    The greater part of the work is devoted to the explanation of the theory  of design and construction and the general principles in their simpler  applications. The subject of ornament including the use of mouldings,  sculpture, and plain surfaces, is taken up, and architectural working  drawings are explained.    The historical sketch is excellent, although in this direction there is  not the same lack of good handbooks as in the theoretical field. The  analysis is clear and more easily comprehended than is usual in such  treatises.           *       *       *       *       *          Notes.      To an architect a convenient drawing table is one of the most important  requirements. There are many devices made to meet this requirement, but  none have proved more useful or given more general satisfaction than the  \"Seldis,\" furnished by Messrs. Frost & Adams, 37 Cornhill, Boston. The  special advantages of this table are many, but among them is the fact  that the draughtsman can work in a natural position, as the board can be  adjusted, so that all parts may be easily reached. Any board can be used  and it will not tip over, and being self-locking will remain in any  position, and can be adjusted in height to suit the draughtsman. When  not in use it can be folded to occupy the same length and width as an  ordinary drawing-board. Descriptive circulars will be sent upon  application by Messrs. Frost & Adams.          [Illustration: House in Brookline. Winslow & Wetherell,      Architects. From Dexter Bros.' \"Some Houses Near Boston.\"]      Messrs. Dexter Bros., of 55 Broad Street, Boston, are adopting a very  effective method of advertising their English Shingle Stains. We have  already referred to their collection of photographic prints published  under the title of \"Some Houses Near Boston.\" The illustration on this  page is reduced from one of the plates in this collection. They have  followed this with an even more attractive pamphlet showing  Kennebunkport houses, on which their stains have been used, and they  have a third collection in preparation, illustrating Bar Harbor houses.  Either of the first two will be sent to any reader of THE BROCHURE  SERIES upon receipt of a two-cent stamp, and due notice of the issue of  the collection of Bar Harbor houses will be given in these columns. As  Dexter Bros.' Stains are used by leading architects throughout the  country they have plenty of subjects to choose from in each publication,  thus enabling them to publish work that is architecturally interesting.  This raises the character of their advertising above the ordinary trade  level. Usually publications representing the buildings in which a  certain material is used, show good, bad, and indifferent architecture,  the good being present in small quantity. The Dexter Bros.' collections  show intelligent discrimination, and it is this one thing that makes  them worthy of notice.    All who are in any way interested in suburban architecture will find  these pamphlets worth sending for. They should have a wide circulation,  for they have more than an advertising value."]]]
