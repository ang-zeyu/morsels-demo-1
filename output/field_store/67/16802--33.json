I don't know much about boats except what  I'm told, but Tom Swift does. Now, if he bids, you people ought to know  that it's all right. I'm bid seventy--seventy I'm bid. Will any one  make it eighty?\"    \"Eighty!\" exclaimed Andy Foger after a whispered conference with Sam.  \"I know as much about boats as Tom Swift.  I'll make it eighty.\"    \"No side remarks. I'll do most of the talking. You just bid, young  man,\" remarked Mr. Wood. \"I have eighty bid for this boat--eighty  dollars. Why, my friends, I can't understand this.  I ought to have it  up to three hundred dollars, at least. But I thank you all the same. We  are coming on. I'm bid eighty--\"    \"Ninety!\" exclaimed the quiet man at Tom's elbow.  He was continually  fingering his upper lip, as though he had a mustache there, but his  face was clean-shaven.  He looked around nervously as he spoke.    \"Ninety!\" called out the auctioneer.    \"Ninety-five!\" returned Tom.  Andy Foger scowled at him, but the young  inventor only smiled.  It was evident that the bully did not relish  being bid against.  He and his crony whispered together again.    \"One hundred!\" called Andy, as if no one would dare go above that.    \"I'm offered an even hundred,\" resumed Mr. Wood.  \"We are certainly  coming on.  A hundred I am bid, a hundred--a hundred--a hundred--\"    \"And five,\" said the strange man hastily, and he seemed to choke as he  uttered the words.    \"Oh, come now; we ought to have at least ten-dollar bids from now on,\"  suggested Mr. Wood.  \"Won't you make it a hundred and ten?\" The  auctioneer looked directly at the man, who seemed to shrink back into  the crowd.  He shook his head, cast a sort of despairing look at the  boat and hurried away.    \"That's queer,\" murmured Tom.  \"I guess that was his limit, yet if he  wanted the boat badly that wasn't a high price.\"    \"Who's going ahead of me?\" demanded Andy in loud tones.    \"Keep quiet!\" urged Sam.  \"We may get it yet.\"    \"Yes, don't make so many remarks,\" counseled the auctioneer.  \"I'm bid  a hundred and five.  Will any one make it a hundred and twenty-five?\"    Tom wondered why the man had not remained to see if his bid was  accepted, for no one raised it at once, but he hurried off and did not  look back.  Tom took a sudden resolve.    \"A hundred and twenty-five!\" he called out.    \"That's what I like to hear,\" exclaimed Mr. Wood.  \"Now we are doing  business.  A hundred and twenty-five from Tom Swift.  Will any one  offer me fifty?\"    Andy and Sam seemed to be having some dispute.    \"Let's make him quit right now,\" suggested Andy in a hoarse whisper.    \"You can't,\" declared Sam'    \"Yes, I can.  I'll go up to my limit right now.\"    \"And some one will go above you---maybe Tom will,\" was Sam's retort.    \"I don't believe he can afford to,\" Andy came back with.  \"I'm going to  call his bluffs.  I believe he's only bidding to make others think he  wants it.  I don't believe he'll buy it.\"    Tom heard what was said, but did not reply.  The auctioneer was calling  monotonously: \"I'm bid a hundred and twenty-five--twenty-five.  Will  any one make it fifty?\"    \"A hundred and fifty!\" sang out Andy, and all eyes were directed toward  him.    \"Sixty!\" said Tom quietly.    \"Here, you--\" began the red-haired lad.  \"You--\"    \"That will do!\" exclaimed the auctioneer sternly.  \"I am offered a  hundred and sixty.  Now who will give me an advance? I want to get the  boat up to two hundred, and then the real bidding will begin.\"    Tom's heart sank.  He hoped it would be some time before a two hundred  dollar offer would be heard.  As for Andy Foger, he was almost  speechless with rage.  He shook off the restraining arm of Sam, and,  worming his way to the front of the throng, exclaimed:    \"I'll give a hundred and seventy-five dollars for that boat!\"    \"Good!\" cried the auctioneer.  \"That's the way to talk.  I'm offered a  hundred and seventy-five.\"    \"Eighty,\" said Tom quietly, though his heart was beating fast.    \"Well, of all--\" began Andy, but Sam Snedecker dragged him back.    \"You haven't got any more money,\" said the bully's crony.  \"Better stop  now.\"    \"I will not! I'm going home for more,\" declared Andy.  \"I must have  that boat.\"    \"It will be sold when you get back,\" said Sam.    \"Haven't you got any money you can lend me?\" inquired the squint-eyed  one, scowling in Tom's direction.  \"No, not a bit.  There, some one  raised Tom's bid.\"    At that moment a man in the crowd offered a hundred and eighty-one  dollars.    \"Small amounts thankfully received,\" said Mr. Wood with a laugh.  Then  the bidding became lively, a number making one-dollar advances.    The price got up to one hundred and ninety-five dollars and there it  hung for several minutes, despite the eloquence of Mr. Wood, who tried  by all his persuasive powers to get a substantial advance.  But every  one seemed afraid to bid.  As for the young inventor, he was in a  quandary.  He could only offer five dollars more, and, if he bid it in  a lump, some one might go to two hundred and five, and he would not get  the boat.  He wished he had secured permission from his father to go  higher, yet he knew that as a fair proposition two hundred dollars was  about all the motor-boat in its present condition was worth, at least  to him.  Then he made a sudden resolve.  He thought he might as well  have the suspense over.    \"Two hundred dollars!\" he called boldly.    \"I'm offered two hundred!\" repeated Mr. Wood.  \"That is something like  it.  Now who will raise that?\"    There was a moment of silence.  Then the auctioneer swung into an  enthusiastic description of the boat.  He begged for an advance, but  none was made, though Tom's heart seemed in his throat, so afraid was  he that he would not get the CARLOPA.    \"Two hundred--two hundred!\" droned on Mr. Wood. \"I am offered two  hundred. Will any of you go any higher?\" He paused a moment, and Tom's  heart beat harder than ever. \"If not,\" resumed the speaker, \"I will  declare the bidding closed. Are you all done?  Once--twice--three  times. Two hundred dollars. Going--going--gone!\" He clapped his hands.  \"The boat is sold to Thomas Swift for two hundred dollars. If he'll  step up I'll take his money.\"    There was a laugh as Tom, blushingly, advanced.  He passed Andy Foger,  who had worked his way over near him.    \"You got the boat,\" sneered the bully, \"and I s'pose you think you got  ahead of me.\"    \"Keep quiet!\" begged Sam.    \"I won't!\" exclaimed Andy.  \"He outbid me just out of spite, and I'll  get even with him.  You see if I don't!\"    Tom looked Andy Foger straight in the eyes, but did not answer, and the  red-haired youth turned aside, followed by his crony, and started  toward his automobile.    \"I congratulate you on your bargain,\" said Mr. Wood as Tom proceeded to  make out a check.  He gave little thought to the threat Andy Foger had  made, but the time was coming when he was to remember it well.          CHAPTER III    A TIMELY WARNING      \"Well, are you satisfied with your bargain, Tom?\" asked Mr. Wood when  the formalities about transferring the ownership of the motor-boat had  been completed.    \"Oh, yes, I calculated to pay just what I did.\"    \"I'm glad you're satisfied, for Mr. Hastings told me to be sure the  purchaser was satisfied.  Here he comes now.  I guess he wasn't at the  auction.\"    An elderly gentleman was approaching Mr. Wood and Tom.  Most of the  throng was dispersing, but the young inventor noticed that Andy Foger  and Sam Snedecker stood to one side, regarding him closely.    \"So you got my boat,\" remarked the former owner of the craft.  \"I hope  you will be able to fix it up.\"    \"Oh, I think I shall,\" answered the new owner of the CARLOPA.  \"If I  can't, father will help me.\"    \"Yes, you have an advantage there.  Are you going to keep the same  name?\" and Mr. Hastings seemed quite interested in what answer the lad  would make.    \"I think not,\" replied Tom.  \"It's a good name, but I want something  that tells more what a fast boat it is, for I'm going to make some  changes that will increase the speed.\"    \"That's a good idea. Call it the Swift.\"    \"Folks would say I was stuck up if I did that,\" retorted the youth  quickly.  \"I think I shall call it the ARROW.  That's a good, short  name, and--\"    \"It's certainly speedy,\" interrupted Mr. Hastings.  \"Well now, since  you're not going to use the name CARLOPA, would you mind if I took it  for my new boat? I have a fancy for it.\"    \"Not in the least,\" said Tom.  \"Don't you want the letters from each  side of the bow to put on your new craft?\"    \"It's very kind of you to offer them, and, since you will have no need  for them, I'll be glad to take them off.\"    \"Come down to my boat,\" invited Tom, using the word \"my\" with a proper  pride, \"and I'll take off the brass letters.  I have a screw driver in  my motor-cycle tool bag.\"    As the former and present owners of the ARROW (which is the name by  which I shall hereafter designate Tom's motor-boat) walked down toward  the dock where it was moored the young inventor gave a startled cry.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Hastings.    \"That man! See him at my motor-boat?\" cried Tom.  He pointed to the  craft in the lake.  A man was in the cockpit and seemed to be doing  something to the forward bulkhead, which closed off the compartment  holding the gasoline tank.    \"Who is he?\" asked Mr. Hastings, while Tom started on a run toward the  boat.    \"I don't know.  Some man who bid on the boat at the auction, but who  didn't go high enough,\" answered the lad.  As he neared the craft the  man sprang out, ran along the lakeshore for a short distance and then  disappeared amid the bushes which bordered the estate of Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22748"],[0,"Explanation of Terms Used in Entomology (#3)"],[1,"are fitted for  walking only; Phasmids.
