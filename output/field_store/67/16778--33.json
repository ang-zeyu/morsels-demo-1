Thus  Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (p. 1004), in attempting  to give a list of the playhouses which had been erected \"within London  and the suburbs,\" begins with the statement, \"Five inns, or common  osteryes, turned to playhouses.\" These five were the Bell and the  Cross Keys, hard by each other in Gracechurch Street, the Bull, in  Bishopsgate Street, the Bell Savage, on Ludgate Hill, and the Boar's  Head, in Whitechapel Street without Aldgate.[2]    [Footnote 2: All historians of the drama have confused this great  carriers' inn with the Boar's Head in Eastcheap made famous by  Falstaff. The error seems to have come from the _Analytical Index of  the Remembrancia_, which (p. 355) incorrectly catalogues the letter of  March 31, 1602, as referring to the \"Boar's Head in Eastcheap.\" The  letter itself, however, when examined, gives no indication whatever of  Eastcheap, and other evidence shows conclusively that the inn was  situated in Whitechapel just outside of Aldgate.]    Although Flecknoe referred to the Order of the Common Council as a  \"banishment,\" it did not actually drive the players from the city.  They were able, through the intervention of the Privy Council, and on  the old excuse of rehearsing plays for the Queen's entertainment, to  occupy the inns for a large part of each year.[3] John Stockwood, in a  sermon preached at Paul's Cross, August 24, 1578, bitterly complains  of the \"eight ordinary places\" used regularly for plays, referring, it  seems, to the five inns and the three playhouses--the Theatre,  Curtain, and Blackfriars--recently opened to the public.    [Footnote 3: See especially _The Acts of the Privy Council_ and _The  Remembrancia_ of the City of London.]    Richard Reulidge, in _A Monster Lately Found Out and Discovered_  (1628), writes that \"soon after 1580\" the authorities of London  received permission from Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council \"to  thrust the players out of the city, and to pull down all playhouses  and dicing-houses within their liberties: which accordingly was  effected; and the playhouses in Gracious Street [i.e., the Bell and  the Cross Keys], Bishopsgate Street [i.e., the Bull], that nigh Paul's  [i.e., Paul's singing school?], that on Ludgate Hill [i.e., the Bell  Savage], and the Whitefriars[4] were quite put down and suppressed by  the care of these religious senators.\"    [Footnote 4: There is some error here. The city had no jurisdiction  over Whitefriars, or Blackfriars either; but there was a playhouse in  Blackfriars at the time, and it was suppressed in 1584, though not by  the city authorities. Possibly Reulidge should have written  \"Whitechapel.\"]    [Illustration: MAP OF LONDON SHOWING THE INN-PLAYHOUSES    1. The Bell Savage; 2. The Cross Keys; 3. The Bell; 4. The Bull; 5.  The Boar's Head.]    Yet, in spite of what Reulidge says, these five inns continued to be  used by the players for many years.[5] No doubt they were often used  surreptitiously. In _Martin's Month's Mind_ (1589), we read that a  person \"for a penie may have farre better [entertainment] by oddes at  the Theatre and Curtaine, and _any blind playing house_ everie  day.\"[6] But the more important troupes were commonly able, through  the interference of the Privy Council, to get official permission to  use the inns during a large part of each year.    [Footnote 5: _The Remembrancia_ shows that the inn-playhouses remained  for many years as sharp thorns in the side of the puritanical city  fathers.]    [Footnote 6: Grosart, _Nash_, I, 179.]    There is not enough material about these early inn-playhouses to  enable one to write their separate histories. Below, however, I have  recorded in chronological order the more important references to them  which have come under my observation.    1557. On September 5 the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of  London \"that some of his officers do forthwith repair to the Boar's  Head without Aldgate, where, the Lords are informed, a lewd play  called _A Sackful of News_ shall be played this day,\" to arrest the  players, and send their playbook to the Council.[7]    [Footnote 7: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VI, 168.]    1573. During this year there were various fencing contests held at the  Bull in Bishopsgate.[8]    [Footnote 8: W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235.]    1577. In February the Office of the Revels made a payment of 10_d._  \"ffor the cariadge of the parts of ye well counterfeit from the Bell  in gracious strete to St. Johns, to be performed for the play of  _Cutwell_.\"[9]    [Footnote 9: A. Feuillerat, _Documents Relating to the Office of the  Revels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth_, p. 277.]    1579. On June 23 James Burbage was arrested for the sum of L5 13_d._  \"as he came down Gracious Street towards the Cross Keys there to a  play.\" The name of the proprietor of this inn-playhouse is preserved  in one of the interrogatories connected with the case: \"Item. Whether  did you, John Hynde, about xiii years past, in _anno_ 1579, the xxiii  of June, about two of the clock in the afternoon, send the sheriff's  officer unto the Cross Keys in Gratious Street, being then the  dwelling house of Richard Ibotson, citizen and brewer of London,\"  etc.[10] Nothing more, I believe, is known of this person.    [Footnote 10: Burbage _v._ Brayne, printed in C.W. Wallace, _The First  London Theatre_, pp. 82, 90. Whether Burbage was going to the Cross  Keys as a spectator or as an actor is not indicated; but the  presumption is that he was then playing at the inn, although he was  proprietor of the Theatre.]    1579. Stephen Gosson, in _The Schoole of Abuse_, writes favorably of  \"the two prose books played at the Bell Savage, where you shall find  never a word without wit, never a line without pith, never a letter  placed in vain; the _Jew_ and _Ptolome_, shown at the Bull ... neither  with amorous gesture wounding the eye, nor with slovenly talk hurting  the ears of the chast hearers.\"[11]    [Footnote 11: Arber's _English Reprints_, p. 40.]    1582. On July 1 the Earl of Warwick wrote to the Lord Mayor requesting  the city authorities to \"give license to my servant, John David, this  bearer, to play his profest prizes in his science and profession of  defence at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or some other convenient place to  be assigned within the liberties of London.\" The Lord Mayor refused to  allow David to give his fencing contest \"in an inn, which was somewhat  too close for infection, and appointed him to play in an open place of  the Leaden Hall,\" which, it may be added, was near the Bull.[12]    [Footnote 12: See The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 55-57.]    1583. William Rendle, in _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235, states  that in this year \"Tarleton, Wilson, and others note the stay of the  plague, and ask leave to play at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or the Bell  in Gracechurch Street,\" citing as his authority merely \"City MS.\" The  Privy Council on November 26, 1583, addressed to the Lord Mayor a  letter requesting \"that Her Majesty's Players [i.e., Tarleton, Wilson,  etc.] may be suffered to play within the liberties as heretofore they  have done.\"[13] And on November 28 the Lord Mayor issued to them a  license to play \"at the sign of the Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and  the sign of the Bell in Gracious Street, and nowhere else within this  City.\"[14]    [Footnote 13: See _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's  _Collections_, I, 66.]    [Footnote 14: C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 11.]    1587. \"James Cranydge played his master's prize the 21 of November,  1587, at the Bellsavage without Ludgate, at iiij sundry kinds of  weapons.... There played with him nine masters.\"[15]    [Footnote 15: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by J.O. Halliwell in  his edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. The Bell Savage seems to have  been especially patronized by fencers. George Silver, in his _Paradoxe  of Defence_ (1599), tells how he and his brother once challenged two  Italian fencers to a contest \"to be played at the Bell Savage upon the  scaffold, when he that went in his fight faster back than he ought,  should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold.\"]    Before 1588. In _Tarlton's Jests_[16] we find a number of references  to that famous actor's pleasantries in the London inns used by the  Queen's Players. It is impossible to date these exactly, but Tarleton  became a member of the Queen's Players in 1583, and he died in 1588.    [Footnote 16: First printed in 1611; reprinted by J.O. Halliwell for  The Shakespeare Society in 1844.]         At the Bull in Bishops-gate-street, where the Queen's       Players oftentimes played, Tarleton coming on the stage, one       from the gallery threw a pippin at him.         There was one Banks, in the time of Tarleton, who served the       Earl of Essex, and had a horse of strange qualities; and       being at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street getting money       with him, as he was mightily resorted to. Tarleton then,       with his fellows playing at the Bell by, came into the Cross       Keys, amongst many people, to see fashions.         At the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the Fifth.    The several \"jests\" which follow these introductory sentences indicate  that the inn-yards differed in no essential way from the early public  playhouses.    1588. \"John Mathews played his master's prize the 31 day of January,  1588, at the Bell Savage without Ludgate.\"[17]    [Footnote 17: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by Halliwell in his  edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. There is some difficulty with the  date. One of the \"masters\" before whom the prize was played was  \"Rycharde Tarlton,\" whom Halliwell takes to be the famous actor of  that name; but Tarleton the actor died on September 3, 1588.

Then sounds from the dancers below, the shrill  laughter of the women mingled with the strum of the banjo and the wheezy  accordion seemed to disturb the dog's slumber, and he would again pace  up and down at the lady's heels.    At times there would come a lull in the tumult, and the click of the  glasses or crash of a fallen pitcher would make a variety of  entertainment for the lady and her dog on the upper deck; but the short  and dusky midnight was well passed before the dancing ceased and partial  quiet and order were restored.    Two figures remained near the stern of the boat. One, a young woman with  a profusion of long auburn hair, the other a man with flushed face and  thick breath.    \"I cannot tell now which one it will be,\" said the girl coquettishly,  \"but if you wait you will see.\"    \"No more waitin' in it,\" he growled. \"I have waited long enough, and too  long, and you must choose between us now. You know we will soon be at  'Five Fingers,' and you must be good or they may get you,\" with a wicked  leer and clutch at her arm calculated to startle her as she carelessly  sat on the deck rail.    \"I'm not afraid of 'Five Fingers' or any other fingers, and I'm not  afraid of your two hands either,\" making her muscles very tense, and  sitting rigidly upright, \"and you can't scare me a bit; I'll do as I  like, so there!\"    By this time the moon shone high above the tops of the tall slender  pines, and spread its soft light over all the swift and swirling waters.  To the west, the hills faded first from green to blue, then to purple,  and lastly to black, silhouetted as they were against the quiet sky.    The swift flowing current pushed the waters up among the weeds and  bushes along the river's edge and the loose rocks were washed quite  smooth. Now and then might be heard the bark of a wood-chopper's dog  stationed outside his master's cabin, and the steady thud of the steamer  never stopped. At two o'clock it was growing light again, and still the  young man pleaded with the girl on the deck. She was stubborn and  silent.    Swiftly now the boat neared the \"Five Fingers.\" Only a few miles  remained before the huge boulders forming the narrow and tortuous  channels called the \"Five Fingers\" would be reached, and the face of the  pilot was stern. It was a most dangerous piece of water and many boats  had already been wrecked at this point.    Suddenly above the noise of the waters and the steamer's regular  breathing there arose on the quiet air a shrill shriek at the stern of  the boat.    The lady on the upper deck had retired. The captain was sleeping off his  too frequent potations, and only the pilot on the lookout knew that the  scream came from a woman; but it was not repeated.    The pilot's assistant was off watch, and his own duty lay at the wheel;  so it happened that a guilty man who had been standing by the deck rail  crept silently, unnoticed, and now thoroughly sobered, to his stateroom.    His companion was nowhere to be seen.    A small steamer following next day in the wake of the first boat, came  to Five Finger Rapids.    \"See the pretty red seaweed on the rocks, mamma,\" cried a little boy,  pointing to the low ledge on the bank of the east channel.    Those who looked in the direction indicated by the boy saw, as the  steamer crept carefully up to the whirlpool, a woman's white face in the  water, above which streamed a mass of long auburn hair, caught firmly on  the rocks.    Standing by the side of his pilot, the captain's keen eye caught sight  of the head and hair.    \"It's only Dolly Duncan,\" he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"No  one else has such hair; but it's no great loss anyway; there are many  more of such as she, you know.\"    [Illustration: UPPER YUKON STEAMER.]          CHAPTER III.    DAWSON.      By this time we had passed the Hootalingua, Big Salmon, Little Salmon  and Lewes rivers, and were nearing the mouth of Pelley River, all  flowing into one stream from the east and uniting to form the Upper  Yukon. Many smaller rivers and creeks from the west as well as the east  empty into this river which gathers momentum and volume constantly until  it reaches a swiftness of five miles an hour between Five Finger Rapids  and Fort Selkirk.    This latter fort is an old Canadian Post where mounted police and other  officers and soldiers are stationed. Never shall I forget my first  experience at Fort Selkirk. We arrived about one o'clock in the  afternoon and were told that our steamer would remain there an hour,  giving us all a chance to run about on shore for a change. Taking my  sunshade, and attracted by the wide green fields dotted with pretty wild  flowers of various colors, I rambled around alone for an hour, all the  time keeping our steamer in plain sight not many hundred yards away.  Curious to learn the meaning of a group of peculiar stakes driven into  the ground, some of which were surrounded by rude little fences, I made  my way in a narrow path through the deep grass to the place, and soon  discovered an Indian burial ground. There were, perhaps, twenty little  mounds or graves, a few much sunken below the level as if made long  years before, but all were marked in some manner by rude head boards.    These were notched, and had at one time been fancifully stained or  colored by the Ayan Indians, the stains and funny little inscriptions  being, for the most part, obliterated by the elements. Dainty wild roses  here nodded gracefully to each other, their pretty blooms being weighted  down at times by some venturesome, big honey bee or insolent fly; both  insects with many others, some of them unknown to me, buzzing  contentedly in the sunshine overhead.    Daisies and buttercups grew wild. Flowering beans and peas trailed their  sprays upon the ground. Blue bells, paint brush, and other posies fairly  bewildered me, so surprised was I to find them here in this far  Northland. Without this happiness and cheer given me by my sweet little  floral friends I might not have been so well prepared to endure the  rudeness that was awaiting me.    Upon my return to the steamer I found all in confusion. I could see no  signs of departure and no one of whom I cared to make inquiries. Men and  women were coming and going, but none appeared sober, while many with  flushed faces were loudly laughing and joking. A few Canadian police in  red coats scattered here and there were fully as rollicking as any,  and the steamer's captain and purser, arm in arm with a big, burly  Canadian official, were as drunk as bad liquor could well make them.    [Illustration: FIVE FINGER RAPIDS.]    Going to my stateroom I sat down to read, and, if possible, hide my  anxiety. As there was no window or other ventilator, and it was a warm  day, I could not close the door. While sitting thus the doorway was  darkened, and looking up I saw before me the drunken Canadian official,  leering at me with a horrible grin, and just about to speak.    At that instant there stepped to his side the tall form of the only  really sober man on board--the Seattle lawyer, who, in his most  dignified manner motioned the officer on, and he went; the gentlemanly  lawyer, tossing his half-consumed cigar overboard in an emphatic way as  if giving vent to his inward perturbation, marched moodily on. Catching  a glimpse of his face as he passed, I concluded that the situation was  fully as bad or worse than I had at first feared. Already we had been  several hours at Fort Selkirk and should have been miles on toward  Dawson.    The captain and crew were too drunk to know what they were doing, and  they were hourly growing more so. Many were gambling and drinking in the  salon or dining room and others came from the liquor store on shore a  few rods away. The voices of the women were keyed to the highest pitch  as they shouted with laughter at the rough jokes or losing games of the  men, while red-faced, perspiring waiters hurried back and forth with  trays laden with bottles and glasses. Now and then the crash of a fallen  pitcher or plate, followed by the shrieks of the women would reach me,  and looking through the great cracks in the board partition which was  the only thing separating me from the drunken crowd, I could see most of  the carousal, for such it now was.    My anxiety increased. I feared the danger of a night on board in a tiny  stateroom, without lock or weapon, and entirely alone.    \"Mr. H----,\" said I quietly, a little later, to the man from Seattle, as  I stepped up to him while he smoked near the deck rail. \"When do you  think the steamer will leave this place?\"    \"Tomorrow, most likely,\" in a tone of deep disgust.    \"Do you not think that the captain will push on tonight?\" I asked in  great anxiety.    \"I doubt if there is a man on board with enough sense left to run the  engine, and the captain--look there!\" pointing to a maudlin and  dishevelled Canadian wearing a captain's cap, and just then trying to  preserve his equilibrium on a wooden settle near the railing. \"It would  be a blessing if the brute tumbled overboard, and we were well rid of  him,\" said the gentleman savagely in a low tone. Then, seeing my  consternation, he added: \"I'll see what can be done, however,\" and I  returned to my room.    What should I do! I knew of no place of safety on shore for me during  the night if the steamer remained, and I dared not stay in my stateroom.  I had no revolver, no key to my door. I might be murdered before  morning, and my friends would never know what had become of me. There  was no one on board to whom I could appeal but the lawyer, and he might  be powerless to protect me in such a drunken rabble. With a prayer in my  heart I made my nerves as tense as possible and shut my teeth tightly  together. It was best to appear unconcerned. I did it. Suggesting away  all fright from my face I watched proceedings in the dining room through  the "]]]
