I would I were able to convince parents, and all who have the care of  youth, of the great attention they require, and how dangerous it is to  let them be for any length of time from under their eye, or to suffer  them to be without some kind of employment. This negligence is the ruin  of multitudes of girls.    How greatly it is to be lamented, that mothers who are inclined to  piety, should pervert even the means of salvation to their  destruction--commit the greatest irregularities while apparently  pursuing that which should produce the most regular and circumspect  conduct.    Thus, because they experience certain gains in prayer, they would be  all day long at church; meanwhile their children are running to  destruction. We glorify God most when we prevent what may offend Him.  What must be the nature of that sacrifice which is the occasion of sin!  God should be served in His own way. Let the devotion of mothers be  regulated so as to prevent their daughters from straying. Treat them as  sisters, not as slaves. Appear pleased with their little amusements.  The children will delight then in the presence of their mothers,  instead of avoiding it. If they find so much happiness with them, they  will not dream of seeking it elsewhere. Mothers frequently deny their  children any liberties. Like birds constantly confined to a cage, they  no sooner find means of escape than off they go, never to return. In  order to render them tame and docile when young, they should be  permitted sometimes to take wing, but as their flight is weak, and  closely watched, it is easy to retake them when they escape. Little  flight gives them the habit of naturally returning to their cage which  becomes an agreeable confinement. I believe young girls should be  treated in a manner something similar to this. Mothers should indulge  them in an innocent liberty, but should never lose sight of them.    To guard the tender minds of children from what is wrong, much care  should be taken to employ them in agreeable and useful matters. They  should not be loaded with food they cannot relish. Milk suited to  babies should be administered to them not strong meat which may so  disgust them, that when they arrive at an age when it would be proper  nourishment, they will not so much as taste it. Every day they should  be obliged to read a little in some good book, spend some time in  prayer, which must be suited rather to stir the affections, than for  meditation. Oh, were this method of education pursued, how speedily  would many irregularities cease! These daughters becoming mothers,  would educate their children as they themselves had been educated.    Parents should also avoid showing the smallest partiality in the  treatment of their children. It begets a secret jealousy and hatred  among them, which frequently augments with time, and even continues  until death. How often do we see some children the idols of the house,  behaving like absolute tyrants, treating their brothers and sisters as  so many slaves according to the example of father and mother. And it  happens many times, that the favorite proves a scourge to the parents  while the poor despised and hated one becomes their consolation and  support.    My mother was very defective in the education of her children. She  suffered me whole days from her presence in company with the servants,  whose conversation and example were particularly hurtful to one of my  disposition. My mother's heart seemed wholly centered in my brother. I  was scarcely ever favored with the smallest instance of her tenderness  or affection. I therefore voluntarily absented myself from her. It is  true, my brother was more amiable than I but the excess of her fondness  for him, made her blind even to my outward good qualities. It served  only to discover my faults, which would have been trifling had proper  care been taken of me.          CHAPTER 3      My father who loved me tenderly and seeing how little my education was  attended to sent me to a convent of the Ursulines. I was near seven  years old. In this house were two half sisters of mine, the one by my  father, the other by my mother. My father placed me under his  daughter's care, a person of the great capacity and most exalted piety,  excellently qualified for the instruction of youth. This was a singular  dispensation of God's providence and love toward me, and proved the  first means of my salvation. She loved me tenderly, and her affection  made her discover in me many amiable qualities, which the Lord had  implanted in me. She endeavored to improve these good qualities, and I  believe that had I continued in such careful hands, I should have  acquired as many virtuous habits as I afterward contracted evil ones.    This good sister employed her time in instructing me in piety and in  such branches of learning as were suitable to my age and capacity. She  had good talents and improved them well. She was frequent in prayer and  her faith was as great as that of most persons. She denied herself  every other pleasure to be with me and to instruct me. Such was her  affection for me that it made her find more pleasure with me than  anywhere else.    If I made her agreeable answers, though more from chance than from  judgment, she thought herself well paid for all her labor. Under her  care I soon became mistress of most studies suitable for me. Many grown  persons of rank could not have answered the questions.    As my father often sent for me, desiring to see me at home, I found at  one time the Queen of England there. I was near eight years of age. My  father told the Queen's confessor that if he wanted a little amusement  he might entertain himself with me. He tried me with several very  difficult questions, to which I returned such pertinent answers that he  carried me to the Queen, and said, \"Your majesty must have some  diversion with this child.\" She also tried me and was so well pleased  with my lively answers, and my manners, that she demanded me of my  father with no small importunity. She assured him that she would take  particular care of me, designing me for maid of honor to the princess.  My father resisted. Doubtless it was God who caused this refusal, and  thereby turned off the stroke which might have probably intercepted my  salvation. Being so weak, how could I have withstood the temptations  and distractions of a court?    I went back to the Ursulines where my good sister continued her  affection. But as she was not the mistress of the boarders, and I was  obliged sometimes to go along with them, I contracted bad habits. I  became addicted to lying, peevishness and indevotion, passing whole  days without thinking on God; though He watched continually over me, as  the sequel will manifest. I did not remain long under the power of such  habits because my sister's care recovered me. I loved much to hear of  God, was not weary of church, loved to pray, had tenderness for the  poor, and a natural dislike for persons whose doctrine was judged  unsound. God has always continued to me this grace, in my greatest  infidelities.    There was at the end of the garden connected with this convent, a  little chapel dedicated to the child Jesus. To this I betook myself for  devotion and, for some time, carrying my breakfast thither every  morning, I hid it all behind this image. I was so much a child, that I  thought I made a considerable sacrifice in depriving myself of it.  Delicate in my choice of food, I wished to mortify myself, but found  self-love still too prevalent, to submit to such mortification. When  they were cleaning out this chapel, they found behind the image what I  had left there and presently guessed that it was I. They had seen me  every day going thither. I believe that God, who lets nothing pass  without a recompense, soon rewarded me with interest for this little  infantine devotion.    I continued some time with my sister, where I retained the love and  fear of God. My life was easy; I was educated agreeably with her. I  improved much while I had my health, but very often I was sick, and  seized with maladies as sudden as they were uncommon. In the evening  well; in the morning swelled and full of bluish marks, symptoms of a  fever which soon followed. At nine years, I was taken with so violent a  hemorrhage that they thought I was going to die. I was rendered  exceedingly weak.    A little before this severe attack, my other sister became jealous,  wanting to have me in turn. Though she led a good life, yet she had not  a talent for the education of children. At first she caressed me, but  all her caresses made no impression upon my heart. My other sister did  more with a look, than she with either caresses or threatenings. As she  saw that I loved her not so well, she changed to rigorous treatment.  She would not allow me to speak to my other sister. When she knew I had  spoken to her, she had me whipped, or beat me herself. I could no  longer hold out against severe usage, and therefore requited with  apparent ingratitude all the favors of my paternal sister, going no  more to see her. But this did not hinder her from giving me marks of  her usual goodness, in the severe malady just mentioned. She kindly  construed my ingratitude to be rather owing to my fear of chastisement,  than to a bad heart. Indeed, I believe this was the only instance in  which fear of chastisement operated so powerfully upon me. From that  time I suffered more in occasioning pain to One I loved, than in  suffering myself at their hand.    Thou knowest, O my Beloved, that it was not the dread of Thy  chastisements that sunk so deep, either into my understanding or my  heart; it was the sorrow for offending Thee which ever constituted the  whole of my distress; which was so great. I imagine if there were  neither Heaven nor Hell, I should always have retained the same fear of  displeasing Thee."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22282"],[0,"Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit (#3)"],[1,"better dan any un um,  kaze all he hatter do wuz go ter sleep an' live off'n his own fat; an'  Brer Rabbit an' his ol' 'oman had put some calamus root by, an' saved up  some sugar-cane dat dey fin' lyin' 'roun' loose, an' _dey_ got 'long  purty well.
