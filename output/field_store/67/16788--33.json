Especially at the beginning of such a war, when the first necessity is  to get a peaceful nation under arms as quickly as possible, a few  soldier-citizens are invaluable. They form the nucleus of the rising  army, and set the standard for military organization and discipline. In  fact, the French and Indian War would have repaid the colonies all it  cost even if its only result had been to give the youthful Washington  that schooling in arms which helped fit him to command the Continental  armies. Without the Washington of Fort Necessity and of Braddock's  defeat, we could in all likelihood never have had the Washington of  Trenton and Yorktown. Besides Washington, to say nothing of Gates, Gage,  and Mercer, also there, Dan Morgan, of Virginia, began to learn war in  the Braddock campaign.      [Illustration: Tree lined Pond covered with leaves.]  Bloody Pond, near Lake George, which is said to still contain the  bones of many of those who fell in the fight at Fort William Henry.      Again, the war prepared the colonists for the Revolution by revealing to  them their own rare fighting quality, and by showing that the dreaded  British regulars were not invincible. No foe would, at Saratoga or  Monmouth, see the backs of the men who had covered the redcoats' retreat  from the field of Braddock's death, scaled the abatis of Louisburg, or  brained Dieskau's regulars on the parapet of Fort William Henry.    But there was one thing even more necessary to the Revolutionists than  skill at arms, and that was union. Their only hope of successful  resistance against the might of England lay in concerted action, and  perhaps the most important result of the long war through which they had  been passing was the sense of union and of a common cause with which it  had inspired the thirteen colonies. This feeling was of course still  none too intense. But during the long war the colonies had drawn nearer  to one another than ever before. Soldiers from New Hampshire and North  Carolina, from Virginia and Massachusetts, bivouacked together, and  fought shoulder to shoulder. Colonial officers forgot local jealousies  in a common resentment of the contempt and neglect shown them all alike  by the haughty subalterns of the king. Mutual good-will was fostered by  the money and troops which the southern and less exposed colonies sent  to their sister commonwealths on the frontier. In these and numberless  minor ways a community of sentiment was engendered which, imperfect as  it was, yet prepared the way for that hearty co-operation which was to  carry the infant States through the fiery trial just before them.    It is important to remember, as well, not only that the war built up  this conviction of a common interest, but that nothing except the war  could have done it. The great forces of nineteenth-century  civilization--the locomotive, the telegraph, the modern daily  newspaper--which now bind sixty millions of people, spread over half a  continent, into one nation, were then unknown. The means of  communication and transportation between the colonies were very  primitive. Roads were rough, full of steeps and cuts, and in many  places, especially near cities, almost impassable with mire. It took  seven days to go by stage from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, four days  from Boston to New York. The mail service was correspondingly inadequate  and slow. At times in winter a letter would be five weeks in going from  Philadelphia to Virginia. The newspapers were few, contained little  news, and the circulation of each was necessarily confined to a very  limited area. It has been estimated that the reading-matter in all the  forty-three papers which existed at the close of the Revolution would  not fill ten pages of the New York Herald now. In connection with this  state of things consider the fact that the idea of colonial solidarity  had not then, as now, merely to be sustained. It had to be created  outright. Local pride and jealousy were still strong. Each colony had  thought of itself as a complete and isolated political body, in a way  which it is difficult for us, after a hundred years of national unity,  to conceive. Plainly a lifetime of peace would not have begotten the  same degree of consolidation among the colonies which the war, with its  common danger and common purpose, called into being in a half-dozen  years.    The war did yet another important service by removing a dangerous  neighbor of the colonies. So long as France, ambitious and warlike, kept  foot-hold in the New World, the colonies had to look to the  mother-country for protection. But this danger gone, England ceased to  be necessary to the safety of the embryo political communities, and her  sovereignty was therefore the more readily renounced. English statesmen  foresaw this danger before the Peace of Paris, and but for the  magnanimity of Pitt our western territory might after all have been left  in the hands of France.    And the cession of Canada, besides removing an enemy, helped to  transform that enemy into an active friend. Had France retained her  possessions in America, she would still have had an interest in  maintaining the colonial system, and it is doubtful if even her hatred  of England would have induced her to aid the rebellious colonies. But,  her dream of a great Western empire forever dispelled, she had much to  gain and nothing to lose by drawing sword for the American cause. The  British defeated the French at Quebec only to meet them again at  Yorktown.    One more result remains to be noted, without which what has preceded  would lose half its significance. By the Peace of Paris England  succeeded to all of France's possessions in America east of the  Mississippi; but the most valuable part of this great territory she won  only to hold in trust a few years for her colonial children. The  redcoats under Amherst and Wolfe, who thought they were fighting for  King George, were in reality winning an empire for the Young Republic.  It is not easy to feel the full significance of this. The colonies  might, indeed, have won independence even if France had retained her  grasp on the valley of the Mississippi; but so long as the new-born  nation was shut up to a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, it would  have been a lion caged. The \"conquest of Canada,\" says Green, \"by ...  flinging open to their energies in the days to come the boundless plains  of the West, laid the foundation of the United States.\"        CHAPTER II.    GEORGE III. AND HIS AMERICAN COLONIES    [1760]    The year after the capture of Quebec a young king ascended the throne of  England, whose action was to affect profoundly the fortunes of the  American colonies. Of narrow mental range and plebeian tastes, but  moral, sincere, and stout-hearted, George III. assumed the crown with  one dominant purpose--to rule personally; and the first decade of his  reign was a constant struggle to free himself from the dictation of  cabinet ministers. In 1770, during the premiership of North, who was  little more than his page, the king gained the day; and for the next  dozen years he had his own way perfectly. All points of policy, foreign  and domestic, even the management of debates in Parliament, he was  crafty enough to get into his hands. To this meddling of his with state  affairs, his impracticable and fickle plans, and the stupidity of the  admirers whom his policy forced upon him, may be traced in very large  measure the breach between England and the colonies.    The Revolution, however, cannot be wholly accounted for by any series of  events which can be set down and labelled. The ultimate causes lie  deeper. Three thousand miles of ocean rolled between England and the  colonies. A considerable measure of colonial self-government was  inevitable from the first, and this, by fostering the spirit of  independence, created a demand for more and more freedom. The social  ties which had bound the early Pilgrims to their native land grew  steadily weaker with each new generation of people who knew no home but  America. The colonists had begun to feel the stirrings of an independent  national life. The boundless possibilities of the future on this new  continent, with its immense territory and untold natural wealth, were  beginning to dawn upon them. Their infancy was over. The leading-strings  which bound them to the mother-country must be either lengthened or cast  off altogether.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  King George III.      But England did not see this. Most Englishmen at the beginning of George  III.'s reign regarded the colonies as trading corporations rather than  as political bodies. It was taken for granted that a colony was inferior  to the mother-country, and was to be managed in the interests of the  commercial classes at home. Conflict was therefore inevitable sooner or  later. We have to trace briefly the chief events by which it was  precipitated.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  James Otis, Jr.      [1764]    In 1760-61 England tried to enforce the navigation laws more strictly.  Writs of assistance issued, empowering officers to enter any house at  any time, to search for smuggled goods. This measure aroused a storm of  indignation. The popular feeling was voiced, and at the same time  intensified, by the action of James Otis, Jr., a young Boston lawyer,  who threw up his position as advocate-general rather than defend the  hated writs, which he denounced as \"instruments of slavery.\" \"Then and  there,\" said John Adams, \"the trumpet of the Revolution was sounded.\"    In May, 1764, a report reached"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#3)"],[1,"of an octave in the average boy's voice, the longer  bands producing lower tones. The change in size in the female larynx is  in the proportion of five to seven, and the increase is in height  instead of depth or width as in the male larynx. The vocal cords of  women are, therefore, shorter, thinner and narrower than are those of  men.    The reason assigned for the peculiar antics of the boy's voice, during  the break, is unequal rapidity in the growth and development of the  cartilages and of the muscles of the larynx. The muscles develop more  slowly than do the cartilages, and so abnormal physical conditions  produce abnormal results in phonation.    No further changes occur in the laryngeal structure until middle life,  when ossification of the cartilages commences. The thyroid is first  affected, then the cricoid, and the arytenoids much later.    The consequent rigidity of the larynx occasions diminished compass of  the singing-voice, the notes of the upper register being the first to  disappear. In some few cases of arrested development, the voice of the  man retains the soprano compass of the boy through life.          CHAPTER II.    REGISTERS OF THE VOICE.      It may be observed, in listening to an ascending series of tones sung by  an untrained or by a badly-trained adult voice, that at certain pitches  the tone-quality undergoes a radical change; while a well-trained singer  will sing the same series of tones without showing any appreciable break  or change in tone-quality, although the highest note will present a  marked contrast in timbre to the lowest. The breaks or changes in  register so noticeable in the untrained voice are covered or equalized  in the voice trained by correct methods. These breaks in both male and  female voices occur at certain pitches where the tone-producing  mechanism of the larynx changes action, and brings the vocal bands into  a new vibratory form. \"A register consists of a series of tones produced  by the same mechanism.\"-- Emil Behnke in \"Voice, Song, and Speech.\"  G. Edward Stubbs, in commenting upon the above definition, says:    \"By mechanism is meant the action of the larynx which produces  _different sets of vibrations_, and by register is meant the range of  voice confined to a given set of vibrations. In passing the voice from  one register to another, the larynx changes its mechanism and calls into  play a different form of vibration.\"    The number of vocal registers, or vibratory forms, which the vocal bands  assume, is still a matter of dispute, and their nomenclature is equally  unsettled. The old Italian singing-masters gave names to parts of the  vocal compass corresponding to the real or imaginary bodily sensations  experienced in singing them; as chest-voice, throat-voice, head-voice.  Madame Seiler, in \"The Voice in Singing,\" gives as the result of  original investigations with the laryngoscope five different actions of  the vocal bands which she classifies as \"first and second series of the  chest-register,\" \"first and second series of the falsetto register\" and  \"head-register.\" Browne and Behnke, in \"Voice, Song, and Speech,\" divide  the male voice into three registers, and the female into five. They are  termed \"lower thick,\" \"upper thick,\" \"lower thin,\" \"upper thin\" and  \"small.\" Other writers speak of three registers, \"chest,\" \"medium\" and  \"head,\" and still others of two only, viz., the chest and the head.    Modern research has shown what was after all understood before, that, if  the vibratory form assumed by the vocal bands for the natural production  of a certain set of tones is pushed by muscular exertion above the point  where it should cease, inflammation and weakening of the vocal organs  will result, while voice-deterioration is sure to follow.  A physiological basis has reinforced the empirical deductions of the old  Italian school. In dealing with children's voices, it is necessary to  recognize only two registers, the thick, or chest-register, and the  thin, or head-register. Further subdivisions will only complicate the  subject without assisting in the practical management of their voices.  Tones sung in the thick or chest-register are produced by the full, free  vibration of the vocal bands in their entire length, breadth and  thickness. The tones of the thin or head-register result from the  vibration of the vocal bands along their inner edges alone.    We may then conclude from the foregoing that _children up to the age of  puberty, at least in class or chorus singing, should use the thin or  head-register only_.    1st. It is from a physiological standpoint entirely safe. The use of  this register will not strain or overwork the delicate vocal organs of  childhood.    2d. Its tones are musical, pure and sweet, and their use promotes the  growth of musical sensibility and an appreciation of beauty in tone.    3d. The use of the thick or chest-voice in class-singing is dangerous.  It is wellnigh impossible to confine it within proper limits.    It is unnecessary to discuss the second point. Anyone who has noted the  contrast between the harsh quality of tone emitted from childish throats  when using the chest-voice, and the pure, flute-like sound produced when  the head-tones are sung will agree that the last is music and the first  noise, or at any rate very noisy, barbaric music.    The third point, if true, establishes the first, for, if the chest-voice  cannot be safely used, it follows that children must use the  head-register or stop singing. It must be said, before proceeding  further, that it is not denied that the thick voice can be used by  children without injury, if properly managed; that is, if the singing be  not too loud, and if it be not carried too high. It is also fully  recognized, that, when theoretically the head-voice alone is used, it  yet, when carried to the lower tones, insensibly blends into the thick  register; but if this equalization of registers is obtained so  completely that no perceptible difference in quality of voice can be  observed, why then the whole compass is practically the thin or  head-register.    Now, can the thick voice be used in school-singing, and confined to the  lower notes? And is it fairly easy to secure soft and pure vocalizations  in this register? Let the experience of thousands of teachers in the  public schools of this and other lands answer the last question.    It would be as easy to stop the growth of the average boy with a word,  or to persuade a crowd of youngsters to speak softly at a game of  baseball, as to induce them, or girls either for that matter, to use the  voice gently, when singing with that register in which it is possible to  push the tone and shout.    There should be some good physiological reason for the habitual recourse  to the strident chest-voice so common with boys, and nearly as usual  with girls. And there is a good reason. It is _lack of rigidity in the  voice-box or larynx_. Its cartilages harden slowly, and even just before  the age of puberty the larynx falls far short of the firmness and  rigidity of structure, that characterize the organ in adult life. It is  physically very difficult for the adult to force the chest-voice beyond  its natural limits, which become fixed when full maturity of bodily  development is reached, but the child, whose laryngeal cartilages are  far more flexible, and move toward and upon each other with greater  freedom, can force the chest-voice up with great ease. The altitude of  pitch which is attained before breaking into the thin register is with  young children regulated by the amount of muscular exertion they put  forth. Even up to the change of voice, boys can often force the thick  register several notes higher than women sopranos.    It must be borne in mind that the thick voice is produced by the full,  free vibrations of the vocal bands in their entire length, breadth and  thickness.    Imagine children six years of age carrying tones formed in this manner  to the extreme limit of their voice; yet they do it. The tone of infant  classes in Sunday-schools, and the tone of the primary schools, as they  sing their morning hymns or songs for recreation, is produced in nine  hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand in exactly the way set  forth. If the vocal bands of children were less elastic, if they were  composed of stronger fibres, and protected from undue exertion by firm  connecting cartilage; in short, if children were not children, such  forcing would not be possible. If it were not for the wonderful  recuperative power of childhood, serious effects would follow such vocal  habits.    We are now prepared to understand that common phenomenon of the  child-voice, termed the \"movable break.\" Every public school teacher who  has had experience in teaching singing must be familiar with the meaning  of the term, though possibly unaware of it. Allusion has already been  made to the fact that, in primary grades, the thick quality, if  permitted, will be carried as high as the children sing, to        [Music: e'']    for example. If they are required to sing the higher tones lightly, then  the three or four tones, just below the pitch indicated, will be sung in  a thin quality of voice. The place of the break or the absence of any  break at all will depend upon the degree of loudness permitted.    Pass now to a grade in which the pupils average eleven years of age.  These can use the thick tones as high as        [Music: d'' e'']    only with great exertion, and, if required to sing softly, will pass  into the thin register at a lower pitch than the primary class. Now, go  to a room where the children range in age from thirteen to fifteen  years. The girls will still use thick tones up to        [Music: b' c'' d'']    The pitch at which the break occurs will vary in individual cases  according to physique or ambition to sing well; but the boys (excluding  those whose voices have begun to"]]]
