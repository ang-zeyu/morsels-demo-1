But  the Agharia fled south, taking his whole village with him, and came  to Chhattisgarh, where each of the families in the village founded a  clan of the Agharia caste. And in memory of this, whenever an Agharia  makes a libation to his ancestors, he first pours a little water on  the ground in honour of the dead Chamar. According to another version  of the story three brothers of different families escaped and first  went to Orissa, where they asked the Gajpati king to employ them  as soldiers. The king caused two sheaths of swords to be placed  before them, and telling them that one contained a sword and the  other a bullock-goad, asked them to select one and by their choice  to determine whether they would be soldiers or husbandmen. From one  sheath a haft of gold projected and from the other one of silver. The  Agharias pulled out the golden haft and found that they had chosen the  goad. The point of the golden and silver handles is obvious, and the  story is of some interest for the distant resemblance which it bears  to the choice of the caskets in _The Merchant of Venice_. Condemned,  as they considered, to drive the plough, the Agharias took off their  sacred threads, which they could no longer wear, and gave them to  the youngest member of the caste, saying that he should keep them  and be their Bhat, and they would support him with contributions  of a tenth of the produce of their fields. He assented, and his  descendants are the genealogists of the Agharias and are termed  Dashanshi. The Agharias claim to be Somvansi Rajputs, a claim which  Colonel Dalton says their appearance favours. \"Tall, well-made, with  high Aryan features and tawny complexions, they look like Rajputs,  though they are more industrious and intelligent than the generality  of the fighting tribe.\" [6]        2. Subdivisions.      Owing to the fact that with the transfer of the Sambalpur District,  a considerable portion of the Agharias have ceased to be residents  of the Central Provinces, it is unnecessary to give the details  of their caste organisation at length. They have two subdivisions,  the Bad or superior Agharias and the Chhote, Sarolia or Sarwaria,  the inferior or mixed Agharias. The latter are a cross between an  Agharia and a Gaur (Ahir) woman. The Bad Agharias will not eat with or  even take water from the others. Further local subdivisions are now  in course of formation, as the Ratanpuria, Phuljharia and Raigarhia  or those living round Ratanpur, Phuljhar and Raigarh. The caste is  said to have 84 _gotras_ or exogamous sections, of which 60 bear  the title of Patel, 18 that of Naik, and 6 of Chaudhri. The section  names are very mixed, some being those of eponymous Brahman _gotras_,  as Sandilya, Kaushik and Bharadwaj; others those of Rajput septs, as  Karchhul; while others are the names of animals and plants, as Barah  (pig), Baram (the pipal tree), Nag (cobra), Kachhapa (tortoise),  and a number of other local terms the meaning of which has been  forgotten. Each of these sections, however, uses a different mark  for branding cows, which it is the religious duty of an Agharia to  rear, and though the marks now convey no meaning, they were probably  originally the representations of material objects. In the case of  names whose meaning is understood, traces of totemism survive in the  respect paid to the animal or plant by members of the sept which bears  its name. This analysis of the structure of the caste shows that it  was a very mixed one. Originally consisting perhaps of a nucleus  of immigrant Rajputs, the offspring of connections with inferior  classes have been assimilated; while the story already quoted is  probably intended to signify, after the usual Brahmanical fashion,  that the pedigree of the Agharias at some period included a Chamar.        3. Marriage customs.      Marriage within the exogamous section and also with first cousins is  forbidden, though in some places the union of a sister's son with  a brother's daughter is permitted. Child marriage is usual, and  censure visits a man who allows an unmarried daughter to arrive at  adolescence. The bridegroom should always be older than the bride,  at any rate by a day. When a betrothal is arranged some ornaments  and a cloth bearing the _swastik_ or lucky mark are sent to the  girl. Marriages are always celebrated during the months of Magh  and Phagun, and they are held only once in five or six years,  when all children whose matches can be arranged for are married  off. This custom is economical, as it saves expenditure on marriage  feasts. Colonel Dalton also states that the Agharias always employ  Hindustani Brahmans for their ceremonies, and as very few of these  are available, they make circuits over large areas, and conduct all  the weddings of a locality at the same period. Before the marriage a  kid is sacrificed at the bride's house to celebrate the removal of her  status of maidenhood. When the bridegroom arrives at the bride's house  he touches with his dagger the string of mango-leaves suspended from  the marriage-shed and presents a rupee and a hundred betel-leaves  to the bride's _sawasin_ or attendant. Next day the bridegroom's  father sends a present of a bracelet and seven small earthen cups to  the bride. She is seated in the open, and seven women hold the cups  over her head one above the other. Water is then poured from above  from one cup into the other, each being filled in turn and the whole  finally falling on the bride's head. This probably symbolises the  fertilising action of rain. The bride is then bathed and carried  in a basket seven times round the marriage-post, after which she  is seated in a chair and seven women place their heads together  round her while a male relative winds a thread seven times round  the heads of the women. The meaning of this ceremony is obscure. The  bridegroom makes his appearance alone and is seated with the bride,  both being dressed in clothes coloured yellow with turmeric. The  bridegroom's party follows, and the feet of the couple are washed  with milk. The bride's brother embraces the bridegroom and changes  cloths with him. Water is poured over the hands of the couple,  the girl's forehead is daubed with vermilion, and a red silk cloth  is presented to her and the couple go round the marriage-post. The  bride is taken for four days to the husband's house and then returns,  and is again sent with the usual _gauna_ ceremony, when she is fit  for conjugal relations. No price is usually paid for the bride, and  each party spends about Rs. 100 on the marriage ceremony. Polygamy  and widow marriage are generally allowed, the widow being disposed  of by her parents. The ceremony at the marriage of a widow consists  in putting vermilion on the parting of her hair and bangles on her  wrists. Divorce is allowed on pain of a fine of Rs. 50 if the divorce  is sought by the husband, and of Rs. 25 if the wife asks for it. In  some localities divorce and also polygamy are said to be forbidden,  and in such cases a woman who commits adultery is finally expelled  from the caste, and a funeral feast is given to symbolise her death.        4. Religious and social customs.      The family god of the Agharias is Dulha Deo, who exists in every  household. On the Haraiti day or the commencement of the agricultural  year they worship the implements of cultivation, and at Dasahra  the sword if they have one. They have a great reverence for cows  and feed them sumptuously at festivals. Every Agharia has a _guru_  or spiritual guide who whispers the _mantra_ or sacred verse into  his ear and is occasionally consulted. The dead are usually burnt,  but children and persons dying of cholera or smallpox are buried,  males being placed on the pyre or in the grave on their faces and  females on their backs, with the feet pointing to the south. On  the third day the ashes are thrown into a river and the bones of  each part of the body are collected and placed under the pipal  tree, while a pot is slung over them, through which water trickles  continually for a week, and a lighted lamp, cooked food, a leaf-cup  and a tooth-stick are placed beside them daily for the use of the  deceased during the same period. Mourning ends on the tenth day,  and the usual purification ceremonies are then performed. Children  are mourned for a shorter period. Well-to-do members of the caste  feed a Brahman daily for a year after a death, believing that food  so given passes to the spirit of the deceased. On the anniversary of  the death the caste-fellows are feasted, and after that the deceased  becomes a _purkha_ or ancestor and participates in devotions paid  at the _shradhh_ ceremony. When the head of a joint family dies,  his successor is given a turban and betel-leaves, and his forehead  is marked by the priest and other relations with sandalwood. After a  birth the mother is impure for twenty-one days. A feast is given on  the twelfth day, and sometimes the child is named then, but often  children are not named until they are six years old. The names of  men usually end in _Ram_, _Nath_ or _Singh_, and those of women in  _Kunwar_. Women do not name their husbands, their elderly relations,  nor the sons of their husband's eldest brother. A man does not name  his wife, as he thinks that to do so would tend to shorten his life  in accordance with the Sanskrit saying, 'He who is desirous of long  life should not name himself, his _guru_, a miser, his eldest son,  or his wife.' The Agharias do not admit outsiders into the caste. They  will not take cooked food from any caste, and water only from a Gaur  or Rawat. They refuse to take water from an Uriya Brahman, probably  in retaliation for the refusal of Uriya Brahmans to accept water from  an Agharia, though taking it from a Kolta. Both the Uriya Brahmans  and Agharias are of somewhat doubtful origin,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22014"],[0,"The Peter Patter Book of Nursery Rhymes (#3)"],[1,"babies to rest.
