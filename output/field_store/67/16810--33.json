Since, owing to an almost incredible act of royal vindictiveness in A.D.  1538, Becket's glorious shrine belongs only to the history of the past,  some account of its splendours will not be out of place in this part of  our account of the cathedral. It stood on the site of the ancient chapel  of the Trinity, which was burnt down along with Conrad's choir in the  destructive fire of A.D. 1174. It was in this chapel that Thomas a Becket  had first solemnized mass after becoming archbishop. For this reason, as  we may fairly suppose, this position was chosen to enshrine the martyr's  bones, after the rebuilding of the injured portion of the fabric. Though  the shrine itself has been ruthlessly destroyed, a mosaic pavement,  similar to that which may be seen round the tomb of Edward the Confessor  in Westminster Abbey, marks the exact spot on which it stood. The mosaic  is of the kind with which the floors of the Roman basilicas were generally  adorned, and contains signs of the zodiacs and emblems of virtues and  vices. This pavement was directly in front of the west side of the shrine.  On each side of the site is a deep mark in the pavement running towards  the east. This indentation was certainly worn in the soft, pinkish marble  by the knees of generations of pilgrims, who prostrated themselves here  while the treasures were displayed to their gaze. In the roof above there  is fixed a crescent carved out of some foreign wood, which has proved  deeply puzzling to antiquaries. A suggestion, which hardly seems very  plausible, connects this mysterious crescent with the fact that Becket was  closely related, as patron, with the Hospital of St. John at Acre. It was  believed that his prayers had once repulsed the Saracens from the walls of  the fortress, and he received the title of St. Thomas Acrensis. Near this  crescent a number of iron staples were to be seen at one time, and it is  likely that a trophy of some sort depended from them. The Watching Tower  was set high upon the Tower of St. Anselm, on the south side of the  shrine. It contained a fireplace, so that the watchman might keep himself  warm during the winter nights, and from a gallery between the pillars he  commanded a view of the sacred spot and its treasures. A troop of fierce  ban-dogs shared the task of guarding the shrine from theft. How necessary  such precautions were is shown by the fact that such a spot had to be  guarded not only from common robbers in search of rich booty, but also  from holy men, who were quite unscrupulous in their desire to possess  themselves and their own churches of sacred relics. Within the first six  years after Becket's death we read of two striking instances of the  lengths to which distinguished churchmen were carried by what Dean Stanley  calls \"the first frenzy of desire for the relics of St. Thomas.\" Benedict,  a monk of Christ Church, and \"probably the most distinguished of his  body,\" was created Abbot of Peterburgh in A.D. 1176. Disappointed to find  that his cathedral was very poor in the matter of relics he returned to  Canterbury, \"took away with him the flagstones immediately surrounding the  sacred spot, with which he formed two altars in the conventual church of  his new appointment, besides two vases of blood and parts of Becket's  clothing.\" Still more striking and characteristic of the prevalent passion  for relics is the story of Roger, who was keeper of the \"Altars of the  Martyrdom,\" or \"Custos Martyrii.\" The brothers of St. Augustine's Abbey  were so eager to obtain a share in the glory which their great rival, the  neighbouring cathedral, had won from the circumstances of Becket's  martyrdom within its walls, that they actually offered Roger no less a  reward than the position of abbot in their own institution, on condition  that he should purloin for them some part of the remains of the martyr's  skull. And not only did Roger, though he had been specially selected from  amongst the monks of Christ Church to watch over this very treasure, agree  to their conditions, and after duly carrying out this piece of  sacrilegious burglary become Abbot of St. Augustine's; but the chroniclers  of the abbey were not ashamed to boast of this transaction as an instance  of cleverness and well-applied zeal.    The translation of Becket's remains from the tomb to his shrine took place  A.D. 1220, fifty years after his martyrdom. The young Henry III., who had  just laid the foundation of the new abbey at Westminster, assisted at the  ceremony. The primate then ruling at Canterbury was the great Stephen  Langton, who had won renown both as a scholar and a statesman. He had  carried out the division of the Bible into chapters, as it is now  arranged, and had won a decisive victory for English liberty by forcing  King John to sign the Great Charter. He was now advanced in years, and had  recently assisted at the coronation of King Henry at Westminster.    The translation was carried out with imposing ceremony. The scene must  have been one of surpassing splendour; never had such an assemblage been  gathered together in England. Robert of Gloucester relates that not only  Canterbury but the surrounding countryside was full to overflowing:        \"Of bishops and abbots, priors and parsons,      Of earls, and of barons, and of many knights thereto;      Of serjeants, and of squires, and of husbandmen enow,      And of simple men eke of the land--so thick thither drew.\"    The archbishop had given notice two years before, proclaiming the day of  the solemnity throughout Europe as well as England: the episcopal manors  had been bidden to furnish provisions for the huge concourse, not only in  the cathedral city, but along all the roads by which it was approached.  Hay and provisions were given to all who asked it between London and  Canterbury; at the gates of the city and in the four licensed cellars tuns  of wine were set up, that all who thirsted might drink freely, and wine  ran in the street channels on the day of the festival. During the night  before the ceremony the primate, together with the Bishop of Salisbury and  all the members of the brotherhood, who were headed by Walter the Prior,  solemnly, with psalms and hymns, entered the crypt in which the martyr's  body lay, and removed the stones which covered the tomb. Four priests,  specially conspicuous for their piety, were selected to take out the  relics, which were then placed in a strong coffer studded with iron nails  and fastened with iron hasps.    Next day a procession was formed, headed by the young king, Henry III.  After him came Pandulf, the Italian Bishop of Norwich and Papal Nuncio,  and Langton the archbishop, with whom was the Archbishop of Rheims,  Primate of France. The great Hubert de Burgh, Lord High Justiciary,  together with four other barons, completed the company, which was selected  to bear the chest to its resting-place. When this had been duly deposited,  a solemn mass was celebrated by the French archbishop. The anniversary of  this great festival was commemorated as the Feast of the Translation of  the Blessed St. Thomas, until it was suppressed by a royal injunction of  Henry VIII. in 1536.    A picture of the shrine itself is preserved among the Cottonian MSS., and  a representation of it also exists in one of the stained windows of the  cathedral. At the end of it the altar of the Saint had its place; the  lower part of its walls were of stone, and against them the lame and  diseased pilgrims used to rub their bodies, hoping to be cured of their  afflictions. The shrine itself was supported on marble arches, and  remained concealed under a wooden covering, doubtless intended to enhance  the effect produced by the sudden revelation of the glories beneath it;  for when the pilgrims were duly assembled on their knees round the shrine,  the cover was suddenly raised at a given signal, and though such a device  may appear slightly theatrical in these days, it is easy to imagine how  the devotees of the middle ages must have been thrilled at the sight of  this hallowed tomb, and all the bravery of gold and precious stones which  the piety of that day had heaped upon it. The beauties of the shrine were  pointed out by the prior, who named the giver of the several jewels. Many  of these were of enormous value, especially a huge carbuncle, as large as  an egg, which had been offered to the memory of St. Thomas by Louis VII.  of France, who visited the shrine in A.D. 1179, after having thrice seen  the Saint in a vision. A curious legend, thoroughly in keeping with the  mystic halo of miraculous power which surrounds the martyred archbishop's  fame, relates that the French king could not make up his mind to part with  this invaluable gem, which was called the \"Regale of France;\" but when he  visited the tomb, the stone, so runs the story, leapt forth from the ring  in which it was set, and fixed itself of its own will firmly in the wall  of the shrine, thus baffling the unwilling monarch's half-heartedness.  Louis also presented a gold cup, and gave the monks a hundred measures,  medii, of wine, to be delivered annually at Poissy, also ordaining that  they should be exempt from \"toll, tax, and tallage\" when journeying in his  realm. He himself was made a member of the brotherhood, after duly  spending a night in prayer at the tomb. It is said that, \"because he was  very fearful of the water,\" the French king received a promise from the  Saint that neither he nor any other that crossed over from Dover to  Whitsand, should suffer any manner of loss or shipwreck. We are told that  Louis's piety was afterwards rewarded by the miraculous recovery, through  St. Thomas's intercession, of his son from a dangerous illness. Louis was  the first of a series of royal pilgrims to the shrine.

She had just returned with that  perfect peace which comes only of a full stomach, when she saw a little  brown creature in her junk-yard. Hunting memories came back in  strength; she didn't know what it was, but she had killed and eaten  several Mice, and this was evidently a big Mouse with bob-tail and  large ears. Kitty stalked it with elaborate but unnecessary caution;  the little Rabbit simply sat up and looked faintly amused. He did not  try to run, and Kitty sprang on him and bore him off. As she was not  hungry, she carried him to the cracker-box and dropped him among the  Kittens. He was not much hurt. He got over his fright, and since he  could not get out of the box, he snuggled among the Kittens, and when  they began to take their evening meal he very soon decided to join  them. The old Cat was puzzled. The hunter instinct had been dominant,  but absence of hunger had saved the Rabbit and given the maternal  instinct a chance to appear. The result was that the Rabbit became a  member of the family, and was thenceforth guarded and fed with the  Kittens.    Two weeks went by. The Kittens romped much among the boxes during their  mother's absence. The Rabbit could not get out of the box. Jap Malee,  seeing the Kittens about the back yard, told the negro to shoot them.  This he was doing one morning with a 22-calibre rifle. He had shot one  after another and seen them drop from sight into the crannies of the  lumber-pile, when the old Cat came running along the wall from the  dock, carrying a small Wharf Rat. He had been ready to shoot her, too,  but the sight of that Rat changed his plans: a rat-catching Cat was  worthy to live. It happened to be the very first one she had ever  caught, but it saved her life. She threaded the lumber-maze to the  cracker-box and was probably puzzled to find that there were no Kittens  to come at her call, and the Rabbit would not partake of the Rat. Pussy  curled up to nurse the Rabbit, but she called from time to time to  summon the Kittens. Guided by that call, the negro crawled quietly to  the place, and peering down into the cracker-box, saw, to his intense  surprise, that it contained the old Cat, a live Rabbit, and a dead Rat.    The mother Cat laid back her ears and snarled. The negro withdrew, but  a minute later a board was dropped on the opening of the cracker-box,  and the den with its tenants, dead and alive, was lifted into the  bird-cellar.    \"Say, boss, look a-hyar--hyar's where de little Rabbit got to wot we  lost. Yo' sho t'ought Ah stoled him for de 'tater-bake.\"    Kitty and Bunny were carefully put in a large wire cage and exhibited  as a happy family till a few days later, when the Rabbit took sick and  died.    Pussy had never been happy in the cage. She had enough to eat and  drink, but she craved her freedom--would likely have gotten 'death or  liberty' now, but that during the four days' captivity she had so  cleaned and slicked her fur that her unusual coloring was seen, and Jap  decided to keep her.        LIFE II    VI    Jap Malee was as disreputable a little Cockney bantam as ever sold  cheap Canary-birds in a cellar. He was extremely poor, and the negro  lived with him because the 'Henglish-man' was willing to share bed and  board, and otherwise admit a perfect equality that few Americans  conceded. Jap was perfectly honest according to his lights, but he  hadn't  any lights; and it was well known that his chief revenue was  derived from storing and restoring stolen Dogs and Cats. The half-dozen  Canaries were mere blinds. Yet Jap believed in himself. \"Hi tell you,  Sammy, me boy, you'll see me with 'orses of my own yet,\" he would say,  when some trifling success inflated his dirty little chest. He was not  without ambition, in a weak, flabby, once-in-a-while way, and he  sometimes wished to be known as a fancier. Indeed, he had once gone the  wild length of offering a Cat for exhibition at the Knickerbocker High  Society Cat and Pet Show, with three not over-clear objects: first, to  gratify his ambition; second, to secure the exhibitor's free pass; and,  third, \"well, you kneow, one 'as to kneow the valuable Cats, you kneow,  when one goes a-catting.\" But this was a society show, the exhibitor  had to be introduced, and his miserable alleged half-Persian was  scornfully rejected. The 'Lost and Found' columns of the papers were  the only ones of interest to Jap, but he had noticed and saved a  clipping about 'breeding for fur.' This was stuck on the wall of his  den, and under its influence he set about what seemed a cruel  experiment with the Slum Cat. First, he soaked her dirty fur with stuff  to kill the two or three kinds of creepers she wore; and, when it had  done its work, he washed her thoroughly in soap and warm water, in  spite of her teeth, claws, and yowls. Kitty was savagely indignant, but  a warm and happy glow spread over her as she dried off in a cage near  the stove, and her fur began to fluff out with wonderful softness and  whiteness. Jap and his assistant were much pleased with the result, and  Kitty ought to have been. But this was preparatory: now for the  experiment. \"Nothing is so good for growing fur as plenty of oily food  and continued exposure to cold weather,\" said the clipping. Winter was  at hand, and Jap Malee put Kitty's cage out in the yard, protected only  from the rain and the direct wind, and fed her with all the oil-cake  and fish-heads she could eat. In a week a change began to show. She was  rapidly getting fat and sleek--she had nothing to do but get fat and  dress her fur. Her cage was kept clean, and nature responded to the  chill weather and the oily food by making Kitty's coat thicker and  glossier every day, so that by midwinter she was an unusually beautiful  Cat in the fullest and finest of fur, with markings that were at least  a rarity. Jap was much pleased with the result of the experiment, and  as a very little success had a wonderful effect on him, he began to  dream of the paths of glory. Why not send the Slum Cat to the show now  coming on? The failure of the year before made him more careful as to  details. \"'T won't do, ye kneow, Sammy, to henter 'er as a tramp Cat,  ye kneow,\" he observed to his help; \"but it kin be arranged to suit the  Knickerbockers. Nothink like a good noime, ye kneow. Ye see now it had  orter be 'Royal' somethink or other--nothink goes with the  Knickerbockers like 'Royal' anythink. Now 'Royal Dick,' or 'Royal Sam,'  'ow's that? But 'owld on; them's Tom names. Oi say, Sammy, wot's the  noime of that island where ye wuz born?\"    \"Analostan Island, sah, was my native vicinity, sah.\"    \"Oi say, now, that's good, ye kneow. 'Royal Analostan,' by Jove! The  onliest pedigreed 'Royal Analostan' in the 'ole sheow, ye kneow. Ain't  that foine?\" and they mingled their cackles.    \"But we'll 'ave to 'ave a pedigree, ye kneow.\" So a very long fake  pedigree on the recognized lines was prepared. One dark afternoon Sam,  in a borrowed silk hat, delivered the Cat and the pedigree at the show  door. The darkey did the honors. He had been a Sixth Avenue barber, and  he could put on more pomp and lofty hauteur in five minutes than Jap  Malee could have displayed in a lifetime, and this, doubtless, was one  reason for the respectful reception awarded the Royal Analostan at the  Cat Show.    Jap was very proud to be an exhibitor; but he had all a Cockney's  reverence for the upper class, and when on the opening day he went to  the door, he was overpowered to see the array of carriages and silk  hats. The gate-man looked at him sharply, but passed him on his ticket,  doubtless taking him for stable-boy to some exhibitor. The hall had  velvet carpets before the long rows of cages. Jap, in his small  cunning, was sneaking down the side rows, glancing at the Cats of all  kinds, noting the blue ribbons and the reds, peering about but not  daring to ask for his own exhibit, inly trembling to think what the  gorgeous gathering of fashion would say if they discovered the trick he  was playing on them. He had passed all around the outer aisles and seen  many prize-winners, but no sign of Slum Kitty. The inner aisles were  more crowded. He picked his way down them, but still no Kitty, and he  decided that it was a mistake; the judges had rejected the Cat later.  Never mind; he had his exhibitor's ticket, and now knew where several  valuable Persians and Angoras were to be found.    In the middle of the centre aisle were the high-class Cats. A great  throng was there. The passage was roped, and two policemen were in  place to keep the crowd moving. Jap wriggled in among them; he was too  short to see over, and though the richly gowned folks shrunk from his  shabby old clothes, he could not get near; but he gathered from the  remarks that the gem of the show was there.    \"Oh, isn't  she a beauty!\" said one tall woman.    \"What distinction!\" was the reply.    \"One cannot mistake the air that comes only from ages of the most  refined surroundings.\"    \"How I should like to own that superb creature!\"    \"Such dignity--such repose!\"    \"She has an authentic pedigree nearly back to the Pharaohs, I hear\";  and poor, dirty little Jap marvelled at his own cheek in sending his  Slum Cat into such company.    \"Excuse me, madame.\" The director of the show now appeared, edging his  way through the crowd. \"The artist of the 'sporting Element' is here,  under orders to sketch the 'pearl of the show' for immediate use. May I  ask you to stand a little aside? That's it; thank you.    \"Oh, Mr. Director, cannot you persuade him to sell that beautiful  creature?\"    \"Hm, I don't know,\" was the reply. \"I understand he is a man of ample  means and not at all approachable; but I'll try, I'll try, madame. He  was quite unwilling to exhibit his treasure at all, so I understand  from his butler. Here, you, keep out of the way,\" growled the director,  as the shabby little man eagerly"]]]
