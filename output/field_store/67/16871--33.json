Until that confidence shall be established, little can be done anywhere  for what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still  be directed to the Army and Navy, who have thus far borne their hardest  part nobly and well. And it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the  greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms, we do also honorably  recognize the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them,  to whom, more than to others, the world must stand indebted for the home  of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and perpetuated.    Abraham Lincoln. December 8, 1863.    The following is the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction referred  to in the foregoing Message, and further illustrates Mr. Lincoln's plan  for the restoration of the Union:    PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION.    BY THE PRESIDENT ON THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.    Whereas, in and by the Constitution of the United States, it is provided  that the President \"shall have the power to grant reprieves and pardons  for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;\"  and    Whereas, a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of  several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons  have committed, and are guilty of treason against the United States; and    Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been  enacted by Congress, declaring forfeitures and confiscations of property  and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated,  and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any  time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have  participated in the existing rebellion, in any State or part thereof,  pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such  conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and    Whereas, the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional  pardon accords with well established judicial exposition of the  pardoning power; and    Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United  States has issued several proclamations, with provisions in regard to  the liberation of slaves; and    Whereas, it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said  rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States, and to  reinaugurate loyal State Governments within and for their respective  States; therefore,    I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim,  declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by  implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as  hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and  each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to  slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have  intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take  and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and maintain said  oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent  preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to-wit:    I, ___ __ ___, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I  will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution  of the United States, and the Union of the States thereunder; and that  I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all acts of  Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves,  so long and so far as not repealed, modified or held void by Congress,  or by the decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will, in like  manner, abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the  President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves,  so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the  Supreme Court. So help me God.    The persons exempted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are  all who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic officers or agents  of the so-called Confederate Government: all who have left judicial  stations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or  shall have been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate  Government above the rank of Colonel in the army or Lieutenant in the  Navy; all who have left seats in the United States Congress to aid  the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the army or navy of  the United States and afterward aided the rebellion; and all who have  engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in  charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which  persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers,  seamen, or in any capacity.    And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in  any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,  Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, a number  of persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such  State at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord one thousand  eight hundred and sixty, each having taken the oath aforesaid and not  having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election  laws of the State existing immediately before the so-called act  of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State  government which shall be republican, and in no wise contravening said  oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and  the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional  provision which declares that \"the United States shall guarantee to  every state in this Union a republican form of government, and shall  protect each of them against invasion; and, on the application of the  legislature, or the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened)  against domestic violence.\"    And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known, that any provision  which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed  people of such State, which shall recognize and declare their permanent  freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent  as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,  landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National  Executive.    And it is suggested as not improper that, in constructing a loyal  State government in any State, the name of the State, the boundary, the  subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws, as before  the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications made  necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if  any, not contravening said conditions, and which may be deemed expedient  by those framing the new State government.    To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say, that whether  members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats,  constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective houses, and  not to any extent with the Executive. And still further, that this  proclamation is intended to present to the people of the States wherein  the National authority has been suspended; and loyal State governments  have been subverted, a mode in and by which the National authority and  loyal State governments, may be re-established within said States, or,  in any of them; and while the mode presented is the best the Executive  can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood  that no other possible mode would be acceptable.    Given under my hand at the City of Washington, the eighth day of  December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and  sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America,  the eighty-eighth.    [L. S.]    By the President: Abraham Lincoln. William H. Seward, Secretary of  State.    How the revolted States could be most successfully and expeditiously  restored to their constitutional relations to the Union on the cessation  of hostilities, was the momentous question of the hour, upon which there  were views and schemes as varied and antagonistic as were the mental  differences and political disagreements of those who felt called upon  to engage in the stupendous work. As history had recorded no similar  conditions, and therefore no demand for the solution of such a problem,  there were no examples or historic lights for the guidance of those upon  whom the task had fallen.    It is apparent that Mr. Lincoln maintained the indestructibility of  the States and the indivisibility of the Union--that the resolutions of  secession were null and void, and that the States lately in rebellion  were never in fact but only in theory out of the Union--that they  retained inherently, though now dormant, their State autonomy and  constitutional rights as before their revolutionary acts, except as  to slavery, and that all their people had to do, to re-establish their  former status, as he declared to the Emperor of the French when that  potentate was about to recognize the Confederacy, was to resume their  duties as loyal, law-abiding citizens, and reorganize their State  Governments on a basis of loyalty to the Constitution and the Union. The  terms he proposed to formally offer them were first illustrated in the  case of Louisiana, early in 1863, and later in the foregoing Message  and Proclamation; and clearly indicated what was to be his policy and  process of reconstruction.    Messrs. Flanders and Hahn were admitted to the House of Representatives  as members from Louisiana agreeably to the President's views thus  outlined. They had been chosen at an election ordered by the Governor  of the State (Gov. Shepley), who had undoubtedly been permitted, if not  specially authorized by the President, to take this step, but they were  the last to be received from Louisiana"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24420"],[0,"The Story of Frithiof the Bold (#3)"],[1,"nd; yet sang a ditty straightway:                \"Sharp work about the sail was            When o'er the ship seas tumbled,            And there was I a-working            Within-board 'gainst eight balers;            Better it was to bower,            Bringing the women breakfast,            Than here to be 'mid billows            Black Ellidi a-baling.\"    \"Thou accountest thy help of no less worth than it is?\" said Frithiof,  laughing therewith; \"but sure it showeth the thrall's blood in thee that  thou wouldst fain be awaiting at table.\"    Now it blew harder and harder yet, so that to those who were aboard  liker to huge peaks and mountains than to waves seemed the sea-breakers  that crashed on all sides against the ship.    Then Frithiof sang:              \"On bolster I sat.            In Baldur's Mead erst,            And all songs that I could            To the king's daughter sang;            Now on Ran's bed belike            Must I soon be a-lying,            And another shall be            By Ingibiorg's side.\"    Biorn said: \"Great fear lieth ahead of us, foster-brother, and now dread  hath crept into thy words, which is ill with such a good man as thou.\"    Says Frithiof: \"Neither fear nor fainting is it, though I sing now of  those our merry journeys; yet perchance more hath been said of them than  need was: but most men would think death surer than life, if they were  so bested as we be.\"    \"Yet shall I answer thee somewhat,\" said Biorn, and sang:              \"Yet one gain have I gotten            Thou gatst not 'mid thy fortune,            For meet play did I make me            With Ingibiorgs eight maidens;            Red rings we laid together            Aright in Baldur's Meadow,            When far off was the warder            Of the wide land of Halfdan.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"we must be content with things as they are,  foster-brother.\"    Therewith so great a sea smote them, that the bulwark was broken and  both the sheets, and four men were washed overboard and all lost.    Then sang Frithiof:              \"Both sheets are bursten            Amid the great billows,            Four swains are sunk            In the fathomless sea?    \"Now, meseems,\" said Frithiof, \"it may well be that some of us will  go to the house of Ran, nor shall we deem us well sped if we come not  thither in glorious array; wherefore it seems good to me that each man  of us here should have somewhat of gold on him.\"    Then he smote asunder the ring, Ingibiorg's gift, and shared it between  all his men, and sang a stave withal:              \"The red ring here I hew me            Once owned of Halfdan's father,            The wealthy lord of erewhile,            Or the sea waves undo us,            So on the guests shall gold be,            If we have need of guesting;            Meet so for mighty men-folk            Amid Ran's hall to hold them.\"    \"Not all so sure is it that we come there,\" said Biorn; \"and yet it may  well be so.\"    Now Frithiof and his folk found that the ship had great way on her, and  they knew not what lay ahead, for all was mirk on either board, so that  none might see the stem or stern from amidships; and therewith was there  great drift of spray amid the furious wind, and frost, and snow, and  deadly cold.    Now Frithiof went up to the masthead, and when he came down he said to  his fellows: \"A sight exceeding wondrous have I seen, for a great whale  went in a ring about the ship, and I misdoubt me that we come nigh to  some land, and that he is keeping the shore against us; for certes  King Helgi has dealt with us in no friendly wise, neither will this  his messenger be friendly. Moreover I saw two women on the back of the  whale, and they it is who will have brought this great storm on us  with the worst of spells and witchcraft; but now we shall try which may  prevail, my fortune or their devilry, so steer ye at your straightest,  and I will smite these evil things with beams.\"              Therewith he sang a stave:            \"See I troll women            Twain on the billows,            Een they whom Helgi            Hither hath sent.            Ellidi now            Or ever her way stop            Shall smile the backs            Of these asunder.\"    So tells the tale that this wonder went with the good ship Ellidi, that  she knew the speech of man.    But Biorn said: \"Now may we see the treason of those brethren against  us.\" Therewith he took the tiller, but Frithiof caught up a forked beam,  and ran into the prow, and sang a stave:              \"Ellidi, hail!            Leap high o'er the billows!            Break of the troll wives            Brow or teeth now!            Break cheek or jaw            Of the cursed woman,            One foot or twain            Of the ogress filthy.\"    Therewith he drave his fork at one of the skin-changers, and the beak of  Ellidi smote the other on the back, and the backs of both were broken;  but the whale took the deep, and gat him gone, and they never saw him  after.    Then the wind fell, but the ship lay waterlogged; so Frithiof called out  to his men, and bade bale out the ship, but Biorn said:    \"No need to work now, verily!\"    \"Be thou not afeard, foster-brother,\" said Frithiof, \"ever was it the  wont of good men of old time to be helpful while they might, whatsoever  should come after.\" And therewith he sang a stave:              \"No need, fairfellows,            To fear the death-day;            Rather be glad,            Good men of mine:            For if dreams wot aught            All nights they say            I yet shall have            My Ingibiorg.\"    Then they baled out the ship; and they were now come nigh unto land; but  there was yet a flaw of wind in their teeth. So then did Frithiof take  the two bow oars again, and rowed full mightily. Therewith the weather  brightened, and they saw that they were come out to Effia Sound, and so  there they made land.    The crew were exceeding weary; but so stout a man was Frithiof that he  bore eight men a-land over the foreshore, but Biorn bore two, and Asmund  one. Then sang Frithiof:              \"Fast bare I up            To the fire-lit house            My men all dazed            With the drift of the storm;            And the sail moreover            To the sand I carried;            With the might of the sea            Is there no more to do.\"          CHAPTER VII.     Frithiof at the Orkneys.    Now Earl Angantyr was at Effia whenas Frithiof and his folk came a-land  there. But his way it was, when he was sitting at the drink, that one  of his men should sit at the watch-window, looking weatherward from the  drinking hall, and keep watch there. From a great horn drank he ever:  and still as one was emptied another was filled for him. And he who held  the watch when Frithiof came a-land was called Hallward; and now he saw  where Frithiof and his men went, and sang a stave:              \"Men see I a-baling            Amid the storm's might;            Six bale on Ellidi            Seven are a-rowing;            Like is he in the stem,            Straining hard at the oars,            To Frithiof the bold,            The brisk in the battle.\"    So when he had drunk out the horn, he cast it in through the window, and  spake to the woman who gave him drink:              \"Take up from the floor,            O fair-going woman,            The horn cast adown            Drunk out to the end!            I behold men at sea            Who, storm-beaten, shall need            Help at our hands            Ere the haven they make.\"    Now the Earl heard what Hallward sang; so he asked for tidings, and  Hallward said: \"Men are come a-land here, much forewearied, yet brave  lads belike: but one of them is so hardy that he beareth the others.  ashore.\"    Then said the Earl, \"Go ye, and meet them, and welcome them in seemly  wise; if this be Frithiof, the son of Hersir Thorstein, my friend, he is  a man famed far and wide for all prowess.\"    Then there took up the word a man named Atli, a great viking, and he  spake: \"Now shall that be proven which is told of, that Frithiof hath  sworn never to be first in the craving of peace.\"    There were ten men in company with him, all evil and outrageous, who  often wrought berserksgang.    So when they met Frithiof they took to their weapons.    But Atli said:    \"Good to turn hither, Frithiof! Clutching ernes should claw; and we no  less, Frithiof! Yea, and now may'st thou hold to thy word, and not crave  first for peace.\"    So Frithiof turned to meet them, and sang a stave:              \"Nay, nay, in nought            Now shall ye cow us.            Blenching hearts            Isle-abiders!            Alone with you ten            The fight will I try,            Rather than pray            For peace at your hands.\"    Then came Hallward thereto, and spake: \"The Earl wills that ye all be  made welcome here: neither shall any set on you.\"    Frithiof said he would take that with a good heart; howsoever he was  ready for either peace or war.    So thereon they went to the Earl, and he made Frithiof and all his men  right welcome, and they abode with him, in great honour holden, through  the wintertide; and oft would the Earl ask of their voyage: so Biorn  sang:              \"There baled we, wight fellows,            Washed over and over            On both boards            By billows;            For ten days we baled there,            And eight thereunto.\"    The Earl said: \"Well nigh did the king undo you; it is ill seen of  such-like kings as are meet for nought but to overcome men by wizardry.  But now I wot,\" says Angantyr, \"of thine errand hither, Frithiof, that  thou art sent after the scat: whereto I give thee a speedy answer, that  never shall King Helgi get scat of me, but to thee will I give money,  even as much as thou wilt; and thou mayest call it scat if thou hast a  mind to, or whatso else thou wilt.\"    So Frithiof"]]]
