The reproof failed  in its effect; the congregation still laughed, and the preacher in the  warmth of his zeal, spoke with still more force and action. The ape  mimicked him so exactly that the congregation could no longer restrain  itself, but burst out into long and continued laughter. A friend of the  preacher at length stepped up to him, and pointed out the cause of this  improper conduct; and such was the roguish air of the animal that it was  with the utmost difficulty that the preacher himself kept from laughing,  while he ordered the servants of the church to take the mischievous ape  away.    [Illustration]          XII    OLD HABITS      A famous Scotch lawyer, having cause to visit London, decided to make  the journey on horseback rather than by post; for this was before the  days of railways. He, therefore, purchased a horse, and on his arrival  in London, sold his nag, planning to buy another for the return journey.  When he had finished his business, and was ready to set out for home, he  went to Smithfield to buy another horse. About dusk, a handsome horse  was offered to him at so cheap a rate, that he suspected the animal  might not be sound; but as he could not find anything the matter with  the horse, he bought it. Next morning he set out on his journey; his  horse had excellent paces, and the first few miles, while the road was  well frequented, our traveller spent in congratulating himself on his  good fortune. On Finchley Common the traveller met a clergyman driving a  one-horse chaise. There was nobody within sight, and the horse by his  actions plainly showed what had been the business of his former master.  Instead of passing the chaise, he laid his breast close up to it, and  stopped it, having no doubt that his rider would take advantage of so  fair a chance of following his trade. The clergyman, under the same  mistake, took out his purse without being asked, and assured the  innocent and surprised horseman that it was not necessary to draw his  pistol. The traveler drew back his horse with apologies to the  gentleman, whom he had unwillingly frightened, and pursued his journey.  The horse next made the same suspicious approach to a coach, from the  windows of which a blunderbuss was leveled, with threats of death to the  rider, who was innocent of all offense in deed or word. In short, after  his life had been once or twice endangered by the suspicions to which  his horse's conduct gave rise, and his liberty as often threatened by  peace officers, who were disposed to seize him as a notorious  highwayman, he found himself obliged to part with the animal for a mere  trifle, and had to purchase at a dearer rate, a horse of less fine  figure and action but of better morals.    [Illustration]          XIII    NOBLE PERSEVERENCE      Elephants were, of old, employed in India in the launching of ships. It  is told of one, that, being directed to force a very large ship into the  water, the work proved to much for its strength. Its master, in  sarcastic tones bade the keeper take away the lazy beast, and bring  another. The poor animal instantly put forth still greater efforts,  fractured his skull, and died on the spot.    [Illustration]          XIV    THE CAT AND THE CROWS      A pair of crows once made their nest in one of the trees that were  planted round the garden of a gentleman, who, in his morning walks, was  often amused by watching furious combats between the crows and a cat.  One morning the battle raged more fiercely than usual, till at last the  cat gave way, and took shelter under a hedge, as if to wait a better  chance of escaping to the house. The crows continued for a short time to  make a threatening noise; but seeing that on the ground they could do  nothing more than threaten, one of them lifted a stone from the middle  of the garden, and perched with it on a tree planted in the hedge, where  she sat, watching the movements of the cat, who, she feared, was after  her little ones. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow  followed her, flying from branch to branch, and from tree to tree; and  when at last puss dared to leave her hiding place, the crow, leaving the  tree, and hovering over her in the air, let the stone drop from on high  on her back.    [Illustration]          XV    HEROISM OF AN IRISH HEN      A contest of rather an unusual nature took place in the house of an  innkeeper in Ireland. The parties engaged were a hen of the game species  and a rat of middle size. The hen, in a walk round a spacious room,  accompanied by an only chicken, the last one left of a large brood, was  roused to madness by an attack made by a fierce rat on her helpless  little one. The frightened cries of her beloved little chick, while it  was being dragged away by the rat, awoke all the mother-love in the  bosom of the hen. She flew at the corner whence he had taken her child,  seized him by the neck, dragged him about the room, put out one of his  eyes, and so tired him by repeated attacks of spur and bill, that in the  space of twelve minutes, during which time the conflict lasted, she  killed the rat, nimbly turned round in triumph to her frightened  nestling, and lovingly sheltered it beneath her protecting wings.    [Illustration]          XVI    THE SHEPHERD'S DOG      James Hogg, the shepherd poet, had a dog named Sirrah, who was for many  years his sole companion. He was, the shepherd says, the best dog he  ever saw, in spite of his surly manners and unattractive appearance. The  first time he saw the dog, a drover was leading him by a rope, and,  although hungry and lean, \"I thought,\" Hogg tells us, \"I saw a sort of  sullen intelligence in his face, so I gave the drover a guinea for him.  I believe there was never a guinea so well spent. He was scarcely a year  old then, and knew nothing of herding; but as soon as he found out that  it was his duty to do so, I can never forget with what eagerness he  learned. He would try every way till he found out what I wanted him to  do; and when once I made him understand a direction, he never forgot or  mistook it again.\"    About seven hundred lambs, which were at once under Mr. Hogg's care,  broke up at midnight, and scampered off in three divisions across the  hills, in spite of all that the shepherd and an assistant lad could do  to keep them together. \"Sirrah,\" cried the shepherd, in great alarm, \"my  man, they're awa.\" The night was so dark that he did not see Sirrah, but  the faithful dog had heard his master's words, and without more ado he  set off in quest of the flock. The shepherd and his companion spent  the whole of the night in scouring the hills, but of neither lambs nor  Sirrah could they obtain the slightest trace. \"We had nothing for it,\"  says the shepherd, \"but to return to our master and tell him that we had  lost his whole flock of lambs. On our way home, however, we came  suddenly upon a body of lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine, and in  front of them was sitting Sirrah, who was looking around for help. We  decided that here was at least one of the divisions which Sirrah had  managed to collect; but what was our astonishment when we discovered  that not one of the whole flock was missing. How he had got all the  divisions together in the dark is beyond my comprehension. I never felt  so grateful to any creature under the sun as I did to my honest Sirrah  that morning.\"    [Illustration]          XVII    TRAVELLERS      An innkeeper once sent, as a present to a friend, a dog and cat that had  been companions for more than ten months. The carrier took them, tied up  in a bag. A short time after the dog and cat set out together, and  returned to their old home, a distance of thirteen miles. They jogged  along the road side by side, and on one occasion the dog gallantly  defended his fellow-traveller from the attack of another dog they met.    [Illustration]          XVIII    FILIAL DUTY      A surgeon's mate on board a ship relates that while he was lying awake  one evening, he saw a rat come into his berth, and after looking  carefully about the place, go away with the greatest care and silence.  Soon after it returned, leading by the ear another rat, which it left at  a small distance from the hole by which they had entered. A third rat  joined this kind conductor; they then foraged about, and picked up all  the small scraps of biscuit; these they carried to the second rat, which  seemed blind, and staid right on the spot where they had left it,  nibbling such food as its faithful friends, whom the story-teller thinks  were its children, brought to it from the more remote parts of the  room.    [Illustration]          XIX    A DOG SHEEP-STEALER      A shepherd, who was hung for sheep-stealing, used to commit the  robberies by means of his dog. Whenever he wished to steal any sheep, he  sent the dog to do the business. He would visit a flock of sheep,  looking them over, as if he intended buying some. The dog was always by  his side, and to him he gave a signal secretly, whenever he saw any  particular sheep he wanted. Sometimes he would pick out ten or twelve  from a flock of some hundreds. Dog and man then went away, and from a  distance of several miles, the dog would be sent back by himself in the  night time. The wise creature picked out the very sheep the man had  selected, separated them from the rest of the flock, and drove them  before him, often a distance of ten or twelve miles, till he came up  with his master, to whom he delivered them up.    [Illustration]          XX    A MOTHER'S AFFECTION      While a ship on a voyage of discovery to the North Pole was locked in  the ice, one morning the man at the masthead reported that three bears  were making their way toward the vessel.

Mystical philosophy, in all ages and in all parts of the world, is  characterised by certain beliefs which are illustrated by the  doctrines we have been considering.    There is, first, the belief in insight as against discursive analytic  knowledge: the belief in a way of wisdom, sudden, penetrating,  coercive, which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of  outward appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses. All  who are capable of absorption in an inward passion must have  experienced at times the strange feeling of unreality in common  objects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity  of the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness,  to bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic  phantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and  living. This is the negative side of the mystic's initiation: the  doubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception  of what seems a higher wisdom. Many men to whom this negative  experience is familiar do not pass beyond it, but for the mystic it is  merely the gateway to an ampler world.    The mystic insight begins with the sense of a mystery unveiled, of a  hidden wisdom now suddenly become certain beyond the possibility of a  doubt. The sense of certainty and revelation comes earlier than any  definite belief. The definite beliefs at which mystics arrive are the  result of reflection upon the inarticulate experience gained in the  moment of insight. Often, beliefs which have no real connection with  this moment become subsequently attracted into the central nucleus;  thus in addition to the convictions which all mystics share, we find,  in many of them, other convictions of a more local and temporary  character, which no doubt become amalgamated with what was essentially  mystical in virtue of their subjective certainty. We may ignore such  inessential accretions, and confine ourselves to the beliefs which all  mystics share.    The first and most direct outcome of the moment of illumination is  belief in the possibility of a way of knowledge which may be called  revelation or insight or intuition, as contrasted with sense, reason,  and analysis, which are regarded as blind guides leading to the morass  of illusion. Closely connected with this belief is the conception of a  Reality behind the world of appearance and utterly different from it.  This Reality is regarded with an admiration often amounting to  worship; it is felt to be always and everywhere close at hand, thinly  veiled by the shows of sense, ready, for the receptive mind, to shine  in its glory even through the apparent folly and wickedness of Man.  The poet, the artist, and the lover are seekers after that glory: the  haunting beauty that they pursue is the faint reflection of its sun.  But the mystic lives in the full light of the vision: what others  dimly seek he knows, with a knowledge beside which all other knowledge  is ignorance.    The second characteristic of mysticism is its belief in unity, and its  refusal to admit opposition or division anywhere. We found Heraclitus  saying \"good and ill are one\"; and again he says, \"the way up and the  way down is one and the same.\" The same attitude appears in the  simultaneous assertion of contradictory propositions, such as: \"We  step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\" The  assertion of Parmenides, that reality is one and indivisible, comes  from the same impulse towards unity. In Plato, this impulse is less  prominent, being held in check by his theory of ideas; but it  reappears, so far as his logic permits, in the doctrine of the primacy  of the Good.    A third mark of almost all mystical metaphysics is the denial of the  reality of Time. This is an outcome of the denial of division; if all  is one, the distinction of past and future must be illusory. We have  seen this doctrine prominent in Parmenides; and among moderns it is  fundamental in the systems of Spinoza and Hegel.    The last of the doctrines of mysticism which we have to consider is  its belief that all evil is mere appearance, an illusion produced by  the divisions and oppositions of the analytic intellect. Mysticism  does not maintain that such things as cruelty, for example, are good,  but it denies that they are real: they belong to that lower world of  phantoms from which we are to be liberated by the insight of the  vision. Sometimes--for example in Hegel, and at least verbally in  Spinoza--not only evil, but good also, is regarded as illusory, though  nevertheless the emotional attitude towards what is held to be Reality  is such as would naturally be associated with the belief that Reality  is good. What is, in all cases, ethically characteristic of mysticism  is absence of indignation or protest, acceptance with joy, disbelief  in the ultimate truth of the division into two hostile camps, the good  and the bad. This attitude is a direct outcome of the nature of the  mystical experience: with its sense of unity is associated a feeling  of infinite peace. Indeed it may be suspected that the feeling of  peace produces, as feelings do in dreams, the whole system of  associated beliefs which make up the body of mystic doctrine. But this  is a difficult question, and one on which it cannot be hoped that  mankind will reach agreement.    Four questions thus arise in considering the truth or falsehood of  mysticism, namely:      I. Are there two ways of knowing, which may be called respectively    reason and intuition? And if so, is either to be preferred to the    other?      II. Is all plurality and division illusory?      III. Is time unreal?      IV. What kind of reality belongs to good and evil?    On all four of these questions, while fully developed mysticism seems  to me mistaken, I yet believe that, by sufficient restraint, there is  an element of wisdom to be learned from the mystical way of feeling,  which does not seem to be attainable in any other manner. If this is  the truth, mysticism is to be commended as an attitude towards life,  not as a creed about the world. The meta-physical creed, I shall  maintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion, although this emotion,  as colouring and informing all other thoughts and feelings, is the  inspirer of whatever is best in Man. Even the cautious and patient  investigation of truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of  the mystic's swift certainty, may be fostered and nourished by that  very spirit of reverence in which mysticism lives and moves.      I. REASON AND INTUITION[3]    Of the reality or unreality of the mystic's world I know nothing. I  have no wish to deny it, nor even to declare that the insight which  reveals it is not a genuine insight. What I do wish to maintain--and  it is here that the scientific attitude becomes imperative--is that  insight, untested and unsupported, is an insufficient guarantee of  truth, in spite of the fact that much of the most important truth is  first suggested by its means. It is common to speak of an opposition  between instinct and reason; in the eighteenth century, the opposition  was drawn in favour of reason, but under the influence of Rousseau and  the romantic movement instinct was given the preference, first by  those who rebelled against artificial forms of government and thought,  and then, as the purely rationalistic defence of traditional theology  became increasingly difficult, by all who felt in science a menace to  creeds which they associated with a spiritual outlook on life and the  world. Bergson, under the name of \"intuition,\" has raised instinct to  the position of sole arbiter of metaphysical truth. But in fact the  opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct,  intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which  subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it  is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other  beliefs no less instinctive. Reason is a harmonising, controlling  force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical  realm, it is insight that first arrives at what is new.    Where instinct and reason do sometimes conflict is in regard to single  beliefs, held instinctively, and held with such determination that no  degree of inconsistency with other beliefs leads to their abandonment.  Instinct, like all human faculties, is liable to error. Those in whom  reason is weak are often unwilling to admit this as regards  themselves, though all admit it in regard to others. Where instinct is  least liable to error is in practical matters as to which right  judgment is a help to survival: friendship and hostility in others,  for instance, are often felt with extraordinary discrimination through  very careful disguises. But even in such matters a wrong impression  may be given by reserve or flattery; and in matters less directly  practical, such as philosophy deals with, very strong instinctive  beliefs are sometimes wholly mistaken, as we may come to know through  their perceived inconsistency with other equally strong beliefs. It is  such considerations that necessitate the harmonising mediation of  reason, which tests our beliefs by their mutual compatibility, and  examines, in doubtful cases, the possible sources of error on the one  side and on the other. In this there is no opposition to instinct as a  whole, but only to blind reliance upon some one interesting aspect of  instinct to the exclusion of other more commonplace but not less  trustworthy aspects. It is such one-sidedness"]]]
