Taking up Baedeker's Handbook to Northern Italy, she  committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History. For  she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the half-hour  crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and  said:    \"I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will  superintend the move.\"    \"How you do do everything,\" said Lucy.    \"Naturally, dear. It is my affair.\"    \"But I would like to help you.\"    \"No, dear.\"    Charlotte's energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her  life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So  Lucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet--there was a rebellious spirit  in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less  delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room  without any feeling of joy.    \"I want to explain,\" said Miss Bartlett, \"why it is that I have taken  the largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;  but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure  your mother would not like it.\"    Lucy was bewildered.    \"If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under  an obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in  my small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a  guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.\"    \"Mother wouldn't mind I'm sure,\" said Lucy, but again had the sense of  larger and unsuspected issues.    Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as  she wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when  she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean  night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the  lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the  foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.    Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the  door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards  led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was  then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on  which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.    \"What does it mean?\" she thought, and she examined it carefully by the  light of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,  obnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to  destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,  since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it  carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it  clean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed  heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.        Chapter II: In Santa Croce with No Baedeker    It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright  bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are  not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport  in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too, to  fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings,  to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble  churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the  embankment of the road.    Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy  foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for  some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the  window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were  overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried to  hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces  to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared--good-looking, undersized  men--wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat  which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them walked officers,  looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning  somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar became entangled in their  ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.  One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of  an archway. Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man  who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.    Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away,  and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of  Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing  but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as  well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on  Lucy's leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window  before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the  best of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin  had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the  crumbs.    A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett  was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the  morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy would  rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of  course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of  course she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy  would stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!    At this point the clever lady broke in.    \"If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you  can neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be  perfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa  Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school  with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one takes  them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly  behind.\"    Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli's  daughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being  so very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a  long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be  delighted.    \"I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you  bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.\"    Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to  see where Santa Croce was.    \"Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.  He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy--he does  not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient  observation.\"    This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and  started with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.  The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.    Miss Lavish--for that was the clever lady's name--turned to the right  along the sunny Lung' Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down  the side streets cut like a knife, didn't it? Ponte alle  Grazie--particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San  Miniato--beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed  a murderer--Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the  river were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then  Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she  stopped, and she cried:    \"A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its  own smell.\"    \"Is it a very nice smell?\" said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother  a distaste to dirt.    \"One doesn't come to Italy for niceness,\" was the retort; \"one comes for  life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!\" bowing right and left. \"Look at that  adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!\"    So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,  short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten's  grace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so  cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,  only increased the sense of festivity.    \"Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will  never repent of a little civility to your inferiors. That is the  true democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you're  shocked.\"    \"Indeed, I'm not!\" exclaimed Lucy. \"We are Radicals, too, out and out.  My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about  Ireland.\"    \"I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.\"    \"Oh, please--! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical  again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our  front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the  Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.\"    \"Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?\"    \"No--in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over  the Weald.\"    Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.    \"What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very  nicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway--a Radical if ever there  was?\"    \"Very well indeed.\"    \"And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?\"    \"Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!\"    Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: \"Oh, you  have property in Surrey?\"    \"Hardly any,\" said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. \"Only thirty  acres--just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.\"    Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her  aunt's Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last  name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#3)"],[1,"males, were fertile,  he thence concluded that they had been bedewed by the prolific fluid in  the cells: but to render his conclusion just, he should first have  ascertained that the female never had copulated, and this he neglected.  The truth is, that, without knowing it, he had used, in his experiments,  a queen after she had commerce with the male. Had he taken a virgin  queen the moment she came from the royal cell, and confined her along  with drones in his vessels, the result would have been opposite; for,  even amidst a seraglio of males, this young queen would never have laid,  as I shall afterwards prove.    The Lusatian observers, and M. Hattorf in particular, thought the queen  was fecundated by herself, without concourse with the males. I shall  here give an abstract of the experiment on which that opinion is  founded.{D}    M. Hattorf took a queen whose virginity he could not doubt. He excluded  all the males both of the large and small species, and, in several days,  he found both eggs and worms. He asserts that there were no drones in  the hive, during the course of the experiment; but although they were  absent, the queen laid eggs, from which came worms: whence he considers  she is impregnated by herself.    Reflecting on this experiment, I do not find it sufficiently accurate.  Males pass with great facility from hive to hive; and M. Hattorf took no  precaution that none was introduced into his. He says, indeed, there was  no male, but is silent respecting the means he adopted to prove the  fact. Though he might be satisfied of no large drone being there, still  a small one might have escaped his vigilance, and fecundated the queen.  With a view to clear up the doubt, I resolved to repeat his experiment,  in the manner described, and without greater care or precaution.    I put a virgin queen into a hive, from which all the males were  excluded, but the bees left at perfect liberty. For several days I  visited the hive, and found new hatched worms in it. Here then is the  same result as M. Hattorf obtained? But before deducing the same  consequence from it, we had to ascertain beyond dispute that no male had  entered the hive. Thus, it was necessary to immerse the bees, and  examine each separately. By this operation, we actually found four small  males. Therefore, to render the experiment decisive, not only was it  requisite to remove all the drones, but also, by some infallible method,  to prevent any from being introduced, which the German naturalist had  neglected.    I prepared to repair this omission, by putting a virgin queen into a  hive, from which the whole males were carefully removed; and to be  physically certain that none should enter, a glass tube was adapted at  the entrance of such dimensions that the working bees could freely pass  and repass, but too narrow for the smallest male. Matters continued thus  for thirty days, the workers departing and returning performed their  usual labours: but the queen remained sterile. At the expiration of this  time, her belly was equally slender as at the moment of her origin. I  repeated the experiment several times, and always with the same  consequence.    Therefore, as a queen, rigorously separated from all commerce with the  male, remains sterile, it is evident she cannot impregnate herself, and  M. Hattorf's opinion is ill-founded.    Hitherto, by endeavouring to confute or verify the conjectures of all  the authors who had preceded me, by new experiments, I acquired the  knowledge of new facts, but these were apparently so contradictory as to  render the solution of the problem still more difficult. While  examining Mr. Debraw's hypothesis, I confined a queen in a hive, from  which all the drones were removed; the queen nevertheless was fertile.  When considering the opinion of M. Hattorf on the contrary, I put a  queen, of whose virginity I was perfectly satisfied, in the same  situation, she remained sterile.    Embarrassed by so many difficulties, I was on the point of abandoning  the subject of my researches, when at length by more attentive  reflection, I thought these contradictions might arise from experiments  made indifferently on virgin queens, and on those with whose history I  was not acquainted from the origin, and which had perhaps been  impregnated unknown to me. Impressed with this idea, I undertook a new  method of observation not on queens fortuitously taken from the hive,  but on females decidedly in a virgin state, and whose history I knew  from the instant they left the cell.    From a very great number of hives, I removed all the virgin females,  and substituted for each a queen taken at the moment of her birth. The  hives were then divided into two classes. From the first, I took the  whole males both large and small, and adapted a glass tube at the  entrance, so narrow, that no drone could pass, but large enough for the  free passage of the common bees. In the hives of the second class, I  left all the drones belonging to them, and even introduced more; and to  prevent them from escaping, a glass tube, also too narrow for the males,  was adapted to the entrance of these hives.    For more than a month, I carefully watched this experiment, made on a  large scale; but much to my surprise, all the queens remained sterile.  Thus it was proved, that queens confined in a hive would continue barren  though amidst a seraglio of males.    This result induced me to suspect that the females could not be  fecundated in the interior of the hive, and that it was necessary for  them to leave it for receiving the approaches of the male. To ascertain  the fact was easy, by a direct experiment; and as the point is  important, I shall relate in detail what was done by my secretary and  myself on the 29. June 1788.    Aware, that in summer the males usually leave the hive at the warmest  time of the day, it was natural for me to conclude that if the queens  were also obliged to go out for impregnation, instinct would induce them  to do so at the same time as the males.    At eleven in the forenoon, we placed ourselves opposite a hive  containing an unimpregnated queen five days old. The sun had shone from  his rising; the air was very warm; and the males began to leave the  hives. We then enlarged the entrance of that which we wished to observe,  and paid great attention to the bees that entered and departed. The  males appeared, and immediately took flight. Soon afterwards, the young  queen appeared at the entrance; at first she did not fly, but brushed  her belly with her hind legs, and traversed the board a little; neither  workers nor males paid any attention to her. At last, she took flight.  When several feet from the hive, she returned, and approached it as if  to examine the place of her departure, perhaps judging this precaution  necessary to recognize it; she then flew away, describing horizontal  circles twelve or fifteen feet above the earth. We contracted the  entrance of the hive that she might not return unobserved, and placed  ourselves in the centre of the circles described in her flight, the more  easily to follow her and observe all her motions. But she did not remain  long in a situation favourable for us, and rapidly rose out of sight. We  resumed our place before the hive; and in seven minutes, the young queen  returned to the entrance of a habitation which she had left for the  first time. Having found no external appearance of fecundation, we  allowed her to enter. In a quarter of an hour she re-appeared; and,  after brushing herself as before, took flight. Then returning to examine  the hive, she rose so high that we soon lost sight of her. Her second  absence was much longer than the first; twenty-seven minutes elapsed  before she came back. We then found her in a state very different from  that in which she was after her first excursion. The sexual organs were  distended by a white substance, thick and hard, very much resembling the  fluid in the vessels of the male, completely similar to it indeed in  colour and consistence{E}.    But more evidence than mere resemblance was requisite to establish that  the female had returned with the prolific fluid of the males. We allowed  this queen to enter the hive, and confined her there. In two days, we  found her belly swoln; and she had already laid near an hundred eggs in  the worker's cells.    To confirm our discovery, we made several other experiments, and with  the same success. I shall continue to transcribe my journal.    On the second of July, the weather being very fine, numbers of males  left the hives. We set at liberty an unimpregnated young queen, eleven  days old, whose hive had always been deprived of males. Having quickly  left the hive, she returned to examine it, and then rose out of sight.  In a few minutes, she returned without any external marks of  impregnation. In a quarter of an hour, she departed again, but her  flight was so rapid that we could scarcely follow her a moment. This  absence continued thirty minutes. On returning, the last ring of the  body was open, and the sexual organs full of the whitish substance  already mentioned. She was then replaced in the hive from which all the  males were excluded. In two days, we found her impregnated.    These observations at length demonstrate why M. Hattorf obtained results  so different from ours. His queens, though in hives deprived of males,  had been fecundated, and he thence concludes that sexual intercourse is  not requisite for their impregnation. But he did not confine the queens  to their hives, and they had profited by their liberty to unite with the  males. We, on the contrary, have surrounded our queens with a number of  males; but they continued sterile; because the precaution of confining  the males to their hives had also prevented the queens from departing to  seek that fecundation without, which they could not obtain within.    These experiments were repeated on"]]]
