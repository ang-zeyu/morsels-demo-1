In this way four or five rows of bulls drink, one after the  other, and go to the back of the herd.    Next come about a dozen rows of _cow buffaloes_ and their calves, or  children. You see again, like the elephants, the Mammas and children  among the buffaloes are also _in the middle_, safe from all harm.    Then at the end there are four or five rows of bull buffaloes again,  to guard the Mammas and the children from enemies in the back.      _Buffalo Knights Guard the Timid Deer_    But wait a moment! Before the buffaloes go away, a most wonderful  thing happens. You have read stories, how once upon a time there were  brave knights who used to come to the help of ladies who were in  danger. Well, you will be glad to know that these bull buffaloes are  just like those brave knights. Do you see that timid little shadow  creeping in by the side of the buffaloes?    She is a _blue deer_, a very timid lady indeed; for she knows that a  tiger is waiting in the high ground behind, to catch her. It is the  last chance of the tiger to get his supper; so he waits by the high  ground behind, and watches for some weak animal like the deer to come  to drink.    But the blue deer knows that; so she hides in the bushes, and waits  for the buffaloes to come to drink. Then as the buffaloes come to the  water, row after row, horn to horn, she tries to creep in toward them;  she even tries to creep in _under_ the horns of the buffaloes, knowing  that there she will be quite safe from the tiger. It takes her a long  time to reach the buffaloes in that way, without being caught by the  tiger.    But do you see the wonderful thing? The buffaloes wait a little for  her! They take a little longer to drink, to give her a chance to reach  the water by their side. Like the brave knights, they feel proud of  helping a lady.    Now see! The blue deer also has finished drinking. She goes away with  the buffaloes, under their horns. They all reach the jungle again. She  looks carefully: the tiger is watching her, but he dares not come too  near. She sees where he is--then suddenly she gives a leap--another  leap--and another--quickly! The tiger leaps after her--but she leaped  first! She is gone! She is safe!    [Illustration: The Buffaloes and the Blue Deer]    The tiger is furious. He stands a moment before the buffaloes,  growling with rage. But the bulls in front of the herd paw the ground,  and rattle their horns with one another. They are going to charge!    But that tiger does not wait for the charge of the bull buffaloes. He  does not want to be trampled into a mess under their hoofs, or cut up  into pieces with their horns. Instead, he sneaks away, growling. He  sneaks back to the stream, to wait for some other weak animal.    So, you see, the jungle folks are in many ways just like us; for a  brave man always helps a lady or anybody who needs his help.    But now let us watch the stream higher up.      _Wild Pigs--Careless_    Here come the _wild pigs_. They are not exactly a herd; but still  there are many dozens of them, all one large family with all their  relations--cousins and uncles and aunts. Some of the wild pigs are  called _boars_; they are the Papas among the wild pigs. You can always  tell them by the two _sharp tusks_, or teeth, one on each side, which  grow _upward_ from their under jaw. Each tusk is as long as a knife,  and so sharp that a tiger does not always care to fight with a boar.    The wild pigs drink in any fashion, and go off in any fashion--just as  they like. They trust to luck or to the sharp tusks of some of the  boars to guard them from danger. But they have not learned enough yet  to do things in proper order.      _Red Dogs--Bold, Fearing Nobody_    Meanwhile other animals have also come. The moon is now quite high in  the sky. A band of shadows in the moonlight seems to fall upon the  water. It is a pack of _red dogs_; they have come boldly, as they are  afraid of nothing. For if a hungry tiger attacks them, the whole pack  will jump on the tiger and tear him down--that is, the tiger could  kill dozens of the dogs in a few minutes, but then the rest of the  wild red dogs would tear the tiger to pieces.    So the red dogs are not afraid as they come flocking to the stream.  They lap up the water with their lolling tongues. Then they look up at  the moon. Do you see what they are doing? Can you _hear_ them? They  are _howling at the moon in a chorus_. Dogs always howl at the moon.  Men do not quite know just why dogs do that. But perhaps they do it  because they are glad and satisfied, and are trying to _sing!_ When  _you_ sing, and there is a dog near by, you may hear him start  howling. He does that, I suppose, because he likes your singing, and  wants to join in the chorus!    So the wild dogs of the jungle also howl when they are glad. Then,  after the red dogs have howled as long as a song, they scamper off  into the jungle again. That shows, I suppose, that their howling was  really a song!      _Other Animals Come Alone_    The red dogs are the last of the animals that come in a bunch. Now you  see other animals coming one by one. A sneaking shadow there! It must  be a _hyena_. That is an animal that eats what remains from some other  animal's supper; so the hyena waits to see if a tiger or a leopard has  caught any supper, or else it will have to go hungry.    But hush! Here is a _red deer_ coming carefully to the water. This  animal is much bigger than the blue deer, and more able to take care  of herself. But, still, she comes very quietly, looking to right and  left to make sure that the tiger is not just in that place. She  reaches the water and starts drinking. But do you see how her ear is  bent to the side? The red deer is listening most carefully, even while  she is drinking!    But look, look! The bush behind the deer parts very slowly, and a huge  yellow form crouches there! It is the tiger!    He is not near enough to jump on the deer; so he takes one step  forward--as softly as a cat!    But the deer has heard the footfall! For she can hear even a leaf when  it falls to the ground. And in that one second, even while she was  drinking, the red deer has turned and leaped to the side. The tiger  has also leaped at the same time, and he aimed at the place where the  deer _was_. But the deer has just left that place, and the next second  she gives another leap, like a flash, and gets out of the tiger's  reach.    The tiger stands where he leaped, and growls with rage. He knows it  would be no use chasing the deer, as _the deer can run much faster_.  So he stands there, and growls for quite a while. Then, as he did not  get any supper that night, he can at least have a drink. So he drinks  and goes away, still growling.    Now all is quiet at last at the midnight pool, as all the animals have  gone away.      _The Law of the Jungle--Clear Water for All_    But before _we_ leave the place, I want you to remember something. I  showed you first the elephants; they were on our right--that is,  _down_ the stream, the way the water flows. And the elephants drank  first among all the animals.    Then all the other animals came to the stream, but more to our  left--that is, _up_ the stream. Why was that? Think!    I shall tell you. By the time the elephants finish drinking by dipping  their trunks into the stream many times, the water begins to get  muddy. In fact, after drinking, the elephants jump into the water to  have a bath and a swim, as I shall tell you in the next chapter.    So the water gets muddy near the elephants and all the way down stream  from that place, as the water flows that way. And as the other animals  do not want muddy water to drink, they always go _up_ the stream,  where the water is still clear.    That is _The Law of the Jungle_, though it is not written down in a  book, like the laws among men. The Law of the Jungle says that as the  elephants are the lords of the jungle, they shall drink _first_: but  they must be careful to drink _down the stream_, so that all the other  animals may have a place higher up, where they can get _clear water to  drink_.    And that law has never been broken, for many thousands of years, among  all the different sorts of animals.    But with men the laws among the different sorts of people, called  nations, are often broken, because some of them want all the best  things and the best places, and do not care if they muddy the water  that their neighbors have to drink.    So, my dear children, we can learn many things from the animals, even  how to be better men and women when we grow up.          CHAPTER III    The Elephants' Bath      I have just told you that, after drinking, the elephants jump into the  water and have a bath and a swim. That is, all the grown-up elephants  do that, while the little ones stay on the bank and play about.    But, you may ask, why does not the tiger try to grab one of the little  ones then? Because even when the Mammas go into the water they keep  their eyes on the babies, who play quite near by, so that the Mammas  can come to them any minute.    And the Mammas can _smell_ a tiger a little before he gets there, so  that they have enough time to climb out of the water. Besides, the  babies themselves can smell the tiger when he is coming; then they  call out to their Mammas by making a queer rumbling sound in their  throats, and the Mammas come to them at once, before the tiger can get  there.    So all the grown-up elephants can go into the water, without any  worry. And at first they have a regular shower bath.    How do they do that? Why, each elephant fills his trunk with water;  then he curls up the trunk in the air over his head and squirts the  water out, and it falls in a shower all over his body. You can see how  he does it in the picture. All the grown-up elephants do that, and  even those that are half grown.    After the shower"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#3)"],[1,"of the chemical and physical properties of hydraulic  cements and for the methods of determining these properties by tests,  the reader is referred to \"Practical Cement Testing,\" by W. Purves  Taylor.    ~PORTLAND CEMENT.~--Portland cement is the best of the hydraulic cements.  Being made from a rigidly controlled artificial mixture of lime, silica  and alumina the product of the best mills is a remarkably strong,  uniform and stable material. It is suitable for all classes of concrete  work and is the only variety of hydraulic cement allowable for  reinforced concrete or for plain concrete having to endure hard wear or  to be used where strength, density and durability of high degree are  demanded.    ~NATURAL CEMENT.~--Natural cement differs from Portland cement in degree  only. It is made by calcining and grinding a limestone rock containing  naturally enough clayey matter (silica and alumina) to make a cement  that will harden under water. Owing to the imperfection and irregularity  of the natural rock mixture, natural cement is weaker and less uniform  than Portland cement. Natural cement concrete is suitable for work in  which great unit strength or uniformity of quality is not essential. It  is never used for reinforced work.    ~SLAG CEMENT.~--Slag cement has a strength approaching very closely that  of Portland cement, but as it will not stand exposure to the air slag  cement concrete is suitable for use only under water. Slag cement is  made by grinding together slaked lime and granulated blast furnace slag.    ~SIZE AND WEIGHT OF BARRELS OF CEMENT.~--The commercial unit of  measurement of cement is the barrel; the unit of shipment is the bag. A  barrel of Portland cement contains 380 lbs. of cement, and the barrel  itself weighs 20 lbs.; there are four bags (cloth or paper sacks) of  cement to the barrel, and the regulation cloth sack weighs 1½ lbs.  The size of cement barrels varies, due to the differences in weight of  cement and to differences in compacting the cement into the barrel. A  light burned Portland cement weighs 100 lbs. per struck bushel; a heavy  burned Portland cement weighs 118 to 125 lbs. per struck bushel. The  number of cubic feet of packed Portland cement in a barrel ranges from 3  to 3½. Natural cements are lighter than Portland cement. A barrel of  Louisville, Akron, Utica or other Western natural cement contains 265  lbs. of cement and weighs 15 lbs. itself; a barrel of Rosendale or other  Eastern cement contains 300 lbs. of cement and the barrel itself weighs  20 lbs. There are 3-¾ cu. ft. in a barrel of Louisville cement. Usually  there are three bags to a barrel of natural cement.    As stated above, the usual shipping unit for cement is the bag, but  cement is often bought in barrels or, for large works, in bulk. When  bought in cloth bags, a charge is made of 10 cts. each for the bags,  but on return of the bags a credit of 8 to 10 cts. each is allowed.  Cement bought in barrels costs 10 cts. more per barrel than in bulk, and  cement ordered in paper bags costs 5 cts. more per barrel than in bulk.  Cement is usually bought in cloth sacks which are returned, but to get  the advantage of this method of purchase the user must have an accurate  system for preserving, checking up and shipping the bags.    Where any considerable amount of cement is to be used the contractor  will find that it will pay to erect a small bag house or to close off a  room at the mixing plant. Provide the enclosure with a locked door and  with a small window into which the bags are required to be thrown as  fast as emptied. One trustworthy man is given the key and the task of  counting up the empty bags each day to see that they check with the bags  of cement used. The following rule for packing and shipping is given by  Gilbreth.[A]    [Footnote A: \"Field System,\" Frank B. Gilbreth. Myron C. Clark  Publishing Co., New York and Chicago.]    \"Pack cement bags laid flat, one on top of the other, in piles of 50.  They can then be counted easily. Freight must be prepaid when cement  bags are returned and bills of lading must be obtained in duplicate or  credit cannot be obtained on shipment.\"    The volumes given above are for cement compacted in the barrel. When the  cement is emptied and shoveled into boxes it measures from 20 to 30 per  cent more than when packed in the barrel. The following table compiled  from tests made for the Boston Transit Commission, Mr. Howard Carson,  Chief Engineer, in 1896, shows the variation in volume of cement  measured loose and packed in barrels:                                                          Per cent  Brand              Vol. Barrel   Vol. Packed   Vol. Loose   Increase  Portland.          cu. ft.         cu. ft.      cu. ft.     in bulk    Giant              3.5            3.35         4.17        25    Atlas              3.45           3.21         3.75        18    Saylors            3.25           3.15         4.05        30    Alsen              3.22           3.16         4.19        33    Dyckerhoff         3.12           3.03         4.00        33    Mr. Clarence M. Foster is authority for the statement that Utica cement  barrels measure 16-1/4 ins. across at the heads, 19½ ins. across the  bilge, and 25-3/4 ins. in length under heads, and contain 3.77 cu. ft.  When 265 lbs. of Utica natural hydraulic cement are packed in a barrel  it fills it within 2½ ins. of the top and occupies 3.45 cu. ft., and  this is therefore the volume of a barrel of Utica hydraulic cement  packed tight.    In comparative tests made of the weights and volumes of various brands  of cements at Chicago in 1903, the following figures were secured:                         Vol. per        Weight per     Weight per                     bbl., cu. ft.     bbl., lbs.       cu. ft.

The various government  bureaus, state and city works departments, railway companies, and most  public service corporations have their own specifications. Standard  specifications are also put forward by several of the national  engineering societies, and one of these or the personal specification of  the engineer is used for individual works. Buying cement to  specification necessitates testing to determine that the material  purchased meets the specified requirements. For a complete discussion of  the methods of conducting such tests the reader is referred to  \"Practical Cement Testing\" by W. Purves Taylor.    According to this authority a field testing laboratory will cost for  equipment $250 to $350. Such a laboratory can be operated by two or  three men at a salary charge of from $100 to $200 per month. Two men  will test on an average four samples per day and each additional man  will test four more samples. The cost of testing will range from $3 to  $5 per sample, which is roughly equivalent to 3 cts. per barrel of  cement, or from 3 to 5 cts. per cubic yard of concrete. These figures  are for field laboratory work reasonably well conducted under ordinarily  favorable conditions. In large laboratories the cost per sample will run  somewhat lower.      SAND.    Sand constitutes from 1/3 to 1/2 of the volume of concrete; when a large  amount of concrete is to be made a contractor cannot, therefore, afford  to guess at his source of sand supply. A long haul over poor roads can  easily make the sand cost more than the stone per cubic yard of  concrete.    ~PROPERTIES OF GOOD SAND.~--Engineers commonly specify that sand for  concrete shall be clean and sharp, and silicious in character. Neither  sharpness nor excessive cleanliness is worth seeking after if it  involves much expense. Tests show conclusively that sand with rounded  grains makes quite as strong a mortar, other things being equal, as does  sand with angular grains. The admixture with sand of a considerable  percentage of loam or clay is also not the unmixed evil it has been  supposed to be. Myron S. Falk records[B] a number of elaborate  experiments on this point. These experiments demonstrate conclusively  that loam and clay in sand to the amount of 10 to 15 per cent. result in  no material reduction in the strength of mortars made with this sand as  compared with mortars made with the same sand after washing. There can  be no doubt but that for much concrete work the expense entailed in  washing sand is an unnecessary one.    [Footnote B: \"Cements, Mortars and Concretes\" By Myron S. Falk. Myron C.  Clark Publishing Co., Chicago, Ill.]    The only substitute for natural sand for concrete, that need be  considered practically, is pulverized stone, either the dust and fine  screenings produced in crushing rock or an artificial sand made by  reducing suitable rocks to powder. As a conclusion from the records of  numerous tests, M. S. Falk says: \"It may be concluded that rock  screenings may be substituted for sand, either in mortar or concrete,  without any loss of strength resulting. This is important commercially,  for it precludes the necessity of screening the dust from crushed rock  and avoids, at the same time, the cost of procuring a natural sand to  take its place.\"    The principal danger in using stone dust is failure to secure the proper  balance of different size grains. This is also an important matter in  the choice of natural sands. Sand composed of a mixture of grains  ranging from fine to coarse gives uniformly stronger mortars than does  sand with grains of nearly one size,"]]]
