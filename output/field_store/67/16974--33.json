Constitution  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Country data codes  see Data codes    Country map  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps  were produced from the best information available at the time of  preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name  This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional  long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local  long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the  Terminology note.    Crude oil  See entry for oil.    Currency (code)  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and, in  parenthesis, gives the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.    Current account balance  This entry records a country's net trade in goods and services, plus  net earnings from rents, interest, profits, and dividends, and net  transfer payments (such as pension funds and worker remittances) to and  from the rest of the world during the period specified. These figures  are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Data codes  This information is presented in Appendix D: Cross-Reference List of  Country Data Codes and Appendix E: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic  Data Codes.    Date of information  In general, information available as of 1 January 2005, was used in the  preparation of this edition.    Death rate  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death  rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a  country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all  ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt - external  This entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents  repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Dependency status  This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation  The US Government has diplomatic relations with 187 independent states,  including 186 of the 191 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US has  diplomatic relations with 1 independent state that is not in the UN -  Holy See.    Diplomatic representation from the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation in the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, chancery, telephone, FAX,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Disputes - international  This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving borders  or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,  geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does  not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US  Government.    Distribution of family income - Gini index  This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of  family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz  curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number  of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the  ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45  degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45  degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the  closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini  index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more  unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve  from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-  Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with  perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree  line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with  perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal  axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.    Economic aid - donor  This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations to  developing countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as  financial assistance that is concessional in character, has the main  objective to promote economic development and welfare of the less  developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant element of at least  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or private  flows. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,  not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Economic aid - recipient  This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and  statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development  Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and  from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included  in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.  Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The  entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments. These  figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in  purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Economy  This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,  and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy - overview  This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree  of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most  important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It  also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most  recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key  future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption  This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy  between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in  transmission and distribution.    Electricity - exports  This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - imports  This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.    Electricity - production  This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed in kilowatt-  hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted  for as loss in transmission and distribution.    Elevation extremes  This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point.    Entities  Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. \"Independent state\" refers to a people politically  organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.  \"Dependencies\" and \"areas of special sovereignty\" refer to a broad  category of political entities that are associated in some way with an  independent state. \"Country\" names used in the table of contents or for  page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,  dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic  entities. There are a total of 271 separate geographic entities in The  World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:  INDEPENDENT STATES  192 Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and  Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, The  Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,  Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil,  Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,  Canada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, China,  Colombia, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech  Republic, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, East Timor,  Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia,  Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Georgia, Germany,  Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana,  Haiti, Holy See, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran,  Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan,  Kenya, Kiribati, North Korea, South Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos,  Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#3)"],[1,"her hauteur, reassured him with a smile. Foedor rose, his  heart filled with inexplicable joy, and without being able to say what  had caused this feeling, he only knew that it had made him absolutely  happy, so that, although he was just about to leave Vaninka, he had  never felt greater happiness in his life.    The young man left dreaming golden dreams; for his future, be it gloomy  or bright, was to be envied. If it ended in a soldier's grave, he  believed he had seen in Vaninka's eyes that she would mourn him; if his  future was glorious, glory would bring him back to St. Petersburg in  triumph, and glory is a queen, who works miracles for her favourites.    The army to which the young officer belonged crossed Germany, descended  into Italy by the Tyrolese mountains, and entered Verona on the 14th of  April 1799. Souvarow immediately joined forces with General Melas, and  took command of the two armies. General Chasteler next day suggested  that they should reconnoitre. Souvarow, gazing at him with astonishment,  replied, \"I know of no other way of reconnoitring the enemy than by  marching upon him and giving him battle.\"    As a matter of fact Souvarow was accustomed to this expeditious sort of  strategy: through it he had defeated the Turks at Folkschany and  Ismailoff; and he had defeated the Poles, after a few days' campaign,  and had taken Prague in less than four hours. Catherine, out of  gratitude, had sent her victorious general a wreath of oak-leaves,  intertwined with precious stones, and worth six hundred thousand  roubles, a heavy gold field-marshal's baton encrusted with diamonds; and  had created him a field-marshal, with the right of choosing a regiment  that should bear his name from that time forward. Besides, when he  returned to Russia, she gave him leave of absence, that he might take a  holiday at a beautiful estate she had given him, together with the eight  thousand serfs who lived upon it.    What a splendid example for Foedor! Souvarow, the son of a humble  Russian officer, had been educated at the ordinary cadets' training  college, and had left it as a sub-lieutenant like himself. Why should  there not be two Souvarows in the same century?    Souvarow arrived in Italy preceded by an immense reputation; religious,  strenuous, unwearied, impassible, loving with the simplicity of a Tartar  and fighting with the fury of a Cossack, he was just the man required to  continue General Melas's successes over the soldiers of the Republic,  discouraged as they had been by the weak vacillations of Scherer.    The Austro-Russian army of one hundred thousand men was opposed by only  twenty-nine or thirty thousand French. Souvarow began as usual with a  thundering blow. On 20th April he appeared before Brescia, which made a  vain attempt at resistance; after a cannonade of about half an hour's  duration, the Preschiera gate was forced, and the Korsakow division, of  which Foedor's regiment formed the vanguard, charged into the town,  pursuing the garrison, which only consisted of twelve hundred men, and  obliged them to take refuge in the citadel. Pressed with an impetuosity  the French were not accustomed to find in their enemies, and seeing that  the scaling ladders were already in position against the ramparts, the  captain Boucret wished to come to terms; but his position was too  precarious for him to obtain any conditions from his savage conquerors,  and he and his soldiers were made prisoners of war.    Souvarow was experienced enough to know how best to profit by victory;  hardly master of Brescia, the rapid occupation of which had discouraged  our army anew, he ordered General Kray to vigorously press on the siege  of Preschiera. General Kray therefore established his headquarters at  Valeggio, a place situated at an equal distance between Preschiera and  Mantua, and he extended from the Po to the lake of Garda, on the banks  of the Mencio, thus investing the two cities at the same time.    Meanwhile the commander-in-chief had advanced, accompanied by the larger  part of his forces, and had crossed the Oglio in two columns: he  launched one column, under General Rosenberg, towards Bergamo, and the  other, with General Melas in charge, towards the Serio, whilst a body of  seven or eight thousand men, commanded by General Kaim and General  Hohenzollern, were directed towards Placentia and Cremona, thus  occupying the whole of the left bank of the Po, in such a manner that  the Austro-Russian army advanced deploying eighty thousand men along a  front of forty-five miles.    In view of the forces which were advancing, and which were three times  as large as his own, Scherer beat a retreat all along the line. He  destroyed the bridges over the Adda, as he did not consider that he was  strong enough to hold them, and, having removed his headquarters to  Milan, he awaited there the reply to a despatch which he had sent to the  Directory, in which, tacitly acknowledging his incapacity, he tendered  his resignation. As the arrival of his successor was delayed, and as  Souvarow continued to advance, Scherer, more and more terrified by the  responsibility which rested upon him, relinquished his command into the  hands of his most able lieutenant. The general chosen by him was Moreau,  who was again about to fight those Russians in whose ranks he was  destined to die at last.    Moreau's unexpected nomination was proclaimed amidst the acclamation of  the soldiers. He had been called the French Fabius, on account of his  magnificent campaign on the Rhine. He passed his whole army in review,  saluted by the successive acclamations of its different divisions, which  cried, \"Long live Moreau! Long live the saviour of the army of Italy!\"  But however great this enthusiasm, it did not blind Moreau to the  terrible position in which he found himself. At the risk of being  out-flanked, it was necessary for him to present a parallel line to that  of the Russian army, so that, in order to face his enemy, he was obliged  to extend his line from Lake Lecco to Pizzighitone--that is to say, a  distance of fifty miles. It is true that he might have retired towards  Piedmont and concentrated his troops at Alexandria, to await there the  reinforcements the Directory had promised to send him. But if he had  done this, he would have compromised the safety of the army at Naples,  and have abandoned it, isolated as it was, to the mercy of the enemy. He  therefore resolved to defend the passage of the Adda as long as  possible, in order to give the division under Dessolles, which was to be  despatched to him by Massena, time to join forces with him and to defend  his left, whilst Gauthier, who had received orders to evacuate Tuscany  and to hasten with forced marches to his aid, should have time to arrive  and protect his right. Moreau himself took the centre, and personally  defended the fortified bridge of Cassano; this bridge was protected by  the Ritorto Canal, and he also defended it with a great deal of  artillery and an entrenched vanguard. Besides, Moreau, always as prudent  as brave, took every precaution to secure a retreat, in case of  disaster, towards the Apennines and the coast of Genoa. Hardly were his  dispositions completed before the indefatigable Souvarow entered  Triveglio. At the same time as the Russian commander-in-chief arrived at  this last town, Moreau heard of the surrender of Bergamo and its castle,  and on 23rd April he saw the heads of the columns of the allied army.    The same day the Russian general divided his troops into three strong  columns, corresponding to the three principal points in the French line,  each column numerically more than double the strength of those to whom  they were opposed. The right column, led by General Wukassowich,  advanced towards Lake Lecco, where General Serrurier awaited it. The  left column, under the command of Melas, took up its position in front  of the Cassano entrenchments; and the Austrian division, under Generals  Zopf and Ott, which formed the centre, concentrated at Canonia, ready at  a given moment to seize Vaprio. The Russian and Austrian troops  bivouacked within cannon-shot of the French outposts.    That evening, Foedor, who with his regiment formed part of Chasteler's  division, wrote to General Tchermayloff:    \"We are at last opposite the French, and a great battle must take place  to-morrow morning; tomorrow evening I shall be a lieutenant or a  corpse.\"    Next morning, 26th April, cannon resounded at break of day from the  extremities of the lines; on our left Prince Bagration's grenadiers  attacked us, on our right General Seckendorff, who had been detached  from the camp of Triveglio, was marching on Crema.    These two attacks met with very different success. Bagration's  grenadiers were repulsed with terrible loss, whilst Seckendorff, on the  contrary, drove the French out of Crema, and pushed forward towards the  bridge of Lodi. Foedor's predictions were falsified: his portion of the  army did nothing the whole day; his regiment remained motionless,  waiting for orders that did not come.    Souvarow's arrangements were not yet quite complete, the night was  needed for him to finish them. During the night, Moreau, having heard of  Seckendorff's success on his extreme right, sent an order to Serrurier  commanding him to leave at Lecco, which was an easy post to defend, the  18th light brigade and a detachment of dragoons only, and to draw back  with the rest of his troops towards the centre. Serrurier received this  order about two o'clock in the morning, and executed it immediately.    On their side the Russians had lost no time, profiting by the darkness  of the night. General Wukassowich had repaired the bridge at Brevio,  which had been destroyed by the French, whilst General Chasteler had  built another bridge two miles below the castle of Trezzo. These two  bridges had been, the one repaired and the other built,"]]]
