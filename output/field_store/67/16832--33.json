Finally he laid down his  pipe and sprang to his feet.    \"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the  cliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to  find them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without  sufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to  pieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will  come.    \"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we  skirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very  little which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready  to fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that  neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the  affairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.  Very good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously  stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm  ground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative  to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left  the room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it  was within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the  table. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not  changed their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,  that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later  than eleven o'clock last night.    \"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of  Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no  difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as  you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot  expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might  otherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.  Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not  difficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among  others and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away  swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.    \"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some  outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that  person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter  may be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence  that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced  so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their  senses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer  Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement  in the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,  cloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people  would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he  could be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this  window, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,  then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon  the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and  elaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"    \"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.    \"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not  insurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive  archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.  Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are  available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of  neolithic man.\"    I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but  never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in  Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and  shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his  solution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our  cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds  back to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that  visitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the  fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed  our cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near  the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all  these were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be  associated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the  great lion-hunter and explorer.    We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice  caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no  advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,  as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him  to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a  small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,  amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,  attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to  the affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to  hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any  advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county  police are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider  experience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim  to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences  here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,  upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their  strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you  that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news  reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the  inquiry.\"    Holmes raised his eyebrows.    \"Did you lose your boat through it?\"    \"I will take the next.\"    \"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"    \"I tell you they were relatives.\"    \"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"    \"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"    \"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the  Plymouth morning papers.\"    \"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"    \"Might I ask from whom?\"    A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.    \"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"It is my business.\"    With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.    \"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,  the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original  question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of  this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It  would be premature to say more.\"    \"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any  particular direction?\"    \"No, I can hardly answer that.\"    \"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous  doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within  five minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the  evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which  assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.  He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.    \"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it  from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's  account was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night  there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to  Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do  you make of that, Watson?\"    \"He is deeply interested.\"    \"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet  grasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson,  for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.  When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"    Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or  how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up  an entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in  the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a  dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door,  and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden  path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.    Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last  in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.    \"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he  cried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his  hands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it  were not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his  terrible news.    \"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the  same symptoms as the rest of his family.\"    Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.    \"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"    \"Yes, I can.\"    \"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are  entirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get  disarranged.\"    The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle  by themselves, the one above the other.

Articles of agreement were drawn up by the royal secretary at once.  Columbus was to have for himself during his life, and his heirs and  successors for ever, the office of admiral of all lands and continents  which he might discover.    Secondly: He was to be viceroy and governor-general over them.    Thirdly: He was to be entitled to receive for himself one-tenth of all  pearls, precious stones, gold, silver, spices, and all other articles  and merchandise obtained within this admiralty.    Fourthly: He or his lieutenant was to be the sole judge in all cases and  disputes arising out of traffic between those countries and Spain.    Fifthly: He might then, and at all after times, contribute an eighth  part of the expense in fitting out vessels to sail on this enterprise,  and receive one-eighth part of the profit.    The latter engagement he fulfilled through the assistance of the Pinzons  of Palos, and added a third vessel to the armament.    Thus, one-eighth of the expense attendant on this grand expedition,  undertaken by a powerful nation, was actually borne by the individual  who conceived it, and who likewise risked his life on its success.    The capitulations were afterwards signed by Ferdinand and Isabella on  the 17th of April, 1492, when, in addition to the above articles,  Columbus and his heirs were authorised to prefix the title of Don to  their names.    It was arranged that the armament should be fitted out at the port of  Palos, Columbus calculating on the co-operation of his friends Martin  Alonzo Pinzon and the Prior of the convent.    Both Isabella and Columbus were influenced by a pious zeal for effecting  the great work of salvation among the potentates and peoples of the  lands to be discovered.  He expected to arrive at the extremity of the  ocean, and to open up direct communication with the vast and magnificent  empire of the Grand Khan of Tartary.  His deep and cherished design was  the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, which he meditated during the  remainder of his life, and solemnly provided for in his will.    Let those who are disposed to faint under difficulties in the  prosecution of any great and worthy undertaking, remember that eighteen  years elapsed after the time that Columbus conceived his enterprise,  before he was able to carry it into effect; that the greater part of  that time was passed in almost hopeless solicitation, amidst poverty,  neglect, and taunting ridicule; that the prime of his life had wasted  away in the struggle; and that when his perseverance was finally crowned  with success, he had reached his fifty-sixth year.

Columbus hastened to Palos, where he was received as the guest of Fray  Juan Perez, the worthy Prior of the convent of Rabida.  The whole  squadron with which the two sovereigns proposed to carry out their grand  undertaking was to consist only of three small vessels.  Two of these,  by a royal decree, were to be furnished by Palos, the other by Columbus  himself or his friends.    The morning after his arrival, Columbus, accompanied by the Prior,  proceeded to the church of Saint George in Palos, where the authorities  and principal inhabitants had been ordered to attend.  Here the royal  order was read by a notary public, commanding them to have two caravels  ready for sea in ten days, they and their crews to be placed at the  disposal of Columbus.  He himself was empowered to procure and fit out a  third vessel.    Orders were likewise read, addressed to the public authorities, and the  people of all ranks and conditions in the maritime borders of Andalusia,  commanding them to furnish supplies and assistance of all kinds for  fitting out the caravels.    When, however, the nature of the service was explained, the owners of  vessels refused to furnish them, and the seamen shrank from sailing into  the wilderness of the ocean.    Several weeks elapsed, and not a vessel had been procured.  The  sovereigns therefore issued further orders, directing the magistrates to  press into the service any caravel they might select, and to compel the  masters and crews to sail with Columbus in whatever direction he should  be sent.    Notwithstanding this nothing was done, until at length Martin Alonzo  Pinzon, with his brother, Vincente Yanez Pinzon--both navigators of  great courage and ability, and owners of vessels--undertook to sail on  the expedition, and furnish one of the caravels required.  Two others  were pressed by the magistrates under the arbitrary mandate of the  sovereigns.    The owners of one of the vessels, the _Pinta_, threw all possible  obstacles in the way of her being fitted out.  The caulkers performed  their work in an imperfect manner, and even some of the seamen who had  at first volunteered repented of their hardihood, and others deserted.    The example of the Pinzons at length overcame all opposition, and the  three vessels, two of them known as caravels, not superior to the  coasting craft of more modern days, were got ready by the beginning of  August.    Columbus hoisted his flag on board the largest, the _Santa Maria_; the  second, the _Pinta_, was commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon, accompanied  by his brother Francisco Martin as pilot; and the third, the _Nina_, was  commanded by Vincente Yafiez Pinzon.  The other three pilots were Sancho  Raiz, Pedro Alonzo Nino, and Bartolomeo Roldan.    Roderigo Sanches was inspector-general of the armament, and Diego de  Arana chief alguazil.  Roderigo de Escobar went as royal notary.  In  all, one hundred and twenty persons.    Columbus and his followers, having solemnly taken the communion, went on  board their ships.  Believing that their friends were going to certain  death, the inhabitants of Paios looked on with gloomy apprehensions,  which greatly affected the minds of the crew.    The little squadron set sail from Palos half an hour before sunrise on  the 3rd of August, 1492, and steered a course for the Canary Islands.  Columbus had prepared a chart by which to sail.  On this he drew the  coasts of Europe and Africa, from the south of Ireland to the end of  Guinea, and opposite to them, on the other side of the Atlantic, the  extremity of Asia, or rather India, as it was then called.  Between them  he placed the island of Cipango or Japan, which, according to Marco  Polo, lay one thousand five hundred miles from the Atlantic coast.  This  island Columbus placed where Florida really exists.  Though he saw his  hopes of commencing the expedition realised, he had good reason to fear  that his crews might at any moment insist on returning.    On the third day after sailing, it was discovered that the rudder of the  _Pinta_ was broken and unslung, probably a trick of her owners.  The  wind was blowing so strongly at the time that he could not render  assistance, but Martin Alonzo Pinzon, being an able seaman, succeeded in  securing it temporarily with ropes.    As the _Pinta_ also leaked, Columbus put into the Canaries on the  morning of the 9th of August, and was detained there three weeks, trying  to obtain a better vessel.  None being found, the lateen sails of the  _Pinta_ were altered into square sails.  While here the crews were  frightened by seeing flames burst out of the lofty peak of Teneriffe.  Shortly after a vessel arrived from Ferro, which reported that three  Portuguese caravels were watching to capture the squadron of Columbus,  who, suspecting that the King of Portugal had formed a hostile plan in  revenge for his having embarked in the service of Spain, immediately put  to sea and stood away from the coast.  He was now striking off from the  frontier islands of the Old World into the region of discovery.  For  three days the squadron was detained by a calm.  On the 9th of September  he saw Ferro, the most western of the Canary Islands, where the  Portuguese were said to be waiting for him, about nine leagues distant.  At length, a breeze filling the sails of his ships, he was able to stand  on his course, as he hoped, free of all danger.  Chaos, mystery, and  peril were before them.  The hearts of his crew sank as they lost sight  of land, and many of the seamen broke into loud lamentations.  The  Admiral tried to soothe their distress, and to inspire them with his own  glorious anticipations by describing to them the magnificence of the  countries to which he was about to conduct them, and the wealth and  glory which would be theirs.    He now issued orders to the commanders of the other vessels that, in the"]]]
