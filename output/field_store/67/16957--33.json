[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#3)"],[1," a  loose box.    Into this fine box the groom put me; it was clean, sweet, and airy. I  never was in a better box than that, and the sides were not so high but  that I could see all that went on through the iron rails that were at  the top.    He gave me some very nice oats, he patted me, spoke kindly, and then  went away.    When I had eaten my corn I looked round. In the stall next to mine stood  a little fat gray pony, with a thick mane and tail, a very pretty head,  and a pert little nose.    I put my head up to the iron rails at the top of my box, and said, \"How  do you do? What is your name?\"    He turned round as far as his halter would allow, held up his head,  and said, \"My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome; I carry the young  ladies on my back, and sometimes I take our mistress out in the low  chair. They think a great deal of me, and so does James. Are you going  to live next door to me in the box?\"    I said, \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then,\" he said, \"I hope you are good-tempered; I do not like any  one next door who bites.\"    Just then a horse's head looked over from the stall beyond; the ears  were laid back, and the eye looked rather ill-tempered. This was a tall  chestnut mare, with a long handsome neck. She looked across to me and  said:    \"So it is you who have turned me out of my box; it is a very strange  thing for a colt like you to come and turn a lady out of her own home.\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" I said, \"I have turned no one out; the man who  brought me put me here, and I had nothing to do with it; and as to my  being a colt, I am turned four years old and am a grown-up horse. I  never had words yet with horse or mare, and it is my wish to live at  peace.\"    \"Well,\" she said, \"we shall see. Of course, I do not want to have words  with a young thing like you.\" I said no more.    In the afternoon, when she went out, Merrylegs told me all about it.    \"The thing is this,\" said Merrylegs. \"Ginger has a bad habit of biting  and snapping; that is why they call her Ginger, and when she was in the  loose box she used to snap very much. One day she bit James in the arm  and made it bleed, and so Miss Flora and Miss Jessie, who are very fond  of me, were afraid to come into the stable. They used to bring me nice  things to eat, an apple or a carrot, or a piece of bread, but after  Ginger stood in that box they dared not come, and I missed them very  much. I hope they will now come again, if you do not bite or snap.\"    I told him I never bit anything but grass, hay, and corn, and could not  think what pleasure Ginger found it.    \"Well, I don't think she does find pleasure,\" says Merrylegs; \"it is  just a bad habit; she says no one was ever kind to her, and why should  she not bite? Of course, it is a very bad habit; but I am sure, if all  she says be true, she must have been very ill-used before she came here.  John does all he can to please her, and James does all he can, and our  master never uses a whip if a horse acts right; so I think she might be  good-tempered here. You see,\" he said, with a wise look, \"I am twelve  years old; I know a great deal, and I can tell you there is not a better  place for a horse all round the country than this. John is the best  groom that ever was; he has been here fourteen years; and you never saw  such a kind boy as James is; so that it is all Ginger's own fault that  she did not stay in that box.\"          05 A Fair Start      The name of the coachman was John Manly; he had a wife and one little  child, and they lived in the coachman's cottage, very near the stables.    The next morning he took me into the yard and gave me a good grooming,  and just as I was going into my box, with my coat soft and bright, the  squire came in to look at me, and seemed pleased. \"John,\" he said,  \"I meant to have tried the new horse this morning, but I have other  business. You may as well take him around after breakfast; go by the  common and the Highwood, and back by the watermill and the river; that  will show his paces.\"    \"I will, sir,\" said John. After breakfast he came and fitted me with a  bridle. He was very particular in letting out and taking in the straps,  to fit my head comfortably; then he brought a saddle, but it was not  broad enough for my back; he saw it in a minute and went for another,  which fitted nicely. He rode me first slowly, then a trot, then a  canter, and when we were on the common he gave me a light touch with his  whip, and we had a splendid gallop.    \"Ho, ho! my boy,\" he said, as he pulled me up, \"you would like to follow  the hounds, I think.\"    As we came back through the park we met the Squire and Mrs. Gordon  walking; they stopped, and John jumped off.    \"Well, John, how does he go?\"    \"First-rate, sir,\" answered John; \"he is as fleet as a deer, and has a  fine spirit too; but the lightest touch of the rein will guide him. Down  at the end of the common we met one of those traveling carts hung all  over with baskets, rugs, and such like; you know, sir, many horses will  not pass those carts quietly; he just took a good look at it, and then  went on as quiet and pleasant as could be. They were shooting rabbits  near the Highwood, and a gun went off close by; he pulled up a little  and looked, but did not stir a step to right or left. I just held the  rein steady and did not hurry him, and it's my opinion he has not been  frightened or ill-used while he was young.\"    \"That's well,\" said the squire, \"I will try him myself to-morrow.\"    The next day I was brought up for my master. I remembered my mother's  counsel and my good old master's, and I tried to do exactly what he  wanted me to do. I found he was a very good rider, and thoughtful for  his horse too. When he came home the lady was at the hall door as he  rode up.    \"Well, my dear,\" she said, \"how do you like him?\"    \"He is exactly what John said,\" he replied; \"a pleasanter creature I  never wish to mount. What shall we call him?\"    \"Would you like Ebony?\" said she; \"he is as black as ebony.\"    \"No, not Ebony.\"    \"Will you call him Blackbird, like your uncle's old horse?\"    \"No, he is far handsomer than old Blackbird ever was.\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"he is really quite a beauty, and he has such a sweet,  good-tempered face, and such a fine, intelligent eye--what do you say to  calling him Black Beauty?\"    \"Black Beauty--why, yes, I think that is a very good name. If you like  it shall be his name;\" and so it was.    When John went into the stable he told James that master and mistress  had chosen a good, sensible English name for me, that meant something;  not like Marengo, or Pegasus, or Abdallah. They both laughed, and James  said, \"If it was not for bringing back the past, I should have named him  Rob Roy, for I never saw two horses more alike.\"    \"That's no wonder,\" said John; \"didn't you know that Farmer Grey's old  Duchess was the mother of them both?\"    I had never heard that before; and so poor Rob Roy who was killed  at that hunt was my brother! I did not wonder that my mother was so  troubled. It seems that horses have no relations; at least they never  know each other after they are sold.    John seemed very proud of me; he used to make my mane and tail almost as  smooth as a lady's hair, and he would talk to me a great deal; of course  I did not understand all he said, but I learned more and more to know  what he meant, and what he wanted me to do. I grew very fond of him, he  was so gentle and kind; he seemed to know just how a horse feels, and  when he cleaned me he knew the tender places and the ticklish places;  when he brushed my head he went as carefully over my eyes as if they  were his own, and never stirred up any ill-temper.    James Howard, the stable boy, was just as gentle and pleasant in his  way, so I thought myself well off. There was another man who helped in  the yard, but he had very little to do with Ginger and me.    A few days after this I had to go out with Ginger in the carriage. I  wondered how we should get on together; but except laying her ears  back when I was led up to her, she behaved very well. She did her work  honestly, and did her full share, and I never wish to have a better  partner in double harness. When we came to a hill, instead of slackening  her pace, she would throw her weight right into the collar, and pull  away straight up. We had both the same sort of courage at our work, and  John had oftener to hold us in than to urge us forward; he never had to  use the whip with either of us; then our paces were much the same, and  I found it very easy to keep step with her when trotting, which made it  pleasant, and master always liked it when we kept step well, and so did  John. After we had been out two or three times together we grew quite  friendly and sociable, which made me feel very much at home.    As for Merrylegs, he and I soon became great friends; he was such a  cheerful, plucky, good-tempered little fellow that he was a favorite  with every one, and especially with Miss Jessie and Flora, who used to  ride him about in the orchard, and have fine games with him and their  little dog Frisky.    Our master had two other horses that stood in another stable. One was  Justice, a roan cob, used for riding or for the luggage cart; the other  was an old brown hunter, named Sir Oliver; he was past work now, but was  a great favorite with the master, who gave him the run of the park; he  sometimes did a little light carting on the estate, or carried one of  the young ladies when they rode out with their father, for he was very  gentle and could be trusted with a child as well as Merrylegs. The cob  was a strong, well-made, good-tempered horse, and we sometimes had a  little chat in the paddock, but of course I could not be so intimate  with him as with Ginger, who stood in the same stable.          06 Liberty      I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I  missed it must not be thought I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#3)"],[1,"by exclaiming, \"Hum! hum!\"  But D'Artagnan did not stir. Planchet then saw that it was necessary  to have recourse to more effectual means still: after a prolonged  reflection on the subject, the most ingenious means that suggested  itself to him under the present circumstances, was to let himself roll  off the sack on to the floor, murmuring, at the same time, against  himself, the word \"stupid.\" But, notwithstanding the noise produced  by Planchet's fall, D'Artagnan, who had in the course of his existence  heard many other, and very different falls, did not appear to pay the  least attention to the present one. Besides, an enormous cart, laden  with stones, passing from the Rue Saint-Mederic, absorbed, in the noise  of its wheels, the noise of Planchet's tumble. And yet Planchet fancied  that, in token of tacit approval, he saw him imperceptibly smile at the  word \"stupid.\" This emboldened him to say, \"Are you asleep, Monsieur  d'Artagnan?\"    \"No, Planchet, I am not _even_ asleep,\" replied the musketeer.    \"I am in despair,\" said Planchet, \"to hear such a word as _even_.\"    \"Well, and why not; is it not a grammatical word, Monsieur Planchet?\"    \"Of course, Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"    \"Well!\"    \"Well, then, the word distresses me beyond measure.\"    \"Tell me why you are distressed, Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"If you say that you are not _even_ asleep, it is as much as to say that  you have not even the consolation of being able to sleep; or, better  still, it is precisely the same as telling me that you are getting bored  to death.\"    \"Planchet, you know that I am never bored.\"    \"Except to-day, and the day before yesterday.\"    \"Bah!\"    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan, it is a week since you returned here from  Fontainebleau; in other words, you have no longer your orders to issue,  or your men to review and maneuver. You need the sound of guns, drums,  and all that din and confusion; I, who have myself carried a musket, can  easily believe that.\"    \"Planchet,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"I assure you I am not bored in the  least in the world.\"    \"In that case, what are you doing, lying there, as if you were dead?\"    \"My dear Planchet, there was, once upon a time, at the siege of La  Rochelle, when I was there, when you were there, when we both were  there, a certain Arab, who was celebrated for the manner in which he  adjusted culverins. He was a clever fellow, although of a very odd  complexion, which was the same color as your olives. Well, this Arab,  whenever he had done eating or working, used to sit down to rest  himself, as I am resting myself now, and smoked I cannot tell you  what sort of magical leaves, in a large amber-mouthed tube; and if any  officers, happening to pass, reproached him for being always asleep, he  used quietly to reply: 'Better to sit down than to stand up, to lie  down than to sit down, to be dead than to lie down.' He was an acutely  melancholy Arab, and I remember him perfectly well, form the color of  his skin, and the style of his conversation. He used to cut off the  heads of Protestants with the most singular gusto!\"    \"Precisely; and then used to embalm them, when they were worth the  trouble; and when he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about  him, he looked like a basket-maker making baskets.\"    \"You are quite right, Planchet, he did.\"    \"Oh! I can remember things very well, at times!\"    \"I have no doubt of it; but what do you think of his mode of reasoning?\"    \"I think it good in one sense, but very stupid in another.\"    \"Expound your meaning, M. Planchet.\"    \"Well, monsieur, in point of fact, then, 'better to sit down than to  stand up,' is plain enough, especially when one may be fatigued,\" and  Planchet smiled in a roguish way; \"as for 'better to be lying down,'  let that pass, but as for the last proposition, that it is 'better to  be dead than alive,' it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own undoubted  preference being for my bed; and if you are not of my opinion, it is  simply, as I have already had the honor of telling you, because you are  boring yourself to death.\"    \"Planchet, do you know M. La Fontaine?\"    \"The chemist at the corner of the Rue Saint-Mederic?\"    \"No, the writer of fables.\"    \"Oh! _Maitre Corbeau!_\"    \"Exactly; well, then, I am like his hare.\"    \"He has got a hare also, then?\"    \"He has all sorts of animals.\"    \"Well, what does his hare do, then?\"    \"M. La Fontaine's hare thinks.\"    \"Ah, ah!\"    \"Planchet, I am like that hare--I am thinking.\"    \"You are thinking, you say?\" said Planchet, uneasily.    \"Yes; your house is dull enough to drive people to think; you will admit  that, I hope.\"    \"And yet, monsieur, you have a look-out upon the street.\"    \"Yes; and wonderfully interesting that is, of course.\"    \"But it is no less true, monsieur, that, if you were living at the back  of the house, you would bore yourself--I mean, you would think--more  than ever.\"    \"Upon my word, Planchet, I hardly know that.\"    \"Still,\" said the grocer, \"if your reflections are at all like those  which led you to restore King Charles II.--\" and Planchet finished by a  little laugh which was not without its meaning.    \"Ah! Planchet, my friend,\" returned D'Artagnan, \"you are getting  ambitious.\"    \"Is there no other king to be restored, M. d'Artagnan--no second Monk to  be packed up, like a salted hog, in a deal box?\"    \"No, my dear Planchet; all the kings are seated on their respective  thrones; less comfortably so, perhaps, than I am upon this chair; but,  at all events, there they are.\" And D'Artagnan sighed deeply.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said Planchet, \"you are making me very uneasy.\"    \"You are very good, Planchet.\"    \"I begin to suspect something.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan, you are getting thin.\"    \"Oh!\" said D'Artagnan, striking his chest which sounded like an empty  cuirass, \"it is impossible, Planchet.\"    \"Ah!\" said Planchet, slightly overcome; \"if you were to get thin in my  house--\"    \"Well?\"    \"I should do something rash.\"    \"What would you do? Tell me.\"    \"I should look out for the man who was the cause of all your anxieties.\"    \"Ah! according to your account, I am anxious now.\"    \"Yes, you are anxious; and you are getting thin, visibly getting thin.  _Malaga!_ if you go on getting thin, in this way, I will take my sword  in my hand, and go straight to M. d'Herblay, and have it out with him.\"    \"What!\" said M. d'Artagnan, starting in his chair; \"what's that you say?  And what has M. d'Herblay's name to do with your groceries?\"    \"Just as you please. Get angry if you like, or call me names, if you  prefer it; but, the deuce is in it. _I know what I know_.\"    D'Artagnan had, during this second outburst of Planchet's, so placed  himself as not to lose a single look of his face; that is, he sat with  both his hands resting on both his knees, and his head stretched out  towards the grocer. \"Come, explain yourself,\" he said, \"and tell me  how you could possibly utter such a blasphemy. M. d'Herblay, your old  master, my friend, an ecclesiastic, a musketeer turned bishop--do you  mean to say you would raise your sword against him, Planchet?\"    \"I could raise my sword against my own father, when I see you in such a  state as you are now.\"    \"M. d'Herblay, a gentleman!\"    \"It's all the same to me whether he's a gentleman or not. He gives you  the blue devils, that is all I know. And the blue devils make people  get thin. _Malaga!_ I have no notion of M. d'Artagnan leaving my house  thinner than when he entered it.\"    \"How does he give me the blue devils, as you call it? Come, explain,  explain.\"    \"You have had the nightmare during the last three nights.\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes, you; and in your nightmare you called out, several times, 'Aramis,  deceitful Aramis!'\"    \"Ah! I said that, did I?\" murmured D'Artagnan, uneasily.    \"Yes, those very words, upon my honor.\"    \"Well, what else? You know the saying, Planchet, 'dreams go by  contraries.'\"    \"Not so; for every time, during the last three days, when you went out,  you have not once failed to ask me, on your return, 'Have you seen  M. d'Herblay?' or else 'Have you received any letters for me from M.  d'Herblay?'\"    \"Well, it is very natural I should take an interest in my old friend,\"  said D'Artagnan.    \"Of course; but not to such an extent as to get thin on that account.\"    \"Planchet, I'll get fatter; I give you my word of honor I will.\"    \"Very well, monsieur, I accept it; for I know that when you give your  word of honor, it is sacred.\"    \"I will not dream of Aramis any more; and I will never ask you again  if there are any letters from M. d'Herblay; but on condition that you  explain one thing to me.\"    \"Tell me what it is, monsieur?\"    \"I am a great observer; and just now you made use of a very singular  oath, which is unusual for you.\"    \"You mean _Malaga!_ I suppose?\"    \"Precisely.\"    \"It is the oath I have used ever since I have been a grocer.\"    \"Very proper, too; it is the name of a dried grape, or raisin, I  believe?\"    \"It is my most ferocious oath; when I have once said _Malaga!_ I am a  man no longer.\"    \"Still, I never knew you use that oath before.\"    \"Very likely not, monsieur. I had a present made me of it,\" said  Planchet; and, as he pronounced these words, he winked his eye with a  cunning expression, which thoroughly awakened D'Artagnan's attention.    \"Come, come, M. Planchet.\"    \"Why, I am not like you, monsieur,\" said Planchet. \"I don't pass my life  in thinking.\"    \"You do wrong, then.\"    \"I mean in boring myself to death. We have but a very short time to  live--why not make the best of it?\"    \"You are an Epicurean philosopher, I begin to think, Planchet.\"    \"Why not? My hand is still as steady as ever; I can write, and can weigh  out my sugar and spices; my foot is firm; I can dance and walk about; my  stomach has its teeth still, for I eat and digest very well; my heart is  not quite hardened."]]]
