Gunnlaug says, \"This is my whole mind, and no vain words.\"    Thorstein says, \"Thou shouldst first know thine own will. Art thou not  bound to fare abroad? and yet thou makest as if thou wouldst go marry.  Neither art thou an even match for Helga while thou art so unsettled,  and therefore this cannot so much as be looked at.\"    Gunnlaug says, \"Where lookest thou for a match for thy daughter, if  thou wilt not give her to the son of Illugi the Black; or who are they  throughout Burg-firth who are of more note than he?\"    Thorstein answered: \"I will not play at men-mating,\" says he, \"but if  thou wert such a man as he is, thou wouldst not be turned away.\"    Gunnlaug said, \"To whom wilt thou give thy daughter rather than to me?\"    Said Thorstein, \"Hereabout are many good men to choose from. Thorfin of  Red-Mel hath seven sons, and all of them men of good manners.\"    Gunnlaug answers, \"Neither Onund nor Thorfin are men as good as my  father. Nay, thou thyself clearly fallest short of him--or what hast  thou to set against his strife with Thorgrim the Priest, the son of  Kiallak, and his sons, at Thorsness Thing, where he carried all that was  in debate?\"    Thorstein answers, \"I drave away Steinar, the son of Onund Sioni, which  was deemed somewhat of a deed.\"    Gunnlaug says, \"Therein thou wast holpen by thy father Egil; and, to end  all, it is for few bonders to cast away my alliance.\"    Said Thorstein, \"Carry thy cowing away to the fellows up yonder at the  mountains; for down here, on the Meres, it shall avail thee nought.\"    Now in the evening they come home; but next morning Gunnlaug rode up to  Gilsbank, and prayed his father to ride with him a-wooing out to Burg.    Illugi answered, \"Thou art an unsettled man, being bound for faring  abroad, but makest now as if thou wouldst busy thyself with wife-wooing;  and so much do I know, that this is not to Thorstein's mind.\"    Gunnlaug answers, \"I shall go abroad all the same, nor shall I be well  pleased but if thou further this.\"    So after this Illugi rode with eleven men from home down to Burg,  and Thorstein greeted him well. Early in the morning Illugi said to  Thorstein, \"I would speak to thee.\"    \"Let us go, then, to the top of the Burg, and talk together there,\" says  Thorstein; and so they did, and Gunnlaug went with them.    Then said Illugi, \"My kinsman Gunnlaug tells me that he has begun a  talk with thee on his own behalf, praying that he might woo thy daughter  Helga; but now I would fain know what is like to come of this matter.  His kin is known to thee, and our possessions; from my hand shall be  spared neither land nor rule over men, if such things might perchance  further matters.\"    Thorstein said, \"Herein alone Gunnlaug pleases me not, that I find him  an unsettled man; but if he were of a mind like thine, little would I  hang back.\"    Illugi said, \"It will cut our friendship across if thou gainsayest me  and my son an equal match.\"    Thorstein answers, \"For thy words and our friendship then, Helga shall  be vowed, but not betrothed, to Gunnlaug, and shall bide for him three  winters: but Gunnlaug shall go abroad and shape himself to the ways of  good men; but I shall be free from all these matters if he does not then  come back, or if his ways are not to my liking.\"    Thereat they parted; Illugi rode home, but Gunnlaug rode to his ship.  But when they had wind at will they sailed for the main, and made  the northern part of Norway, and sailed landward along Thrandheim to  Nidaros; there they rode in the harbour, and unshipped their goods.          CHAPTER VII.     Of Gunnlaug in the East and the West.    In those days Earl Eric, the son of Hakon, and his brother Svein, ruled  in Norway. Earl Eric abode as then at Hladir, which was left to him by  his father, and a mighty lord he was. Skuli, the son of Thorstein, was  with the earl at that time, and was one of his court, and well esteemed.    Now they say that Gunnlaug and Audun Festargram, and seven of them  together, went up to Hladir to the earl. Gunnlaug was so clad that he  had on a grey kirtle and white long-hose; he had a boil on his foot by  the instep, and from this oozed blood and matter as he strode on. In  this guise he went before the earl with Audun and the rest of them,  and greeted him well. The earl knew Audun, and asked him tidings from  Iceland. Audun told him what there was toward. Then the earl asked  Gunnlaug who he was, and Gunnlaug told him his name and kin. Then  the earl said: \"Skuli Thorstein's son, what manner of man is this in  Iceland?\"    \"Lord,\" says he, \"give him good welcome, for he is the son of the best  man in Iceland, Illugi the Black of Gilsbank, and my foster-brother  withal.\"    The earl asked, \"What ails thy foot, Icelander?\"    \"A boil, lord,\" said he.    \"And yet thou wentest not halt?\"    Gunnlaug answers, \"Why go halt while both legs are long alike?\"    Then said one of the earl's men, called Thorir: \"He swaggereth hugely,  this Icelander! It would not be amiss to try him a little.\"    Gunnlaug looked at him and sang:--              \"A courtman there is            Full evil I wis,            A bad man and black,            Belief let him lack.\"    Then would Thorir seize an axe. The earl spake: \"Let it be,\" says he;  \"to such things men should pay no heed. But now, Icelander, how old a  man art thou?\"    Gunnlaug answers: \"I am eighteen winters old as now,\" says he.    Then says Earl Eric, \"My spell is that thou shalt not live eighteen  winters more.\"    Gunnlaug said, somewhat under his breath: \"Pray not against me, but for  thyself rather.\"    The earl asked thereat, \"What didst thou say, Icelander?\"    Gunnlaug answers, \"What I thought well befitting, that thou shouldst bid  no prayers against me, but pray well for thyself rather.\"    \"What prayers, then?\" says the earl.    \"That thou mightest not meet thy death after the manner of Earl Hakon,  thy father.\"    The earl turned red as blood, and bade them take the rascal in haste;  but Skuli stepped up to the earl, and said: \"Do this for my words, lord,  and give this man peace, so that he depart at his swiftest.\"    The earl answered, \"At his swiftest let him be off then, if he will have  peace, and never let him come again within mv realm.\"    Then Skuli went out with Gunnlaug down to the bridges, where there was  an England-bound ship ready to put out; therein Skuli got for Gunnlaug  a berth, as well as for Thorkel, his kinsman; but Gunnlaug gave his ship  into Audun's ward, and so much of his goods as he did not take with him.    Now sail Gunnlaug and his fellows into the English main, and come at  autumntide south to London Bridge, where they hauled ashore their ship.    Now at that time King Ethelred, the son of Edgar, ruled over England,  and was a good lord; this winter he sat in London. But in those days  there was the same tongue in England as in Norway and Denmark; but the  tongues changed when William the Bastard won England, for thenceforward  French went current there, for he was of French kin.    Gunnlaug went presently to the king, and greeted him well and worthily,  The king asked him from what land he came, and Gunnlaug told him all as  it was. \"But,\" said he, \"I have come to meet thee, lord, for that I have  made a song on thee, and I would that it might please thee to hearken to  that song.\" The king said it should be so, and Gunnlaug gave forth the  song well and proudly; and this is the burden thereof:--              \"As God are all folk fearing            The free lord King of England,            Kin of all kings and all folk,            To Ethelred the head tow.\"    The king thanked him for the song, and gave him as song-reward a scarlet  cloak lined with the costliest of furs, and golden-broidered down to the  hem; and made him his man; and Gunnlaug was with him all the winter, and  was well accounted of.    One day, in the morning early, Gunnlaug met three men in a certain  street, and Thororm was the name of their leader; he was big and strong,  and right evil to deal with. He said, \"Northman, lend me some money.\"    Gunnlaug answered, \"That were ill counselled to lend one's money to  unknown men.\"    He said, \"I will pay it thee back on a named day.\"    \"Then shall it be risked,\" says Gunnlaug; and he lent him the fee  withal.    But some time afterwards Gunnlaug met the king, and told him of the  money-lending. The king answered, \"Now hast thou thriven little, for  this is the greatest robber and reiver; deal with him in no wise, but I  will give thee money as much as thine was.\"    Gunnlaug said, \"Then do we, your men, do after a sorry sort, if,  treading sackless folk under foot, we let such fellows as this deal us  out our lot. Nay, that shall never be.\"    Soon after he met Thororm and claimed the fee of him. He said he was not  going to pay it.    Then sang Gunnlaug:--              \"Evil counselled art thou,            Gold from us withholding;            The reddener of the edges,            Pricking on with tricking.            Wot ye what? they called me,            Worm-tongue, yet a youngling;            Nor for nought so hight I;            Now is time to show it!\"    \"Now I will make an offer good in law,\" says Gunnlaug; \"that thou either  pay me my money, or else that thou go on holm with me in three nights'  space.\"    Then laughed the viking, and said, \"Before thee none have come to that,  to call me to holm, despite of all the ruin that many a man has had to  take at my hands. Well, I am ready to go.\"    Thereon they parted for that time.    Gunnlaug told the king what had befallen; and he said, \"Now, indeed,  have things taken a right hopeless turn; for this man's eyes can dull  any weapon. But thou shalt follow my rede; here is a sword I will  give thee--with that thou shalt fight, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#3)"],[1,"h--Origin of the Tithing System    VII.
