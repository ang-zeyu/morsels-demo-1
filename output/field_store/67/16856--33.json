Hence, in his work on Therapeutics he announced  himself as \"aiming at a systematic analysis of all current and approved  means of combating disease,\" selecting his formulae and therapeutical  directions from the most eminent living physicians of all nations.    This work was most favorably received by medical men; and, edited and  revised by competent hands, continues to be regarded as one of the most  valuable works in American medical literature. The unanimous opinion of  the leading medical journals, as well as of its numerous purchasers,  have testified to its real and great worth to the practitioner of  medicine.    Having thus established a wide, popular and professional reputation, one  which would have guaranteed him a lucrative practice, it would have  tempted another, no doubt, to make the most of this opportunity, so  rarely granted a young physician. Not so was it with Dr. Napheys. No  sooner had the three works mentioned been completed than he sailed for  Europe, in order to familiarize himself with the famed schools of  learning of the Old World and its rich stores of material for culture.  The summer was that of the Franco-German war; and spending most of it in  Paris, he was witness of several of the most exciting scenes which  attended the dethronement of the Emperor. These he would describe  afterwards with a vividness and power of language rarely excelled.    The excitement of the period did not, however, withdraw his attention  from the studies he had in view. These were partially indicated in a  series of letters he contributed to various periodicals during his  absence. While these letters were principally of a scientific character,  it is noteworthy how the relations of medicine to the welfare of man  always occupied his attention. Thus we find, in one sent from England,  June, 1870, a description of the Liverpool Medical Missionary Society,  a charity which combines religious instruction with medical advice; and  again, he comments on the popular instruction in hygiene which was  supplied at that period to the English workingmen by a committee of  competent physicians, organized for that purpose. It was the author's  purpose to collect and expand these letters into a volume, but the  project was not carried out.    The siege of Paris, which city he left in one of the last trains before  the blockade commenced, and the prolongation of the war, induced him to  return home. In the United States he found offers from several  publishers awaiting him, which would more than occupy him for a full  year. There was a new edition of his \"Therapeutics\" demanded, and a  revision of both \"The Physical Life of Woman\" and \"The Transmission of  Life.\" A New England firm urgently pressed him to superintend the  production of several hygienic works, and secured him as literary  adviser to their house. He assumed the editorship of the \"Half-Yearly  Compendium of Medical Science,\" and also of a \"Physician's Annual,\"  besides undertaking a number of articles for the periodical press, both  scientific and popular.    To this active literary life he devoted the year 1871; but at its close  felt more strongly than ever that he must give himself several years of  studious quiet, in order to accomplish his best. Refusing, therefore,  any further engagements, he sailed for Europe again, late in 1871, and  did not return this time until the spring of 1875. In this period, of  more than three years, he visited almost all the principal cities of  Europe, and enjoyed the friendship of many eminent men at London, St.  Petersburg, Vienna, and Paris. Reading, visiting hospitals, and  attending clinics, he accumulated a mass of material which he designed  to work up into future literary enterprises.    With these collected stores he returned to the United States early in  1875, and set to work with his wonted energy. A new and much enlarged  edition of the \"Therapeutics\" was sent to press; a \"Handbook of Popular  Medicine,\" designed to give, in simple language, the domestic treatment  of disease, the rules for nursing the sick, selected receipts for diet  and medicinal purposes, and the outlines of anatomy and physiology, was  put in the hands of a publisher; a Synopsis of Pharmacy and Materia  Medica, a work of enormous labor, was well under way; and other literary  projects were actively planned; when, suddenly, the summons came which,  in an instant, with the shears of fate, slit the strand of this  activity. The rest of the story may be told in the words of the  biographer appointed by the Medical Society of the County of  Philadelphia to prepare a memoir of his life:--    \"While earnestly laboring to prepare for the press his literary  collections, he suffered a severe blow by the sudden death of a person  to whom he was deeply attached. Over-work and this emotional shock  produced a result likely enough to occur in one of his ardent  temperament. One afternoon, while engaged in writing, he fell,  unconscious, from his chair, and for several days lay in a very critical  condition. On recovering his powers, it was evident his brain had  suffered a serious lesion. The old energy and love of labor had  completely gone; even the capacity for work seemed absent. Marked  melancholy followed, characterized before long by avoidance of friends  and the loss of a desire of life. This occurred with increasing force  until it led to his death, on July 1, 1876, through some toxic agent,  the nature of which was not ascertained.    \"Thus early, and thus sadly, terminated a career of unusual brilliancy  and promise.    \"It is probable that much that he has written will be read with pleasure  and instruction by future generations; and the memory of his genial  disposition, his entertaining conversation, and earnest sense of  professional honor, will long be cherished by those of his  contemporaries who enjoyed his friendship.\"--_Transactions of the  Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania_, vol. xi, p. 720.    Various tributes were paid to his memory by the societies with which he  was connected, and by the scientific journals to which he had been a  contributor. One of these, after narrating some of the circumstances  attending his decease, spoke as follows:--    \"Thus did our unfortunate associate close his short but brilliant  career. The emotions, the tender sentiments he has described with such a  magical pen, he felt himself with an unmatched keenness. They mastered  his whole frame with an intensity surpassing all romance. His  descriptions of the passions, descriptions which have been the wonder of  thousands, such is their fire and temper, were not rhetorical studies,  but the ebullition of a soul sensitive to their lightest breath, and not  shunning their wildest tempests.    \"The genius which dictated the lines he has left us is not to be judged  by the conventionalities which suit the cold temperaments of ordinary  men; there is a strong vein of egotism in most devotion; but here was  one who felt, 'all is lost, when love is lost.'\"    This extract well sets forth the extraordinary depth of his sentiments,  and the fervor of his feelings. It may be added that these mental traits  were not generally ascribed to him by casual or ordinary associates. He  was, in manners and bearing, evidently not one who sought friendships or  displayed to the general gaze the current of his thoughts. Consequently,  of intimates he had but few, and was considered by those whose  intercourse with him was superficial, to be much more of an intellectual  than of an emotional type of character.    This impression was doubtless increased by the strongly practical turn  of his mind, which is conspicuous in all his works. He was the reverse  of a dreamer and had little patience with theorists. In his professional  study he always aimed at bringing into the strongest light the  utilitarian aspect of medicine, its ameliorating power on humanity, its  real efficacy in preserving or restoring health and limiting human  misery. On this his theory of therapeutics was based, and, inspired by  the same opinions, he was one of the most earnest advocates of the day  of popularizing medical science in all its branches among the masses. In  this effort he was at times severely criticized by that class of  physicians--and they are by no means extinct--who think that medicine  should be wrapped in mystery, and that the people should be kept in  ignorance of themselves and of their own physical frailties, to the  utmost possible extent. With these learned obscurantists Dr. Napheys had  no patience, and naturally found but slight favor. Fortunately, they  were in the decided minority, and, we are happy to add, even that  minority is daily decreasing.    Of the various learned societies to which he was attached may be  mentioned the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the Franklin  Institute of Philadelphia, and the Gynecological Society of Boston. His  election as Corresponding Member to the latter body (which is an  association of scientific men who make an especial study of the hygiene  and diseases of women) took place shortly after the first publication of  the _Physical Life of Woman_, and was meant as a direct tribute of  respect to him as the author of that work, thus obtaining for it the  testimony of the highest body in that specialty then existing in our  land.    The general plan on which Dr. Napheys prepared his sanitary writings was  one eminently calculated to reconcile those who were most opposed to  instructing the general public in such branches. While he confidently  believed that vastly more harm than good is done by a prudish  concealment of the physiology of sex and its relations to health, he  also clearly recognized that such instruction should be imparted at the  proper age and under certain limitations; while the general facts common  to the species cannot be taught too generally, or made too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#3)"],[1,"to my mother that the book was very  \"indelicate\" and after that Beadle's \"Dime Novels\" were absolutely  forbidden. At school, we were told that any boy who read Beadle's was a  moral leper; but as most of us concluded that leper had something to do  with leaper, the effect was not very convincing.    Perhaps I might have been decoyed back to Beadle's, for all the  youngsters knew that there was nothing really wrong in them, but I  happened to remember the scene in Sir Walter Scott's \"Abbot,\" where  Edward Glendenning wades into the sea to prevent Mary Stuart from  leaving Scotland. I hied me to \"The Monastery\" and devoured everything  of Sir Walter's except \"Saint Ronan's Well.\" That never seemed worthy of  the great Sir Walter. \"The Black Dwarf\" and \"Anne of Geierstein\" were  rather tough reading, and \"Count Robert of Paris\" might have been  written by Lord Bacon, if Lord Bacon had been a contemporary of Sir  Walter's. \"Peveril of the Peak\" and \"Ivanhoe\" and \"Bride of Lammermoor\"  again and again dazzled and consoled me until I discovered \"Nicholas  Nickleby.\"    \"Nicholas Nickleby\" took entire possession of me. In the rainy winter  afternoons, when nothing could occur out of doors which a respectable  city boy was permitted to indulge in, I found that I was expected to  work. Boys worked hard at their lessons in those days. There was a  kitchen downstairs with a Dutch oven not used in the winter. There it  was easy to build a small fire and to toast bread and to read \"Nicholas  Nickleby\" after one had rushed through the required tasks, which  generally included ten pages of the \"Historia Sacra\" in Latin. If you  never read \"Nicholas Nickleby\" when you were young, you cannot possibly  know the flavour of Dickens. You can't laugh now as you laughed then.  Oh, the delight of Mr. Crummles's description of his wife's dignified  manner of standing with her head on a spear!    The tragedy in \"Nicholas Nickleby\" never appealed to me. It was  necessary to skip that. When the people were gentlemanly and ladylike,  they became great bores. But what young reader of Dickens can forget the  hostile attitude of Mr. Lillyvick, great-uncle of the little Miss  Kenwigses, when Nicholas attempted to teach them French? As one grows  older, even Mr. Squeers and 'Tilda give one less real delight; but think  of the first discovery of them, and it is like Balboa's--or was it  Cortez's?--discovery of the Pacific in Keats's sonnet. \"Nicholas  Nickleby\" was read over and over again, with unfailing pleasure. I found  \"Little Dorrit\" rather tiresome; \"Barnaby Rudge\" and \"A Tale of Two  Cities\" seemed to be rather serious reading, not quite Dickensish enough  for my taste, yet better than anything else that anybody had written. My  later impressions of Dickens modified these instinctive intuitions.    One day, a set of Thackeray arrived, little green volumes, as I  remember, and I began to read \"Vanity Fair.\" My mother seized it and  read it aloud again. Her confessor had told her that a dislike for good  novels was \"Puritan\" and she, shocked by the implied reproach, took  again to novel reading. I am afraid that I disliked Colonel Dobbin and  Amelia very much. Becky Sharp pleased me beyond words; I don't think  that the morality of the case affected my point of view at all. I was  delighted whenever Becky \"downed\" an enemy. They were such a lot of  stupid people--the enemies--and I reflected during the course of the  story that, after all, Thackeray had said that poor Becky had no mother  to guide her footsteps. When the Marquis of Steyne was hit on the  forehead with the diamonds, I thought it served him right; but I was  unhappy because poor Becky had lost the jewels. In finishing the book  with those lovely Thackerayan cadences, my mother said severely, \"That  is what always happens to bad people!\" But in my heart I did not believe  that Becky Sharp was a bad person at all.    For a time I returned to Dickens, to \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" to \"David  Copperfield.\" I respected Thackeray. He had gripped me in some way that  I could not explain. But Dickens I loved. Later--it was on one June  afternoon I think--when the news of Dickens's death arrived, it seemed  to me that for a while all delight in life had ended.    One of those experts in psychology who are always seeking questions  sometime ago wrote to me demanding if \"Plutarch's Lives\" had influenced  me, and whether I thought they were good reading for the young. Our  \"Plutarch\" was rather appalling to look at. It was bound in mottled  cardboard, and the pages had red edges; but I attacked it one day, when  I was about ten years of age, and became enthralled. It was \"actual.\" My  mother was a veteran politician, and read a daily paper, with Southern  tendencies called the _Age_; my father belonged to the opposite party,  and admired Senator Hoar as greatly as my mother admired the famous  Vallandigham. Between the two, I had formed a very poor opinion of  American statesmen in general; but the statesmen in \"Plutarch\" were of a  very different type.    Julius Caesar interested me; but Brutus filled me with exaltation. I had  not then read Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar.\" It seemed to me that Brutus  was a model for all time. Now, understand I was a good Christian child,  and I said my prayers every night and morning, but this did not prevent  me from hating the big bully of the school, who made the lives of the  ten or fifteen small boys a perpetual torment. How we suffered, no  adult human tongue can tell--and our tongues never told because it was a  convention that tales should not be told out of school. One of the  pleasant tricks of the bully and his friends was to chase the little  boys after school in the winter and bury them until they were almost  suffocated in the snow which was piled up in the narrow streets. It was  not only suffocating snow, but it was dirty snow. It happened that I had  been presented with a penknife consisting of two rather leaden blades  covered with a brilliant iridescent mother-of-pearl handle. The bully  wanted this knife, and I knew it. Generally, I left it at home; but it  occurred to me on one inspired morning, after I had read \"Plutarch\" the  night before, that I would display the knife open in my pocket, and when  he threw the full weight of his body upon me, I would kill him at once,  by an upward thrust of the knife.    This struck me as a good deed entirely worthy of Brutus. Of course, I  knew that I should be hanged, but then I expected the glory of making a  last dying speech, and, besides, the school would have a holiday. On the  morning preceding the great sacrifice, I gave out dark hints to the  small boys, distributed my various belongings to friends who were about  to be bereaved, and predicted a coming holiday. I was looked on as  rather \"crazy,\" but I reflected that I would soon be considered heroic,  and my friends gladly accepted the gifts.    The fatal afternoon came. I displayed the penknife. The chase began. The  bully and his chosen friends threw themselves upon me. The moment had  come; I thrust the knife upward; the big boy uttered a howl, and ran,  still howling. I looked for blood, but there was none visible; I came to  the conclusion, with satisfaction, that he was bleeding internally. I  spent a gloomy evening at home uttering dire predictions which were  incomprehensible to the members of my family, and reread Brutus, in the  \"Lives.\"    The next morning I went to school with lessons unstudied and awaited  events. The mother of the bully appeared, and entered into an excited  colloquy with the very placid and dignified teacher. I announced to the  boy next to me, \"My time has come.\" I was called up to the awful desk.  \"Is he dead?\" I asked. \"Did he bleed internally?\" \"You little wretch,\"  the mother of the tyrant said, \"you cut such fearful holes in my son's  coat, that he is afraid to come to school to-day!\" Then I said,  regretfully, \"Oh, I hoped that I had killed him.\" There was a sensation;  my character was blackened. I was set down as a victim of total  depravity; I endured it all, but I knew in my heart that it was  \"Plutarch.\" This is the effect that \"Plutarch\" had on the mind of a good  Christian child.    The effects of \"Plutarch\" on my character were never discovered at home,  and as I grew older and learned one or two wrestling tricks, the bully  let me alone. Besides, my murderous intention, which had leaked out,  gave me such a reputation that I became a dictator myself, and made  terms for the small boys, in the name of freedom, which were sometimes  rather despotic.    It was also during these days that I remember carrying confusion into  the family when a patronizing, intellectual lady called and said, \"I  hope that this dear little boy is reading the Rollo books?\" \"No,\" I  answered quickly and indiscreetly, \"I am reading 'The New Magdalen,' by  Wilkie Collins.\" I did not think much of Wilkie Collins until I read  \"The Moonstone.\" It seemed that \"The New Magdalen\" had been purchased  inadvertently by my father, in a packet of \"classics.\"    My father generally arrived at home late in the afternoon, when he read  the evening paper. After a very high tea, he stretched himself on a long  horsehair-covered sofa, and bade me read to him, generally from the  novels of George Eliot, or from certain romances running through the New  York _Ledger_ by Sylvanus Cobb, Jr. These were generally stories of the  times of the Irish Kings, in which gallowglasses and lovely and  aristocratic Celtic maidens disported themselves. My mother, after her  conversion, disapproved of the New York _Ledger_. In fact, there were  families in Philadelphia whose heads regarded it with real horror! In  our house, there was a large stack of this interesting periodical,  which, with many volumes of Godey's _Lady's Book_, were packed in the  attic.    It happened that a young man, in whom my father had a great interest,  was"]]]
