I can never  forget, also, his shoes, with their silver buckles, his white stockings,  his brown coat, which always looked new, and yet seemed to be old, and  his cane, which was the same I had seen standing by my bedside in  childhood, when he felt my pulse and prescribed my medicines.  I had  often been sick, but it was always faith in this man which made me well  again.  I never had the slightest doubt of his ability to cure me, and  when my mother said she must send for the Hofrath that I might get well  again, it was as if she had said she must send for the tailor to mend my  torn trousers.  I had only to take the medicine, and I felt that I must  be well again.    \"How are you, my child?\" said he, as he entered the room.  \"You are not  looking perfectly well.  You must not study too much.  But I have little  time to-day to talk, and only came to tell you, you must not go to see  the Countess Marie again.  I have been with her all night, and it is your  fault.  So be careful, if her life is dear to you, that you do not go  again.  She must leave here as soon as possible, and be taken into the  country.  It would be best for you also to travel for a long time.  So  good morning, and be a good child.\"    With these words, he gave me his hand, looked at me affectionately in the  eyes, as if he would exact the promise, and then went on his way to look  after his sick children.    I was so astonished that another had penetrated so deeply into the  secrets of my soul, and that he knew what I did not know myself, that  when I recovered from it he had already been long upon the street.  An  agitation began to seize me, as water, which has long been over the fire  without stirring, suddenly bubbles up, boils, heaves and rages until it  overflows.    Not see her again!  I only live when I am with her.  I will be calm; I  will not speak a word to her; I will only stand at her window as she  sleeps and dreams.  But not to see her again!  Not to take one farewell  from her!  She knows not, they cannot know, that I love her.  Surely I do  not love her--I desire nothing, I hope for nothing, my heart never beats  more quietly then when I am with her.  But I must feel her presence--I  must breathe her spirit--I must go to her!  She waits for me.  Has  destiny thrown us together without design?  Ought I not to be her  consolation, and ought she not to be my repose?  Life is not a sport.  It  does not force two souls together like the grains of sand in the desert,  which the sirocco whirls together and then asunder.  We should hold fast  the souls which friendly fate leads to us, for they are destined for us,  and no power can tear them from us if we have the courage to live, to  struggle, and to die for them.  She would despise me if I deserted her  love at the first roll of the thunder, as it were in the shadow of a  tree, under which I have dreamed so many happy hours.    Then I suddenly grew calm, and heard only the words \"her love;\" they  reverberated through all the recesses of my soul like an echo, and I was  terrified at myself.  \"Her love,\" and how had I deserved it?  She hardly  knows me, and even if she could love me, must I not confess to her I do  not deserve the love of an angel?  Every thought, every hope which arose  in my soul, fell back like a bird which essays to soar into the blue sky  and does not see the wires which restrain it.  And yet, why all this  blissfulness, so near and so unattainable?  Cannot God work wonders?  Does He not work wonders every morning?  Has He not often heard my prayer  when it importuned him, and would not cease, until consolation and help  came to the weary one?  These are not earthly blessings for which we  pray.  It is only that two souls, which have found and recognized each  other, may be allowed to finish their brief life-journey, arm in arm, and  face to face; that I may be a support to her in suffering, and that she  may be a consolation and precious burden to me until we reach the end.  And if a still later spring were promised to her life, if her burdens  were taken from her--Oh, what blissful scenes crowded upon my vision!  The castle of her deceased mother, in the Tyrol, belonged to her.  There,  on the green mountains, in the fresh mountain air, among a sturdy and  uncorrupted people, far away from the hurly-burly of the world, its cares  and its struggles, its opinion and its censure, how blissfully we could  await the close of life, and silently fade away like the evening-red!  Then I pictured the dark lake, with the dancing shimmer of waves, and the  clear shadows of distant glaciers reflected in it; I heard the lowing of  cattle and the songs of the herdsmen; I saw the hunters with their rifles  crossing the mountains, and the old and young gathering together at  twilight in the village; and, to crown all, I saw her passing along like  an angel of peace in benediction, and I was her guide and friend.  \"Poor  fool!\" I cried out, \"poor fool!  Is thy heart always to be so wild and so  weak?  Be a man.  Think who thou art, and how far thou art from her.  She  is a friend.  She gladly reflects herself in another's soul, but her  childlike trust and candor at best only show that no deeper feeling lives  in her breast for thee.  Hast thou not, on many a clear summer's night,  wandering alone, through the beech groves, seen how the moon sheds its  light upon all the branches and leaves, how it brightens the dark, dull  water of the pool and reflects itself clearly in the smallest drops?  In  like manner she shines upon this dark life, and thou may'st feel her  gentle radiance reflected in thy heart--but hope not for a warmer glow!\"    Suddenly an image approached me as it were from life; she stood before  me, not like a memory but as a vision, and I realized for the first time  how beautiful she was.  It was not that beauty of form and face which  dazzles us at the first sight of a lovely maiden, and then fades away as  suddenly as a blossom in spring.  It was much more the harmony of her  whole being, the reality of every emotion, the spirituality of  expression, the perfect union of body and soul which blesses him so who  looks upon it.  The beauty which nature lavishes so prodigally does not  bring any satisfaction, if the person is not adapted to it and as it were  deserves and overcomes it.  On the other hand, it is offensive, as when  we look upon an actress striding along the stage in queenly costume, and  notice at every step how poorly the attire fits her, how little it  becomes her.  True beauty is sweetness, and sweetness is the  spiritualizing of the gross, the corporeal and the earthly.  It is the  spiritual presence which transforms ugliness into beauty.  The more I  looked upon the vision which stood before me, the more I perceived, above  all else, the majestic beauty of her person and the soulful depths of her  whole being.  Oh, what happiness was near me!  And was this all--to be  shown the summit of earthly bliss and then be thrust out into the flat,  sandy wastes of existence?  Oh, that I had never known what treasures the  earth conceals!  Once to love, and then to be forever alone!  Once to  believe, and then forever to doubt!  Once to see the light, and then  forever to be blinded!  In comparison with this rack, all the  torture-chambers of man are insignificant.    Thus rushed the wild chase of my thoughts farther and farther away until  at last all was silent.  The confused sensations gradually collected and  settled.  This repose and exhaustion they call meditation, but it is  rather an inspection--one allows time for the mixture of thoughts to  crystallize themselves according to eternal laws, and regards the process  like an observing chemist; and the elements having assumed a form, we  often wonder that they, as well as ourselves, are so entirely different  from what we expected.    When I awoke from my abstraction, my first words were, \"I must away.\"  I  immediately sat down and wrote the Hofrath that I should travel for  fourteen days and submit entirely to him.  I easily made an excuse to my  parents, and at night I was on my way to the Tyrol.          SEVENTH MEMORY.    Wandering, arm in arm with a friend, through the valleys and over the  mountains of the Tyrol, one sips life's fresh air and enjoyment; but to  travel the same road solitary and alone with your thoughts is time and  trouble lost.  Of what interest to me are the green mountains, the dark  ravines, the blue lake, and the mighty cataracts?  Instead of  contemplating them they look at me and wonder among themselves at this  solitary being.  It smote me to the heart that I had found no one in  all the world who loved me more than all others.  With such thoughts I  awoke every morning, and they haunted me all the day like a song which  one cannot drive away.  When I entered the inn at night and sat down  wearied, and the people in the room watched me, and wondered at the  solitary wanderer, it often urged me out into the night again, where no  one could see I was alone.  At a late hour I would steal back, go  quietly up to my room and throw myself upon my hot bed, and the song of  Schubert's would ring through my soul until I went to sleep: \"Where  thou art not, is happiness.\"  At last the sight of men, whom I  continually met laughing, rejoicing and exulting in this glorious  nature, became so intolerable that I slept by day, and pursued my  journey from place to place in the clear moonlight nights.  There was  at least one emotion which dispelled and dissipated my thoughts: it was  fear.  Let any one attempt to scale mountains alone all night long in  ignorance of the way--where the eye, unnaturally strained, beholds  distant shapes it cannot solve--where the ear, with morbid acuteness,  hears sounds without knowing whence they come--where the foot suddenly  stumbles, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#8)"],[1,"later he is a man who has looked upon  the sorrows of men. His old boy-world is far behind him, and the  ever-present sufferings of his kind are in front of him. War now is no  longer glorious, for it adds immeasurably to the sum of human misery.  War ought to be abolished with intemperance and slavery. And this duty  he began to utter in the ears of his country. \"The brightest traits in  the American character will derive their luster, not from the laurels  picked from the field of blood, not from the magnitude of our navy and  the success of our arms,\" he proclaimed, \"but from our exertions to  banish war from the earth, to stay the ravages of intemperance among all  that is beautiful and fair, to unfetter those who have been enthralled  by chains, which we have forged, and to spread the light of knowledge  and religious liberty, wherever darkness and superstition reign.... The  struggle is full of sublimity, the conquest embraces the world.\" Lundy  himself did not fully appreciate the immense gain, which his cause had  made in the conversion of Garrison into an active friend of the slave.  Not at once certainly. Later he knew. The discovery of a kindred spirit  in Boston exerted probably no little influence in turning for the second  time his indefatigable feet toward that city. He made it a second visit  in July, 1828, where again he met Garrison. His experience with the  ministers did not deter him from repeating the horrible tale wherever he  could get together an audience. This time he secured his first public  hearing in Boston. It was in the Federal Street Baptist Church. He spoke  not only on the subject of slavery itself, the growth of anti-slavery  societies, but on a new phase of the general subject, viz., the futility  of the Colonization Society as an abolition instrument. Garrison was  present, and treasured up in his heart the words of his friend. He did  not forget how Lundy had pressed upon his hearers the importance of  petitioning Congress for the abolition of slavery in the District of  Columbia, as we shall see further on. But poor Lundy was unfortunate  with the ministers. He got this time not the cold shoulder alone but a  clerical slap in the face as well. He had just sat down when the pastor  of the church, Rev. Howard Malcolm, uprose in wrath and inveighed  against any intermeddling of the North with slavery, and brought the  meeting with a high hand to a close. This incident was the first  collision with the church of the forlorn hope of the Abolition movement.  Trained as Garrison was in the orthodox creed and sound in that creed  almost to bigotry, this behavior of a standard-bearer of the church,  together with the apathy displayed by the clergy on a former occasion,  caused probably the first \"little rift within the lute\" of his creed,  \"that by and by will make the music mute, and, ever widening, slowly  silence all.\" For in religion as in love, \"Unfaith in aught is want of  faith in all.\" The Rev. Howard Malcolm's arbitrary proceeding had  prevented the organization of an anti-slavery committee. But this was  affected at a second meeting of the friends of the slave. Garrison was  one of the twenty gentlemen who were appointed such a committee. His  zeal and energy far exceeded the zeal and energy of the remaining  nineteen. He did not need the earnest exhortation of Lundy to impress  upon his memory the importance of \"activity and steady perseverance.\" He  perceived almost at once that everything depended on them. And so he had  formed plans for a vigorous campaign against the existence of slavery in  the District of Columbia. But before he was ready to set out along the  line of work, which he had laid down for Massachusetts, the scene of his  labors shifted to Bennington, Vermont. Before he left Boston, Lundy had  recognized him as \"a valuable coadjutor.\" The relationship between the  two men was becoming beautifully close. The more Lundy saw of Garrison,  the more he must have seemed to him a man after his own heart. And so no  wonder that he was solicitous of fastening him to his cause with hooks  of steel. The older had written the younger reformer a letter almost  paternal in tone--he must do thus and thus, he must not be disappointed  if he finds the heavy end of the burthen borne by himself, while those  associated with him do little to keep the wheels moving, he must  remember that \"a few will have the labor to perform and the honor to  share.\" Then there creeps into his words a grain of doubt, a vague fear  lest his young ally should take his hands from the plough and go the way  of all men, and here are the words which Paul might have written to  Timothy: \"I hope you will persevere in your work, steadily, but not make  too large calculations on what may be accomplished in a particularly  stated time. You have now girded on a holy warfare. Lay not down your  weapons until honorable terms are obtained. _The God of hosts is on your  side._ Steadiness and faithfulness will most assuredly overcome every  obstacle.\" The older apostle had yet to learn that the younger always  did what he undertook in the field of morals and philanthropy.    But the scene had shifted from Boston to Bennington, and with the young  reformer goes also his plan of campaign for anti-slavery work. The  committee of twenty, now nineteen since his departure, slumbered and  slept in the land of benevolent intentions, a practical illustration of  Lundy's pungent saying, that \"philanthropists are the slowest creatures  breathing. They think forty times before they act.\" The committee never  acted, but its one member in Vermont did act, and that promptly and  powerfully as shall shortly appear. Garrison had gone to Bennington to  edit the _Journal of the Times_ in the interest of the reelection of  John Quincy Adams to the Presidency. For this object he was engaged as  editor of the paper. What he was engaged to do he performed faithfully  and ably, but along with his fulfillment of his contract with the  friends of Mr. Adams, he carried the one which he had made with humanity  likewise. In his salutatory he outlined his intentions in this regard  thus: \"We have three objects in view, which we shall pursue through  life, whether in this place or elsewhere--namely, the suppression of  intemperance and its associate vices, the gradual emancipation of every  slave in the republic, and the perpetuity of national peace. In  discussing these topics what is wanting in vigor shall be made up in  zeal.\" From the issue of that first number if the friends of Adams had  no cause to complain of the character of his zeal and vigor in their  service, neither had the friends of humanity. What he had proposed doing  in Massachusetts as a member of the anti-slavery committee of twenty, he  performed with remarkable energy and success in Vermont. It was to  obtain signatures not by the hundred to a petition for the abolition of  slavery in the District of Columbia, but by the thousands, and that from  all parts of the State. He sent copies of the petition to every  postmaster in Vermont with the request that he obtain signatures in his  neighborhood. Through his exertions a public meeting of citizens of  Bennington was held and indorsed the petition. The plan for polling the  anti-slavery sentiment of the State worked admirably. The result was a  monster petition with 2,352 names appended. This he forwarded to the  seat of Government. It was a powerful prayer, but as to its effect,  Garrison had no delusions. He possessed even then singularly clear ideas  as to how the South would receive such petitions, and of the course  which it would pursue to discourage their presentation. He was no less  clear as to how the friends of freedom ought to carry themselves under  the circumstances. In the _Journal of the Times_ of November, 1828, he  thus expressed himself: \"It requires no spirit of prophecy to predict  that it (the petition) will create great opposition. An attempt will be  made to frighten Northern 'dough-faces' as in case of the Missouri  question. There will be an abundance of furious declamation, menace, and  taunt. Are we, therefore, to approach the subject timidly--with half a  heart--as if we were treading on forbidden ground? No, indeed, but  earnestly, fearlessly, as becomes men, who are determined to clear their  country and themselves from the guilt of oppressing God's free and  lawful creatures.\" About the same time he began to make his assaults on  the personal representatives of the slave-power in Congress, cauterizing  in the first instance three Northern \"dough-faces,\" who had voted  against some resolutions, looking to the abolition of the slave-trade  and slavery itself in the District of Columbia. So while the South thus  early was seeking to frighten the North from the agitation of the  slavery question in Congress, Garrison was unconsciously preparing a  countercheck by making it dangerous for a Northern man to practice  Southern principles in the National Legislature. He did not mince his  words, but called a spade a spade, and sin, sin. He perceived at once  that if he would kill the sin of slave-holding, he could not spare the  sinner. And so he spoke the names of the delinquents from the housetop of  the _Journal of the Times_, stamping upon their brows the scarlet letter  of their crime against liberty. He had said in the October before: \"It  is time that a voice of remonstrance went forth from the North, that  should peal in the ears of every slaveholder like a roar of thunder....  For ourselves, we are resolved to agitate this subject to the utmost;  nothing but death shall prevent us from denouncing a crime which has no  parallel in human depravity; we shall take high ground. _The alarm must  be perpetual._\" A voice of remonstrance, with thunder growl  accompaniment, was rising higher and clearer from the pen of the young  editor. His tone of earnestness was deepening to the stern"]]]
