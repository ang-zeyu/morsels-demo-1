For a moment  he sank below the surface, but the two air-tight jars quickly rose and  bore him up with them. There was a bustle on board the ship, there was  some random firing of muskets in the direction of the splashing which  the watch had heard, but none of the balls struck the pirate or his  jars, and he soon floated out of sight and hearing. Kicking out with his  legs, and paddling as well as he could with one hand while he held on to  the jars with the other, he at last managed to reach the land, and ran  as fast as he could into the dark woods beyond the town.    Bartholemy was now greatly in fear that, when his escape was discovered,  he would be tracked by bloodhounds,--for these dogs were much used by  the Spaniards in pursuing escaping slaves or prisoners,--and he  therefore did not feel safe in immediately making his way along the  coast, which was what he wished to do. If the hounds should get upon his  trail, he was a lost man. The desperate pirate, therefore, determined to  give the bloodhounds no chance to follow him, and for three days he  remained in a marshy forest, in the dark recesses of which he could  hide, and where the water, which covered the ground, prevented the dogs  from following his scent. He had nothing to eat except a few roots of  water-plants, but he was accustomed to privation, and these kept him  alive. Often he heard the hounds baying on the dry land adjoining the  marsh, and sometimes he saw at night distant torches, which he was sure  were carried by men who were hunting for him.    But at last the pursuit seemed to be given up; and hearing no more dogs  and seeing no more flickering lights, Bartholemy left the marsh and set  out on his long journey down the coast. The place he wished to reach was  called Golpho Triste, which was forty leagues away, but where he had  reason to suppose he would find some friends. When he came out from  among the trees, he mounted a small hill and looked back upon the town.  The public square was lighted, and there in the middle of it he saw the  gallows which had been erected for his execution, and this sight,  doubtless, animated him very much during the first part of his journey.    The terrible trials and hardships which Bartholemy experienced during  his tramp along the coast were such as could have been endured only by  one of the strongest and toughest of men. He had found in the marsh an  old gourd, or calabash, which he had filled with fresh water,--for he  could expect nothing but sea-water during his journey,--and as for  solid food he had nothing but the raw shellfish which he found upon the  rocks; but after a diet of roots, shellfish must have been a very  agreeable change, and they gave him all the strength and vigor he  needed. Very often he found streams and inlets which he was obliged to  ford, and as he could see that they were always filled with alligators,  the passage of them was not very pleasant. His method of getting across  one of these narrow streams, was to hurl rocks into the water until he  had frightened away the alligators immediately in front of him, and  then, when he had made for himself what seemed to be a free passage, he  would dash in and hurry across.    At other times great forests stretched down to the very coast, and  through these he was obliged to make his way, although he could hear the  roars and screams of wild beasts all about him. Any one who is afraid to  go down into a dark cellar to get some apples from a barrel at the foot  of the stairs, can have no idea of the sort of mind possessed by  Bartholemy Portuguez. The animals might howl around him and glare at him  with their shining eyes, and the alligators might lash the water into  foam with their great tails, but he was bound for Golpho Triste and was  not to be stopped on his way by anything alive.    But at last he came to something not alive, which seemed to be an  obstacle which would certainly get the better of him. This was a wide  river, flowing through the inland country into the sea. He made his way  up the shore of this river for a considerable distance, but it grew but  little narrower, and he could see no chance of getting across. He could  not swim and he had no wine-jars now with which to buoy himself up, and  if he had been able to swim he would probably have been eaten up by  alligators soon after he left the shore. But a man in his situation  would not be likely to give up readily; he had done so much that he was  ready to do more if he could only find out what to do.    Now a piece of good fortune happened to him, although to an ordinary  traveller it might have been considered a matter of no importance  whatever. On the edge of the shore, where it had floated down from some  region higher up the river, Bartholemy perceived an old board, in which  there were some long and heavy rusty nails. Greatly encouraged by this  discovery the indefatigable traveller set about a work which resembled  that of the old woman who wanted a needle, and who began to rub a  crow-bar on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size. Bartholemy  carefully knocked all the nails out of the board, and then finding a  large flat stone, he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it  into the shape of a rude knife blade, which he made as sharp as he  could. Then with these tools he undertook the construction of a raft,  working away like a beaver, and using the sharpened nails instead of his  teeth. He cut down a number of small trees, and when he had enough of  these slender trunks he bound them together with reeds and osiers, which  he found on the river bank. So, after infinite labor and trial he  constructed a raft which would bear him on the surface of the water.  When he had launched this he got upon it, gathering up his legs so as to  keep out of reach of the alligators, and with a long pole pushed himself  off from shore. Sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole  against the bottom, he at last got across the river and took up his  journey upon dry land.    But our pirate had not progressed very far upon the other side of the  river before he met with a new difficulty of a very formidable  character. This was a great forest of mangrove trees, which grow in  muddy and watery places and which have many roots, some coming down from  the branches, and some extending themselves in a hopeless tangle in the  water and mud. It would have been impossible for even a stork to walk  through this forest, but as there was no way of getting around it  Bartholemy determined to go through it, even if he could not walk. No  athlete of the present day, no matter if he should be a most  accomplished circus-man, could reasonably expect to perform the feat  which this bold pirate successfully accomplished. For five or six  leagues he went through that mangrove forest, never once setting his  foot upon the ground,--by which is meant mud, water, and roots,--but  swinging himself by his hands and arms, from branch to branch, as if he  had been a great ape, only resting occasionally, drawing himself upon a  stout limb where he might sit for a while and get his breath. If he had  slipped while he was swinging from one limb to another and had gone down  into the mire and roots beneath him, it is likely that he would never  have been able to get out alive. But he made no slips. He might not have  had the agility and grace of a trapeze performer, but his grasp was  powerful and his arms were strong, and so he swung and clutched, and  clutched and swung, until he had gone entirely through the forest and  had come out on the open coast.          Chapter VIII    How Bartholemy rested Himself      It was full two weeks from the time that Bartholemy began his most  adventurous and difficult journey before he reached the little town of  Golpho Triste, where, as he had hoped, he found some of his buccaneer  friends. Now that his hardships and dangers were over, and when, instead  of roots and shellfish, he could sit down to good, plentiful meals, and  stretch himself upon a comfortable bed, it might have been supposed that  Bartholemy would have given himself a long rest, but this hardy pirate  had no desire for a vacation at this time. Instead of being worn out and  exhausted by his amazing exertions and semi-starvation, he arrived among  his friends vigorous and energetic and exceedingly anxious to recommence  business as soon as possible. He told them of all that had happened to  him, what wonderful good fortune had come to him, and what terrible bad  fortune had quickly followed it, and when he had related his adventures  and his dangers he astonished even his piratical friends by asking them  to furnish him with a small vessel and about twenty men, in order that  he might go back and revenge himself, not only for what had happened to  him, but for what would have happened if he had not taken his affairs  into his own hands.    To do daring and astounding deeds is part of the business of a pirate,  and although it was an uncommonly bold enterprise that Bartholemy  contemplated, he got his vessel and he got his men, and away he sailed.  After a voyage of about eight days he came in sight of the little  seaport town, and sailing slowly along the coast, he waited until  nightfall before entering the harbor. Anchored at a considerable  distance from shore was the great Spanish ship on which he had been a  prisoner, and from which he would have been taken and hung in the public  square; the sight of the vessel filled his soul with a savage fury known  only to pirates and bull dogs.    As the little vessel slowly approached the great ship, the people on  board the latter thought it was a trading-vessel from shore, and allowed  it to come alongside, such small craft seldom coming from the sea.

Then, after further meditation, he decided that  neither Shelley nor Burns would quite do for a young girl's room, and  set them aside in favour of a portrait of Samuel Butler.  To these he  added a framed text that he was very fond of and had hung over his own  desk.  He had once clipped it from a copy of Life and found much  pleasure in it.  It runs thus:                          ON THE RETURN OF A BOOK                         LENT TO A FRIEND      I GIVE humble and hearty thanks for the safe return of this book which  having endured the perils of my friend's bookcase, and the bookcases of  my friend's friends, now returns to me in reasonably good condition.    I GIVE humble and hearty thanks that my friend did not see fit to give  this book to his infant as a plaything, nor use it as an ash-tray for  his burning cigar, nor as a teething-ring for his mastiff.    WHEN I lent this book I deemed it as lost:  I was resigned to the  bitterness of the long parting:  I never thought to look upon its pages  again.    BUT NOW that my book is come back to me, I rejoice and am exceeding  glad!  Bring hither the fatted morocco and let us rebind the volume and  set it on the shelf of honour:  for this my book was lent, and is  returned again.    PRESENTLY, therefore, I may return some of the books that I myself have  borrowed.      \"There!\" he thought.  \"That will convey to her the first element of  book morality.\"    These decorations having been displayed on the walls, he bethought  himself of the books that should stand on the bedside shelf.    This is a question that admits of the utmost nicety of discussion.  Some authorities hold that the proper books for a guest-room are of a  soporific quality that will induce swift and painless repose.  This  school advises The Wealth of Nations, Rome under the Caesars, The  Statesman's Year Book, certain novels of Henry James, and The Letters  of Queen Victoria (in three volumes).  It is plausibly contended that  books of this kind cannot be read (late at night) for more than a few  minutes at a time, and that they afford useful scraps of information.    Another branch of opinion recommends for bedtime reading short stories,  volumes of pithy anecdote, swift and sparkling stuff that may keep one  awake for a space, yet will advantage all the sweeter slumber in the  end.  Even ghost stories and harrowing matter are maintained seasonable  by these pundits.  This class of reading comprises O. Henry, Bret  Harte, Leonard Merrick, Ambrose Bierce, W. W. Jacobs, Daudet, de  Maupassant, and possibly even On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw, that  grievous classic of the railway bookstalls whereof its author, Mr.  Thomas W. Jackson, has said \"It will sell forever, and a thousand years  afterward.\" To this might be added another of Mr. Jackson's onslaughts  on the human intelligence, I'm From Texas, You Can't Steer Me, whereof  is said (by the author) \"It is like a hard-boiled egg, you can't beat  it.\" There are other of Mr. Jackson's books, whose titles escape  memory, whereof he has said \"They are a dynamite for sorrow.\" Nothing  used to annoy Mifflin more than to have someone come in and ask for  copies of these works.  His brother-in-law, Andrew McGill, the writer,  once gave him for Christmas (just to annoy him) a copy of On a Slow  Train Through Arkansaw sumptuously bound and gilded in what is known to  the trade as \"dove-coloured ooze.\" Roger retorted by sending Andrew  (for his next birthday) two volumes of Brann the Iconoclast bound in  what Robert Cortes Holliday calls \"embossed toadskin.\"  But that is  apart from the story.    To the consideration of what to put on Miss Titania's bookshelf Roger  devoted the delighted hours of the morning.  Several times Helen called  him to come down and attend to the shop, but he was sitting on the  floor, unaware of numbed shins, poring over the volumes he had carted  upstairs for a final culling.  \"It will be a great privilege,\" he said  to himself, \"to have a young mind to experiment with.  Now my wife,  delightful creature though she is, was--well, distinctly mature when I  had the good fortune to meet her; I have never been able properly to  supervise her mental processes.  But this Chapman girl will come to us  wholly unlettered.  Her father said she had been to a fashionable  school:  that surely is a guarantee that the delicate tendrils of her  mind have never begun to sprout.  I will test her (without her knowing  it) by the books I put here for her.  By noting which of them she  responds to, I will know how to proceed.  It might be worth while to  shut up the shop one day a week in order to give her some brief talks  on literature.  Delightful!  Let me see, a little series of talks on  the development of the English novel, beginning with Tom Jones--hum,  that would hardly do!  Well, I have always longed to be a teacher, this  looks like a chance to begin.  We might invite some of the neighbours  to send in their children once a week, and start a little school.  Causeries du lundi, in fact!  Who knows I may yet be the Sainte Beuve  of Brooklyn.\"    Across his mind flashed a vision of newspaper clippings--\"This  remarkable student of letters, who hides his brilliant parts under the  unassuming existence of a second-hand bookseller, is now recognized as  the----\"    \"Roger!\" called Mrs. Mifflin from downstairs:  \"Front! someone wants to  know if you keep back numbers of Foamy Stories.\"    After he had thrown out the intruder, Roger returned to his meditation.  \"This selection,\" he mused, \"is of course only tentative.  It is to act  as a preliminary test, to see what sort of thing interests her.  First  of all, her name naturally suggests Shakespeare and the Elizabethans.  It's a remarkable name, Titania Chapman: there must be great virtue in  prunes!  Let's begin with a volume of Christopher Marlowe.  Then Keats,  I guess:  every young person ought to shiver over St. Agnes' Eve on a  bright cold winter evening.  Over Bemerton's, certainly, because it's a  bookshop story.  Eugene Field's Tribune Primer to try out her sense of  humour.  And Archy, by all means, for the same reason.  I'll go down  and get the Archy scrapbook.\"    It should be explained that Roger was a keen admirer of Don Marquis,  the humourist of the New York Evening Sun.  Mr. Marquis once lived in  Brooklyn, and the bookseller was never tired of saying that he was the  most eminent author who had graced the borough since the days of Walt  Whitman.  Archy, the imaginary cockroach whom Mr. Marquis uses as a  vehicle for so much excellent fun, was a constant delight to Roger, and  he had kept a scrapbook of all Archy's clippings.  This bulky tome he  now brought out from the grotto by his desk where his particular  treasures were kept.  He ran his eye over it, and Mrs. Mifflin heard  him utter shrill screams of laughter.    \"What on earth is it?\" she asked.    \"Only Archy,\" he said, and began to read aloud--         down in a wine vault underneath the city         two old men were sitting they were drinking booze       torn were their garments hair and beards were gritty         one had an overcoat but hardly any shoes         overhead the street cars through the streets were running         filled with happy people going home to christmas       in the adirondacks the hunters all were gunning         big ships were sailing down by the isthmus         in came a little tot for to kiss her granny         such a little totty she could scarcely tottle       saying kiss me grandpa kiss your little nanny         but the old man beaned her with a whisky bottle.         outside the snowflakes began for to flutter         far at sea the ships were sailing with the seamen       not another word did angel nanny utter         her grandsire chuckled and pledged the whisky demon         up spake the second man he was worn and weary         tears washed his face which otherwise was pasty       she loved her parents who commuted on the erie         brother im afraid you struck a trifle hasty         she came to see you all her pretty duds on         bringing christmas posies from her mothers garden       riding in the tunnel underneath the hudson         brother was it rum caused your heart to harden----    \"What on earth is there funny in that?\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Poor  little lamb, I think it was terrible.\"    \"There's more of it,\" cried Roger, and opened his mouth to continue.    \"No more, thank you,\" said Helen.  \"There ought to be a fine for using  the meter of Love in the Valley that way.  I'm going out to market so  if the bell rings you'll have to answer it.\"    Roger added the Archy scrapbook to Miss Titania's shelf, and went on  browsing over the volumes he had collected.    \"The Nigger of the Narcissus,\" he said to himself, \"for even if she  doesn't read the story perhaps she'll read the preface, which not  marble nor the monuments of princes will outlive.  Dickens' Christmas  Stories to introduce her to Mrs. Lirriper, the queen of landladies.  Publishers tell me that Norfolk Street, Strand, is best known for the  famous literary agent that has his office there, but I wonder how many  of them know that that was where Mrs. Lirriper had her immortal  lodgings?  The Notebooks of Samuel Butler, just to give her a little  intellectual jazz.  The Wrong Box, because it's the best farce in the  language.  Travels with a Donkey, to show her what good writing is  like.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to give her a sense of pity  for human woes--wait a minute, though:  that's a pretty broad book for  young ladies.  I guess we'll put it aside and see what else there is.  Some of Mr. Mosher's catalogues:  fine! they'll show her the true  spirit of what one book-lover calls biblio-bliss.  Walking-Stick  Papers--yes, there are still good essayists running "]]]
