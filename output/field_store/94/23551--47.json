Community Influences_    In an examination of the factors which promote juvenile delinquency  special attention must be given to the type of community in which  children grow up. The more normal and well balanced a community is, the  greater are the child's chances of developing a well-balanced  personality. The teaching at school may be good, the home training  satisfactory, but these good influences may be upset by defects in the  neighbourhood. When the atmosphere of home or school is unsatisfactory,  the chances of normal healthy development are made progressively worse  for any child whose community environment is also poor.      =(1) Housing Development=    In New Zealand there are a number of communities which have grown  quickly and have become unbalanced. No one doubts the urgent need that  there has been for houses to accommodate a rapidly expanding population.  On the other hand, in the light of experience, it is considered that  wise planning in the future could avoid some of the disadvantages which  have become evident in these areas. These disadvantages are:      _(a) Fewer Adults_    Large-scale housing is primarily for married people with growing  families. Eventually the number of young people is much greater than the  number of adults. There is a pronounced difference between a settlement  of mushroom growth and one that has developed gradually with large  family homes and smaller homes, grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts,  and children.    In order to illustrate the disparity between the adult and juvenile  population in all such areas the Committee obtained from the Education  Department a statement of the primary and secondary school children in  Wellington and the Hutt Valley as at 30 August 1954:                                                    _Wellington        Hutt_  Pupils at primary public and private schools           15,300      12,250  Pupils at secondary public and private schools          5,750       3,000                                                         ------      ------                                                         21,050      15,250    It must not be overlooked that the homes of many children who attend  schools in Wellington are situated outside the ordinary confines of the  city; many of the children are resident in the Hutt Valley. For  instance, 250-300 of the girls at Wellington College come to that  college from the Hutt, and many more children from outside the city  attend other city schools. The exact total is not readily assessable,  but it is known to be considerable. On the other hand, it is not thought  that the rolls of Hutt schools are increased by the attendance of pupils  from outside that district.    Another statement shows that in Wellington city 70.4 per cent of the  total population are adults, whereas in the Hutt only 60.1 per cent are  adults.    If that abnormal distribution of population is a causative factor in  juvenile delinquency, the situation will have to be carefully watched  because:      (i) A graph compiled for the Committee shows that the biggest    number of children is in the two-to-four-year-old group. When one    considers that the delinquency now being considered is in the    13-to-17-year-old group, the period of greatest danger will not be    reached until about another nine years have elapsed. This is a    disturbing prospect and demands serious consideration.      (ii) There are many similar housing settlements in New Zealand.    The absence of public disclosures of delinquency in any of those    places must not be taken to mean that they are free from it.      (iii) In areas settled largely by people with growing families the    rate of increase is striking. In planning one post-primary school    the rate of 0.7 children to a family was adopted. Three years    later the rate was found to be 1.5 per family.      _(b) Absence of a Community Spirit_    In the normal development of towns and suburbs a community spirit comes  from an ability to make one's own choice of dwelling. A newly-married  couple prefers one district or one suburb to another, either because  their relatives or friends are there, because it is handy to the  husband's work, because of \"the view\", or for similar reasons. The house  they build or buy or rent was the house of their choice. In that way  they develop pride of ownership or of possession. They join such of the  local churches, societies, and clubs as already exist, and themselves  organize and support other agencies of community value.    In quickly settled housing areas this community spirit has not yet had  time to develop. The people have not chosen to live there: a house has  been \"allotted\" to them. With a feeling of relief that their immediate  problem is solved, they move in; but they soon find themselves in an  area without any established traditions or the buildings associated with  those traditions. Churches, schools, halls, and monuments are entirely  non-existent or very new. The areas left for sports grounds, parks, and  reserves are still largely undeveloped. The occupants of the new houses  have not the financial capacity to provide these things, and there are  seldom any private benefactors, because there is not a stratum of  wealthy people in or near these settlements who might be benevolently  inclined to help the district where they reside. The help which the new  residents can give, or obtain from the State, churches, or other  organizations to provide a community fellowship, must fall far short of  what is usually obtainable in areas which grow up normally and  naturally.      _(c) Overcrowding of Houses_    Houses in the new areas are often found too small as the boys and girls  grow up. The result is streets of overcrowded homes unsuitable for  family life. The tendency for the young people to seek their pleasures  away from their home and district is therefore greater than it is in  mature communities.      _(d) Tendency to Form Groups or Gangs_    Where a large number of children live near one another, and many of them  are left by their parents to their own devices, the formation of groups  or gangs is inevitable. Some of these children are not moulded into the  activities of churches or other helpful organizations. They simply  coalesce by the accident of their circumstances, and make their own fun,  in which, unfortunately, the influence for good of the better among them  is often outweighed by the misbehaviour and dangerous propensities of  others.      _(e) Emotional and Mental Factors_    New housing areas tend to be populated by a large proportion of those  people whose outlook on life has been affected by disturbances in their  early married years. Marrying during, or soon after, the Second World  War, they were obliged to live in small apartments or transit camps and  were thereby unable to live the normal life of a married couple. Either  because of this, or because of conditions existing in the housing areas,  there does not seem to be the same group willingness to improve their  conditions as is seen in older communities. Indeed, individual cases  show a virtual lack of self-reliance.    There is the further factor that when the breadwinner has to travel a  long distance to work he is not able to spend as much time with his  family as is desirable, or to share in the work of the community.      _(f) Little Variety in Amenities_    Young communities cannot immediately provide, from their own resources  and enthusiasm, all the amenities normal in an established settlement.  Necessarily, these must be added one by one, and in the meantime the  residents have to participate in a restricted range of activities.           *       *       *       *       *    All the above matters show how difficult it is to expect a community  spirit in any area which is just an aggregation of houses. Many years  must pass before there can be anything like a desirable balance of  community interests in such an area. Juvenile delinquency in new housing  settlements might conceivably be reduced, if, in future, State houses  were not erected in extensive blocks, but were built in such smaller  numbers as could be more easily integrated into existing communities of  people.      =(2) Recreation and Entertainment=    As in other forms of delinquency, the recent outbreak of immorality or,  more correctly, the revealed evidence of it has directed the minds of  many to an assumed dearth of organized recreation and entertainment.  Such a thought more easily rises to the mind when it is known that many  cases have occurred in new settlements where the building of State  houses has gone far ahead of the ability of the community to arrange for  the provision of playing fields, halls, and clubs.    Further, those who have special ideas of the importance of hobbies, pet  animals, square dancing, and things of that sort have been active in  urging upon the Committee that greater attention should be given to such  matters as possible ways of alleviating the trouble.    It is true that a child who joins sporting and other clubs, or has its  mind directed towards hobbies or other interests, is less likely to  become a delinquent than one whose thoughts are not similarly occupied.  But it is wrong to assume that the present trouble can be cured by the  extension or encouragement of such activities. The reason is that the  pre-delinquent is not attracted by such forms of recreation or healthy  pleasure. If he is persuaded to join a club or society, he may soon make  such a nuisance of himself that the leader will be obliged, for the good  of the club, to rebuke him or warn him that he will not be allowed to  attend in future unless he behaves. The pre-delinquent, therefore,  either does not join, or else soon leaves, a club where he cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],[0,"McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#8)"],[1,".     0    3.

We can not see our thoughts, or hear, or taste, or feel  them; and yet what mighty power they have!  3. Sir Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a  summer's evening, when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He  began to think, and, in trying to find out why the apple fell,  discovered how the earth, sun, moon, and stars are kept in  their places.  4. A boy named James Watt sat quietly by the fireside,  watching the lid of the tea kettle as it moved up and down.  He began to think; he wanted to find out why the steam in  the kettle moved the heavy lid.     102  ECLECTIC SERIES.      5. From that time he went on thinking and thinking; and  when he became a man, he improved the steam engine so  much that it could, with the greatest ease, do the work of  many horses.  6. When you see a steamboat, a steam mill, or a  locomotive, remember that it would never have been built if  it had not been for the hard thinking of some one.  7. A man named Galileo was once standing in the  cathedral of Pisa, when he saw a chandelier swaying to and  fro.     THIRD READER.  103  8. This set him thinking, and it led to the invention of the  pendulum.  9. James Ferguson was a poor Scotch shepherd boy. Once,  seeing the inside of a watch, he was filled with wonder.  \"Why should I not make a watch?\" thought he.  10. But how was he to get the materials out of which to  make the wheels and the mainspring? He soon found how to  get them: he made the mainspring out of a piece of  whalebone. He then made a wooden clock which kept good  time.  11. He began, also, to copy pictures with a pen, and  portraits with oil colors. In a few years, while still a small  boy, he earned money enough to support his father.  12. When he became a man, he went to London to live.  Some of the wisest men in England, and the king himself,  used to attend his lectures. His motto was, \"I will think of it;\"  and he made his thoughts useful to himself and the world.  13. Boys, when you have a difficult lesson to learn, do n't  feel discouraged, and ask some one to help you before  helping yourselves. Think, and by thinking you will learn  how to think to some purpose.     104  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XL.  CHARLIE AND ROB.  1. \"Do n't you hate splitting wood?\" asked Charlie, as he  sat down on a log to hinder Rob for a while.  2. \"No, I rather like it. When I get hold of a tough old  fellow, I say, 'See here, now, you think you're the stronger,  and are going to beat me; so I'll split you up into kindling  wood.\"  3. \"Pshaw!\" said Charlie, laughing; \"and it's only a stick  of wood.\"  4. \"Yes; but you see I pretend it's a lesson, or a tough job  of any kind, and it's nice to conquer it.\"  5. \"I do n't want to conquer such things; I do n't care what  becomes of them. I wish I were a man, and a rich one.\"  6. \"Well, Charlie, if you live long enough you'll be a man,  without wishing for it; and as for the rich part, I mean to be  that myself.\"  7. \"You do. How do you expect to get your money? By  sawing wood?\"  8. \"May be--some of it; that's as good a     THIRD READER.  105        way as any, so long as it lasts. I do n't care how I get rich,  you know, so that it's in an honest and useful way.\"  9. \"I'd like to sleep over the next ten years, and wake up to  find myself a young man with a splendid education and  plenty of money.\"     106  ECLECTIC SERIES.  10. \"Humph! I am not sleepy--a night at a time is enough  for me. I mean to work the next ten years. You see there are  things that you've got to work out--you can't sleep them out.\"  11. \"I hate work,\" said Charlie, \"that is, such work as  sawing and splitting wood, and doing chores. I'd like to do  some big work, like being a clerk in a bank or something of  that sort.\"  12. \"Wood has to be sawed and split before it can be  burned,\" said Rob. \"I do n't know but I'll be a clerk in a bank  some time; I'm working towards it. I'm keeping father's  accounts for him.\"  13. How Charlie laughed! \"I should think that was a long  way from being a bank clerk. I suppose your father sells two  tables and six chairs, some days, does n't he?\"  14. \"Sometimes more than that, and sometimes not so  much,\" said Rob, in perfect good humor.  15. \"I did n't say I was a bank clerk now.  I said I was  working towards it. Am I not nearer it by keeping a little bit  of a book than I should be if I did n't keep any book at all?\"     THIRD READER.  107  16. \"Not a whit--such things happen,\" said Charlie, as he  started to go.  17. Now, which of these boys, do you think, grew up to be  a rich and useful man, and which of them joined a party of  tramps before he was thirty years old?        LESSON XLI.    RAY AND HIS KITE.  1. Ray was thought to be an odd boy. You will think him  so, too, when you have read this story.  2. Ray liked well enough to play with the boys at school;  yet he liked better to be alone under the shade of some tree,  reading a fairy tale or dreaming daydreams. But there was  one sport that he liked as well as his companions; that was  kiteflying.  3. One day when he was flying his kite, he said to himself,  \"I wonder if anybody ever tried to fly a kite at night. It seems     108  ECLECTIC SERIES.  to me it would be nice. But then, if it were very dark, the kite  could not be seen. What if I should fasten a light to it,  though? That would make it show. I'll try it this very night.\"  4. As soon as it was dark, without saying a word to  anybody, he took his kite and lantern, and went to a large,  open lot, about a quarter of a mile from his home. \"Well,\"  thought he, \"this is queer. How lonely and still it seems  without any other boys around! But I am going to fly my  kite, anyway.\"  5. So he tied the lantern, which was made of tin punched  full of small holes, to the tail of his kite. Then he pitched the  kite, and,        THIRD READER. 109  after several attempts, succeeded in making it rise. Up it  went, higher and higher, as Ray let out the string. When the  string was all unwound, he tied it to a fence; and then he  stood and gazed at his kite as it floated high up in the air.  6. While Ray was enjoying his sport, some people who  were out on the street in the village, saw a strange light in  the sky. They gathered in groups to watch it. Now it was still  for a few seconds, then it seemed to be jumping up and  down; then it made long sweeps back and forth through the  air.  7. \"What can it be?\" said one person. \"How strange!\" said  another. \"It can not be a comet; for comets have tails,\" said a  third. \"Perhaps it's a big firefly,\" said another.  8. At last some of the men determined to find out what  this strange light was--whether it was a hobgoblin dancing in  the air, or something dropped from the sky. So off they  started to get as near it as they could.  9. While this was taking place, Ray, who had got tired of  standing, was seated in a fence corner, behind a tree. He  could see     110  ECLECTIC SERIES.  the men as they approached; but they did not see him.  10. When they were directly under the light, and saw what  it was, they looked at each other, laughing, and said, \"This is  some boy's trick; and it has fooled us nicely. Let us keep the  secret, and have our share of the joke.\"  11. Then they laughed again, and went back to the village;  and some of the simple people there have not yet found out  what that strange light was.  12. When thc men had gone, Ray thought it was time for  him to go; so he wound up his string, picked up his kite and  lantern, and went home. His mother had been wondering  what had become of him.  13. When she heard what he had been doing, she hardly  knew whether to laugh or scold; but I think she laughed, and  told him that it was time for him to go to bed.         THIRD READER.  111    LESSON XLII.  BEWARE OF THE FIRST DRINK.    1. \"Uncle Philip, as the day is fine, will you take a walk  with us this morning?\"  2. \"Yes, boys. Let me get my hat and cane, and we will  take a ramble. I will tell you a story as we go. Do you know  poor old Tom Smith?\"  3. \"Know him! Why, Uncle Philip, everybody knows him.  He is such a shocking drunkard, and swears so horribly.\"  4. \"Well, I have known him ever since we were boys  together. There was not a more decent, well-behaved boy  among us. After he left school, his father died, and he was  put into a store in the city. There, he fell into bad company.  5. \"Instead of spending his evenings in reading, he would  go to the theater and to balls. He soon learned to play cards,  and of course to play for money. He lost more than he could  pay.  6. \"He wrote to his poor mother, and told her his losses.  She sent him money to pay his debts, and told him to come  home.     112  ECLECTIC SERIES.  7. \"He did come home. After all, he might still have been  useful and happy, for his friends were willing to forgive the  past. For a time, things went on well. He married a lovely  woman, gave up his bad habits, and was doing well.  8. \"But one thing, boys, ruined him forever. In the city, he  had learned to take strong drink, and he said to me"]]]
