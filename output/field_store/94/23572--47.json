There is another sn which may perhaps be derived from the Latin sinuo,      as snake, sneak, snail, snare; so likewise snap and snatch, snib, snub.      Bl imply a blast; as blow, blast, to blast, to blight, and,      metaphorically, to blast one's reputation; bleat, bleak, a bleak place,      to look bleak, or weather-beaten, black, blay, bleach, bluster, blurt,      blister, blab, bladder, blew, blabber lip't, blubber-cheek't, bloted,      blote-herrings, blast, blaze, to blow, that is, blossom, bloom; and      perhaps blood and blush.        In the native words of our tongue is to be found a great agreement      between the letters and the thing signified; and therefore the sounds      of the letters smaller, sharper, louder, closer, softer, stronger,      clearer, more obscure, and more stridulous, do very often intimate the      like effects in the things signified.        Thus words that begin with str intimate the force and effect of the      thing signified, as if probably derived from [Greek: stronnymi], or      strenuous; as strong, strength, strew, strike, streak, stroke, stripe,      strive, strife, struggle, strout, strut, stretch, strait, strict,      streight, that is, narrow, distrain, stress, distress, string, strap,      stream, streamer, strand, strip, stray, struggle, strange, stride,      stradale.        St in like manner imply strength, but in a less degree, so much only as      is sufficient to preserve what has been already communicated, rather      than acquire any new degree; as if it were derived from the Latin sto;      for example, stand, stay, that is, to remain, or to prop; staff, stay,      that is, to oppose; stop, to stuff, stifle, to stay, that is, to stop;      a stay, that is, an obstacle; stick, stut, stutter, stammer, stagger,      stickle, stick, stake, a sharp, pale, and any thing deposited at play;      stock, stem, sting, to sting, stink, stitch, stud, stuncheon, stub,      stubble, to stub up, stump, whence stumble, stalk, to stalk, step, to      stamp with the feet, whence to stamp, that is, to make an impression      and a stamp; stow, to stow, to bestow, steward, or stoward; stead,      steady, stedfast, stable, a stable, a stall, to stall, stool, stall,      still, stall, stallage, stage, still, adjective, and still, adverb:      stale, stout, sturdy, stead, stoat, stallion, stiff, stark-dead, to      starve with hunger or cold; stone, steel, stern, stanch, to stanch      blood, to stare, steep, steeple, stair, standard, a stated measure,      stately. In all these, and perhaps some others, st denote something      firm and fixed.        Thr imply a more violent degree of motion, as throw, thrust, throng,      throb, through, threat, threaten, thrall, throws.        Wr imply some sort of obliquity or distortion, as wry, to wreathe,      wrest, wrestle, wring, wrong, wrinch, wrench, wrangle, wrinkle, wrath,      wreak, wrack, wretch, wrist, wrap.        Sw imply a silent agitation, or a softer kind of lateral motion; as      sway, swag, to sway, swagger, swerve, sweat, sweep, swill, swim, swing,      swift, sweet, switch, swinge.        Nor is there much difference of sm in smooth, smug, smile, smirk,      smite; which signifies the same as to strike, but is a softer word;      small, smell, smack, smother, smart, a smart blow properly signifies      such a kind of stroke as with an originally silent motion, implied in      sm, proceeds to a quick violence, denoted by ar suddenly ended, as is      shown by t.        Cl denote a kind of adhesion or tenacity, as in cleave, clay, cling,      climb, clamber, clammy, clasp, to clasp, to clip, to clinch, cloak,      clog, close, to close, a clod, a clot, as a clot of blood, clouted      cream, a clutter, a cluster.        Sp imply a kind of dissipation or expansion, especially a quick one,      particularly if there be an r, as if it were from spargo or separo: for      example, spread, spring, sprig, sprout, sprinkle, split, splinter,      spill, spit, sputter, spatter.        Sl denote a kind of silent fall, or a less observable motion; as in      slime, slide, slip, slipper, sly, sleight, slit, slow, slack, slight,      sling, slap.        And so likewise ash, in crash, rash, gash, flash, clash, lash, slash,      plash, trash, indicate something acting more nimbly and sharply. But      ush, in crush, rush, gush, flush, blush, brush, hush, push, imply      something as acting more obtusely and dully. Yet in both there is      indicated a swift and sudden motion not instantaneous, but gradual, by      the continued sound, sh.        Thus in fling, sling, ding, swing, cling, sing, wring, sting, the      tingling of the termination ng, and the sharpness of the vowel i, imply      the continuation of a very slender motion or tremor, at length indeed      vanishing, but not suddenly interrupted. But in tink, wink, sink,      clink, chink, think, that end in a mute consonant, there is also      indicated a sudden ending.        If there be an l, as in jingle, tingle, tinkle, mingle, sprinkle,      twinkle, there is implied a frequency, or iteration of small acts. And      the same frequency of acts, but less subtile by reason of the clearer      vowel a, is indicated in jangle, tangle, spangle, mangle, wrangle,      brangle, dangle; as also in mumble, grumble, jumble. But at the same      time the close u implies something obscure or obtunded; and a congeries      of consonants mbl, denotes a confused kind of rolling or tumbling, as      in ramble, scamble, scramble, wamble, amble; but in these there is      something acute.        In nimble, the acuteness of the vowel denotes celerity. In sparkle, sp      denotes dissipation, ar an acute crackling, k a sudden interruption, l      a frequent iteration; and in like manner in sprinkle, unless in may      imply the subtilty of the dissipated guttules. Thick and thin differ in      that the former ends with an obtuse consonant, and the latter with an      acute.        In like manner, in squeek, squeak, squeal, squall, brawl, wraul, yaul,      spaul, screek, shriek, shrill, sharp, shrivel, wrinkle, crack, crash,      clash, gnash, plash, crush, hush, hisse, fisse, whist, soft, jar, hurl,      curl, whirl, buz, bustle, spindle, dwindle, twine, twist, and in many      more, we may observe the agreement of such sort of sounds with the      things signified; and this so frequently happens, that scarce any      language which I know can be compared with ours. So that one      monosyllable word, of which kind are almost all ours, emphatically      expresses what in other languages can scarce be explained but by      compounds, or decompounds, or sometimes a tedious circumlocution.    We have many words borrowed from the Latin; but the greatest part of them  were communicated by the intervention of the French; as, grace, face,  elegant, elegance, resemble.    Some verbs which seem borrowed from the Latin, are formed from the present  tense, and some from the supines.    From the present are formed spend, expend, expendo; conduce, conduco;  despise, despicio; approve, approbo; conceive, concipio.    From the supines, supplicate, supplico; demonstrate, demonstro; dispose,  dispono; expatiate, expatior; suppress, supprimo; exempt, eximo.        Nothing is more apparent than that Wallis goes too far in quest of      originals. Many of these which seem selected as immediate descendants      from the Latin, are apparently French, as, conceive, approve, expose,      exempt.    Some words purely French, not derived from the Latin, we have transferred  into our language; as, garden, garter, buckler, to advance, to cry, to  plead, from the French jardin, jartier, bouclier, avancer, crier, plaider;  though, indeed, even of these part is of Latin original.        As to many words which we have in common with the Germans, it is      doubtful whether the old Teutons borrowed them from the Latins, or the      Latins from the Teutons, or both had them from some common original; as      wine, vinum; wind, ventus; went, veni; way, via, wall, vallum; wallow,      volvo; wool, vellus; will, volo; worm, vermis; worth, virtus; wasp,      vespa; day, dies; draw, traho; tame, domo, [Greek: damao]; yoke, jugum,      [Greek: zeugos]; over, upper, super, [Greek: hyper]; am, sum, [Greek:      eimi]; break, frango; fly, volo; blow, flo. I make no doubt but the      Teutonick is more ancient than the Latin: and it is no less certain,      that the Latin, which borrowed a great number of words not only from      the Greek, especially the AEolick, but from other neighbouring      languages, as the Oscan and others, which have long become obsolete,      received not a few from the Teutonick. It is certain, that the English,      German, and other Teutonick languages, retained some derived from the      Greek, which the Latin has not; as, ax, achs, mit, ford, pfurd,      daughter, tochter, mickle, mingle, moon, sear, oar, grave, graff, to      grave, to scrape, whole, from [Greek: axine], [Greek: meta], [Greek:      porthmos], [Greek: thygater], [Greek: megalos], [Greek: mignyo],      [Greek: mene], [Greek: xeros], [Greek: grapho], [Greek: holos]. Since      they received these immediately from the Greeks, without the      intervention of the Latin language, why may not other words be derived      immediately from the same fountain, though they be likewise found among      the Latins?    Our ancestors were studious to form borrowed words, however long, into  monosyllables; and not only cut off the formative terminations, but cropped  the first syllable, especially in words beginning with a vowel; and  rejected not only vowels in the middle, but likewise consonants of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#8)"],[1,"a slight consideration, rather extraordinary,  that vessels bound to the Cape of Good Hope should find it expedient to  touch at a harbour of South America. To run across the Atlantic, and take  as a part of their course, that coast, the very existence of which was  unknown to the first navigators of these seas, seems a very circuitous  method of performing the voyage. A little examination will remove this  apparent difficulty. The calms so frequent on the African side, are of  themselves a sufficient cause to induce a navigator to keep a very  westerly course; and even the islands at which it is so often convenient  to touch will carry him within a few degrees of the South American  coast.--The returning tracks of Captain Cooks's three voyages all run  within a very small space of the 45th degree of west longitude, which is  even ten degrees further to the west than the extremity of Cape St.  Roque: and that course appears to have been taken voluntarily, without  any extraordinary inducement. But in the latitudes to which Governor  Phillip's squadron had now arrived, the old and new continent approach so  near to each other, that in avoiding the one it becomes necessary to run  within a very moderate distance of the opposite land.    In the passage from the Cape Verd Islands, the fleet suffered for some  time the inconvenience of great heat, attended by heavy rains. The heat,  however, did not at any time exceed the point already specified,* and the  precautions unremittingly observed in all the ships happily continued  efficacious in preventing any violent sickness. Nor did the oppression of  the hot weather continue so long as in these latitudes might have been  expected; for before they reached the equator the temperature had become  much more moderate.    [* 82 deg., 51. It is not unusual in England, to have the thermometer, for a  day or two in a summer, at 81 deg..]    5 July 1787    On July 5, 1787, being then in long. 26 deg. 10' west from Greenwich, the  Botany Bay fleet passed from the Northern into the Southern Hemisphere.  About three weeks more of very favourable and pleasant weather conveyed  them to Rio de Janeiro.    5-6 August 1787    On the 5th of August they anchored off the harbour, and on the evening  of the 6th were at their station within it. The land of Cape Frio had been  discovered some days before, but a deficiency of wind from that time a  little slackened their course.    Rio de Janeiro, or January River, so called because discovered by Dias de  Solis on the feast of St. Januarius, (Sept. 19) 1525, is not in fact a  river, though its name denotes that it was then supposed to be so: it is  an arm of the sea, into which a considerable number of small rivers  descends.    The city of Rio de Janeiro, called by some writers St. Sebastian, from  the name of its tutelar patron, is situated on the west side of this bay,  within less than a degree of the tropic of Capricorn, and about 43 deg. west  of Greenwich. It is at present the capital of all Brasil, and has been  for some time the residence of the Viceroy. These distinctions it  obtained in preference to St. Salvador, which was formerly the capital,  by means of the diamond mines discovered in its vicinity, in the year  1730. The place increasing rapidly by the wealth thus brought to it, was  fortified and put under the care of a governor in 1738. The port is one  of the finest in the world, very narrow at the entrance, and within  capacious enough to contain more ships than ever were assembled at one  station. It has soundings from twenty to one hundred and twenty fathoms.  A hill shaped like a sugar loaf, situated on the west side, marks the  proper bearing for entering the harbour: the situation of which is fully  pointed out at the distance of two leagues and a half by some small  islands, one of which, called Rodonda, is very high, and in form not  unlike a haycock. The mouth of the harbour is defended by forts,  particularly two, called Santa Cruz and Lozia; and the usual anchorage  within it is before the city, north of a small island named Dos Cobras.    There are in this port established fees, which are paid by all merchant  ships, Portuguese as well as strangers: 3l. 12s. each on entering the  bay, the same on going out, and 5s. 6d. a day while they remain at  anchor. The entrance fee was demanded for the transports in this  expedition, but when Governor Phillip had alledged that they were loaded  with King's stores, the payment was no more insisted upon. Nevertheless,  the Captain of the Port gave his attendance, with his boat's crew, to  assist the ships in coming in, there being at that time only a light air,  hardly sufficient to carry them up the bay.    In the narrative of Captain Cook's Voyage in 1768, we find, on his  arrival at this place, great appearance of suspicion on the part of the  Viceroy, harsh prohibitions of landing, even to the gentlemen employed in  philosophical researches, and some proceedings rather of a violent  nature. The reception given by the present Viceroy to Governor Phillip  and his officers was very different: it was polite and flattering to a  great degree, and free from every tincture of jealous caution.    Don Lewis de Varconcellos, the reigning Viceroy, belongs to one of the  noblest families in Portugal; is brother to the Marquis of Castello  Methor, and to the Count of Pombeiro. Governor Phillip, who served for  some years as a Captain in the Portuguese navy, and is deservedly much  honoured by that nation, was not personally unknown to the Viceroy,  though known in a way which, in a less liberal mind, might have produced  very different dispositions. There had been some difference between them,  on a public account, in this port, when Governor Phillip commanded the  Europe: each party had acted merely for the honour of the nation to which  he belonged, and the Viceroy, with the true spirit of a man of honour,  far from resenting a conduct so similar to his own, seemed now to make it  his object to obliterate every recollection of offence. As soon as he was  fully informed of the nature of Governor Phillip's commission, he gave it  out in orders to the garrison that the same honours should be paid to  that officer as to himself. This distinction the Governor modestly wished  to decline, but was not permitted. His officers were all introduced to  the Viceroy, and were, as well as himself, received with every possible  mark of attention to them, and regard for their country. They were  allowed to visit all parts of the city, and even to make excursions as  far as five miles into the country, entirely unattended: an indulgence  very unusual to strangers, and considering what we read of the jealousy  of the Portuguese Government respecting its diamond mines, the more  extraordinary.    Provisions were here so cheap, that notwithstanding the allowance of meat  was fixed by Governor Phillip at twenty ounces a day, the men were  victualled completely, rice, fresh vegetables, and firing included, at  three-pence three-farthings a head. Wine was not at this season to be  had, except from the retail dealers, less was therefore purchased than  would otherwise have been taken. Rum, however, was laid in; and all such  seeds and plants procured as were thought likely to flourish on the coast  of New South Wales, particularly coffee, indigo, cotton, and the  cochineal fig.* As a substitute for bread, if it should become scarce,  one hundred sacks of cassada were purchased at a very advantageous price.    [* Cactus Cochinilifer, of Linnaeus.]    Cassada, the bread of thousands in the tropical climates, affords one of  those instances in which the ingenuity of man might be said to triumph  over the intentions of nature, were it not evidently the design of  Providence that we should in all ways exert our invention and sagacity to  the utmost, for our own security and support. It is the root of a shrub  called Cassada, or Cassava Jatropha, and in its crude state is highly  poisonous. By washing, pressure, and evaporation, it is deprived of all  its noxious qualities, and being formed into cakes becomes a salubrious  and not an unpalatable substitute for bread.    By the indulgence of the Viceroy, the deficiency in the military stores  observed at the departure of the transports from England, was made up by  a supply purchased from the Royal arsenal; nor was any assistance  withheld which either the place afforded, or the stores of government  could furnish.    The circumstances, which in this place most astonish a stranger, and  particularly a Protestant, are, the great abundance of images dispersed  throughout the city, and the devotion paid to them. They are placed at  the corner of almost every street, and are never passed without a  respectful salutation; but at night they are constantly surrounded by  their respective votaries, who offer up their prayers aloud, and make the  air resound in all quarters with the notes of their hymns. The strictness  of manners in the inhabitants is not said to be at all equivalent to the  warmth of this devotion; but in all countries and climates it is found  much easier to perform external acts of reputed piety, than to acquire  the internal habits so much more essential. It must be owned, however,  that our people did not find the ladies so indulgent as some voyagers  have represented them.    It was near a month before Governor Phillip could furnish his ships with  every thing which it was necessary they should now procure. At length, on  the 4th of September he weighed anchor, and as he passed the fort,  received from the Viceroy the last compliment it was in his power to pay,  being saluted with twenty-one guns. The salute was returned by an equal  number from the Sirius; and thus ended an intercourse honourable to both  nations, and particularly to the principal officer employed in the  service of each.
