Then the lights in the houses    of ill-fame began to light up again, and women peeped out of the blinds.    The motorman was given the order to go on. The gong clanged and the    conveyance sped out of the way. For half an hour the crowd held their    place at the corner, then the patrol wagon came and the body was picked    up and hurried to the morgue.      Coroner Richard held an autopsy on the body of the Negro who was forced    out of car 98 of the Villere line and shot down. It was found that he    was wounded four times, the most serious wound being that which struck    him in the right side, passing through the lungs, and causing    hemorrhages, which brought about death.      Nobody tried to identify the poor fellow and his name is unknown.      +A VICTIM IN THE MARKET+      Soon after the murder of the man on the street car many of the same mob  marched down to the market place. There they found a colored market man  named Louis Taylor, who had gone to begin his early morning's work. He was  at once set upon by the mob and killed. The _Picayune_ account says:      Between 1 and 2 o'clock this morning a mob of several hundred men and    boys, made up of participants in many of the earlier affairs, marched on    the French Market. Louis Taylor, a Negro vegetable carrier, who is about    thirty years of age, was sitting at the soda water stand. As soon as the    mob saw him fire was opened and the Negro took to his heels. He ran    directly into another section of the mob and any number of shots were    fired at him. He fell, face down, on the floor of the market.      The police in the neighborhood rallied hurriedly and found the victim of    mob violence seemingly lifeless. Before they arrived the Negro had been    beaten severely about the head and body. The ambulance was summoned and    Taylor was carried to the charity hospital, where it was found that he    had been shot through the abdomen and arm. The examination was a hurried    one, but it sufficed to show that Taylor was mortally wounded.      After shooting Taylor the members of the mob were pluming themselves on    their exploit. \"The Nigger was at the soda water stand and we commenced    shooting him,\" said one of the rioters. \"He put his hands up and ran,    and we shot until he fell. I understand that he is still alive. If he    is, he is a wonder. He was certainly shot enough to be killed.\"      The members of the mob readily admitted that they had taken part in the    assaults which marked the earlier part of the evening.      \"We were up on Jackson Avenue and killed a Nigger on Villere Street. We    came down here, saw a nigger and killed him, too.\" This was the way they    told the story.      \"Boys, we are out of ammunition,\" said someone.      \"Well, we will keep on like we are, and if we can't get some before    morning, we will take it. We have got to keep this thing up, now we have    started.\"      This declaration was greeted by a chorus of applauding yells, and the    crowd started up the levee. Half of the men in the crowd, and they were    all of them young, were drunk.      Taylor, when seen at the charity hospital, was suffering greatly, and    presented a pitiable spectacle. His clothing was covered with blood, and    his face was beaten almost into a pulp. He said that he had gone to the    market to work and was quietly sitting down when the mob came and began    to fire on him. He was not aware at first that the crowd was after him.    When he saw its purpose he tried to run, but fell. He didn't know any of    the men in the crowd. There is hardly a chance that Taylor will recover.      The police told the crowd to move on, but no attempt was made to arrest    anyone.      +A GRAY-HAIRED VICTIM+    The bloodthirsty barbarians, having tasted blood, continued their hunt and  soon ran across an old man of seventy-five years. His life had been spent  in hard work about the French market, and he was well known as an  unoffending, peaceable and industrious old man.    But that made no difference to the mob. He was a Negro, and with a  fiendishness that was worse than that of cannibals they beat his life out.  The report says:      There was another gang of men parading the streets in the lower part of    the city, looking for any stray Negro who might be on the streets. As    they neared the corner of Dauphine and Kerlerec, a square below    Esplanade Avenue, they came upon Baptiste Thilo, an aged Negro, who    works in the French Market.      Thilo for years has been employed by the butchers and fish merchants to    carry baskets from the stalls to the wagons, and unload the wagons as    they arrive in the morning. He was on his way to the market, when the    mob came upon him. One of the gang struck the old Negro, and as he fell,    another in the crowd, supposed to be a young fellow, fired a shot. The    bullet entered the body just below the right nipple.      As the Negro fell the crowd looked into his face and they discovered    then that the victim was very old. The young man who did the shooting    said: \"Oh, he is an old Negro. I'm sorry that I shot him.\"      This is all the old Negro received in the way of consolation.      He was left where he fell, but later staggered to his feet and made his    way to the third precinct station. There the police summoned the    ambulance and the students pronounced the wound very dangerous. He was    carried to the hospital as rapidly as possible.      There was no arrest.    Just before daybreak the mob found another victim. He, too, was on his way  to market, driving a meat wagon. But little is told of his treatment,  nothing more than the following brief statement:      At nearly 3 o'clock this morning a report was sent to the Third Precinct    station that a Negro was lying on the sidewalk at the corner of Decatur    and St. Philip. The man had been pulled off of a meat wagon and riddled    with bullets.      When the police arrived he was insensible and apparently dying. The    ambulance students attended the Negro and pronounced the wounds fatal.      There was nothing found which would lead to the discovery of his    identity.      +FUN IN GRETNA+    If there are any persons so deluded as to think that human life in the  South is valued any more than the life of a brute, he will be speedily  undeceived by reading the accounts of unspeakable barbarism committed by  the mob in and around New Orleans. In no other civilized country in the  world, nay, more, in no land of barbarians would it be possible to  duplicate the scenes of brutality that are reported from New Orleans. In  the heat of blind fury one might conceive how a mad mob might beat and  kill a man taken red-handed in a brutal murder. But it is almost past  belief to read that civilized white people, men who boast of their  chivalry and blue blood, actually had fun in beating, chasing and shooting  men who had no possible connection with any crime.    But this actually happened in Gretna, a few miles from New Orleans. In its  description of the scenes of Tuesday night, the _Picayune_ mentions the  brutal chase of several colored men whom the mob sought to kill. In the  instances mentioned, the paper said:      Gretna had its full share of excitement between 8 and 11 o'clock last    night, in connection with a report that spread through the town that a    Negro resembling the slayer of Police Captain Day, of New Orleans, had    been seen on the outskirts of the place.      It is true that a suspicious-looking Negro was observed by the residents    of Madison and Amelia Streets lurking about the fences of that    neighborhood just after dark, and shortly before 8 o'clock John Fist, a    young white man, saw the Negro on Fourth Street. He followed the darkey    a short distance, and, coming upon Robert Moore, who is known about town    as the \"black detective,\" Fist pointed the Negro out and Moore at once    made a move toward the stranger. The latter observed Moore making in his    direction, and, without a word, he sped in the direction of the Brooklyn    pasture, Moore following and firing several shots at him. In a few    minutes a half hundred white men, including Chief of Police Miller,    Constable Dannenhauer, Patrolman Keegan and several special officers,    all well-armed, joined in the chase, but in the darkness the Negro    escaped.      Just as the pursuing party reached town again, two of the residents of    Lafayette Avenue, Peter Leson and Robert Henning, reported that they had    just chased and shot at a Negro, who had been seen in the yard of the    former's house. They were positive the Negro had not escaped from the    square. Their report was enough to set the appetite of the crowd on    edge, and the square was quickly surrounded, while several dozens of    men, armed with lanterns and revolvers, made a search of every yard and    under every house in the square. No Negro was found.      The crowd of armed men was constantly swelling, and at 10 o'clock it had    reached the proportions of a small army. At 10:30 o'clock an outbound    freight train is due to pass through Gretna on the Texas and Pacific    Road, and the crowd, believing that Captain Day's slayer might be aboard    one of the cars attempting to leave the scene of his crime, resolved to    inspect the train. As the train stopped at the Madison Street crossing    the engineer was requested to pull very slowly through the town, in    order that the trucks of the cars might be examined. There was a string    of armed men on each side of the railroad track and in a few moments a    Negro was espied riding between two cars. A half dozen weapons were    pointed at him and he was ordered to come out. He sprang out with    alacrity and was pounced upon almost before he reached the ground.    Robert Moore grabbed him and pushed an ugly-looking Derringer under his    nose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#8)"],[1," crowd and the  bloodhound waited for the prisoner.    When the prisoner was on board _The Three States_ the dog was turned  loose, and after moving aimlessly around, followed the crowd to where  Miller sat handcuffed and there stopped. The crowd closed in on the pair  and insisted that the brute had identified him because of that action.  When the boat reached Wickliffe, Gordon, the fisherman, was called on to  say whether the prisoner was the man he ferried over the river the day of  the murder.    [Illustration: Lynching of C.J. Miller, at Bardwell, Kentucky, July 7,  1893.]    The sheriff of Ballard County informed him, sternly that if the prisoner  was not the man, he (the fisherman) would be held responsible as knowing  who the guilty man was. Gordon stated before, that the man he ferried  across was a white man or a bright colored man; Miller was a dark brown  skinned man, with kinky hair, \"neither yellow nor black,\" says the _Cairo  Evening Telegram_ of Friday, July 7. The fisherman went up to Miller from  behind, looked at him without speaking for fully five minutes, then slowly  said, \"Yes, that's the man I crossed over.\" This was about six o'clock,  Friday morning, and the crowd wished to hang Miller then and there. But  Mr. Ray, the father of the girls, insisted that he be taken to Bardwell,  the county seat of Ballard, and twelve miles inland. He said he thought a  white man committed the crime, and that he was not satisfied that was the  man. They took him to Bardwell and at ten o'clock, this same excited,  unauthorized mob undertook to determine Miller's guilt. One of the Clark  brothers who shot at a fleeing man in the Dupoyster cornfield, said the  prisoner was the same man; the other said he was not, but the testimony of  the first was accepted. A colored woman who had said she gave breakfast to  a colored man clad in a blue flannel suit the morning of the murder, said  positively that she had never seen Miller before. The gold rings found in  his possession had no names in them, as had been asserted, and Mr. Ray  said they did not belong to his daughters. Meantime a funeral pyre for the  purpose of burning Miller to death had been erected in the center of the  village. While the crowd swayed by passion was clamoring that he be burnt,  Miller stepped forward and made the following statement: \"My name is  C.J. Miller. I am from Springfield, Ill.; my wife lives at 716 N. 2d  Street. I am here among you today, looked upon as one of the most brutal  men before the people. I stand here surrounded by men who are excited, men  who are not willing to let the law take its course, and as far as the  crime is concerned, I have committed no crime, and certainly no crime  gross enough to deprive me of my life and liberty to walk upon the green  earth.\"    A telegram was sent to the chief of the police at Springfield, Ill.,  asking if one C.J. Miller lived there. An answer in the negative was  returned. A few hours after, it was ascertained that a man named Miller,  and his wife, did live at the number the prisoner gave in his speech, but  the information came to Bardwell too late to do the prisoner any good.  Miller was taken to jail, every stitch of clothing literally torn from his  body and examined again. On the lower left side of the bosom of his shirt  was found a dark reddish spot about the size of a dime. Miller said it was  paint which he had gotten on him at Jefferson Barracks. This spot was only  on the right side, and could not be seen from the under side at all, thus  showing it had not gone through the cloth as blood or any liquid substance  would do.    Chief-of-Police Mahaney, of Cairo, Ill., was with the prisoner, and he  took his knife and scraped at the spot, particles of which came off in his  hand. Miller told them to take his clothes to any expert, and if the spot  was shown to be blood, they might do anything they wished with him. They  took his clothes away and were gone some time. After a while they were  brought back and thrown into the cell without a word. It is needless to  say that if the spot had been found to be blood, that fact would have been  announced, and the shirt retained as evidence. Meanwhile numbers of rough,  drunken men crowded into the cell and tried to force a confession of the  deed from the prisoner's lips. He refused to talk save to reiterate his  innocence. To Mr. Mahaney, who talked seriously and kindly to him, telling  him the mob meant to burn and torture him at three o'clock, Miller said:  \"Burning and torture here lasts but a little while, but if I die with a  lie on my soul, I shall be tortured forever. I am innocent.\" For more than  three hours, all sorts of pressure in the way of threats, abuse and  urging, was brought to bear to force him to confess to the murder and thus  justify the mob in its deed of murder. Miller remained firm; but as the  hour drew near, and the crowd became more impatient, he asked for a  priest. As none could be procured, he then asked for a Methodist minister,  who came, prayed with the doomed man, baptized him and exhorted Miller to  confess. To keep up the flagging spirits of the dense crowd around the  jail, the rumor went out more than once, that Miller had confessed. But  the solemn assurance of the minister, chief-of-police, and leading  editor--who were with Miller all along--is that this rumor is absolutely  false.    At three o'clock the mob rushed to the jail to secure the prisoner. Mr.  Ray had changed his mind about the promised burning; he was still in doubt  as to the prisoner's guilt. He again addressed the crowd to that effect,  urging them not to burn Miller, and the mob heeded him so far, that they  compromised on hanging instead of burning, which was agreed to by Mr. Ray.  There was a loud yell, and a rush was made for the prisoner. He was  stripped naked, his clothing literally torn from his body, and his shirt  was tied around his loins. Some one declared the rope was a \"white man's  death,\" and a log-chain, nearly a hundred feet in length, weighing over  one hundred pounds, was placed round Miller's neck and body, and he was  led and dragged through the streets of the village in that condition  followed by thousands of people. He fainted from exhaustion several times,  but was supported to the platform where they first intended burning him.    The chain was hooked around his neck, a man climbed the telegraph pole and  the other end of the chain was passed up to him and made fast to the  cross-arm. Others brought a long forked stick which Miller was made to  straddle. By this means he was raised several feet from the ground and  then let fall. The first fall broke his neck, but he was raised in this  way and let fall a second time. Numberless shots were fired into the  dangling body, for most of that crowd were heavily armed, and had been  drinking all day.    Miller's body hung thus exposed from three to five o'clock, during which  time, several photographs of him as he hung dangling at the end of the  chain were taken, and his toes and fingers were cut off. His body was  taken down, placed on the platform, the torch applied, and in a few  moments there was nothing left of C.J. Miller save a few bones and ashes.  Thus perished another of the many victims of Lynch Law, but it is the  honest and sober belief of many who witnessed the scene that an innocent  man has been barbarously and shockingly put to death in the glare of the  nineteenth-century civilization, by those who profess to believe in  Christianity, law and order.          5    LYNCHED FOR ANYTHING OR NOTHING    (_Lynched for Wife Beating_)      In nearly all communities wife beating is punishable with a fine, and in  no community is it made a felony. Dave Jackson, of Abita, La., was a  colored man who had beaten his wife. He had not killed her, nor seriously  wounded her, but as Louisiana lynchers had not filled out their quota of  crimes, his case was deemed of sufficient importance to apply the method  of that barbarous people. He was in the custody of the officials, but the  mob went to the jail and took him out in front of the prison and hanged  him by the neck until he was dead. This was in Nov. 1893.      HANGED FOR STEALING HOGS    Details are very meagre of a lynching which occurred near Knox Point, La.,  on the twenty-fourth of October, 1893. Upon one point, however, there was  no uncertainty, and that is, that the persons lynched were Negroes. It was  claimed that they had been stealing hogs, but even this claim had not been  subjected to the investigation of a court. That matter was not considered  necessary. A few of the neighbors who had lost hogs suspected these men  were responsible for their loss, and made up their minds to furnish an  example for others to be warned by. The two men were secured by a mob and  hanged.      LYNCHED FOR NO OFFENSE    Perhaps the most characteristic feature of this record of lynch law for  the year 1893, is the remarkable fact that five human beings were lynched  and that the matter was considered of so little importance that the  powerful press bureaus of the country did not consider the matter of  enough importance to ascertain the causes for which they were hanged. It  tells the world, with perhaps greater emphasis than any other feature of  the record, that Lynch Law has become so common in the United States that  the finding of the dead body of a Negro, suspended between heaven and  earth to the limb of a tree, is of so slight importance that neither the  civil authorities nor press agencies consider the matter worth  investigating. July 21, in Shelby County, Tenn., a colored man by the name  of Charles Martin was lynched. July 30, at Paris, Mo., a colored man named  William Steen shared the same fate. December 28, Mack Segars was announced  to have been lynched at Brantley, Alabama. August 31, at Yarborough,  Texas, and on September 19, at Houston, a colored man was found lynched,  but so "]]]
