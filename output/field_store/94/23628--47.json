The spectacle of effort is what  awakens and sustains our own effort. No runner running all alone on a  race-track will find in his own will the power of stimulation which his  rivalry with other runners incites, when he feels them at his heels,  about to pass. When a trotting horse is 'speeded,' a running horse must  go beside him to keep him to the pace.    As imitation slides into emulation, so emulation slides into  _Ambition_; and ambition connects itself closely with _Pugnacity_ and  _Pride_. Consequently, these five instinctive tendencies form an  interconnected group of factors, hard to separate in the determination  of a great deal of our conduct. The _Ambitious Impulses_ would perhaps  be the best name for the whole group.    Pride and pugnacity have often been considered unworthy passions to  appeal to in the young. But in their more refined and noble forms they  play a great part in the schoolroom and in education generally, being in  some characters most potent spurs to effort. Pugnacity need not be  thought of merely in the form of physical combativeness. It can be taken  in the sense of a general unwillingness to be beaten by any kind of  difficulty. It is what makes us feel 'stumped' and challenged by arduous  achievements, and is essential to a spirited and enterprising character.  We have of late been hearing much of the philosophy of tenderness in  education; 'interest' must be assiduously awakened in everything,  difficulties must be smoothed away. _Soft_ pedagogics have taken the  place of the old steep and rocky path to learning. But from this  lukewarm air the bracing oxygen of effort is left out. It is nonsense  to suppose that every step in education _can_ be interesting. The  fighting impulse must often be appealed to. Make the pupil feel ashamed  of being scared at fractions, of being 'downed' by the law of falling  bodies; rouse his pugnacity and pride, and he will rush at the difficult  places with a sort of inner wrath at himself that is one of his best  moral faculties. A victory scored under such conditions becomes a  turning-point and crisis of his character. It represents the high-water  mark of his powers, and serves thereafter as an ideal pattern for his  self-imitation. The teacher who never rouses this sort of pugnacious  excitement in his pupils falls short of one of his best forms of  usefulness.    The next instinct which I shall mention is that of _Ownership_, also one  of the radical endowments of the race. It often is the antagonist of  imitation. Whether social progress is due more to the passion for  keeping old things and habits or to the passion of imitating and  acquiring new ones may in some cases be a difficult thing to decide. The  sense of ownership begins in the second year of life. Among the first  words which an infant learns to utter are the words 'my' and 'mine,'  and woe to the parents of twins who fail to provide their gifts in  duplicate. The depth and primitiveness of this instinct would seem to  cast a sort of psychological discredit in advance upon all radical forms  of communistic utopia. Private proprietorship cannot be practically  abolished until human nature is changed. It seems essential to mental  health that the individual should have something beyond the bare clothes  on his back to which he can assert exclusive possession, and which he  may defend adversely against the world. Even those religious orders who  make the most stringent vows of poverty have found it necessary to relax  the rule a little in favor of the human heart made unhappy by reduction  to too disinterested terms. The monk must have his books: the nun must  have her little garden, and the images and pictures in her room.    In education, the instinct of ownership is fundamental, and can be  appealed to in many ways. In the house, training in order and neatness  begins with the arrangement of the child's own personal possessions. In  the school, ownership is particularly important in connection with one  of its special forms of activity, the collecting impulse. An object  possibly not very interesting in itself, like a shell, a postage stamp,  or a single map or drawing, will acquire an interest if it fills a gap  in a collection or helps to complete a series. Much of the scholarly  work of the world, so far as it is mere bibliography, memory, and  erudition (and this lies at the basis of all our human scholarship),  would seem to owe its interest rather to the way in which it gratifies  the accumulating and collecting instinct than to any special appeal  which it makes to our cravings after rationality. A man wishes a  complete collection of information, wishes to know more about a subject  than anybody else, much as another may wish to own more dollars or more  early editions or more engravings before the letter than anybody else.    The teacher who can work this impulse into the school tasks is  fortunate. Almost all children collect something. A tactful teacher may  get them to take pleasure in collecting books; in keeping a neat and  orderly collection of notes; in starting, when they are mature enough, a  card catalogue; in preserving every drawing or map which they may make.  Neatness, order, and method are thus instinctively gained, along with  the other benefits which the possession of the collection entails. Even  such a noisome thing as a collection of postage stamps may be used by  the teacher as an inciter of interest in the geographical and historical  information which she desires to impart. Sloyd successfully avails  itself of this instinct in causing the pupil to make a collection of  wooden implements fit for his own private use at home. Collecting is, of  course, the basis of all natural history study; and probably nobody ever  became a good naturalist who was not an unusually active collector when  a boy.    _Constructiveness_ is another great instinctive tendency with which the  schoolroom has to contract an alliance. Up to the eighth or ninth year  of childhood one may say that the child does hardly anything else than  handle objects, explore things with his hands, doing and undoing,  setting up and knocking down, putting together and pulling apart; for,  from the psychological point of view, construction and destruction are  two names for the same manual activity. Both signify the production of  change, and the working of effects, in outward things. The result of all  this is that intimate familiarity with the physical environment, that  acquaintance with the properties of material things, which is really  the foundation of human _consciousness_. To the very last, in most of  us, the conceptions of objects and their properties are limited to the  notion of what we can _do with them_. A 'stick' means something we can  lean upon or strike with; 'fire,' something to cook, or warm ourselves,  or burn things up withal; 'string,' something with which to tie things  together. For most people these objects have no other meaning. In  geometry, the cylinder, circle, sphere, are defined as what you get by  going through certain processes of construction, revolving a  parallelogram upon one of its sides, etc. The more different kinds of  things a child thus gets to know by treating and handling them, the more  confident grows his sense of kinship with the world in which he lives.  An unsympathetic adult will wonder at the fascinated hours which a child  will spend in putting his blocks together and rearranging them. But the  wise education takes the tide at the flood, and from the kindergarten  upward devotes the first years of education to training in construction  and to object-teaching. I need not recapitulate here what I said awhile  back about the superiority of the objective and experimental methods.  They occupy the pupil in a way most congruous with the spontaneous  interests of his age. They absorb him, and leave impressions durable and  profound. Compared with the youth taught by these methods, one brought  up exclusively by books carries through life a certain remoteness from  reality: he stands, as it were, out of the pale, and feels that he  stands so; and often suffers a kind of melancholy from which he might  have been rescued by a more real education.    There are other impulses, such as love of approbation or vanity, shyness  and secretiveness, of which a word might be said; but they are too  familiar to need it. You can easily pursue the subject by your own  reflection. There is one general law, however, that relates to many of  our instinctive tendencies, and that has no little importance in  education; and I must refer to it briefly before I leave the subject. It  has been called the law of transitoriness in instincts. Many of our  impulsive tendencies ripen at a certain period; and, if the appropriate  objects be then and there provided, habits of conduct toward them are  acquired which last. But, if the objects be not forthcoming then, the  impulse may die out before a habit is formed; and later it may be hard  to teach the creature to react appropriately in those directions. The  sucking instincts in mammals, the following instinct in certain birds  and quadrupeds, are examples of this: they fade away shortly after  birth.    In children we observe a ripening of impulses and interests in a certain  determinate order. Creeping, walking, climbing, imitating vocal sounds,  constructing, drawing, calculating, possess the child in succession; and  in some children the possession, while it lasts, may be of a  semi-frantic and exclusive sort. Later, the interest in any one of these  things may wholly fade away. Of course, the proper pedagogic moment to  work skill in, and to clench the useful habit, is when the native  impulse"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#8)"],[1," of the first pada follow the order of passages in the  Chandogya Upanishad, and therefore call for no remark; with the  exception of the last adhikara/n/a, which refers to a Kaushitaki  passage, for whose being introduced in this place I am not able to  account.--The first adhikara/n/a of the second pada returns to the  Chandogya Upanishad. The second one treats of a passage in the Ka/th/a  Upanishad where a being is referred to which eats everything. The reason  why that passage is introduced in this place seems to be correctly  assigned in the /S/ri-bhashya, which remarks that, as in the preceding  Sutra it had been argued that the highest Self is not an enjoyer, a  doubt arises whether by that being which eats everything the highest  Self can be meant[10]--The third adhikara/n/a again, whose topic is the  'two entered into the cave' (Ka/th/a Up. I, 3, 1), appears, as Ramanuja  remarks, to come in at this place owing to the preceding adhikara/n/a;  for if it could not be proved that one of the two is the highest Self, a  doubt would attach to the explanation given above of the 'eater' since  the 'two entered into the cave,' and the 'eater' stand under the same  prakara/n/a, and must therefore be held to refer to the same  matter.--The fourth adhikara/n/a is again occupied with a Chandogya  passage.--The fifth adhikara/n/a, whose topic is the Ruler within  (antaryamin), manifestly owes its place, as remarked by Ramanuja also,  to the fact that the Vedic passage treated had been employed in the  preceding adhikara/n/a (I, 2, 14) for the purpose of strengthening the  argument [11].--The sixth adhikara/n/a, again, which discusses 'that  which is not seen' (adre/s/ya; Mu/nd/. Up. I, 1, 6), is clearly  introduced in this place because in the preceding adhikara/n/a it had  been said that ad/ri/sh/t/a, &c. denote the highest Self;--The reasons  to which the last adhikara/n/a of the second pada and the first and  third adhikara/n/as of the third pada owe their places are not apparent  (the second adhikara/n/a of the third pada treats of a Chandogya  passage). The introduction, on the other hand, of the passage from the  Pra/s/na Upanishad treating of the akshara. O/m/kara is clearly due to  the circumstance that an akshara, of a different nature, had been  discussed in the preceding adhikara/n/a.--The fifth and sixth  adhikara/n/as investigate Chandogya passages.--The two next Sutras (22,  23) are, as remarked above, considered by /S/a@nkara to constitute a new  adhikara/n/a treating of the 'being after which everything shines'  (Mu/nd/. Up. II, 2, 10); while Ramanuja looks on them as continuing the  sixth adhikara/n/a. There is one circumstance which renders it at any  rate probable that Ramanuja, and not /S/a@nkara, here hits the intention  of the author of the Sutras. The general rule in the first three padas  is that, wherever a new Vedic passage is meant to be introduced, the  subject of the discussion, i.e. that being which in the end is declared  to be Brahman is referred to by means of a special word, in most cases a  nominative form [12]. From this rule there is in the preceding part of  the adhyaya only one real exception, viz. in I, 2, 1, which possibly may  be due to the fact that there a new pada begins, and it therefore was  considered superfluous to indicate the introduction of a new topic by a  special word. The exception supplied by I, 3, 19 is only an apparent  one; for, as remarked above, Sutra 19 does not in reality begin a new  adhikara/n/a. A few exceptions occurring later on will be noticed in  their places.--Now neither Sutra 22 nor Sutra 23 contains any word  intimating that a new Vedic passage is being taken into consideration,  and hence it appears preferable to look upon them, with Ramanuja, as  continuing the topic of the preceding adhikara/n/a.--This conclusion  receives an additional confirmation from the position of the next  adhikara/n/a, which treats of the being 'a span long' mentioned in  Ka/th/a Up. II, 4, 12; for the reason of this latter passage being  considered here is almost certainly the reference to the alpa/s/ruti in  Sutra 21, and, if so, the a@ngush/th/amatra properly constitutes the  subject of the adhikara/n/a immediately following on Adhik. V, VI;  which, in its turn, implies that Sutras 22, 23 do not form an  independent adhikara/n/a.--The two next adhikara/n/as are digressions,  and do not refer to special Vedic passages.--Sutra 39 forms a new  adhikara/n/a, according to /S/a@nkara, but not according to Ramanuja,  whose opinion seems again to be countenanced by the fact that the Sutra  does not exhibit any word indicative of a new topic. The same difference  of opinion prevails with regard to Sutra 40, and it appears from the  translation of the Sutra given above, according to Ramanuja's view, that  'jyoti/h/' need not be taken as a nominative.--The last two  adhikara/n/as finally refer, according to Ramanuja, to one Chandogya  passage only, and here also we have to notice that Sutra 42 does not  comprise any word intimating that a new passage is about to be  discussed.    From all this we seem entitled to draw the following conclusions. The  Vedic passages discussed in the three first padas of the Vedanta-sutras  comprise all the doubtful--or at any rate all the more important  doubtful--passages from the Chandogya Upanishad. These passages are  arranged in the order in which the text of the Upanishad exhibits them.  Passages from other Upanishads are discussed as opportunities offer,  there being always a special reason why a certain Chandogya passage is  followed by a certain passage from some other Upanishad. Those reasons  can be assigned with sufficient certainty in a number of cases although  not in all, and from among those passages whose introduction cannot be  satisfactorily accounted for some are eliminated by our following the  subdivision of the Sutras into adhikara/n/as adopted by Ramanuja, a  subdivision countenanced by the external form of the Sutras.    The fourth pada of the first adhyaya has to be taken by itself. It is  directed specially and avowedly against Sa@nkhya-interpretations of  Scripture, not only in its earlier part which discusses isolated  passages, but also--as is brought out much more clearly in the  /S/ri-bhashya than by /S/a@nkara--in its latter part which takes a  general survey of the entire scriptural evidence for Brahman being the  material as well as the operative cause of the world.    Deussen (p. 221) thinks that the selection made by the Sutrakara of  Vedic passages setting forth the nature of Brahman is not in all cases  an altogether happy one. But this reproach rests on the assumption that  the passages referred to in the first adhyaya were chosen for the  purpose of throwing light on what Brahman is, and this assumption can  hardly be upheld. The Vedanta-sutras as well as the Purva  Mima/m/sa-sutras are throughout Mima/m/sa i.e. critical discussions of  such scriptural passages as on a prima facie view admit of different  interpretations and therefore necessitate a careful enquiry into their  meaning. Here and there we meet with Sutras which do not directly  involve a discussion of the sense of some particular Vedic passage, but  rather make a mere statement on some important point. But those cases  are rare, and it would be altogether contrary to the general spirit of  the Sutras to assume that a whole adhyaya should be devoted to the task  of showing what Brahman is. The latter point is sufficiently determined  in the first five (or six) adhikara/n/as; but after we once know what  Brahman is we are at once confronted by a number of Upanishad passages  concerning which it is doubtful whether they refer to Brahman or not.  With their discussion all the remaining adhikara/n/as of the first  adhyaya are occupied. That the Vedanta-sutras view it as a particularly  important task to controvert the doctrine of the Sa@nkhyas is patent  (and has also been fully pointed out by Deussen, p. 23). The fifth  adhikara/n/a already declares itself against the doctrine that the world  has sprung from a non-intelligent principle, the pradhana, and the  fourth pada of the first adhyaya returns to an express polemic against  Sa@nkhya interpretations of certain Vedic statements. It is therefore  perhaps not saying too much if we maintain that the entire first adhyaya  is due to the wish, on the part of the Sutrakara, to guard his own  doctrine against Sa@nkhya attacks. Whatever the attitude of the other  so-called orthodox systems may be towards the Veda, the Sa@nkhya system  is the only one whose adherents were anxious--and actually attempted--to  prove that their views are warranted by scriptural passages. The  Sa@nkhya tendency thus would be to show that all those Vedic texts which  the Vedantin claims as teaching the existence of Brahman, the  intelligent and sole cause of the world, refer either to the pradhana or  some product of the pradhana, or else to the purusha in the Sankhya  sense, i.e. the individual soul. It consequently became the task of the  Vedantin to guard the Upanishads against misinterpretations of the kind,  and this he did in the first adhyaya of the Vedanta-sutras, selecting  those passages about whose interpretation doubts were, for some reason  or other, likely to arise. Some of the passages singled out are  certainly obscure, and hence liable to various interpretations; of  others it is less apparent why it was thought requisite to discuss them  at length. But this is hardly a matter in which we are entitled to find  fault with the Sutrakara; for no modern scholar, either European or  Hindu, is--or can possibly be--sufficiently at home, on the one hand, in  the religious and philosophical views which prevailed at the time when  the Sutras may have been composed, and, on the other hand, in the  intricacies of the Mima/m/sa, to judge with confidence which Vedic  passages may give rise to discussions and"]]]
