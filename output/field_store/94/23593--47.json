That is the  right kind of preaching for Gentiles.\"        VERSE 16. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.    Once Paul had received the Gospel from Christ, he conferred with nobody  in Damascus. He asked no man to teach him. He did not go up to Jerusalem  to sit at the feet of Peter and the other apostles. At once he preached  Jesus Christ in Damascus.        VERSE 17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were    apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto    Damascus.    \"I went to Arabia before I saw any of the apostles. I took it upon  myself to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles without delay, because  Christ had called me for that purpose.\" This statement refutes the  assertion of the false apostles that Paul had been a pupil of the  apostles, from which the false apostles inferred that Paul had been  instructed in the obedience of the Law, that therefore the Gentiles also  ought to keep the Law and submit to circumcision.        VERSES 18, 19. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see    Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles    saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.    Paul minutely recounts his personal history to stop the cavil of the  false apostles. Paul does not deny that he had been with some of the  apostles. He went to Jerusalem uninvited, not to be instructed, but to  visit with Peter. Luke reports the occasion in the ninth chapter of the  Book of Acts. Barnabas introduced Paul to the apostles and related to  them how Paul had met the Lord Jesus on the way to Damascus, also how  Paul had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. Paul says  that he saw Peter and James, but he denies that he learned anything from  them.    Why does Paul harp on this seemingly unimportant fact? To convince the  churches of Galatia that his Gospel was the true Word of Christ which he  learned from Christ Himself and from no man. Paul was forced to affirm  and re-affirm this fact. His usefulness to all the churches that had  used him as their pastor and teacher was at stake.        VERSE 20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God,    I lie not.    Was it necessary for Paul to go under oath? Yes. Paul is reporting  personal history. How else would the churches believe him? The false  apostles might say, \"Who knows whether Paul is telling the truth?\"  Paul, the elect vessel of God, was held in so little esteem by his own  Galatians to whom he had preached Christ that it was necessary for him  to swear an oath that he spoke the truth. If this happened to Paul, what  business have we to complain when people doubt our words, or hold us  in little regard, we who cannot begin to compare ourselves with the  Apostle?        VERSE 21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.    Syria and Cilicia are adjacent countries. Paul traces his movements  carefully in order to convince the Galatians that he had never been the  disciple of any apostle.        VERSES 22, 23, 24. And was unknown by face unto the churches of    Judaea which were in Christ: But they had heard only, that he which    persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he    destroyed. And they glorified God in me.    In Syria and Cilicia Paul won the indorsement of all the churches of  Judea, by his preaching. All the churches everywhere, even those of  Judea, could testify that he had preached the same faith everywhere.  \"And,\" Paul adds, \"these churches glorified God in me, not because I  taught that circumcision and the law of Moses should be observed, but  because I urged upon all faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\"          CHAPTER 2        VERSE 1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem.    Paul taught justification by faith in Christ Jesus, without the deeds  of the Law. He reported this to the disciples at Antioch. Among the  disciples were some that had been brought up in the ancient customs of  the Jews. These rose against Paul in quick indignation, accusing him of  propagating a gospel of lawlessness.    Great dissension followed. Paul and Barnabas stood up for the truth.  They testified: \"Wherever we preached to the Gentiles, the Holy Ghost  came upon those who received the Word. This happened everywhere. We  preached not circumcision, we did not require observance of the Law. We  preached faith in Jesus Christ. At our preaching of faith, God gave to  the hearers the Holy Ghost.\" From this fact Paul and Barnabas inferred  that the Holy Ghost approved the faith of the Gentiles without the Law  and circumcision. If the faith of the Gentiles had not pleased the Holy  Ghost, He would not have manifested His presence in the uncircumcised  hearers of the Word.    Unconvinced, the Jews fiercely opposed Paul, asserting that the Law  ought to be kept and that the Gentiles ought to be circumcised, or else  they could not be saved.    When we consider the obstinacy with which Romanists cling to their  traditions, we can very well understand the zealous devotion of the  Jews for the Law. After all, they had received the Law from God. We  can understand how impossible it was for recent converts from Judaism  suddenly to break with the Law. For that matter, God did bear with them,  as He bore with the infirmity of Israel when the people halted  between two religions. Was not God patient with us also while we were  blindfolded by the papacy? God is longsuffering and full of mercy. But  we dare not abuse the patience of the Lord. We dare no longer continue  in error now that the truth has been revealed in the Gospel. The  opponents of Paul had his own example to prefer against him. Paul had  circumcised Timothy. Paul defended his action on the ground that he had  circumcised Timothy, not from compulsion, but from Christian love, lest  the weak in faith should be offended. His opponents would not accept  Paul's explanation.    When Paul saw that the quarrel was getting out of hand he obeyed the  direction of God and left for Jerusalem, there to confer with the other  apostles. He did this not for his own sake, but for the sake of the  people.        VERSE 1. With Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.    Paul chose two witnesses, Barnabas and Titus. Barnabas had been Paul's  preaching companion to the Gentiles. Barnabas was an eye-witness of the  fact that the Holy Ghost had come upon the Gentiles in response to the  simple preaching of faith in Jesus Christ. Barnabas stuck to Paul on  this point, that it was not necessary for the Gentiles to be bothered  with the Law as long as they believed in Christ.    Titus was superintendent of the churches in Crete, having been placed in  charge of the churches by Paul. Titus was a former Gentile.        VERSE 2. And I went up by revelation.    If God had not ordered Paul to Jerusalem, Paul would never have gone  there.        VERSE 2. And communicated unto them that gospel.    After an absence of fourteen years, respectively eighteen years, Paul  returned to Jerusalem to confer with the other apostles.        VERSE 2. Which I preach among the Gentiles.    Among the Jews Paul allowed Law and circumcision to stand for the time  being. So did all the apostles. Nevertheless Paul held fast to the  liberty of the Gospel. On one occasion he said to the Jews: \"Through  this man (Christ) is preached unto you forgiveness of sins; and by him  all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not  be justified by the law of Moses.\" (Acts 13:39.) Always remembering the  weak, Paul did not insist that they break at once with the Law.    Paul admits that he conferred with the apostles concerning his Gospel.  But he denies that the conference benefited or taught him anything. The  fact is he resisted those who wanted to force the practice of the Law  upon the Gentiles. They did not overcome him, he overcame them. \"Your  false apostles lie, when they say that I circumcised Timothy, shaved  my head in Cenchrea, and went up to Jerusalem, at the request of the  apostles. I went to Jerusalem at the request of God. What is more, I won  the indorsement of the apostles. My opponents lost out.\"    The matter upon which the apostles deliberated in conference was  this: Is the observance of the Law requisite unto justification? Paul  answered: \"I have preached faith in Christ to the Gentiles, and not the  Law. If the Jews want to keep the Law and be circumcised, very well, as  long as they do so from a right motive.\"        VERSE 2. But privately to them which were of reputation.    This is to say, \"I conferred not only with the brethren, but with the  leaders among them.\"        VERSE 2. Lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.    Not that Paul himself ever thought he had run in vain. However, many  did think that Paul had preached the Gospel in vain, because he kept the  Gentiles free from the yoke of the Law. The opinion that obedience to  the Law was mandatory unto salvation was gaining ground. Paul meant to  remedy this evil. By this conference he hoped to establish the identity  of his Gospel with that of the other apostles, to stop the talk of his  opponents that he had been running around in vain.        VERSE 3. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was    compelled to be circumcised.    The word \"compelled\" acquaints us with the outcome of the conference.  It was resolved that the Gentiles should not be compelled to be  circumcised.    Paul did not condemn circumcision in itself. Neither by word nor deed  did he ever inveigh against circumcision. But he did protest against  circumcision being made a condition for salvation. He cited the case of  the Fathers. \"The fathers were not justified by circumcision. It was to  them a sign and seal of righteousness. They looked upon circumcision as  a confession of their faith.\"    The believing Jews, however, could not get it through their heads that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#8)"],[1,"METHODS    \"But when I came to Franz Kneisel, my last teacher, I began to work with  my mind. Kneisel showed me that I had to think when I played. At first I  did not realize why he kept at me so insistently about phrasing,  interpretation, the exact observance of expression marks; but eventually  it dawned on me that he was teaching me to read a soul into each  composition I studied.    \"I practiced hard, from four to five hours a day. Fortunately, as  regards technical equipment, I was ready for Kneisel's instruction. The  first thing he gave me to study was, not a brilliant virtuoso piece, but  the Bach concerto in E major, and then the Viotti concerto. In the  beginning, until Kneisel showed me, I did not know what to do with them.  This was music whose notes in themselves were easy, and whose  difficulties were all of an individual order. But intellectual analysis,  interpretation, are Kneisel's great points. A strict teacher, I worked  with him for five years, the most remarkable years of all my violin  study.    \"Kneisel knows how to develop technical perfection without using  technical exercises. I had already played the Mendelssohn, Bruch and  Lalo concertos with Winternitz, and these I now restudied with Kneisel.  In interpretation he makes clear every phrase in its relation to every  other phrase and the movement as a whole. And he insists on his pupils  studying theory and composition--something I had formerly not been  inclined to take seriously.    \"Some teachers are satisfied if the student plays his _notes_ correctly,  in a general way. With Kneisel the very least detail, a trill, a scale,  has to be given its proper tone-color and dynamic shading in absolute  proportion with the balancing harmonies. This trill, in the first  movement of the Beethoven concerto--(and Mr. Gardner jotted it down)                        [Illustration: Musical Notation]    Kneisel kept me at during the entire lesson, till I was able to adjust  its tone-color and _nuances_ to the accompanying harmony. Then, though  many teachers do not know it, it is a tradition in the orchestra to make  a _diminuendo_ in the sixth measure, before the change of key to C  major, and this _diminuendo_ should, of course, be observed by the solo  instrument as well. Yet you will hear well-known artists play the trill  throughout with a loud, brilliant tone and no dynamic change!    \"Kneisel makes it a point to have all his pupils play chamber music  because of its truly broadening influence. And he is unexcelled in  taking apart structurally the Beethoven, Brahms, Tschaikovsky and other  quartets, in analyzing and explaining the wonderful planning and  building up of each movement. I had the honor of playing second violin  in the Kneisel Quartet from September to February (1914-1915), at the  outbreak of the war, a most interesting experience. The musicianship  Kneisel had given me; I was used to his style and at home with his  ideas, and am happy to think that he was satisfied. A year later as  assistant concertmaster in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, I had a  chance to become practically acquainted with the orchestral works of  Strauss, d'Indy and other moderns, and enjoy the Beethoven, Brahms and  Tschaikovsky symphonies as a performer.                              TECHNIC AND MUSICIANSHIP    \"How do I regard technic now? I think of it in the terms of the music  itself. Music should dictate the technical means to be used. The  composition and its phrases should determine bowing and the tone quality  employed. One should not think of down-bows or up-bows. In the Brahms  concerto you can find many long phrases: they cannot be played with one  bow; yet there must be no apparent change of bow. If the player does not  know what the phrase means; how to interpret it, how will he be able to  bow it correctly?    \"And there are so many different _nuances_, especially in _legato_. It  is as a rule produced by a slurred bow; yet it may also be produced by  other bowings. To secure a good _legato_ tone watch the singer. The  singer can establish the perfect smoothness that _legato_ calls for to  perfection. To secure a like effect the violinist should convey the  impression that there is no point, no frog, that the bow he uses is of  indefinite length. And the violinist should never think: 'I must play  this up-bow or down-bow.' Artists of the German school are more apt to  begin a phrase with a down-bow; the French start playing a good deal at  the point. Up or down, both are secondary to finding out, first of all,  what quality, what balance of tone the phrase demands. The conductor of  a symphonic orchestra does not care how, technically, certain effects  are produced by the violins, whether they use an up-bow or a down-bow.  He merely says: 'That's too heavy: give me less tone!' The result to be  achieved is always more important than the manner of achievement.    \"All phases of technical accomplishment, if rightly acquired, tend to  become second nature to the player in the course of time: _staccato_, a  brilliant trick; _spiccato_, the reiteration of notes played from the  wrist, etc. The _martellato_, a _nuance_ of _spiccato_, should be played  with a firm bowing at the point. In a very broad _spiccato_, the arm  may be brought into play; but otherwise not, since it makes rapid  playing impossible. Too many amateurs try to play _spiccato_ from the  arm. And too many teachers are contented with a trill that is merely  brilliant. Kneisel insists on what he calls a 'musical trill,' of which  Kreisler's beautiful trill is a perfect example. The trill of some  violinists is _invariably_ brilliant, whether brilliancy is appropriate  or not. Brilliant trills in Bach always seem out of place to me; while  in Paganini and in Wieniawski's _Carnaval de Venise_ a high brilliant  trill is very effective.    \"As to double-stops--Edison once said that violin music should be  written only in double-stops--I practice them playing first the single  notes and then the two together, and can recommend this mode of practice  from personal experience. Harmonics, where clarity is the most important  thing, are mainly a matter of bowing, of a sure attack and sustaining by  the bow. Of course the harmonics themselves are made by the fingers; but  their tone quality rests altogether with the bow.                                EDISON AND OCTAVES    \"The best thing I've ever heard said of octaves was Edison's remark to  me that 'They are merely a nuisance and should not be played!' I was  making some records for him during the experimental stage of the disk  record, when he was trying to get an absolutely smooth _legato_ tone,  one that conformed to Loeffler's definition of it as 'no breaks' in the  tone. He had had Schubert's _Ave Maria_ recorded by Flesch, MacMillan  and others, and wanted me to play it for him. The records were all  played for me, and whenever he came to the octave passages Edison would  say: 'Listen to them! How badly they sound!' Yet the octaves were  absolutely in tune! 'Why do they sound so badly?' I inquired.    \"Then Edison explained to me that according to the scientific theory of  vibration, the vibrations of the higher tone of the octaves should be  exactly twice those of the lower note. 'But here,' he continued, 'the  vibrations of the notes all vary.' 'Yet how can the player control his  fingers in the _vibrato_ beyond playing his octaves in perfect tune?' I  asked. 'Well, if he cannot do so,' said Edison, 'octaves are merely a  nuisance, and should not be played at all.' I experimented and found  that by simply pressing down the fingers and playing without any  _vibrato_, I could come pretty near securing the exact relation between  the vibrations of the upper and lower notes but--they sounded dreadful!  Of course, octaves sound well in _ensemble_, especially in the  orchestra, because each player plays but a single note. And tenths sound  even better than octaves when two people play them.                                WIRE AND GUT STRINGS    \"You ask about my violin? It belonged to the famous Hawley collection,  and is a Giovanni Baptista Guadignini, made in 1780, in Turin. The back  is a single piece of maple-wood, having a broadish figure extending  across its breadth. The maple-wood sides match the back. The top is  formed of a very choice piece of spruce, and it is varnished a deep  golden-red. It has a remarkably fine tone, very vibrant and with great  carrying power, a tone that has all that I can ask for as regards volume  and quality.    \"I think that wire strings are largely used now-a-days because gut  strings are hard to obtain--not because they are better. I do not use  wire strings. I have tried them and find them thin in tone, or so  brilliant that their tone is too piercing. Then, too, I find that the  use of a wire E reduces the volume of tone of the other strings. No  wire string has the quality of a fine gut string; and I regard them only  as a substitute in the case of some people, and a convenience for lazy  ones.                                  VIOLIN MASTERY    \"Violin Mastery? Off-hand I might say the phrase stands for a life-time  of effort with its highest aims unattained. As I see it the achievement  of violin mastery represents a combination of 90 per cent. of toil and  10 per cent. of talent or inspiration. Goetschius, with whom I studied  composition, once said to me: 'I do not congratulate you on having  talent. That is a gift. But I do congratulate you on being able to work  hard!' The same thing applies to the fiddle. It seems to me that only by  keeping everlastingly at it can one become a master of the instrument.\"                                             VI                                  ARTHUR HARTMANN                            THE PROBLEM OF TECHNIC      Arthur Hartmann is distinctly and unmistakably a personality.
