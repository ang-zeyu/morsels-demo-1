Take 2 oz. of gum sandarach, 1 oz. of litharge of gold, and 4 oz. of  clarified linseed oil, which boil in a glazed earthenware vessel till  the contents appear of a transparent yellow colour. This will make a  good varnish for the final coating for enamelled and japanned goods.      CARRIAGE VARNISH.    The following is used for the wheels, springs, and carriage parts of  coaches and other vehicles: Take of pale African copal 8 lb.; fuse,  and add 2-1/2 gallons of clarified linseed oil; boil until very  stringy, then add 1/4 lb. each of dry copperas and litharge; boil, and  thin with 5-1/2 gallons of turpentine; then mix while hot with the  following varnish, and immediately strain the mixture into a covered  vessel. Gum anime, 8 lb.; clarified linseed oil, 2-1/2 gallons; 1/4  lb. each of dried sugar of lead and litharge; boil, and thin with  5-1/2 gallons of turpentine; and mix it while hot as above directed.  Of course these quantities will only do for big jobs, and as it has to  do with metal, it has been thought advisable to include the formula in  this handbook.      METAL POLISHES.    The active constituent of all metal polishes is generally chalk,  rouge, or tripoli, because these produce a polish on metallic  surfaces. The following recipes give good polishing soaps:--    (1) 20 to 25 lb. liquid soap is intimately mixed with about 80 lb. of  Swedish chalk and 1/2 lb. Pompeiian red. (2) 25 lb. liquid coco-nut  oil soap is mixed with 2 lb. tripoli, and 1 lb. each alum, tartaric  acid, and white lead. (3) 25 lb. liquid coco-nut oil soap is mixed  with 5 lb. rouge and 1 lb. ammonium carbonate. (4) 24 lb. coco-nut oil  are saponified with 12 lb. soda lye of 38 deg. to 40 deg. B., after which 3  lb. rouge, 3 lb. water, and 32 grammes ammonia are mixed in. Good  recipes for polishing pomades are as follows: (1) 5 lb. lard and  yellow vaseline is melted and mixed with 1 lb. fine rouge. (2) 2 lb.  palm oil and 2 lb. vaseline are melted together, and then 1 lb. rouge,  400 grains tripoli, and 20 grains oxalic acid are stirred in. (3) 4  lb. fatty petroleum and 1 lb. lard are heated and mixed with 1 lb. of  rouge. The polishing pomades are generally perfumed with essence of  myrbane. Polishing powders are prepared as follows: (1) 4 lb.  magnesium carbonate, 4 lb. chalk, and 7 lb. rouge are intimately  mixed. (2) 4 lb. magnesium carbonate are mixed with 150 grains fine  rouge. An excellent and harmless polishing water is prepared by  shaking together 250 grains floated chalk, 1 lb. alcohol, and 20  grains ammonia. Gilded articles are most readily cleansed with a  solution of 5 grains borax in 100 parts water, by means of a sponge or  soft brush. The articles are then washed in pure water, and dried with  a soft linen rag. Silverware is cleansed by rubbing with a solution of  sodium hyposulphite.      BLACK PAINTS.    Carbon, in one form or another, is the base of all black pigments. By  far the most common of these, as used in structural plants, is  graphite. Other black pigments are lamp-black (including carbon black)  and bone-black, the former being produced in many grades, varying in  price from twopence to half a crown per pound. Bone-black, which is  refuse from the sugar-house black, varies in the percentage of carbon  contained, which is usually about 10 or 12 per cent, the remainder  being the mineral matter originally present in the bone, and  containing 3 or 4 per cent of carbonate, whilst most of the remainder  is phosphate of lime. Lamp-black is an absolutely impalpable powder,  which having a small amount of greasy matter in it, greatly retards  the drying of the oil with which it may be mixed. For this reason it  is not used by itself, but is added in small quantity to other paints,  which it affects by changing their colour, and probably their  durability. For example, it is a common practice to add it to red  lead, in order to tone down its brilliant colour, and also to correct  the tendency it has to turn white, due to the conversion of the red  oxide of lead into the carbonate.      BLACK STAIN FOR IRON.    For colouring iron and steel a dead black of superior appearance and  permanency, the following is a good formula: 1 part bismuth chloride,  2 parts mercury bi-chloride, 1 part copper chloride, 6 parts  hydrochloric acid, 5 parts alcohol, and 50 parts lamp-black, these  being all well mixed. To use this preparation successfully--the  article to be blacked or bronzed being first made clean and free from  grease--it is applied with a swab or brush, or, better still, the  object may be dipped into it; the liquid is allowed to dry on the  metal, and the latter is then placed in boiling water, the temperature  being maintained for half an hour. If, after this, the colour is not  so dark as is desired, the operation has simply to be repeated, and  the result will be found satisfactory. After obtaining the desired  degree of colour, the latter is fixed, as well as much improved  generally, by placing for a few minutes in a bath of boiling oil, or  by coating the surface with oil, and heating the object till the oil  is completely driven off The intense black obtained by this method is  admirable.    Another black coating for ironwork, which is really a lacquer, is  obtained by melting ozokerite, which becomes a brown resinous mass,  with a melting-point at 140 deg. F. The melted mass is then further heated  to 212 deg. F., the boiling-point of water. The objects to be lacquered  are scoured clean by rubbing with dry sand, and are dipped in the  melted mass. They are then allowed to drip, and the ozokerite is  ignited by the objects being held over a fire. After the ozokerite has  burned away, the flame is extinguished, and the iron acquires a firmly  adhering black coating, which resists atmospheric influences, as well  as acids and alkalies. If the black iron vessels are to contain  alkaline liquids, the above operation is repeated.    A good cheap stock black paint or varnish for ironwork is prepared, as  follows: Clear (solid) wood tar, 10 lb.; lamp black or mineral black,  1-1/4 lb.; oil of turpentine, 5-1/2 quarts. The tar is first heated in  a large iron pot to boiling-point, or nearly so, and the heat is  continued for about 4 hours. The pot is then removed from the fire out  of doors, and while still warm, and not hot, the turpentine, mixed  with the black, is stirred in. If the varnish is too thick to dry  quickly, add more turpentine. Benzine can be used instead of  turpentine, but the results are not so good. Asphaltum is preferable  to the cheap tar.    To make another good black varnish for ironwork, take 8 lb. of  asphaltum and fuse it in an iron kettle, then add 2 gallons of boiled  linseed oil, 1 lb. of litharge, 1/2 lb. of sulphate of zinc (add these  slowly, or the mixture will boil over), and boil them for about 3  hours. Then, add 1-1/2 lb. of dark gum amber, and boil for 2 hours  longer, or until the mass will become quite thick when cool. After  this it should be thinned with turpentine to the proper consistency.      VARNISHES FOR IRONWORK.    A reliable authority gives the following as a very good recipe for  ironwork varnish. Take 2 lb. of tar oil, 1/2 lb. of pounded resin, and  1/2 lb. of asphaltum, and dissolve together, and then mix while hot in  an iron kettle, taking all care to prevent the flames getting into  contact with the mixture. When cold the varnish is ready for  application to outdoor ironwork. Another recipe is to take 3 lb. of  powdered resin, place it in a tin or iron vessel, and add thereto  2-1/2 pints of spirits of turpentine, which well shake, and then let  it stand for a day or two, giving it an occasional shake. Then add to  it 5 quarts of boiled oil, shake it thoroughly well all together,  afterwards letting it stand in a warm room till it gets clear. The  clear portion can then be drawn off and used, or reduced with spirits  of turpentine till of the requisite consistency. For making a varnish  suitable for iron patterns, take sufficient oil of turpentine for the  purpose of the job in hand, and drop into it, drop by drop, some  strong commercial oil of vitriol, when the acid will cause a dark  syrupy precipitate in the oil of turpentine, and continue to add the  drops of vitriol till the precipitate ceases to act, after which pour  off the liquid and wash the syrupy mass with water, when it will be  ready for use. When the iron pattern is to be varnished, it must be  heated to a gentle degree, the syrupy product applied, and then the  article allowed to dry.    A fine black varnish suitable for the covering of broken places in  sewing machines and similar articles, where the japanned surface has  become injured or scratched, can be made by taking some fine  lamp-black or ivory-black, and thoroughly mixing it with copal  varnish. The black must be in a very fine powder, and to mix the more  readily it should be made into a pasty mass with turpentine. For the  ordinary repairing shop this will be found very handy.    The following is a simple way for tarring sheet-iron pipes to prevent  rusting. The sections as made should be coated with coal tar, and then  filled with light wood shavings, and the latter set alight. The effect  of this treatment will be to render the iron practically proof against  rust for an indefinite period, rendering future painting unnecessary.  It is important, of course, that the iron should not be made too hot,  or kept hot for too long a time, lest the tar should be burnt off.    The following is a varnish for iron and steel given by a recognized  authority: 5 parts of camphor and elemi, 15 parts of sandarach, and  10 parts of clear grains of mastic, are dissolved in the requisite  quantity of alcohol, and applied cold.    Another good black enamel for small articles can be made by mixing 1  lb. of asphaltum with 1 lb. of resin in 4 lb. of tar oil, well heating  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#8)"],[1,"flared like a thoroughbred horse, his face turned  this way and that, his eyes drinking deep, satisfying draughts of a  beauty such as he had never before known. His lips were parted a  little, half smiling at the wonderful kindness of fate, that had  picked him up and set him away up here at the top o' the world.    He glanced downward, to his right. There went two objects--three, he  counted them a moment later. He stepped inside, snatched up the  telescope and focussed it eagerly on the slow-moving, black specks.  Why, there went Hank Brown and the fireman, Ed somebody, and the pack  horse with Ed's bedding lashed on its back. For perhaps a mile he  watched them going down through the manzanita and buck brush toward  the massed line of balsam firs that marked the nearest edge of the  heavy timber line.    So that was the trail that led up to his eyrie! He marked it well,  thinking that it might be a good plan to keep an eye on that trail, in  case an officer came looking for him here.    He watched Hank and Ed go down into the balsam firs. Dark shadows  crept after them down the slope to the edge of the thicket where they  had disappeared.    He watched the shadows until they gave him a vague feeling of  discomfort and loneliness. He turned away and looked down into the  bottom of the mountain's cup. The lake lay darkling there, hooded with  shadows like a nun, the snow banks at the edge indicating the band of  white against the calm face. It looked cold and lonesome down there;  terribly cold and lonesome.    Mount Lassen, when he sent a comfort-seeking glance that way, sent up  a spurt of grayish black smoke with a vicious suddenness that made him  jump. With bulging eyes he watched it mount higher and higher until he  held his breath in fear that it would never stop. He saw the column  halt and spread and fall....    When it was over he became conscious of itching palms where his nails  had dug into them and left little red marks. He discovered that he was  shaking as with a nervous chill, and that his knees were bending under  him. He sent a wild-eyed glance to the still, purple lake down there  where the snowbanks lingered, though it was the middle of May; to the  far hills that were purpling already with the dropping of the sun  behind the high peaks; to the manzanita slope where the trail lay in  shadow now. It was terribly still and empty--this piled wilderness.    He turned and hurried into his little glass-sided house and shut the  door behind him. A red beam of the sinking sun shone in and laid a bar  of light across the chart like a grin.    The silence was terrible. The emptiness pressed upon him like a weight  that crushed from him his youth and his strength and all his youthful  optimism, and left him old and weak and faded, a shadow of humanity  like those shadows down there in the canyon.    Stealthily, as if he were afraid of some tangible shape reaching out  of the silence, his hand went to the telephone receiver. He clutched  it as drowning fingers clutch at seaweed. He leaned and jerked the  receiver to his ear, and waited for the human voice that would bring  him once more into the world of men. He did not know then that the  telephone was the kind that must be rung by the user; or if he had  been told that he had forgotten. So he waited, his ears strained to  catch the heavenly sound of a human voice.    Shame crept in on the panic of his soul; shame and something that  stiffened it into the courage of a man. He felt his cheeks burn with  the flush that stained them, and he slowly lowered the receiver into  its hook.    With his hands thrust deep into his pockets and his mouth pulled down  at the corners, he stood leaning back against the desk shelf and  forced himself to look down across the wooded slopes to the valley,  where a light twinkled now like a fallen star. After a while he found  that he could see once more the beauty, and not so much the  loneliness. Then, just to prove to himself that he was not going to be  bluffed by the silence, he began to whistle. And the tune carried  with it an impish streak of that grim humor in which, so they tell  us, the song was born. It is completely out of date now, that song,  but then it was being sung around the world. And sometimes it was  whistled just as Jack was whistling it now, to brace a man's courage  against the press of circumstances.    \"It's a long way to Tipperary,\" sang Jack, when he had whistled the  chorus twice; and grinned at the joke upon himself. After that he  began to fuss with the oil stove and to experiment with the food they  had left him, and whistled deliberately all the while.    In this wise Jack Corey lost himself from his world and entered into  his exile on a mountain top.          CHAPTER SIX    MISS ROSE FORWARD      Times were none too prosperous with the Martha Washington Beauty Shop,  upon the sixth floor of a Broadway building. In the hairdressing  parlor half the long rows of chairs reached out empty arms except  during the rush hours of afternoon; even then impatient patrons merely  sprinkled the room with little oases of activity while the girls  busied themselves with tidying shelves already immaculate, and  prinking before the mirrors whenever they dared. An air of uncertainty  pervaded the place, swept in by the rumor that the shop was going to  cut down its force of operators. No one knew, of course, the exact  truth of the matter, but that made it all the worse.    \"'For one shall be taken and the other left,'\" a blonde girl quoted  into a dismal little group at the window that looked out over the  city. \"Has any one heard any more about it?\"    \"Rumley has been checking up the appointment lists, all morning,\" a  short, fat girl with henna-auburn hair piled high on her head reported  cheerfully. \"Of course, you could never get a word out of _her_--but  I know what she is up to. The girls that have the most steady patrons  will stay, of course. I'm certainly glad I kidded that old widow into  thinking she's puhfectly stunning with her hair hennaed. She don't  trust anybody but me to touch it up. And she's good for a scalp and  facial and manicure every week of her life, besides getting her hair  dressed every Saturday anyway, and sometimes oftener when she's going  out. And she _always_ has a marcelle after a shampoo. She'd quit  coming if I left--she told me so last week. She thinks I'm _there_ on  massages. And then I've got sevrul others that ask for me regular as  they come in. You know that big, fat--\"    \"Miss Rose forward,\" the foreman's crisp, businesslike voice  interrupted.    Miss Rose began nervously pulling her corn-colored hair into the  latest plastered effect on her temples. \"This isn't any appointment. I  wonder if somebody asked for me, or if Rumley--\"    \"Well, kid her along, whoever she is, and talk a lot about her good  points. You never can tell when some old girl is going to pull a lot  of patronage your way,\" the fat girl advised practically. \"Tell 'em  your name and suggest that they call for you next time. You've got to  get wise to the trick of holding what you get. Beat it, kiddo--being  slow won't help you none with Rumley, and she's got the axe,  remember.\"    Thus adjured, Miss Rose beat it, arriving rather breathlessly at her  chair, which was occupied by a rather sprightly looking woman with  pretty hands and a square jaw and hair just beginning to gray over the  temples. She had her hat off and was regarding herself seriously in  the mirror, wondering whether she should touch up the gray, as some of  her intimate friends advised, or let it alone as her brother Fred  insisted.    Miss Rose was too busy counting customers to notice who was in her  chair until she had come close.    \"Why, hello, Kate,\" she said then. \"I was just wondering what had  become of you.\"    \"Oh, I've been so busy, Marion. I just had to _steal_ the time today  to come. You weren't out to my reading last night, and I was afraid  you might not be well. Do you think that I ought to touch up my hair,  Marion? Of course, I don't mind it turning, so much--but you know  appearance counts _everything_ with an audience until one begins to  speak. Fred says to leave it alone--\"    \"Well, you do it.\" Miss Rose leaned over the chair with a handful of  hairpins to place in the little box on the dressing shelf, and spoke  confidentially in the ear of her patron. \"It's not my business to  knock the trade, Kate--but honestly, that sign up there, that says  'Hair Dyed at Your Own Risk' ought to say, 'to your own sorrow.' If  you start, you've got to keep it up or it looks simply frightful. And  if you keep it up it just ruins your hair. You have such _nice_ hair,  Kate!\" She picked up a sterilized brush and began stroking Kate's hair  soothingly. It was not such nice hair. It was very ordinary hair of a  somewhat nondescript color; but Kate was her dearest friend, and  praise is a part of the profession. \"What do you want?--a scalp,  shampoo, or just dressed, or a curl, or what?\"    \"What,\" Kate retorted pertly. \"Just fuss around while I talk to you,  Marion. I--\"    \"Rumley won't stand for fussing. I've got to do something she can  recognize across the room. How about a scalp? You can talk while I  massage, and then I'll show you a perfectly stunning way to do your  hair--it's new, and awfully good for your type of face. How do you  like mine today?\"    \"Why, I like it tremendously!\" Kate gave her an appraising glance in  the mirror. \"It's something new, isn't it? Use plenty of tonic, won't  you, Marion? They charge awful prices here--but their tonic has done  my hair so much good! Listen, could you get off early today? I simply  must talk to you. A perfectly tremendous opportunity has literally  fallen our way, and I want you to benefit by it also. A friend of  Douglas'--of Professor Harrison's, I should say--called our attention  to it. This friend wants to go in on it, but he can't leave his  "]]]
