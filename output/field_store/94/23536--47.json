Thy senses, friend, in this one hour  Shall grasp the world with clearer power  Than in a year's monotony.  The songs the tender spirits sing thee,  The lovely images they bring thee  Are not an idle magic play.  Thou shalt enjoy the daintiest savor,  Then feast thy taste on richest flavor,  Then thy charmed heart shall melt away.  Come, all are here, and all have been  Well trained and practised, now begin!    _Spirits_. Vanish, ye gloomy      Vaulted abysses!      Tenderer, clearer,      Friendlier, nearer,      Ether, look through!      O that the darkling      Cloud-piles were riven!      Starlight is sparkling,      Purer is heaven,      Holier sunshine      Softens the blue.      Graces, adorning      Sons of the morning--      Shadowy wavings--      Float along over;      Yearnings and cravings      After them hover.      Garments ethereal,      Tresses aerial,      Float o'er the flowers,      Float o'er the bowers,      Where, with deep feeling,      Thoughtful and tender,      Lovers, embracing,      Life-vows are sealing.      Bowers on bowers!      Graceful and slender      Vines interlacing!      Purple and blushing,      Under the crushing      Wine-presses gushing,      Grape-blood, o'erflowing,      Down over gleaming      Precious stones streaming,      Leaves the bright glowing      Tops of the mountains,      Leaves the red fountains,      Widening and rushing,      Till it encloses      Green hills all flushing,      Laden with roses.      Happy ones, swarming,      Ply their swift pinions,      Glide through the charming      Airy dominions,      Sunward still fleering,      Onward, where peering      Far o'er the ocean,      Islets are dancing      With an entrancing,      Magical motion;      Hear them, in chorus,      Singing high o'er us;      Over the meadows      Flit the bright shadows;      Glad eyes are glancing,      Tiny feet dancing.      Up the high ridges      Some of them clamber,      Others are skimming      Sky-lakes of amber,      Others are swimming      Over the ocean;--      All are in motion,      Life-ward all yearning,      Longingly turning      To the far-burning      Star-light of bliss.    _Mephistopheles_. He sleeps! Ye airy, tender youths, your numbers  Have sung him into sweetest slumbers!  You put me greatly in your debt by this.  Thou art not yet the man that shall hold fast the devil!  Still cheat his senses with your magic revel,  Drown him in dreams of endless youth;  But this charm-mountain on the sill to level,  I need, O rat, thy pointed tooth!  Nor need I conjure long, they're near me,  E'en now comes scampering one, who presently will hear me.    The sovereign lord of rats and mice,  Of flies and frogs and bugs and lice,  Commands thee to come forth this hour,  And gnaw this threshold with great power,  As he with oil the same shall smear--  Ha! with a skip e'en now thou'rt here!  But brisk to work! The point by which I'm cowered,  Is on the ledge, the farthest forward.  Yet one more bite, the deed is done.--  Now, Faust, until we meet again, dream on!    _Faust_. [_Waking_.] Again has witchcraft triumphed o'er me?  Was it a ghostly show, so soon withdrawn?  I dream, the devil stands himself before me--wake, to find a poodle gone!              STUDY-CHAMBER.        FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES.      _Faust_. A knock? Walk in! Who comes again to tease me?    _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis I.    _Faust_. Come in!    _Mephistopheles_. Must say it thrice, to please me.    _Faust_. Come in then!    _Mephistopheles_. That I like to hear.  We shall, I hope, bear with each other;  For to dispel thy crotchets, brother,  As a young lord, I now appear,  In scarlet dress, trimmed with gold lacing,  A stiff silk cloak with stylish facing,  A tall cock's feather in my hat,  A long, sharp rapier to defend me,  And I advise thee, short and flat,  In the same costume to attend me;  If thou wouldst, unembarrassed, see  What sort of thing this life may be.    _Faust_. In every dress I well may feel the sore  Of this low earth-life's melancholy.  I am too old to live for folly,  Too young, to wish for nothing more.  Am I content with all creation?  Renounce! renounce! Renunciation--  Such is the everlasting song  That in the ears of all men rings,  Which every hour, our whole life long,  With brazen accents hoarsely sings.  With terror I behold each morning's light,  With bitter tears my eyes are filling,  To see the day that shall not in its flight  Fulfil for me one wish, not one, but killing  Every presentiment of zest  With wayward skepticism, chases  The fair creations from my breast  With all life's thousand cold grimaces.  And when at night I stretch me on my bed  And darkness spreads its shadow o'er me;  No rest comes then anigh my weary head,  Wild dreams and spectres dance before me.  The God who dwells within my soul  Can heave its depths at any hour;  Who holds o'er all my faculties control  Has o'er the outer world no power;  Existence lies a load upon my breast,  Life is a curse and death a long'd-for rest.    _Mephistopheles_. And yet death never proves a wholly welcome guest.    _Faust_. O blest! for whom, when victory's joy fire blazes,  Death round his brow the bloody laurel windeth,  Whom, weary with the dance's mazes,  He on a maiden's bosom findeth.  O that, beneath the exalted spirit's power,  I had expired, in rapture sinking!    _Mephistopheles_. And yet I knew one, in a midnight hour,  Who a brown liquid shrank from drinking.    _Faust_. Eaves-dropping seems a favorite game with thee.    _Mephistopheles_. Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me.    _Faust_. Since that sweet tone, with fond appealing,  Drew me from witchcraft's horrid maze,  And woke the lingering childlike feeling  With harmonies of happier days;  My curse on all the mock-creations  That weave their spell around the soul,  And bind it with their incantations  And orgies to this wretched hole!  Accursed be the high opinion  Hugged by the self-exalting mind!  Accursed all the dream-dominion  That makes the dazzled senses blind!  Curs'd be each vision that befools us,  Of fame, outlasting earthly life!  Curs'd all that, as possession, rules us,  As house and barn, as child and wife!  Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure  He fires our hearts for deeds of might,  When, for a dream of idle pleasure,  He makes our pillow smooth and light!  Curs'd be the grape-vine's balsam-juices!  On love's high grace my curses fall!  On faith! On hope that man seduces,  On patience last, not least, of all!    _Choir of spirits_. [_Invisible_.] Woe! Woe!      Thou hast ground it to dust,      The beautiful world,      With mighty fist;      To ruins 'tis hurled;      A demi-god's blow hath done it!      A moment we look upon it,      Then carry (sad duty!)      The fragments over into nothingness,      With tears unavailing      Bewailing      All the departed beauty.      Lordlier      Than all sons of men,      Proudlier      Build it again,      Build it up in thy breast anew!      A fresh career pursue,      Before thee      A clearer view,      And, from the Empyrean,      A new-born Paean      Shall greet thee, too!    _Mephistopheles_. Be pleased to admire      My juvenile choir!      Hear how they counsel in manly measure      Action and pleasure!      Out into life,      Its joy and strife,      Away from this lonely hole,      Where senses and soul      Rot in stagnation,      Calls thee their high invitation.    Give over toying with thy sorrow  Which like a vulture feeds upon thy heart;  Thou shalt, in the worst company, to-morrow  Feel that with men a man thou art.  Yet I do not exactly intend  Among the canaille to plant thee.  I'm none of your magnates, I grant thee;  Yet if thou art willing, my friend,  Through life to jog on beside me,  Thy pleasure in all things shall guide me,  To thee will I bind me,  A friend thou shalt find me,  And, e'en to the grave,  Shalt make me thy servant, make me thy slave!    _Faust_. And in return what service shall I render?    _Mephistopheles_. There's ample grace--no hurry, not the least.    _Faust_. No, no, the devil is an egotist,  And does not easily \"for God's sake\" tender  That which a neighbor may assist.  Speak plainly the conditions, come!  'Tis dangerous taking such a servant home.    _Mephistopheles_. I to thy service _here_ agree to bind me,  To run and never rest at call of thee;  When _over yonder_ thou shalt find me,  Then thou shalt do as much for me.    _Faust_. I care not much what's over yonder:  When thou hast knocked this world asunder,  Come if it will the other may!  Up from this earth my pleasures all are streaming,  Down on my woes this earthly sun is beaming;  Let me but end this fit of dreaming,  Then come what will, I've nought to say.  I'll hear no more of barren wonder  If in that world they hate and love,  And whether in that future yonder  There's a Below and an Above.    _Mephistopheles._ In such a mood thou well mayst venture.  Bind thyself to me, and by this indenture  Thou shalt enjoy with relish keen  Fruits of my arts that man had never seen.    _Faust_. And what hast thou to give, poor devil?  Was e'er a human mind, upon its lofty level,  Conceived of by the like of thee?  Yet hast thou food that brings satiety,  Not satisfaction; gold that reftlessly,  Like quicksilver, melts down within  The hands; a game in which men never win;  A maid that, hanging on my breast,  Ogles a neighbor with her wanton glances;  Of fame the glorious godlike zest,  That like a short-lived meteor dances--  Show me the fruit that, ere it's plucked, will rot,  And trees from which new green is daily peeping!    _Mephistopheles_. Such a requirement scares me not;  Such treasures have I in my keeping.  Yet shall there also come a time, good friend,  When we may feast on good things at our leisure.    _Faust_. If e'er I lie content upon a lounge of pleasure--  Then let there be of me an end!

Sensible, however, of the delusion,  he felt no sentiment save that of wonder at the extraordinary accuracy  of the resemblance, and stepped onwards towards the figure, which  resolved itself, as he approached, into the various materials of which  it was composed. These were merely a screen, occupied by great-coats,  shawls, plaids, and such other articles as usually are found in a  country entrance-hall. The spectator returned to the spot from which he  had seen the illusion, and endeavoured, with all his power, to recall  the image which had been so singularly vivid. But this was beyond his  capacity; and the person who had witnessed the apparition, or, more  properly, whose excited state had been the means of raising it, had only  to return into the apartment, and tell his young friend under what a  striking hallucination he had for a moment laboured.    There is every reason to believe that instances of this kind are  frequent among persons of a certain temperament, and when such occur in  an early period of society, they are almost certain to be considered as  real supernatural appearances. They differ from those of Nicolai, and  others formerly noticed, as being of short duration, and constituting no  habitual or constitutional derangement of the system. The apparition of  Maupertuis to Monsieur Gleditsch, that of the Catholic clergyman to  Captain C----, that of a late poet to his friend, are of the latter  character. They bear to the former the analogy, as we may say, which a  sudden and temporary fever-fit has to a serious feverish illness. But,  even for this very reason, it is more difficult to bring such momentary  impressions back to their real sphere of optical illusions, since they  accord much better with our idea of glimpses of the future world than  those in which the vision is continued or repeated for hours, days, and  months, affording opportunities of discovering, from other  circumstances, that the symptom originates in deranged health.    Before concluding these observations upon the deceptions of the senses,  we must remark that the eye is the organ most essential to the purpose  of realizing to our mind the appearance of external objects, and that  when the visual organ becomes depraved for a greater or less time, and  to a farther or more limited extent, its misrepresentation of the  objects of sight is peculiarly apt to terminate in such hallucinations  as those we have been detailing. Yet the other senses or organs, in  their turn, and to the extent of their power, are as ready, in their  various departments, as the sight itself, to retain false or doubtful  impressions, which mislead, instead of informing, the party to whom they  are addressed.    Thus, in regard to the ear, the next organ in importance to the eye, we  are repeatedly deceived by such sounds as are imperfectly gathered up  and erroneously apprehended. From the false impressions received from  this organ also arise consequences similar to those derived from  erroneous reports made by the organs of sight. A whole class of  superstitious observances arise, and are grounded upon inaccurate and  imperfect hearing. To the excited and imperfect state of the ear we owe  the existence of what Milton sublimely calls--    The airy tongues that syllable men's names,  On shores, in desert sands, and wildernesses.    These also appear such natural causes of alarm, that we do not  sympathize more readily with Robinson Crusoe's apprehensions when he  witnesses the print of the savage's foot in the sand, than in those  which arise from his being waked from sleep by some one calling his name  in the solitary island, where there existed no man but the shipwrecked  mariner himself. Amidst the train of superstitions deduced from the  imperfections of the ear, we may quote that visionary summons which the  natives of the Hebrides acknowledged as one sure sign of approaching  fate. The voice of some absent, or probably some deceased, relative was,  in such cases, heard as repeating the party's name. Sometimes the aerial  summoner intimated his own death, and at others it was no uncommon  circumstance that the person who fancied himself so called, died in  consequence;--for the same reason that the negro pines to death who is  laid under the ban of an Obi woman, or the Cambro-Briton, whose name is  put into the famous cursing well, with the usual ceremonies, devoting  him to the infernal gods, wastes away and dies, as one doomed to do so.  It may be remarked also, that Dr. Johnson retained a deep impression  that, while he was opening the door of his college chambers, he heard  the voice of his mother, then at many miles' distance, call him by his  name; and it appears he was rather disappointed that no event of  consequence followed a summons sounding so decidedly supernatural. It is  unnecessary to dwell on this sort of auricular deception, of which most  men's recollection will supply instances. The following may he stated as  one serving to show by what slender accidents the human ear may be  imposed upon. The author was walking, about two years since, in a wild  and solitary scene with a young friend, who laboured under the infirmity  of a severe deafness, when he heard what he conceived to be the cry of a  distant pack of hounds, sounding intermittedly. As the season was  summer, this, on a moment's reflection, satisfied the hearer that it  could not be the clamour of an actual chase, and yet his ears repeatedly  brought back the supposed cry. He called upon his own dogs, of which two  or three were with the walking party. They came in quietly, and  obviously had no accession to the sounds which had caught the author's  attention, so that he could not help saying to his companion, \"I am  doubly sorry for your infirmity at this moment, for I could otherwise  have let you hear the cry of the Wild Huntsman.\" As the young gentleman  used a hearing tube, he turned when spoken to, and, in doing so, the  cause of the phenomenon became apparent. The supposed distant sound was  in fact a nigh one, being the singing of the wind in the instrument  which the young gentleman was obliged to use, but which, from various  circumstances, had never occurred to his elder friend as likely to  produce the sounds he had heard.    It is scarce necessary to add, that the highly imaginative superstition  of the Wild Huntsman in Germany seems to have had its origin in strong  fancy, operating upon the auricular deceptions, respecting the numerous  sounds likely to occur in the dark recesses of pathless forests. The  same clew may be found to the kindred Scottish belief, so finely  embodied by the nameless author of \"Albania:\"--    \"There, since of old the haughty Thanes of Ross  Were wont, with clans and ready vassals thronged,  To wake the bounding stag, or guilty wolf;  There oft is heard at midnight or at noon,  Beginning faint, but rising still more loud,  And louder, voice of hunters, and of hounds,  And horns hoarse-winded, blowing far and keen.  Forthwith the hubbub multiplies, the air  Labours with louder shouts and rifer din  Of close pursuit, the broken cry of deer  Mangled by throttling dogs, the shouts of men,  And hoofs, thick-beating on the hollow hill:  Sudden the grazing heifer in the vale  Starts at the tumult, and the herdsman's ears  Tingle with inward dread. Aghast he eyes  The upland ridge, and every mountain round,  But not one trace of living wight discerns,  Nor knows, o'erawed and trembling as he stands,  To what or whom he owes his idle fear--  To ghost, to witch, to fairy, or to fiend,  But wonders, and no end of wondering finds.\"[3]    It must also be remembered, that to the auricular deceptions practised  by the means of ventriloquism or otherwise, may be traced many of the  most successful impostures which credulity has received as supernatural  communications.    [Footnote 3: The poem of \"Albania\" is, in its original folio edition, so  extremely scarce that I have only seen a copy belonging to the amiable  and ingenious Dr. Beattie, besides the one which I myself possess,  printed in the earlier part of last century. It was reprinted by my late  friend Dr. Leyden in a small volume entitled \"Scottish Descriptive  Poems.\" \"Albania\" contains the above, and many other poetical passages  of the highest merit.]    The sense of touch seems less liable to perversion than either that of  sight or smell, nor are there many cases in which it can become  accessary to such false intelligence as the eye and ear, collecting  their objects from a greater distance and by less accurate enquiry, are  but too ready to convey. Yet there is one circumstance in which the  sense of touch as well as others is very apt to betray its possessor  into inaccuracy, in respect to the circumstances which it impresses on  its owner. The case occurs during sleep, when the dreamer touches with  his hand some other part of his own person. He is clearly, in this case,  both the actor and patient, both the proprietor of the member touching,  and of that which is touched; while, to increase the complication, the  hand is both toucher of the limb on which it rests, and receives an  impression of touch from it; and the same is the case with the limb,  which at one and the same time receives an impression from the hand, and  conveys to the mind a report respecting the size, substance, and the  like, of the member touching. Now, as during sleep the patient is  unconscious that both limbs are his own identical property, his mind is  apt to be much disturbed by the complication of sensations arising from  two parts of his person being at once acted upon, and from their  reciprocal action; and false impressions are thus received, which,  accurately enquired into, would afford a clew to many puzzling phenomena  in the theory of dreams.
