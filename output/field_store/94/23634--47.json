It became really necessary to  communicate with the beings, whatever they were, shut up inside the  machine.  I searched all over the outside for an aperture, a panel, or  a manhole, to use a technical expression; but the lines of the iron  rivets, solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates, were clear  and uniform.  Besides, the moon disappeared then, and left us in total  darkness.    At last this long night passed.  My indistinct remembrance prevents my  describing all the impressions it made.  I can only recall one  circumstance.  During some lulls of the wind and sea, I fancied I heard  several times vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced by  words of command.  What was, then, the mystery of this submarine craft,  of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation?  What kind of  beings existed in this strange boat?  What mechanical agent caused its  prodigious speed?    Daybreak appeared.  The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon  cleared off.  I was about to examine the hull, which formed on deck a  kind of horizontal platform, when I felt it gradually sinking.    \"Oh! confound it!\" cried Ned Land, kicking the resounding plate.  \"Open, you inhospitable rascals!\"    Happily the sinking movement ceased.  Suddenly a noise, like iron works  violently pushed aside, came from the interior of the boat.  One iron  plate was moved, a man appeared, uttered an odd cry, and disappeared  immediately.    Some moments after, eight strong men, with masked faces, appeared  noiselessly, and drew us down into their formidable machine.        CHAPTER VIII    MOBILIS IN MOBILI    This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with  the rapidity of lightning.  I shivered all over.  Whom had we to deal  with?  No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their  own way.  Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was  enveloped in darkness.  My eyes, dazzled with the outer light, could  distinguish nothing.  I felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an  iron ladder.  Ned Land and Conseil, firmly seized, followed me.  At the  bottom of the ladder, a door opened, and shut after us immediately with  a bang.    We were alone.  Where, I could not say, hardly imagine.  All was black,  and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been  able to discern even the faintest glimmer.    Meanwhile, Ned Land, furious at these proceedings, gave free vent to  his indignation.    \"Confound it!\" cried he, \"here are people who come up to the Scotch for  hospitality.  They only just miss being cannibals.  I should not be  surprised at it, but I declare that they shall not eat me without my  protesting.\"    \"Calm yourself, friend Ned, calm yourself,\" replied Conseil, quietly.  \"Do not cry out before you are hurt.  We are not quite done for yet.\"    \"Not quite,\" sharply replied the Canadian, \"but pretty near, at all  events.  Things look black.  Happily, my bowie knife I have still, and  I can always see well enough to use it.  The first of these pirates who  lays a hand on me----\"    \"Do not excite yourself, Ned,\" I said to the harpooner, \"and do not  compromise us by useless violence.  Who knows that they will not listen  to us?  Let us rather try to find out where we are.\"    I groped about.  In five steps I came to an iron wall, made of plates  bolted together.  Then turning back I struck against a wooden table,  near which were ranged several stools.  The boards of this prison were  concealed under a thick mat, which deadened the noise of the feet.  The  bare walls revealed no trace of window or door.  Conseil, going round  the reverse way, met me, and we went back to the middle of the cabin,  which measured about twenty feet by ten.  As to its height, Ned Land,  in spite of his own great height, could not measure it.    Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered,  when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light.  Our prison  was suddenly lighted, that is to say, it became filled with a luminous  matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first.  In its whiteness  and intensity I recognised that electric light which played round the  submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence.  After  shutting my eyes involuntarily, I opened them, and saw that this  luminous agent came from a half globe, unpolished, placed in the roof  of the cabin.    \"At last one can see,\" cried Ned Land, who, knife in hand, stood on the  defensive.    \"Yes,\" said I; \"but we are still in the dark about ourselves.\"    \"Let master have patience,\" said the imperturbable Conseil.    The sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely.  It  only contained a table and five stools.  The invisible door might be  hermetically sealed.  No noise was heard.  All seemed dead in the  interior of this boat.  Did it move, did it float on the surface of the  ocean, or did it dive into its depths?  I could not guess.    A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared.    One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs,  strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick  penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population  of Southern France.    The second stranger merits a more detailed description.  I made out his  prevailing qualities directly:  self-confidence--because his head was  well set on his shoulders, and his black eyes looked around with cold  assurance; calmness--for his skin, rather pale, showed his coolness of  blood; energy--evinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows; and  courage--because his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs.    Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could not  say.  He was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut  mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly  nervous temperament.  This man was certainly the most admirable  specimen I had ever met.  One particular feature was his eyes, rather  far from each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the  horizon at once.    This faculty--(I verified it later)--gave him a range of vision far  superior to Ned Land's. When this stranger fixed upon an object, his  eyebrows met, his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the  range of his vision, and he looked as if he magnified the objects  lessened by distance, as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque  to our eyes, and as if he read the very depths of the seas.    The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and  shod with sea boots of seal's skin, were dressed in clothes of a  particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs.  The  taller of the two, evidently the chief on board, examined us with great  attention, without saying a word; then, turning to his companion,  talked with him in an unknown tongue.  It was a sonorous, harmonious,  and flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied  accentuation.    The other replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three  perfectly incomprehensible words.  Then he seemed to question me by a  look.    I replied in good French that I did not know his language; but he  seemed not to understand me, and my situation became more embarrassing.    \"If master were to tell our story,\" said Conseil, \"perhaps these  gentlemen may understand some words.\"    I began to tell our adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and  without omitting one single detail.  I announced our names and rank,  introducing in person Professor Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and  master Ned Land, the harpooner.    The man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly, even politely,  and with extreme attention; but nothing in his countenance indicated  that he had understood my story.  When I finished, he said not a word.    There remained one resource, to speak English.  Perhaps they would know  this almost universal language.  I knew it--as well as the German  language--well enough to read it fluently, but not to speak it  correctly.  But, anyhow, we must make ourselves understood.    \"Go on in your turn,\" I said to the harpooner; \"speak your best  Anglo-Saxon, and try to do better than I.\"    Ned did not beg off, and recommenced our story.    To his great disgust, the harpooner did not seem to have made himself  more intelligible than I had.  Our visitors did not stir.  They  evidently understood neither the language of England nor of France.    Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted our speaking  resources, I knew not what part to take, when Conseil said:    \"If master will permit me, I will relate it in German.\"    But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the  German language had no success.  At last, nonplussed, I tried to  remember my first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but  with no better success.  This last attempt being of no avail, the two  strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language, and retired.    The door shut.    \"It is an infamous shame,\" cried Ned Land, who broke out for the  twentieth time.  \"We speak to those rogues in French, English, German,  and Latin, and not one of them has the politeness to answer!\"    \"Calm yourself,\" I said to the impetuous Ned; \"anger will do no good.\"    \"But do you see, Professor,\" replied our irascible companion, \"that we  shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?\"    \"Bah!\" said Conseil, philosophically; \"we can hold out some time yet.\"    \"My friends,\" I said, \"we must not despair.  We have been worse off  than this.

Such larvae  as these latter are examples of the type called _eruciform_ by A.S.  Packard (1898) who as well as other writers has laid stress on the  series of transitional steps from the campodeiform to the eruciform type  afforded by the larvae of the Coleoptera.    A fact of much importance in the transformations of beetles as pointed  out by Brauer (1869) is that in a few families, the first larval instar  is campodeiform, while the subsequent instars are eruciform. We may take  as an example of such 'hypermetamorphosis' the life-story of the Oil or  Blister-beetles (Meloidae) as first described by J.H. Fabre (1857), and  later with more elaboration by H. Beauregard (1890). From the egg of one  of these beetles is hatched a minute armoured larva, with long feelers,  legs, and cerci, whose task is, for example, to seize hold of a bee in  order that the latter may carry it, an uninvited guest, to her nest.  Safely within the nest, the little 'triungulin' beetle-grub moults; the  second instar has a soft cuticle and relatively shorter legs, which, as  the larva, now living as a cuckoo-parasite, proceeds to gorge itself  with honey, soon appear still further abbreviated. Later comes a stage  during which legs are entirely wanting, the larva then resting and  taking no food. The last larval instar again has short legs like the  grub of the second period. In connection with this life-history we  notice that the newly-hatched larva is not in the neighbourhood of its  appropriate food. Hence the preliminary armoured and active instar is  necessary in order to reach the feeding place; this journey  accomplished, the eruciform condition is at once assumed.    In all cases indeed we may say that the particular larval form is  adapted to the special conditions of life. A few examples from other  orders of endopterygote insects will illustrate this point. The  campodeiform type is relatively unusual, but most of the Neuroptera have  larvae of this kind, active, armoured creatures with long legs, though  devoid of the tail-processes often associated with similar larvae among  the Coleoptera. Such are the 'Ant-lions,' larvae of the exotic lacewing  flies, which hunt small insects, digging a sandy pit for their unwary  steps in the case of the best-known members of the group, some of which  are found as far north as Paris. In our own islands the 'Aphis-lions,'  larvae of Hemerobius and Chrysopa, prowl on plants infested with  'green-fly' which they impale on their sharp grooved mandibles, sucking  out the victims' juices, and then, in some cases, using the dried  cuticle to furnish a clothing for their own bodies. Among these insects,  while the mouth of the imago is of the normal mandibulate type adapted  for eating solid food, the larval mouth is constricted and the slender  mandibles are grooved for the transmission of liquid food.    Turning to eruciform types of larva, we find the _caterpillar_ (fig. 1  _b_, _c_, _d_) distinguished by its elongate, usually cylindrical body  with feeble cuticle, short thoracic legs and a variable number of pairs  of abdominal pro-legs, universal among the moths and butterflies forming  the great order Lepidoptera, and usual among the saw-flies, which belong  to the Hymenoptera. The vast majority of caterpillars feed on the leaves  of plants and their long worm-like bodies with the series of paired  pro-legs, are excellently adapted for their habit of clinging to twigs,  and crawling along shoots or the edges of leaves as they go in search of  food. Of great importance to a caterpillar is its power of spinning  silk, consisting of fine threads solidified from the secretion of  specially modified salivary glands whose ducts open in the insect's  mouth at the tip of the tubular tongue which forms a spinneret.    On the same bush caterpillars of moths and of saw-flies may often be  seen feeding together. The lepidopterous caterpillar, in our countries  at least, has never more than five pairs of pro-legs, situated on the  third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and tenth abdominal segments; each of these  pro-legs bears a number of minute hooklets, arranged in a circular or  crescentic pattern, which assist the caterpillar in clinging to its  food-plant. The saw-fly caterpillar, on the other hand, may have as many  as eight pairs of pro-legs, the series beginning on the second abdominal  segment; here, however, the pro-legs have no hooklets. Among the  Lepidoptera, we notice a reduction in the number of pro-legs in the  'looper' caterpillars of Geometrid moths. Here only two pairs are  present, those on the sixth and tenth abdominal segments. Consequently,  as the caterpillar can cling only by the thorax and by the hinder region  of the abdomen, the middle region of the body is first straightened out  and then bent into an arch-like form, as the insect makes its progress  by alternate movements of stretching and 'looping.'    [Illustration: Fig. 17. _c_, Ruby Tiger Moth (_Phragmatobia  fuliginosa_); _a_, caterpillar; _b_, cocoon. After Lugger, _Insect  Life_, vol. II.]    Caterpillars, with their relatively soft bodies, feeding openly on the  leaves of plants, are exposed to the attacks of many enemies, and the  various ways in which they obtain protection are well worth studying. A  clothing of hairs[7] or spines is often present, and it is interesting  to find that many species of our native Tiger and Eggar Moths (Arctiadae  and Lasiocampidae) which pass the winter in the larval stage, have  caterpillars with an especially dense hairy covering (fig. 17).  Experiments have shown that hairy and spiny insects are distasteful to  birds and other creatures that prey readily on smooth-skinned species, a  conclusion that might well have been expected. Certain smooth  caterpillars however appear to be protected by producing some nauseous  secretion, which renders them unpalatable. Many of these, as the  familiar cream yellow and black larva of the Magpie Moth (_Abraxas  grossulariata_), are very conspicuously adorned, and furnish examples of  what is known as 'warning coloration,' on the supposition that the gaudy  aspect of such insects serves as an advertisement that they are not fit  to eat, and that birds and other possible devourers thus learn to leave  them alone. On the other hand, smooth caterpillars which are readily  eaten by birds are usually 'protectively' coloured, so as to resemble  their surroundings and remain hidden except to careful seekers. Many  such caterpillars are green, the upper surface, which is naturally  exposed to the light, being darker than the lower which is in shadow.  When the caterpillar is large, the green area is often broken up by pale  lines, longitudinal as on the larvae of many Owl Moths (Noctuidae) or  oblique, as on the great caterpillars of most Hawk Moths (Sphingidae).  Such an arrangement tends to make the insect less easily seen than were  it to display a continuous area of the same colour. The 'looper'  caterpillars mentioned above afford remarkable examples of 'protective'  resemblance, for many of them show a marvellous likeness to the twigs of  their food-plant, tubercles on the insect's body resembling closely the  little outgrowths of the plant's cortex. It has been shown by E.B.  Poulton (1892) that many caterpillars are, in their early stages,  directly responsive to their surroundings as regards colour. Usually  green when hatched, they remain green if kept among leaves or young  shoots of plants, while they turn red, brown, or blackish if placed  among twigs of these respective hues. This effect appears to be due to a  direct response of the subcutaneous tissue to the rays of light  reflected from the surrounding objects. The sensitiveness dies away as  the caterpillar grows older, since little or no change of hue in  response to a change of environment could be induced after the  penultimate moult.    [7] The 'hairs' of an insect are not in the least comparable to the  hairs of mammals, being in truth, modified portions of the cuticle,  secreted by special cells.    Among those families of the Lepidoptera which are usually regarded as  low in the scale of organisation, caterpillars are very generally  protected by the habit of feeding in some concealed situation. For  example, the great larvae of the Goat Moth (Cossus) and the whitish  caterpillars of the Clearwing Moths (Sesiidae) burrow through the wood  of trees, eating the timber as they go. The little irritable  caterpillars of the Bell Moths (Tortricidae) roll leaves, fastening the  edges together with silk, and thus make for themselves a shelter; or  they bore their way into seeds or fruits, like the larva of the Codling  Moth that is the cause of 'worm-eaten' apples, too well-known to  orchard-keepers. Very many small caterpillars mine between the two skins  of a leaf, eating out the soft green tissue, and giving rise to a  characteristic blister in form of a spreading patch or a narrow sinuous  track through the leaf. The caterpillars of the Clothes-moths (Tineidae)  make for themselves garments out of their own excrement, the particles  fastened together by silk. In such curious cylindrical cases they wander  over the wool or fur, feeding and indirectly supplying themselves with  clothing at the same time.    The case-forming habit of the Clothes-moth caterpillars leads us  naturally to consider the similar habit adopted by their allies the  Caddis-larvae which live in the waters of ponds and streams, for the  Caddis-flies (Trichoptera) have much in common with the more primitive  Lepidoptera. The caddis-larva is as a rule of the eruciform type, but  with well-developed thoracic legs, and with hook-like tail-appendages;  by means of the latter it anchors itself to the extremity of its curious  'house.' It is of interest to note that in the earlier stages of some  caddises lately described and figured by A.J. Siltala (1907), the legs  are relatively very long, and the larva"]]]
