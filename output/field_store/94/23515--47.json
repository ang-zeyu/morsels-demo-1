She was manifestly a constitutionally  triumphant woman. A certain afternoon lassitude vanished in the swirl  of her arrival. Mr. Philbert removed wrappings and handed them to the  manservant.    \"I lunched with Sir Edward Carson to-day, my dear,\" she told Lady  Homartyn, and rolled a belligerent eye at Philbert.    \"And is he as obdurate as ever?\" asked Sir Thomas.    \"Obdurate! It's Redmond who's obdurate,\" cried Lady Frensham. \"What do  you say, Mr. Britling?\"    \"A plague on both your parties,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"You can't keep out of things like that,\" said Lady Frensham with the  utmost gusto, \"when the country's on the very verge of civil war.... You  people who try to pretend there isn't a grave crisis when there is one,  will be more accountable than any one--when the civil war does come. It  won't spare you. Mark my words!\"    The party became a circle.    Mr. Direck found himself the interested auditor of a real English  country-house week-end political conversation. This at any rate was like  the England of which Mrs. Humphry Ward's novels had informed him, but  yet not exactly like it. Perhaps that was due to the fact that for the  most part these novels dealt with the England of the 'nineties, and  things had lost a little in dignity since those days. But at any rate  here were political figures and titled people, and they were talking  about the \"country.\"...    Was it possible that people of this sort did \"run\" the country, after  all?... When he had read Mrs. Humphry Ward in America he had always  accepted this theory of the story quite easily, but now that he saw and  heard them--!    But all governments and rulers and ruling classes when you look at them  closely are incredible....    \"I don't believe the country is on the verge of civil war,\" said Mr.  Britling.    \"Facts!\" cried Lady Frensham, and seemed to wipe away delusions with a  rapid gesture of her hands.    \"You're interested in Ireland, Mr. Dirks?\" asked Lady Homartyn.    \"We see it first when we come over,\" said Mr. Direck rather neatly, and  after that he was free to attend to the general discussion.    Lady Frensham, it was manifest, was one of that energetic body of  aristocratic ladies who were taking up an irreconcilable attitude  against Home Rule \"in any shape or form\" at that time. They were rapidly  turning British politics into a system of bitter personal feuds in which  all sense of imperial welfare was lost. A wild ambition to emulate the  extremest suffragettes seems to have seized upon them. They insulted,  they denounced, they refused every invitation lest they should meet that  \"traitor\" the Prime Minister, they imitated the party hatreds of a  fiercer age, and even now the moderate and politic Philbert found  himself treated as an invisible object. They were supported by the  extremer section of the Tory press, and the most extraordinary writers  were set up to froth like lunatics against the government as \"traitors,\"  as men who \"insulted the King\"; the _Morning Post_ and the  lighter-witted side of the Unionist press generally poured out a torrent  of partisan nonsense it is now almost incredible to recall. Lady  Frensham, bridling over Lady Homartyn's party, and for a time leaving  Mr. Britling, hurried on to tell of the newest developments of the great  feud. She had a wonderful description of Lady Londonderry sitting  opposite \"that old rascal, the Prime Minister,\" at a performance of  Mozart's _Zauberfloete_.    \"If looks could kill!\" cried Lady Frensham with tremendous gusto.    \"Sir Edward is quite firm that Ulster means to fight. They have  machine-guns--ammunition. And I am sure the army is with us....\"    \"Where did they get those machine-guns and ammunition?\" asked Mr.  Britling suddenly.    \"Ah! that's a secret,\" cried Lady Frensham.    \"Um,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"You see,\" said Lady Frensham; \"it _will_ be civil war! And yet you  writing people who have influence do nothing to prevent it!\"    \"What are we to do, Lady Frensham?\"    \"Tell people how serious it is.\"    \"You mean, tell the Irish Nationalists to lie down and be walked over.  They won't be....\"    \"We'll see about that,\" cried Lady Frensham, \"we'll see about that!\"    She was a large and dignified person with a kind of figure-head nobility  of carriage, but Mr. Direck was suddenly reminded of a girl cousin of  his who had been expelled from college for some particularly elaborate  and aimless rioting....    \"May I say something to you, Lady Frensham,\" said Mr. Britling, \"that  you have just said to me? Do you realise that this Carsonite campaign is  dragging these islands within a measurable distance of civil war?\"    \"It's the fault of your Lloyd George and his government. It's the fault  of your Socialists and sentimentalists. You've made the mischief and you  have to deal with it.\"    \"Yes. But do you really figure to yourself what a civil war may mean for  the empire? Surely there are other things in the world besides this  quarrel between the 'loyalists' of Ulster and the Liberal government;  there are other interests in this big empire than party advantages? Yon  think you are going to frighten this Home Rule government into some  ridiculous sort of collapse that will bring in the Tories at the next  election. Well, suppose you don't manage that. Suppose instead that you  really do contrive to bring about a civil war. Very few people here or  in Ireland want it--I was over there not a month ago--but when men have  loaded guns in their hands they sometimes go off. And then people see  red. Few people realise what an incurable sore opens when fighting  begins. Suppose part of the army revolts and we get some extraordinary  and demoralising fighting over there. India watches these things. Bengal  may imitate Ireland. At that distance rebellion and treason are  rebellion and treason whether they are coloured orange or green. And  then suppose the Germans see fit to attack us!\"    Lady Frensham had a woman's elusiveness. \"Your Redmondites would welcome  them with open arms.\"    \"It isn't the Redmondites who invite them now, anyhow,\" said Mr.  Britling, springing his mine. \"The other day one of your 'loyalists,'  Andrews, was talking in the _Morning Post_ of preferring conquest by  Germany to Home Rule; Craig has been at the same game; Major Crawford,  the man who ran the German Mausers last April, boasted that he would  transfer his allegiance to the German Emperor rather than see Redmond in  power.\"    \"Rhetoric!\" said Lady Frensham. \"Rhetoric!\"    \"But one of your Ulster papers has openly boasted that arrangements have  been made for a 'powerful Continental monarch' to help an Ulster  rebellion.\"    \"Which paper?\" snatched Lady Frensham.    Mr. Britling hesitated.    Mr. Philbert supplied the name. \"I saw it. It was the _Irish  Churchman_.\"    \"You two have got your case up very well,\" said Lady Frensham. \"I didn't  know Mr. Britling was a party man.\"    \"The Nationalists have been circulating copies,\" said Philbert.  \"Naturally.\"    \"They make it look worse than mere newspaper talk and speeches,\" Mr.  Britling pressed. \"Carson, it seems, was lunching with the German  Emperor last autumn. A fine fuss you'd make if Redmond did that. All  this gun-running, too, is German gun-running.\"    \"What does it matter if it is?\" said Lady Frensham, allowing a  belligerent eye to rest for the first time on Philbert. \"You drove us to  it. One thing we are resolved upon at any cost. Johnny Redmond may rule  England if he likes; he shan't rule Ireland....\"    Mr. Britling shrugged his shoulders, and his face betrayed despair.    \"My one consolation,\" he said, \"in this storm is a talk I had last month  with a young Irishwoman in Meath. She was a young person of twelve, and  she took a fancy to me--I think because I went with her in an alleged  dangerous canoe she was forbidden to navigate alone. All day the eternal  Irish Question had banged about over her observant head. When we were  out on the water she suddenly decided to set me right upon a disregarded  essential. 'You English,' she said, 'are just a bit disposed to take all  this trouble seriously. Don't you fret yourself about it... Half the  time we're just laffing at you. You'd best leave us all alone....'\"    And then he went off at a tangent from his own anecdote.    \"But look at this miserable spectacle!\" he cried. \"Here is a chance of  getting something like a reconciliation of the old feud of English and  Irish, and something like a settlement of these ancient distresses, and  there seems no power, no conscience, no sanity in any of us, sufficient  to save it from this cantankerous bitterness, this sheer wicked mischief  of mutual exasperation.... Just when Ireland is getting a gleam of  prosperity.... A murrain on both your parties!\"    \"I see, Mr. Britling, you'd hand us all over to Jim Larkin!\"    \"I'd hand you all over to Sir Horace Plunkett--\"    \"That doctrinaire dairyman!\" cried Lady Frensham, with an air of quite  conclusive repartee. \"You're hopeless, Mr. Britling. You're hopeless.\"    And Lady Homartyn, seeing that the phase of mere personal verdicts drew  near, created a diversion by giving Lady Frensham a second cup of tea,  and fluttering like a cooling fan about the heated brows of the  disputants. She suggested tennis....      Section 5    Mr. Britling was still flushed and ruffled as he and his guest returned  towards the Dower House. He criticised England himself unmercifully, but  he hated to think that in any respect she fell short of perfection; even  her defects he liked to imagine were just a subtler kind of power and  wisdom. And Lady Frensham had stuck her voice and her gestures through  all these amiable illusions. He was like a lover who calls his lady a  foolish rogue, and is startled to find that facts and strangers do  literally agree with him.
