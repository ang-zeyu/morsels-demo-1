But the King of Israel was afraid, and  thought the King of Syria sought this way to quarrel with him. When  Elisha heard of the King's fear, he sent and desired that Naaman  should be brought to him. So Naaman came in his chariot, and stood at  Elisha's door. But the prophet instead of coming to him, sent a  message directing Naaman to wash in Jordan seven times, when his  leprous flesh would be restored to health. Naaman had thought that  Elisha would have received him with much ceremony and touched him,  bidding the leprosy to depart; so he was angry and said, \"Are not the  rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? May I not  wash in them and be clean?\" Therefore he went away in a rage. But his  servants persuaded him to carry out the prophet's injunction, and he  went and dipped seven times in Jordan, and was made whole.    [Illustration: THE LITTLE CAPTIVE MAID.]          JONAH AT NINEVEH.      Jonah was commanded to go to Nineveh, and cry out that the city should  be destroyed on account of the wickedness of its inhabitants. But  instead of obeying God's command he fled in a ship that was bound for  Tarshish. Then a great storm arose, and the shipmen cast Jonah into  the sea, believing that the storm had been sent through his  disobedience. God saved Jonah by means of a large fish, and brought  him safely to land again.    A second time God said to Jonah, \"Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great  city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.\" So Jonah  arose and went as God had directed him. Now Nineveh was a very large  city, about sixty miles in circumference, and Jonah went some distance  inside and then cried out, \"Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be  overthrown!\" It was a strange and terrible cry which sounded  throughout the city, and as the Ninevites heard it they feared God,  proclaimed a fast, covered themselves with sackcloth, and every man  was commanded to forsake evil. So they hoped God would forgive them  and spare their city.    God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways,  therefore He spared their city. When Jonah saw that Nineveh was spared  he was very angry, and prayed God to take away his life. He made a  booth and sat under it to see what would become of the city. Then God  sheltered him from the sun by a gourd, and afterwards taught him by it  how wrong he was in being displeased because Nineveh had been spared.  Nineveh was afterwards overthrown, and has remained since then but a  heap of ruins.    [Illustration: JONAH AT NINEVEH.]          HEZEKIAH AND SENNACHERIB.      Sennacherib, the King of Assyria, invaded the land of Judah, and  threatened to lay siege to Jerusalem. Then Hezekiah took counsel with  his princes and mighty men, and repaired the broken walls, and made  them higher. He made many other preparations for the defence of the  city, and went among his people, exhorting them to trust in God, and  be of good courage. But Sennacherib sent messengers to induce those  that guarded the walls of the city to revolt against Hezekiah, saying,  \"Do not believe this Hezekiah when he tells you that your God will  deliver you; hath any of the nations against which I have made war  been delivered by their gods?\"    When Hezekiah heard these words he went into the house of the Lord,  and sent messengers to Isaiah, asking for his prayers. Isaiah said to  them, \"Thus saith the Lord, 'Be not afraid of the words with which the  King of Assyria hath blasphemed Me. I will send a blast upon him, and  he shall return and shall fall by the sword in his own land.'\"  Afterwards the King of Assyria sent a letter to Hezekiah, in which he  repeated his sneers at the power of God. When Hezekiah read it, he  went into the house of the Lord, and spreading the letter before the  Lord, prayed for His help. God answered, by the mouth of Isaiah, that  the King of Assyria should not enter Jerusalem, nor shoot over it, but  be turned back the way he came. And the same night the angel of the  Lord went into the camp of the Assyrians, and smote one hundred and  eighty-five thousand. Then Sennacherib returned to Nineveh, and as he  was worshipping in the house of his god, there came to him two of his  sons, who killed him.    [Illustration: HEZEKIAH LAYING THE LETTER BEFORE GOD.]          THE BRAVE HEBREW BOYS.      Brave boys and girls! We all wish to be brave, do we not? Then we must  learn to say \"No,\" when tempted to do wrong.    These Hebrew boys were young nobles who had been carried captive from  Jerusalem to Babylon; but though in a strange land, subject to the  mighty king Nebuchadnezzar, they feared not to refuse his food and  wine when they knew that the taking of it would cause them to sin  against God. They were well educated Hebrew youths, and the Babylonish  king had commanded that they should be taught the learning of the  Chaldeans; also, to keep them in health and with beautiful  countenances, he had ordered that the meat and wine from his table  should be given them. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and  Azariah. Daniel seems to have been their leader. We find \"he purposed  in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the  king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.\" So he begged the  king's servant the feed him and his three companions on plain food and  pure water; but the servant feared to do so, lest the king should find  them worse looking than those who ate his meat and drank his wine, and  the servant should lose his head in consequence. A trial was made,  however, for ten days, at the end of which time they were found to be  better looking than the boys fed on rich food and wine. Therefore, the  servant let them live plainly according to their request; and at the  end of three years, when they stood before the king, we are told that  for wisdom and understanding none were found like Daniel, Hananiah,  Mishael, and Azariah.    [Illustration: THE BRAVE HEBREW BOYS.]          DANIEL AND THE LIONS.      When Darius came to the throne, upon the death of Belshazzar, he set  over the kingdom a hundred and twenty princes. Over these he appointed  three presidents, of whom Daniel was first. Now the princes and other  presidents were jealous of Daniel, and sought to find some fault  against him; but could not, as he was a faithful servant of the King.  Then they tried to injure him because of his praying to God. So they  came to the King, and said, \"King Darius live for ever: all the great  officers of thy kingdom have consulted together to establish a royal  law, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty  days, save of thee, O King, he shall be cast into a den of lions.\" The  King signed the writing and established the law. But Daniel still  knelt and prayed three times a day as before.    His enemies saw him praying, and told the King, urging him to carry  out the law. But the King was angry with himself that he had agreed to  such a law, and tried to think of some way to save Daniel. Then these  men urged that the law could not be altered. So Daniel was cast into  the den of lions, and a stone was put over the mouth of the den, which  was sealed by the King and the lords. But the King had said to Daniel,  \"Thy God whom thou servest will deliver thee.\"    The King passed the night fasting, and could not sleep. In the  morning, very early, he arose and went to the den of lions, and cried  with a lamentable voice, \"O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy  God able to deliver thee from the lions?\" Then Daniel said, \"O King,  live for ever. My God hath sent His angel and shut the lions'  mouths.\"    [Illustration: DANIEL AND THE LIONS.]          ESTHER BEFORE THE KING.      Ahasuerus reigned over the vast empire of Persia, and Esther, the  adopted daughter of a Jew named Mordecai, was Queen. None in the  palace knew she was a Jewess, for Mordecai had charged her not to make  it known. He abode in the king's palace, and was one of the king's  servants.    Ahasuerus promoted Haman, one of his courtiers, a cruel and wicked  man, to be over all his princes and officers; and all bowed down to  Haman and did him reverence except Mordecai, the Jew. Then was Haman  filled with wrath against Mordecai and his people, and obtained from  the king a decree ordering that all the Jews throughout his dominions  should be slain. Mordecai informed Queen Esther of this decree, and  bade her go to the king and plead for her people. Now it was one of  the laws of the palace that no one should approach the king in the  inner court unless he had been previously called; the penalty for not  obeying this law being death, unless the king should hold out the  golden sceptre to the offender so that he might live. Esther knew the  danger of approaching the king uncalled for, but she bade Mordecai to  gather the Jews so that they might spend three days in fasting and  prayer, while she and her maidens did the same, and, said she, \"So  will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law, and if  I perish, I perish.\"    Esther went in. The king graciously held out the golden sceptre to  her, accepted her invitation to a banquet, and finally ordered the  wicked Haman to be hanged, and measures to be taken to preserve the  lives of the Jews.    [Illustration: ESTHER BEFORE THE KING.]          DAVID AND JONATHAN.      Jonathan was the son of Saul, the king. He loved David greatly, and  regretted that his father, through jealousy, sought David's life.  David, after the last attempt of Saul to smite him to the wall by a  javelin, fled away, and meeting with Jonathan said: \"What have I done?  What is mine iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father that he  seeketh my life?\"    Jonathan sympathised deeply with his friend, and tried to save him. He  promised to ascertain whether Saul fully intended to kill David, and,  if so, to inform"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#8)"],[1,"any one that pretends to accept the  invitation to be one of God's people, but in his heart does not  believe in Christ.    [Illustration: WITHOUT THE WEDDING GARMENT.]          THE FOOLISH VIRGINS.      In certain parts of the East it is the custom for a man when he is  married to bring home his bride at night, and for his relatives and  friends to go out with lamps and torches and music to meet him.    Ten young women had been invited to meet the bridegroom with their  lamps burning and to sit down with him at the wedding-feast. Five of  them were wise and five were foolish. The wise ones took a supply of  oil in case their lamps should burn out before the bridegroom arrived;  the foolish five took no oil but what was in their lamps. But before  the bridegroom came they all fell asleep.    At midnight there was a cry, \"Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out  to meet him.\" But five lamps had almost burnt out, and the foolish  virgins said unto the wise, \"Give us of your oil, for our lamps are  gone out.\" But the wise ones answered, \"Not so; lest there be not  enough for us and for you. Go ye, rather, to them that sell, and buy  for yourselves.\" And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and  they that were ready went in with him to the marriage-feast, and the  door was shut.    Afterwards, came also the other virgins, saying, \"Lord, Lord, open the  door to us.\" But he answered and said, \"Verily I say unto you, I know  you not,\" and would not open the door to them.    In this parable the bridegroom means Jesus returning to earth, on the  Day of Judgment. The ten virgins are the people of this world, some of  whom have their hearts full of the love of God and keep their lamps  burning with a steady and bright light; that is, they fulfil God's  commandments and obey the teachings of Christ. The others have not  this love in their hearts, and are not prepared for Christ's coming.  Their lamps give out a feeble light and soon will go out.    [Illustration: THE FOOLISH VIRGINS.]          THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS      One day Jesus told His disciples this parable or story.    A certain nobleman was called away to a far country to be appointed  king of it, and to return after a time. And he called his servants  unto him, and charged them with the care of his goods and treasure,  giving to each man according to his ability to use the same. To one  servant he gave five talents, to another two, and to another only one.  And straightway he left them, and departed upon his journey. Then the  man that had five talents went and traded with them, and did so well  that in time the profits amounted to five talents more, making ten  altogether. And he that had received two talents, also traded with  his, and added two other talents to them by way of profit. But he that  had had but one talent went away and covered it up in a cloth and hid  it away.    After a long time the nobleman came back and called his servants to  him, and asked them for the treasure he had entrusted to their  keeping. And he that had received five talents, brought ten, and said,  \"Lord, behold, I have gained five other talents beside them.\" And his  lord said, \"Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been  faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.  Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\" And to him that had two talents,  and brought back four, the lord said the same words. Then came he that  had received but one talent and had hid it; and he said, \"Lord, I knew  thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and I  was afraid, and went and hid thy talent, and lo, here thou hast that  which is thine.\" His lord said unto him, \"Thou wicked and slothful  servant. Thou knewest that I reaped where I had not sown; thou  oughtest therefore to have put my money in the bank, that I might have  received mine own with interest for its use. Take therefore the  talent from him, and give it unto him that hath ten; and take the  unprofitable servant and cast him into the outer darkness.\"    Now the talent here mentioned was an eastern sum of money (nearly one  thousand dollars), but it really means the powers and opportunities  for doing good that God has given to all of us. One day we shall all  be called upon to give an account of the talents entrusted to our  keeping, and woe be to those who have abused their stewardship by  hiding their talent away. But those who have done good, according to  the power and opportunity given to them, shall be received into  everlasting joy by Christ the Lord.    [Illustration: THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS.]           *       *       *       *       *          MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND.      One Sabbath-day Jesus went into the synagogue, and there He saw a man  that had a withered hand. By some means the muscles had lost their  power, and he could neither use his hand nor stretch it out. And the  Pharisees watched Jesus, to see if He would heal this man on the  Sabbath, that they might bring a charge against Him of breaking the  law. They asked Him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day?\" and He  replied by asking who among them, if he had a sheep which had fallen  into a pit on the Sabbath-day, would not lay hold on it, and lift it  out. \"How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is  lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day.\"    Then said He to the man, \"Stretch forth thine hand.\" And he stretched  it forth, and it was made whole and healthy like the other.    Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against Him, to  consider how they might destroy Him; but when Jesus knew it, He  withdrew Himself from that part, and great multitudes followed Him,  and He healed them all.    [Illustration: THE WITHERED HAND.]          JESUS ASCENDS TO HEAVEN.      Jesus had been cruelly put to death. His hands, which had been placed  on the heads of little children when He blessed them, had been nailed  to a cross of wood; and cruel nails had been driven through his feet.  And hanging on the cross, Jesus had died. But on the third day He had  risen from the tomb, and for forty days He had remained upon the  earth, meeting frequently with His disciples. At the end of that time  Jesus led the eleven apostles from Jerusalem towards Bethany; and when  near that village, and away from the multitude, He spoke to them,  promising that they should be made bold by the Holy Spirit, and  receive power to witness for Him both to the Jews and Gentiles. Then,  the Bible tells us, \"He lifted up His hands and blessed them. And it  came to pass, while He blessed them, He was parted from them, and  carried up into heaven.\" And as He went up, a cloud received Him out  of their sight.    The apostles fell down and worshipped Jesus, looking steadfastly after  Him as He went up; and as they did so, two angels in white garments  stood by them, and said, \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up  into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,  shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" Then  the apostles returned to Jerusalem.    Yes, Jesus has ascended to heaven, and now He sits at the right hand  of God; but He tells us that He will come again, and take those that  love Him to dwell with Him in His glorious home for ever and ever. \"I  go to prepare a place for you,\" Jesus says.    [Illustration: JESUS ASCENDING TO HEAVEN.]          THE PHILIPPIAN JAILER.      Paul and Silas were in prison. They had done no wrong, but wicked men  had taken them before the magistrates; and the magistrates had caused  them to be severely beaten, and afterwards had sent them to prison,  where they were securely fastened in an inner dungeon, and their feet  made fast in the stocks. This was a most painful position for Paul and  Silas. But they were not unhappy. They prayed to God, and sang praises  to Him; and they sang so heartily that the other prisoners heard them.  It was midnight, and all was dark in the prison. But suddenly there  was an earthquake; so that the foundations of the prison were shaken,  all the doors were opened, and every one's bonds were loosed. All the  prisoners might have run away had they been minded to do so.    The keeper of the prison had been sleeping, but the earthquake awoke  him. When he saw the doors open, he supposed that all the prisoners  had fled; and knowing how severely he would be punished on that  account, he drew his sword to kill himself. Paul knew this, and called  out loudly, \"Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.\" Then the  keeper, who but a little while before had cruelly treated Paul and  Silas, came trembling, and fell down before them, and said, \"Sirs,  what must I do to be saved?\" He was afraid because of his sins; and  wanted to know how he might be saved from the fearful consequences of  sin. Paul's answer was, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou  shalt be saved.\" Then Paul and Silas spoke to him about Jesus. He  believed, and was baptized; and the next morning the two disciples  were set at liberty.    [Illustration: THE PHILIPPIAN JAILOR BEFORE PAUL AND SILAS.]          TIMOTHY AND HIS MOTHER EUNICE.      Timothy was a youthful and earnest disciple of Jesus Christ, whom Paul  loved dearly. Paul had found him during one of his missionary  journeys, and, discovering how highly he was esteemed as a Christian,  had selected him as his assistant. Afterward Timothy became Paul's  companion in travel, and the first bishop of Ephesus. While Timothy  was at Ephesus, Paul wrote two letters to him. They are contained in  the Bible, and are called the Epistles to Timothy. In them Paul says  many kind and wise things, giving Timothy directions how to act in his  high Christian office. But Paul also speaks of Timothy's early days,  and of his mother and grandmother. These were both good women, who  loved God, and diligently studied the Holy Scriptures. The mother's  name was Eunice. She was a Jewess. The"]]]
