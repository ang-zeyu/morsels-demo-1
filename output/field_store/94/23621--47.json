Form and size: The tree grows in an irregular form to large size, with      its branches rather slender as compared with the white oak and with      a more open and narrow crown.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: It will grow in poor soils but does best where the      soil is rich and well drained.    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: The black oak is the poorest of the oaks for      planting and is rarely offered by nurserymen.    Commercial value: The wood is heavy, hard and strong, but checks readily      and is coarse grained. It is of little value except for fuel. The      bark is used for tannin.    Other common names: _Yellow oak_.    Comparisons: The black oak might sometimes be confused with the _red_      and _scarlet oaks_. The yellow, bitter inner bark will distinguish      the black oak from the other two. The light-colored, smooth bark of      the red oak and the dark, ridged bark of the black oak will      distinguish the two, while the bark of the scarlet oak has an      appearance intermediate between the two. The buds of the three      species also show marked differences. The buds of the black oak are      covered with hairs, those of the scarlet oak have fewer hairs and      those of the red are practically free from hairs. The leaves of each      of the three species are distinct and the growth habits are      different.      RED OAK (_Quercus rubra_)    Distinguishing characters: The *bark* is perpendicularly fissured into      long, _smooth, light gray strips_ giving the trunk a characteristic      *pillar effect* as in Figs. 61 and 94. It has the straightest trunk      of all the oaks. The leaves possess _more lobes_ than the leaves of      any of the other species of the black oak group, see Fig. 62. The      acorns, the largest among the oaks, are semispherical with the cups      extremely shallow. The buds are large and sharp pointed, but not as      large as those of the black oak. They also have a few fine hairs on      their scales, but are not nearly as downy as those of the Black oak.    [Illustration: FIG. 61--Bark of Red Oak.]    Form and size: The red oak is the largest of the oaks and among the      largest of the trees in the northern forests. It has a straight      trunk, free from branches to a higher point than in the white oak,      see Fig. 94. The branches are less twisted and emerge at sharper      angles than do those of the white oak.    Range: It grows all over Eastern North America and reaches north farther      than any of the other oaks.    Soil and location: It is less fastidious in its soil and moisture      requirements than the other oaks and therefore grows in a great      variety of soils. It requires plenty of light.    [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Leaf and Fruit of Red Oak.]    Enemies: Like most of the other oaks, this species is comparatively free      from insects and disease.    Value for planting: The red oak grows faster and adapts itself better to      poor soil conditions than any of the other oaks and is therefore      easy to plant and easy to find in the nurseries. It makes an      excellent street tree, is equally desirable for the lawn and is      hardly surpassed for woodland planting.    Commercial value: The wood is hard and strong but coarse grained, and is      used for construction timber, interior finish and furniture. It is      inferior to white oak where strength and durability are required.      PIN OAK (_Quercus palustris_)    Distinguishing characters: Its method of *branching* will characterize      the tree at a glance. It develops a well-defined _main_ ascending      _stem_ with numerous _drooping_ side _branches_ as in Fig. 63. The      buds are very small and sharp pointed and the leaves are small as in      Fig. 64. The bark is dark, firm, smooth and in close ridges. The      acorn is small and carries a light brown, striped nut, wider than      long and bitter. The cup is shallow, enclosing only the base of the      nut.    [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Pin Oaks in Winter.]    Form and size: The pin oak is a medium-sized tree in comparison with      other oaks. It develops a tall, straight trunk that tapers      continuously through a pyramidal crown of low, drooping tender,      branches.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: It requires a deep, rich, moist soil and grows      naturally near swamps. Its roots are deep and spreading. The tree      grows rapidly and is easily transplanted.    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: The pin oak is an extremely graceful tree and is      therefore extensively used for planting on lawns and on certain      streets where the tree can find plenty of water and where conditions      will permit its branches to droop low.    Commercial value: The wood is heavy and hard but coarse grained and      liable to check and warp. Its principal use is in the construction      of houses and for shingles.    [Illustration: FIG. 64.--Leaf and Fruit of Pin Oak.]      CHESTNUT (_Castanea dentata_)    Distinguishing characters: The *bark* in young trees is smooth and of a      marked reddish-bronze color, but when the tree grows older, the bark      breaks up into *diamond-shaped ridges*, sufficiently characteristic      to distinguish the tree at a glance, see Fig. 65. A close      examination of the _terminal twig_ will show _three ridges_ and _two      grooves_ running down along the stem from the base of each leaf or      leaf-scar. The twig has no true terminal bud. The fruit, a large,      round *bur*, prickly without and hairy within and enclosing the      familiar dark brown, sweet edible nuts is also a distinguishing mark      of the tree.    Leaf: The leaves are distinctly long and narrow. They are from 6 to 8      inches long.    Form and size: The chestnut is a large tree with a massive trunk and      broad spreading crown. The chestnut tree when cut, sprouts readily      from the stump and therefore in places where the trees have once      been cut, a group of two to six trees may be seen emerging from the      old stump.    [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Trunk of Chestnut Tree.]    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: It will grow on rocky as well as on fertile soils and      requires plenty of light.    Enemies: During the past nine years nearly all the chestnut trees in the      United States have been attacked by a fungus disease (_Diaporthe      parasitica_, Mur.) which still threatens the entire extinction of      the chestnut trees in this country. No remedy has been discovered      and all affected trees should be cut down and the wood utilized      before it decays and becomes worthless. No species of chestnut tree      is entirely immune from this disease, though some species are highly      resistant.    Value for planting: The chestnut is one of the most rapidly growing      hardwood trees but, on account of its disease, which is now      prevalent everywhere, it is not wise to plant chestnut trees for the      present.    Commercial value: The wood is light, not very strong and liable to warp.      It is durable when brought in contact with the soil and is therefore      used for railroad ties, fence-posts, poles, and mine timbers. It is      also valuable for interior finish in houses and for fuel. Its bark      is used in the manufacture of tanning extracts and the nuts are sold      in cities in large quantities.          CHAPTER III    HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)        GROUP IX. THE HICKORIES, WALNUT AND BUTTERNUT    How to tell them from other trees and from each other: The hickory      trees, though symmetrical, have a rugged _appearance_ and the      _branches_ are so sturdy and black as to give a special distinction      to this group. The _buds_ are different from the buds of all other      trees and sufficiently characteristic to distinguish the various      species of the group. The _bark_ is also a distinguishing character.        The walnut and butternut have _chambered piths_ which distinguish      them from all other trees and from each other.      SHAGBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria ovata_)    Distinguishing characters: The yellowish brown *buds* nearly as large as      those of the mockernut hickory, _are each provided with two long,      dark, outer scales_ which stand out very conspicuously as shown in      Fig. 67. The *bark* in older specimens *shags* off in rough strips,      sometimes more than a foot long, as shown in Fig. 68. These two      characters will readily distinguish the tree at all seasons of the      year.    [Illustration: FIG. 66.--A Shagbark Hickory Tree.]    Leaf: The leaf is compound, consisting of 5 or 7 leaflets, the terminal      one generally larger.    Form and size: A tall, stately tree--the tallest of the hickories--of      rugged form and fine symmetry, see Fig. 66.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: The shagbark hickory grows in a great variety of      soils, but prefers a deep and rather moist soil.    Enemies: The _hickory bark borer_ (_Scolytus quadrispinosus_) is its      principal enemy. The insect is now killing thousands of hickory      trees in the vicinity of New York City and on several occasions has      made its appearance in large numbers in other parts of the country.    Value for planting: It is difficult to transplant, grows slowly and is      seldom found in nurseries.    [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Bud of the Shagbark Hickory.]    Commercial value: The wood is extremely tough and hard and is used for      agricultural implements and for the manufacture of wagons. It is      excellent for fuel and the nuts are of great value as a food.    Other characters: The fruit is a nut covered by a thick husk that      separates into 4 or 5 segments. The kernel is sweet.    Other common names: _Shellbark hickory_.      MOCKERNUT HICKORY (_Hicoria alba_)    [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Bark of the Shagbark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#8)"],[1,"Order moved      P. Fr. Miguel and myself into another separate house at the      other edge of the Parian. So that there stood between Santo      Domingo and San Gabriel, which is the name of this church      of the Chinese, the whole of the Parian of the Sangleys. And      there a poor little church was built under the protection of      San Gabriel, to whom it fell by lot, and a poor house where      we two lived. We entered into it at the beginning of September      1588. This was the first church for the Chinese built, and we      believe that there is today not another parish church [for      the Chinese] but that.... And P. Fr. Miguel catechized them      and preached to them in their Chinese language, and taught      the doctrine in it. I myself did not yet know the language,      but the Lord has been served, so that in a short time I      progressed in it.\" [107]      The account of Aduarte is not so accurate in some details, but  it supplies others not mentioned by Cobo. The first mission which  Benavides and Maldonado (or de San Pedro Martyr as he was later known)  built was near the village of Tondo, in a new settlement specially  founded for Christian Chinese, called Baybay, and it was named for Our  Lady of the Purification. The second mission which was established  by Benavides and Cobo was at first a palm-leaf hut. The name of San  Gabriel was decided upon by making lots with the names of various  saints on them and then drawing. San Gabriel came out three times in  a row, and \"all were persuaded that the Lord was pleased to have the  patronage belong to this holy archangel.\" Soon, because of the good  works of the fathers who established a hospital there for the care  of the sick and poor, the demands upon the hut became so great that  a larger building was planned. At first it was to have been erected  on the site of the hut, but the inhabitants protested that a stone  building so near native houses might do them great damage in the  event of an earthquake, so the friars went to the other side of the  river, and there built a temporary building of wood which was later  completed in stone. It was here then that the Doctrina was printed,  in the Church of San Gabriel, near the Parian of Manila, at the edge  of the Chinese settlement.    Under the care of Benavides and Cobo the mission flourished,  and the two fathers became increasingly proficient in the Chinese  language. When the provincial Juan de Castro began making preparations  for an inspection tour of his Chinese vicariate in 1590, he chose as  his companion Miguel de Benavides. The account of the events leading  up to this expedition is given in the already quoted letter of Salazar  on the Chinese:          \"Of the Dominican religious who came to these islands, four      are engaged in ministering to the Sangleys. Two of these      four officiate in the Church of San Gabriel, which, together      with the house where the religious live, stands close to the      Parian. Another church with its house is on the promontory      of Baybay, near Tondo--which a river divides, separating it      from Manila. Two of the four have learned the language of      the Sangleys so well, and one of these two how to write also      (which is the most difficult part of the language), that the      Sangleys wonder at their knowledge.... After due consideration      of the matter, the Dominican fathers and myself decided that      it was necessary to go to China.... Thus we decided upon the      departure, sending at present no more than two religious: Fray      Miguel de Benavides, who was the first to learn the language      of the Sangleys; and Father Juan de Castro, who came as vicar      of the religious and who was made provincial here. We preferred      these two, as one is well acquainted with the language, and the      other is much loved and esteemed by the Sangleys on account of      his venerable gray locks and blessed old age; and we know that      in that land old people are much respected and revered.\" [108]      They sailed on May 22, 1590, but Juan de Castro before he left  appointed Cobo acting superior of the province with full authority  during his absence, and in the latter's place as head of the Chinese  mission sent Juan de San Pedro Martyr.    There is no doubt but that at this time Benavides and Cobo were  the two outstanding Chinese linguists among the Spaniards in  the Philippines. To Benavides has been attributed [109] a Chinese  dictionary, and Schilling [110] uses the already quoted letter of Cobo  to prove that he also wrote a Doctrina in Chinese, but, granting that  such works were written by him, there is no evidence that they were  written in Chinese characters, and not in Chinese transliterated into  roman letters. The available evidence points to the fact that Cobo  was the only one who could then write in Chinese characters. Salazar  in his above quoted letter had said that \"one of these two [have  learned] how to write also,\" and in the same letter he continued,  \"Fray Juan Cobo, the Dominican religious--who, as I have said before,  knows the language of the Sangleys and their writing, and who is most  esteemed by them--is sending to Your Majesty a book, one of a number  brought to him from China.\" [111] Further witness to Cobo's amazing  knowledge of Chinese writing is given by Aduarte:          \"He knew three thousand Chinese characters, each different      from all the rest, for the Chinese have no definite number      of letters nor alphabet.... He translated a number [of      Chinese books]; for like those of Seneca, though they are      the work of heathens, they contain many profound sayings      like ours. He taught astrology to some of them whom he found      capable of learning; and to bring them by all means to their      salvation also taught them some trades that are necessary      among Spaniards, but which, not being used by the Chinese,      they did not know--such as painting images, binding books,      cutting and sewing clothes, and such things--doing all to      win men to God.\" [112]      Finally, as a more definite proof that Cobo could have been the  author of the Chinese Doctrina of 1593, we have the record [113] of a  _Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristiana en Lengua China_ written by him,  as well as many other works in Chinese.    In May 1590, then, the most accomplished Sinologist yet to work in  the Philippines was in charge of the Dominican province. \"His first  act,\" wrote Aduarte, \"was to strengthen the ministry to the Chinese by  appointing to it Father Domingo de Nieva, a priest of great virtue and  very able--which was tremendously important there--and one who best  mastered that language, as well as that of the Indians in which he  had had experience; and he worked in both of them, and wrote much  to the great advantage of those who came after him.\" [114] It is  surprising that no previous writer has emphasized the presence of  Domingo de Nieva, whose proficiency in Tagalog we have already noted,  at San Gabriel during the years when the printing of the Doctrinas  must have been planned and executed. His works are cited by Fernandez,  [115] and after giving a summary of his career, Aduarte added:          \"He wrote much in the language of the Indians and other things      in the language of the Chinese for whom he had printed in      their language and characters a memorial upon the Christian      life, with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation, in      preparation for the holy sacraments, of confession and the      sacred communion. He was an enemy of sloth, and so worked      much in Chinese, in which he wrote a practically new grammar      of the Chinese language, a vocabulary, a manual of confession      and many sermons, in order that those who had to learn this      language might find it less difficult.\" [116]      Medina [117] records these various works as Manila imprints of unknown  date, and to this indefinite information about them we can add nothing  positive. However, it is apparent that some time before 1606, when  Nieva died on his way to Mexico, he had had books printed, and since  they were in Chinese they must have been printed from wood-blocks,  for at that early date it would have been impossible to have cast the  number of characters necessary to print in Chinese with movable type.    With Nieva was Maldonado, or San Pedro Martyr. He had been one of the  first associates of Benavides in the first Chinese mission at Baybay,  but after the arrival of Cobo he had been sent by order of the first  chapter to Pangasinan. When Cobo was appointed acting provincial  San Pedro Martyr was again assigned to the Chinese ministry. He had  learned Tagalog, and after his return to the Parian \"he learned more  words of the Chinese language than any other member of the order,  though he was not successful with the pronunciation.\" [118]    On May 31, 1592, the Governor received a letter from the Emperor of  Japan demanding that an ambassador be sent to offer him the fealty  of the Philippines. Juan Cobo, as the best speaker of Chinese, was  chosen to represent the Spaniards, and he left Manila on July 29,  1592. After successfully convincing the Japanese Emperor of the amity  of the Spaniards, he left to come back to Manila, but his ship was  wrecked in November on the coast of Formosa, and there Cobo was killed  by hostile natives. Meanwhile Benavides had gone back to Spain with  Bishop Salazar in 1591, and did not return to the Philippines until  after his appointment as Bishop of Nueva Segovia in 1595.    That left as the only two remaining experts in the Chinese language,  Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr, both of whom were at  San Gabriel in 1592. _Moreover, both of them knew Chinese and Tagalog._  A text in Tagalog was available, based on the Talavera-Plasencia-Oliver  model, which had circulated freely, and this, we believe, was further  edited--hence "]]]
