The king replied that he knew of no man who  would be better fitted for this undertaking, \"and in thy hands the cause  will surely prosper.\" \"This can only be,\" said Leif, \"if I enjoy the grace  of your protection.\" Leif put to sea when his ship was ready for the  voyage. For a long time he was tossed about upon the ocean, and came upon  lands of which he had previously had no knowledge. There were self-sown  wheat[25-3] fields and vines growing there. There were also those trees  there which are called \"mausur,\"[25-4] and of all these they took  specimens. Some of the timbers were so large that they were used in  building. Leif found men upon a wreck, and took them home with him, and  procured quarters for them all during the winter. In this wise he showed  his nobleness and goodness, since he introduced Christianity into the  country, and saved the men from the wreck; and he was called Leif the  Lucky ever after. Leif landed in Ericsfirth, and then went home to  Brattahlid; he was well received by every one. He soon proclaimed  Christianity throughout the land, and the Catholic faith, and announced  King Olaf Tryggvason's messages to the people, telling them how much  excellence and how great glory accompanied this faith. Eric was slow in  forming the determination to forsake his old belief, but Thiodhild[26-1]  embraced the faith promptly, and caused a church to be built at some  distance from the house. This building was called Thiodhild's Church, and  there she and those persons who had accepted Christianity, and they were  many, were wont to offer their prayers. Thiodhild would not have  intercourse with Eric after that she had received the faith, whereat he  was sorely vexed.    At this time there began to be much talk about a voyage of exploration to  that country which Leif had discovered. The leader of this expedition was  Thorstein Ericsson, who was a good man and an intelligent, and blessed  with many friends. Eric was likewise invited to join them, for the men  believed that his luck and foresight would be of great furtherance. He  was slow in deciding, but did not say nay, when his friends besought him  to go. They thereupon equipped that ship in which Thorbiorn had come out,  and twenty men were selected for the expedition. They took little cargo  with them, nought else save their weapons and provisions. On that morning  when Eric set out from his home he took with him a little chest  containing gold and silver; he hid this treasure, and then went his way.  He had proceeded but a short distance, however, when he fell from his  horse and broke his ribs and dislocated his shoulder, whereat he cried  \"Ai, ai!\" By reason of this accident he sent his wife word that she  should procure the treasure which he had concealed, for to the hiding of  the treasure he attributed his misfortune. Thereafter they sailed  cheerily out of Ericsfirth in high spirits over their plan. They were  long tossed about upon the ocean, and could not lay the course they  wished. They came in sight of Iceland, and likewise saw birds from the  Irish coast.[27-1] Their ship was, in sooth, driven hither and thither  over the sea. In the autumn they turned back, worn out by toil, and  exposure to the elements, and exhausted by their labors, and arrived at  Ericsfirth at the very beginning of winter. Then said Eric, \"More  cheerful were we in the summer, when we put out of the firth, but we  still live, and it might have been much worse.\" Thorstein answers, \"It  will be a princely deed to endeavor to look well after the wants of all  these men who are now in need, and to make provision for them during the  winter.\" Eric answers, \"It is ever true, as it is said, that 'it is never  clear ere the answer comes,' and so it must be here. We will act now upon  thy counsel in this matter.\" All of the men, who were not otherwise  provided for, accompanied the father and son. They landed thereupon, and  went home to Brattahlid, where they remained throughout the winter.    _Thorstein Ericsson weds Gudrid; Apparitions._--Now it is to be told that  Thorstein Ericsson sought Gudrid, Thorbiorn's daughter, in wedlock. His  suit was favorably received both by herself and by her father, and it was  decided that Thorstein should marry Gudrid, and the wedding was held at  Brattahlid in the autumn. The entertainment sped well, and was very  numerously attended. Thorstein had a home in the Western Settlement at a  certain farmstead, which is called Lysufirth. A half interest in this  property belonged to a man named Thorstein, whose wife's name was Sigrid.  Thorstein went to Lysufirth, in the autumn, to his namesake, and Gudrid  bore him company. They were well received, and remained there during the  winter. It came to pass that sickness appeared in their home early in the  winter. Gard was the name of the overseer there; he had few friends; he  fell sick first, and died. It was not long before one after another fell  sick and died. Then Thorstein, Eric's son, fell sick, and Sigrid, the  wife of Thorstein, his namesake; and one evening Sigrid wished to go to  the house, which stood over against the outer-door, and Gudrid  accompanied her; they were facing the outer-door when Sigrid uttered a  loud cry. \"We have acted thoughtlessly,\" exclaimed Gudrid, \"yet thou  needest not cry, though the cold strikes thee; let us go in again as  speedily as possible.\" Sigrid answers, \"This may not be in this present  plight. All of the dead folk are drawn up here before the door now; among  them I see thy husband, Thorstein, and I can see myself there, and it is  distressful to look upon.\" But directly this had passed she exclaimed,  \"Let us go now, Gudrid; I no longer see the band!\" The overseer had  vanished from her sight, whereas it had seemed to her before that he  stood with a whip in his hand and made as if he would scourge the flock.  So they went in, and ere the morning came she was dead, and a coffin was  made ready for the corpse; and that same day the men planned to row out  to fish, and Thorstein accompanied them to the landing-place, and in the  twilight he went down to see their catch. Thorstein, Eric's son, then  sent word to his namesake that he should come to him, saying that all was  not as it should be there, for the housewife was endeavoring to rise to  her feet, and wished to get in under the clothes beside him, and when he  entered the room she was come up on the edge of the bed. He thereupon  seized her hands and held a pole-axe[28-1] before her breast. Thorstein,  Eric's son, died before night-fall. Thorstein, the master of the house,  bade Gudrid lie down and sleep, saying that he would keep watch over the  bodies during the night; thus she did, and early in the night, Thorstein,  Eric's son, sat up and spoke saying that he desired Gudrid to be called  thither, for that it was his wish to speak to her: \"It is God's will that  this hour be given me for my own and for the betterment of my condition.\"  Thorstein, the master, went in search of Gudrid, and waked her, and bade  her cross herself, and pray God to help her; \"Thorstein, Eric's son, has  said to me that he wishes to see thee; thou must take counsel with  thyself now, what thou wilt do, for I have no advice to give thee.\" She  replies, \"It may be that this is intended to be one of those incidents  which shall afterward be held in remembrance, this strange event, and it  is my trust that God will keep watch over me; wherefore, under God's  mercy, I shall venture to him and learn what it is that he would say, for  I may not escape this if it be designed to bring me harm. I will do this,  lest he go further, for it is my belief that the matter is a grave one.\"  So Gudrid went and drew near to Thorstein, and he seemed to her to be  weeping. He spoke a few words in her ear, in a low tone, so that she  alone could hear them; but this he said so that all could hear, that  those persons would be blessed who kept well the faith, and that it  carried with it all help and consolation, and yet many there were, said  he, who kept it but ill. \"This is no proper usage which has obtained here  in Greenland since Christianity was introduced here, to inter men in  unconsecrated earth, with nought but a brief funeral service. It is my  wish that I be conveyed to the church, together with the others who have  died here; Gard, however, I would have you burn upon a pyre, as speedily  as possible, since he has been the cause of all of the apparitions which  have been seen here during the winter.\" He spoke to her also of her own  destiny, and said that she had a notable future in store for her, but he  bade her beware of marrying any Greenlander; he directed her also to give  their property to the church and to the poor, and then sank down again a  second time. It had been the custom in Greenland, after Christianity was  introduced there, to bury persons on the farmsteads where they died, in  unconsecrated earth; a pole was erected in the ground, touching the  breast of the dead, and subsequently, when the priests came thither, the  pole was withdrawn and holy water poured in [the orifice], and the  funeral service held there, although it might be long thereafter. The  bodies of the dead were conveyed to the church at Ericsfirth, and the  funeral services held there by the clergy. Thorbiorn died soon after  this, and all of his property then passed into Gudrid's possession. Eric  took her to his home and carefully looked after her affairs.    _Concerning Thord of Hoefdi._--There was a man named Thord, who lived at  Hoefdi on Hoefdi-strands. He married Fridgerd, daughter of Thori the  Loiterer and Fridgerd, daughter of Kiarval the King of the Irish. Thord  was a son of Biorn Chestbutter, son of Thorvald Spine, Asleik's son, the  son of Biorn Iron-si"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#8)"],[1,"way, if possible.\"    \"Small blame to you for that. I had a girl in Dodger's room last year  who used to sew for a livin'. Early and late she worked, poor thing,  and she couldn't make but two dollars a week.\"    \"How could she live?\" asked Florence, startled, for she knew very  little of the starvation wages paid to toiling women.    \"She didn't live. She just faded away, and it's my belief the poor  thing didn't get enough to eat. Every day or two I'd make an excuse to  take her in something from my own table, a plate of meat, or a bit of  toast and a cup of tay, makin' belave she didn't get a chance to cook  for herself, but she got thinner and thinner, and her poor cheeks got  hollow, and she died in the hospital at last.\"    The warm-hearted apple-woman wiped away a tear with the corner of her  apron, as she thought of the poor girl whose sad fate she described.    \"You won't die of consumption, Mrs. O'Keefe,\" said Dodger. \"It'll take  a good while for you to fade away.\"    \"Hear him now,\" said the apple-woman, laughing. \"He will have his  joke, Miss Florence, but he's a good bye for all that, and I'm glad  he's goin' to lave Tim Bolton, that ould thafe of the worruld.\"    \"Now, Mrs. O'Keefe, you know you'd marry Tim if he'd only ask you.\"    \"Marry him, is it? I'd lay my broom over his head if he had the  impudence to ask me. When Maggie O'Keefe marries ag'in, she won't  marry a man wid a red nose.\"    \"Break it gently to him, Mrs. O'Keefe. Tim is just the man to break  his heart for love of you.\"    Mrs. O'Keefe aimed a blow at Dodger, but he proved true to his name,  and skillfully evaded it.    \"I must be goin',\" he said. \"I've got to work, or I can't pay room  rent when the week comes round.\"    \"What are you going to do, Dodger?\" asked Florence.    \"It isn't time for the evenin' papers yet, so I shall go 'round to the  piers and see if I can't get a job at smashin' baggage.\"    \"But I shouldn't think any one would want to do that,\" said Florence,  puzzled.    \"It's what we boys call it. It's just carryin' valises and bundles.  Sometimes I show strangers the way to Broadway. Last week an old man  paid me a dollar to show him the way to the Cooper Institute. He was a  gentleman, he was. I'd like to meet him ag'in. Good-by, Miss Florence;  I'll be back some time this afternoon.\"    \"And I must be goin', too,\" said Mrs. O'Keefe. \"I can't depend on that  Kitty; she's a wild slip of a girl, and just as like as not I'll find  a dozen apples stole when I get back. I hope you won't feel lonely, my  dear.\"    \"I think I will lie down a while,\" said Florence. \"I have a headache.\"    She threw herself on the bed, and a feeling of loneliness and  desolation came over her.    Her new friends were kind, but they could not make up to her for her  uncle's love, so strangely lost, and the home she had left behind.          Chapter X.  The Arch Conspirator.      In the house on Madison Avenue, Curtis Waring was left in possession  of the field. Through his machinations Florence had been driven from  home and disinherited.    He was left sole heir to his uncle's large property with the prospect  of soon succeeding, for though only fifty-four, John Linden looked at  least ten years older, and was as feeble as many men past seventy.    Yet, as Curtis seated himself at the breakfast table an hour after  Florence had left the house, he looked far from happy or triumphant.    One thing he had not succeeded in, the conquest of his cousin's heart.  Though he loved himself best, he was really in love with Florence, so  far as he was capable of being in love with any one.    She was only half his age--scarcely that--but he persuaded himself  that the match was in every way suitable.    He liked to fancy her at the head of his table, after the death of his  uncle, which he anticipated in a few months at latest.    The more she appeared to dislike him, the more he determined to marry  her, even against her will.    She was the only one likely to inherit John Linden's wealth, and by  marrying her he would make sure of it.    Yet she had been willing to leave the home of her youth, to renounce  luxury for a life of poverty, rather than to marry him.    When he thought of this his face became set and its expression stern  and determined.    \"Florence shall yet be mine,\" he declared, resolutely. \"I will yet be  master of her fate, and bend her to my will. Foolish girl, how dare  she match her puny strength against the resolute will of Curtis  Waring?\"    \"Was there any one else whom she loved?\" he asked himself, anxiously.  No, he could think of none. On account of his uncle's chronic  invalidism, they had neither gone into society, nor entertained  visitors, and in the midst of a great city Florence and her uncle had  practically led the lives of recluses.    There had been no opportunity to meet young men who might have proved  claimants for her hand.    \"When did Miss Florence leave the house, Jane?\" he inquired, as he  seated himself at the table.    \"Most an hour since,\" the girl answered, coldly, for she disliked  Curtis as much as she loved and admired Florence.    \"It is sad, very sad that she should be so headstrong,\" said Curtis,  with hypocritical sorrow.    \"It is sad for her to go away from her own uncle's house,\" returned  Jane.    \"And very--very foolish.\"    \"I don't know about that, sir. She had her reasons,\" said Jane,  significantly.    Curtis coughed.    He had no doubt that Florence had talked over the matter with her  hand-maiden.    \"Did she say where she was going, Jane?\" he asked.    \"I don't think the poor child knew herself, sir.\"    \"Did she go alone?\"    \"No, sir; the boy that was here last night called for her.\"    \"That ragamuffin!\" said Curtis, scornfully. \"She certainly shows  extraordinary taste for a young lady of family.\"    \"The boy seems a very kind and respectable boy,\" said Jane, who had  been quite won by Dodger's kindness to her young mistress.    \"He may be respectable, though I am not so sure of that; but his  position in life is very humble. He is probably a bootblack; a  singular person to select for the friend of a girl like Florence.\"    \"There's them that stands higher that isn't half so good,\" retorted  Jane, with more zeal than good grammar.    \"Did Miss Florence take a cab?\"    \"No; she just walked.\"    \"But she took some clothing with her?\"    \"She took a handbag--that is all. She will send for her trunk.\"    \"If you find out where she is living, just let me know, Jane.\"    \"I will if she is willing to have me,\" answered Jane, independently.    \"Look here, Jane,\" said Curtis, angrily, \"don't forget that you are  not her servant, but my uncle's. It is to him you look for wages, not  to Miss Florence.\"    \"I don't need to be told that, sir. I know that well enough.\"    \"Then you know that it is to him that your faithful services are due,  not to Florence?\"    \"I'm faithful to both, Mr. Waring.\"    \"You are aware that my uncle is justly displeased with my cousin?\"    \"I know he's displeased, but I am sure he has no good reason to be.\"    Curtis Waring bit his lips. The girl, servant as she was, seemed to be  openly defying him. His imperious temper could ill brook this.    \"Take care!\" he said, with a frown. \"You seem to be lacking in respect  to me. You don't appear to understand my position in this house.\"    \"Oh, yes, I do. I know you have schemed to get my poor young mistress  out of the house, and have succeeded.\"    \"I have a great mind to discharge you, girl,\" said Curtis, with  lowering brow.    \"I am not your servant, sir. You have nothing to do with me.\"    \"You will see whether I have or not. I will let you remain for a time,  as it is your attachment to Miss Florence that has made you forget  yourself. You will find that it is for your interest to treat me  respectfully.\"    A feeble step was heard at the door, and John Linden entered the  breakfast-room. His face was sad, and he heaved a sigh as he glanced  mechanically at the head of the table, where Florence usually sat.    Curtis Waring sprang to his feet, and placing himself at his uncle's  side, led him to his seat.    \"How do you feel this morning, uncle?\" he asked, with feigned  solicitude.    \"Ill, Curtis. I didn't sleep well last night.\"    \"I don't wonder, sir. You had much to try you.\"    \"Is--is Florence here?\"    \"No, sir,\" answered Jane, promptly. \"She left the house an hour ago.\"    A look of pain appeared on John Linden's pale face.    \"Did--did she leave a message for me?\" he asked, slowly.    \"She asked me to bid you good-by for her,\" answered Jane, quickly.    \"Uncle, don't let yourself be disturbed now with painful thoughts. Eat  your breakfast first, and then we will speak of Florence.\"    John Linden ate a very light breakfast. He seemed to have lost his  appetite and merely toyed with his food.    When he arose from the table, Curtis supported him to the library.    \"It is very painful to me--this conduct of Florence's, Curtis,\" he  said, as he sank into his armchair.    \"I understand it fully, uncle,\" said Curtis. \"When I think of it, it  makes me very angry with the misguided girl.\"    \"Perhaps I have been too harsh--too stern!\"    \"You, uncle, too harsh! Why, you are the soul of gentleness. Florence  has shown herself very ungrateful.\"    \"Yet, Curtis, I love that girl. Her mother seemed to live again in  her. Have I not acted cruelly in requiring her to obey me or leave the  house?\"    \"You have acted only for good. You are seeking her happiness.\"    \"You really think this, Curtis?\"    \"I am sure of it.\"    \"But how will it all end?\" asked Linden, bending an anxious look upon  his wily nephew.    \"By Florence yielding.\"    \"You are sure of that?\"    \"Yes. Listen, uncle; Florence is only capricious, like most girls of  her age. She foolishly desires to have her own way. It is nothing more  serious, I can assure you.\"    \"But she has left the house. That seems to show that she is in  earnest.\" "]]]
