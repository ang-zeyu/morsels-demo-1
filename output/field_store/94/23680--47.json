They hoped no white  man would ride alive to Laramie. It made cheerful listening to Buddy,  flat on his stomach in the roof of the dugout!    After a while, when the cabin had been gutted of everything it contained  save the crude table and benches, a few Indians brought burning brands  from the stable and set it afire. They were very busy inside and out,  making sure that the flames took hold properly. Then, when the dry logs  began to blaze and flames licked the edges of the roof, they stood back  and watched it.    Buddy saw Hides-the-face glance speculatively toward the dugout, and  slipped his hand back where he could reach his six-shooter. He felt  pretty certain that they meant to demolish the dugout next, and he  knew exactly what he meant to do. He had heard men at the posts talk of  \"selling their lives dearly \", and that is what he intended to do.    He was not going to be in too much of a hurry; he would wait until they  actually began on the dugout--and when they were on the bank within a  few feet of him, and he saw that there was no getting away from death,  he meant to shoot five Indians, and himself last of all.    Tentatively he felt of his temple where he meant to place the muzzle  of the gun when there was just one bullet left. It was so nice and  smooth--he wondered if God would really help him out, if he said Our  Father with a pure heart and with faith, as his mother said one must  pray. He was slightly doubtful of both conditions, when he came to think  of it seriously. This spring he had felt grown-up enough to swear a  little at the horses, sometimes--and he was not sure that shooting the  Indian that time would not be counted a crime by God, who loved all  His creatures. Mother always stuck to it that Injuns were God's  creatures--which brought Buddy squarely against the incredible  assumption that God must love them. He did not in the least mean to be  irreverent, but when he watched those painted bucks his opinion of God  changed slightly. He decided that he himself was neither pure nor full  of faith, and that he would not pray just yet. He would let God go ahead  and do as He pleased about it; except that Buddy would never let those  Indians get him alive, no matter what God expected.    Hides-the-face walked over toward the dugout. Buddy crooked his left arm  and laid the gun barrel across it to get a \"dead rest\" and leave nothing  to chance. Hides-the-face stared at the dugout, moved to one side--and  the muzzle of the gun followed, keeping its aim directly at the left  edge of his breastbone as outlined with the red paint. Hides-the-face  craned, stepped into the path down the bank and passed out of range.  Buddy gritted his teeth malevolently and waited, his ears strained  to catch and interpret the meaning of every soft sound made by  Hides-the-face's moccasins.    Hides-the-face cautiously pushed open the door of the cellar and looked  in, standing for interminable minutes, as is the leisurely way of  Indians when there is no great need of haste. Ruddy cautiously lowered  his face and peered down like a mouse from the thatch, but he could not  handily bring his gun to bear upon Hides-the-face, who presently turned  back and went up the path, his shoulder-muscles moving snakishly under  his brown skin as he climbed the bank.    Hides-the-face returned to the others and announced that there was a  place where they could camp. Buddy could not hear all that he said, and  Hides-the-face had his back turned so that not all of his signs were  intelligible; but he gathered that these particular Indians had chosen  or had been ordered to wait here for three suns, and that the cellar  appealed to Hides-the-face as a shelter in case it stormed.    Buddy did not know whether to rejoice at the news or to mourn. They  would not destroy the dugout, so he need not shoot himself, which was of  course a relief. Still, three suns meant three days and nights, and the  prospect of lying there on his stomach, afraid to move for that length  of time, almost amounted to the same thing in the end. He did not  believe that he could hold out that long, though of course he would try  pretty hard.    All that day Buddy lay watching through the crack, determined to take  any chance that came his way. None came. The Indians loitered in the  shade, and some slept. But always two or three remained awake; and  although they sat apparently ready to doze off at any minute, Buddy knew  them too well to hope for such good luck. Two Indians rode in toward  evening dragging a calf that had been overlooked in the roundup; and  having improvidently burned the cabin, the meat was cooked over the  embers which still smouldered in places where knots in the logs made  slow fuel.    Buddy watched them hungrily, wondering how long it took to starve.    When it was growing dark he tried to keep in mind the exact positions  of the Indians, and to discover whether a guard would be placed over  the camp, or whether they felt safe enough to sleep without a sentinel.  Hides-the-face he had long ago decided was in charge of the party, and  Hides-the-face was seemingly concerned only with gorging himself on  the half-roasted meat. Buddy hoped he would choke himself, but  Hides-the-face was very good at gulping half-chewed hunks and finished  without disaster.    Then he grunted something to someone in the dark, and there was movement  in the group. Buddy ground his growing \"second\" teeth together, clenched  his fist and said \"Damn it!\" three times in a silent crescendo of rage  because he could neither see nor hear what took place; and immediately  he repented his profanity, remembering that God could hear him.  In Buddy's opinion, you never could be sure about God; He bestowed  mysterious mercies and strange punishments, and His ways were past  finding out. Buddy tipped his palms together and repeated all the  prayers his mother had taught him and then, with a flash of memory,  finished with \"Oh, God, please!\" just as mother had done long ago on the  dry drive. After that he meditated uncomfortably for a few minutes  and added in a faint whisper, \"Oh, shucks! You don't want to pay any  attention to a fellow cussing a little when he's mad. I could easy make  that up if you helped me out some way.\"    Buddy believed afterwards that God yielded to persuasion and decided to  give him a chance. For not more than five minutes passed when a far-off  murmur grew to an indefinable roar, and the wind whooped down off the  Snowies so fiercely that even the dugout quivered a little and rattled  dirt down on Buddy through the poles just over his head.    At first this seemed an unlucky circumstance, for the Indians came down  into the dugout for shelter, and now Buddy was afraid to breathe in  the quiet intervals between the gusts. Just below him he could hear the  occasional mutters of laconic sentences and grunted answers as the bucks  settled themselves for the night, and he had a short, panicky spell of  fearing that the poles would give way beneath him and drop him in upon  them.    After a while--it seemed hours to Buddy--the wind settled down to a  steady gale. The Indians, so far as he could determine, were all asleep  in the cellar. And Buddy, setting his teeth hard together, began to  slide slowly backward toward the opening through which he had crawled  into the roof. When he had crawled in he had not noticed the springiness  of the poles, but now his imagination tormented him with the sensation  of sagging and swaying. When his feet pushed through the opening he had  to grit his teeth to hold himself steady. It seemed as if someone were  reaching up in the dark to catch him by the legs and pull him out.  Nothing happened, however, and after a little he inched backward until  he hung with his elbows hooked desperately inside the opening, his head  and shoulders within and protesting with every nerve against leaving the  shelter.    Buddy said afterwards that he guessed he'd have hung there until  daylight, only he was afraid it was about time to change guard, and  somebody might catch him. But he said he was scared to let go and drop,  because it must have been pretty crowded in the cellar, and he knew  the door was open, and some buck might be roosting outside handy to be  stepped on. But he knew he had to do something, because if he ever went  to sleep up in that place he'd snore, maybe; and anyway, he said, he'd  rather run himself to death than starve to death. So he dropped.    It was two days after that when Buddy shuffled into a mining camp on  the ridge just north of Douglas Pass. He was still on his feet, but  they dragged like an old man's. He had walked twenty-five miles in two  nights, going carefully, in fear of Indians. The first five miles he had  waded along the shore of the creek, he said, in case they might pick up  his tracks at the dugout and try to follow him. He had hidden himself  like a rabbit in the brush through the day, and he had not dared shoot  any meat, wherefore he had not eaten anything.    \"I ain't as hungry as I was at first,\" He grinned tremulously. \"But I  guess I better--eat. I don' want--to lose the--habit--\" Then he went  slack and a man swearing to hide his pity picked him up in his arms and  carried him into the tent.        CHAPTER SIX: THE YOUNG EAGLE MUST FLY    \"You're of age,\" said Bob Birnie, sucking hard at his pipe. \"You've had  your schooling as your mother wished that you should have it.

Pausing on a knoll, he surveyed the  scene around him, and took off his hat that the evening breeze might  cool his face. Suddenly, there came echoing through the forest, from  hill to hill, the deep notes of the _lur_. The traveler listened, and  then urged his horse forward. Again and again the blast reverberated,  the notes dying in low echoes on the distant hills. From another rise,  the rider saw the girl who was making all this wild music. She was  standing on a high knoll. Peering down into the forest, she recognized  the traveler and welcomed him with an attempt at a tune on her long,  wooden trumpet.    \"Good evening, Hansine,\" said he, as his horse scrambled up the path  close by, \"your _lur_ made welcome music this evening.\"    \"Good evening, Hr. Bogstad,\" said she, \"are you not lost?\"    \"I was, nearly, until I heard you calling your cows. It is a long way up  here--but the air and the scenery are grand.\"    \"Yes, do you think so? I don't know anything about what they call grand  scenery. I've always lived up here, and it's work, work all the  time--but those cows are slow coming home.\" She lifted her _lur_ to her  lips and once more made the woods ring.    Down at the foot of the hills, where the pines gave place to small,  grassy openings, stood a group of log huts, towards which the cows were  now seen wending.    \"Come, Hr. Bogstad, I see the cows are coming. I must go down to meet  them.\"    They went down the hill together. The lowing cows came up to the  stables, and as the herd grew larger there was a deafening din. A girl  was standing in the doorway of one of the cabins, timidly watching the  noisy herd.    \"Come, give the cows their salt,\" laughingly shouted Hansine to her.    \"And get hooked all to pieces? Not much.\"    \"You little coward. What good would you be on a _saeter_? What do you  think, Hr. Bogstad?\"    As the girl caught sight of the new arrival she started and the color  came to her face. He went up to her. \"How are you, Signe?\" he said. \"How  do you like life on a _saeter_?\"    \"Well, I hardly know,\" she said, seemingly quite embarrassed.    \"Oh, I'll tell you,\" broke in the busy Hansine, as she came with a pail  full of salt. \"She just goes around and looks at and talks about what  she calls the beauties of nature. That she likes; but as for milking, or  churning, or making cheese, well--\"    Then they all laughed good naturedly.    Hansine was a large, strong girl, with round, pleasant features. She and  the cows were good friends. At the sound of the _lur_ every afternoon  the cows turned their grazing heads towards home, and, on their arrival,  each was given a pat and a handful of salt. Then they went quietly into  their stalls.    It was quite late that evening before the milk had been strained into  the wooden platters and placed in rows on the shelves in the milk house.  Hr. Bogstad and Signe had proffered their help, but they had been  ordered into the house and Signe was told to prepare the evening meal.  When Hansine came in, she found the table set with the cheese, milk,  butter, and black bread, while Signe and Hr. Bogstad sat by the large  fireplace watching a pot of boiling cream mush.    The object of Hr. Bogstad's visit was plain enough. He had been devoting  his attentions to Signe Dahl for some time, and now that he was home  from college on a vacation, it was natural that he should follow her  from the village up to the mountains.    Hr. Bogstad, though young, was one of the rich men of Nordal. He had  lately fallen heir to a large estate. In fact, Signe's parents, with a  great many more, were but tenants of young Hr. Henrik Bogstad; and  although it was considered a great honor to have the attentions of such  a promising young man--for, in fact, Henrik was quite exemplary in all  things, and had a good name in the neighborhood--still Signe Dahl did  not care for him, and was uneasy in his company. She would rather sail  with some of the fisher boys on the lake than be the object of envy by  her companions. But Signe's slim, graceful form, large blue eyes, clear,  dimpled face, light silken hair, combined with a native grace and  beauty, attracted not only the fisher boys but the \"fine\" Hr. Bogstad  also. She was now spending a few days with her cousin Hansine in the  mountains. Her limited knowledge of _saeter_ life was fast being  augmented under her cousin's supervision, notwithstanding Hansine's  remarks about her inabilities.    The cabin wherein the three were seated was of the rudest kind, but  everything was scrupulously clean. The blazing pine log cast a red light  over them as they sat at the table.    \"So you see nothing grand in your surroundings?\" asked Hr. Bogstad of  Hansine.    \"How can I? I have never been far from home. Mountains and forests and  lakes are all I know.\"    \"True,\" said he, \"and we can see grandeur and beauty by contrast only.\"    \"But here is Signe,\" remarked Hansine; \"she has never seen much of the  world, yet you should hear her. I can never get her interested in my  cows. Her mind must have been far away when she dished up the mush, for  she has forgotten something.\"    \"Oh, I beg pardon,\" exclaimed the forgetful girl. \"Let me attend to it.\"    She went to the cupboard and brought out the sugar and a paper of ground  cinnamon, and sprinkled a layer of each over the plates of mush. Then  she pressed into the middle of each a lump of butter which soon melted  into a tiny yellow pond.    \"I should like to hear some of these ideas of yours,\" remarked the  visitor to Signe, who had so far forgotten her manners as to be blowing  her spoonful of mush before dipping it into the butter.    \"I wish I were an artist,\" said she, without seeming to notice his  remarks. \"Ah, what pictures I would paint! I would make them so natural  that you could see the pine tops wave, and smell the breath of the woods  as you looked at them.\"    \"You would put me in, standing on The Look-out blowing my _lur_,  wouldn't you?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"And I have no doubt that we could hear the echoes ringing over the  hills,\" continued Hansine, soberly.    \"Never mind, you needn't make fun. Yes, Hr. Bogstad, I think we have  some grand natural scenes. I often climb up on the hills, and sit and  look over the pines and the shining lake down towards home. Then,  sometimes, I can see the ocean like a silver ribbon, lying on the  horizon. I sit up there and gaze and think, as Hansine says, nearly all  night. I seem to be under a spell. You know it doesn't get dark all  night now, and the air is so delicious. My thoughts go out 'Over the  high mountains,' as Bjornson says, and I want to be away to hear and see  what the world is and has to tell me. A kind of sweet loneliness comes  over me which I cannot explain.\"    Hr. Bogstad had finished his dish. He, too, was under a spell--the spell  of a soft, musical voice.    \"Then the light in the summer,\" she continued. \"How I have wished to go  north where the sun shines the whole twenty-four hours. Have you ever  seen the Midnight Sun, Hr. Bogstad?\"    \"No; but I have been thinking of taking a trip up there this summer, if  I can get some good company to go with me. Wouldn't you--\"    It was then that Signe hurriedly pushed her chair away and said: \"Thanks  for the food.\"    Next morning Signe was very busy. She washed the wooden milk basins,  scalded them with juniper tea, and then scoured them with sand. She  churned the butter and wanted to help with the cheese, but Hansine  thought that she was not paying enough attention to their visitor, so  she ordered her off to her lookout on the mountain. Hr. Bogstad would  help her up the steep places; besides, he could tell her the names of  the ferns and flowers, and answer the thousand and one questions which  she was always asking. So, of course, they had to go.    But Signe was very quiet, and Henrik said but little. He had come to the  conclusion that he truly loved this girl whose parents were among the  poorest of his tenants. None other of his acquaintances, even among the  higher class, charmed him as did Signe. He was old enough to marry, and  she was not too young. He knew full well that if he did marry her, many  of his friends would criticise; but Henrik had some of the Norseman  spirit of liberty, and he did not think that a girl's humble position  barred her from him. True, he had received very little encouragement  from her, though her parents had looked with favor upon him. And now he  was thinking of her cold indifference.    They sat down on a rocky bank, carpeted with gray reindeer moss.    They had been talking of his experiences at school. He knew her desire  to finish the college education cut short by a lack of means.    \"Signe, I wish you would let me do you a favor.\"    She thought for a moment before she asked what it was.    \"Let me help you attend college. You know I am able to,  besides--besides, some day you may learn to think as much of me as I do  of you, and then, dear Signe--\"    Signe arose. \"Hr. Bogstad,\" she said, \"I wish you would not talk like  that. If you do, I shall go back to Hansine.\"    \"Why, Signe, don't be offended. I am not jesting.\" He stood before her  in the path, and would have taken her hand, but she drew back.    \"Signe, I have thought a great deal of you for a long time. You know we  have been boy and girl together. My absence at school has made no  difference in me. I wish you could think a little of me, Signe.\"    \"Hr. Bogstad, I don't believe in deceiving anyone. I am sorry that you  have been thinking like that about me, because I cannot think of you  other than as a friend. Let us not talk about it.\"    If Henrik could not talk about that nearest his heart, he would remain  silent, which he did.    Signe was gathering some rare ferns and mosses when Hansine's _lur_  sounded through the hills. That was the signal for them, as well as the  cows, to come home.    Early the next morning Hansine's brother "]]]
