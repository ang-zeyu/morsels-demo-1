Its absence from the  pancreatic juice of infants is an indication that starch should not be  given them. Another ferment, stearopsin, emulsifies fats. The bile is  alkaline and assists the pancreatic juice in neutralising the acid mixture  that leaves the stomach; it also assists the absorption of fats. The  digestion of proteids is not completed in the stomach. There are some who  look upon the stomach as chiefly of use as a receptacle for the large mass  of food, which is too quickly eaten to be passed at once into the  intestines; the food being gradually expelled from the stomach, in such  quantities as the duodenal digestion can adequately treat. A frequently  used table, showing the time required for the digestion of various foods  in the stomach, is of little practical value. There is ample provision for  the digestion of food, there is a duplication of ferments for the proteids  and starch. In health, the ferments are not only very active, but are  secreted in ample quantities. The digestive or unorganised ferments must  not be confused with the organised ferments such as yeast. The latter are  living vegetable cells, capable of indefinite multiplication. The former  are soluble bodies, and though capable of transforming or digesting some  thousands of times their mass of food, their power in this direction is  restricted within definite limits. Another and preferable name for them is  enzymes.    The action of saliva on starch is powerfully retarded by tea, this is due  to the tannin. Coffee and cocoa are without effect. Tea infused for two  minutes only, was not found to have sensibly less restraining effect than  when infused for thirty minutes. On peptic digestion both tea and coffee  had a powerful retarding effect. When of equal strength cocoa was nearly  as bad, but as it is usually taken much weaker, its inhibitory effect is  of little consequence.    Bacteria are minute vegetable organisms, which exist in the dust of the  air, in water and almost everywhere on or near the surface of the earth.  They are consequently taken in with our food. They exist in the mouth;  those in carious teeth are often sufficient to injuriously affect  digestion and health. The healthy gastric juice is to a great degree  antiseptic, but few bacteria being able to endure its acidity. When the  residue of the food reaches the large intestine, bacteria are found in  very great numbers. The warmth of the body is highly favourable to their  growth. They cause the food and intestinal _debris_ to assume its faecal  character. Should the mass be retained, the bacterial poisons accumutate  and being absorbed into the body produce headaches, exhaustion,  neurasthenia and other complaints. Proteid matter, the products of its  decomposition and nitrogenous matter generally, are especially the food of  bacteria; this is shown in the offensiveness of the faeces of the  carnivora, notwithstanding their short intestines, compared with that of  the herbivora. Also in the difference of the faeces of the dog when fed on  flesh and on a nearly vegetable diet. On a rich proteid diet, especially  if it consists largely of flesh, the bacterial products in the intestines  are greater than on a vegetable diet. On the latter such a disease as  appendicitis is rare. Professor Elie Metchnikoff, of the Pasteur  Institute, thinks that man's voluminous and highly developed large  intestine fulfils no useful purpose, and on account of its breeding a very  copious and varied bacterial flora, could with advantage be dispensed  with. He also has said that man, who could support himself on food easily  digestible, has a small intestine which is disproportionately fully  developed. Instead of having between 18 and 21 feet of small intestine,  man might do with one-third of that length. According to him, there is a  disharmony of our food and our digestive system. Referring to such views,  and the desire of some surgeons to remove the vermiform appendix and  portions of the intestines upon too little provocation, Sir W. Macewin,  M.D., F.R.S. (_B. Medical Jrn._, 1904, 2 p. 874) says:--\"Is this human  body of ours so badly constructed that it contains so many useless parts  and requires so much tinkering? Possibly I may be out of fashion with the  times, as I cannot find such imperfections in the normal human body as are  alleged. On the contrary, the more one looks into the human body and sees  it work, the better one understands it and the more one is struck with the  wondrous utility, beauty, and harmony of all its parts.\" Our food we can  change, but not our organs-except by a dangerous surgical operations. Our  teeth with our complex and very long intestines are adapted for fibrous,  bulky and solid food. On such food mankind has lived for an immense period  of time. It is true that there are several theoretical advantages in  cooked vegetable foods; but unfortunately there is a want of conformity  with our digestive organs. If a flesh diet is taken, the incongruity is  greater. Concentrated food causes constipation. An active man, leading an  out-of-door life, can take unsuitable food with little or no apparent  inconvenience, the movements of his body favouring intestinal action;  whilst the same food to a sedentary person will prove distinctly  injurious.    Some persons have such a vigorous digestion that they can consume almost  any food, even that which is obviously unsuitable; not only bad in kind  but excessive in quantity. Other persons have to be very careful. Many  have boasted that they can take of what they call the good things of life  to their full, without bad effect. We know of such men who have been much  esteemed for their joviality and good nature, but who have broken down in  what should have been a hearty and useful middle life. There are others  who were poorly equipped for the battle of life, with indifferent  constitutions, never having had the buoyancy and overflowing of animal  spirits; but who, by conserving such strength as they had, have outlived  all their more healthy but less careful comrades. The errors of the  parents are often most evident in the children or grandchildren. There  are many persons who cannot eat of some particular food, although it may  be quite wholesome to others. Sometimes it is a psychological rather than  a physiological disability, which may he overcome by an effort of the  will. At other times it seems to have no connection with the imagination,  although it is not always possible to give a sound reason for it. In the  main, of course, there are principles of dietetics applicable to all  alike, but in regard to details, everyone should make rules for himself,  according to his experience. When there appears no real reason for an  idiosyncrasy, a little humouring of our taste and digestion will often  overcome it, to our advantage. It is generally those of delicate  constitution who are most sensitive. Some cannot eat oatmeal except in  small quantity. Olive and other vegetable oils, even when of good quality  cannot be taken by many people, whilst others find them quite as  wholesome, or even better than butter. Vegetarians can generally detect  lard in pastry both by its taste and its after effects, although those  accustomed to this fat do not object to it. It is also surprising how some  individual's tastes and habits will vary at different periods of their  lives.    One form of dyspepsia is due to undigested starch remaining in the stomach  and causing an excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid. As long as  proteid food is present, the pepsin and acid expend themselves on it, and  are removed together. The undigested starch continues to stimulate gastric  secretion, and the acid residuum causes pain, heartburn and flatulence. If  there be also any butyric acid, or some other fatty acid, derived from  milk, butter, cheese, &c., there will be acid eructations. For this form  of indigestion there are several methods of treatment. First; the very  thorough cooking of all starchy food, and it is an advantage to take a  little good extract of malt, either at the time of eating or directly  afterwards. The diastase of the malt has the same action on starch as the  ptyalin in the saliva. It is better, scientifically, to have the  farinaceous food at about 130 deg. F. (as hot as the mouth can bear will  do), and then to add malt extract. On keeping the mixture warm, from a  few minutes to half an hour or more, the starch is digested and rendered  soluble. Such food is not very pleasant to take. The food known as Grape  Nuts has been treated in a similar manner. The use of malt extract,  however, seems a clumsy substitute for salivary digestion. Second; the  eating of starch in the form of hard and dry biscuits, crusts and other  hard food, which demand thorough mastication and insalivation, and the  keeping in the mouth for a long while, during which the saliva has time to  act. This is the best plan. Third; the taking of sodium bicarbonate  towards the end of the period of digestion, in order to neutralise the  acid in the stomach. This gives relief, but does not cure, as the dose has  to be repeated after each meal; in course of time the quantity of soda has  sometimes to be increased to an alarming extent. Fourth; the abstention  from starchy foods and the substitution of an exclusive flesh dietary. In  the \"Salisbury\" treatment, raw minced beef is given. This method often  gives immediate relief, but its ultimate effect on the kidneys and other  organs is very bad.    No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the number of meals into  which the daily amount of food required should be divided. The stomach  appears to work to the best advantage when it is full, or nearly so, and  the appetite is appeased. Three approximately equal meals seems to be a  convenient division.

[Illustration: CATARACTS AT LEOPOLDVILLE.]          CHAPTER III.    The Higher Congo.      Next day we make a formal call on Mr. Mahieu, Inspecteur d'Etat of the  Congo State, whose headquarters are at Leopoldville. He is a very busy  man with a multitude of duties, for the paternal system is continued all  through the State and the most trivial matters are always referred to  the highest official in the neighbourhood. As we are to lunch at the  Residency, we do not stay long, but take a ride with Commandant and Mme.  Sillye on four of the horses the former purchased at Dakar. Although a  little stiff after their holiday of a month, they have not been  otherwise affected by their sea voyage and two days in the train. Along  the beach are many steamers charging and discharging and others on the  slips being repaired or partly built. These steamers are all brought out  in sections and put together on the beach. They are flat bottomed, are  driven by stern wheels and only draw three or four feet of water. They  all burn wood, and special depots are formed at intervals on the rivers  where stores of this fuel are collected. Should however, a steamer run  short, it is only necessary to stop and send the crew ashore with knives  for the banks are lined with forest.    Leaving the beach we ride through avenues of palms and mango trees to  higher ground, whence a beautiful view can be obtained of Stanley Pool.  This is really a part of the river about sixteen miles wide, shut in by  hills on each side, but its size is not apparent from the water itself,  as a great number of islands cut the stream into numerous narrow  channels. Towards the south, the river narrows again and at this point  is the uppermost of the cataracts, the water hurling itself against the  rocks in its efforts to escape and recoiling in spray high into the air.  From just below Leopoldville all the way to Matadi, the river indeed  rushes down narrow gorges, but above, for nearly a thousand miles, it is  navigable for steamers. On a hill above the rapid, is a large tree under  which Stanley pitched his tent and which still bears his name.    Many native villages exist near Leopoldville, consisting of huts formed  of wooden frames and thatched with grass. There are no plantations or  factories here but great numbers of natives are at present employed in  road making and in constructing a new slip for launching the steamers.  Evidently our little party gives rise to much comment for several of  the natives have probably never seen a horse before, and a cavalcade of  four of these strange animals is something entirely new. On our way back  to the ship we pass down the main street in which are the administrative  offices, the mess, the doctors' and other private houses and close to  the beach, the Residency, over which flies the State flag and in front  of which patrols a sentry. At first one thought the sentry in front of  the chief official's house in each town, was merely a symbol of  authority as in Europe, afterwards however, it becomes apparent that the  system of Government in the Congo is based on absolute uniformity. Every  Post, however big or small, has its State flag and every chief official,  from the Governor to the chief of a Wood Post, has a sentry at his door.  Each morning at sunrise the flag is hoisted, while the guard presents  arms and every evening at sunset it is lowered with like ceremony.  Indeed, the whole system is military, for everyone rises, works, eats  and sleeps at the command of the clarion. It is a custom at most  official and private parties in the Congo, to hand round port wine and  cigars before sitting down to table. At first this seemed a strange kind  of _aperative_., but soon the glass of port became very agreeable after  the morning's work.    Ten or twelve guests were assembled on the verandah when we arrived, and  soon Mr. Armarni joined the group. He is an Italian, an ex-naval officer  of distinction and now Commissaire du Roi of the Congo, a position which  ranks with, but after, that of Governor General. By a simple and  practical device, the relative rank of all the Administrative and  Military officials can be determined at a glance. Each wears a blue  gauntlet on each wrist and forearm over the white sleeve of his coat and  affixed on this are a number of gold bands. A captain of a river  steamer, perhaps has three or four bands, a Chef de Poste, four or five,  a Commissaire of a Zone or District, seven or eight, an Inspecteur  d'Etat, nine or ten, and the Governor General, eleven. In order however,  to economise space and perhaps to facilitate counting, when more than  three stripes are worn, a broad strip is substituted which corresponds  to the original three. Thus an official with five stripes wears one  broad and two narrow ones, while the Governor General wears three broad  stripes and two narrow ones. The chief decoration, the order of the  Lion, can only be gained by Belgians, but the Congo Star is given to all  after a certain term of service. Those who hold purely civil  appointments such at Judges, Secretaries and Directors of Transport,  wear no stripes at all.    At 2.30 p.m. a bugle sounded and a chattering throng of natives hurried  past the Inspector's house towards the beach to resume work, which is  always interrupted for three hours at 11.30 a.m. during the heat of the  day. In order to feed these people and the soldiers of the Force  Publique at Leopoldville, about a ton and a half of kwanga is prepared  every day from the manioc grown in the villages around, and every able  bodied native has to contribute his or her quota of work. Each person  indeed is supposed to work for at least forty hours each month, and  whether engaged on roads, buildings, or other public work, or in  collecting rubber, wood for the steamers, or kwanga for food, is paid at  the current rate. The principle of the system of Government, although  entirely novel, is undoubtedly sound and suited to the country and the  condition of the native. The whole territory is divided into two great  parts, the lands of the native chiefs and the vacant lands called here  the Domaine Prive. The Government has however, disposed of part of these  to Concessionary Companies in this sense, that the Companies have the  right to exploit all the products of the forest in these areas. Other  portions have been leased to Missions, to Commercial Houses and to  private people. The Government collects the rubber, ivory, food stuffs,  and other produce from the Domain Lands and with the proceeds,  constructs roads, navigates the rivers, maintains the Government and  army and generally develops the country and civilises the natives.    Trading relations are formed with the chiefs as follows: Agents are sent  into their districts with brass wire, cloth, salt, beads, or other  things likely to attract the natives, and these are exchanged for  rubber, ivory, gum copal, manioc, fish, fowl or other produce; thus the  value of rubber, ivory or any other substance is determined in terms of  brass wire, cloth or salt and so its value in sterling. Similarly, the  value of native labour is discovered and the native paid accordingly.  The brass wire is cut into lengths called mitakos, this form of currency  having been introduced by the late Sir H.M. Stanley. The length of the  mitako, and so its value, varies in different parts of the country. At  present there seems to be no limit to the amount of wire cut into  mitakos, but as the natives use great quantities to make brass rings for  the arms and legs of both sexes, it is difficult to say to what extent  the currency is being debased. The pay of skilled labour here is high,  and unskilled workers receive about as much as similar labourers in  India. The natives pay no taxes in money or its equivalent, but instead  are compelled to do this 40 hours' work per month for the State.    In the afternoon we cross the neck of Stanley Pool and visit  Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo. The town is situated close  to the beach, but the Government offices are high up on a hill above.  Having found the Secretariat, we explain that we are British travellers  and desire to pay our respects to the Governor. The Secretary telephones  as we wait in the office and presumably the Governor asks whether we  have introductions and what we want, for the answer goes back _Non, ils  sont venus, Pop!!!_ However, the Governor, Mr. Gentil, who has spent  many years in the Congo, receives us very kindly, offers to help us with  steamers on the river, gives us some letters of introduction to French  officials on the Ubangi and permits to shoot game. Every where indeed  one meets with kindness, help and consideration from the officials in  Africa, which is in marked contrast to the hide bound system of  formalities which it is necessary to observe and maintain in Europe.    [Illustration: STEAMERS AND DOCKS AT LEOPOLDVILLE.]    A great blowing of the steamer's whistle now takes place, for it is  getting late and it is impossible to navigate the Congo after sunset.  The captain is therefore becoming anxious, but enough light remains to  see the buoys and we reach Leopoldville soon after 6 p.m. We have  arranged to dine at the Mess, an excellent institution wherein all the  Europeans of every rank, except the very highest officials, sit down  together. The Commandant of the Force Publique, the Commandant of the  Port, the Directors of Transports and Posts, and the Doctors, all  take their dinner with the working artisans. Altogether about 130 men  attend the mess, where the cooking and service is excellent while each  has a small bottle of wine and a cup of coffee. By this means, every man  is ensured good wholesome food, and the necessity of restaurants, in  which indiscriminate drinking might take place, is avoided.
