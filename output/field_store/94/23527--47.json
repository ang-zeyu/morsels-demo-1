[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#8)"],[1,"s!--they don't go together at all. Very neat  packages that could never without injury to their pride be designated as  \"bundles\" are different. Such, for instance, might be a square, smoothly  wrapped box of cigars, candy, or books. Also, a gentleman might carry  flowers, or a basket of fruit, or, in fact, any package that looks  tempting. He might even stagger under bags and suitcases, or a small  trunk--but carry a \"bundle\"? Not twice! And yet, many an unknowing woman,  sometimes a very young and pretty one, too, has asked a relative, a  neighbor, or an admirer, to carry something suggestive of a pillow, done  up in crinkled paper and odd lengths of joined string. Then she wonders  afterwards in unenlightened surprise why her cousin, or her neighbor, or  her admirer, who is one of the smartest men in town, never comes to see  her any more!      =A GENTLEMAN OFFERS HIS ARM=    To an old lady or to an invalid a gentleman offers his arm if either of  them wants his support. Otherwise a lady no longer leans upon a gentleman  in the daytime, unless to cross a very crowded thoroughfare, or to be  helped over a rough piece of road, or under other impeding circumstances.  In accompanying a lady anywhere at night, whether down the steps of a  house, or from one building to another, or when walking a distance, a  gentleman always offers his arm. The reason is that in her thin  high-heeled slippers, and when it is too dark to see her foothold clearly,  she is likely to trip.    Under any of these circumstances when he proffers his assistance, he  might say: \"Don't you think you had better take my arm? You might trip.\"  Or--\"Wouldn't it be easier if you took my arm along here? The going is  pretty bad.\" Otherwise the only occasions on which a gentleman offers his  arm to a lady are in taking her in at a formal dinner, or taking her in to  supper at a ball, or when he is an usher at a wedding. Even in walking  across a ballroom, except at a public ball in the grand march, it is the  present fashion for the younger generation to walk side by side, never arm  in arm. This, however, is merely an instance where etiquette and the  custom of the moment differ. Old-fashioned gentlemen still offer their  arm, and it is, and long will be, in accordance with etiquette to do so.  But etiquette does _not_ permit a gentleman to take a lady's arm!    In seeing a lady to her carriage or motor, it is quite correct for a  gentleman to put his hand under her elbow to assist her; and in helping  her out he should alight first and offer her his hand. He should not hold  a parasol over her head unless momentarily while she searches in her  wrist-bag for something, or stops perhaps to put on or take off her glove,  or do anything that occupies both hands. With an umbrella the case is  different, especially in a sudden and driving rain, when she is often very  busily occupied in trying to hold \"good\" clothes out of the wet and a hat  on, as well. She may also, under these circumstances, take the gentleman's  arm, if the \"going\" is thereby made any easier.      =A LADY NEVER \"ON THE LEFT\"=    The owner always sits on the right hand side of the rear seat of a  carriage or a motor, that is driven by a coachman or a chauffeur. If the  vehicle belongs to a lady, she should take her own place always, unless  she relinquishes it to a guest whose rank is above her own, such as that  of the wife of the President or the Governor. If a man is the owner, he  must, on the contrary, give a lady the right hand seat. Whether in a  private carriage, a car or a taxi, a lady must _never_ sit on a  gentleman's left; because according to European etiquette, a lady \"on the  left\" is _not_ a \"lady.\" Although this etiquette is not strictly observed  in America, no gentleman should risk allowing even a single foreigner to  misinterpret a lady's position.      =AWKWARD QUESTIONS OF PAYMENT=    It is becoming much less customary than it used to be for a gentleman to  offer to pay a lady's way. If in taking a ferry or a subway, a young woman  stops to buy magazines, chocolates, or other trifles, a young man  accompanying her usually offers to pay for them. She quite as usually  answers: \"Don't bother, I have it!\" and puts the change on the counter. It  would be awkward for him to protest, and bad taste to press the point. But  usually in small matters such as a subway fare, he pays for two. If he  invites her to go to a ball game, or to a matinee or to tea, he naturally  buys the tickets and any refreshment which they may have.    Very often it happens that a young woman and a young man who are bound for  the same house party, at a few hours' distance from the place where they  both live, take the same train--either by accident or by pre-arrangement.  In this case the young woman should pay for every item of her journey. She  should not let her companion pay for her parlor car seat or for her  luncheon; nor should he, when they arrive at their destination, tip the  porter for carrying her bag.    A gentleman who is by chance sitting next to a lady of his acquaintance on  a train or boat, should never think of offering to pay for her seat or for  anything she may buy from the vendor.      =THE \"ESCORT\"=    Notwithstanding the fact that he is met, all dressed in his best store  clothes, with his \"lady friend\" leaning on his arm, in the pages of  counterfeit society novels and unauthoritative books on etiquette, there  is no such actual person known to good society--at least not in New York  or any great city--as an escort, he is not only unknown, but he is  impossible.    In good society ladies do not go about under the \"care of\" gentlemen! It  is unheard of for a gentleman to \"take\" a young girl alone to a dance or  to dine or to parties of any description; nor can she accept his  sponsorship anywhere whatsoever. A well behaved young girl goes to public  dances only when properly chaperoned and to a private dance with her  mother or else accompanied by her maid, who waits for her the entire  evening in the dressing room. It is not only improper, it is impossible  for any man to take a lady to a party of any sort, to which she has not  been personally invited by the hostess.    A lady may never be under the \"protection\" of a man _anywhere_! A young  girl is not even taken about by her betrothed. His friends send  invitations to her on his account, it is true, and, if possible, he  accompanies her, but correct invitations must be sent by them to her, or  she should not go.    Older ladies are often thoughtless and say to a young man: \"Bring your  fiancee to see me!\" His answer should be: \"Indeed, I'd love to any time  you telephone her\"; or, \"I know she'd love to come if you'd ask her.\" If  the lady stupidly persists in casually saying, \"Do bring her,\" he must  smile and say lightly: \"But I can't bring her without an invitation from  you.\" Or, he merely evades the issue, and does not bring her.      =THE RESTAURANT CHECK=    Everyone has at some time or other been subjected to the awkward moment  when the waiter presents the check to the host. For a host to count up the  items is suggestive of parsimony, while not to look at them is  disconcertingly reckless, and to pay before their faces for what his  guests have eaten is embarrassing. Having the check presented to a hostess  when gentlemen are among her guests, is more unpleasant. Therefore, to  avoid this whole transaction, people who have not charge accounts, should  order the meal ahead, and at the same time pay for it in advance,  including the waiter's tip. Charge customers should make arrangements to  have the check presented to them elsewhere than at table.      =IN STORES OR SHOPS=    Lack of consideration for those who in any capacity serve you, is always  an evidence of ill-breeding, as well as of inexcusable selfishness.  Occasionally a so-called \"lady\" who has nothing whatever to do but drive  uptown or down in her comfortable limousine, vents her irritability upon a  saleswoman at a crowded counter in a store, because she does not leave  other customers and wait immediately upon her. Then, perhaps, when the  article she asked for is not to be had, she complains to the floor-walker  about the saleswoman's stupidity! Or having nothing that she can think of  to occupy an empty hour on her hands, she demands that every sort of  material be dragged down from the shelves until, discovering that it is at  last time for her appointment, she yawns and leaves.    Of course, on the other hand, there is the genuinely lethargic saleswoman  whose mind doesn't seem to register a single syllable that you have said  to her; who, with complete indifference to you and your preferences,  insists on showing what you distinctly say you do not want, and who caps  the climax by drawling \"They\" are wearing it this season! Does that sort  of saleswoman ever succeed in selling anything? Does anyone living buy  anything because someone, who knows nothing, tells another, who is often  an expert, what an indiscriminating \"They\" may be doing? That kind of a  saleswoman would try to tell Kreisler that \"They\" are not using violins  this season!    There are always two sides to the case, of course, and it is a credit to  good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops  of the first class. Salesmen and women are usually persons who are both  patient and polite, and their customers are most often ladies in fact as  well as \"by courtesy.\" Between those before and those behind the counters,  there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill  and friendliness. It is, in fact, only the woman who is afraid that  someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity, who shows  neither courtesy nor consideration to any except those whom she considers  it to her advantage to please.      =REGARD FOR OTHERS=    Consideration for the rights and feelings of others is not merely a rule  for behavior"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#8)"],[1,"our best. In what way, we prefer  not to say.\"    \"Perhaps there is no need,\" Hamar replied, eyeing the mantelshelf  which bore ample testimony to a full larder, and glancing at Curtis's  feet which were encased in a pair of new and very shiny boots. (A  handsome overcoat that was hanging on the door also attracted his  attention; but that he had seen before, and concluded that it had been  there on the occasion of his last visit.) \"But you had better dry up  now, Ed,\" he continued somewhat caustically, \"or there'll be no chance  of forming the Sorcery Society; it will be dissolved before it's  started. There's no need to ask if you've tried to carry out  instructions as to thoughts, I see it--in your faces. I could never  have believed one experimental week in badness would have made such a  difference to your looks.\"    \"You told us to try hard!\" Kelson murmured, \"and naturally we did. I  reckon you've done the same by your expression. I should hardly have  known you.\"    \"It shows pretty clearly,\" Curtis said, \"what a lot of bad is latent  in most people; and that the right circumstances only are needed to  bring it out. Starvation, for instance, is calculated to bring out the  evil in any one--no matter whom. But what puzzles me, is how we have  escaped being caught!\"    \"That's a good sign,\" Hamar said. \"It bears out what is written in the  book. If you give your whole mind to doing wrong during this trial  week you'll meet with no mishap. But you must be heart and soul in it.  Hunger made us--hunger has been our friend.\"    \"What do you mean?\" Curtis said.    \"Why,\" Hamar replied, \"if we hadn't been well-nigh starving we  shouldn't have been able to carry out the instructions quite so  thoroughly.\"    \"Have you, too, stolen?\" Curtis queried.    \"I have certainly appropriated a few necessaries,\" Hamar said shortly,  \"but I mean to stop now. We have higher game to fly at. Now, with  regard to the tests. I have not been idle I can assure you. I have  secured all the requisites. The mirror and black cat I--well, er--to  use a conventionalism that comes in rather handy--the mirror and  cat--I picked up. The skull I borrowed from a medical I know--the  moth--er--from some one's private collection--and the elderberries,  hemlock and chemicals I obtained from a drug store man in Battery  Street with whom I used to deal. The moon will be full to-night so  that we may as well begin. Will you come round to my room at  eleven-thirty?\"    They promised; and Hamar, as he took his departure, again glanced at  the handsome fur coat hanging on the door.    He was hardly out of hearing when Curtis looked across at Kelson. \"Do  you think he recognised it!\" he whispered. \"You may bet he did, and he  had only just stolen it himself! However, it's his own fault. He told  us to lie and steal, and we've done his bidding.\"    \"We have indeed!\" Kelson sighed; \"at least you have. For my part I'd  rather be content with food!\"    \"Well, I needed clothes just as much as food!\" Curtis snarled. \"If I  went about naked I should only be sent to prison--that's the law. It  punishes you for taking clothes, and it punishes you for going without  them. There's logic for you!\"    Curtis and Kelson spent the rest of the day indoors; and at night  sallied forth to Hamar's.    The solitary attic--if one could thus designate a space of about three  square feet--which comprised Hamar's lodging--had the advantage of  being situated in the top storey of a skyscraper--at least a  skyscraper for that part of the city. From its window could be seen,  high above the serried ranks of chimney-pots on the opposite side of  the street, those two newly erected buildings: William Carman's chewing  gum factory in Hearnes Street, and Mark Goddard's eight-storied  private residence in Van Ness Avenue; and, as if this were not enough  architectural grace for the eye to dwell on, glimmering away to the  right was the needle-like spire of Moss Bates's devil-dodging  establishment in Branman Street; whilst, just behind it, in saucy  mocking impudence, peeped out the gilded roof of the Knee Brothers'  recently erected Cinematograph Palace.    All this and more--much more--was to be seen from Hamar's outlook, and  all for the sum of one dollar and a half per week. When Curtis and  Kelson entered, the room was aglow with moonlight, and Hamar and the  black cat were stealthily regarding one another from opposite corners  of the room. From far away--from somewhere in the very base of the  building, came the dull echo of a shout, succeeded by the violent  slamming of a door; whilst from outside, from one of the many deserted  thoroughfares below, rose the frightened cry of a fugitive woman.  Otherwise all was comparatively still.    \"You're a bit early!\" was Hamar's greeting, \"but better that than  late. Everything is ready, and all we've got to do is to wait till  twelve. Sit down.\"    They did as they were bid. Presently the cat, forsaking its sanctuary,  and ignoring Curtis's solicitations, glided across the floor, and  climbing on to Kelson's knee, refused to budge. The trio sat in  silence till a few minutes before midnight, when Hamar rose, and,  selecting a spot where the moonbeams lay thickest, placed thereon the  tub of water, in which--with its face uppermost--he proceeded to float  a small mirror, set in a cheap wooden frame. He then calmly produced a  pocket knife.    \"What's that for?\" Kelson inquired nervously.    \"Blood!\" Hamar responded. \"One of us must spare three drops. The  conditions demand it--and after all the ham and sausages you two have  eaten I think one of you can spare it best. Which of you shall it be?  Come, there's no time to lose!\"    \"Matt has more blood than I have!\" Curtis growled; \"but why not the  cat?\"    \"It would spoil our chances with it for the other experiment,\" Hamar  said. \"It's a sulky, cross-grained brute, and would give us no end of  trouble. Besides it can bite. Look here, let's draw lots!\"    Curtis and Kelson were inclined to demur; but the proposed method was  so in accordance with custom that there really did not seem any  feasible objection to raise to it. Accordingly lots were drawn--and  Hamar himself was the victim. Curtis laughed coarsely, and Kelson hid  his smiles in the cat's coat. A neighbouring clock now began to strike  twelve.    \"Look alive, Leon!\" Curtis cried, nudging Kelson's elbow. \"Look alive  or it will be too late. The Unknown is mighty particular to a few  seconds. Let me operate on you. I've always fancied I was born to use  the knife--that I've really missed my vocation. You needn't be  afraid--there's no artery in the palm of your hand--you won't bleed to  death.\"    Thus goaded, Hamar pricked away nervously at his hand, and, after  sundry efforts, at last succeeded in drawing blood; three drops of  which he very carefully let fall in the tub.    \"I wish it was light so that we could see it,\" Curtis whispered in  Kelson's ear. \"I believe Jews have different coloured blood to other  people.\"    Though Kelson was apprehensive, Hamar did not appear to have heard;  his whole attention was riveted on the mirror, on the face of which  was a reflection of the moon.    \"I knew nothing would happen,\" Curtis cried, \"you had better wipe your  knife or you'll be arrested for severing some one's jugular. Hulloa!  what's up with the cat?\"    Hamar was about to tell him to be quiet when Kelson caught his arm.  \"Look, Leon! Look! What's the brute doing? Is it mad?\" Kelson gasped.    Hamar turned his head--and there crouching on the floor, in the  moonlight, was the cat, its hair bristling on end and its green eyes  ablaze with an expression which held all three men speechless. When  they were at last able to avert their eyes a fresh surprise awaited  them; the reflection of the moon in the mirror was red--not an  ordinary red--not merely a colour--but red with a lurid luminosity  that vibrated with life--with a life that all three men at once  recognized as emanating from nothing physical--from nothing good.    It vanished suddenly, quite as suddenly as it had come; and the  reflection of the moon was once again only a reflection--a white,  placid sphere.    For some seconds no one spoke. Hamar was the first to break the  silence. \"Well!\" he exclaimed, drawing a long breath; \"what do you  think of that!\"    \"Are you sure you weren't faking?\" Curtis said.    \"I swear I wasn't,\" Hamar replied; \"besides could any one produce a  thing like THAT? The cat didn't think it was a fake--it knew what it  was right enough. Besides, why are your teeth chattering?\"    \"Why are yours?\" Curtis retorted; \"why are Matt's?\"    \"Shall we try the second?\" Hamar asked.    \"No!\" Kelson and Curtis said in chorus. \"No! We've had enough for one  night. We'll be off!\"    \"I think I'll come with you,\" Hamar said, \"after what has happened I  don't quite relish sleeping here alone--or rather with that cat.  Hi--Satan, where are you?\"    Satan was not visible. It had probably hidden under the bed, but as no  one cared to look, its whereabouts remained undiscovered.    With the coming of the sun, the terrors of the night wore off, and the  trio separated. Hamar would on no account accept his friends'  invitation to breakfast on the sausages and ham they had run such  risks in procuring; he made hasty tracks for a snug restaurant in  Bolter's Street, where he had a sumptuous repast for a dollar; and  then slunk home.    Shortly before midnight all three met again, and at once commenced  preparations for the second test. The question arose as to who should  hold Satan. They all had vivid recollections of the cat's behaviour  the previous night; consequently no one was anxious to officiate.  Finally they drew lots, and fate settled on Curtis. An exciting chase  now began. Satan, demonstrating his resentment of their treatment of  him, at every turn, knocked over a water bottle, ripped the skin of  Kelson's knuckles, and made his teeth meet "]]]
