[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#8)"],[1," not one but a thousand fairies took their flight. From the enchanted  visions of his imagination, the painter has drawn an ideal world, and,  superior to his own time, he has created one of those Shakespearian  realms, one of those countries of love and light, one of those paradises  of gallantry that Polyphile built upon the cloud of dreams for the  delicate joy of poetic mortals.    Watteau revived grace. Grace with Watteau is not the antique grace--a  rigid and solid charm, the perfection of the marble of a Galatea, the  entirely plastic and the material glory of a Venus. Grace with Watteau  is grace. It is that nothing that invests a woman with an attraction, a  coquetry, a more than physical beauty. It is that subtile quality which  seems the smile of a line, the soul of form, the spiritual physiognomy  of matter.    [Illustration: L'EMBARQUEMENT POUR L'ILE DE CYTHERE.          _Watteau._]    All the fascinations of a woman in repose: languor, idleness, abandon,  leaning back, reclining at full length, nonchalance, the cadences of  pose, the pretty air of profiles bending over the scales of love  (_gammes d'amour_), the receding curves of the bosom, the serpentine  lines and undulations, the suppleness of the female body, the play of  slender fingers on the handle of a fan and the indiscretions of high  heels beyond the skirts, and the happy fortune of deportment, and the  coquetry of actions, and the management of the shoulders, and all that  knowledge that was taught to women by the mirrors of the last  century,--the mimicry of grace!--lives in Watteau with its blossom and  its accent, immortal and fixed in a more vital proof than the bosom of  the wife of Diomedes moulded by the ashes of Pompeii. And if this grace  is animated by Watteau, if he looses it from repose and immobility, if  he renders it active and moving, it seems that it works with a rhythm  and that its measured pace is a dance led by some harmony.    How decorative is the form of woman, and her grace! O nature, wherein  the painter's poetic fancies wander! O landscape! O stage fit for a  desirable life! a helpful land, gallant woods, meadows full of music,  groves propitious to the sports of Echo! cradling trees hung with  baskets of flowers! desert places far from the jealous world, touched by  the magic brush of a Servandoni, refreshed with fountains, peopled with  marbles and statues, and Naiads, that spot the trembling shadow of the  leaves! jets of water suddenly springing up in the midst of farm-yards!  an amiable and radiant countryside! Suns of apotheosis, beautiful lights  sleeping on the lawns, penetrating and translucent verdure without one  shadow where the palette of Veronese, the riot of purple, and of blonde  tresses may find sleep. Rural delights! murmurous and gorgeous  decorations! gardens thick with brier and rose! French landscapes  planted with Italian pines! villages gay with weddings and carriages,  ceremonies, toilettes, and fetes stunned with the noise of violins and  flutes leading the bridal of Nature and the Opera to a Jesuit fane!  Rustic scene on the green curtain, on the flowery slope up which the  _Comedie Francaise_ climbs and the _Comedie Italienne_ gambols.    Quick! to array the spring in ball costume, Watteau's heavens and earth,  quick. _Gelosi!_ A bergomask laugh shall be the laughter, animation, and  action, and movement of the piece. Look where Folly, capped and belled,  runs and wakes gaiety, zephyrs, and noise! Ruffs and caps, belts and  daggers, little vests and short mantles, go and come. The band of  buffoons comes running, bringing beneath the shady boughs the carnival  of human passions and its rainbow-hued garb. Variegated family, clothed  with sunlight and brilliant silk! that masks with the night! that  patches and paints with the moon! Harlequin, as graceful as a product of  the pencil of Parmesan! Pierrot, with his arms at his side, as straight  as an I, and the Tartaglias, and the Scapins, and the Cassandras, and  the Doctors, and the favourite Mezzetin \"the big brown man with the  laughing face\" always in the foreground with his cap on the back of his  head--striped all over like a zebra, proud as a god, and drunk as a  Silenus! It is the _Comedie Italienne_ that plays the guitar in all  these landscapes....    Here is the new Olympus and the new mythology; the Olympus of all the  demi-gods forgotten by antiquity. Here is the deification of the ideas  of the Eighteenth Century, the soul of Watteau's world and time led to  the Pantheon of human passions and fashions. These are the new humours  of aging humanity--Languor, Gallantry, and Reverie, which Watteau  incarnates as clothed allegories, and which he rests upon the _pulvinar_  of a divine nature; these are the moral muses of our age out of which he  has created the women, or, we might say, the goddesses of these divine  pictures.    Love is the light of this world, it penetrates and fills it. It is the  youth and serenity of it; and amidst rivers and mountains, promenades  and gardens, lakes and fountains, the Paradise of Watteau unfolds; it is  Cythera. Under a sky painted with the colours of summer, the galley of  Cleopatra swings at the bank. The waves are stilled. The woods are  hushed. From the grass to the firmament, beating the motionless air with  their butterfly wings, a host of Cupids fly, fly, play and dance, here  tying careless couples with roses, and tying above a circlet of kisses  that has risen from earth to the sky. Here is the temple, here is the  end of this world: the painter's _L'Amour paisible_, Love disarmed,  seated in the shadows, which the poet of Theos wished to engrave upon a  sweet cup of spring; a smiling Arcadia; a Decameron of sentiment; a  tender meditation; attentions with vague glances; words that lull the  soul; a platonic gallantry, a leisure occupied by the heart, an idleness  of youthful company; a court of amorous thoughts; the emotional and  playful courtesy of the young newly married leaning upon the offered  arm; eyes without fever, desire without appetite, voluptuousness without  desire, audacious gestures regulated like the ballet for a spectacle,  and tranquil defences disdainful of haste through their security; the  romance of the body and the mind, soothed, pacified, resuscitated,  happy; an idleness of passion at which the stone satyrs lurking in the  green _coulisses_ laugh with their goat-laughter. Adieu to the  bacchanales led by Gillot, that last pagan of the Renaissance, born of  the libations of the Pleiad to the rustic gods of Arcueil! Adieu to the  Olympus of the _Io Paean_, the hoarse pipe and the goat-footed Gods, the  laughter of the _Cyclops_ of Euripides and the _Evohe_ of Ronsard, the  licentious triumphs, the ivy-crowned Joys;      \"_Et la libre cadence    De leur danse._\"    These gods have gone, and Rubens, who lives again in that palette of  light and rosy flesh, wanders bewildered in these _fetes_, where the  riot of the senses is stilled,--animated caprices which seem to await  the crack of a whip to dissolve and disappear in the realm of fancy like  a mid-summer night's dream! It is Cythera; but it is Watteau's. It is  love, but it is a poetic love, a love that dreams and thinks; modern  love, with its aspirations and its crown of melancholy.    Yes, at the heart of this work of Watteau's, I do not know what slow and  vague harmony murmurs behind those laughing words; I do not know what  musical and sweetly contagious sorrow is diffused throughout these  gallant _fetes_. Like the fascination of Venice, I do not know what  veiled and sighing poetry in low tones holds here the charmed spirit.  The man has passed across his work; and this work you come to regard as  the play and distraction of a suffering thought, like the playthings of  a sick child who is now dead....    But let us speak of that masterpiece of French masterpieces, that canvas  which has held a distinguished place on one of the walls of the _salon  carre_ for fifty years, _L'Embarquement de Cythere_.    Observe all that ground lightly coated with a transparent and golden  varnish, all that ground covered with rapid strokes of the brush lightly  laid on with a delicate touch. Notice that green of the trees shot  through with red tones, penetrated with quivering air, and the vaporous  light of autumn. Notice the delicate water-colour effect of thick oil,  the general smoothness of the canvas, the relief of this pouch or hood;  notice the full modelling of the little faces with their glances in the  confused outlines of the eye and their smiles in the suggested outlines  of the mouth. The beautiful and flowing sweep of the brush over those  _decolletages_, the bare flesh glowing with voluptuous rose among the  shadows of the wood! The pretty crossings of the brush to round a neck!  The beautiful undulating folds with soft breaks like those which the  modeller makes in the clay! And the spirit and the gallantry of touch of  Watteau's brush in the feminine trifles and headdresses and  finger-tips,--and everything it approaches! And the harmony of those  sunlit distances, those mountains of rosy snow, those waters of  verdurous reflections; and again those rays of sunlight falling upon  robes of rose and yellow, mauve petticoats, blue mantles, shot-coloured  vests, and little white dogs with fiery spots. For no painter has  equalled Watteau in rendering beautifully coloured objects transfigured  by a ray of sunlight, their soft fading and that kind of diffused  blossoming of their brilliancy under the full light. Let your eyes rest  for a moment on that band of pilgrims of both sexes hurrying, beneath  the setting sun, towards the galley of Love that is about to set sail:  there is the joyousness of the most adorable colours in the world  surprised in a ray of the sun, and all that haze and tender silk in the  radiant shower involuntarily remind you of those brilliant insects that  we find dead,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17487"],[0,"Casa Grande Ruin (#8)"],[1,"the Casa Grande group was occupied a long time,  not as a whole, but piecemeal as it were, one part being occupied and  abandoned while some other part was being built up, and that this ebb  and flow of population through many generations reached its final period  in the occupation of the structure here termed the Casa Grande ruin. It  is probable that this structure did not exist at the time the site was  first occupied, and still more probable that all or nearly all the other  sites were abandoned for some time before the structure now called the  Casa Grande was erected. It is also probable that after the abandonment  of the Casa Grande the ground about it was still worked by its former  population, who temporarily occupied, during the horticultural season,  farming outlooks located near it.    [Illustration: Pl. LX: Circular Opening in North Room.]    The methods employed in the construction of the buildings of the Casa  Grande were thoroughly aboriginal and characteristically rude in  application. A fair degree of adaptability to purpose and environment is  seen, indicating that the Casa Grande was one, and not the first,  building of a series constructed by the people who erected it and by  their ancestors, but the degree of skill exhibited and amount of  ingenuity shown in overcoming difficulties do not compare with that  found in many northern ruins. As architects, the inhabitants of the Casa  Grande did not occupy the first rank among pueblo-builders.    It is probable that the Casa Grande ruin as we see it today shows very  nearly the full height of the structure as it stood when it was  abandoned. The middle tier of rooms rose to a height of three stories;  the others were but two stories high. It is also probable that the  building was enlarged after being once completed and occupied. At one  time it probably consisted of four rooms on the ground plan, each two  stories high. The northern tier, of rooms was added afterward, and  probably also the third room in the central tier.    The Casa Grande was undoubtedly built and occupied by a branch of the  Pueblo race, or by an allied people. Who these people were it is  impossible to determine finally from the examination of one ruin, but  all the evidence at hand suggests that they were the ancestors of the  present Pima Indians, now found in the vicinity and known to have  formerly been a pueblo-building tribe. This conclusion is supported by  the Pima traditions, as collected by Mr. Bandelier, who is intimately  acquainted with the documentary history of the southwest, and whose  knowledge of the Pima traditions is perhaps greater than that of anyone  else now living. In his various writings he hints at this connection,  and in one place he declares explicitly that the Casa Grande is a Pima  structure. None of the internal evidence of the ruin is at variance with  this conclusion. On the contrary, the scanty evidence is in accord with  the hypothesis that the Casa Grande was erected and occupied by the  ancestors of the Pima Indians.
