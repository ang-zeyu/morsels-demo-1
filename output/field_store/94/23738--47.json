We return to the question of life. With almost twice as much solar heat  and light as we have, and with a deeper and denser atmosphere than ours,  it is evident, without seeking other causes of variation, that the  conditions of life upon Venus are notably different from those with  which we are acquainted. At first sight it would seem that a dense  atmosphere, together with a more copious supply of heat, might render  the surface temperature of Venus unsuitable for organic life as we  understand it. But so much depends upon the precise composition of the  atmosphere and upon the relative quantities of its constituents, that it  will not do to pronounce a positive judgment in such a case, because we  lack information on too many essential points.    Experiment has shown that the temperature of the air varies with changes  in the amount of carbonic acid and of water vapor that it contains. It  has been suggested that in past geologic ages the earth's atmosphere was  denser and more heavily charged with vapors than it is at present; yet  even then forms of life suited to their environment existed, and from  those forms the present inhabitants of our globe have been developed.  There are several lines of reasoning which may be followed to the  conclusion that Venus, as a life-bearing world, is younger than the  earth, and, according to that view, we are at liberty to imagine our  beautiful sister planet as now passing through some such period in its  history as that at which the earth had arrived in the age of the  carboniferous forests, or the age of the gigantic reptiles who ruled  both land and sea.    But, without making any assumptions as to the phase of evolution which  life may have attained on Venus, it is also possible to think that the  planet's thick shell of air, with its abundant vapors, may serve as a  shield against the excessive solar radiation. Venus is extraordinarily  brilliant, its reflective power being greatly in excess of Mercury's,  and it has often been suggested that this may be due to the fact that a  large share of the sunlight falling upon it is turned back before  reaching the planet's surface, being reflected both from the atmosphere  itself and from vast layers of clouds.    Even when viewed with the most powerful telescopes and in the most  favoring circumstances, the features of Venus's surface are difficult  to see, and generally extremely difficult. They consist of faint shadowy  markings, indefinite in outline, and so close to the limit of visibility  that great uncertainty exists not only as to their shape and their  precise location upon the planet, but even as to their actual existence.  No two observers have represented them exactly alike in drawings of the  planet, and, unfortunately, photography is as yet utterly unable to deal  with them. Mr. Percival Lowell, in his special studies of Venus in 1896,  using a 24-inch telescope of great excellence, in the clear and steady  air of Arizona, found delicate spokelike streaks radiating from a  rounded spot like a hub, and all of which, in his opinion, were genuine  and definite markings on the planet's surface. But others, using larger  telescopes, have failed to perceive the shapes and details depicted by  Mr. Lowell, and some are disposed to ascribe their appearances to  Venus's atmosphere. Mr. Lowell himself noticed that the markings seemed  to have a kind of obscuring veil over them.    In short, all observers of Venus agree in thinking that her atmosphere,  to a greater or less extent, serves as a mask to conceal her real  features, and the possibilities of so extensive an atmosphere with  reference to an adjustment of the peculiar conditions of the planet to  the requirements of life upon it, are almost unlimited. If we could  accurately analyze that atmosphere we would have a basis for more exact  conclusions concerning Venus's habitability.    But the mere existence of the atmosphere is, in itself, a strong  argument for the habitability of the planet, and as to the temperature,  we are really not compelled to imagine special adaptations by means of  which it may be brought into accord with that prevailing upon the earth.  As long as the temperature does not rise to the _destructive_ point,  beyond which our experience teaches that no organic life can exist, it  may very well attain an elevation that would mean extreme discomfort  from our point of view, without precluding the existence of life even in  its terrestrial sense.    And would it not be unreasonable to assume that vital phenomena on other  planets must be subject to exactly the same limitations that we find  circumscribing them in our world? That kind of assumption has more than  once led us far astray even in dealing with terrestrial conditions.    It is not so long ago, for instance, since life in the depths of the sea  was deemed to be demonstrably impossible. The bottom of the ocean, we  were assured, was a region of eternal darkness and of frightful  pressure, wherein no living creatures could exist. Yet the first dip of  the deep-sea trawl brought up animals of marvelous delicacy of  organization, which, although curiously and wonderfully adapted to live  in a compressed liquid, collapsed when lifted into a lighter medium, and  which, despite the assumed perpetual darkness of their profound abode,  were adorned with variegated colors and furnished with organs of  phosphorescence whereby they could create for themselves all the light  they needed.    Even the fixed animals of the sea, growing, like plants, fast to the  rocks, are frequently vivid with living light, and there is a splendid  suggestion of nature's powers of adaptation, which may not be entirely  inapplicable to the problems of life on strange planets, in Alexander  Agassiz's statement that species of sea animals, living below the depths  to which sunlight penetrates, \"may dwell in total darkness and be  illuminated at times merely by the movements of abyssal fishes through  the forests of phosphorescent alcyonarians.\"    In attempting to judge the habitability of a planet such as Venus we  must first, as far as possible, generalize the conditions that govern  life and restrict its boundaries.    On the earth we find animated existence confined to the surface of the  crust of the globe, to the lower and denser strata of the atmosphere,  and to the film of water that constitutes the oceans. It does not exist  in the heart of the rocks forming the body of the planet nor in the void  of space surrounding it outside the atmosphere. As the earth condensed  from the original nebula, and cooled and solidified, a certain quantity  of matter remained at its surface in the form of free gases and unstable  compounds, and, within the narrow precincts where these things were,  lying like a thin shell between the huge inert globe of permanently  combined elements below, and the equally unchanging realm of the ether  above, life, a phenomenon depending upon ceaseless changes, combinations  and recombinations of chemical elements in unstable and temporary union,  made its appearance, and there only we find it at the present time.    It is because air and water furnish the means for the continual  transformations by which the bodies of animals and plants are built up  and afterward disintegrated and dispersed, that we are compelled to  regard their presence as prerequisites to the existence, on any planet,  of life in any of the forms in which we are acquainted with it. But if  we perceive that another world has an atmosphere, and that there is  water vapor in its atmosphere--both of which conditions are fulfilled by  Venus--and if we find that that world is bathed in the same sunshine  that stimulates the living forces of our planet, even though its  quantity or intensity may be different, then it would seem that we are  justified in averring that the burden of proof rests upon those who  would deny the capability of such a world to support inhabitants.    The generally accepted hypothesis of the origin of the solar system  leads us to believe that Venus has experienced the same process of  evolution as that which brought the earth into its present condition,  and we may fairly argue that upon the rocky shell of Venus exists a  region where chemical combinations and recombinations like those on the  surface of the earth are taking place. It is surely not essential that  the life-forming elements should exist in exactly the same states and  proportions as upon the earth; it is enough if some of them are  manifestly present. Even on the earth these things have undergone much  variation in the course of geological history, coincidently with the  development of various species of life. Just at present the earth  appears to have reached a stage where everything contributes to the  maintenance of a very high organization in both the animal and vegetable  kingdoms.    So each planet that has attained the habitable stage may have a typical  adjustment of temperature and atmospheric constitution, rendering life  possible within certain limits peculiar to that planet, and to the  special conditions prevailing there. Admitting, as there is reason for  doing, that different planets may be at different stages of development  in the geological and biological sense, we should, of course, not expect  to find them inhabited by the same living species. And, since there is  also reason to believe that no two planets upon arriving at the same  stage of evolution as globes would possess identical gaseous  surroundings, there would naturally be differences between their organic  life forms notwithstanding the similarity of their common phase of  development in other respects. Thus a departure from the terrestrial  type in the envelope of gases covering a planet, instead of"]]]
