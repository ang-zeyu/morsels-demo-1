Besides this, it had always been the intent of  the Spanish government that further explorations of the interior country  should take place, so that, as the Missions became strong enough to  support themselves, the Indians there might be brought under the  influence of the Church. Governor Neve's regulations say:    \"It is made imperative to increase the number of Reductions (stations  for converting the Indians) in proportion to the vastness of the country  occupied, and although this must be carried out in the succession and  order aforesaid, as fast as the older establishments shall be fully  secure, etc.,\" and earlier, \"while the breadth of the country is unknown  (it) is presumed to be as great as the length, or greater (200 leagues),  since its greatest breadth is counted by thousands of leagues.\"    Various investigations were made by the nearest priests in order to  select the best locations for the proposed Missions, and, in 1796,  Lasuen reported the results to the new governor, Borica, who in turn  communicated them to the Viceroy in Mexico. Approval was given and  orders issued for the establishment of the five new Missions.    On June 9, 1797, Lasuen left San Francisco for the founding of the  Mission San Jose, then called the Alameda. The following day, a brush  church was erected, and, on the morrow, the usual foundation ceremonies  occurred. The natives named the site _Oroysom_. Beautifully situated on  the foothills, with a prominent peak near by, it offers an extensive  view over the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay region. At  first, a wooden structure with a grass roof served as a church; but  later a brick structure was erected, which Von Langsdorff visited  in 1806.    It seems singular to us at this date that although the easiest means of  communication between the Missions of Santa Clara, San Jose and San  Francisco was by water on the Bay of San Francisco, the padre and  soldiers at San Francisco had no boat or vessel of any kind. Langsdorff  says of this: \"Perhaps the missionaries are afraid lest if there were  boats, they might facilitate the escape of the Indians, who never wholly  lose their love of freedom and their attachment to their native habits;  they therefore consider it better to confine their communication with  one another to the means afforded by the land. The Spaniards, as well as  their nurslings, the Indians, are very seldom under the necessity of  trusting themselves to the waves, and if such a necessity occur, they  make a kind of boat for the occasion, of straw, reeds, and rushes, bound  together so closely as to be water-tight. In this way they contrive to  go very easily from one shore to the other. Boats of this kind are  called _walza_ by the Spanish. The oars consist of a thin, long pole  somewhat broader at each end, with which the occupants row sometimes on  one side, sometimes on the other.\"    For the next Mission two sites were suggested; but, as early as June 17,  Corporal Ballesteros erected a church, missionary-house, granary, and  guard-house at the point called by the natives _Popeloutchom_, and by  the Spaniards, San Benito. Eight days later, Lasuen, aided by Padres  Catala and Martiarena, founded the Mission dedicated to the saint of  that day, San Juan Bautista.    Next in order, between the two Missions of San Antonio de Padua and San  Luis Obispo, was that of \"the most glorious prince of the heavenly  militia,\" San Miguel. Lasuen, aided by Sitjar, in the presence of a  large number of Indians, performed the ceremony in the usual form, on  July 25, 1797. This Mission eventually grew to large proportions and its  interior remains to-day almost exactly as decorated by the hands of the  original priests.    San Fernando Rey was next established, on September 8, by Lasuen, aided  by Padre Dumetz.    After extended correspondence between Lasuen and Governor Borica, a  site, called by the natives _Tacayme_, was finally chosen for locating  the next Mission, which was to bear the name of San Luis, Rey de  Francia. Thus it became necessary to distinguish between the two saints  of the same name: San Luis, Bishop (Obispo), and San Luis, King; but  modern American parlance has eliminated the comma, and they are  respectively San Luis Obispo and San Luis Rey. Lasuen, with the honored  Padre Peyri and Padre Santiago, conducted the ceremonies on June 13, and  the hearts of all concerned were made glad by the subsequent baptism of  fifty-four children.    It was as an adjunct to this Mission that Padre Peyri, in 1816, founded  the chapel of San Antonio de Pala, twenty miles east from San Luis Rey:  to which place were removed the Palatingwas, or Agua Calientes, evicted  a few years ago from Warner's Ranch. This chapel has the picturesque  _campanile_, or small detached belfry, the pictures of which are known  throughout the world.    With the founding of San Luis Rey this branch of the work of President  Lasuen terminated. Bancroft regards him as a greater man than Serra, and  one whose life and work entitle him to the highest praise. He died at  San Carlos on June 26, 1803, and was buried by the side of Serra.        CHAPTER V    THE FOUNDING OF SANTA INES, SAN RAFAEL AND SAN FRANCISCO SOLANO    Estevan Tapis now became president of the Missions, and under his  direction was founded the nineteenth Mission, that of Santa Ines, virgin  and martyr. Tapis himself conducted the ceremonies, preaching a sermon  to a large congregation, including Commandant Carrillo, on September  17, 1804.    With Lasuen, the Mission work of California reached its maximum power.  Under his immediate successors it began to decline. Doubtless the fact  that the original chain was completed was an influence in the decrease  of activity. For thirteen years there was no extension. A few minor  attempts were made to explore the interior country, and many of the  names now used for rivers and locations in the San Joaquin Valley were  given at this time. Nothing further, however, was done, until in 1817,  when such a wide-spread mortality affected the Indians at the San  Francisco Mission, that Governor Sola suggested that the afflicted  neophytes be removed to a new and healthful location on the north shore  of the San Francisco Bay. A few were taken to what is now San Rafael,  and while some recovered, many died. These latter, not having received  the last rites of religion, were subjects of great solicitude on the  part of some of the priests, and, at last, Father Taboada, who had  formerly been the priest at La Purisima Concepcion, consented to take  charge of this branch Mission. The native name of the site was  _Nanaguani_. On December 14, Padre Sarria, assisted by several other  priests, conducted the ceremony of dedication to San Rafael Arcangel. It  was originally intended to be an _asistencia_ of San Francisco, but  although there is no record that it was ever formally raised to the  dignity of an independent Mission, it is called and enumerated as such  from the year 1823 in all the reports of the Fathers. To-day, not a  brick of its walls remains; the only evidence of its existence being the  few old pear trees planted early in its history.    There are those who contend that San Rafael was founded as a direct  check to the southward aggressions of the Russians, who in 1812 had  established Fort Ross, but sixty-five miles north of San Francisco.  There seems, however, to be no recorded authority for this belief,  although it may easily be understood how anxious this close proximity of  the Russians made the Spanish authorities.    They had further causes of anxiety. The complications between Mexico and  Spain, which culminated in the independence of the former, and then the  establishment of the Empire, gave the leaders enough to occupy  their minds.    The final establishment took place in 1823, without any idea of founding  a new Mission. The change to San Rafael had been so beneficial to the  sick Indians that Canon Fernandez, Prefect Payeras, and Governor  Argueello decided to transfer bodily the Mission of San Francisco from  the peninsula to the mainland north of the bay, and make San Rafael  dependent upon it. An exploring expedition was sent out which somewhat  carefully examined the whole neighborhood and finally reported in favor  of the Sonoma Valley. The report being accepted, on July 4, 1823, a  cross was set up and blessed on the site, which was named New San  Francisco.    Padre Altimira, one of the explorers, now wrote to the new padre  presidente--Senan--explaining what he had done, and his reasons for so  doing; stating that San Francisco could no longer exist, and that San  Rafael was unable to subsist alone. Discussion followed, and Sarria, the  successor of Senan, who had died, refused to authorize the change;  expressing himself astonished at the audacity of those who had dared to  take so important a step without consulting the supreme government. Then  Altimira, infuriated, wrote to the governor, who had been a party to the  proposed removal, concluding his tirade by saying:    \"I came to convert gentiles and to establish new Missions, and if I  cannot do it here, which, as we all agree, is the best spot in  California for the purpose, I will leave the country.\"    Governor Argueello assisted his priestly friend as far as he was able,  and apprised Sarria that he would sustain the new establishment;  although he would withdraw the order for the suppression of San Rafael.  A compromise was then effected by which New San Francisco was to remain  a Mission in regular standing, but neither San Rafael nor old San  Francisco were to be disturbed.    Is it not an inspiring subject for speculation? Where would the modern  city of San Francisco be, if the irate Father and plotting politicians  of those early days had been successful in their schemes?    The new Mission, all controversy being settled, was formally dedicated  on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#8)"],[1,"him and support his cause.    [Sidenote: Cartel]    Out of these enlightened views of war has sprung the System of Cartels  for the exchange of prisoners. These exchanges are generally regulated  by special convention between the hostile states. Prisoners are  sometimes permitted to return home, upon condition not to serve again  during the war, or until duly exchanged. Officers are frequently  released upon their parole, on the same condition; and to carry more  effectually into operation the arrangements necessary for these  purposes, commissaries are permitted to reside in the respective  hostile states.    Subject to the principle of non-resistance, there are several classes  of persons that are generally considered exempt from the operations of  war, beyond the effects of unavoidable accident. \"All the members of  the enemy's state,\" says Wheaton,         \"may lawfully be treated as enemies, in a Public War; but it       does not follow that all are to be treated alike; though we       may lawfully destroy some of them, it does not follow that       we may lawfully destroy all; for the general rule derived       from the natural law is still the same, that no force       against an enemy is lawful, unless it is necessary to       accomplish the purposes of war. The custom of civilised       nations founded on this principle, has therefore exempted       the persons of the Sovran and his family, the members of the       Civil Government, women and children, cultivators of the       earth, artizans, labourers, merchants, men of science and       letters, and generally all other public or private persons       engaged in the ordinary civil pursuits of life, from the       direct effect of military operations, unless actually taken       in arms, or guilty of some misconduct in violation of the       usages of war, by which they forfeit their immunity.\"[81]    The same principle of moderation towards that which is non-resisting  limits and restrains the operations of war against the territory and  other property of the enemy. There is a marked difference in the  rights of war carried on by land and at sea, in modification of the  general right to seize on _all_ the enemy's property, and to  appropriate that property to the captors.    [Sidenote: Objects of a Maritime War.]    The object of a Maritime War is the destruction of the enemy's  commerce and navigation, in order to weaken and destroy the  foundations of his naval power. The capture or destruction of  _private_ property is necessary to that end, and is allowed in  maritime wars, by the practice and law of nations.    [Sidenote: Private Property on Land.]    But _private property on land_ is exempt from confiscation, with the  exception of such as may become booty in special cases, when taken  from enemies in the field or in besieged towns, and of military  contributions levied upon the inhabitants of the hostile territory.  This exemption extends even to an absolute and unqualified conquest of  an enemy's country. In ancient times, both real and personal property  of the vanquished passed to the victors; but the last example of  confiscation and partition among the conquerors in Europe, was that of  England, by William of Normandy.    Unless in special cases, private property on land is not touched,  without making compensation; though contributions are sometimes levied  in lieu of a necessary confiscation, or for the expenses of  maintaining and affording protection. In other respects private rights  are unaffected by war.    [Sidenote: Government Property.]    The property, however, belonging to the Government of the vanquished  nation, passes to the victorious state, which also takes the place of  the former Sovereign, in respect to the eminent domain.[82]    [Sidenote: Limitations of the Right of making War.]    The right of making War, as we have shown in the first chapter of this  book, solely belongs to the Sovran power. Subjects cannot, therefore,  of themselves, take any step in the affair; nor are they allowed to  commit any act of hostility without orders from their Sovran.    The Sovran's order which commands acts of hostility, is either general  or particular. The declaration of war, which enjoins the subjects to  attack the enemy's subjects, implies a general order. Generals,  officers, soldiers, privateersmen, and partisans, being all.  commissioned by the Sovran, make war by virtue of a particular order.    In declarations of war, the ancient form is still retained,[83] by  which subjects in general are ordered, not only to break off all  intercourse with, but also to _attack_ the foe. Custom interprets this  general order. It authorises, indeed, and even obliges every subject,  of whatever rank, to secure the persons and things belonging to the  enemy, when they fall into his hands; but it does not invite the  subject to undertake any offensive expedition without a commission or  particular order.[84]        SECTION II.        _Prizes and Privateers_.    [Sidenote: Privateer Commissions.]    During the lawless confusion of the feudal ages, the right of making  Reprisals was claimed and exercised, with out a Public Commission. It  was not until the fifteenth century that Commissions were held  necessary, and were issued to private subjects in time of war, and  that subjects were forbidden to fit out vessels to cruise against  enemies without licence. There were ordinances in Germany, France,  Spain, and England, to that effect.[85]    [Sidenote: Non-Commissioned Captors.]    Hostilities, without a Commission, are contrary to usage, and  exceedingly irregular and dangerous, but they are not considered as  acts of Piracy during the time of war. Noncommissioned vessels of a  belligerent nation may at all times capture hostile ships, without  being deemed, by the Law of Nations, Pirates. But they have no  interest in the prizes they take, and the property so seized is  condemned to the Government as _Droits of the Admiralty_. The reward  of this class of captors is left to the liberality of the Admiralty,  and is often referred to the Admiralty Court.    [Sidenote: Right of Capture.]    The fruits of any forcible detention or occupancy, prior to  hostilities, are vested in the crown; similarly, _British_ property  taken in course of trade forbidden by the laws of his country, is  condemned to the Crown, and not to the individual captor.[86]    To prevent the custom house or excise vessels, that may be  commissioned with letters of marque, turning their attention from the  smugglers to the more attractive adventure of privateering, all  interest in their prizes is reserved to the crown,[87]    [Sidenote: Grants to the Admiralty.]    Though all rights of prize belong originally to the Crown, yet it has  been thought expedient to grant a portion of those rights to maintain  the dignity of the Lord High Admiral. This grant, (whatever it  conveys,) carries with it a total and perpetual alienation of the  rights of the crown, and nothing short of an Act of Parliament can  restore them; whereas the grant to private captors is nothing more  than the mere temporary transfer of a beneficial interest. The rights  of the Admiral, as distinguished from those of the Crown, are these;  that when vessels come in, not under any motive arising out of the  occasions of war, but from distress of weather, or want of provisions,  or from ignorance of war, and are seized in port, they belong to the  Lord High Admiral; but where the hand of violence has been exercised  upon them, where the impression arises from acts connected with war,  from revolt of their own crews, or from being forced or driven in by  the Queen's ships, they belong to the Crown.    This includes ships and goods already come into the ports, creeks, or  roadsteads, of all the Queen's dominions.[88]    [Sidenote: Acquisition of Captures.]    Persons fitting out Private Vessels under a Commission to cruise  against the enemy, acquire the property of whatever Captures they may  make, as a compensation for their disbursements, and for the risks  they run; but they acquire it by grant from the Sovran who issues out  the commission to them. The Sovran allows them either the whole, or a  part of the capture; this entirely depends on the nature of the  contract he has made with them.[89]    This grant of prize is, in terms, a grant of the property of the  Queen's enemies, but it is not restricted to the property of the  nations with whom we are at war. It is held in construction and  practice to embrace all property liable to be condemned as prize, and  which is not particularly reserved to the Crown, or the Admiralty.[90]    It depends, also, on the municipal regulations of each particular  power: and as a necessary precaution against abuse, the owners of  Privateers are required by the ordinances of commercial states to give  adequate security that they will conduct the cruize according to the  laws and usages of war, and the instructions of the Government; and  that they will respect the rights of neutrals, and bring their prizes  in for adjudication.    [Sidenote: Commissions of Privateers.]    The Commissions of Privateers do not extend to the capture of private  property upon land; that is a right which is not even granted to  Queen's ships. The words of the 3rd Section of the Prize Act extend  only to capture by any of Her Majesty's ships,         \"of any fortress upon the land, or any arms, ammunition,       stores of war, goods, merchandize, and treasure, belonging       to the state, or to any public trading company, of the       enemies of the crown of Great Britain, upon the land.\"    Thus the interests of the Queen's cruizers are expressly limited with  respect to the property in which the captors can acquire any interest  of their own, the state still reserving to itself all private  property, in order that no temptation may be held out for unauthorized  expeditions against the"]]]
