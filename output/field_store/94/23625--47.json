At 8 o'clock, both  parties accompanied by their respective guides and making a very  formidable array, set out from the hotel, happy in the anticipation of  the \"sights to be seen.\" It was amusing to hear the remarks, and to  witness the horror of some of the party on first beholding the mouth  of the Cave. Oh! it is so frightful!--It is so cold!--I _cannot_ go  in! Notwithstanding all this, curiosity prevailed, and down we  went--arranged our lamps, which being extinguished in passing through  the doorway by the strong current of air rushing outwards, there arose  such a clamor, such laughter, such screaming, such crying out for the  guides, as though all Bedlam had broke loose,--the guides exerting  themselves to quiet apprehensions, and the visiters of yesterday  knowing that there was neither danger nor just cause of alarm, doing  their utmost to counteract their efforts, by well feigned exclamations  of terror. At length the lamps were re-lighted and order being  restored, onward we went. The Vestibule and Church were each in turn  illuminated, to the enthusiastic delight of all--even those of the  party, who were but now so terrified, were loud in their expressions  of admiration and wonder. Arrived at the Giant's Coffin, we leave the  Main Cave to enter regions very dissimilar to those we have seen. A  narrow passage behind the Coffin leads to a circular room, one hundred  feet in diameter, with a low roof, called the Wooden Bowl, in allusion  to its figure, or as some say, from a wooden bowl having been found  here by some old miner. This Bowl is the vestibule of the Deserted  Chambers. On the right, are the Steeps of Time, (why so called we are  left to conjecture,) down which, descending about twenty feet, and  almost perpendicularly for the first ten, we enter the Deserted  Chambers, which in their course present features extremely wild,  terrific and multiform. For two hundred yards the ceiling as you  advance is rough and broken, but further on, it is waving, white and  smooth as if worn by water. At Richardson's Spring, the imprint of  moccasins and of children's feet, of some by-gone age, were recently  seen. There are more pits in the Deserted Chambers than in any other  portion of the Cave; and among the most noted are the Covered Pit, the  Side-Saddle Pit and the Bottomless Pit. Indeed the whole range of  these chambers, is so interrupted by pits, and throughout is so  irregular and serpentine and so bewildering from the number of its  branches, that the visiter, doubtful of his footing, and uncertain as  to his course, is soon made sensible of the prudence of the  regulation, which enjoins him, \"not to leave the guide.\" \"The Covered  Pit is in a little branch to the left; this pit is twelve or fifteen  feet in diameter, covered with a thin rock, around which a narrow  crevice extends, leaving only a small support on one side. There is a  large rock resting on the centre of the cover. The sound of a  waterfall may be heard from the pit but cannot be seen.\" The  Side-Saddle Pit is about twenty feet long and eight feet wide, with a  margin about three feet high, and extending lengthwise ten feet,  against which one may safely lean, and view the interior of the pit  and dome. After a short walk from this place, we came to a ladder on  our right, which conducted us down about fifteen feet into a narrow  pass, not more than five feet wide; this pass is the Labyrinth, one  end of which leads to the Bottomless Pit, entering it about fifty feet  down, and the other after various windings, now up, now down, over a  bridge, and up and down ladders, conducts you to one of the chief  glories of the Cave,--Gorin's Dome; which, strange to tell, was not  discovered until a few years ago. Immediately behind the ladder, there  is a narrow opening in the rock, extending up very nearly to the cave  above, which leads about twenty feet back to Louisa's Dome, a pretty  little place of not more than twelve feet in diameter, but of twice  that height. This dome is directly under the centre of the cave we had  just been traversing, and when lighted up, persons within it can be  plainly seen from above, through a crevice in the rock. Arrived at  Gorin's Dome, we were forcibly struck by the seeming appearance of  _design_, in the arrangement of the several parts, for the special  accommodation of visiters--even with reference to their number. The  Labyrinth, which we followed up, brought us at its termination, to a  window or hole, about four feet square, three feet above the floor,  opening into the interior of the dome, about midway between the bottom  and top; the wall of rock being at this spot, not more than eighteen  inches thick; and continuing around, and on the outside of the dome,  along a gallery of a few feet in width, for twenty or more paces, we  arrived at another opening of much larger size, eligibly disposed, and  commanding, like the first, a view of very nearly the whole interior  space. Whilst we are arranging ourselves, the guide steals away,  passes down, down, one knows not how, and is presently seen by the dim  light of his lamp, fifty feet below, standing near the wall on the  inside of the dome. The dome is of solid rock, with sides apparently  fluted and polished, and perhaps two hundred feet high. Immediately in  front and about thirty feet from the window, a huge rock seems  suspended from above and arranged in folds like a curtain. Here we are  then, the guide fifty feet below us. Some of the party thrusting their  heads and, in their anxiety to see, their bodies through the window  into the vast and gloomy dome of two hundred feet in height. The  window is not large enough to afford a view to all at once, they crowd  one on the top of the other; the more cautious, and those who do not  like to be squeezed, stand back; but still holding fast to the  garments of their friends for fear they might in the ecstasy of their  feelings, leap into the frightful abyss into which they are looking.  Suddenly the guide ignites a _Bengal light_. The vast dome is radiant  with light. Above, as far as the eye can reach, are seen the shining  sides of the fluted walls; below, the yawning gulf is rendered the  more terrific, by the pallid light exposing to view its vast depth,  the whole displaying a scene of sublimity and splendor, such as words  have not power to describe. Returning, we ascended the ladder near  Louisa's Dome, and continued on, having the Labyrinth on our right  side until it terminates in the Bottomless Pit. This pit terminates  also the range of the Deserted Chambers, and was considered the Ultima  Thule of all explorers, until within the last few years, when Mr.  Stephenson of Georgetown, Ky. and the intrepid guide, Stephen,  conceived the idea of reaching the opposite side by throwing a ladder  across the frightful chasm. This they accomplished, and on this  ladder, extending across a chasm of twenty feet wide and near two  hundred deep, did these daring explorers cross to the opposite side,  and thus open the way to all those splendid discoveries, which have  added so much to the value and renown of the Mammoth Cave. The  Bottomless Pit is somewhat in the shape of a horse-shoe, having a  tongue of land twenty seven feet long, running out into the middle of  it. From the end of this point of land, a substantial bridge has been  thrown across to the cave on the opposite side.    [Illustration: BOTTOMLESS PIT.  On Stone by T. Campbell  Bauer & Teschemacher's Lith.]    While standing on the bridge, the guide lets down a lighted paper into  the deep abyss; it descends twisting and turning, lower and lower, and  is soon lost in total darkness, leaving us to conjecture, as to what  may be below. Crossing the bridge to the opposite cave, we find  ourselves in the midst of rocks of the most gigantic size lying along  the edge of the pit and on our left hand. Above the pit is a dome of  great size, but which, from its position, few have seen. Proceeding  along a narrow passage for some distance, we arrived at the point from  which diverge two noted routes--the Winding Way and Pensico Avenue.  Here we called a short halt; then wishing our newly formed  acquintances [Transcriber's note: sic] a safe voyage over the \"deep  waters,\" we parted; they taking the left hand to the Winding Way and  the rivers, and we the right to Pensico Avenue.          CHAPTER VII.    Pensico Avenue--Great Crossings--Pine Apple Bush--Angelica's Grotto--  Winding Way--Fat Friend in Trouble--Relief Hall--Bacon Chamber--  Bandit's Hall.      Pensico Avenue averages about fifty feet in width, with a height of  about thirty feet; and is said to be two miles long. It unites in an  eminent degree the truly beautiful with the sublime, and is highly  interesting throughout its entire extent. For a quarter of a mile from  the entrance, the roof is beautifully arched, about twelve feet high  and sixty wide, and formerly was encrusted with rosettes and other  formations, nearly all of which have been taken away or demolished,  leaving this section of the Cave quite denuded. The walking here is  excellent; a dozen persons might run abreast for a quarter of a mile  to Bunyan's Way, a branch of the avenue, leading on to the river. At  this point the avenue changes its features of beauty and regularity,  for those of wild grandeur and sublimity, which it preserves to the  end. The way, no longer smooth and level, is frequently interrupted  and turned aside by huge rocks, which lie tumbled around, in all  imaginable disorder. The roof now becomes very lofty and imposingly  magnificent; its long, pointed or lancet arches, forcibly reminding  you of the rich and gorgeous ceilings of the old Gothic Cathedrals, at  the same time solemnly impressing you with the conviction that this is  a \"building not made with hands.\" No one, not dead to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#8)"],[1," the walls, as you enter, are lofty, steep, and strong; and  raised batteries would render any hostile approach extremely hazardous to  the assailants.    There is no ship-building at this moment going on: the ribs of about half a  dozen, half rotted, small merchant-craft, being all that is discernible.  But much is projected, and much is hoped from such projects. Dieppe has  questionless many local advantages both by land and by sea; yet it will  require a long course of years to infuse confidence and beget a love of  enterprise. In spite of all the _naval zeal_, it is here exhibited chiefly  as affording means of subsistence from the fisheries. I must not however  conclude my Dieppe journal without telling you that I hunted far and near  for a good bookseller and for some old books--but found nothing worth the  search, except a well-printed early _Rouen Missal_, and _Terence_ by  _Badius Ascensius_. The booksellers are supplied with books chiefly from  Rouen; the local press being too insignificant to mention.      [29] The French Antiquaries have pushed the antiquity of this castle to the      11th century, supposing it to have been built by _William d'Arques_,      Count of Tallon, son of the second marriage of Richard Duke of      Normandy. I make no doubt, that, whenever built, the sea almost washed      its base: for it is known to have occupied the whole of what is called      the _Valley of Arques_, running as far as _Bouteilles_. Its position,      in reference to the art of war, must have been almost impregnable.      Other hypotheses assign its origin to the ninth or tenth century.      Whenever built, its history has been fertile in sieges. In 1144, it      was commanded by a Flemish Monk, who preferred the spear to the      crosier, but who perished by an arrow in the contest. Of its history,      up to the sixteenth century, I am not able to give any details; but in      the wars of Henry IV. with the League, in 1589, it was taken by      surprise by soldiers in the disguise of sailors: who, killing the      centinels, quickly made themselves masters of the place. Henry caused      it afterwards to be dismantled. In the first half of the eighteenth      century it received very severe treatment from pillage, for the      purpose of erecting public and private buildings at Dieppe. At present      (in the language of the author of the _Rouen Itinerary_) \"it is the      abode of silence--save when that silence is interrupted by owls and      other nocturnal birds.\" The view of it in Mr. Cotman's work is very      faithful.    [30] The _Itineraire de Rouen_, 1816, p. 202, says, absurdly, that      this church is of the XIth century. It is perhaps with more truth of      the beginning of the XIVth century. A pleasing view of it is in Mr.      Dawson Turner's elegant Tour in Normandy, 1818, 8vo. 2 vol. It      possessed formerly a bust of Henry IV., which is supposed to have been      placed there after the famous battle of Arques gained by Henry over      the Duke of Mayenne in 1589.

[32] [I am anxious that the above sentence should stand precisely as it      appeared in the first edition of this work; because a circumstance has      arisen from it, which could have been as little in the anticipation,      as it is in the comprehension, of the author. A lady, of high      connections, and of respectable character, conceived the passage in      question to be somewhat indecorous; or revolting to the serious sense      entertained by all Christians, and especially by CHRISTIAN MINISTERS,      of the mode of devoting the Sabbath day. In consequence, being in      possession of a copy of this work, she DIVIDED it into two; not being      willing to sully the splendour of the plates by the supposed impurity      of such a passage:--and the prints were accordingly bound APART. The      passage--as applied to the FRENCH PEOPLE--requires neither comment nor      qualification; and in the same unsophisticated view of religious      duties, the _latter_ part may be as strictly applied to the      ENGLISH.]    [33] The dress of the _sailors_ is the same as it was in the XIVth      century; and so probably is that of the women. The illuminations in      Froissard and Monstrelet clearly give us the Norman cauchoise.          LETTER IV.    ROUEN. APPROACH. BOULEVARDS. POPULATION. STREET SCENERY.      Here I am, my excellent good friend, in the most extraordinary city in the  world. One rubs one's eyes, and fancies one is dreaming, upon being carried  through the streets of this old-fashioned place: or that, by some secret  talismanic touch, we are absolutely mingling with human beings, and objects  of art, at the commencement of the sixteenth century: so very curious, and  out of the common appearance of things, is almost every object connected  with ROUEN. But before I commence my observations upon the _town_, I must  give you a brief sketch of my _journey_ hither. We had bespoke our places  in the cabriolet of the Diligence, which just holds three tolerably  comfortable; provided there be a disposition to accommodate each other.  This cabriolet, as you have been often told, is a sort of a buggy, or  phaeton seat, with a covering of leather in the front of the coach. It is  fortified with a stiff leathern apron, upon the top of which is a piece of  iron, covered with the leather, to fasten firmly by means of a hook on the  perpendicular supporter of the head. There are stiffish leathern curtains  on each side, to be drawn, if necessary, as a protection against the rain,  &c. You lean upon the bar, or top of this leathern apron, which is no very  uncomfortable resting-place. And thus we took leave of Dieppe, on the 4th  day after our arrival there. As we were seated in the cabriolet, we could  hardly refrain from loud laughter at the novelty of our situation, and the  grotesqueness of the conveyance. Our Postilion was a rare specimen of his  species, and a perfectly _unique copy_. He fancied himself, I suppose,  rather getting \"into the vale of years,\" and had contrived to tinge his  cheeks with a plentiful portion of rouge.[34] His platted and powdered hair  was surmounted with a battered black hat, tricked off with faded ribband:  his jacket was dark blue velvet, with the insignia of his order (the royal  arms) upon his left arm. What struck me as not a little singular, was, that  his countenance was no very faint resemblance of that of _Voltaire_, when  he might have been verging towards his sixtieth year. Most assuredly he  resembled him in his elongated chin, and the sarcastic expression of his  mouth. We rolled merrily along--the horses sometimes spreading, and  sometimes closing, according to the size of the streets through which we  were compelled to pass. The reins and harness are of _cord_; which, however  keep together pretty well. The postilion endeavours to break the rapidity  of the descent by conducting the wheels over small piles of gravel or  rubbish, which are laid at the sides of the road, near the ditch; so that,  to those sitting in the cabriolet, and overlooking the whole process, the  effect, with weak nerves, is absolutely terrific. They stop little in  changing horses, and the Diligence is certainly well managed, and in  general no accidents occur.    The road from Dieppe to Rouen is wide, hard, and in excellent condition.  There are few or no hedges, but rows of apple-trees afford a sufficient  line of demarkation. The country is open, and gently undulating; with  scarcely any glimpses of what is called forest-scenery, till you get  towards the conclusion of the first stage. Nothing particularly strikes you  till you approach _Malaunai_, within about half a dozen miles of Rouen, and  of course after the last change of horses. The environs of this beautiful  village repay you for every species of disappointment, if any should have  been experienced. The rising banks of a brisk serpentine trout stream are  studded with white houses, in which are cotton manufactories that appear to  be carried on with spirit and success. Above these houses are hanging  woods; and though the early spring would scarcely have coated the branches  with green in our own country, yet _here_ there was a general freshness of  verdure, intermingled with the ruddy blossom of the apple; altogether  rejoicing the eye and delighting the heart. Occasionally there were  delicious spots, which the taste and wealth of an Englishman would have  embellished to every possible degree of advantage. But wealth, for the  gratification of picturesque taste, is a superfluity that will not quickly  fall to the lot of the French. The Revolution seems to have drained their  purses, as well as daunted their love of enterprise. Along the road-side  there were some few houses of entertainment; and we observed the emptied  cabriolet and stationary voiture, by the side of the gardens, where  Monsieur and Madame, with their families, tripped lightly along the vistas,  and tittered as John Bull saluted them. Moving vehicles, and numerous  riding and walking groups, increased upon us; and every thing announced  that we were approaching a _great and populous city_.    The approach to ROUEN is indeed magnificent. I speak of the immediate  approach; after you reach the top of a considerable rise, and are stopped  by the barriers. You then look down a strait, broad, and strongly paved  road, lined with a double row of trees on each side. As the foliage was not  thickly set, we could discern, through the delicately-clothed branches, the  tapering spire of the CATHEDRAL, and the more picturesque tower of the  ABBAYE ST. OUEN--with hanging gardens, and white houses, to the  left--covering a richly cultivated ridge of hills, which sink as it were  into the _Boulevards_, and which is called the _Faubourg Cauchoise_. To the  right, through the trees, you see the river SEINE (here of no"]]]
