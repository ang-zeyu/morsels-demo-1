Another illustration of the struggle for existence, in which both plants  and animals are implicated, is afforded by the pampas of the southern  part of South America. The absence of trees from these vast plains has  been imputed by Mr. Darwin to the supposed inability of the tropical and  sub-tropical forms of South America to thrive on them, and there being  no other source from which they could obtain a supply; and that  explanation was adopted by such eminent botanists as Mr. Ball and  Professor Asa Gray. This explanation has always seemed to me  unsatisfactory, because there are ample forests both in the temperate  regions of the Andes and on the whole west coast down to Terra del  Fuego; and it is inconsistent with what we know of the rapid variation  and adaptation of species to new conditions. What seems a more  satisfactory explanation has been given by Mr. Edwin Clark, a civil  engineer, who resided nearly two years in the country and paid much  attention to its natural history. He says: \"The peculiar characteristics  of these vast level plains which descend from the Andes to the great  river basin in unbroken monotony, are the absence of rivers or  water-storage, and the periodical occurrence of droughts, or 'siccos,'  in the summer months. These conditions determine the singular character  both of its flora and fauna.    \"The soil is naturally fertile and favourable for the growth of trees,  and they grow luxuriantly wherever they are protected. The eucalyptus is  covering large tracts wherever it is enclosed, and willows, poplars, and  the fig surround every estancia when fenced in.    \"The open plains are covered with droves of horses and cattle, and  overrun by numberless wild rodents, the original tenants of the pampas.  During the long periods of drought, which are so great a scourge to the  country, these animals are starved by thousands, destroying, in their  efforts to live, every vestige of vegetation. In one of these 'siccos,'  at the time of my visit, no less than 50,000 head of oxen and sheep and  horses perished from starvation and thirst, after tearing deep out of  the soil every trace of vegetation, including the wiry roots of the  pampas-grass. Under such circumstances the existence of an unprotected  tree is impossible. The only plants that hold their own, in addition to  the indestructible thistles, grasses, and clover, are a little  herbaceous oxalis, producing viviparous buds of extraordinary vitality,  a few poisonous species, such as the hemlock, and a few tough, thorny  dwarf-acacias and wiry rushes, which even a starving rat refuses.    \"Although the cattle are a modern introduction, the numberless  indigenous rodents must always have effectually prevented the  introduction of any other species of plants; large tracts are still  honeycombed by the ubiquitous biscacho, a gigantic rabbit; and numerous  other rodents still exist, including rats and mice, pampas-hares, and  the great nutria and carpincho (capybara) on the river banks.\"[9]    Mr. Clark further remarks on the desperate struggle for existence which  characterises the bordering fertile zones, where rivers and marshy  plains permit a more luxuriant and varied vegetable and animal life.  After describing how the river sometimes rose 30 feet in eight hours,  doing immense destruction, and the abundance of the larger carnivora and  large reptiles on its banks, he goes on: \"But it was among the flora  that the principle of natural selection was most prominently displayed.  In such a district--overrun with rodents and escaped cattle, subject to  floods that carried away whole islands of botany, and especially to  droughts that dried up the lakes and almost the river itself--no  ordinary plant could live, even on this rich and watered alluvial  debris. The only plants that escaped the cattle were such as were either  poisonous, or thorny, or resinous, or indestructibly tough. Hence we had  only a great development of solanums, talas, acacias, euphorbias, and  laurels. The buttercup is replaced by the little poisonous yellow oxalis  with its viviparous buds; the passion-flowers, asclepiads, bignonias,  convolvuluses, and climbing leguminous plants escape both floods and  cattle by climbing the highest trees and towering overhead in a flood of  bloom. The ground plants are the portulacas, turneras, and cenotheras,  bitter and ephemeral, on the bare rock, and almost independent of any  other moisture than the heavy dews. The pontederias, alismas, and  plantago, with grasses and sedges, derive protection from the deep and  brilliant pools; and though at first sight the 'monte' doubtless  impresses the traveller as a scene of the wildest confusion and ruin,  yet, on closer examination, we found it far more remarkable as a  manifestation of harmony and law, and a striking example of the  marvellous power which plants, like animals, possess, of adapting  themselves to the local peculiarities of their habitat, whether in the  fertile shades of the luxuriant 'monte' or on the arid, parched-up  plains of the treeless pampas.\"    A curious example of the struggle between plants has been communicated  to me by Mr. John Ennis, a resident in New Zealand. The English  water-cress grows so luxuriantly in that country as to completely choke  up the rivers, sometimes leading to disastrous floods, and necessitating  great outlay to keep the stream open. But a natural remedy has now been  found in planting willows on the banks. The roots of these trees  penetrate the bed of the stream in every direction, and the water-cress,  unable to obtain the requisite amount of nourishment, gradually  disappears.    _Increase of Organisms in a Geometrical Ratio_.    The facts which have now been adduced, sufficiently prove that there is  a continual competition, and struggle, and war going on in nature, and  that each species of animal and plant affects many others in complex and  often unexpected ways. We will now proceed to show the fundamental cause  of this struggle, and to prove that it is ever acting over the whole  field of nature, and that no single species of animal or plant can  possibly escape from it. This results from the fact of the rapid  increase, in a geometrical ratio, of all the species of animals and  plants. In the lower orders this increase is especially rapid, a single  flesh-fly (Musca carnaria) producing 20,000 larvae, and these growing so  quickly that they reach their full size in five days; hence the great  Swedish naturalist, Linnaeus, asserted that a dead horse would be  devoured by three of these flies as quickly as by a lion. Each of these  larvae remains in the pupa state about five or six days, so that each  parent fly may be increased ten thousand-fold in a fortnight. Supposing  they went on increasing at this rate during only three months of summer,  there would result one hundred millions of millions of millions for each  fly at the commencement of summer,--a number greater probably than  exists at any one time in the whole world. And this is only one species,  while there are thousands of other species increasing also at an  enormous rate; so that, if they were unchecked, the whole atmosphere  would be dense with flies, and all animal food and much of animal life  would be destroyed by them. To prevent this tremendous increase there  must be incessant war against these insects, by insectivorous birds and  reptiles as well as by other insects, in the larva as well as in the  perfect state, by the action of the elements in the form of rain, hail,  or drought, and by other unknown causes; yet we see nothing of this  ever-present war, though by its means alone, perhaps, we are saved from  famine and pestilence.    Let us now consider a less extreme and more familiar case. We possess a  considerable number of birds which, like the redbreast, sparrow, the  four common titmice, the thrush, and the blackbird, stay with us all the  year round These lay on an average six eggs, but, as several of them  have two or more broods a year, ten will be below the average of the  year's increase. Such birds as these often live from fifteen to twenty  years in confinement, and we cannot suppose them to live shorter lives  in a state of nature, if unmolested; but to avoid possible exaggeration  we will take only ten years as the average duration of their lives. Now,  if we start with a single pair, and these are allowed to live and breed,  unmolested, till they die at the end of ten years,--as they might do if  turned loose into a good-sized island with ample vegetable and insect  food, but no other competing or destructive birds or quadrupeds--their  numbers would amount to more than twenty millions. But we know very well  that our bird population is no greater, on the average, now than it was  ten years ago. Year by year it may fluctuate a little according as the  winters are more or less severe, or from other causes, but on the whole  there is no increase. What, then, becomes of the enormous surplus  population annually produced? It is evident they must all die or be  killed, somehow; and as the increase is, on the average, about five to  one, it follows that, if the average number of birds of all kinds in our  islands is taken at ten millions--and this is probably far under the  mark--then about fifty millions of birds, including eggs as possible  birds, must annually die or be destroyed. Yet we see nothing, or almost  nothing, of this tremendous slaughter of the innocents going on all  around us. In severe winters a few birds are found dead, and a few  feathers or mangled remains show us where a wood-pigeon or some other  bird has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],[0,"The Teaching of History (#8)"],[1,"for a man to be defeated for the Presidency if a          majority of the people vote for him?    The great disadvantage of this kind of review is that the students have  for their answer a choice between two words, one of which is bound to be  correct. Knowing nothing whatever of the subject, they will still stand  a fifty per cent chance of answering correctly. The alert teacher should  be able to reduce this haphazard answering to a minimum, while still  reaping the advantages of rapidity and thoroughness which the plan  possesses. Few other methods will cover as much ground in as short time.  On the Federal Constitution there are infinite possibilities for \"yes  and no\" questioning, which afford a brief and effective means of review  in the principles of American government.      _They will secure fluency_    Review for the purpose of securing fluency is a consideration frequently  lost sight of by high school history teachers. It may be too sanguine to  expect fluency of the average student reciting on a topic for the first  time. But when it is considered how very many important questions are  never recited on but once, the wisdom of an occasional review to secure  rapid, fluent, and complete answers to topics previously discussed is  readily seen. Select a list of topics that will at one and the same time  cultivate fluency and strengthen the memory for the important  considerations of history. Fluency in itself does not possess sufficient  value to justify the expenditure of recitation time. Facility of  expression needs to be cultivated in discussion of the conclusions  reached in class which need to be clinched in the student's mind. Such  questions as the following will serve as illustrations of the kind  adaptable for such purpose, at the middle of a year course in American  history:--         1. Give three distinct characteristics of French colonization in          America; three of Spanish; three of English.         2. What things did the English colonies possess in common?         3. What were the results to the colonies of the French and Indian          War?         4. To what extent was the Revolution brought about by economic          causes?         5. What were the defects in the Articles of Confederation?         6. Account for the downfall of the Federalist party.         7. In what ways has democracy advanced since 1789?         8. What were the results of the struggle over the admission of          Missouri?         9. Discuss the growth of the sentiment for internal improvements?        10. Describe the social life of the Western pioneer?      _What the student may do with \"problems\" in history_    Still another kind of review of great value in strengthening the  student's ability to generalize and analyze, consists of what might be  called \"problems in history.\" They are given out in much the same way as  original problems in geometry, assuming that the student is acquainted  with the facts from which to deduce the answers to the question. The  object of such a review is to give the student practice in original  thinking. He is not supposed to use a library, but only the facts which  are in his text or which have been previously brought out in class  recitations.    The following are examples of questions adaptable for this purpose:--         1. Why can the American people be regarded as the world's greatest          colonizers?         2. Why could Washington be regarded as only an Englishman living in          America?         3. Is it true that the South lost the Civil War because of slavery?         4. In what particulars did Andrew Jackson accurately reflect the          spirit or the ideals of the new West?         5. What is illustrated by the attempt to found the State of          Franklin?         6. What considerations made the secession of the West in our early          history a likely possibility?    Questions of this kind, not answered directly in class or in the text,  may be given out a day in advance and the answers collected at the next  recitation.          VI    THE USE OF WRITTEN REPORTS      _The purpose of theme work should change as the course continues_    A method frequently employed by teachers of history is to require  written reports or themes on various phases of the history as the work  progresses. This plan is particularly valuable for the students in the  first two years of high school history, for the reason that their  library requirements are less exacting and their need of fluency greater  during that time than later in their course. The objects of theme work  in history courses are usually to arouse the pupil's powers of  observation, description, and narration, and to provide means of drill  in the exercise of these powers. These should not be the sole purposes  of theme work, however. As the year advances, an increasing amount of  the written work should be on subjects requiring some generalization or  analysis of the facts brought out in the text or in the recitation. The  pupil who has written a theme describing the appearance of the Pyramids  has completed an exercise in history less valuable than that of the  student who writes a theme on the errors of the Athenian Democracy.    To summarize, reviews in history should consist of both oral and written  work; they should be rapid enough to insure quick thinking, alert  attention, and small expenditure of time; they should occur with  increasing frequency as the year advances; they should stock the memory,  fix in the student's mind the order of events, stimulate fluency, insure  a permanent acquaintance with the personnel of history, and give to the  student a better view of the subject as a whole and in its various  phases.          VII    EXAMINATIONS AS TESTS OF PROGRESS      _The examination should determine how much the student has progressed_    The time is coming, if it is not already here, when the public will cry out  against the nervous fear and sleepless nights with which their children  approach the semi-annual torture of our inquisitorial examinations. That  reasonable examinations are essential and beneficial is hardly open to  question. That a student should be expected correctly to answer a fair  percentage of reasonable questions on work which has been properly  taught is not a cause of complaint from anyone. But that children should  be frightened into a state of nervous terror by the bugaboo of an  impending examination, and then be forced to attempt a series of  conundrums propounded by a teacher who takes pride in maintaining a high  percentage of failures, is indefensible. An examination should not be  conducted with the primary object of making it a thing to be feared.  However desirable such a questionable asset may seem to certain college  professors, it is a serious fault in a high school teacher to have any  considerable number of normal children fail. The ambition of the good  instructor is to give an examination which shall at once be thorough,  reasonable, and intelligently directed toward finding what the student  has really learned. His purpose is to test accurately the various  abilities which he has endeavored to encourage in the student during his  course. He wishes to ascertain how much the student has really  progressed.      _Specific suggestions on formulating questions_    In order to do this the examination must be on the really material  considerations of the history. Questions on unimportant details should  be omitted. The student should not be expected to burden his memory with  the limitless mass of petty isolated facts contained in the average  history text. The questions should be on considerations that have been  carefully discussed, and not on facts that have received but cursory  attention.    The examination should not require too much time for writing. The  several hours' continuous nervous tension sometimes exacted by too  ambitious teachers does the average child more harm than the  examination can possibly do him good.    The examination should consist of questions that will jointly or  severally test the student's powers of description, generalization, and  analysis. They should test his knowledge of the sequence of events, his  ability to use a library or a map, his knowledge of the various phases  and the various periods of the history studied. In every examination  there should be at least one question dealing with the time and the  order of events, one each on the geographical, political, and social  history, one that is analytical, one that requires generalization, one  that will test his knowledge of the library, and one that will test his  powers of description. It is not necessary to limit the questions to the  customary number of ten. It is frequently advisable to give a class some  degree of choice in the selection of their questions by requiring any  ten out of a larger number asked. Certainly such a plan gives the  student a more favorable opportunity to demonstrate his ability without  in the least diminishing the value of the examination.    Examination questions, like all other questions, should be definite,  clean-cut, and reasonable. If possible, each student should be supplied  with a copy, instead of having the set written on the board. They  should cover only those portions of the subject that have been properly  taught. The teacher should not expect the boy who has kept no useful  notes, whose library work has been haphazard, and whose methods of study  have not been supervised, to perform at examination time the miracle of  accurately remembering what he has never been properly taught.
