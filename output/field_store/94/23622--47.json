[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#8)"],[1,"that  the affected officers of Air New Zealand had engaged \"in a  pre-determined plan of deception ... to conceal a series of disastrous  administrative blunders\" (administrative mistakes which he himself had  found to be the real cause of the disaster) it is not unimportant to ask  what relevant information the airline had actually been able to provide  which was not supplied to Mr Chippindale. For that last reason the  material made available for consideration by Mr Chippindale deserves  some examination. An example concerns the change made to the final stage  of the computer flight track to the Antarctic which the Commissioner  regarded as a central reason for the accident. During a period of  fourteen months prior to the fatal flight Air New Zealand's ground  computer had contained an incorrect geographical reference to the  southern waypoint of the journey at McMurdo. Accordingly, in that period  it was shown incorrectly on any computer print-outs of the flight plan.  But a few hours before departure of the DC10 an amendment was made and  the flight crew was not informed that amended co-ordinates (since their  briefing 19 days earlier) had thus been fed into the aircraft's  computer.    In paragraph 44 the Report explains that the chief executive of the  airline was told of this matter on 30th November. Then in paragraph 45  it is said that the chief executive \"determined that no word of this  incredible blunder was to become publicly known\". There follows a  statement that a direction was thereupon given \"that all documents  relating to Antarctic flights, and to this flight in particular, were  to be collected and impounded. They were all to be put on one single  file which would remain in strict custody. Of these documents all those  which were not directly relevant were to be destroyed\". The reference in  this context to the amendment to the co-ordinates invites the question  as to whether Mr Chippindale had been given that particular information  by the airline during his own investigation. It is made plain in his own  report that this had been done immediately.    He himself was not uncritical of the administrative work of the airline  as it touched upon the fatal flight and concerning this matter he said:         \"3.5 The flight planned route entered in the company's base       computer was varied after the crew's briefing in that the position       for McMurdo on the computer printout used at the briefing, was       incorrect by over 2 degrees of longitude and was subsequently       corrected prior to this flight.\"    The variation in the computer _after the crew of the DC10 had been  briefed_ (as Mr Chippindale realized) is the matter which is mentioned  by the Commissioner in paragraph 44 and which in paragraph 45 is offered  as the motive for what is there described as an immediate decision by  the chief executive that no word of the matter was to become publicly  known, with documents to be impounded and others destroyed. This  information was given into Mr Chippindale's hands by Air New Zealand in  a written statement on the day following his return from the crash site  in Antarctica.    The Chippindale report then states in paragraph 3.6 that the computer  error had remained in the flight plans for some fourteen months. Then it  is said:         \"3.7 Some diagrams and maps issued at the route qualification       briefing could have been misleading in that they depicted a track       which passed to the true west of Ross Island over a sea level ice       shelf, whereas the flight planned track passed to the east over       high ground reaching to 12450 feet AMSL.         3.8 The briefing conducted by Air New Zealand Limited contained       omissions and inaccuracies which had not been detected by either       earlier participating aircrews or the supervising Airline       Inspectors.\"    So these various matters (also mentioned by the Commissioner) were well  within Mr Chippindale's knowledge. However he came to a final conclusion  that pilot error had been involved as a probable cause of the accident  while the Commissioner (who decided this was an incorrect finding) was  satisfied instead that the cause of the accident was not pilot error at  all. He said:         \"393. In my opinion therefore, the single dominant and effective       cause of the disaster was the mistake made by those airline       officials who programmed the aircraft to fly directly at Mt. Erebus       and omitted to tell the aircrew. That mistake is directly       attributable, not so much to the persons who made it, but to the       incompetent administrative airline procedures which made the       mistake possible.         394. In my opinion, neither Captain Collins nor First Officer       Cassin nor the flight engineers made any error which contributed to       the disaster, and were not responsible for its occurrence.\"      Jurisdiction to Review    Several important questions arise in this case. Is there jurisdiction in  the Courts to review in such a context as this taking into account the  ambit of ss. 3 and 4 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972? And if there  is such power is it by reason of the award of costs in this case? Or on  grounds relating to excess of jurisdiction on the part of the  Commissioner? Or considerations of natural justice? Or by reference to  all three of those matters? For the reasons that follow we are satisfied  that the findings are reviewable and that each one of those three  matters is properly within the scope of the Court's jurisdiction.    As already mentioned, the proceedings are by way of application for  review under the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and are directed against  certain findings in the Report, to which we have referred. The  applicants claim that those findings are invalid, in excess of  jurisdiction or made in circumstances involving unfairness or breach of  natural justice. They seek declarations to that effect and orders  setting aside the findings and quashing the order that Air New Zealand  pay $150,000 as a contribution to the public cost of the inquiry. It is  necessary to consider whether under the Act the Court has jurisdiction  to grant such relief in this case.    By ss. 3 and 4 of the Act relief may be granted only where a \"statutory  power\" is involved. That term includes a \"statutory power of decision\".  Since liberalizing amendments made in 1977, \"statutory power\" includes  power conferred by or under any Act \"to make any investigation or  inquiry into the rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, or  liabilities of any person\" and \"statutory power of decision\" includes  power conferred by or under any Act \"to make a decision ... affecting\"  any such rights, powers, privileges, duties or liabilities. Generally  the relief available is confined by s. 4 to that which the applicant  would have been entitled to in any one or more of the proceedings for  mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, declaration or injunction; but there  is a relevant exception in s. 4 (2) whereby if the applicant is entitled  to an order declaring that a decision made in the exercise of a  statutory power of decision is unauthorized or otherwise invalid the  Court may set aside the decision instead.    The first question as to jurisdiction is therefore whether, apart from  the 1972 Act, the applicants could have obtained relief by any of the  proceedings mentioned. The Commission having ceased to exist, it would  be too late to apply for prohibition or an injunction against the first  respondent and mandamus would also be inappropriate. The decision of  this Court in _Reynolds_ v. _Attorney-General_ (1909) 29 N.Z.L.R. 24,  37-38, suggests that once the report has been forwarded to the  Governor-General it may be permanently beyond the reach of certiorari;  this is perhaps a corollary of the view, to which we referred in the  judgment concerning discovery in _Environmental Defence Society Inc._  v. _South Pacific Aluminium Limited_ (C.A. 59/81, judgment 15th June  1981), that a prerogative remedy may not lie against the Sovereign's  representative.    But we need not go further into the rather technical question of the  scope of certiorari in this kind of case. As has been said in the  _Environmental Defence Society_ case and _Ng_ v. _Minister of Immigration_  (C.A. 100/81, judgment 10th August 1981), a declaration may be granted  in the discretion of the Court whether or not certiorari would have  lain. That a declaration may be an appropriate remedy for both  jurisdictional errors and closely analogous defects such as unfairness  or breaches of natural justice is shown by such Privy Council and House  of Lords decisions as _De Verteuil_ v. _Knaggs_ (1918) A.C. 557, _Pyx  Granite Co. Ltd._ v. _Ministry of Housing_ (1960) A.C. 260, and _Ridge_  v. _Baldwin_ (1964) A.C. 40. The statement apparently to the contrary at  the end of the _Reynolds_ judgment at p. 40 is obsolete. And if a  declaration could have been granted that a decision made under a  statutory power is invalid the Court has power under the 1972 Act to set  the decision aside.      The Order for Costs    In argument in the present case it was common ground that if the order  for $150,000 costs is invalid the Court can set it aside. That is  clearly so. The order was made in reliance on s. 11 of the Commissions  of Inquiry Act 1908 which (notwithstanding an argument to the contrary  by Mr Harrison) is in our opinion undoubtedly the only source of any  authority for a Royal Commission or a Commission of Inquiry to award  costs. If valid it is enforceable by virtue of s. 12 of that Act as a  final judgment of the High Court in its civil jurisdiction. Plainly it  is the exercise of a statutory power of decision. The jurisdiction of  the New Zealand Courts to determine the validity of orders for costs by  Commissions is well established: _Hughes_ v. _Hanna_ (1909) 29 N.Z.L.R.  16; _Whangarei Co-operative"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#8)"],[1,"of Australia, when--                They cross the rolling ocean,            Back from the fields of war,            To show the British medal            They got for guarding a store.              To show the British medal            On stations, towns, and farms,            They got for guarding the marmalade,            Far away from war's alarms.              To show the British medal,            With a blush of angry shame,            For which they went to risk their lives            In young Australia's name.              To show the British medal,            With a sneer that's half a sob,            Ere they pawn it to their uncle,            And go and drink the \"bob.\"      When we received notice to move away from Enslin down the line through  Graspan, Belmont, Orange River, to De Aar, our fellows were naturally very  wrathful; they had done splendid work for many weeks up that way; they had  dug trenches, sunk wells, drilled unceasingly; they had watched the kopjes  and scoured the veldt, and all that they were told to do they did like  soldiers--readily and uncomplainingly. The cold nights and the scorching  days, the monotonous drudgery, found them always ready and willing, because  they believed that when the order came for a great battle at Magersfontein,  or an onward march to Kimberley, they would be in the thick of it. But for  some reason, known only to those who gave the order, they were sent away  from the front, and they felt it keenly. From De Aar they were sent on to  Naauwpoort, and from this latter place they were forwarded on to Rensburg.    At Naauwpoort nearly all the Australians were mounted, and now acted as  mounted infantry. The horses supplied are Indian ponies, formerly used by  the Madras Cavalry. They are a first-class lot of cattle, well suited to  the work that lies before them, and have evidently been selected by someone  who knows his business a good deal better than a great number of his  colleagues. General French inspected the men at Rensburg during the first  day or two, and seemed fairly well satisfied with them, though, of course,  they did not make a first-class show in their initial efforts on horseback.  A great number of them rode well, but very few of them had ever gone  through a course of mounted drill, and it will take a week or two to knock  them into shape for this work; though, when once out of the saddle, they  are not in any way inferior to the best British regiments I have seen. But  they are keen to learn, and very willing, so that I expect to see them make  wonderfully rapid strides towards efficiency as mounted men. They seem to  feel that their only chance to get a fight is to become high grade  soldiers, and to that end they will stand all the work that can be crowded  into them. I have no idea what their future movements will be, nor do I  think anyone else connected with the regiment has; but one thing seems  certain, that sooner or later they will fall foul of the enemy in small  skirmishing parties, as the kopjes for a length of twenty miles are  infested by little bands of Boers, who have a knack of disappearing as soon  as a British force draws near them, only, however, to crop up again in a  fresh place, a short distance away.    For the Boer is a past master in this kind of warfare, and knows how to  play his own game to perfection. What the Goorkha is in Indian warfare, so  the Boer is in Africa. He does not fight in our style, but that does not  say that he cannot fight, neither does it argue that he is devoid of  courage. As a matter of fact, the more I have seen of this country, and  note what the Boers have done in opposition to all the might of Great  Britain, the more I am impressed with the idea that our alleged  Intelligence Department wants cutting down and burning root and branch, for  it must have been absolutely rotten, or unquestionably corrupt. We were led  by members of this Department to believe that the Boer was a cowardly kind  of veldt pariah, a degenerate offshoot of a fine old parent stock. Well,  the Boer is nothing of the kind. He is not in any way degenerate. He is a  good fighting man, according to his lights. He does not wear a stand-up  collar, nor an eyeglass, nor spats to his veldtschoon. He does not talk  with a silly lisp or an inane drawl. Therefore, the useless fellows whom  Britain trusted with the important task of watching him and sizing him up  counted him as a boor as well as a Boer--a mere country clod. But now, from  the rocky hills, these clods, these sons of semi-white savages, laugh at us  derisively, and answer our jeers with rifles that know how to speak in a  language that even the bravest of our troops have learnt to understand--and  respect.    I have a keen recollection of the last Franco-Prussian War. I remember how  the English newspapers ridiculed the French military authorities because,  whilst the Germans had accurate maps of every province within the French  borders, the French themselves were grossly ignorant of their own  territory. Now we can eat our own sarcasms and enjoy the bitter fruit of  our own irony, for, thanks to the Intelligence Department connected with  the War Office in Great Britain, we to-day stand precisely in the same  position towards our African enemy as France did towards Prussia. A glance  at the country through which I have recently passed shows only too clearly  that, whilst Paul Kruger and his advisers knew our full strength to a man,  we, on our part, knew nothing about him or the men, money, or ordnance at  his command. We knew nothing of the country which had been patiently  fortified by the best skilled military engineers in Europe. We know nothing  of his rocky, well-fortified country, which lies behind that which we have  already attacked. Our generals, instead of being supplied with maps  covering every inch of country within the enemy's borders, have to gather  information at the bayonet's point at a loss to the Empire in men, money,  and in prestige. If our commanders blunder, who is to blame but the  criminally negligent officials who have supplied them with false or foolish  data to work upon? The Empire has been betrayed, either wilfully or through  crass idleness upon the part of men who have dipped deeply into the  Empire's coffers, and the nation should demand their impeachment, apart  from their position, place, or power, and punishment of the most drastic  kind should follow speedily in the footsteps of impeachment.    The failure of General Buller to relieve Ladysmith was not due to any want  of sagacity on the part of that General. It was not due to any want of  bravery on the part of his troops. The General is worthy of his rank, and  worthy of the confidence of the nation, and his troops are as good as the  men who, under the same flag, taught the Russians to respect the power of  Britain. The cause of the failure lay mainly in the want of knowledge on  our part concerning the strength of the country the Boers held, and the  strength of the country they had to fall back upon when hard pressed.    That information the \"Intelligence\" Department ought to have been able to  place in the hands of General Buller before he moved forward to the relief  of the beleaguered garrison in Ladysmith. But they could not give what they  had never possessed.    Right up to the present moment, when the Boers have been forced to meet our  troops at close quarters, they have been found to possess no other arms  than the rifle. This has given truth to the belief that the enemy as an  attacking force is next door to useless, as no men, no matter how brave and  determined, could do very much damage to first-class troops armed with the  bayonet.    However, there is a whisper in the air that the Boers are not deficient in  side-arms; it is rumoured that the President of the Boer Republic has  immense supplies of offensive as well as defensive weapons safely placed  away until they may be required Right up to date his war policy has been to  remain passive, excepting in a few isolated positions, allowing the British  to attack his generals in almost impregnable positions, and by so doing put  heart into the burghers, and dishearten our forces. But should the tide of  war continue to roll onward in his favour he may attempt to put in force  the oft-told Boer threat, and try to sweep the British into the sea. Should  that day dawn, it is rumoured that the enemy will be found well supplied  with side-arms and with mercenaries trained to their use in one of the best  schools that modern times have known. Where do these rumours come from?  Well, a Boer prisoner, taunted perhaps by a guard, loses his temper and  drops a hint, or a Boer farmer, exultant over the latest news of his  countrymen's success, lifts the veil a little, and a jealously-guarded  secret drops out; or, again, a Boer's wife or daughter, flinging a taunt at  a cursed \"Rooinek,\" allows her temper to run away with her discretion.  There are a hundred ways in which such things get about; only straws,  perhaps, but a straw can point the way windward. A talkative Kaffir who has  been reared on a Dutch farm will at times give things away that would cost  him his life if the length of his tongue was known to his master;  especially will the nigger talk if his mouth be judiciously moistened with  Cape smoke brandy.    Information that comes to a war correspondent's hand is of many colours,  shapes, and sizes, but if he is born to the business he pieces the whole  together and picks out what seemeth good to his own soul at the finish.  Sometimes, at the end of a week's hard work, he finds himself possessed of  a patchwork of information like unto Joseph's coat of many colours, but it  is hard fortune indeed if he cannot find something in the lot to repay him  for his earnest endeavours.
